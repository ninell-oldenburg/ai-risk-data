It&#x2019;s the stuff you know because someone told you about it. If you know the Earth is round because you read it in a book, that&#x2019;s doxa.</p><p>Episteme is what we most often mean by &#x201C;knowledge&#x201D; in English. It&#x2019;s the stuff you know because you thought about it and reasoned it out. If you know the Earth is round because you measured shadows at different locations and did the math to prove that the only logical conclusion is that the Earth is round, that&#x2019;s episteme.</p><p>Gnosis has no good equivalent in English, but the closest we come is when people talk about personal experience because gnosis is the stuff you know because you experienced it. If you know the Earth is round because you traveled all the way around it or observed it from space, that&#x2019;s gnosis.</p><p>Often we elide these distinctions. Doxa of episteme is frequently thought of as episteme because if you read enough about how others gained episteme you may feel as though you have episteme yourself. This would be like hearing lots of people tell you how they worked out that the Earth is round and thinking that this gives you episteme rather than doxa. The mistake is understandable: as long as you only hear others talk about their episteme it&#x2019;s easy to pattern match and think you have it too, but as soon as you try to explain your supposed episteme to someone else you will quickly discover if you only have doxa instead. The effect is so strong that experts in fields often express that they never really knew their subject <a href=""https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/8742/did-einstein-say-if-you-cant-explain-it-simply-you-dont-understand-it-well-en"">until they had to teach it</a>.</p><p>In the same way episteme is often mistaken for gnosis. At least since the time of Ptolemy people have had episteme of the spherical nature of the Earth, and since the 1970s most people have seen pictures showing that the Earth is round, but astronauts continue <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overview_effect"">to experience gnosis of Earth&#x2019;s roundness the first time they fly in space</a>. It seems no matter how much epistemic reckoning we do or how accurate and precise our epistemic predictions are, we are still sometimes surprised to experience what we previously only believed.</p><span><figure><img src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*TwP_I7Ik7PdGE7IQ1lD2bw.jpeg"" class=""draft-image "" style=""width:40%""></figure></span><p>But none of this is to say that gnosis is better than episteme or that episteme is better than doxa because each has value in different ways. Doxa is the only kind of knowledge that can be reliably and quickly shared, so we use it extensively in lieu of episteme or gnosis because both impose large costs on the knower to figure things out for themselves or cultivate experiences. Episteme is the only kind of knowledge that we can prove correct, so we often seek to replace doxa and gnosis with it when we want to be sure of ourselves. And gnosis is the only kind of knowledge available to <a href=""https://mapandterritory.org/is-feedback-suffering-cf18006deca8"">non-sentient processes</a>, so unless we wish to spend our days in disembodied deliberation we must at least develop gnosis of doxastic and epistemic knowledge to <a href=""https://entirelyuseless.wordpress.com/2017/10/06/the-self-and-disembodied-predictive-processing/"">give the larger parts of our brains</a> information to work with. So all three kinds of knowledge must be used together in our pursuit of understanding.</p><p>Unfortunately we tend to forget this and often privilege one kind of knowledge or discount another, resulting in several possible ways of failing to embrace the full richness of knowledge available to us. When a person downplays doxa relative to episteme and gnosis we might say they are too skeptical if we are generous and a sophist if we are not. When a person ignores episteme in favor of doxa and gnosis we might say they are unscientific or irrational. And when a person emphasizes doxa and episteme to the exclusion of gnosis we might call them an empiricist or, to be provocative, a <a href=""https://meaningness.com/rationalist-eternalism"">rationalist</a>.</p><p>In each case the cure is different. The sophist must learn <a href=""https://mapandterritory.org/cognitive-empathy-and-emotional-labor-cb256c38597d"">compassion and empathy</a> to be able to trust that producers of words, including their own past selves, may imbue them with some correlation to reality. The irrationalist must learn <a href=""https://mapandterritory.org/what-value-epicycles-f8358678a23a"">logic and parsimony</a> so that they may accurately predict the world they will find themselves in. And the rationalist must learn humility enough to trust experience when facing what they don&#x2019;t (<a href=""https://mapandterritory.org/inscrutable-ideas-c3211ee599af"">or can&#x2019;t</a>) know through doxa and episteme. None is better than the other; all three are missing out on the fullness of what we can know.</p><p>It&#x2019;s coincidental that ancient Greek chose to break knowledge into three kinds rather than two or four or five, but because it did we can think of doxa, episteme, and gnosis like the three legs of a stool. Each leg is necessary for the stool to stand, and if any one of them is too short or too long the stool will wobble. Pull one out and the stool will fall over. Only when all three are combined in equal measure do we get a study foundation to sit and think on.</p>",gworley,gordon-seidoh-worley,Gordon Seidoh Worley,

<hr/>
<p>I am now going to introduce some concepts that lack established names in the economics literature—though I don’t believe that any of the basic ideas are new to economics.
</p>
<p>
First, I want to distinguish between the standard economic concept of <em>efficiency</em> (as in efficient pricing) and the related but distinct concepts of <em>inexploitability</em> and <em>adequacy</em>, which are what usually matter in real life.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id=""i"">i.</h2>
<p>
Depending on the strength of your filter bubble, you may have met people who become angry when they hear the phrase “efficient markets,” taking the expression to mean that hedge fund managers are particularly wise, or that markets are particularly just.<sup><a href=""#footnote-1-definition"" name=""footnote-1-return"">1</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Part of where this interpretation appears to be coming from is a misconception that market prices reflect a judgment on anyone’s part about what price would be “best”—fairest, say, or kindest.
</p>
<p>
In a pre-market economy, when you offer somebody fifty carrots for a roasted antelope leg, your offer says something about how impressed you are with their work hunting down the antelope and how much reward you think that deserves from you. If they’ve dealt generously with you in the past, perhaps you ought to offer them more. This is the only instinctive notion people start with for what a price could mean: a personal interaction between Alice and Bob reflecting past friendships and a balance of social judgments.
</p>
<p>
In contrast, the economic notion of a market price is that for every loaf of bread bought, there is a loaf of bread sold; and therefore actual demand and actual supply are always equal. The market price is the input that makes the decreasing curve for demand as a function of price meet the increasing curve for supply as a function of price. This price is an “is” statement rather than an “ought” statement, an observation and not a wish.
</p>
<p>
In particular, an efficient market, from an economist’s perspective, is just one whose average price movement can’t be predicted by you.
</p>
<p>
If that way of putting it sounds odd, consider an analogy. Suppose you asked a well-designed superintelligent AI system to estimate how many hydrogen atoms are in the Sun. You don’t expect the superintelligence to produce an answer that is <em>exactly right</em> down to the last atom, because this would require measuring the mass of the Sun more finely than any measuring instrument you expect it to possess. At the same time, it would be very odd for you to say, “Well, I think the superintelligence will underestimate the number of atoms in the Sun by 10%, because hydrogen atoms are very light and the AI system might not take that into account.” Yes, hydrogen atoms are light, but the AI system knows that too. Any reason you can devise for how a superintelligence could underestimate the amount of hydrogen in the Sun is a possibility that the superintelligence can also see and take into account. So while you don’t expect the system to get the answer exactly right, you don’t expect that you <em>yourself</em> will be able to predict the <em>average value</em> of the error—to predict that the system will underestimate the amount by 10%, for example.
</p>
<p>
This is the property that an economist thinks an “efficient” price has. An efficient price can update sharply: the company can do worse or better than expected, and the stock can move sharply up or down on the news. In some cases, you can rationally expect volatility; you can predict that good news might arrive tomorrow and make the stock go up, balanced by a counter-possibility that the news will fail to arrive and the stock will go down. You could think the stock is 30% likely to rise by $10 and 20% likely to drop by $15 and 50% likely to stay the same. But you can’t predict in advance the <em>average value</em> by which the price will change, which is what it would take to make an expected profit by buying the stock or short-selling it.<sup><a href=""#footnote-2-definition"" name=""footnote-2-return"">2</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
When an economist says that a market price is efficient over a two-year time horizon, they mean: “The current price that balances the supply and demand of this financial instrument well reflects all public information affecting a boundedly rational estimate of the future supply-demand balancing point of this financial instrument in two years.” They’re relating the present intersection of these two curves to an idealized cognitive estimate of the curves’ future intersection.
</p>
<p>
But this is a long sentence in the language of a hunter-gatherer. If somebody doesn’t have all the terms of that sentence precompiled in their head, then they’re likely to interpret the sentence in the idiom of ordinary human life and ordinary human relationships.
</p>
<p>
People have an innate understanding of “true” in the sense of a map that reflects the territory, and they can imagine processes that produce good maps; but probability and microeconomics are less intuitive.<sup><a href=""#footnote-3-definition"" name=""footnote-3-return"">3</a></sup> What people hear when you talk about “efficient prices” is that a cold-blooded machine has determined that some people ought to be paid $9/hour. And they hear the economist saying nice things about the machine, praising it as “efficient,” implying that the machine is <em>right</em> about this $9/hour price being good for society, that this price well reflects what someone’s efforts are justly worth. They hear you agreeing with this pitiless machine’s judgment about how the intuitive web of obligations and incentives and reputation ought properly to cash out for a human interaction.
</p>
<p>
And in the domain of stocks, when stock prices are observed to swing widely, this intuitive view says that the market can’t be that smart after all. For if it were smart, would it keep turning out to be “wrong” and need to change its mind?
</p>
<p>
I once read a rather clueless magazine article that made fun of a political prediction market on the basis that when a new poll came out, the price of the prediction market moved. “It just tracks the polls!” the author proclaimed. But the point of the prediction market is not that it knows some fixed, objective chance with high accuracy. The point of a prediction market is that it summarizes all the information available to the market participants. If the poll moved prices, then the poll was new information that the market thought was important, and the market updated its belief, and this is just the way things should be.
</p>
<p>
In a liquid market, “price moves whose average direction you can predict in advance” correspond to both “places you can make a profit” and “places where you know better than the market.” A market that knows everything you know is a market where prices are “efficient” in the conventional economic sense—one where you can’t predict the net direction in which the price will change.
</p>
<p>
This means that the efficiency of a market is assessed relative to your own intelligence, which is fine. Indeed, it’s possible that the concept should be called “relative efficiency.” Yes, a superintelligence might be able to predict price trends that no modern human hedge fund manager could; but economists don’t think that today’s markets are efficient relative to a superintelligence.
</p>
<p>
Today’s markets may not be efficient relative to the smartest hedge fund managers, or efficient relative to corporate insiders with secret knowledge that hasn’t yet leaked. But the stock markets are efficient relative to you, and to me, and to your Uncle Albert who thinks he tripled his money through his incredible acumen in buying NetBet.com.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id=""ii"">ii.</h2>
<p>
Not everything that involves a financial price is efficient. There was recently a startup called Color Labs, aka Color.com, whose putative purpose was to let people share photos with their friends and see other photos that had been taken nearby. They closed $41 million in funding, including $20 million from the prestigious Sequoia Capital.
</p>
<p>
When the news of their funding broke, practically everyone on the online Hacker News forum was rolling their eyes and predicting failure. It seemed like a nitwit me-too idea to me too. And then, yes, Color Labs failed and the 20-person team sold themselves to Apple for $7 million and the venture capitalists didn’t make back their money. And yes, it sounds to me like the prestigious Sequoia Capital bought into the wrong startup.
</p>
<p>
If that’s all true, it’s not a coincidence that neither I nor any of the other onlookers could make money on our advance prediction. The startup equity market was <em>inefficient</em> (a price underwent a predictable decline), but it wasn’t <em>exploitable</em>.<sup><a href=""#footnote-4-definition"" name=""footnote-4-return"">4</a></sup> There was no way to make a profit just by predicting that Sequoia had overpaid for the stock it bought. Because, at least as of 2017, the market lacks a certain type and direction of liquidity: you can’t short-sell startup equity.<sup><a href=""#footnote-5-definition"" name=""footnote-5-return"">5</a></sup></p>
<p>What about houses? Millions of residential houses change hands every year, and they cost more than stock shares. If we expect the stock market to be well-priced, shouldn’t we expect the same of houses?
</p>
<p>
The answer is “no,” because you can’t short-sell a house. Sure, there are some ways to bet against aggregate housing markets, like shorting real estate investment trusts or home manufacturers. But in the end, hedge fund managers can’t make a synthetic financial instrument that behaves just like the house on 6702 West St. and sell it into the same housing market frequented by consumers like you. Which is why you might do very well to think for yourself about whether the price seems sensible to you before buying a house: because you might know better than the market price, even as a non-specialist relying only on publicly available information.
</p>
<p>
Let’s imagine there are 100,000 houses in Boomville, of which 10,000 have been for sale in the last year or so. Suppose there are 20,000 fools who think that housing prices in Boomville can only go up, and 10,000 rational hedge fund managers who think that the shale-oil business may collapse and lead to a predictable decline in Boomville house prices. There’s no way for the hedge fund managers to short Boomville house prices—not in a way that satisfies the optimistic demand of 20,000 fools for Boomville houses, not in a way that causes house prices to actually decline. The 20,000 fools just bid on the 10,000 available houses until the skyrocketing price of the houses makes 10,000 of the fools give up.
</p>
<p>
Some smarter agents might decline to buy, and so somewhat reduce demand. But the smarter agents can’t actually visit Boomville and make hundreds of thousands of dollars off of the overpriced houses. The price <em>is</em> too high and <em>will</em> predictably decline, relative to public information, but there’s no way you can make a profit on knowing that. An individual who owns an existing house can exploit the inefficiency by selling that house, but rational market actors can’t crowd around the inefficiency and exploit it until it’s all gone.
</p>
<p>
Whereas a predictably <em>underpriced</em> house, put on the market for predictably much less than its future price, would be an asset that any of a hundred thousand rational investors could come in and snap up.
</p>
<p>
So a frothy housing market may see many overpriced houses, but few underpriced ones.
</p>
<p>
Thus it will be easy to lose money in this market by buying stupidly, and much harder to make money by buying cleverly. The market prices will be <em>inefficient</em>—in a certain sense stupid—but they will not be <em>exploitable</em>.
</p>
<p>
In contrast, in a thickly traded market where it is easy to short an overpriced asset, prices will be efficient in both directions, and any day is as good a day to buy as any other. You may end up exposed to excess <em>volatility</em> (an asset with a 50% chance of doubling and a 50% chance of going bankrupt, for example), but you won’t actually have bought anything overpriced—if it were predictably overpriced, it would have been short-sold.<sup><a href=""#footnote-6-definition"" name=""footnote-6-return"">6</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
We can see the notion of an inexploitable market as generalizing the notion of an efficient market as follows: in both cases, <em>there’s no free energy inside the system</em>. In both markets, there’s a horde of hungry organisms moving around trying to eat up all the free energy. In the efficient market, <em>every predictable price change corresponds to free energy</em> (easy money) and so the equilibrium where hungry organisms have eaten all the free energy corresponds to an equilibrium of no predictable price changes. In a merely inexploitable market, there are predictable price changes that don’t correspond to free energy, like an overpriced house that will decline later, and so the no-free-energy equilibrium can still involve predictable price changes.<sup><a href=""#footnote-7-definition"" name=""footnote-7-return"">7</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Our ability to say, within the context of the general theory of “efficient markets,” that houses in Boomville may still be overpriced—and, additionally, to say that they are much less likely to be underpriced—is what makes this style of reasoning powerful. It doesn’t just say, “Prices are usually right when lots of money is flowing.” It gives us detailed conditions for when we should and shouldn’t expect efficiency. There’s an underlying logic about powerfully smart organisms, any single one of which can consume free energy if it is available in worthwhile quantities, in a way that produces a global equilibrium of no free energy; and if one of the premises is invalidated, we get a different prediction.
</p>

<p>
At one point during the 2016 presidential election, the PredictIt prediction market—the only one legally open to US citizens (and only US citizens)—had Hillary Clinton at a 60% probability of winning the general election. The bigger, international prediction market BetFair had Clinton at 80% at that time.
</p>
<p>
So I looked into buying Clinton shares on PredictIt—but discovered, alas, that PredictIt charged a 10% fee on profits, a 5% fee on withdrawals, had an $850 limit per contract bet… and on top of all that, I’d also have to pay 28% federal and 9.3% state income taxes on any gains. Which, in sum, meant I wouldn’t be getting much more than $30 in expected return for the time and hassle of buying the contracts.
</p>
<p>
Oh, if only PredictIt didn’t charge that 10% fee on profits, that 5% fee on withdrawals! If only they didn’t have the $850 limit! If only the US didn’t have such high income taxes, and didn't limit participation in overseas prediction markets! I could have bought Clinton shares at 60 cents on PredictIt and Trump shares at 20 cents on Betfair, winning a dollar either way and getting a near-guaranteed 25% return until the prices were in line! Curse those silly rules, preventing me from picking up that free money!
</p>
<p>
Does that complaint sound reasonable to you?
</p>
<p>
If so, then you haven’t yet fully internalized the notion of an inefficient-but-inexploitable market.
</p>
<p>
If the taxes, fees, and betting limits hadn’t been there, the PredictIt and BetFair prices would have been the same.

Suppose it were the case that some cases of Seasonal Affective Disorder proved resistant to sitting in front of a 10,000-lux lightbox for 30 minutes (the standard treatment), but would nonetheless respond if you bought 130 or so 60-watt-equivalent high-CRI LED bulbs, in a mix of 5000K and 2700K color temperatures, and strung them up over your two-bedroom apartment.
</p>
<p>
Would you expect that, supposing this were true, there would already exist a journal report somewhere on it?
</p>
<p>
Would you expect that, supposing this were true, it would already be widely discussed (or at least rumored) on the Internet?
</p>
<p>
Would you expect that, supposing this were true, doctors would already know about it and it would be on standard medical pages about Seasonal Affective Disorder?
</p>
<p>
And would you, failing to observe anything on the subject after a couple of hours of Googling, conclude that your civilization must have some unknown good reason why not everyone was doing this already?
</p>
<p>
To answer a question like this, we need an analysis not of the world’s efficiency or inexploitability but rather of its <em>adequacy</em>—whether all the low-hanging fruit have been plucked.
</p>
<p>
A duly modest skepticism, translated into the terms we’ve been using so far, might say something like this: “Around 7% of the population has severe Seasonal Affective Disorder, and another 20% or so has weak Seasonal Affective Disorder. Around 50% of tested cases respond to standard lightboxes. So if the intervention of stringing up a hundred LED bulbs actually worked, it could provide a major improvement to the lives of 3% of the US population, costing on the order of $1000 each (without economies of scale). Many of those 9 million US citizens would be rich enough to afford that as a treatment for major winter depression. If you could prove that your system worked, you could create a company to sell SAD-grade lighting systems and have a large market. So by postulating that you can cure SAD this way, you’re postulating a world in which there’s a huge quantity of metaphorical free energy—a big energy gradient that society hasn’t traversed. Therefore, I’m skeptical of this medical theory for more or less the same reason that I’m skeptical you can make money on the stock market: it postulates a $20 bill lying around that nobody has already picked up.”
</p>
<p>
So the distinction is:
</p><ul><li>
<p>
<strong>Efficiency</strong>: “Microsoft’s stock price is neither too low nor too high, relative to anything <em>you</em> can possibly know about Microsoft’s stock price.”
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Inexploitability</strong>: “Some houses and housing markets are overpriced, but you can’t make a profit by short-selling them, and you’re unlikely to find any substantially <em>underpriced</em> houses—the market as a whole isn’t rational, but it contains participants who have money and understand housing markets as well as you do.”
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Adequacy</strong>: “Okay, the medical sector is a wildly crazy place where different interventions have orders-of-magnitude differences in cost-effectiveness, but at least there’s no well-known but unused way to save <em>ten thousand lives for just ten dollars each</em>, right? <em>Somebody</em> would have picked up on it! Right?!”
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Let’s say that within some slice through society, the obvious low-hanging fruit that save <em>more</em> than ten thousand lives for less than a hundred thousand dollars total have, in fact, been picked up. Then I propose the following terminology: let us say that that part of society is <em>adequate</em> at saving 10,000 lives for $100,000.
</p>
<p>
And if there’s a convincing case that this property does not hold, we’ll say this subsector is <em>inadequate</em> (at saving 10,000 lives for $100,000).
</p>
<p>
To see how an inadequate equilibrium might arise, let’s start by focusing on one tiny subfactor of the human system, namely academic research.
</p>
<p>
We’ll even further oversimplify our model of academia and pretend that research is a two-factor system containing <em>academics</em> and <em>grantmakers</em>, and that a project can only happen if there’s both a participating academic and a participating grantmaker.
</p>
<p>
We next suppose that in some academic field, there exists a population of researchers who are individually eager and collectively opportunistic for publications—papers accepted to journals, especially high-impact journal publications that constitute strong progress toward tenure. For any clearly visible opportunity to get a sufficiently large number of citations with a small enough amount of work, there are collectively enough academics in this field that somebody will snap up the opportunity. We could say, to make the example more precise, that the field is collectively opportunistic in 2 citations per workday—if there’s any clearly visible opportunity to do 40 days of work and get 80 citations, somebody in the field will go for it.
</p>
<p>
This level of opportunism might be much more than the average paper gets in citations per day of work. Maybe the average is more like 10 citations per year of work, and lots of researchers work for a year on a paper that ends up garnering only 3 citations. We’re not trying to ask about the <em>average</em> price of a citation; we’re trying to ask how cheap a citation has to be before <em>somebody somewhere</em> is virtually <em>guaranteed</em> to try for it.
</p>
<p>
But academic paper-writers are only half the equation; the other half is a population of grantmakers.
</p>
<p>
In this model, can we suppose for argument’s sake that grantmakers are motivated by the pure love of all sentient life, and yet we still end up with an academic system that is <em>inadequate</em>?
</p>
<p>
I might naively reply: “Sure. Let’s say that those selfish academics are collectively opportunistic at two citations per workday, and the blameless and benevolent grantmakers are collectively opportunistic at one quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) per $100.<sup><a href=""#footnote-8-definition"" name=""footnote-8-return"">8</a></sup> Then everything which produces one QALY per $100 <em>and</em> two citations per workday gets funded. Which means there could be an obvious, clearly visible project that would produce a thousand QALYs per dollar, and so long as it doesn’t produce enough citations, nobody will work on it. That’s what the model says, right?”
</p>
<p>
Ah, but this model has a <em>fragile</em> equilibrium of inadequacy. It only takes one researcher who is opportunistic in QALYs and willing to take a hit in citations to snatch up the biggest, lowest-hanging altruistic fruit if there’s a population of grantmakers eager to fund projects like that.
</p>
<p>
Assume the most altruistically neglected project produces 1,000 QALYs per dollar. If we add a single rational and altruistic researcher to this model, then they will work on that project, whereupon the equilibrium will be adequate at 1,000 QALYs per dollar. If there are two rational and altruistic researchers, the second one to arrive will start work on the next-most-neglected project—say, a project that has 500 QALYs/$ but wouldn’t garner enough citations for whatever reason—and then the field will be adequate at 500 QALYs/$. As this free energy gets eaten up (it’s tasty energy from the perspective of an altruist eager for QALYs), the whole field becomes less inadequate in the relevant respect.
</p>
<p>
But this assumes the grantmakers are eager to fund highly efficient QALY-increasing projects.
</p>
<p>
Suppose instead that the grantmakers are <em>not</em> cause-neutral scope-sensitive effective altruists assessing QALYs/$. Suppose that most grantmakers pursue, say, <em>prestige per dollar</em>. (Robin Hanson offers an elementary argument that most grantmaking to academia is about prestige.<sup><a href=""#footnote-9-definition"" name=""footnote-9-return"">9</a></sup> In any case, we can provisionally assume the prestige model for purposes of this toy example.)
</p>
<p>
From the perspective of most grantmakers, the ideal grant is one that gets their individual name, or their boss’s name, or their organization’s name, in newspapers around the world in close vicinity to phrases like “Stephen Hawking” or “Harvard professor.” Let’s say for the purpose of this thought experiment that the population of grantmakers is collectively opportunistic in 20 microHawkings per dollar, such that at least one of them will definitely jump on any clearly visible opportunity to affiliate themselves with Stephen Hawking for $50,000. Then at equilibrium, everything that provides at least 2 citations per workday <em>and</em> 20 microHawkings per dollar will get done.
</p>
<p>
This doesn’t quite follow logically, because the stock market is far more efficient at matching bids between buyers and sellers than academia is at matching researchers to grantmakers. (It’s not like anyone in our civilization has put as much effort into rationalizing the academic matching process as, say, OkCupid has put into their software for hooking up dates. It’s not like anyone who did produce this public good would get paid more than they could have made as a Google programmer.)
</p>
<p>
But even if the argument is still missing some pieces, you can see the general shape of this style of analysis. If a piece of research will clearly visibly yield lots of citations with a reasonable amount of labor, and make the grantmakers on the committee look good for not too much money committed, then a researcher eager to do it can probably find a grantmaker eager to fund it.
</p>
<p>
But what if there’s some intervention which could save 100 QALYs/$, yet produces neither great citations nor great prestige? Then if we add a few altruistic researchers to the model, they probably won’t be able to find a grantmaker to fund it; and if we add a few altruistic grantmakers to the model, they probably won’t be able to find a qualified researcher to work on it.
</p>
<p>
One systemic problem can often be overcome by one altruist in the right place. <em>Two</em> systemic problems are another matter entirely.
</p>
<p>
Usually when we find trillion-dollar bills lying on the ground in real life, it’s a symptom of (1) a central-command bottleneck that nobody else is allowed to fix, as with the European Central Bank wrecking Europe, or (2) a system with enough moving parts that <em>at least two parts are simultaneously broken</em>, meaning that <em>single actors cannot defy the system</em>. To modify an old aphorism: usually, when things suck, it’s because they suck in a way that’s a Nash equilibrium.
</p>
<p>
In the same way that <em>inefficient</em> markets tend systematically to be <em>inexploitable</em>, grossly <em>inadequate</em> systems tend systematically to be <em>unfixable</em> by individual non-billionaires.
</p>
<p>
But then you can sometimes still insert a wedge for yourself, even if you can’t save the whole system. Something that’s systemically hard to fix for the whole planet is sometimes possible to fix in your own two-bedroom apartment. So inadequacy is even more important than exploitability on a day-to-day basis, because it’s inadequacy-generating situations that lead to low-hanging fruits large enough to be worthwhile at the individual level.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id=""v"">v.</h2>
<p>
A critical analogy between an inadequate system and an efficient market is this: even systems that are horribly inadequate from our own perspective <em>are still in a competitive equilibrium</em>. There’s still an equilibrium of incentives, an equilibrium of supply and demand, an equilibrium where (in the central example above) all the researchers are vigorously competing for prestigious publications and using up all available grant money in the course of doing so. There’s no free energy anywhere in the system.
</p>
<p>
I’ve seen a number of novice rationalists committing what I shall term the Free Energy Fallacy, which is something along the lines of, “This system’s purpose is supposed to be to cook omelettes, and yet it produces terrible omelettes. So why don’t I use my amazing skills to cook some better omelettes and take over?”
</p>
<p>
And generally the answer is that maybe the system from <em>your</em> perspective is broken, but everyone within the system is intensely competing along <em>other</em> dimensions and you can’t keep up with that competition. They’re all chasing whatever things people in that system actually pursue—instead of the lost purposes they wistfully remember, but don’t have a chance to pursue because it would be career suicide. You won’t become competitive along those dimensions just by cooking better omelettes.
</p>
<p>
No researcher has any spare attention to give your improved omelette-cooking idea because they are already using all of their labor to try to get publications into high-impact journals; they have no free work hours.
</p>
<p>
The journals won’t take your omelette-cooking paper because they get <em>lots</em> of attempted submissions that they screen, for example, by looking for whether the researcher is from a high-prestige institution or whether the paper is written in a style that makes it look technically difficult. Being good at cooking omelettes doesn’t make you the <em>best</em> competitor at writing papers to appeal to prestigious journals—any publication slot would have to be given to you rather than someone else who is intensely trying to get it. Your good omelette technique might be a <em>bonus</em>, but only if you were already doing everything else right (which you’re not).
</p>
<p>
The grantmakers have no free money to give you to run your omelette-cooking experiment, because there are thousands of researchers competing for their money, and you are not competitive at convincing grantmaking committees that you’re a safe, reputable, prestigious option. Maybe they feel wistfully fond of the ideal of better omelettes, but it would be career suicide for them to give money to the wrong person because of that.
</p>
<p>
What inadequate systems and efficient markets have in common is the lack of any free energy in the equilibrium. We can see the equilibrium in both cases as <em>defined</em> by an absence of free energy. In an efficient market, any predictable price change corresponds to free energy, so thousands of hungry organisms trying to eat the free energy produce a lack of predictable price changes. In a system like academia, the competition for free energy may not correspond to anything good from your own standpoint, and as a result you may label the outcome “inadequate”; but there is still no free energy. Trying to feed <em>within</em> the system, or do anything within the system that uses a resource the other competing organisms want—money, publication space, prestige, attention—will generally be as hard for you as it is for any other organism.
</p>
<p>
Indeed, if the system gave priority to rewarding better performance along the most useful or socially beneficial dimensions over all competing ways of feeding, the system wouldn’t be inadequate in the first place. It’s like wishing PredictIt didn’t have fees and betting limits so that you could snap up those mispriced contracts.
</p>
<p>
In a way, it’s this very lack of free energy, this intense competition without space to draw a breath, that keeps the inadequacy around and makes it non-fragile. In the case of US science, there was a brief period after World War II where there was new funding coming in faster than universities could create new grad students, and scientists had a chance to pursue ideas that they liked. Today Malthus has reasserted himself, and it’s no longer generally feasible for people to achieve career success while going off and just pursuing the research they most enjoy, or just going off and pursuing the research with the largest altruistic benefits. For any actor to do the best thing from an altruistic standpoint, they’d need to ignore all of the system’s internal incentives pointing somewhere else, and there’s no free energy in the system to feed someone who does that.<sup><a href=""#footnote-10-definition"" name=""footnote-10-return"">10</a></sup>

<p>
Since the idea of civilizational adequacy seems fairly useful and general, I initially wondered whether it might be a known idea (under some other name) in economics textbooks. But my friend Robin Hanson, a professional economist at an academic institution well-known for its economists, has written a lot of material that I see (from this theoretical perspective) as doing backwards reasoning from inadequacy to incentives.<sup><a href=""#footnote-11-definition"" name=""footnote-11-return"">11</a></sup> If there were a widespread economic notion of adequacy that he were invoking, or standard models of academic incentives and academic inadequacy, I would expect him to cite them.
</p>
<p>
Now look at the above paragraph. Can you spot the two <em>implicit</em> arguments from adequacy?
</p>
<p>
The first sentence says, “To the extent that this way of generalizing the notion of an efficient market is conceptually useful, we should expect the field of economics to have been <em>adequate</em> to have already explored it in papers, and adequate at the task of disseminating the resulting knowledge to the point where my economist friends would be familiar with it.”
</p>
<p>
The second and third sentences say, “If something like inadequacy analysis were already a well-known idea in economics, then I would expect my smart economist friend Robin Hanson to cite it. Even if Robin started out not knowing, I expect his other economist friends would tell him, or that one of the many economists reading his blog would comment on it. I expect the population of economists reading Robin’s blog and papers to be <em>adequate</em> to the task of telling Robin about an existing field here, if one already existed.”
</p>
<p>
Adequacy arguments are <em>ubiquitous</em>, and they’re much more common in everyday reasoning than arguments about efficiency or exploitability.
</p>

<p>
Returning to that business of stringing up 130 light bulbs around the house to treat my wife’s Seasonal Affective Disorder:
</p>
<p>
Before I started, I tried to Google whether anyone had given “put up a ton of high-quality lights” a shot as a treatment for resistant SAD, and didn’t find anything. Whereupon I shrugged, and started putting up LED bulbs.
</p>
<p>
Observing these choices of mine, we can infer that my inadequacy analysis was something like this: First, I did spend a fair amount of time Googling, and tried harder after the first search terms failed. This implies I started out thinking my civilization might have been adequate to think of the <em>more light</em> treatment and test it.
</p>
<p>
Then when I didn’t find anything on Google, I went ahead and tested the idea myself, at considerable expense. I <em>didn’t</em> assign such a high probability to “if this is a good idea, people will have tested it and propagated it to the point where I could find it” that in the absence of Google results, I could infer that the idea was bad.
</p>
<p>
I initially tried ordering the cheapest LED lights from Hong Kong that I could find on eBay. I didn’t feel like I could rely on the US lighting market to equalize prices with Hong Kong, and so I wasn’t confident that the premium price for US LED bulbs represented a quality difference. But when the cheap lights finally arrived from Hong Kong, they were dim, inefficient, and of visibly low color quality. So I decided to buy the more expensive US light bulbs for my next design iteration.
</p>
<p>
That is: I tried to save money based on a possible local inefficiency, but it turned out not to be inefficient, or at least not inefficient enough to be easily exploited by me. So I updated on that observation, discarded my previous belief, and changed my behavior.
</p>
<p>
Sometime after putting up the first 100 light bulbs or so, I was working on an earlier draft of this chapter and therefore reflecting more intensively on my process than I usually do. It occurred to me that sometimes the best academic content isn’t online <em>and</em> that it might not be expensive to test that. So I ordered a used $6 edited volume on Seasonal Affective Disorder, in case my Google-fu had failed me, hoping that a standard collection of papers would mention a light-intensity response curve that went past “standard lightbox.”
</p>
<p>
Well, I’ve flipped through that volume, and so far it doesn’t seem to contain any account of anyone having ever tried to cure resistant SAD using <em>more light</em>, either substantially higher-intensity or substantially higher-duration. I didn’t find any table of response curves to light levels above 10,000 lux, or any experiments with all-day artificial light levels comparable to my apartment’s roughly 2,000-lux luminance.
</p>
<p>
I say this to emphasize that I didn’t lock myself into my attempted reasoning about adequacy when I realized it would cost $6 to perform a further observational check. And to be clear, ordering one book still isn’t a strong check. It wouldn’t surprise me in the least to learn that at least one researcher somewhere on Earth had tested the obvious thought of <em>more light</em> and published the response curve. But I’d also hesitate to bet at odds very far from 1:1 in either direction.
</p>
<p>
And the higher-intensity light therapy does seems to have mostly cured Brienne’s SAD. It wasn’t cheap, but it was cheaper than sending her to Chile for 4 months.
</p>
<p>
If <em>more light</em> really is a simple and effective treatment for a large percentage of otherwise resistant patients, is it truly plausible that no academic researcher out there has ever conducted the first investigation to cross my own mind? “Well, since the Sun itself clearly does work, let’s try <em>more light</em> throughout the <em>whole house</em>—never mind these dinky lightboxes or 30-minute exposure times—and then just keep adding more light until it frickin’ works.” Is that really so non-obvious? With so many people around the world suffering from severe or subclinical SAD that resists lightboxes, with whole <em>countries</em> in the far North or South where the syndrome is common, could that experiment really have never been tried in a formal research setting?
</p>
<p>
On my model of the world? Sure.
</p>
<p>
Am I running out and trying to get a SAD researcher interested in my anecdotal data? No, because when something like this doesn’t get done, there’s usually a deeper reason than “nobody thought of it.”
</p>
<p>
Even if nobody <em>did</em> think of it, that says something about a lack of incentives to be creative. If academics expected working solutions to SAD to be rewarded, there would already be a much larger body of literature on weird things researchers had tried, not just lightbox variant after lightbox variant. Inadequate systems tend systematically to be systemically unfixable; I don’t know the exact details in this case, but there’s probably something somewhere.
</p>
<p>
So I don’t expect to get rich or famous, because I don’t expect the system to be that exploitable in dollars or esteem, even though it <em>is</em> exploitable in personalized SAD treatments. Empirically, lots of people want money and acclaim, and base their short- and long-term career decisions around its pursuit; so achieving it in unusually large quantities shouldn’t be as simple as having one bright idea. But there aren’t large groups of competent people visibly organizing their day-to-day lives around producing outside-the-box new lightbox alternatives with the same intensity we can observe people organizing their lives around paying the bills, winning prestige or the acclaim of peers, etc.
</p>
<p>
People presumably <em>care</em> about curing SAD—if they could effortlessly push a button to instantly cure SAD, they would do so—but there’s a big difference between “caring” and “caring enough to prioritize this over nearly everything else I care about,” and it’s the latter that would be needed for researchers to be willing to personally trade away non-small amounts of expected money or esteem for new treatment ideas.<sup><a href=""#footnote-12-definition"" name=""footnote-12-return"">12</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In the case of Japan’s monetary policy, it wasn’t a coincidence that I couldn’t get rich by understanding macroeconomics better than the Bank of Japan. Japanese asset markets shot up as soon as it became known that the Bank of Japan would create more money, without any need to wait and see—so it turns out that the markets also understood macroeconomics better than the Bank of Japan. Part of our civilization was being, in a certain sense, stupid: there were trillion-dollar bills lying around for the taking. But they weren’t trillion-dollar bills that just anyone could walk over and pick up.
</p>
<p>
From the standpoint of a single agent like myself, that ecology didn’t contain the particular kind of free energy that lots of other agents were competing to eat. I could be unusually right about macroeconomics compared to the PhD-bearing professionals at the Bank of Japan, but that weirdly low-hanging epistemic fruit wasn’t a low-hanging financial fruit; I couldn’t use the excess knowledge to easily get excess money deliverable the next day.
</p>
<p>
Where reward doesn’t follow success, or where not everyone can individually pick up the reward, institutions and countries and whole civilizations can fail at what is usually imagined to be their tasks. And then it is very much easier to do better in some dimensions than to profit in others.
</p>
<p>
To state all of this more precisely: Suppose there is some space of strategies that you’re competent enough to think up and execute on. <em>Inexploitability</em> has a single unit attached, like “$” or “effective SAD treatments,” and says that you can’t find a strategy in this space that knowably gets you much more of the resource in question than other agents. The kind of inexploitability I’m interested in typically arises when a large ecosystem of competing agents is genuinely trying to get the resource in question, and has access to strategies at least as good (for acquiring that resource) as the best options in your strategy space.
</p>
<p>
<em>Inadequacy</em> with respect to a strategy space has two units attached, like “effective SAD treatments / research hours” or “QALYs / $,” and says that there is some set of strategies a large ecosystem of agents could pursue that would convert the denominator unit into the numerator unit at some desired rate, but the agents are pursuing strategies that in fact result in a lower conversion rate. The kind of inadequacy I’m most interested in arises when many of the agents in the ecosystem would prefer that the conversion occur at the rate in question, but there’s some systemic blockage preventing this from happening.
</p>
<p>
Systems tend to be inexploitable with respect to the resources that large ecosystems of competent agents are trying their hardest to pursue, like fame and money, regardless of how adequate or inadequate they are. And if there are other resources the agents aren’t adequate at converting fame, money, etc. into at a widely desired rate, it will often be due to some systemic blockage. Insofar as agents have overlapping goals, it will therefore often be harder than it looks to find real instances of exploitability, and harder than it looks to outperform an inadequate equilibrium. But more local goals tend to overlap less: there isn’t a large community of specialists specifically trying to improve my wife’s well-being.
</p>
<p>
The academic and medical system probably isn’t that easy to exploit in dollars or esteem, but so far it does look like maybe the system is exploitable in SAD innovations, due to being <em>inadequate</em> to the task of converting dollars, esteem, researcher hours, etc. into new SAD cures at a reasonable rate—inadequate, for example, at investigating some SAD cures that Randall Munroe would have considered obvious,<sup><a href=""#footnote-13-definition"" name=""footnote-13-return"">13</a></sup> or at doing the basic investigative experiments that I would have considered obvious. And when the world is like that, it’s possible to cure someone’s crippling SAD by thinking carefully about the problem yourself, even if your civilization doesn’t have a mainstream answer.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id=""viii"">viii.</h2>
<p>
There’s a whole lot more to be said about how to think about inadequate systems: common conceptual tools include Nash equilibria, commons problems, asymmetrical information, principal-agent problems, and more. There’s also a whole lot more to be said about how <em>not</em> to think about inadequate systems.
</p>
<p>
In particular, if you relax your self-skepticism even slightly, it’s trivial to come up with an <em>a priori</em> inadequacy argument for just about anything. Talk about “efficient markets” in any less than stellar forum, and you’ll soon get half a dozen comments from people deriding the stupidity of hedge fund managers. And, yes, the financial system is broken in a lot of ways, but you still can’t double your money trading S&amp;P 500 stocks. “Find one thing to deride, conclude inadequacy” is not a good rule.
</p>
<p>
At the same time, lots of real-world social systems <em>do</em> have inadequate equilibria and it <em>is</em> important to be able to understand that, especially when we have clear observational evidence that this is the case. A blanket distrust of inadequacy arguments won’t get us very far either.
</p>
<p>
This is one of those ideas where other cognitive skills are required to use it correctly, and you can shoot off your own foot by thinking wrongly. So if you’ve read this far, it’s probably a good idea to keep reading.

What&#x27;s going on?</p><h2>Adding normative assumptions</h2><p>To tackle this, we need to add normative assumptions. Normative assumptions are simply assumptions that distinguish between two pairs (p, R) (p&#x27;, R&#x27;) that lead to the same policy: p(R)=p&#x27;(R&#x27;).</p><p>Since those pairs predict the same policy, they cannot be distinguished via observations. So a normative assumption is an extra piece, that cannot itself be deduced from observation, and distinguishes between planner-reward pairs.</p><p>Because normative assumptions cannot be deduced from observations, <strong>they are part of the definition of the human reward function.</strong> They are not abstract means of converging on this true reward; they are <a href=""https://www.lesserwrong.com/posts/RHvseCkfrYzoHJj7M/learning-values-or-defining-them"">part of the procedure that defines this reward</a>.</p><h2>What are they?</h2><p>There are two way of seeing such normative assumptions. The first is as an extra update rule: upon seeing observation o, the probabilities of (p, R) and (p&#x27;, R&#x27;) would normally go to α and α&#x27;, but, with the normative assumption, there is an extra update to the relative probabilities of the two.</p><p>Equivalently, a normative assumption can be seen as an adjustment to the priors of these pairs. The two approaches are equivalent, but sometimes an extra update is computationally tractable whereas the equivalent prior would be intractable (and vice-versa).</p><h2>Example: regret</h2><p>So, if normative assumptions are definitions of rationality/reward, what are good candidates to pick? How do we, as humans, define our own rationality and reward?</p><p>Well, one strong way seems to be through our feeling of regret (human regret, not <a href=""https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~avrim/Papers/regret-chapter.pdf"">regret in the machine learning sense</a>). We often feel and express regret when something turns out the wrong way from what we wanted. If we take &quot;feelings and expressions of regret encode true reward information&quot; as a normative assumption, then this restricts the number of (p, R) pairs that are compatible with such an assumption.</p><p>In a very simple example, someone has a 50% chance of receiving either a sword (s) or an iPhone (i). After that, they will either say h=&quot;I&#x27;m happy with my gift&quot;, or ~h=&quot;I&#x27;m unhappy with my gift&quot;.</p><p></p><span><figure><img src=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/kw70h25r7ma9xfl/regret.png?raw=1"" class=""draft-image "" style=""width:85%"" /></figure></span><p></p><p>The human&#x27;s reward is R(α, β, γ, δ) = αR(s-i) + βR(h-~h) + γR(h-~h|s) + δR(h-~h|i). The α, β, γ, and δ terms are constants (that can be negative). The R(s-i) expresses the extra reward the human gets from receiving the sword rather than the iPhone (if negative, it encodes the opposite reward preference). The R(h-~h) expresses the extra reward the human gets from say h as opposed to ~h; here h and ~h are seen as pure &quot;<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_act"">speech acts</a>&quot;, which don&#x27;t mean anything intrinsically.</p><p>The R(h-~h|s) expresses the same preference, conditional on the human having received the sword, and R(h-~h|i) expresses it conditional on the human having received the iPhone.</p><p>I&#x27;ll restrict to two planners, p, which is fully rational, and -p, which is fully anti-rational.</p><p>Assume the human will say h following s, and ~h following i (that&#x27;s the human &quot;policy&quot;). Then we are restricted to the following pairs:</p><ul><li>(p, R(α, β, γ, δ) | γ≥-β≥δ) or (-p, R(α, β, γ, δ) | γ≤-β≤δ).</li></ul><p>The conditions on the constants ensures the human will follow the correct policy. If we add the normative assumption about expressing regret, we can now say that the human values the sword more than the iPhone, and further restrict to:</p><ul><li>(p, R(α, β, γ, δ) | γ≥-β≥δ, α≥0) or (-p, R(α, β, γ, δ) | γ≤-β≤δ, α≥0).</li></ul><p>Interestingly, we haven&#x27;t ruled out the human being anti-rational! The anti-rational human is one that desires the sword, but also wants to lie about it, but just spectacularly messes up its attempt at lying.</p><h2>Planning and multiple attempts</h2><p>We could allow the human to take actions that increase or decrease the probability of getting the sword. Then, if they tried to get the sword and then claimed they wanted it, we would conclude they were rational, using p. If they tried to avoid the sword and then claimed they wanted it, we could conclude they were anti-rational, using -p.</p><p>Of course, that makes two decisions, and we need to add alternative p&#x27;s, which are differently rational/anti-rational with respect to &quot;getting the sword&quot; and &quot;expressing preferences&quot;.</p><p>But those p&#x27;s are more complex, and we can now finally start to make use of the simplicity prior - especially if we repeat variants of the experiment multiple times. Then if the human is taken to be always correct in their expression of regret (our assumption), and if their actions are consistently in line with their stated values (observation), we can conclude they are most likely rational. Victory?</p><h2>Is the regret normative assumption correct?</h2><p>Normative assumptions are not intrinsically correct or incorrect, as they cannot be deduced from observation. The question is, instead, do they give a good definition of human reward, according to our judgment.</p><p>And the answer is... kinda?</p><p>First of all, it depends on context. Is the person speaking privately? Are they speaking to a beloved but formal relative who has just given them the present? Are they actually talking about that gift rather than another?</p><p>It&#x27;s clear that we cannot say for sure, just because the human expresses regret following a iPhone gift, that this is a correct description of their reward function. It depends, in a complicated way, on the context.</p><p>But &quot;depending on the context&quot; destroys the work of the simplicity prior in the previous paragraph. Unless we have a complicated description of when the regret assumption applies, we fall back into <a href=""https://www.lesserwrong.com/posts/SGHsnG7ZraTPKzveo/bias-in-rationality-is-much-worse-than-noise"">the difficulty of distinguishing</a> complex noise and biases, from actual values.</p><p>It&#x27;s not completely hopeless - the assumption that stated regret is <em>often</em> correct does do some work, combined with a simplicity prior. But to get the most out of it, we need a much more advanced understanding of regret.</p><p>We also need to balance this with other normative assumptions, lest we simply create a regret-minimiser.</p><h2>Meta versus feeling</h2><p>One way of figuring out how regret works is to ask people meta-questions - is the regret that you/they expressed in this situation likely to be genuine? How about that situation? If we make the normative assumption that the answers to these meta-questions are correct, we will get a more complicated understanding of regret, which will start reducing the space of (p, R) that we need to consider.</p><p>Another approach might be to look at the brain and body correlates of genuine regret. I elided the distinction between these approaches by referring to &quot;feelings and expressions of regret&quot;, but I&#x27;ll return to this distinction in a later post.</p>",Stuart_Armstrong,stuart_armstrong,Stuart_Armstrong,

<p>Migrating my <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/lt6/newish_ai_control_ideas/"">old post</a> over from Less Wrong.</p>
<p>I recently went on a two day intense solitary ""AI control retreat"", with the aim of generating new ideas for making safe AI. The ""retreat"" format wasn't really a success (""focused uninterrupted thought"" was the main gain, not ""two days of solitude"" - it would have been more effective in three hour sessions), but I did manage to generate a lot of new ideas. These ideas will now go before the baying bloodthirsty audience (that's you, folks) to test them for viability.</p>
<p>A central thread running through could be: <strong>if you want something, you have to define it, then code it, rather than assuming you can get if for free through some other approach.</strong></p>
<p>To provide inspiration and direction to my thought process, I first listed all the easy responses that we generally give to most proposals for AI control. If someone comes up with a new/old brilliant idea for AI control, it can normally be dismissed by appealing to one of these responses:</p>
<p>@. The AI is much smarter than us.
@. It’s not well defined.
@. The setup can be hacked.</p>
<ul>
<li>By the agent.</li>
<li>By outsiders, including other AI.</li>
<li>Adding restrictions encourages the AI to hack them, not obey them.
@. The agent will resist changes.
@. Humans can be manipulated, hacked, or seduced.
@. The design is not stable.</li>
<li>Under self-modification.</li>
<li>Under subagent creation.</li>
<li>Unrestricted search is dangerous.
@. The agent has, or will develop, dangerous goals.</li>
</ul>

<p>I decided to try and attack as many of these ideas as I could, head on, and see if there was any way of turning these objections. A key concept is that we should never just expect a system to behave ""nicely"" by default (see eg here). If we wanted that, we should define what ""nicely"" is, and put that in by hand.</p>
<p>I came up with sixteen main ideas, of varying usefulness and quality, which I will be posting in the coming weekdays in comments (the following links will go live after each post). The ones I feel most important (or most developed) are:</p>

Most &quot;radical skepticism&quot; arguments - Descartes&#x27;s Demon, various no-free-lunch theorems, Boltzmann Brains - generally turn out to be irrelevant, in practice, one way or another.</p><p>But the human preferences are in a different category. For a start, it&#x27;s clear that getting them correct is important for AI alignement - we can&#x27;t just ignore errors. But most importantly, simplicity priors/<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity"">Kolmogorov complexity</a>/Occam&#x27;s <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor"">razor</a> don&#x27;t help with learning human preferences, as illustrated most compactly with the the <a href=""https://www.lesserwrong.com/posts/rtphbZbMHTLCepd6d/humans-can-be-assigned-any-values-whatsoever"">substitution</a> of (-p,-R) for (p,R).</p><p>But this still feels like a bit of a trick. Maybe we can just assume rationality plus a bit of noise, or rationality most of the time, and get something a lot more reasonable.</p><h2>Structured noise has to be explained</h2><p>And, indeed, if humans were rational plus a bit of noise, things would be simple. A noisy signal has high Kolmogorov complexity, but there <a href=""https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~fortnow/papers/soph.pdf"">are ways</a> to treat noise as being of low complexity.</p><p>The problem with that approach is that explaining noise is completely different from explaining the highly structured noise that we know as bias.</p><p>Take the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring"">anchoring bias</a>, for example. In one of the <a href=""http://web.mit.edu/ariely/www/MIT/Chapters/CA.pdf"">classical experiments</a>, American students were asked if they would buy a product for the price that was the last two digits of their social security number, and were then asked what price they would buy the product for. The irrelevant last two digits had a strong distorting effect on their willingness to pay.</p><h2>Modelling anchoring behaviour</h2><p>Let&#x27;s model a simplified human, if not asked about their social security number, as valuing a cordless keyboard at $25, plus noise η drawn from a normal distribution of mean $0 and standard deviation $5.</p><p>If they are first asked about their social secuity number s, their valuation shifts to 3/4($25) + 1/4(s) + η.</p><p>To explain human values, we have two theories about their rewards:</p><ul><li>R(0)=$25.</li><li>R(1)=3/4($25) + 1/4(s).</li></ul><p>We have three theories about their planning rationality:</p><ul><li>p(0): the human is rational.</li><li>p(1): p(0) + noise η.</li><li>p(2): the human is rational, but has an anchoring bias of 1/4 of the value of the number they hear.</li><li>p(3): p(2) + noise η.</li></ul><p>If we count noise as being of low complexity, then R(0), p(0), and p(1) are low complexity rewards/planners. R(1), p(2), and p(3) are higher complexity.</p><p>If we run the experiment multiple times, it&#x27;s easy to realise that p(0) is incompatible with observations, as is p(2) - there genuinely is noise in the human response. All the other pairs are possible (after all, noise could explain any behaviour on the  part of the human). Since (p(1), R(0)) is the lowest complexity pair, can we not just conclude that the human has genuine preferences with some noise and bias?</p><p>Unfortunately, no.</p><p>(p(1), R(0)) is the lowest complexity pair, yes, but the agent&#x27;s behaviour becomes more and more improbable under that assumption. As we sample more and more, (p(3), R(0)) and (p(1), R(1)) become more probable, as they fit the data much better; the deviation between the unbiased mean of $25 and the sample mean (which converges to 1/4($50)+3/4($25)= $31.25) becomes more and more inexplicable as the number of datapoints rises:</p><span><figure><img src=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/rb5yziyatz00lc4/anchoring.png?raw=1"" class=""draft-image "" style=""width:97%"" /></figure></span><p>Now, (p(3), R(0)) is the &quot;true&quot; pair - an anchoring-biased planner and a simpler reward. Yay! But (p(1), R(1)) fits the data just as well: a simple planner and a strange reward. They are of basically equal complexity, so we have no way of distinguishing them.</p><p>The probem is that bias is a highly structured deviation from rationality, and can only be explained by complex structured noise. The models with simple noise get ruled out because they don&#x27;t fit the data, and models with structured noise are no simpler than models with complex preferences.</p><p>(You might argue for imposing a stronger complexity prior on the planner p than the reward R, but in that case you have to somehow solve situations where people have genuinely complex preferences, such as cooking, music, and similar).</p><p>There is no easy way to get around the radical skepticism on the values of non-rational agents - but there are ways, which I will post soon.</p>",Stuart_Armstrong,stuart_armstrong,Stuart_Armstrong,

And who won the 1986 World Cup <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina_v_England_(1986_FIFA_World_Cup)"">football match between England and Argentina</a>? And what do these questions have to do with learning human values?</p><h2>Underlying true reality?</h2><p>Both those top questions are uncertain. We haven&#x27;t scanned the solar system with enough precision to find any such teapot. And though the referee allowed the first Argentine goal, making it official, and though FIFA had Agentina progress to the semi-finales (they would eventually win the tournament) while England was eliminate... that goal, the &quot;Hand of God&quot; goal, <a href=""https://football-40ba.kxcdn.com/images/image/hand-of-god-goal-maradona.jpg"">was scored by Maradona with his hand</a>, a totally illegal move.</p><p>In a sense, neither question can ever be fully resolved. Even if we fully sweep the the solar system for teapots in a century&#x27;s time, it&#x27;s still possible there might have been one now, and it then crashed into the sun, stopping us from ever finding it. And in the spirit of <a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/05/05/ambijectivity/"">ambijectivity</a>, the question of Argentina&#x27;s victory (or whether it was a &quot;proper&quot; victory, or a &quot;fair&quot; victory) depends on which aspect of the definition of victory you choose to emphasise - the referee&#x27;s call and the official verdict, versus the clear violation of the rules.</p><p>Nevertheless, there is a sense in which we feel the first question has a definite answer (which is almost certainly &quot;no&quot;), while the second is purely about <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/np/disputing_definitions/"">definitions</a>.</p><h2>Answering the question</h2><p>Why do we feel that the teapot question has a definite answer? Well, we have a model of reality as something that actually objectively exists, and our investigation of the world backs it up - when confronted by a door, we feel that there is something behind the door, even if we choose not to open it. There are various counterfactuals in which we could have sent out a probe to any given area of the orbit, so we feel we could have resolved the &quot;is there a teapot at this location&quot; for any given location within a wide radius of the Earth.</p><p>Basically, the universe has features that causes us to believe that when we observe it (quantum effects aside), we are seeing a previous reality rather than creating a new one (see the old <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2YfEXOwpz0"">debate between platonists and formalists in mathematics</a>).</p><p>Whereas even if we had a God or an AI, we don&#x27;t expect it to have a definite answer to the question of who won that football match. There is no platonic underlying reality as to the winner of the game, that we could just figure out if we had enough knowledge. We already know everything that&#x27;s relevant.</p><h2>Procedure for learning/defining human values</h2><p>Many attempts at <a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.03137.pdf"">learning human values</a> are framed as &quot;humans have an underlying true reward R, and here is procedure P for determining it&quot;.</p><p>But in most cases, that formulation is incorrect, because the paper is actually saying &quot;here is a procedure P for determining human values&quot;. Actually saying that humans have true rewards is a much more complicated process: you have to justify that the true R exists, like Russell&#x27;s teapot, rather than being a question of definition, like Argentina&#x27;s football victory.</p><p>That sounds like a meaningless distinction: what is, in practice, the difference between a true reward R and an imperfect estimator P, and just P? It&#x27;s simpler conceptually if we talk about the true R, so why not do so?</p><p>It&#x27;s simpler, but much more misleading. If you work under the assumption that there is a true R, then you&#x27;re less likely to think that P might lead you astray. And if you see imperfections in P, your first instinct is something like &quot;make P more rational/more likely to converge on R&quot;, rather than ask the true question, which is &quot;is P a good definition of human values?&quot;</p><p>Even if the <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-realism/"">moral realists</a> are right, and there is a true R, thinking about it is still misleading. Because there is, as yet, no satisfactory definition of this true R, and it&#x27;s very hard to make something converge better onto something you haven&#x27;t defined. Shifting the focus from the unknown (and maybe unknowable, or maybe even non-existent) R, to the actual P, is important.</p><p>It&#x27;s because I was focused so strongly on the procedure P, treating R as non-existent, that I was able to find <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1099"">some</a> of the <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1101"">problems</a> with value learning algorithms.</p><p>When you think that way, it becomes natural to ponder issues like &quot;if we define victory through the official result, this leaves open the possibility for referee-concealed rule-breaking; is this acceptable for whatever we need that definition for?&quot;</p>",Stuart_Armstrong,stuart_armstrong,Stuart_Armstrong,

x2wn2MWYSafDtm8Lf,	Mixed-Strategy Ratifiability Implies CDT=EDT,mixed-strategy-ratifiability-implies-cdt-edt-1,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/x2wn2MWYSafDtm8Lf/mixed-strategy-ratifiability-implies-cdt-edt-1,2017-10-31T05:56:05.395Z,12,8,2,False,False,,"<p><em>(<a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1690"">Cross-posted from IAFF</a>.)</em></p><p>I provide conditions under which CDT=EDT in Bayes-net causal models.</p><p><a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1629"">Previously</a>, I discussed conditions under which LICDT=LIEDT. That case was fairly difficult to analyse, although it looks fairly difficult to get LICDT and LIEDT to differ. It’s much easier to analyze the case of CDT and EDT ignoring logical uncertainty.</p><p>As I argued in that post, it seems to me that a lot of informal reasoning about the differences between CDT and EDT doesn’t actually give the same problem representation to both decision theories. One can easily imagine handing a causal model to CDT and a joint probability distribution to EDT, without checking that the probability distribution could possibly be consistent with the causal model. Representing problems in Bayes nets seems like a good choice for comparing the behavior of CDT and EDT. CDT takes the network to encode causal information, while EDT ignores that and just uses the probability distribution encoded by the network.</p><p>It’s easy to see that CDT=EDT if all the causal parents of an agent’s decision are observed. CDT makes decisions by first cutting the links to parents, and then conditioning on alternative actions. EDT conditions on the alternatives without cutting links. So, EDT differs from CDT insofar as actions provide evidence about causal parents. If all parents are known, then it’s not possible for CDT and EDT to differ.</p><p>So, any argument for CDT over EDT or vice versa must rely on the possibility of unobserved parents.</p><p>The most obvious parents to any decision node are the observations themselves. These are, of course, observed. But, it’s possible that there are other significant causal parents which can’t be observed so easily. For example, to recover the usual results in the classical thought experiments, it’s common to add a node representing “the agent’s abstract algorithm” which is a parent to the agent and any simulations of the agent. This abstract algorithm node captures the correlation which allows EDT to cooperate in the prisoner’s dilemma and one-box in Newcomb, for example.</p><p>Here, I argue that sufficient introspection still implies that CDT=EDT. Essentially, the agent may not have direct access to all its causal parents, but if it has enough self-knowledge (unlike the setup in <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1525"">Smoking Lesion Steelman</a>), the same screening-off phenomenon occurs. This is somewhat like saying that the output of the abstract algorithm node is known. Under this condition, EDT and CDT both two-box in Newcomb and defect in the prisoner’s dilemma.</p><h2>Case 1: Mixed-Strategy Ratifiability</h2><p>Suppose that CDT and EDT agents are given the same decision problem in the form of a Bayesian network. Actions are represented by a variable node in the network, <em><strong>A</strong></em>, with values <em><strong>a</strong></em>. Agents select mixed strategies somehow, under the constraint that their choice is maximal with respect to the expectations which they compute for their actions; IE:</p><ol type=""1""><li>(<em>EDT maximization constraint.</em>) The EDT agent must choose a mixed strategy in which <em><strong>P(a)&gt;ϵ</strong></em> only if the action is among those which maximize expected utility.</li><li>(<em>CDT maximization constraint.</em>) The CDT agent is under the same restriction, but with respect to the causal expectation.</li></ol><p>(<em>Exploration constraint.</em>) I further restrict all action probabilities to be at <em>least</em> epsilon, to ensure that the conditional expectations are well-defined.</p><p>(<em>Ratifiability constraint.</em>) I’ll also assume ratifiability of mixed strategies: the belief state from which CDT and EDT make their decision is one in which they know which mixed strategy they select. Put another way, the decision is required to be stable under knowledge of the decision. I discuss ratifiability more <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1663"">here</a>.</p><p>We can imagine the agent getting this kind of self-knowledge in several ways. Perhaps it knows its own source code and can reason about what it would do in situations like this. Perhaps it knows “how these things go” from experience. Or perhaps the decision rule which picks out the mixed strategies explicitly looks for a choice consistent with mixed-strategy ratifiability.</p><p>How this gets represented in the Bayes net is by a node representing the selection of mixed strategy, which I’ll call <em><strong>D</strong></em> (the “decision” node) which is the direct parent of <em><strong>A</strong></em> (our action node). <em><strong>D</strong></em> gives the probability of <em><strong>A</strong></em>.</p><p>(<em>Mixed-strategy implementability.</em>) I also assume that <em><strong>A </strong></em>has no other direct parents, representing the assumption that the choice of mixed strategy is the <em>only</em> thing determining the action. This is like the assumption that the environment doesn’t contain anything which correlates itself with our random number generator to mess with our experimentation, which I discussed in the <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1629"">LICDT=LIEDT conditions</a> post. It’s allowable for things to be correlated with our randomness, but if so, they must be <em>downstream</em> of it. Hence, it’s also a form of my “law of logical causality” from <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1663"">earlier</a>.</p><p><strong>Theorem 1.</strong> Under the above assumptions, the consistent choices of mixed strategy are the same for CDT and EDT.</p><p><em>Proof.</em> The CDT and EDT expected utility calculations become the same under the mixed-strategy ratifiability condition, since <em><strong>D</strong></em> screens <em><strong>A</strong></em> off from any un-observed parents of <em><strong>D</strong></em>. Besides that, all the rest of the constraints are already the same for CDT and EDT. So, the consistent choices of mixed strategies will be the same. ◻</p><p>It’s natural to think of these possible choices as equilibria in the game-theoretic sense. My constraints on the decision procedures for EDT and CDT don’t force any particular choice of mixed strategy in cases where several options have maximal utility; but, the condition that that choice must be self-consistent forces it into a few possibilities.</p><p>The important observation for my purposes is that this argument for CDT=EDT doesn’t require any introspection beyond knowing which mixed strategy you’re going to choose in the situation you’re in. Perhaps this still seems like a lot to assume. I would contend that it’s easier than you may think. As we saw in the logical inductor post, it just seems to happen naturally for LIDT agents. It would also seem to happen for agents who can reason about themselves, or simply know themselves well enough due to experience.</p><p>Furthermore, the ratifiability constraint is something which CDTers have argued for independent reasons, to fix problems which otherwise arise for CDT. So denial of this assumption seems to be an unavailable response for CDTers.</p><p>The way I’ve defined CDT and EDT may seem a bit unnatural, since I’ve constrained them based on max-expectation choice of <em>actions</em>, but stated that they are choosing <em>mixed strategies</em>. Shouldn’t I be selecting from the possible probability distributions on actions, based on the expected utility of those? This would invalidate my conclusion, since the CDT expectation of different choices of <em><strong>D</strong></em> can differ from the EDT expectation. But, it is impossible to enforce ratifiability while also ensuring that conditioning on different choices of <em><strong>D</strong></em> is well-defined. So, I think this way of doing it is the natural way when a ratifiability constraint is in play.[1]</p><h2>Case 2: Approximate Ratifiability</h2><p>More concerning, perhaps, is the way my argument takes under-specified decision procedures (only giving constraints under which a decision procedure is fit to be called CDT or EDT) and concludes a thing about what happens in the under-specified cases (effectively, any necessary tie-breaking between actions with equal expected utility must choose action probabilities consistent with the agent’s beliefs about the probabilities of its actions). Wouldn’t the argument just be invalid if we started with fully-specified versions of CDT and EDT, which already use some particular tie-breaking procedure? Shouldn’t we, then, take this as an argument against ratifiability as opposed to an argument for CDT=EDT?</p><p>Certainly the conclusion doesn’t follow without the assumption of ratifiability. I can address the concern to some extent, however, by making a version of the argument for fixed (but continuous) decision procedures under an approximate ratifiability condition. This will also get rid of the (perhaps annoying) exploration constraint.</p><p>(<em>Continuous EDT</em>) The EDT agent chooses mixed strategies according to some fixed way which is a continuous function of the belief-state (regarded as a function from worlds to probabilities). This function (the “selection function”) is required to agree with maximum-expected-utility choices when the expectations are well-defined and the differences in utilities between options are greater than some <em><strong>ϵ&gt;0</strong></em>.</p><p>(<em>Continuous CDT</em>) The same, but taking CDT-style expectations.</p><p>(<em>Approximate Ratifiability</em>) Let the true mixed strategy which will be chosen by the agent’s decision rule be <em><strong>d∗</strong></em>. For any other <em><strong>d∈D</strong></em> such that <em><strong>|ln(d(a))−ln(d∗(a)))|&gt;ϵ</strong></em> for any <em><strong>a∈A</strong></em>, we have <em><strong>P(D=d)=0</strong></em>.</p><p>(We still assume mixed-strategy implementability, too.)</p><p>Approximate ratifiability doesn’t perfectly block evidence from flowing backward from the action to the parents of the decision, like perfect ratifiability did. It does bound the amount of evidence, though: since the alternate <em><strong>d</strong></em> must be very close to <em><strong>d∗</strong></em>, the likelihood ratio cannot be large. Now, as we make epsilon arbitrarily small, there is some delta which bounds the differences in action utilities assigned by CDT and EDT which gets arbitrarily small as well. Hence, the EDT and CDT selection functions must agree on more and more.</p><p>By Brouwer’s fixed-point theorem, there will be equilibria for the CDT and EDT selection functions. Although there’s no guarantee these equilibria are close to each other the way I’ve spelled things out, we could construct selection functions for both CDT and EDT which get within epsilon of any of the equilibria from theorem 1.</p><h2>Case 3: Abandoning Mixed Strategies</h2><p>There's one more objection I'd like to deal with. Mixed-strategy implementability is required for both arguments above. It might be claimed that this smuggles CDT-like reasoning into EDT. </p><p>Informally, I would argue that if mixed-strategy implementability fails, then CDT will learn the wrong causal network. A failure of mixed-strategy implementability basically says that we cannot perform independent experiments. What we thought was a random choice was actually influenced by something. It seems plausible that CDT agents will have constructed incorrect causal networks in such a world, where the extra parents of <em><strong>A</strong></em> are mistakenly treated as children.</p><p>To put it a different way: mixed-strategy implementability might be a feature of causal networks that agents can form by their own experimentation in the world. In that case, considering thought experiments where the assumption fails would not be relevant to actual performance of decision procedures.</p><p>However, this reply is not very strong. The truth is that ""mixed strategies"" are an ontological artifact: you actually take one action or another. Only some agent-architectures will first choose a mixed strategy and then randomize according to the chosen probabilities. Even if so, mixed-strategy implementability implies an absurd degree of trust in that randomization.</p><p>So to address the problem formally, we replace ""mixed strategies"" with <em>the agent's own estimate of its action probabilities</em>.</p><p>For example, consider rock-paper-scissors between Alice and Bob, who are ""reasonably"" good at predicting each other. If Alice can predict her own choice at any point, she is concerned that Bob will pick up on the same pattern and predict her. Suppose that Alice decides to play Rock. She will become concerned that Bob has predicted this, and will play Paper. So Alice will shift to play Scissors. And so on. This process will iterate until it is too late to change decisions.</p><p>In other words, ""mixed strategies"" can emerge naturally from following incentives against predictability. The agent just takes whichever action has the highest expected utility; but in doing so, the agent pushes its own beliefs away from certainty, since if it were certain that it would take some specific action, then a different action would look more appealing.</p><p>This idea can be formalized by representing everything with Bayesian networks, as before, but now we make the <em><strong>D🡒A</strong></em> link <em>deterministic;</em> the decision procedure of the agent <em>completely</em> determines the action from the beliefs of the agent. <em><strong>D</strong></em> should now be thought of as <em>the agents beliefs about which action it will take,</em> and nothing else -- so what we're doing here is saying that given a belief about its own action probabilities, the agent has some decision it makes. This link is also assumed to be <em>rational</em> (choosing the maximum-expectation action, by either the CDT notion of expectation, or the EDT notion). </p><p>(Since we're back to discontinuous functions, we can no longer magic away the division-by-zero problem by invoking continuity, like in the previous section; but we can do other things, which I'll leave to reader imagination for now.)</p><p>However, the agent's self-knowledge must be approximate: the agent's probabilities about <em><strong>D</strong></em> are zero outside some epsilon of its true distribution on <em><strong>A</strong></em> at the time of making its decision. (If we required perfection, Alice might get stuck in an infinite loop when trying to play rock-paper-scissors with Bob.)</p><p>We now make a similar argument as before: our approximate knowledge of <em><strong>D</strong></em> screens off any correlations between <em><strong>A</strong></em> and parents of <em><strong>D,</strong></em> as epsilon shrinks to zero. Notably, this requires that the relationship between <em><strong>D</strong></em> and its parents is continuous, since the screen-off phenomenon might not occur if the uncertainty is shrinking to zero around a discontinuity.</p><h2>Consequences for Counterfactuals</h2><p>The arguments above are fairly rudimentary. The point I’m trying to drive at is more radical: there is basically one notion of counterfactual available. It is the one which both CDT and EDT arrive at, if they have very much introspection. It isn’t particularly good for the kinds of decision-theory problems we’d like to solve: it tends to two-box in realistic Newcomb’s problems (where the predictor is imperfect), defect in prisoner’s dilemma, et cetera. My conclusion is that these are not problems to try and solve by counterfactual reasoning. They are problems to solve with updateless reasoning, bargaining, <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1468"">cooperative oracles</a>, <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1683"">predictable exploration</a>, and so on.</p><p>I don’t think any of this is very new in terms of the arguments between CDT and EDT in the literature. Philosophers seem to have a fairly good understanding of how CDT equals EDT when introspection is possible; see SEP on <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/decision-causal/#Obje"">objections to CDT</a>. The proofs above are just versions of the tickle defense for EDT. However, I think the AI alignment community may not be so aware of the extent to which EDT and CDT coincide. Philosophers continue to distinguish between EDT and CDT, while knowing that they wouldn’t differ for ideal introspective agents, on the grounds that decision theories should provide notions of rationality even under failure of introspection. It’s worth asking whether advanced AIs may still have some fundamental introspection barriers which lead to different results for CDT and EDT. From where we stand now, looking at positive introspection results over the years, from <a href=""http://intelligence.org/files/DefinabilityTruthDraft.pdf"">probabilistic truth</a> to <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.04145"">reflective oracles</a> to <a href=""https://intelligence.org/2016/09/12/new-paper-logical-induction/"">logical induction</a>, I think the answer is no.</p><p>It’s possible that a solution to AI alignment will be some kind of tool AI, designed to be highly intelligent in a restricted domain but incapable of thinking about other agent, including itself, on a strategic level. Perhaps there is a useful distinction between CDT and EDT in that case. Yet, such an AI hardly seems to need a decision theory at all, much less the kind of reflective decision theory which MIRI tends to think about.</p><p>The meagre reasons in the post above hardly seem to suffice to support this broad view, however. Perhaps my Smoking Lesion Steelman series gives some intuition for it (<a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1525"">I</a>, <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1662"">II</a>, <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1663"">III</a>). Perhaps I’ll be able to make more of a case as time goes on.</p><p>[1]: Really, I think the reasoning in this paragraph is much too fast, but there's a lot to be said on the subject and it would overcomplicate this post.</p>",abramdemski,abramdemski,abramdemski,

I keep undershooting my 2% inflation target!</p><p><strong>A.</strong> It sounds like you need to create more money.</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> I tried that, and it didn&#x27;t work!</p><p><strong>A.</strong> How much money did you create?</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> Five dollars.</p><p><strong>A.</strong> Okay, now we know that five dollars wasn&#x27;t enough money. You need to create more.</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> More than five dollars?</p><p><strong>A.</strong> Right.</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> I&#x27;ve heard that it&#x27;s very bad when governments create lots of money just so they can buy things. Prices skyrocket, and soon nobody wants to hold on to the money anymore! That&#x27;s why we have stern and independent central banks, to prevent too much money from being created.</p><p><strong>A.</strong> Yes, that&#x27;s a big problem, all right! That problem is the opposite of the problem you actually have. It&#x27;s definitely true that if prices start going up faster than you want, you should stop creating money and maybe destroy some of the money you already made. But that is not the problem you have right now. Your current problem is that there&#x27;s too little money flowing through the economy, meaning, not enough money to drive all the buying of real goods and labor that could be exchanged if your economy had more money.</p><p>You know how hyperinflation happens because there isn&#x27;t enough real stuff and so the tons of new money are just competing with other money to buy a limited amount of real stuff? One way of looking at your 2% inflation target is that you&#x27;re supposed to create just enough money flow that it&#x27;s a little above what&#x27;s required to animate all the trades your economy can make. If there&#x27;s a little more money flow than the minimum required to animate all potential trades, that money is competing just a little with other money to buy stuff. Producing, say, around 2% inflation. That&#x27;s why your government gave you an inflation target that was low, but not super-low and not zero. Right now your economy doesn&#x27;t have that much inflation, because there isn&#x27;t enough money flowing and your economy is failing to make all the trades it could make. That&#x27;s why &#x27;undershooting your inflation target&#x27; is associated with a country that feels sad and listless, with all the factories and shops still there but people not having enough money to buy things from them, because not enough customers are buying from their own enterprises. It&#x27;s very depressing.</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> Can I solve that problem by being a stern, independent central bank that refuses to create more money?</p><p><strong>A.</strong> No.</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> How about if I sit down to lunch with some big banks and ask them to make more loans, maybe accompanied by a significant look where I have one eyebrow raised?</p><p>A. Even if they listened, I&#x27;d worry that everything in your economy is currently in equilibrium and other banks might make fewer loans once there were fewer loan opportunities left. Anyway—I&#x27;m just guessing here—did you maybe already try that?</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>A.</strong> And what happened?</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> It didn&#x27;t work. But that doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t work next time!</p><p><strong>A.</strong> Your economy, and the people in your economy, are suffering right now. You should be creating more money right away, not letting innocent people suffer while you experiment with weird alternatives to action.</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> But I don&#x27;t want to create more money!</p><p><strong>A.</strong> Then you won&#x27;t get more inflation. If you want more inflation, you need to create more money.</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> But I already printed five whole dollars and prices didn&#x27;t go up at all! They actually fell! I&#x27;m starting to wonder if printing money really makes prices go up.</p><p><strong>A.</strong> There were probably some banks exploding at the same time you were printing the five dollars, and the exploding banks destroyed more than five dollars. Even though you&#x27;re the only entity that&#x27;s allowed to create your country&#x27;s base money, banks also create a kind of virtual money when they make loans. This means that when a bank explodes, it can destroy some virtual money. So even though you printed five dollars, the bank exploding at the same time destroyed more than five dollars of virtual money, and the total amount of money went down. That might be why prices didn&#x27;t rise. Or it might be more subtle, like people wanting to hang onto the money they already have. That also decreases the speed at which money changes hands, which means that there&#x27;s less effective money per transaction in the total economy, which puts downward pressure on the price of each transaction.</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> So there&#x27;s nothing I can do? That&#x27;s terrible! But I guess if there&#x27;s nothing I can do, it&#x27;s not my fault—</p><p><strong>A.</strong> No, you can do something! You just need to create even more money.</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> (<em>Grudging sigh.</em>) How much more money do you think might be enough?</p><p><strong>A.</strong> Well, predicting that is a very difficult job! There are all sorts of things that affect prices besides the amount of base money, like bank lending rates. Now, all these other factors merely affect the amount of base money that&#x27;s &quot;enough&quot;, they don&#x27;t mean that you could print infinite money without increasing prices. Ideally, you&#x27;d create a prediction market to forecast the effects of printing different amounts of money. But if you create some money and prices don&#x27;t increase, that definitely means you didn&#x27;t print enough.</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> What if I print enough money to make prices rise, and they still don&#x27;t rise?</p><p><strong>A.</strong> Then you were wrong about how much money was &#x27;enough&#x27;.</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> That seems unlikely. Maybe I&#x27;m already doing the right thing, and it&#x27;s just going to take a while to work, so I don&#x27;t need to change anything?</p><p><strong>A.</strong> Sorry, but that&#x27;s a definite no! The weak form of the efficient markets hypothesis says you can&#x27;t have publicly predictable price changes in a liquid market. If the price of your currency was predictably going to drop later, people would short-sell it now, or just refuse to buy it at a price that would predictably go lower. So if what you&#x27;re currently doing, and any future actions you&#x27;ve already announced, aren&#x27;t already making prices higher, we already know it wasn&#x27;t enough. You can also check and see if the market is pricing inflation-adjusted securities in a way that shows the market expects inflation over the next few years. If they don&#x27;t, you&#x27;re doing something wrong.</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> But my expert economists say that the people who price inflation-adjusted assets are wrong, and there will be lots of inflation next year! In fact, I&#x27;m already starting to think about raising rates now to prevent that, like a stern and independent central bank should.</p><p><strong>A.</strong> Is it possibly the case that your in-house experts have been wrong every single time they predicted more inflation than the market forecast, over the last fifteen years or so?</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> Yes, but that doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;ll be wrong this year!</p><p><strong>A.</strong> I&#x27;m sorry, but it sounds to me like your experts just don&#x27;t have the incentives to make correct forecasts. Or maybe they lack the sheer knowledge and computational power to make better forecasts than the hedge-fund managers who can make billions and billions and billions of dollars if they predict 1% better than the market. Although… I have to say, your in-house experts being wrong in the same direction every year doesn&#x27;t sound quite so innocent.</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> But… my in-house experts have expensive suits! And credentials! Hedge-fund managers don&#x27;t have suits that nice, I bet.</p><p><strong>A.</strong> Actually, they kind of do. More importantly, they&#x27;re paid literally billions of dollars to get the answer right. Maybe your in-house experts are telling you what they think you want to hear. Maybe they&#x27;re just making the same innocent mistake repeatedly. But if you&#x27;ve already seen your in-house experts be wrong lots of times before, and they&#x27;re mistaken in the same direction every time, then you need to stop listening to your in-house experts when they predict lots of happy inflation. You should pay attention to the market forecasts instead, because highly liquid market prices almost never change in a predictable net direction. When liquid prices change in a predictable net direction, it corresponds to free money! Lots of highly intelligent organisms in your financial ecology really like to eat free energy, and when they consume the free energy it eliminates the directional error. Which usually means liquid markets aren&#x27;t repeatedly wrong in the same direction, like your in-house experts are. Right now, the market forecast is telling you that you need to create more money if you want inflation.</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> It does seem clear that I should lower rates to nearly zero at my meeting next month. That&#x27;s creating more money, right?</p><p><strong>A.</strong> Sorry, let me rephrase. The market has already guessed that you plan to lower rates at your meeting next month. If the market rate for inflation-adjusted securities doesn&#x27;t already imply that they expect inflation, it means they already don&#x27;t expect you to create enough money. If the market doesn&#x27;t already expect inflation, you need to create more money than they&#x27;re currently expecting you to create. If you&#x27;re worried about a self-referential circularity if you did start paying attention to the market forecast and the market realized that, you can just create a separate prediction market to directly forecast the amount of money you&#x27;ll need. But right now, when you&#x27;re not paying attention to the market forecast, the situation is clear—the market expects your current behavior and comfortable habits to fail, and you need to do more.</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> But I can&#x27;t lower interest rates below zero!</p><p><strong>A.</strong> First of all, yes you can, several countries are trying it and nothing bad is happening to them. And second, you can always create money. Create new ones and zeroes and inject them into the economy. Never mind thinking about interest rates. If you create enough money, prices will go up.</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> What if I say I&#x27;ll print ten dollars and the market still thinks that&#x27;s not enough?</p><p><strong>A.</strong> Create even more money. Look, imagine creating a quadrillion dollars. Prices would go up then, right? I mean, a 12-year-old raised by goldbugs could understand that part… uh, it&#x27;s possible you might need to add a 12-year-old raised by goldbugs to your advisory staff.</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> Just because creating enough money would make prices rise, doesn&#x27;t logically imply that if prices don&#x27;t rise then I haven&#x27;t created enough money!</p><p><strong>A.</strong> Actually—</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> Really honestly, I already created a large amount of base money! I&#x27;m not lying, I really made a lot! Doesn&#x27;t that mean I&#x27;m already being super-loose with my policy? I just can&#x27;t understand how, with my base money supply at a level of over nine dollars, you think my monetary policy is too tight.</p><p><strong>A.</strong> The absolute amount of base money has no meaning apart from monetary velocity. 1 trillion base dollars and a bank-lending multiplier of 33 is more effective money than 6 trillion base dollars and a bank-lending multipler of 4. That&#x27;s why central banking isn&#x27;t as simple as just increasing the base money supply by 2% per year, or something like that. In fact, there are positive feedback cycles which means that targeting a base money level can produce wild instability. When money is becoming more valuable, people try to hold onto it more, which slows down velocity, which decreases the effective amount of money available per transaction, which decreases prices even more, which makes money even more valuable. Which increases the real burden of debt, which means that fewer people pay back their loans successfully, which blows up banks and makes them more reluctant to lend, which futher decreases the money supply, which further decreases the money available to pay back debt. So as a central bank, you need to keep your eye on the amount of money being spent and moving around, not the amount of base money that exists. If the amount of money spent and moving around is going down, or just increasing slower than it used to, you&#x27;re in trouble. And you need to do something right away, because of positive feedback cycles!</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> I am doing something! My interest rates are super-low right now. People can take out loans super cheaply! Doesn&#x27;t that mean I&#x27;m already being super-loose with my policy in a way that&#x27;s just bound to create lots of inflation starting, you know, any minute now?</p><p><strong>A.</strong> Nope! Think about Freedonia, which is printing too much money and has 100% per year inflation. Would ten percent interest rates be &#x27;tight money&#x27; there?</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> Ten percent interest? That&#x27;s super-high!</p><p><strong>A.</strong> Not in Freedonia! In Freedonia, if you have a company that&#x27;s growing five percent real growth every year, plus one hundred percent inflation, that corresponds to 105% nominal growth. In a country like that, if you make a loan at ten percent nominal interest, it&#x27;s −90% real interest! Which is 95% below the rough vicinity of where we might find the Wicksellian interest rate! And that&#x27;s super-inflationary! Conversely, in Japan where there&#x27;s near-zero inflation and lots of saving and an aging population, the Wicksellian equilibrium interest rate is negative-something percent, so a nominal 1% percent interest rate might be a high rate of real interest that made for tight money and produced more deflation. That&#x27;s why central banking isn&#x27;t as easy as clamping the nominal interest rate at three percent and holding it there forever. In fact, if you clamp nominal interest at 3%, your currency will inevitably blow up into deflation or hyperinflation! Lower inflation makes a fixed nominal rate be tighter money which produces an even lower price level. Higher inflation makes a fixed nominal rate be a lower real rate which corresponds to even cheaper money. Nominal interest-rate targeting as a control instrument is kind of silly to begin with, honestly! It&#x27;s like trying to steer a car with a wobbling, unsteady steering wheel, where the same steering-wheel position might be pointing the road-wheels in a different direction every time the car goes another meter.</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> All this sounds very complicated. Can I take a long time to think about what&#x27;s going on, and maybe respond very timidly and weakly?</p><p><strong>A.</strong> No! When your currency is gaining value, it makes people more reluctant to spend the currency, which decreases the effectively available supply of the currency, which increases the price of the currency. When banks blow up and vaporize virtual money, or when banks become more reluctant to make loans, it decreases the money flow available to pay off all the loans in the system. When inflation goes lower, it increases the real interest rate represented by the nominal rate you target, which is tighter money, which puts further downward pressure on prices. These are positive feedback loops! You need to respond right away, before the positive feedback gets out of control. If you do nothing, the loops will blow up. If you do something, but too little, they&#x27;ll blow up slower. You need to do enough to interrupt the positive feedback cycle!</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> Like sharply raising interest rates to combat inflation, before people start trying to get rid of the money they&#x27;re holding and it turns into hyperinflation?</p><p><strong>A.</strong> Right! And if inflation was still spiraling out of control, you&#x27;d raise interest rates further and, more importantly, create less money or even destroy some money! You&#x27;d have to do that right away before things got even worse!</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> Exactly! I&#x27;d raise rates as soon as I saw inflation coming, I wouldn&#x27;t wait for it to happen. I&#x27;d be super-proactive!</p><p><strong>A.</strong> Well, you&#x27;d raise rates if the market said too much inflation was coming. You wouldn&#x27;t listen to your in-house experts who&#x27;ve been wrong in the same direction every single time.</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> I wouldn&#x27;t?</p><p><strong>A.</strong> Anyway, you know how you need to be super proactive and alert to prevent too much inflation? This is the same situation, only in reverse.</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> But… it&#x27;s just…</p><p><strong>A.</strong> What is it?</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> As a central bank raised in the modern era, I just feel deeply bad inside about inflation, you know? Even if I have to do it sometimes, it feels dirty.</p><p><strong>A.</strong> Yes, I&#x27;ve gathered that.</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> I mean, back in the day, there were bad people who created a lot of new money, and heroes who stopped them. Even though nobody believed in them, even though the world scorned them, even though lots of people were claiming that inflation had nothing to do with the money supply and was caused by labor unions or something, they still tightened monetary policy! I want to look in the mirror and see a hero, not a villain. Like the days of yore when Paul Volcker rode into battle against inflation with President Carter by his side like a loyal shieldbearer, and Carter nobly sacrificed himself so Volcker could go on…</p><p><strong>A.</strong> Those heroes were fighting a problem that is the opposite of your problem. They correctly did the opposite of the thing you need to do. Or, on a meta-level, they did the meta-thing you need to do—they showed courage and conviction, pointed in the right direction, even though some people were claiming that the central bank was powerless to help.</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> But what if I&#x27;m too courageous and then I overshoot my inflation target?</p><p><strong>A.</strong> Both lab experimentation and macroeconomic history shows that price-setters are much more reluctant to lower prices than raise prices. Employers and employees are much more reluctant to lower wages than to raise wages. Most employers would rather fire one person than try to negotiate 5% salary cuts with 20 people who would all be demoralized. On the other hand, if there&#x27;s enough nominal money coming in and the wage market is heating up, they&#x27;re often okay with giving everyone 5% raises. This means that making your money policy slightly too tight does much more damage than making it slightly too loose, because it&#x27;s a well-tested empirical fact that the people inside the economy have a much easier time adjusting to slightly higher money flow than slightly lower money flow.</p><p>Big deflation and big inflation both do enormous amounts of damage, and hyperinflation is worse because it goes further and faster. But money that&#x27;s a little too tight does much more damage than money that&#x27;s a little too loose! So it&#x27;s really important that you create more money right now, and don&#x27;t worry so much about the possibility of overshooting your inflation target a little, especially when you&#x27;ve undershot your target a lot up until now.</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> But with all these dangerous positive-feedback cycles… what if prices skyrocket? Just because printing a quadrillion dollars would create hyperinflation doesn&#x27;t mean that there&#x27;s a smaller amount of money I can print to cause exactly 2% inflation! There could be nonlinearities in the market.</p><p><strong>A.</strong> Indeed there are! So here&#x27;s what you do. Instead of literally printing cash, create electronic money in your own account that you then use to buy something else. Buy an asset you can sell back later, like government bonds. That way, you&#x27;re creating some new money now. But you keep the assets you buy with the new money. That way, you can sell back the asset later to destroy the money after velocity picks up, or if you accidentally created too much.</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> That sounds really wobbly to me. I&#x27;m afraid something will go wrong, and that price levels will end up going back and forth or maybe out of control.</p><p><strong>A.</strong> There are several tools you can use to prevent that! The most important tool is to target a price path. That means, instead of constantly trying to eyeball the economy and guessing in an ad-hoc way whether it has too much or too little money, you have a definite rule that says, &quot;If inflation goes over 2%/year then I will create less money and if inflation goes under 2%/year I will create more money, and the further over or under the level it goes, the more money I&#x27;ll destroy or create.&quot; And if people trust you&#x27;ll do that, they won&#x27;t expect inflation to go much over or under 2%/year, and they won&#x27;t value money any more or less than a long-run 2%/year level implies.</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> So every year I try for 2% inflation that year, and miss, and end up with 1% inflation instead, and then I do the same thing again next year? Sounds like a great policy to me! I&#x27;m already on the ball when it comes to that one!</p><p><strong>A.</strong> No, no, no! If you&#x27;re doing that, you&#x27;re not actually targeting the path of anything! Let&#x27;s say a donut costs $1 this year, in year 0. At 2% inflation, it would cost $1.02 next year, and $1.04 in year 2, and $1.22 in year 10. Let&#x27;s say that you miss your inflation target for this year and the donut ends up costing $1.01 next year. If you just shrug and say, &quot;Oh, well, I&#x27;ll try for 2% again,&quot; then your new plan is for the donut to cost $1.03 in year 2, instead of $1.04. And $1.21 in year 10. As a result of getting less inflation than you wanted, you changed your monetary target to be tighter—you changed your mind and aimed to have a donut cost less in year 10, then you previously said a donut should cost in year 10. That&#x27;s exactly the sort of thing that promotes positive feedback loops!</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> What do you mean, I&#x27;m tightening my monetary policy? I&#x27;m still saying &quot;I want 2% per year inflation&quot;, right?</p><p><strong>A.</strong> Before, the markets expected you to target $1.22 per donut in year 10. Now they expect you to target $1.21. That&#x27;s a tightened monetary policy! And what&#x27;s much worse is if you do this every year, and the markets rapidly realize that in real life the donut will only be $1.10 in year 10. Now the market expects a much tighter monetary policy and they&#x27;ll consider money much more valuable than you say you want it to be. And people will hold onto even more money. Which will make you &#x27;miss&#x27; your inflation &#x27;target&#x27; even more. Which will make you tighten future price targets again, and so on.</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> So what should I do instead? Tell everyone that I really, really want 2% inflation next year?</p><p><strong>A.</strong> To target the path or maintain a level target, if you get 1% inflation in year 0, you have to create even more money in year 1 to make up for the missed target in year 0. Even if year 1 comes out to $1.01, you still have to target $1.04 for year 2, $1.06 for year 3, and so on. That way, it doesn&#x27;t matter as much if you overshoot in one year, because the stance of long-term monetary policy won&#x27;t have changed in response to that. The same theory also works for combating hyperinflation—you just create less money next year, or destroy money, if you overshoot. And if you stick to that policy, the market will rapidly come to expect it, and they won&#x27;t value your country&#x27;s currency this year more or less than your long-term level target says your currency will be worth. The markets will know you&#x27;ll put the path back on track, and the weak form of the efficient markets hypothesis says you can&#x27;t have publicly predictable price changes. That&#x27;s the &quot;rational expectations channel&quot; which is the second key to achieving price stability. The third key is to use prediction markets on how much money you need to create, so you don&#x27;t create too much or too little in the first place. But that&#x27;s just icing on the cake.</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> But what if even trying to target a nominal path still doesn&#x27;t work?</p><p><strong>A.</strong> If you (1) create increasingly more or less money as you go under or over your nominal path target, (2) show the market that you are fully committed to that target, and (3) use a prediction market to target the size of intervention, then <em>you will hit</em> 2%/year inflation, or 5%/year NGDP growth, or constant gold prices, or any other single nominal price target you choose. You could have your prices deflate by exactly 2% per year, not that you should, but you could, and the price level wouldn&#x27;t blow up over or under that. That&#x27;s the power of targeting a path! If you pick literally any single nominal variable you want—the price of silver, the price of a median haircut, literally anything—and you publicly declare a target price path and then consistently loosen when under the target and tighten when over the target, increasing the size of your action as you get further away from the path, and the market knows and believes this, that price path will be achieved, period. I mean, you can&#x27;t say that a kilo of gold should have a constant price path of $1 because you can&#x27;t afford to buy back and destroy enough dollars to make that be true. But that is the opposite of the problem that you currently have. You cannot run out of ability to make prices go higher. Running out of reserves can prevent a central bank from enforcing that its currency have a minimum value, but you cannot run out of ones and zeroes when it comes to enforcing your currency&#x27;s maximum value. Just sell more of the currency!</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> Okay, I could see firmly committing on that policy up to creating $15, but any more than that, and I&#x27;d have to give up.</p><p><strong>A.</strong> Then the price will not be stable. The market will know that if there&#x27;s enough deflation, you&#x27;ll print $15 and then give up. They can see that coming, so they&#x27;ll get nervous as soon as the price starts to drop. If the markets think you&#x27;re not truly committed, they&#x27;re very likely to test you. This is true even if you&#x27;re doing something that ought to be impossible to fail at, like keeping a price high or putting a ceiling on your currency&#x27;s value, because markets know that central banks often get nervous and change their minds.</p><p>You&#x27;ve got to be ready to actually follow through! If you are truly committed you can stabilize any one price path, but if you stop stabilizing the path, it stops being stable, and markets can make billions of dollars if they can successfully predict when you&#x27;ll give up.</p><p>But remember, you literally can&#x27;t lose at keeping a nominal price high so long as your determination holds. Just hold down the trigger until the target is destroyed or you run out of bullets, bearing in mind that you cannot run out of bullets.</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> So I&#x27;d have to really commit myself? That&#x27;s scary! Well, I guess I could commit myself and then change my mind later if it doesn&#x27;t work out. But what if I undershoot my price path, print even more money next year, and still can&#x27;t hit my targeted price path?</p><p><strong>A.</strong> Then <em>you did not create enough money, god damn it</em>. That&#x27;s what the prediction market is for. But even then, if you&#x27;re consistently an embarrassing 1% under the path, that&#x27;s a whole lot more stable than undershooting your 2% inflation target by a variable amount every year.</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> What if I&#x27;m undershooting my price path by more and more each year?</p><p><strong>A.</strong> Increase the size of your action even faster as you get even further away from the target path. Like, have your action increase as the square of the amount you missed, or something like that. Better yet, target the market forecast. Better yet, use a prediction market to figure out how much money you need to create or destroy.</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> What if no matter how much money I print it still doesn&#x27;t change prices?</p><p><strong>A.</strong> Then why is your government even bothering to collect taxes?</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> I mean… couldn&#x27;t the problem be that the money I create is staying in bank accounts instead of doing anything?</p><p><strong>A.</strong> Uh, aren&#x27;t you currently paying positive interest on bank reserves held at your central account? If you think that&#x27;s the problem you definitely should not be paying positive interest on reserves.</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> But paying 0.25% interest on reserves makes me feel better.</p><p><strong>A.</strong> Why?</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> I don&#x27;t know, it just does. Uh, maybe it causes my banks not to make stupid loans if they know they can at least get 0.25% interest by holding the money inside me?</p><p><strong>A.</strong> I guess that&#x27;s possible, and stupid loans are a problem, but… if you do pay positive interest on reserves, that makes banks more reluctant to lend and reflects a tighter monetary policy. It changes the amount of money that&#x27;s &#x27;enough&#x27;. It means you&#x27;ll need to create even more, more money, when you&#x27;ve already been undershooting your inflation target for several years running. Indeed, some relatively wise central banks are charging negative interest on excess reserves.</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> Why do you say they&#x27;re only <em>relatively</em> wise?</p><p><strong>A.</strong> Because if they were absolutely wise they&#x27;d have created enough money to create enough inflation that they wouldn&#x27;t need to charge negative interest. But regardless, paying positive interest on reserves is kinda like transforming that currency into a new kind of government bond. It might be harmless if you could print enough enough-money, but otherwise it&#x27;s probably not a wise thing to do, even if it makes you feel better. Think of it as a luxury reserved for good central banks that don&#x27;t undershoot their inflation target.</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> Yeah… I&#x27;ve been wondering if maybe my currency is pretty much interchangeable with government bonds, now. Maybe when I buy government bonds from the sort of people who own government bonds in the first place, they just keep my currency around and don&#x27;t buy anything else with it. Maybe I need to inject the money somewhere else.</p><p><strong>A.</strong> First, like many other problems having to do with deflation, this hypothetical problem, if it existed, would be one that you could solve with <em>moar money</em>. There is some amount of money creation that overflows into the hands of people who can buy real things, that gets things moving again and causes all the factories to work at capacity and people to be employed and flows through all the trades that people can make.</p><p>Second, it does seem dubious that the injection site makes much of a difference, because demand for money is fungible, and if you add more money in one place it&#x27;s generic supply that competes in a global pool of generic demand.</p><p>Third, if you think that&#x27;s the problem, then for god&#x27;s sake stop paying positive interest on reserves when you&#x27;re already undershooting your target.</p><p>Fourth, if a wrong injection site or fungibility with bonds really was the problem, and you didn&#x27;t want to brute-force it with <em>moar money</em>, you could create money and buy a broad basket of low-past-volatility equities that are easy to short-sell and hence correctly priced. Or… well, optimal monetary policy is a lot simpler than optimal politics, and I understand the latter a lot less well than the former. But maybe you could make your central bankers put on suits, and go to your politicians with hat in hand, and humbly say, &quot;I&#x27;m sorry, we screwed up and undershot 8 years&#x27; worth of publicly declared inflation targets, and we need to give the markets a sign that we&#x27;re serious this time. Can you please let us send every citizen a check for $2000 just this one time?&quot;</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> My government would never let me do that!</p><p><strong>A.</strong> Are you sure? I&#x27;m not a government myself, but I kinda imagine that if you made your central bankers put on their best suits and tell the government&#x27;s politicians that you just had to send all their voters a bunch of free money—</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> But that&#x27;s exactly the opposite of the way that central banks are supposed to be wiser and more paternal than governments, and tell governments &#x27;no&#x27; about fun things they&#x27;re not allowed to do! I&#x27;d never be able to look other central banks in the eye again!</p><p><strong>A.</strong> Maybe you could compensate for the emotional damage by eating a lot of chocolate or something? It doesn&#x27;t seem like the same order of problem as unemployed people slowly sinking into despair.</p><p>And if you go to the legislature and ask them for the statutory authority to mail citizens checks after undershooting your inflation mandate for three years running, the markets will go &quot;Oh holy poot, they mean it this time, let&#x27;s stop hoarding this currency&quot; and you won&#x27;t even have to mail the check.</p><p>Failing that? Bleeping do it. Think of it as declaring a country-wide dividend where every citizen gets an equal share of the new money needed to animate an economy that expands over time. I mean, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend mailing too many checks because that really would make it harder to destroy money later and prevent overinflation. But it would tell the markets you really, honestly meant your new monetary stance of Bleep This Bleeping Underinflation, I Own A Printing Press.</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> Listen, you don&#x27;t understand how things are in my country! My government is full of politicians just looking for an excuse to tear me to bits, and if I so much as asked to mail checks to people, they would! Frankly, I&#x27;m worried that I couldn&#x27;t print as much money as you think I should, even if I wanted to.</p><p><strong>A.</strong> Then I guess you&#x27;re not really in independent control of your country&#x27;s monetary policy, huh?</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> That&#x27;s… harsh. Though, the thought of not being blamed for anything does sound nice.</p><p><strong>A.</strong> Well, to be clear, if you aren&#x27;t already printing all the money you can print, under whatever political constraints, and promising the markets to print all the money you can print later until you reach a declared path target, then you are to blame if you undershoot your inflation target. Until you&#x27;re doing that, you&#x27;re not doing everything you can; and whatever level of money is flowing through your economy, you did choose that particular level and no higher, so you&#x27;re responsible for whatever damage it does.</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> But… you just don&#x27;t realize the obstacles here! What if other countries don&#x27;t like me weakening my currency relative to their currency? They&#x27;ll yell at me that I&#x27;m exporting my deflation to them!</p><p><strong>A.</strong> If another country thinks their currency is too expensive, they can print more of it.</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> But that just exports the deflation back to me. Isn&#x27;t this a zero-sum game?</p><p><strong>A.</strong> No. If you both print more money, then your relative exchange rate stays the same and you both undershoot your stated inflation targets less pathetically every bleeping year after year.</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> But what if they refuse to print more money, and then blame me for adding to their deflationary pressures?</p><p><strong>A. </strong>Then you can send them a recorded video message of you screaming at the top of your lungs that they should just <em>print more money</em>. No country that has not physically run out of ones and zeroes has the right to blame anyone or anything else for their own currency&#x27;s excess value.</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> Hm… I just realized, if they did make their currency cheaper relative to mine, they&#x27;d export more goods to me, which could steal away jobs from my country! Should I really be reminding them of that?</p><p><strong>A.</strong> That is not how Ricardo&#x27;s Law of Comparative Advantage works. Imagine a world where nobody invests in other countries or builds up foreign currency reserves from year to year. In this world, every foreign car has to be purchased with foreign currency that was obtained by selling them a domestic computer in the same year. Right? So your relative exchange rate doesn&#x27;t affect the number of computers you need to sell to buy a car—the price of foreign cars in domestic computers. Conversely, if a country is selling you cars and then just keeping some of your currency in warehouses while it slowly depreciates, then they&#x27;ll send you more cars than you ship computers to them, regardless of relative exchange rates.</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> Then you&#x27;re not arguing that I should print lots of money to make my currency cheaper so I can sell more things to foreigners and make sure that I&#x27;m stealing their jobs instead of the other way around?</p><p><strong>A.</strong> No! One, lots of the countries trying to sell you things have median incomes much lower than yours, and I frankly don&#x27;t see how it could be anything but mustache-twirling cartoon villainy if I did advise you how to thrive at their expense. Two, that&#x27;s not how Ricardo&#x27;s Law of Comparative Advantage works. And three, if being able to get more cars by making computers and trading them for cars, actually &#x27;destroyed jobs&#x27;, then combine harvesters would also reduce employment because they produced tons more grain and destroyed farming jobs. If that was really the way economics worked, then the 100-fold increase in agricultural productivity since the medieval era when 98% of the population was made up of farmers, would have caused only 3% of your population to have jobs today. The people inside you are better off when they have more stuff, not when they need to do more work. Have you heard of the broken window fallacy?</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> That&#x27;s where, if your economy isn&#x27;t doing well, you just break a lot of windows, and then people have to repair their windows, which gives employment to glaziers, who spend their wages at bakeries, who pay farmers, and the whole economy is stimulated and does better, right?</p><p><strong>A.</strong> Well, that&#x27;s the fallacy. The problem is that you&#x27;re not accounting for opportunity costs. Breaking a window just means that you have to divert glass, labor, and money from other uses—the repair, and the money for the repair, aren&#x27;t magical events that occur without trading off against anything else. Furthermore, the idea that the town does better, just because more money is being spent, implies that there wasn&#x27;t yet enough money to animate all the trades that could be made. But if there&#x27;s not enough money to go around, so that money rather than glassmaking capacity is the limiting factor on how many windows get made, then breaking windows means that limiting-factor money gets diverted from somewhere else!</p><p>I mean… the only way breaking windows could actually add jobs, is if the economy was being limited by low money flow so there was spare glassmaking capacity and spare labor, and if the person paying to repair the windows took the money out of an otherwise inactive bank account, and then the windows-repairer didn&#x27;t try to save more money later to make up for the loss. Not only would that happen very rarely, but if it did happen, it would mean you&#x27;d been asleep on your job! The only real benefit is coming from spending down an otherwise inactive bank account to add money to a money-limited system! The whole purpose of your existence is to make sure that the amount of glass flowing is bound by the amount of sand and heat available, not by there being insufficient money to flow the other way.</p><p>The broken windows fallacy is a fallacy, there isn&#x27;t some counterintuitive way to make people be better off by breaking their windows—or by outlawing clever harvesters that produce more grain with less labor—or by outlawing building cars by sending other people computers in exchange for cars—so long as you&#x27;re creating enough money. But you shouldn&#x27;t be worrying about which exact particular places your economy is allocating its labor, or whether it&#x27;s more efficient to get cars by building them from scratch versus trading computers for them. I mean, maybe there should be some part of your government that worries about things like runaway occupational licensing or real marginal tax rates owing to benefit phase-outs, but not the central bank part!</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> But my government does keep telling me to think about both inflation and jobs. That means I can&#x27;t put just inflation on a particular target path like you say, because then I wouldn&#x27;t be thinking about jobs too! I need to think about two things at once, which is why I have to use an ad-hoc policy and hold big important meetings where I change my mind all the time. This dual target also explains why I&#x27;m always very worried about overshooting 2% inflation even when employment has been dropping, and why I keep ending up with too little inflation and too little employment simultaneously.</p><p><strong>A. </strong>Yes, it&#x27;s bad when people are unemployed. It&#x27;s very unpleasant and it destroys real value. You want to minimize that as much as you can. This gets us into another topic, which is that even targeting inflation at a 2%/year level path isn&#x27;t all that great an idea. It&#x27;s better than trying to target the amount of base money, sure. But you could still have something bad happen where people became more reluctant to trade at the same time as a lot of money was destroyed. In that case you might end up with the same amount of total &#x27;inflation&#x27; per trade, even though there were idle factories and people that you could put to work by creating more money.</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> So I should just make more money whenever I eyeball that I think my economy is doing less than it could, but stop if inflation goes too high?</p><p><strong>A.</strong> Honestly, that might be better than some of the other things you could be doing! Though it would be important to only stop when the market said inflation was about to go too high, not when you were feeling a little nervous that it might go high later.</p><p>However, there&#x27;s a simpler and more formal answer that accomplishes the same thing and creates much more stability. Instead of targeting 2%/year inflation, target the total amount of money changing hands in your economy and make that quantity go up by 5%/year on a level price path. This quantity is called NGDP, or Nominal Gross Domestic Product.</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> Huh, NGDP. I remember hearing bad things about that measure. Like, it&#x27;s a stupid measure of my country&#x27;s health, because it doesn&#x27;t take into account how a computer at the same price can be much more powerful. And people even try to include military spending into NGDP, and so on.</p><p><strong>A.</strong> That&#x27;s okay! We&#x27;re not using NGDP as a proxy measure of how much fun your country is having. We&#x27;re using NGDP as exactly what it is, a measure of the total flow of money changing hands.</p><p>When NGDP accelerates above trend, your country&#x27;s monetary policy is too loose, and there&#x27;ll be too much money competing for each transaction. If NGDP drops below trend, your country&#x27;s monetary policy is too tight, and there won&#x27;t be enough money for each transaction.</p><p>And again, price-setters are reluctant to lower their prices, often much more so than people are reluctant to pay increased prices—or price-setters are first in line to raise prices when they have market power, but try to be last in line to drop them. It&#x27;s not a rational-agent theorem, but it&#x27;s definitely an empirically observed fact. So when NGDP drops, many transactions will stop happening at all, which destroys the real value of the gains from trade, which is bad. By targeting NGDP, you&#x27;re targeting the flow of money directly. It means that every shopkeeper knows that the country as a whole will spend 5% more money next year, no matter what else happens. Now doesn&#x27;t that sound nice and stable?</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> What does that have to do with unemployment, though?</p><p><strong>A.</strong> In most ways, NGDP is a mirror image of Nominal Gross Domestic Income, the amount of money that everyone receives to spend. Some economists suggest you should be targeting NGDI instead, because it seems to be a more stable estimate that gets adjusted afterwards less often than NGDP estimates. But leaving that aside and just inverting the way we look at things, keeping NGDI on a level upward path ensures that money-flow is available to pay everyone who wants to work. That&#x27;s the secret hidden inside the idea that when unemployment rises, you should create more money. What you&#x27;re really doing is adding more wage-flow so that more people can be employed. Think of NGDI as being like a game of musical chairs—all the people who are employed need flowing money to pay them. So if there isn&#x27;t enough NGDI flowing through the system, somebody has to become unemployed! That&#x27;s why sharp drops in employment track the graph for sharp drops in NGDP much more than they track the graph for lower inflation. So to make sure the economy can steadily add as many jobs as it has room for, you target the path of NGDI or the total amount of money flowing, not &#x27;inflation&#x27;.</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> But if I don&#x27;t target inflation, won&#x27;t inflation go totally out of control?</p><p><strong>A.</strong> It would be very hard for that to happen under an NGDP level targeting regime. If the total amount of money flowing always increases at exactly 5% per year and returns to path from any level deviation, it&#x27;d be very hard for prices in the economy to regularly go up at 10% per year. I mean, maybe you&#x27;re worried that a specified NGDP target implies that there&#x27;d be twice as much money-flow per transaction if half your country&#x27;s residents died to a bioengineered superplague—</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> Yes! That would be very bad. Prices could double!</p><p><strong>A.</strong> Then you can just target NGDP per capita—not per employee, of course, but per inhabitant of the currency area—and that would be fine too. That way you won&#x27;t get large amounts of inflation no matter what happens.</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> Will that also prevent asset bubbles from forming? Sometimes people blame me for that too.</p><p><strong>A.</strong> Any asset bubble that can happen with 5%/year NGDP growth is probably one that would&#x27;ve happened no matter what you did. Plus, remember, a central bank only has one price of money to control, and it affects literally everything in your country. You should use that one lever to make sure that the country as a whole will always spend 5% more money next year. So long as you do that, asset bubbles shouldn&#x27;t do much damage when they pop, and you probably can&#x27;t even prevent them in the first place, and if you did try to mess with them and went off the NGDP level path to do so you&#x27;d be screwing up everything else. The way your country&#x27;s security regulators can prevent price bubbles is by making sure that an asset class is very cheap and easy to short—that there&#x27;s no obstacles that add expense or difficulty or uncertainty to buying put options.</p><p>Not to mention, a lot of times when people yell &#x27;bubble&#x27; the market goes up further before it eventually goes down. Which is just an ordinary problem of not knowing whether an asset is too high or too low, and you might not be any smarter about that than hedge-fund managers. But if an asset price goes too high and people can actually tell, it&#x27;s often because there&#x27;s a systemic difficulty that makes shorting the asset too difficult or too expensive.</p><p>Regardless, all of that just shouldn&#x27;t be your concern. Just focus on making sure that 5% more nominal money will be spent next year. If a price bubble can&#x27;t change that by inflating or bursting, it probably can&#x27;t affect the rest of the economy very much. And trying to &#x27;pop&#x27; the price of one asset class you think might maybe be a &#x27;bubble&#x27;, is definitely not worth the collateral damage of allowing the whole country&#x27;s NGDP to drop below trend, or the collateral damage of abandoning your declared target path.</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> Okay, I&#x27;m not sure I believe you about this &#x27;NGDP targeting&#x27; business, but you&#x27;ve at least convinced me to try, you know, printing an amount of money that strikes me as insane. And you&#x27;d better believe I am going to buy back all those bonds and destroy this money the second this economy starts to hyperinflate… huh, that&#x27;s interesting.</p><p><strong>A.</strong> What happened?</p><p>Q. Prices went up 1.5% and unemployment got closer to its normal level, though labor force participation is still down... that means it&#x27;s now time to raise interest rates to above zero, right?</p><p>A. <em>NO!</em> Wait, what? What are you doing? You&#x27;ll choke off your recovery! Do you have any idea how badly the markets have already reacted several years earlier because they already knew you would tighten monetary policy the instant there was any hint of recovery?</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> But if I don&#x27;t raise interest rates now, I won&#x27;t have any room to cut interest rates later, if things get worse again—</p><p><strong>A.</strong> <em>Aaarg! Stop!</em> That is not how interest rate targeting works!</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> It&#x27;s not? I always thought that cutting the interest rate stimulates the economy. And it works, so far as I can tell. Back when things were better, I&#x27;d cut rates half a point and the economy would go vssshhoooom just like pressing the accelerator pedal on a car. But I can&#x27;t cut interest rates below zero, or, I mean, some people say I can, but I&#x27;m not sure I believe them. So obviously, if I might need to cut rates later in case of a recession, I should raise the interest rate now when it won&#x27;t do much damage. That way I have room to cut it later!</p><p><strong>A.</strong> <em>NO.</em> Don&#x27;t. That&#x27;s like stopping your antibiotic treatment in mid-course so you can &#x27;increase the amount of antibiotics later&#x27; if you get sicker. It&#x27;s not just based on an instinctive brain-level misunderstanding of whether it&#x27;s &#x27;taking antibiotics&#x27; or &#x27;adding more antibiotics&#x27; that is the effective intervention, it actually makes the disease more resistant. Charging 3% interest means a very different thing in terms of monetary policy, depending on whether you&#x27;re in Japan or Zimbabwe. In Zimbabwe, if you offer someone a loan at 3% interest, it is a super-cheap loan. In Japan, if you offer someone a loan at 3% interest, it is an expensive loan. Depending on whether there&#x27;s more or less inflation, the same nominal interest rate on a loan can make the money cheap or expensive. If you raise rates now, you&#x27;re tightening monetary policy, which brings the natural interest rate downward, which in the future will make the same nominal interest rate target represent a tighter monetary policy.</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> I&#x27;m not sure I understand.</p><p><strong>A.</strong> If you raise rates now, inflation will be lower than it otherwise would. Which means that if you later &#x27;drop&#x27; future rates to 0.1% in case of a recession, that future 0.1% interest rate will be less effective and represent less monetary stimulus, than a rate of 0.1% would have represented if you&#x27;d just held the rate constant today. You are not giving yourself more ammunition before you hit the &#x27;zero bound&#x27;. You are giving yourself less ammunition before you hit the &#x27;zero bound&#x27;, and also you&#x27;re choking off your economy&#x27;s nascent recovery.</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> So you&#x27;re saying… raising rates now will make the economy weaker, so when I press the accelerator pedal later, it will be less effective?</p><p><strong>A.</strong> No, more like braking changes the real distance of the accelerator from the control system&#x27;s zero, which isn&#x27;t the same as the accelerator&#x27;s physical distance from the floor mat.</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> What?</p><p><strong>A.</strong> I&#x27;m saying that you need to think in terms of the effect of an interest rate instead of the effect of an interest rate drop. If you raise interest rates now, a future nominal rate of 0.1% will be less powerful in an absolute sense later. So even though you&#x27;ll have the ability to &#x27;drop&#x27; interest rates later, you&#x27;ll be dropping it to a level of stimulus that&#x27;s less powerful in an absolute sense, because inflation will be lower after you signal a tightened monetary policy, so the real interest rate represented by a fixed nominal rate will be higher and money will be more expensive—</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> I still don&#x27;t understand.</p><p><strong>A.</strong> Look, just… you don&#x27;t need to &#x27;create more ammunition for later&#x27; because you can&#x27;t run out of ammunition. You can just create more ones and zeroes if the economy needs them, no matter what the &#x27;interest rate&#x27; looks like.</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> But if I don&#x27;t raise interest rates now, I&#x27;ll be embarrassed in front of the other central banks!</p><p><strong>A.</strong> If you tighten rates now then you will have to keep rates even lower for longer and create even more money later because inflation will go down and, worse, the markets will have learned that you undershoot your inflation target. They will expect overly-timid monetary policy in the future, which by the EMH (weak form) encourages traders to hoard more of your currency now and is a more contractionary monetary policy now.</p><p>If you&#x27;d cut rates fast enough in 2008, you could have kept the money flow from cratering, and a 2% nominal interest rate would represent a lower real interest rate than we have today. And then you wouldn&#x27;t have needed to do quantitative easing later on. Not to mention all the banks that wouldn&#x27;t have failed.</p><p>Well, it isn&#x27;t any different today. The more money you print now, the less you will be embarrassed later. The more you tighten rates now, the longer you&#x27;ll have to keep them &#x27;embarrassingly low&#x27;.</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> But interest rates have already been low for so long! It doesn&#x27;t look good when I have to keep interest rates low for super-long! It signals that I think my economy is weak!</p><p><strong>A.</strong> I&#x27;m sorry, but nobody believes your predictions about the economy any more. They&#x27;ve seen you overstate your predictions every year for a decade, and they have a market forecast to look at instead. Traders do care about how the central bank thinks the economy is doing, but that&#x27;s because every time you think the economy is doing well, you tighten monetary policy and they want to forecast the resulting damage.</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> But… if I raise interest rates by half a percentage point, won&#x27;t it signal that I think the economy is doing really well, and people will believe me and perk up and the economy will do better and stocks will rise?</p><p><strong>A.</strong> Is that what actually happened the last time you tried that?</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> Well, no, but—</p><p><strong>A.</strong> Look. You&#x27;re making your life more complicated than it needs to be. If you&#x27;re undershooting your target path for inflation or for whatever, create more money. Do not destroy money. Do not start undoing your quantitative easing. Do not raise interest rates. Not for signaling reasons, not to give yourself &quot;ammunition for later&quot;, not because &quot;interest rates have been low for too long&quot;. Just don&#x27;t… tighten… policy when you&#x27;re still undershooting your target. Any nominal variable you&#x27;re targeting, whether it&#x27;s inflation or NGDP, if you undershoot the path, then loosen monetary policy. It&#x27;s <em>not that complicated</em>.</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> Hey, I just thought of a clever idea. Maybe I can get my government to borrow more money and spend it. That way I can create less new money and still meet my inflation target!</p><p><strong>A.</strong> Please don&#x27;t. That will accomplish <em>literally nothing</em> except to create a huge burden of government debt. If every dollar the government spends is one less dollar you create, it has <em>literally zero</em> net stimulatory effect on the economy. If you think the economy as a whole is spending too little money, you should <em>create more money</em>. There is no reason the government&#x27;s fiscal policy should be involved. At all. Ever. There is no way your government can push on money-flow by borrowing a dollar to spend, that you, the central bank, cannot do at lower human cost by creating a temporary dollar from scratch. The only reason for a government to buy a highway is if the highway is worth the money. Doing it for &#x27;stimulus&#x27; is completely pointless if the central bank is effectively targeting inflation or any other nominal variable. Every dollar the government borrows to spend, is one less dollar the central bank creates to reach their nominal target. If the &#x27;fiscal multiplier&#x27; is not zero, it means the central bank is not effectively targeting the price of anything and your president ought to be fired. Your inflation target is your problem and you shouldn&#x27;t try to shove it onto your government.</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> That&#x27;s certainly an interesting political stance, but…</p><p><strong>A.</strong> Political stance? It is an empirical statement about how money works. Remember when there was this big, scary &#x27;sequester&#x27; that was supposed to sharply cut US government spending in the middle of a recession? The Federal Reserve scraped up some more courage, printed a corresponding amount of money, and nothing happened. There was a nice little to-do where the Keynesians predicted economic disaster and the market monetarists said &#x27;Nothing will happen so long as the Fed prints a corresponding amount of money&#x27; and the market monetarists were experimentally correct. It was a clear-cut test of two competing theories and the results were also clear. If you are able to print more money when more money is needed, your government can cut spending without any monetary effects.</p><p>I mean, maybe you won&#x27;t get a new highway and people&#x27;s cars will crash. But the part where the economy crashes due to decreased total spending is something you can prevent by adding more money. In fact this will happen automatically if the central bank is in a regime where they will respond incrementally to incremental movement away from their price target—</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> Wait… hold on… god damn it, not again. I&#x27;m sorry, I need to put this conversation on hold while I bail out one of my country&#x27;s big banks.</p><p><strong>A.</strong> What? Why would you do that? Wouldn&#x27;t that create a huge moral hazard?</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> I know that! God, I know. But if I don&#x27;t bail out this bank, some other banks might fail too!</p><p><strong>A.</strong> So?</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> And some brokerages might fail! There&#x27;d be systemic contagion!</p><p><strong>A.</strong> Okay…?</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> And almost everyone has their hands in someone else&#x27;s pants! Our whole financial sector could implode!</p><p><strong>A.</strong> Truly, the tree of prudent investment must be watered from time to time with the blood of idiots. Shall we watch the fireworks together? I&#x27;ll grab some popcorn.</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> No, see… it&#x27;s bad if lots of financial companies go bankrupt! I&#x27;ve got to stop that from happening! It&#x27;s a disaster with banks in it, and I&#x27;m the Central Bank, so it must be my job to stop it!</p><p><strong>A.</strong> Why do you even care? So a bunch of financial companies go kerplooey and vaporize the virtual money of some rich people who trusted other people wearing fancy business suits. How does that affect an average household with two children? If anything, some suckers will have less currency with which to buy yachts, and some of the steel and concrete could go into making toys for the children instead. On a more abstract level, your rich-sucker institutions would have less currency with which to make mediocre investments, and the economic capacity thus freed up could go into good investments instead.</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> Such a huge financial disaster would have catastrophic effects on the real economy! The company that employs the parents at a haircut shop wouldn&#x27;t be able to get a loan to make payroll! The rich people who were buying haircuts from them will lose a bunch of money on the stock market and be unable to afford haircuts!</p><p><strong>A.</strong> That would be a problem of not enough money flowing, an instance of the problem class where the economy still has a bunch of factories but people don&#x27;t have enough money to buy things. You can prevent this problem by creating more money.</p><p>Look, you don&#x27;t even need to think about the details! Just ignore all the theatrics and keep outputting whatever amount of money the prediction market says is necessary to keep the total money flow, or Nominal Gross Domestic Product, on a level path target of 5% per year. I mean, if your country&#x27;s whole financial sector is melting down, the prediction market is probably going to tell you to create a lot of money, but that&#x27;s okay.</p><p>Um, it is admittedly true that this is really, really not the time to flinch from printing any required amount of money. You only want the bad banks to go bankrupt, not for all the banks to go bankrupt because there isn&#x27;t enough money in the entire system to pay off even the non-stupid loans—that latter part really is your job to prevent.</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> Do you have any idea the size of disaster we&#x27;d be risking?! What if the new money doesn&#x27;t reach people fast enough!?</p><p><strong>A.</strong> If market forecasts start to indicate that the real economy might be about to tank, I guess you could ask the legislature for the statutory authority to mail your citizens checks. If it&#x27;s really going bad that fast, you can use direct deposit, even. I think the politicians would let you do it under those conditions… right? I guess you&#x27;d have to be pretty sure they&#x27;d let you do it.</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> Even if the government did let me do it, are you seriously telling me that as a central bank, I should watch my country&#x27;s entire financial sector just burn to the ground?</p><p><strong>A.</strong> Not the entire sector. A bunch of people who made bad investments lose their shirts. If you were in a contagion environment where lots of banks were lending to bad investors or creating complicated derivatives with other banks who were, then lots of people lose their shirts. The good banks who stayed virtuous pick up the slack using all that new money you&#x27;re creating—temporarily, until velocity picks up—and a few years later, everyone&#x27;s investing more wisely.</p><p>As a central bank you have one job, to regularize the total flow of money through the economy. You make sure there&#x27;s enough money in the total system for people to pay off good loans. You make sure that the family with two kids has enough money in hand to pay for groceries.</p><p>As a central bank, you have one superpower—the absolute ability to control the path of any one nominal variable. Use that power to promise every shopkeeper that the country will spend 5% more money next year. Promise every employee that the country will have 5% more nominal income to flow into wages, promise every honest bank that there will be 5% more money flow to pay back loans to productive enterprises. And then tell your too-big-to-fails to go hang!</p><p>You might need to sell a ludicrously huge amount of currency to keep money flow on-path if over fifty percent of your financial sector is burning merrily to the ground, especially if this is the first time you&#x27;re doing this and people are scared your determination will break. And then, as good banks start to take over the loan-making capacity, you&#x27;ll need to buy back a lot of that ludicrously huge amount of currency. But that&#x27;s all you need to do.</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> This sounds really scary! I&#x27;d rather take a bunch of ad-hoc half-measures and throw enormous amounts of money at a bunch of total bastards and create terrifying amounts of moral hazard just to avoid the temporary cleansing fire that would have cleaned a lot of gunk out of the system and maybe even reduced inequality!</p><p><strong>A.</strong> Well, you certainly won&#x27;t be alone if you go that route.</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> How can you just say that I should let a huge amount of virtual money go up in smoke while temporarily creating enough new money to prevent real-world disruption? How can I let so many banks fail when everyone with more than $250,000 invested at a bad bank will only have $250,000 left plus whatever percentage of the bank&#x27;s other assets were recoverable, with a compensating amount of new money being temporarily added somewhere else to level the total money flow through the economy?</p><p><strong>A.</strong> It&#x27;s simple! You just declare an NGDP path target, set up a prediction market, tell an intern to do whatever the prediction market says, and then go on vacation for the rest of your life as a central bank!</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> This is madness!</p><p><strong>A.</strong> Madness? <em>This... is... market monetarism!</em></p>

I start by better pinning down exactly what is meant by ‘epistemic modesty’, go on to offer a variety of reasons that motivate it, and reply to some common objections. Along the way, I show common traps people being inappropriately modest fall into. I conclude that modesty is a superior epistemic strategy, and ought to be more widely used - particularly in the EA/rationalist communities.</p><p>[<a href=""https://www.google.com/url?q=http://docs.google.com/document/d/1sqfilo7hEbZeCG20GQnXFngvbBUkqWdg5W082OZIcBE/&sa=D&ust=1509307926150000&usg=AFQjCNE3QPTN0ciw-b5AxseRSONbAGuFDw"">gdoc</a>]</p><h2>Provocation</h2><p>I argue for this:</p><blockquote>In virtually all cases, the credence you hold for any given belief should be dominated by the balance of credences held by your epistemic peers and superiors. One’s own convictions should weigh no more heavily in the balance than that of one other epistemic peer. </blockquote><h1>Introductions and clarifications</h1><h2>A favourable motivating case</h2><p>Suppose your mother thinks they can make some easy money day trading blue-chip stocks, and plans to kick off tomorrow shorting Google on the stock market, as they’re sure it’s headed for a crash. You might want to dissuade her in a variety of ways.</p><p></p><p>You might appeal to an outside view:</p><p></p><blockquote>Mum, when you make this short you’re going to be betting against some hedge fund, quant, or whatever else. They have loads of advantages: relevant background, better information, lots of data and computers, and so on. Do you really think you’re odds on to win this bet?</blockquote><p></p><p>Or appeal to some reference class:</p><p></p><blockquote>Mum, I’m pretty sure the research says that people trying to day-trade stocks tend not to make much money at all. Although you might hear some big successes on the internet, you don’t hear about everyone else who went bust. So why should you think you are likely to be one of these remarkable successes?</blockquote><p></p><p>Or just cite disagreement:</p><p></p><blockquote>Look Mum: Dad, sister, the grandparents and I all think this is a really bad idea. Please don’t do it!</blockquote><p></p><p>Instead of directly challenging the object level claim (i.e. “Google isn’t overvalued, because X”). These considerations attempt to situate the cogniser within some population, and from characteristics of this population infer the likelihood of this cogniser getting things right.  </p><p></p><p>Call the practice of using these techniques considerations epistemic modesty. We can distinguish two components:</p><ol><li>‘In theory’ modesty: That considerations of this type should in principle influence our credences.</li><li>‘In practice’ modesty: That one should in fact use these considerations when forming credences. </li></ol><h2>Weaker and stronger forms of modesty</h2><p>Some degree of modesty is (almost) inarguable. If one leaves for work on Tuesday and finds all your neighbours left their bins out, that’s at least reason to doubt your belief bins were on Thursday, and perhaps sufficient to believe instead bins are on Tuesday (and follow suit with your bins). If it appears that, say, the coagulation cascade ‘couldn’t evolve’, the near unanimity of assent for evolution among biologists at least counts against this, if not a decisive reason, despite one&#x27;s impressions, that it could. Nick Beckstead <a href=""https://www.google.com/url?q=http://lesswrong.com/lw/iao/common_sense_as_a_prior/&sa=D&ust=1509307926154000&usg=AFQjCNGeVCjL5FffvvorhqOw_xjGbhX4XQ"">suggests</a> something like ‘elite common sense’ forms a prior which one should be hesitant to diverge from without good reason. </p><p></p><p>I argue for something much stronger (c.f. the Provocation above): in theory, one’s credence in some proposition P should be almost wholly informed by modest considerations. That, ceteris paribus, the fact it appears to you that P should weigh no more heavily in one’s determination regarding P than knowing that it appears to someone else that P. Not only is this the case in theory, but it is also the case in practice. One’s all things considered judgement on P should be just that implied by an idealized expert consensus on P, no matter one’s own convictions regarding P. </p><h1>Motivations for more modesty</h1><p>Why believe ‘strong form’ epistemic modesty? I first show families of cases where ‘strong modesty’ leads to predictably better performance, and show these results generalise widely.<a href=""https://www.lesserwrong.com/editPost?postId=SJKowjkGF7z2sS98f#ftnt1"">[1]</a> </p><h2>The symmetry case  </h2><p>Suppose Adam and Beatrice are perfect epistemic peers, equal in all respects which could bear on them forming more or less accurate beliefs. They disagree on a particular proposition P (say “This tree is an Oak tree”). They argue about this at length, such that all considerations Adam takes to favour “This is an Oak tree” are known to Beatrice, and vice versa.<a href=""https://www.lesserwrong.com/editPost?postId=SJKowjkGF7z2sS98f#ftnt2"">[2]</a> After this, they still disagree: Adam has a credence of 0.8, Beatrice 0.4.</p><p></p><p>Suppose an outside party (call him Oliver) is asked for his credence of P, given Adam and Beatrice’s credences and their epistemic peer-hood to one another, but bereft of any object-level knowledge. He should split the difference between Adam and Beatrice - 0.6: Oliver doesn’t have any reason to favour Adam over Beatrice’s credence for P as they are epistemic peers, and so splitting the difference gives the least expected error.<a href=""https://www.lesserwrong.com/editPost?postId=SJKowjkGF7z2sS98f#ftnt3"">[3]</a> If he was faced with a large class of similar situations (maybe Adam and Beatrice get into the same argument for Tree 2 to Tree 10,000) Oliver would find that difference splitting has lower error than biasing to either Adam or Beatrice’s credence.</p><p></p><p>Adam and Beatrice should do likewise. They also know they are epistemic peers, and so they should also know that for whatever considerations explain their difference (perhaps Adam is really persuaded by the leaf shapes, but Beatrice isn’t) Adam’s take and Beatrice’s take are no more likely to be right than one another. So Adam should go (and Beatrice vice-versa), “I don’t understand why Beatrice isn’t persuaded by the leaf shapes, but she expresses the same about why I find it so convincing. Given she is my epistemic peer, ‘She’s not getting it’, and, ‘I’m not getting it’ are equally likely. So we should meet in the middle”.</p><p></p><p>The underlying intuition is one of symmetry. Adam and Beatrice have the same information. The correct credence regarding P given this information should not depend on which brain Adam or Beatrice happens to inhabit. Given this, they should hold the same credence<a href=""https://www.lesserwrong.com/editPost?postId=SJKowjkGF7z2sS98f#ftnt4"">[4]</a>, and as they Adam is as likely to be further from the truth than Beatrice, the shared credence should be in the middle.  </p><h2>Compressed sensing of (and not double-counting) the object level</h2><p>It seems odd that both Adam and Beatrice do better discarding their object level considerations regarding P. If we adjust the scenario above so they cannot discuss with one another but are merely informed of each other’s credences (and that they are peers regarding P), the right strategy remains to meet in the middle.<a href=""https://www.lesserwrong.com/editPost?postId=SJKowjkGF7z2sS98f#ftnt5"">[5]</a> Yet how come Adam and Beatrice are doing better if they ignore relevant information? Both Adam and Beatrice have their ‘inside view’ evidence (i.e. what they take to bear on the credence of P) and the ‘outside view’ evidence (what each other think about P). Why not use a hybrid strategy which uses both?</p><p></p><p>Yet to whatever extent Adam or Beatrice’s hybrid approach leads them to diverge from equal weight, they will do worse. Oliver can use the ‘meet in the middle strategy’ to get an expectedly better accuracy than either biasing towards their own inside view determination. In betting terms, Oliver can arbitrage any difference in credence between Adam and Beatrice.</p><p></p><p>We can explain why: the credences Adam and Beatrice offer can be thought of as very compressed summaries of the considerations they take to bear upon P. Whatever ‘inside view’ considerations Adam took to bear upon P are already ‘priced in’ to the credence he reports (ditto Beatrice). Modesty is not ignoring this evidence, but weighing it appropriately: if Adam then tries to adjust the outside view determination by his own take on the balance of evidence, he double counts his inside view: once in itself, and once more by including his credence as weighing equally to Beatrice’s in giving the outside view. </p><p></p><p>One’s take on the set of considerations regarding P may err, either by bias,<a href=""https://www.lesserwrong.com/editPost?postId=SJKowjkGF7z2sS98f#ftnt6"">[6]</a> ignorance, or ‘innocent’ mistake. Splitting the difference between you and your peer’s very high level summary of these captures the great fraction of benefit of hashing out where these summaries differ.<a href=""https://www.lesserwrong.com/editPost?postId=SJKowjkGF7z2sS98f#ftnt7"">[7]</a> Modesty correctly diagnoses that one’s high level summary is no more likely to be more accurate than one’s peers, and so holds those in equal regard, even in cases where the components of one’s own summary are known better.</p><h2>Repeated measures, brains as credence censors, and the wisdom of crowds</h2><p>Modesty outperforms non-modesty in the n=2 case. The degree of outperformance grows (albeit concavely) as n increases.</p><p></p><p>Scientific fields often have to deal with unreliable measurement. They commonly mitigate this by having repeat measurement. If you have a crummy thermometer, repeating readings several times improves accuracy over just the once. Human brains also try and measure things, and they are also often unreliable. It is commonly observed that nonetheless the average of their measurement tends to lie closer to the mark than the vast majority of individual measurements. Consider the commonplace ‘guess how many skittles are in this jar’ or similar estimation games: the <a href=""https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DiOucwX7Z1HU&sa=D&ust=1509307926158000&usg=AFQjCNEzGad2g9eRc9R5e2ih54P6k8sf3w"">usual observation</a> is that the average of all the guesses is better than all (or almost all) the individual guesses.</p><p></p><p>A toy model makes this unsurprising. The individual guesses will form some distribution centered on the true value. Thus the expected error of a given individual guess is the standard deviation of this distribution. The expected error of the average of all guesses is given by the standard error, which is the standard deviation divided by root(number of guesses):<a href=""https://www.lesserwrong.com/editPost?postId=SJKowjkGF7z2sS98f#ftnt8"">[8]</a> with 10 individuals, the error is about 3 times smaller than the expected error of each individual guess; with 100, 10 times smaller; and so on.</p><p></p><p>Analogously, human brains also try to measure credences or degrees of belief, and are similarly imperfect to when they’re trying to estimate ‘number of X’. Yet one may expect a similar effect to this ‘wisdom of crowds’ to operate here too. In the same way Adam and Beatrice would do better in the situation above if they took the average (even if it went against their view of the balance of reasons by their lights), if Adam-to-Zabaleta (all epistemic peers) investigated the same P, they’d expect to do better if they took the average of their group versus steadfastly holding to the credence they arrived at ‘by their lights’. Whatever inaccuracies that may throw off their individual estimates of P somewhat cancel out.</p><h2>Deferring to better brains</h2><p>The arguments above apply to cases where one is an epistemic peer. If not, one needs to adjust by some measure of ‘epistemic virtue’. In cases where Adam is an epistemic superior to Beatrice, they should meet closer to Adam’s view, commensurate with the degree of epistemic superiority (and vice versa).</p><p></p><p>Although reasons for being an epistemic superior could be ‘they’re a superforecaster’ or ‘they’re smarter than me’, perhaps the most common source of epistemic superiors lie under the heading of ‘subject matter expert’. On topics from human nutrition, to voting rules, to the impact of the minimum wage, to the nature of consciousness, to basically anything that isn’t trivial, one can usually find a fairly large group of very smart people who spend many years studying that topic, who make public their views about this topic (sometimes not even behind a paywall). That they at least have a much greater body of relevant information and have spent longer thinking about it gives them a large advantage compared to you. </p><p></p><p>In such cases, the analogy might be that your brain is a sundial, whilst theirs is an atomic clock. So if you have the option of taking their readings rather than yours, you should do so. The evidence a reading of a sundial provides about the time conditional on the atomic clock reading is effectively zero. ‘Splitting the difference’ in analagous epistemic cases should result with both you and your epistemic superior agreeing that they are right and you are wrong. </p><h2>Inference to the ideal epistemic observer </h2><p>We can summarise these motivations by analogy to ideal observers (used elsewhere in perception and ethical theory). We can gesture that an ideal (epistemic) observer is just that which is able to form the most accurate credence for P given whatever prior: we can explain they have vast intelligence, full knowledge of all matters that bear upon P, perfect judgement, and in essence all epistemic virtues in excelsis.</p><p></p><p>Now consider this helpful fiction:</p><blockquote>The epistemic fall: Imagine a population solely comprised of ideal observers, who all share the same (correct) view on P. Overnight their epistemic virtues are assailed: they lose some of their reasoning capacity; they pick up particular biases that could throw them one way or another; they lose information, and so on, and each one to varying degrees.</blockquote><blockquote>They wake up to find they now have all sorts of different credences about P, and none of them can remember what credence they all held yesterday. What should they do?</blockquote><p></p><p>It seems our fallen ideal observers can begin to piece together what their original credence was about P by finding out more about their credences and remaining epistemic virtue, and so backpropagate their return to epistemic apotheosis. If they find they’re all similarly virtuous and are evenly scattered, their best guess is the ideal observer was in the middle of the distribution (c.f. the wisdom of crowds). If they see a trend that those with greater residual virtue tend to hold a higher credence in P, they should attempt to extrapolate this trend to suggest the ideal agent origin from which they were differentially blown of course from. If they see one group demonstrates a bias that others do not, they can correct the position of this group before trying these procedures. If they find the more virtuous agents are more scattered regarding P, (or that they segregate into widely dispersed aggregations), this should make them very unsure about where the ideal observer initially was. And so on.</p><p></p><p>Such a model clarifies the benefit of modesty. Although we didn’t have some grand epistemic fall, it is clear we all fall manifestly short of an ideal observer. Yet we all fall short in different respects, and in different degrees. One should want to believe whatever one would believe if one was an ideal observer, shorn of one’s manifest epistemic vices. Purely immodest views must say their best guess is the ideal observer would think the same as they do, and hope that all the vicissitudes of their epistemic vice happen to cancel out. By accounting for the distribution of cognisers, modesty allows a much better forecast, and so a much more accurate belief. And the best such forecast is the strong form of modesty, where one’s particular datapoint, in and of itself, should not be counted higher than any other.</p><p></p><h1>Excursus: Against common justifications for immodesty</h1><p>So much for strong modesty in theory. How does it perform in practice?</p><p></p><p>One rough heuristic for strong modesty is this: for any question, find the plausible expert class to answer that question (e.g. if P is whether to raise the minimum wage, talk to economists). If this class converges on a particular answer, believe that answer too. If they do not agree, have little confidence in any answer. Do this no matter whether one’s impression of the object level considerations that recommend (by your lights) a particular answer.</p><p></p><p>Such a model captures all the common sense cases of modesty - trust the results in typical textbooks, defer to consensus in cases like when to put the bins out, and so on. I now show it is also better in many cases where people think it is better to be immodest.</p><h2>Being ‘well informed’ (or even true expertise) is not enough</h2><p>A common refrain is that one is entitled to ‘join issue’ with the experts due to one having made some non-trivial effort at improving one&#x27;s knowledge of the subject. “Sure, I accept experts widely disagree on macro-economics, but I’m confident in neo-Keynesianism after many months of careful study and reflection.”</p><p></p><p>This doesn’t fly by the symmetry argument above. Our outsider observes widespread disagreement in the area of macroeconomics, and that many experts who spend years on the subject nonetheless greatly disagree. Although it is possible the ideal observer would have been in one or another of the ‘camps’ (the clustering implies intermediate positions are less plausible), the outsider cannot adjudicate which one if we grant the economists in each appear to have similar levels of epistemic virtue. The balance of this outside view changes imperceptibly if another person who despite a few months of study remains nowhere near peerhood (let alone superiority) of these divided experts, happens to side with one camp or another. By symmetry, one&#x27;s own view of the balance of reason should remain unchanged if this ‘another person’ happened to be you.</p><p></p><p>The same applies even if you are a bona fide expert. Unless the distribution of expertise is such that there is a lone ‘world authority’ above all others (and you’re them) your fellow experts form your epistemic peer group. Taking the outside view is still the better bet: the consensus of experts tends to be right more often than dissenting experts, and so some difference splitting (weighed more to the consensus owing to their greater numbers) is the right answer.<a href=""https://www.lesserwrong.com/editPost?postId=SJKowjkGF7z2sS98f#ftnt9"">[9]</a></p><h2>Common knowledge ‘silver bullet arguments’</h2><p>Suppose one takes an introductory class in economics. From this, one sees there must be a ‘knock-down’ argument against a minimum wage:</p><p></p><blockquote>Well, suppose you’re an employee whose true value on the free market is less than the minimum wage. But under the minimum wage, the firm might not decide on charitably employing above your market value, and just firing you instead. You’re worse off, as you’re on the dole, and the firm’s worse off, as it has to meet its labour demand another way. Everyone’s lost! So much for the minimum wage!</blockquote><p></p><p>Yet one quickly discovers economists seem to be deeply divided over the merits of the minimum wage (as they are about most other things). See for example <a href=""https://www.google.com/url?q=https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/04/what-economists-think-about-raising-the-minimum-wage/&sa=D&ust=1509307926164000&usg=AFQjCNGbAMz7kbVUV2TVWacsumIxKcJQ3w"">this poll</a> suggesting 38 economic experts in the US are pretty evenly divided on whether the minimum wage would ‘hit’ employment for low-skill workers, and leant in favour of the minimum wage ‘all things considered’.</p><p></p><p>It seems risible to suppose these economists don’t know their economics 101. What seems much more likely is that they know other things that you don’t which make the minimum wage more reasonable than your jejune understanding of the subject suggests. One need not belabour which side the outside view strongly prefers.</p><p></p><p>Yet it is depressingly common for people to confidently hold that view X or Y is decisively refuted by some point or another, notwithstanding the fact this point is well known to the group of experts that nonetheless hold X or Y. Of course in some cases one really has touched on the decisive point the experts have failed to appreciate. More often, one is proclaiming that one is on the wrong side of the Dunning-Kruger effect.</p><h2>Debunking the expert class (but not you)</h2><p>To the litany of cases where (apparent) experts screwed up, we can add verses without end. So we might be inclined to debunk a particular ‘expert consensus’ due to some bias or irrationality we can identify. Thus, having seen there are no ‘real’ experts to help us, we must look at the object level case. </p><p></p><p>The key question is this: “How are you better?” And it is here that debunking attempts often flounder:</p><p></p><p>An undercutting defeater for one aspect of epistemic superiority for the expert class is not good enough. Maybe one can show the expert class has a poor predictive track record in their field. Unless one has a better track record in their field, this puts you on a par with respect to this desideratum of epistemic virtue. They likely have others (e.g. more relevant object-level knowledge) that should still give them an edge, albeit attenuated.</p><p></p><p>An undercutting defeater that seems to apply equally well to oneself as the expert class also isn’t enough. Suppose (say) economics is riven by ideological bias: why are you less susceptible to these biases? The same ideological biases that might plague professional economists may also plague amateur economists, but the former retain other advantages. </p><p></p><p>Even if a proposed debunking is ‘selectively toxic’ to the experts versus you, it still might be your epistemic superior all things considered. Both Big Pharma and Professional Philosophy may be misaligned, but perhaps not so much to be orthogonal or antiparallel to the truth: in both they still expectedly benefit by finding drugs that work or making good arguments respectively. They may still fare better overall than, “Intelligent layperson who’s read extensively”, even if they are not subject to ‘publish or perish’ or similar.</p><p></p><p>Even if a proposed debunking shows one as decisively superior to that expert class, there may be another expert class which remains epistemically superior to you. Maybe you can persuasively show professional philosophers are so compromised on consciousness that they should not be deferred to about it. Then the real expert class may simply switch to something like ‘intelligent people outside the academy who think a lot about the topic’. If it’s the case that this group of people do not share your confidence in your view, it seems outsiders should still reject it - as should you.</p><p></p><p>It need not be said that the track record for these debunking defeaters is poor. Most crackpots have a persecution narrative to explain why the mainstream doesn’t recognise or understand them, and some of the most mordant criticisms of the medical establishment arise from those touting complementary medicine. Thus ‘explaining away’ expert disagreement may not put one in a more propitious reference class than one started from. One should be particularly suspicious of debunking(s) sufficiently general that the person holding the unorthodox view has no epistemic peers - they are akin to Moses, descending from Mt. Sinai, bringing down God-breathed truth for the rest of us.<a href=""https://www.lesserwrong.com/editPost?postId=SJKowjkGF7z2sS98f#ftnt10"">[10]</a></p><h2>Private evidence and pet arguments</h2><p>Suppose one thinks one is in receipt of a powerful piece of private evidence: maybe you’ve got new data or a new insight. So even though the experts are generally in the right, in this particular case they are wrong because they are unaware of this new consideration.</p><p></p><p>New knowledge will not spread instantaneously, and that someone can be ‘ahead of the curve’ comes as no surprise. Yet many people who take themselves to have private evidence are wrong: maybe experts know about it but don’t bother to discuss it because it is so weak, or it is already in the literature (but you haven’t seen it), or it isn’t actually relevant to the topic, or whatever else. Most mavericks who take themselves to have new evidence that overturns consensus are mistaken.</p><p></p><p>The natural risk is people tend to be too partial to their pet arguments or pet data, and so give them undue weight, and so one’s ‘insider’ perceptions should perhaps be attenuated by this fact. I suspect most are overconfident here.<a href=""https://www.lesserwrong.com/editPost?postId=SJKowjkGF7z2sS98f#ftnt11"">[11]</a> If this private evidence really is powerful, one should expect it to be persuasive to members of this expert class once they become aware of it. So it seems the credence one should have is the (appropriately discounted) forecast of what the expert class would think once you provide them this evidence.</p><p></p><p>The natural test of the power of this private evidence is to make it public. If one observes experts (or just epistemic peers) shift to your view, you were right about how powerful this evidence was. If instead one sees a much more modest change in opinion, this should lead one to downgrade your estimate as to how powerful this evidence really is (and perhaps provide calibration data for next time). Holding instead this really is decisive evidence leads one to the problematic ‘common knowledge silver bullet’ case discussed above. Inferring from this experts just can’t understand your reasoning or are biased against outsiders or whatever else produces a suspiciously self-serving debunking argument, also discussed above.  </p><h1>Objections</h1><p>So much for the case in favour. What about the case against? I divide objections into those ‘in theory’, and those ‘in practice’. </p><h2>In theory</h2><h3>There’s no pure ‘outside view’<a href=""https://www.lesserwrong.com/editPost?postId=SJKowjkGF7z2sS98f#ftnt12"">[12]</a></h3><p>It is not the case you can bootstrap an outside view from nothing. One needs to at least start with some considerations as to what makes one an epistemic peer or superior, and probably some minimal background knowledge of ‘aboutness’ to place topics under one or another expert class. </p><p></p><p>In the same way large amounts of our empirical information are now derived by instrument rather than direct application of our senses (but were ultimately germinated from direct sensory experience), large amounts of our epistemic information can be derived by deferring to better (or more) brains rather than using our own, even if this relies on some initial seed epistemology we have to realise for ourselves. This ‘germinal set of claims’ can still be modestly revised later. </p><p></p><h3>Immodestly modest?</h3><p>One line of attack from the <a href=""https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02691728.2014.907833?journalCode%3Dtsep20&sa=D&ust=1509307926169000&usg=AFQjCNFAW4RfOXYif_Fz7fOiNY2kB2BYgA"">social epistemology literature</a> is that strong forms of modesty are self-defeating. If one is modest, one should assumedly be modest about ‘What is the right way to form beliefs if epistemic peers disagree with you?’ Yet one finds that very few people endorse the sort of epistemic modesty advocated above. When one looks among potential expert classes, such as more intelligent friends of mine (i.e. friends of mine), epistemologists, and so on, conciliatory views like these command only a minority. So the epistemically modest should vanish as they defer to the more steadfast consensus.</p><p></p><p>If so, so much the worse for modesty. I offer a couple of incomplete defences:</p><p></p><p>One is haggling over the topic of disagreement. In my limited reading of ‘equal weight/conciliatory views and their detractors’, I take the detractors to be suggesting something like “one is ‘within one’s rights’ to be steadfast”, rather than something like “you’re more accurate if you’re steadfast”. Maybe there are epistemic virtues which aren’t the same as being more accurate. Yet there may be less disagreement on ‘conditional on an accuracy first view, is modesty the right approach?’</p><p></p><p>This only gets so far (after all, shouldn’t we be modest whether only to care about accuracy?) A more general defence is this: the ‘what if you apply the theory to itself?’ problem looks pretty pervasive across theories.<a href=""https://www.lesserwrong.com/editPost?postId=SJKowjkGF7z2sS98f#ftnt13"">[13]</a> Accounts of moral uncertainty that in whatever sense involve weighing normative theories by their plausibility tend to run into problems if the same accounts are applied ‘one level up’ to meta-moral uncertainty. Bayesian accounts of epistemology seem to go haywire if we think one should have a credence in Bayesian epistemology itself, especially if one assigns any non-zero credence on any theory which entails object level credences have undefined values. </p><p></p><p>Closer to home, milder versions of conciliation (e.g. “Pay some attention to peer disagreement, but it’s not the only factor”) share a similarly troublesome recursive loop (“Well, I see most other people are steadfast, so I should update to be a bit less conciliatory, but now I have to apply my modified view to this disagreement again”) and neat convergence is not guaranteed. The theories which avoid this problem (e.g. ‘Wholly steadfast, so peer disagreement should be ignored’), tend to be the least plausible on the object level (e.g. That if you believe bins are on Thursday, the fact all your neighbours have their bins out on Tuesday is not even reason to reconsider your belief).</p><p></p><p>A solution to these types of problems remains elusive. Yet modesty finds itself in fairly good company. It may be the case that a good resolution to this type of issue would rule out the strong form of modesty advocated here, in favour of some intermediate view. Until then, I hope the (admittedly inelegant) “Be modest, save for meta-epistemic norms about modesty itself” is not too great a cost to bear across the scales from the merits of the approach.</p><h2>In practice</h2><p>I take most of the action to surround whether modesty makes sense as a practical procedure in the real world, even granting it’s ‘in theory’ virtue. Given the strength of modesty, I advocate, the fact we use something like it in some cases, and we can identify it can help in others, is not enough. It needs to be shown as a better strategy than even slightly weaker forms, in circumstances deliberately selected to pose the greatest challenge to strong modesty. </p><h3>Trivial (and less trivial) non-use cases</h3><p>For some topics there’s no relevant epistemic peers or superiors to consider. This is commonly the case with pretty trivial beliefs (e.g. my desk is yellow).</p><p></p><p>Modesty also doesn’t help much for individual tastes, idiosyncrasies, or circumstances. If Adam works best listening to Bach and Beatrice to Beethoven, they probably won’t do better ‘meeting in the middle’ and both going half-and-half for each (or maybe picking a composer intermediate in history, like Mozart). Anyway, Adam is probably Beatrice’s significant epistemic superior on “What music does Adam work best listening to?”, and vice-versa. One can also be credulous of claims like “It turned out this diet really helped my back pain”: perhaps it’s placebo, or perhaps it is one of those cases where different things work for different people, and one expects in such cases individuals to have privileged access to what worked for them.<a href=""https://www.lesserwrong.com/editPost?postId=SJKowjkGF7z2sS98f#ftnt14"">[14]</a> </p><p></p><p>There will be cases where one really is plowing a lonely furrow where there aren’t any close epistemic peers or superiors. It’s possible I really am the world’s leading expert on “How many counter-factual DALYs does a doctor avert during their career?”, because no one else has really looked into this question. My current role involves investigating global catastrophic biological risks, which appears understudied to the point of being pre-paradigmatic. </p><p></p><p>These comprise a very small minority of topics I have credences about. Yet even here modesty can help. One can use more distant bodies of experts: I am reassured that my autumnal estimate for the ‘DALY question’ coheres with expert consensus that medical practice had a minor role in improvements to human health, for example. Even if I don’t have any epistemic peers, I can simulate some by asking, “If there were lots of people as or more reasonable than me looking at this, would I expect them to agree with my take?” Given that the econometric-esque methods I deploy to the answer the ‘DALY question’ could probably be done better by an expert, and in any case reasonable people are often sceptical of these in other areas, I am less confident of my findings than my ‘inside view’ suggests, which I take to be a welcome corrective to ‘pet argument’ biases.<a href=""https://www.lesserwrong.com/editPost?postId=SJKowjkGF7z2sS98f#ftnt15"">[15]</a>  </p><h3>In theory, the world should be mad</h3><p>Whether devoured by Moloch, burned by Ra, trapped by aberrant signalling equilibria, or whatever else, we can expect to predict when apparent expert classes (and apparent epistemic peers) are going to collectively go wrong. With this knowledge, we can know which topics we should expect to ourselves to outperform expertise. Rather than the scenario where we commonly find ourselves looking up (at experts) or around (at our peers), we find ourselves in many situations where those who are usually epistemic peers or superiors are below us - and above us, only sky. </p><p></p><p>We could distinguish two sorts of madness, a surprising absence of expertise and a surprising error of expertise: </p><p></p><p>The former is a gap in the epistemic market. Although an important topic should be combed over by a body of experts, for whatever reason it isn’t, and so it takes surprisingly little effort to climb to the summit of epistemic superiority. In such cases our summaries of expert classes as ranging over a broad area conceal the degree of expertise is very patchy: public health experts generally know a great deal about the health impacts of smoking; they usually know much less about the health impacts of nicotine.</p><p></p><p>The latter is a stronger debunking argument. One appeals to some features of the world that generates expertise and suggests that these expertise generating features are anti-correlated to the truth, thus one can adjudicate between warring expert camps (or just indict all so-called ‘experts’) based on this knowledge. One strong predictor of incompatibilism regarding free will among is believing in God. If we are confident these beliefs in God are irrational, then we can winnow the expert class by this consideration and side with the compatibilist camp much more strongly. </p><p></p><p>Yet, similar to the problems of debunking mentioned earlier, that there is a good story suggesting one of these things does not imply one will do better ‘striking out on one&#x27;s own’. Even in cases of disease where accuracy is poorly correlated to expert activity, it is hard to think of cases where these line up orthogonal or worse. Big pharma studies are infamous, but even if you’re in big pharma optimising for ‘can I get evidence to support my product’, your drug actually working does make this easier. Even in pre-replication crisis psychology, true results would be overrepresented versus false ones in the literature compared to some base rate across generated hypotheses.</p><p></p><p>The ‘residual’ expert class still often remains better. Although most public health experts know little about nicotine per se, there are some nearby health experts, perhaps scattered across our common-sense demarcation of fields, who do know about the impacts of nicotine. It may still take quite a lot of <a href=""https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.gwern.net/Nicotine&sa=D&ust=1509307926174000&usg=AFQjCNGKDJ10pWROgwXPRXAYw-eWjwth-w"">effort</a> to reach parity or superiority to these. Even if we want to strike all theists from free will philosophers, compatibilism does not rise close to unanimity, and so cautions against extremely high confidence this is the correct view.<a href=""https://www.lesserwrong.com/editPost?postId=SJKowjkGF7z2sS98f#ftnt16"">[16]</a> So, I aver, the world is not that mad.</p><h3>Empirically, the world is mad</h3><p>One can offer a more direct demonstration of world madness, and so modesty: outperformance.</p><p></p><p>A common reply is to point to a particular case where those being modest would have gotten it wrong. There are lots of cases where amateurs and mavericks were ridiculed by common sense or experts-at-the-time, only to be subsequently vindicated.</p><p></p><p>Another problem is the modest view introduces a lag - it seems one often needs to wait for the new information to take root among one’s epistemic peers before changing one’s view, whilst a cogniser just relying on the object level updates on correct arguments ‘at first sight’. It is often crucially important to be fast as well as right in both empirical and moral matters: it is extremely costly if a view makes one slower to recognise (among many other past moral catastrophes) the horror of slavery.</p><p></p><p>Yet modesty need not infallible, merely an improvement. Citing cases where it goes poorly is (hopefully less than) half the story. Modesty does worse in cases the maverick is right, yet better where the maverick is wrong: there are more cases of the latter than the former. Modesty does worse in being sluggish in responding to moral revolutions, yet better at avoiding being swept away by waves of mistaken sentiment: again, the latter seem more common than the former.<a href=""https://www.lesserwrong.com/editPost?postId=SJKowjkGF7z2sS98f#ftnt17"">[17]</a></p><p></p><p>Maybe one can follow a strategy such that you can ‘pick the hits’ of when to carve out exceptions, and so have a superior track record. Yet, empirically, <a href=""https://www.google.com/url?q=http://lesswrong.com/lw/hol/a_personal_history_of_involvement_with_effective/986i&sa=D&ust=1509307926176000&usg=AFQjCNGcxgqHLX0BW2ouX3zh8q2qoWYvSQ"">I don’t see it</a>. When I look at people who are touted as particularly good at being ‘<a href=""https://www.google.com/url?q=http://lesswrong.com/lw/1kh/the_correct_contrarian_cluster/&sa=D&ust=1509307926176000&usg=AFQjCNGzN0yR9YZJQ7poti_OZIfaFRp29g"">correct contrarians</a>’, I see at best something like an ‘epistemic venture capitalist’ - their bold contrarian guesses are right more often than chance, but not right more often than not. They appear by my lights to be unable to judiciously ‘pick their battles’, staking out radical views in topics where there isn’t a good story as to why the experts would be getting this wrong (still less why they’re more likely to get it right). So although they do get big wins, the modal outcome of their contrarian take is a bust.<a href=""https://www.lesserwrong.com/editPost?postId=SJKowjkGF7z2sS98f#ftnt18"">[18]</a> </p><p></p><p>Modesty should price in the views of better-than-chance contrarians into how it weighs consensus. Confidence in a consensus view should fall if a good contrarian takes aim at it, but not so much one now takes the contrarian view oneself. If one happens to be a particularly successful contrarian one should follow the same approach: “I get these right surprisingly often, but I’m still wrong more often than not, so it might be worth it to look into this further to see if I can strike gold, but until then I should bank on the consensus view.”</p><h2>Expert groups are seldom in reflective equilibrium</h2><p>Even if modesty works well in the ideal case of a clearly identified ‘expert class’, it can get a lot messier in reality:</p><p></p><ol><li>Suppose one is in the early 1940s and asks, “Is there going to be explosives with many orders of magnitude more power than current explosives?” One can imagine if one consulted explosive experts (however we cash that out), their consensus would generally say ‘no’. If one was able to talk to the physicists working on the Manhattan project, they would say ‘yes’. Which one should an outside view believe?<a href=""https://www.lesserwrong.com/editPost?postId=SJKowjkGF7z2sS98f#ftnt19"">[19]</a></li><li>Most people believe god exists (the so called ‘<a href=""https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.newappsblog.com/2012/05/the-common-consent-argument-for-gods-existence-and-cognitive-science-of-religion.html&sa=D&ust=1509307926178000&usg=AFQjCNGUePiUINo-pQHCwbegLKv5iW-d_g"">common consent argument</a> for God’s existence’); if one looks at potential expert classes (e.g. philosophers, people who are more intelligent), most of them are Atheists. Yet if one looks at philosophers of religion (who spend a lot of time on arguments for or against God’s existence), most of them are Theists - but maybe there’s a <a href=""https://www.google.com/url?q=http://crucialconsiderations.org/rationality/theism-and-expert-knowledge/&sa=D&ust=1509307926178000&usg=AFQjCNHkRddXIUlqSw9HrBMy92qeZAUJDQ"">gradient</a> within them too. Which group, exactly, should be weighed most heavily?</li></ol><p></p><p>So constructing the ideal ‘weighted consensus’ modesty recommends deferring to can become a pretty involved procedure. One must carefully divine whether a given topic lies closer to the magisterium of one or another putative expert class (e.g. maybe one should lean more to the physicists, as the question is really more ‘about physics’ than ‘about explosives’). One might have to carefully weigh up the relevant epistemic virtues of various expert classes that appear far from reflective equilibrium from one another (so perhaps one might use likely selection effect of philosophy of religion party discount the apparent support this provides). One might have to delve into complicated issues of independence: although most people may believe god exists, unlike guesses of how many skittles are in the jar, they are not all forming this belief independently from one another.<a href=""https://www.lesserwrong.com/editPost?postId=SJKowjkGF7z2sS98f#ftnt20"">[20]</a></p><p></p><p>This exercise begins to look increasingly insider-view-esque. Trying to determine the right magisterium involves getting closer to object level considerations about ‘aboutness’ of topics; trying to tease apart issues of independence and selection amount to looking at belief forming practices, and veer close to object level justifications for the belief in question. At some point it becomes extraordinarily challenging to try and back-trace from all these factors to the likely position of the ideal observer: the degrees of freedom these considerations invite (and the challenge in estimating them reliably) make strong modesty go worse.</p><p></p><p>One should not give up too early, though: modesty can still work pretty well even in these tricky cases. One can ask whether there’s any communication between the classes, and if so any direction of travel (e.g. did some explosive experts end up talking to the physicists, and agreeing they were right? Vice-versa?), even if they were completely isolated, one can ask if a third group having access to both made a decision (e.g. the agreement of the U.S. and German governments with the implied view of the physicists). This is a lot more involved, but the expected ‘accuracy yield per unit time spent’ may still be greater than (for example) making a careful study of the relevant physics. </p><p></p><p>A broader modification would be ‘immodest only for the web of belief, but modest for the weights’: one uses an inside view to piece together the graph of considerations around P, but one still defers to consensus on the weights. This may avoid cases where (for example) strong modesty may mistake astronomers as the expert class for about space travel being infeasible (versus primordial rocket scientists), even though astronomers and rocket scientists agreed about the necessary acceleration, but astronomers were inexpert on the key question as to whether that explanation could be produced.<a href=""https://www.lesserwrong.com/editPost?postId=SJKowjkGF7z2sS98f#ftnt21"">[21]</a></p><p></p><p>What if one cannot even do that? Then modestly (rightly) offers a counsel of despair. If an area is so fractious there’s no agreement, with no way to see which of numerous of disparate camps have better access the truth of the matter; so suffused with bias that even those with apparent epistemic virtues (e.g. judgement, intelligence, subject-matter knowledge) cannot be seen to even tend towards the truth; what hope does one have to do better than they? In attempting to thread the needle through these hazards towards the right judgement, one will almost certainly run aground somewhere or somehow, alike all one&#x27;s epistemic peers or superiors who made the attempt before. Perhaps reality obliges us to undertake these doxastic suicide missions from time to time. If modesty cannot help us, it can at least provide the solace of a pre-emptive funeral, rather than (as immodest views would) cheer us on to our almost certain demise. </p><h4>Somewhat satisfying Shulman  </h4><p>Carl Shulman encourages me to offer my credences and rationale in cases he takes to be particularly difficult for my view, and suggests in these cases I either arrive at absurd credences or I am covertly abandoning the strong modesty approach. I offer these below for readers to decide - with the rider that if these are in fact absurd, ‘I’m an idiot’ is a competing explanation to ‘strong modesty is a bad epistemic practice’ (and that, assuredly, whatever one’s credence on the latter, one’s credence in the former should be far greater).</p><p></p><p><em>Proposition (roughly)</em>; <strong>Credence (ish)</strong>; (Modesty-based) rationale, in sketch</p><p><em>Theism</em>; <strong>0.1</strong><a href=""https://www.lesserwrong.com/editPost?postId=SJKowjkGF7z2sS98f#ftnt22"">[22]; </a>Mostly discount common consent (non-independence) and PoR (selection). Major hits from more intelligent people/ better informed tend to be atheist, but struggle to extrapolate this closer to 0 given existence proofs of very epistemically virtuous religious people. </p><p><em>Libertarian free will</em>; <strong>0.1</strong>; Commands a non-trivial minority across virtuous epistemic classes (philosophers, intelligent people, etc), only somewhat degraded by selection worries. </p><p><em>Jesus rose from the dead</em>; <strong>0.005</strong>; Christianity in particular a very small fraction of possibility space of Theism. Support from its widespread support is mostly (but not wholly) screened off by non-independence effects. Relevant (but distant) expert classes in history etc. weigh adversely.</p><p><em>There has been a case of cold fusion</em>; <strong>10^-5</strong>; Strong pan scientific consensus against, cold fusion community looks renegade and much less epistemically virtuous. Base rate of these conditional on no effect gives very adverse reference class.</p><p><em>ESP</em>; <strong>10^-6</strong>; Very strong (but non-complete) trophism among elite common sense, scientists, etc; bad predictive track records for ESP researchers; distant consensuses highly adverse. Some greatly attenuated boost from survey data/small fraction of reasonable believers.</p><h3>Practical challenges to immodesty</h3><p>Modesty can lead to double-counting, or even groupthink. Suppose in the original example Beatrice does what I suggest and revise their credences to be 0.6, but Adam doesn’t. Now Charlie forms his own view (say 0.4 as well) and does the same procedure as Beatrice, so Charlie now holds a credence of 0.6 as well. The average should be lower: (0.8+0.4+0.4)/3, not (0.8+0.6+0.4)/3, but the results are distorted by using one-and-a-half helpings of Adam’s credence. With larger cases one can imagine people wrongly deferring to hold consensus around a view they should think is implausible, and in general the nigh-intractable challenge from trying to infer cases of double counting from the patterns of ‘all things considered’ evidence.</p><p></p><p>One can rectify this by distinguishing ‘credence by my lights’ versus ‘credence all things considered’. So one can say “Well, by my lights the credence of P is 0.8, but my actual credence is 0.6, once I account for the views of my epistemic peers etc.” Ironically, one’s personal ‘inside view’ of the evidence is usually the most helpful credence to publicly report (as it helps others modestly aggregate), whilst ones all things considered modest view usually for private consumption.</p><h3>Community benefits to immodesty</h3><p>Modesty could be parasitic on a community level. If one is modest, one need never trouble oneself with any ‘object level’ considerations at all, and simply cultivate the appropriate weighting of consensuses to defer to. If everyone free-rode like that, no one would discover any new evidence, have any new ideas, and so collectively stagnate.<a href=""https://www.lesserwrong.com/editPost?postId=SJKowjkGF7z2sS98f#ftnt23"">[23]</a> Progress only happens if people get their hands dirty on the object-level matters of the world, try to build models, and make some guesses - sometimes the experts have gotten it wrong, and one won’t ever find that out by deferring to them based on the fact they usually get it right.<a href=""https://www.lesserwrong.com/editPost?postId=SJKowjkGF7z2sS98f#ftnt24"">[24]</a> </p><p></p><p>The distinction between ‘credence by my lights’ versus ‘credence all things considered’ allows the best of both worlds. One can say ‘by my lights, P’s credence is X’ yet at the same time ‘all things considered though, I take P’s credence to be Y’. One can form one’s own model of P, think the experts are wrong about P, and marshall evidence and arguments for why you are right and they are wrong; yet soberly realise that the chances are you are more likely mistaken; yet also think this effort is nonetheless valuable because even if one is most likely heading down a dead-end, the corporate efforts of people like you promises a good chance of someone finding a better path.</p><p></p><p>Scott Sumner seems to do something <a href=""https://www.google.com/url?q=http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2016/05/why_bryan_capla_1.html&sa=D&ust=1509307926189000&usg=AFQjCNF5rY2Mxms4Sy4vpDJcJfhr-01iPA"">similar</a>:</p><p></p><blockquote>In macro, it&#x27;s important for people like me to always search for the truth, and reach conclusions about economic models in a way that is independent of the consensus model.

If we are made dictator, we should implement the consensus view of optimal policy, not our own. People have trouble with this, as it implies two levels of belief about what is true.

I close on these remarks.</p><h2>Rationalist/EA exceptionalism </h2><p>Both communities endure a steady ostinato of complaints about arrogance. They’ve got a point. I despair of seeing some wannabe-iconoclast spout off about how obviously the solution to some famously recondite issue is X and the supposed experts who disagree obviously just need to better understand the ‘tenets of EA’ or the sequences. I become lachrymose when further discussion demonstrates said iconoclast has a shaky grasp of the basics, that they are recapitulating points already better-discussed in the literature, and so forth.<a href=""https://www.lesserwrong.com/editPost?postId=SJKowjkGF7z2sS98f#ftnt25"">[25]</a></p><p></p><p>To stress (and to pre-empt), the problem is not, “You aren’t kowtowing appropriately to social status!” The problem is considerable over-confidence married with inadequate understanding.

Paper&#x27;s full of them.</blockquote><blockquote>In any case, you read with exasperation or amusement the multiple errors in a story, and then turn the page to national or international affairs, and read as if the rest of the newspaper was somehow more accurate about Palestine than the baloney you just read. You turn the page, and forget what you know.</blockquote><p>Gell-Mann cases invite inferring adverse judgements based on extrapolating from in instance of poor performance. When experts in multiple different subjects say the same thing (i.e. Murray and Crichton chatted to an expert on Palestine who had the same impression), this adverse inference gets all the stronger. </p><p></p><p>I think we have information some to many pieces of work or corporate projects in our community share this property: that although it might look good or groundbreaking to us as relatively less-informed, domain experts in the fields it touches upon tend to report the work is misguided or rudimentary. Although it is possible to indict all these judgements, akin to a person who gives very adverse accounts of all of their previous romantic partners, we may start to wonder about a common factor explanation. Our collective ego is writing checks our epistemic performance (or, in candour, performance generally) cannot cash; general ignorance, rather than particular knowledge, may explain our self-regard.</p><h2>To discover, not summarise</h2><p>It is thought that to make the world go better new things need to be discovered, above and beyond making sound judgements on existing knowledge. Quickly making accurate determinations of the balance of reason for a given issue is greatly valuable for the latter, but not so much for the former.</p><p></p><p>Yet the two should not be confused. If one writes a short overview of a subject ‘for internal consumption’ which gives a fairly good impression of what a particular view should be, one should not be too worried if a specialist complains that you haven’t covered all the topics as adequately as one might. However, if one is aiming to write something which articulates an insight or understanding not just novel to the community, but novel to the world, one should be extremely concerned if domain experts review this work and say things along the lines of, “Well, this is sort of a potted recapitulation of work in our field, and this insight is widely discussed”.</p><p></p><p>Yet I see this happen a lot to things we tout as ‘breakthrough discoveries’. We want to avoid case where we waste our time in unwitting recapitulation, or fail to catch elementary mistakes. Yet too often we license ourselves to pronounce these discoveries without sufficient modesty in cases where there’s already a large expert community working on similar matters. This does not preclude these discoveries, but it cautions us to carefully check first. On occasions where I take myself to have a new insight in areas outside my field (most often philosophy), I am extremely suspect of my supposed discovery: all too often would this arise from my misunderstanding, or already be in the literature somewhere I haven’t looked. I carefully consult the literature as best as I can, and run the idea by true domain experts, to rule out these possibilities.<a href=""https://www.lesserwrong.com/editPost?postId=SJKowjkGF7z2sS98f#ftnt27"">[27]</a> </p><p></p><p>Others seem to lack this modesty, and so predictably err. More generally, a more modest view of ‘intra-community versus outside competence’ may also avoid cases of having to reinvent the wheel (e.g. that scoring rule you spent six months deriving for a karma system is in this canonical paper), or for an effort to derail (e.g. oh drat, our evaluation provides worthless data because of reasons we could have known from googling ‘study design’).</p><h2>Paradoxically pathological modesty </h2><p>If the EA and rationalist communities comprised a bunch of highly overconfident and eccentric people buzzing around bumping their pet theories together, I may worry about overall judgement and how much novel work gets done, but I would at grant this at least looks like fertile ground for new ideas to be developed.</p><p></p><p>Alas, not so much. What occurs instead is agreement approaching fawning obeisance to a small set of people the community anoints as ‘thought leaders’, and so centralizing on one particular eccentric and overconfident view.<a href=""https://www.lesserwrong.com/editPost?postId=SJKowjkGF7z2sS98f#ftnt28"">[28]</a> So although we may preach immodesty on behalf of the wider community, our practice within it is much more deferential.</p><p></p><p>I hope a better understanding of modesty can get us out of this ‘worst of both worlds’ scenario. One, it can at least provide better ‘gurus’ to defer to. Modesty also helps in correcting the overly wide gap we have between our gurus and other experts, and the overly narrow gap between ‘intelligent layperson in the community’ and ‘someone able to contribute to the state of the art on a topic of interest. Some topics are really hard: being able to become someone with ‘something useful to say’ about these not take days but take years; there are many deep problems we must concern ourselves with; that the few we select as champions, despite their virtue, cannot do them all alone; and that we need all the outside help we can get.</p><h2>Coda</h2><p>What the EA community mainly has now is a briar-patch of dilettantes: each ranges widely, but with shallow roots, forming whorls around others where it deems it can find support. What it needs is a forest of experts: each spreading not so widely; forming a deeper foundation and gathering more resources from the common ground; standing apart yet taller, and in concert producing a verdant canopy.<a href=""https://www.lesserwrong.com/editPost?postId=SJKowjkGF7z2sS98f#ftnt29"">[29]</a> I hope this transformation occurs, and aver modesty may help effect it.</p><p></p><h1>Acknowledgements</h1><p>I thank Joseph Carlsmith, Owen Cotton-Barratt, Eric Drexler, Ben Garfinkel, Roxanne Heston, Will MacAskill, Ben Pace, Stefan Schubert, Carl Shulman, and Pablo Stafforini for their helpful discussion, remarks, and criticism.

If Adam knows this, he can adjust and become unbiased, if Oliver or Beatrice knows this (and knows Adam doesn’t), the break the peerhood for Adam but can simulate unbiased Adam* which would remain a peer, and act accordingly. If none of them know this, then it is the case that Beatrice wins, as does Oliver following a non-averaging ‘go with Beatrice’ strategy. Yet this is simply epistemic luck: without information, all reasonable prior distribution candidates of (Adam’s bias - Beatrice’s bias) are symmetrical about 0.   </p><p><a href=""https://www.lesserwrong.com/editPost?postId=SJKowjkGF7z2sS98f#ftnt_ref7"">[7]</a> Another benefit of modesty is speed: Although it is the case Adam and Beatrice’s credence (and thus the average) gets more accurate if they have time to discuss it, and so catch one another if they make a mistake or reveal previously-private evidence, averaging is faster and the trade-off in time for better precision may not be worth it. It still remains the case, as per the first example, that they still do better, after this discussion, if they meet in the middle on residual disagreement. </p><p><a href=""https://www.lesserwrong.com/editPost?postId=SJKowjkGF7z2sS98f#ftnt_ref8"">[8]</a> A further (albeit minor and technical) dividend is that although individual guesses may form any distribution (for which the standard deviation may not be a helpful summary), the central limit theorem applies to the average of guesses distribution, so it tends to normality.  </p><p><a href=""https://www.lesserwrong.com/editPost?postId=SJKowjkGF7z2sS98f#ftnt_ref9"">[9]</a> Even if one is the world authority, there should be some deference to lesser experts.

Very volatile credences may represent the buffeting of a degree of belief by evidence large relative to one&#x27;s prior - but it may also represent poor calibration in overweighing new evidence (and vice versa). The ‘ideal’ response in terms of accuracy is given by standard theory.

No sports knowledge required.</p><p>In 2005, Willie Randolph became manager of the New York Mets.</p><p>In his first five games as manager, all of which he lost, Willie made more decisions wrong than I thought possible. If he needed to change pitchers, he waited. Other times he changed pitchers for no reason. Starting lineups made zero sense. Position players bunted. And so on. He cost us <em>at least</em> one of those games. My friend Seth and called for Willie’s head.</p><p>He would go on to an excellent 97 win season in 2006, come in second in manager-of-the-year voting, get a contract extension, and only get fired after wearing out our starting pitchers so much that we experienced one of the most epic late season collapses in baseball history in 2007, followed by a horrible 2008.</p><p>Willie’s in-game decisions did not improve. If anything, they got worse.</p><p>Despite this, we came to understand why Willie got and kept his job.</p><p>Willie Randolph was a leader of men.</p><p>Players liked Willie. They wanted to play for him, work hard for him, be the best they could be. They put the team first. He created a positive clubhouse atmosphere. He inspired good performances, spotted ways players could improve.</p><p><em>That </em>is what counts.</p><p>Do bad in-game decisions cost games? Absolutely. But not <em>that many </em>games. Maybe they lose you 4 a year out of 162.</p><p>If the lineup makes your players unhappy, that costs a lot more. If your pitchers lose motivation or have their rhythms disrupted, that matters more than getting high leverage for your best reliever. Maybe bunting inspires team unity. The reason we hate bunting so much isn’t because it’s a <em>huge </em>mistake. It’s an <em>obvious </em>mistake. A <em>pure </em>mistake. An arithmetic error.</p><p>Plenty of people could get those technical decisions right. I could do it.</p><p>What most of us <em>can’t </em>do is lead men. Leading men <em>is what counts. </em>That’s the real job, but it <em>comes with </em>these other tasks.</p><p>Sometimes these other tasks land in good hands, at other times they land in terrible hands. Those who do the little things right do succeed more, but you can still win championships without them. If you can lead men.</p><p>Other sports follow the pattern. Why do football teams employ Andy Reid, who could not manage a two-minute drill if his life depended on it? Why do highly successful basketball players refuse to cooperate with their teammates or practice key skills?</p><p>Because those are small mistakes. The things those people do right matter more.</p><p>Could Willie Randolph hire someone to micromanage the game? Could Andy Reid hire someone to manage his two minute drills?</p><p>No. The people who are capable of that, are not leaders of men, and how they make those decisions is part of how they lead men.</p><p>Even if you <em>could </em>do that, <em>fixing such penny-ante problems is too disruptive.</em> You want their eyes on the prize. </p><p>This generalizes.</p><p>If a position calls for a leader of men, you often find a leader of men. If it requires super high levels of another skill, whether it’s coding, raising money, lifting weights, intricate chemistry or proving theorems, you’ll find that. However, if you need <em>rare </em>levels of such skills compared to what you can offer,  you won’t select <em>for anything else. </em>You can’t demand <em>ordinary competence </em>in insufficiently important areas. There aren’t enough qualified applicants. Plus it wouldn’t be worth the distraction.</p><p>This helps explain why people in unique positions are often <em>uniquely terrible. </em>They’re not replaceable. Some incompetence and shenanigans are acceptable, so long as they deliver the goods.</p><p>The same goes for other groups, organizations, religions, software and most anything else.</p><p>If a system has <em>unique big advantages,</em> they’re not effectively competing on less big things. They <em>might </em>be optimizing small things, but they don’t have to, so you can’t assume such things are optimized at all. Even when a system does not have unique advantages, anything <em>insufficiently central </em>is likely not optimized because it’s not worthy of attention.</p><p>It is <em>much, much easier </em>to pick out a way in which a system is sub-optimal, than it is to implement or run that system at anything like its current level of optimization.</p><p>Thus I generally believe the following two things:</p><p>It is relatively easy to find ways in which almost anything could be improved on the margin, were one able to implement isolated changes. Well thought-out such ideas are often correct.</p><p>and also</p><p>The person making such a correct suggestion would likely be hopelessly lost trying to implement this change let alone running the relevant systems.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>",Zvi,zvi,Zvi,

I often think of karma as the System 1 of the site, and the mods as the System 2 - while S1 makes most decisions and sets up basic incentive gradients, S2 tries to give useful input on important decisions, make plans and route around obstacles. I expect the S1 to be imperfect - as an example, I imagine some posts will be undervalued that dont&#x27; contain many new ideas but summarise a great deal of previous discussion well, so that people can read a single post instead of 5 posts and 3 long comment threads. Recently I Featured one or two posts in part for being no longer than they needed to be, which I want authors to know is great, but I also don&#x27;t know that the karma system is incentivising as much.</p><p>A related key point is that only the S2 can be easily queried for its reasons - if you ask the karma system why it promoted something, it can&#x27;t tell you, and so authors have to speculate on why their posts got into Featured. I&#x27;m very pro transparency.</p><p>In general while I think the karma system is very useful and I take guidance from it a lot, I want the key decisions on the site not to be made by an algorithm whose parameters we do not know and cannot easily query (I mean, I can imagine having everyone on the site vote on certain questions to get answers about particular decisions, but this is very costly and can&#x27;t be done very regularly).</p><p>(Also, at the minute the moderation team is quite quiet, and what&#x27;s been promoted to Featured has largely been a function of my thoughts and the people I talk to most - Ray and Oliver. This is mostly because we haven&#x27;t given the mods most of their tools yet, but I expect when the team is more active and a wider section of the community is adding posts to Featured, this will allow many theories of what is valuable to flourish and coexist - like the karma system itself, only more transparent.)</p><p>Added: I like people to know the norms so I&#x27;ll leave this here for now, but if folks would like to discuss this Meta topic more, totally make a Meta post about it and discuss in that section of the site.</p>",Benito,benito,Ben Pace,

If you are walking with someone who looks at the $20 bill from a far and obviously dismisses it as fake, while you are considering going to pick it up, then you might want to think why she is doing this.  It may be she is trying to convince you not to go and pick it up, so she has a shot at it later. So Deceit.</p><p>If you see a scientist, hired by the people that run the subway,  walking close past the $20. When asked they may say, &quot; I thought it is likely to be fake due to an blog post I read by Eliezer&quot;.  But sub-conciously they might be factoring in the disruption to the flow of people it would cause if they bent  down to investigate the $20 dollars, so the &quot;Eliezer Post&quot; was not their true reason. So Motivated Reasoning. </p><p>These are small scale examples of reasons to distrust the apparent and reported beliefs of others. They can also apply to society at large.  Advertising and Lobbying can shift public opinion away from the truth. An example of this is <a href=""https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2548255"">sugar lobbying , </a>So you shouldn&#x27;t necessarily trust majoritarianism if people are being swayed by experts and those experts have non-truth seeking incentive structures.</p><p>Taken to the extreme this can cause paranoia. It is worth trying to look at the experts and seeing how big the incentives are for believing what they do. To take a non-real world example,  if all the experts studying sugar are employed by sugar manufacturers and would lose their jobs if sugar became significantly less popular, then they have strong incentives to say sugar is not dangerous (whether through deceit or motivated reasoning).  If all the experts on sugar are generic food health scientists who had tenure and could easily switch to studying some other food stuff if sugar went down in popularity, then they don&#x27;t have huge incentives to say sugar is better than it is (apart from things like <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/o2k/flinching_away_from_truth_is_often_about/"">protecting the epistemology</a>).</p><p>This doesn&#x27;t mean you are any more right about the things you believe. You also probably have non-truth seeking incentive structures in your life. If epistemic rationality is important to you, it is probably best to try and minimise those structures you get enmeshed in.</p>",,,,

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a book about two incompatible views on the age-old question: &ldquo;When should I think that I may be able to do something <em>unusually well</em>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>These two viewpoints tend to give wildly different, nearly <em>cognitively nonoverlapping</em> analyses of questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>My doctor says I need to eat less and exercise, but a lot of educated-sounding economics bloggers are talking about this thing called the &ldquo;Shangri-La Diet.&rdquo; They&rsquo;re saying that in order to lose weight, all you need to do is consume large quantities of flavorless, high-calorie foods at particular times of day; and they claim some amazing results with this diet. <em>Could they really know better than my doctor? Would I be able to tell if they did?</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>My day job is in artificial intelligence and decision theory. And I recall the dark days before 2015, when there was plenty of effort and attention going into advancing the state of the art in AI capabilities, but almost none going into AI alignment: better understanding AI designs and goals that can safely scale with capabilities. Though interest in the alignment problem has since increased quite a bit, it still makes sense to ask whether <em>at the time</em> I should have inferred from the lack of academic activity that there was no productive work to be done here; since <em>if there were reachable fruits, wouldn&rsquo;t academics be taking them</em>?<br/></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Should I try my hand at becoming an entrepreneur? Whether or not it should be difficult to spot promising ideas in a scientific field, it certainly can&rsquo;t be easy to think up a profitable idea for a new startup. <em>Will I be able to find any good ideas that aren&rsquo;t already taken?</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The effective altruism community is a network of philanthropists and researchers that try to find the very best ways to benefit others per dollar, in full generality. Where should effective altruism organizations like GiveWell expect to find low-hanging fruit&mdash;neglected interventions ripe with potential? <em>Where should they look to find things that our civilization isn&rsquo;t already doing about as well as can be done?</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When I think about problems like these, I use what feels to me like a natural generalization of the economic idea of efficient markets. The goal is to predict what kinds of efficiency we should expect to exist in realms beyond the marketplace, and what we can deduce from simple observations. For lack of a better term, I will call this kind of thinking <em>inadequacy analysis.</em></p>
<p>Toward the end of this book, I&rsquo;ll try to refute an alternative viewpoint that is increasingly popular among some of my friends, one that I think is ill-founded. This viewpoint is the one I&rsquo;ve previously termed &ldquo;modesty,&rdquo; and the message of modesty tends to be: &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t expect to be able to do <em>X</em> that isn&rsquo;t usually done, since you could just be deluding yourself into thinking you&rsquo;re better than other people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll open with a cherry-picked example that I think helps highlight the difference between these two viewpoints.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id=""i"">i.</h2>
<p>I once wrote a report, &ldquo;<a href=""https://intelligence.org/files/IEM.pdf"">Intelligence Explosion Microeconomics</a>,&rdquo; that called for an estimate of the economic growth rate in a fully developed country&mdash;that is, a country that is no longer able to improve productivity just by importing well-tested innovations. A footnote of the paper remarked that even though Japan was the country with the most advanced technology&mdash;e.g., their cellphones and virtual reality technology were five years ahead of the rest of the world&rsquo;s&mdash;I wasn&rsquo;t going to use Japan as my estimator for developed economic growth, because, as I saw it, Japan&rsquo;s monetary policy was utterly deranged.</p>
<p>Roughly, Japan&rsquo;s central bank wasn&rsquo;t creating enough money. I won&rsquo;t go into details here.</p>
<p>A friend of mine, and one of the most careful thinkers I know&mdash;let&rsquo;s call him &ldquo;John&rdquo;&mdash;made a comment on my draft to this effect:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How do you claim to know this? I can think of plenty of other reasons why Japan could be in a slump: the country&rsquo;s shrinking and aging population, its low female workplace participation, its high levels of product market regulation, etc. It looks like you&rsquo;re venturing outside of your area of expertise to no good end.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;How do you claim to know this?&rdquo; is a very reasonable question here. As John later elaborated, macroeconomics is an area where data sets tend to be thin and predictive performance tends to be poor. And John had previously observed me making contrarian claims where I&rsquo;d turned out to be badly wrong, like endorsing Gary Taubes&rsquo; theories about the causes of the obesity epidemic. More recently, John won money off of me by betting that AI performance on certain metrics would improve faster than I expected; John has a good track record when it comes to spotting my mistakes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also easy to imagine reasons an observer might have been skeptical. I wasn&rsquo;t making up my critique of Japan myself; I was reading other economists and deciding that I trusted the ones who were saying that the Bank of Japan was doing it wrong&hellip; &hellip; Yet one would expect the governing board of the Bank of Japan to be composed of experienced economists with specialized monetary expertise. How likely is it that any outsider would be able to spot an obvious flaw in their policy? How likely is it that someone who isn&rsquo;t a professional economist (e.g., me) would be able to judge which economic critiques of the Bank of Japan were correct, or which critics were wise?</p>
<p>How likely is it that an entire country&mdash;one of the world&rsquo;s most advanced countries&mdash;would forego trillions of dollars of real economic growth because their monetary controllers&mdash;not politicians, but appointees from the professional elite&mdash;were doing something so wrong that even a non-professional could tell? How likely is it that a non-professional could not just suspect that the Bank of Japan was doing something badly wrong, but be <em>confident</em> in that assessment?</p>
<p>Surely it would be more <em>realistic</em> to search for possible reasons why the Bank of Japan might not be as stupid as it seemed, as stupid as some econbloggers were claiming. Possibly Japan&rsquo;s aging population made growth impossible. Possibly Japan&rsquo;s massive outstanding government debt made even the slightest inflation too dangerous. Possibly we just aren&rsquo;t thinking of the complicated reasoning going into the Bank of Japan&rsquo;s decision.</p>
<p>Surely some <em>humility</em> is appropriate when criticizing the elite decision-makers governing the Bank of Japan. What if it&rsquo;s you, and not the professional economists making these decisions, who have failed to grasp the relevant economic considerations?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll refer to this genre of arguments as &ldquo;modest epistemology.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In conversation, John clarified to me that he rejects this genre of arguments; but I hear these kinds of arguments fairly often. The head of an effective altruism organization once gave voice to what I would consider a good example of this mode of thinking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I find it helpful to admit to unpleasant facts that will necessarily be true in the abstract, in order to be more willing to acknowledge them in specific cases. For instance, I should expect a priori to be below average at half of things, and be 50% likely to be of below average talent overall; to know many people who I regard as better than me according to my values; to regularly make decisions that look silly ex post, and also ex ante; to be mistaken about issues on which there is expert disagreement about half of the time; to perform badly at many things I attempt for the first time; and so on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Dunning-Kruger effect shows that unskilled individuals often rate their own skill very highly. Specifically, although there does tend to be a correlation between how competent a person is and how competent they <em>guess</em> they are, this correlation is weaker than one might suppose. In the original study, people in the bottom two quartiles of actual test performance tended to think they did better than about 60% of test-takers, while people in the top two quartiles tended to think they did better than 70% of test-takers.</p>
<p>This suggests that a typical person&rsquo;s guesses about how they did on a test are evidence, but not particularly powerful evidence: the top quartile is underconfident in how well they did, and the bottom quartiles are highly overconfident.</p>
<p>Given all that, how can we gain much evidence from our belief that we are skilled? Wouldn&rsquo;t it be more prudent to remind ourselves of the base rate&mdash;the prior probability of 50% that we are below average?</p>
<p>Reasoning along similar lines, software developer Hal Finney has endorsed &ldquo;abandoning personal judgment on most matters in favor of the majority view.&rdquo; Finney notes that the <em>average</em> person&rsquo;s opinions would be more accurate (on average) if they simply deferred to the most popular position on as many issues as they could. For this reason:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I choose to adopt the view that in general, on most issues, the average opinion of humanity will be a better and less biased guide to the truth than my own judgment.</p>
<p>[&hellip;] I would suggest that although one might not always want to defer to the majority opinion, it should be the default position. Rather than starting with the assumption that one&rsquo;s own opinion is right, and then looking to see if the majority has good reasons for holding some other view, one should instead start off by following the majority opinion; and then only adopt a different view for good and convincing reasons. On most issues, the default of deferring to the majority will be the best approach. If we accept the principle that &ldquo;extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence&rdquo;, we should demand a high degree of justification for departing from the majority view. The mere fact that our own opinion seems sound would not be enough.<sup><a href=""#footnote-1-definition"" name=""footnote-1-return"">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this way, Finney hopes to correct for overconfidence and egocentric biases.</p>
<p>Finney&rsquo;s view is an extreme case, but helps illustrate a pattern that I believe can be found in some more moderate and widely endorsed views. When I speak of &ldquo;modesty,&rdquo; I have in mind a fairly diverse set of positions that rest on a similar set of arguments and motivations.</p>
<p>I once heard an Oxford effective altruism proponent crisply summarize what I take to be the central argument for this perspective: &ldquo;You see that someone says <em>X</em>, which seems wrong, so you conclude their epistemic standards are bad. But they could just see that you say <em>Y</em>, which sounds wrong to them, and conclude your epistemic standards are bad.&rdquo;<sup><a href=""#footnote-2-definition"" name=""footnote-2-return"">2</a></sup> On this line of thinking, you don&rsquo;t get any information about who has better epistemic standards merely by observing that someone disagrees with you. After all, the other side observes just the same fact of disagreement.</p>
<p>Applying this argument form to the Bank of Japan example: I receive little or no evidence just from observing that the Bank of Japan says &ldquo;<em>X</em>&rdquo; when I believe &ldquo;not <em>X</em>.&rdquo; I also can&rsquo;t be getting strong evidence from any object-level impression I might have that I am unusually competent. So did my priors imply that I and I alone ought to have been born with awesome powers of discernment? (Modest people have posed this exact question to me on more than one occasion.)</p>
<p>It should go without saying that this isn&rsquo;t how I would explain my own reasoning. But if I reject arguments of the form, &ldquo;We disagree, therefore I&rsquo;m right and you&rsquo;re wrong,&rdquo; how can I claim to be correct on an economic question where I disagree with an institution as reputable as the Bank of Japan?</p>
<p>The other viewpoint, opposed to modesty&mdash;the view that I think is prescribed by normative epistemology (and also by more or less mainstream microeconomics)&mdash;requires a somewhat longer introduction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id=""ii"">ii.</h2>
<p>By ancient tradition, every explanation of the Efficient Markets Hypothesis must open with the following joke:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Two economists are walking along the street, and one says, &ldquo;Hey, someone dropped a $20 bill!&rdquo; and the other says, &ldquo;Well, it can&rsquo;t be a real $20 bill because someone would have picked it up already.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also by ancient tradition, the next step of the explanation is to remark that while it may make sense to pick up a $20 bill you see on a relatively deserted street, if you think you have spotted a $20 bill lying on the floor of Grand Central Station (the main subway nexus of New York City), and it has stayed there for several hours, then it probably <em>is</em> a fake $20 bill, or it has been glued to the ground.</p>
<p>In real life, when I asked a group of twenty relatively young people how many of them had ever found a $20 bill on the street, five raised their hands, and only one person had found a $20 bill on the street on two separate occasions. So the empirical truth about the joke is that while $20 bills on the street do exist, they&rsquo;re rare.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the implied policy is that if you do find a $20 bill on the street, you should go ahead and pick it up, because that does happen. It&rsquo;s not <em>that</em> rare. You certainly shouldn&rsquo;t start agonizing over whether it&rsquo;s too arrogant to believe that you have better eyesight than everyone else who has recently walked down the street.</p>
<p>On the other other hand, you <em>should</em> start agonizing about whether to trust your own mental processes if you think you&rsquo;ve seen a $20 bill stay put for several hours on the floor of Grand Central Station. Especially if your explanation is that nobody else is eager for money.</p>
<p>Is there any other domain such that if we <em>think</em> we see an exploitable possibility, we should sooner doubt our own mental competence than trust the conclusion we reasoned our way to?</p>
<p>If I had to name the <em>single</em> epistemic feat at which modern human civilization is most adequate, the peak of all human power of estimation, I would unhesitatingly reply, &ldquo;Short-term relative pricing of liquid financial assets, like the price of S&amp;P 500 stocks relative to other S&amp;P 500 stocks over the next three months.&rdquo; This is something into which human civilization puts an <em>actual effort</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Millions of dollars are offered to smart, conscientious people with physics PhDs to induce them to enter the field.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>These people are then offered huge additional payouts conditional on actual performance&mdash;especially outperformance relative to a baseline.<sup><a href=""#footnote-3-definition"" name=""footnote-3-return"">3</a></sup></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Large corporations form to specialize in narrow aspects of price-tuning.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>They have enormous computing clusters, vast historical datasets, and competent machine learning professionals.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>They receive repeated news of success or failure in a fast feedback loop.<sup><a href=""#footnote-4-definition"" name=""footnote-4-return"">4</a></sup></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The knowledge aggregation mechanism&mdash;namely, prices that equilibrate supply and demand for the financial asset&mdash;has proven to work beautifully, and acts to sum up the wisdom of all those highly motivated actors.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>An actor that spots a 1% systematic error in the aggregate estimate is rewarded with a billion dollars&mdash;in a process that also corrects the estimate.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Barriers to entry are not zero (<em>you</em> can&rsquo;t get the loans to make a billion-dollar corrective trade), but there are thousands of diverse intelligent actors who are all individually allowed to spot errors, correct them, and be rewarded, with no central veto.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is certainly not perfect, but it is <em>literally as good as it gets on modern-day Earth.</em></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I can beat the estimates produced by that process. I have no significant help to contribute to it. With study and effort I might become a decent hedge fundie and make a standard return. Theoretically, a liquid market should be just exploitable enough to pay competent professionals the same hourly rate as their next-best opportunity. I could potentially become one of those professionals, and earn standard hedge-fundie returns, but that&rsquo;s not the same as significantly improving on the market&rsquo;s efficiency. I&rsquo;m not sure I expect a huge humanly accessible opportunity of that kind to <em>exist</em>, not in the thickly traded centers of the market. Somebody <em>really would</em> have taken it already! Our civilization <em>cares</em> about whether Microsoft stock will be priced at $37.70 or $37.75 tomorrow afternoon.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t predict a 5% move in Microsoft stock in the next two months, and <em>neither can you</em>. If your uncle tells an anecdote about how he tripled his investment in NetBet.com last year and he attributes this to his skill rather than luck, we know <em>immediately and out of hand</em> that he is wrong. Warren Buffett at the peak of his form couldn&rsquo;t reliably triple his money every year. If there is a strategy so simple that your uncle can understand it, which has apparently made him money&mdash;then we guess that there were just hidden risks built into the strategy, and that in another year or with less favorable events he would have lost half as much as he gained. Any other possibility would be the equivalent of a $20 bill staying on the floor of Grand Central Station for ten years while a horde of physics PhDs searched for it using naked eyes, microscopes, and machine learning.</p>
<p>In the thickly traded parts of the stock market, where the collective power of human civilization is truly at its strongest, I doff my hat, I put aside my pride and kneel in true humility to accept the market&rsquo;s beliefs as though they were my own, knowing that any impulse I feel to second-guess and every independent thought I have to argue otherwise is nothing but my own folly. If my perceptions suggest an exploitable opportunity, then my perceptions are far more likely mistaken than the markets. That is what it feels like to look upon a civilization doing something adequately.</p>
<p>The converse side of the efficient-markets perspective would have said this about the Bank of Japan:</p>
<hr/>
<p><span style=""font-variant: small-caps;"">conventional cynical economist:</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Eliezer, you think you know better than the Bank of Japan and many other central banks around the world, do you?</p>
<p><span style=""font-variant: small-caps;"">eliezer:</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Yep. Or rather, by reading econblogs, I believe myself to have identified which econbloggers know better, like Scott Sumner.</p>
<p><span style=""font-variant: small-caps;"">c.c.e.:</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though literally trillions of dollars of real value are at stake?</p>
<p><span style=""font-variant: small-caps;"">eliezer:</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Yep.</p>
<p><span style=""font-variant: small-caps;"">c.c.e.:</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;How do you make money off this special knowledge of yours?</p>
<p><span style=""font-variant: small-caps;"">eliezer:</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;I can&rsquo;t. The market also collectively knows that the Bank of Japan is pursuing a bad monetary policy and has priced Japanese equities accordingly. So even though I know the Bank of Japan&rsquo;s policy will make Japanese equities perform badly, that fact is already priced in; I can&rsquo;t expect to make money by short-selling Japanese equities.</p>
<p><span style=""font-variant: small-caps;"">c.c.e.:</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;I see. So exactly who is it, on this theory of yours, that is being stupid and passing up a predictable payout?</p>
<p><span style=""font-variant: small-caps;"">eliezer:</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody, of course! Only the Bank of Japan is allowed to control the trend line of the Japanese money supply, and the Bank of Japan&rsquo;s governors are not paid any bonuses when the Japanese economy does better. They don&rsquo;t get a million dollars in personal bonuses if the Japanese economy grows by a trillion dollars.</p>
<p><span style=""font-variant: small-caps;"">c.c.e.:</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;So you can&rsquo;t make any money off knowing better individually, and nobody who has the actual power and authority to fix the problem would gain a personal financial benefit from fixing it? Then we&rsquo;re done! No anomalies here; this sounds like a perfectly normal state of affairs.</p>
<hr/>
<p>We don&rsquo;t usually expect to find $20 bills lying on the street, because even though people sometimes drop $20 bills, someone else will usually have a chance to pick up that $20 bill before we do.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t think we can predict 5% price changes in S&amp;P 500 company stock prices over the next month, because we&rsquo;re competing against dozens of hedge fund managers with enormous supercomputers and physics PhDs, any one of whom could make millions or billions on the pricing error&mdash;and in doing so, correct that error.</p>
<p>We can expect it to be hard to come up with a truly good startup idea, and for even the best ideas to involve sweat and risk, because lots of other people are trying to think up good startup ideas. Though in this case we do have the advantage that we can pick our own battles, seek out <em>one</em> good idea that we think hasn&rsquo;t been done yet.</p>
<p>But the Bank of Japan is just one committee, and it&rsquo;s not possible for anyone else to step up and make a billion dollars in the course of correcting their error. Even if you think you know exactly what the Bank of Japan is doing wrong, you can&rsquo;t make a profit on that. At least some hedge-fund managers also know what the Bank of Japan is doing wrong, and the expected consequences are already priced into the market. Nor does this price movement fix the Bank of Japan&rsquo;s mistaken behavior. So to the extent the Bank of Japan has poor incentives or some other systematic dysfunction, their mistake can persist. As a consequence, when I read some econbloggers who I&rsquo;d seen being right about empirical predictions before saying that Japan was being grotesquely silly, and the economic logic seemed to me to check out, as best I could follow it, I wasn&rsquo;t particularly reluctant to believe them. <em>Standard economic theory, generalized beyond the markets to other facets of society, did not seem to me to predict that the Bank of Japan must act wisely for the good of Japan.</em> It would be no surprise if they were competent, but also not much of a surprise if they were incompetent. And knowing this didn&rsquo;t help me either&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t exploit the knowledge to make an excess profit myself&mdash;and this too wasn&rsquo;t a coincidence.</p>
<p>This kind of thinking can get quite a bit more complicated than the foregoing paragraphs might suggest. We have to ask why the government of Japan didn&rsquo;t put pressure on the Bank of Japan (answer: they did, but the Bank of Japan refused), and many other questions. You would need to consider a much larger model of the world, and bring in a lot more background theory, to be confident that you understood the overall situation with the Bank of Japan.</p>
<p>But even without that detailed analysis, in the epistemological background we have a completely different picture from the modest one. We have a picture of the world where it is perfectly plausible for an econblogger to write up a good analysis of what the Bank of Japan is doing wrong, and for a sophisticated reader to reasonably agree that the analysis seems decisive, without a deep agonizing episode of Dunning-Kruger-inspired self-doubt playing any important role in the analysis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id=""iii"">iii.</h2>
<p>When we critique a government, we don&rsquo;t usually get to see what would actually happen if the government took our advice. But in this one case, less than a month after my exchange with John, the Bank of Japan&mdash;under the new leadership of Haruhiko Kuroda, and under unprecedented pressure from recently elected Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who included monetary policy in his campaign platform&mdash;embarked on an attempt to print huge amounts of money, with a stated goal of doubling the Japanese money supply.<sup><a href=""#footnote-5-definition"" name=""footnote-5-return"">5</a></sup></p>
<p>Immediately after, Japan experienced real GDP growth of 2.3%, where the previous trend was for falling RGDP. Their economy was operating that far under capacity due to lack of money.<sup><a href=""#footnote-6-definition"" name=""footnote-6-return"">6</a></sup></p>
<p>Now, on the modest view, this was the unfairest test imaginable. Out of all the times that I&rsquo;ve ever suggested that a government&rsquo;s policy is suboptimal, the rare time a government tries my preferred alternative will select the most mainstream, highest-conventional-prestige policies I happen to advocate, and those are the very policy proposals that modesty is least likely to disapprove of.</p>
<p>Indeed, if John had looked further into the issue, he would have found (as I found while writing this) that Nobel laureates had also criticized Japan&rsquo;s monetary policy. He would have found that previous Japanese governments had also hinted to the Bank of Japan that they should print more money. The view from modesty looks at this state of affairs and says, &ldquo;Hold up! You aren&rsquo;t so specially blessed as your priors would have you believe; other academics already know what you know! Civilization isn&rsquo;t so inadequate after all! This is how reasonable dissent from established institutions and experts operates in the real world: via opposition by other mainstream experts and institutions, not via the heroic effort of a lone economics blogger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However helpful or unhelpful such remarks may be for guarding against inflated pride, however, they don&rsquo;t seem to refute (or even address) the central thesis of civilizational <em>inadequacy</em>, as I will define that term later. Roughly, the civilizational inadequacy thesis states that in situations where the central bank of a major developed democracy is carrying out a policy, and a number of highly regarded economists like Ben Bernanke have written papers about what that central bank is doing wrong, and there are widely accepted macroeconomic theories for understanding what that central bank is doing wrong, and the government of the country has tried to put pressure on the central bank to stop doing it wrong, and literally <em>trillions</em> of dollars in real wealth are at stake, then <em>the overall competence of human civilization</em> is such that we shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised to find the professional economists at the Bank of Japan doing it wrong.</p>
<p>We shouldn&rsquo;t even be surprised to find that a decision theorist without all that much background in economics can identify which econbloggers have correctly stated what the Bank of Japan is doing wrong, or which simple improvements to their current policies would improve the situation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id=""iv"">iv.</h2>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t make much difference to my life whether I understand monetary policy better than, say, the European Central Bank, which as of late 2015 was repeating the same textbook mistake as the Bank of Japan and causing trillions of euros of damage to the European economy. Insofar as I have other European friends in countries like Italy, it might be important to them to know that Europe&rsquo;s economy is probably not going to get any better soon; or the knowledge might be relevant to predicting AI progress timelines to know whether Japan ran out of low-hanging technological fruit or just had bad monetary policy. But that&rsquo;s a rather distant relevance, and for most of my readers I would expect this issue to be even less relevant to their lives.</p>
<p>But you run into the same implicit background questions of inadequacy analysis when, for example, you&rsquo;re making health care decisions. Cherry-picking another anecdote: My wife has a severe case of Seasonal Affective Disorder. As of 2014, she&rsquo;d tried sitting in front of a little lightbox for an hour per day, and it hadn&rsquo;t worked. SAD&rsquo;s effects were crippling enough for it to be worth our time to consider extreme options, like her spending time in South America during the winter months. And indeed, vacationing in Chile and receiving more exposure to actual sunlight <em>did</em> work, where lightboxes failed.</p>
<p>From my perspective, the obvious next thought was: &ldquo;Empirically, dinky little lightboxes don&rsquo;t work. Empirically, the Sun does work. Next step: <em>more light</em>. Fill our house with more lumens than lightboxes provide.&rdquo; In short order, I had strung up sixty-five 60W-equivalent LED bulbs in the living room, and another sixty-five in her bedroom.</p>
<p>Ah, but should I assume that my civilization is being <em>opportunistic</em> about seeking out ways to cure SAD, and that if putting up 130 LED light bulbs often worked when lightboxes failed, <em>doctors would already know about that</em>? Should the fact that putting up 130 light bulbs isn&rsquo;t a well-known next step after lightboxes convince me that my bright idea is probably not a good idea, because if it were, everyone would already be doing it? Should I conclude from my inability to find any published studies on the Internet testing this question that there is some fatal flaw in my plan that I&rsquo;m just not seeing?</p>
<p>We might call this argument &ldquo;Chesterton&rsquo;s Absence of a Fence.&rdquo; The thought being: I shouldn&rsquo;t build a fence here, because if it were a good idea to have a fence here, someone would already have built it. The underlying question here is: How strongly should I expect that this extremely common medical problem has been thoroughly considered by my civilization, and that there&rsquo;s nothing new, effective, and unconventional that I can personally improvise?</p>
<p>Eyeballing this question, my off-the-cuff answer&mdash;based mostly on the impressions related to me by every friend of mine who has ever dealt with medicine on a research level&mdash;is that I wouldn&rsquo;t <em>necessarily</em> expect any medical researcher ever to have done a formal experiment on the first thought that popped into my mind for treating this extremely common depressive syndrome. Nor would I strongly expect the intervention, if initial tests found it to be effective, to have received enough attention that I could Google it.</p>
<p>But this is just my personal take on the adequacy of 21st-century medical research. Should I be nervous that this line of thinking is just an excuse? Should I fret about the apparently high estimate of my own competence implied by my thinking that I could find an obvious-seeming way to remedy SAD when <em>trained doctors</em> aren&rsquo;t talking about it and I&rsquo;m not a medical researcher? Am I going too far outside my own area of expertise and starting to think that I&rsquo;m good at everything?</p>
<p>In practice, I didn&rsquo;t bother going through an agonizing fit of self-doubt along those lines. The systematic competence of human civilization with respect to treating mood disorders wasn&rsquo;t so apparent to me that I considered it a better use of resources to quietly drop the issue than to just lay down the ~$600 needed to test my suspicion. So I went ahead and ran the experiment. And as of early 2017, with two winters come and gone, Brienne seems to no longer have crippling SAD&mdash;though it took a <em>lot</em> of light bulbs, including light bulbs in her bedroom that had to be timed to go on at 7:30am before she woke up, to sustain the apparent cure.<sup><a href=""#footnote-7-definition"" name=""footnote-7-return"">7</a></sup></p>
<p>If you want to outperform&mdash;if you want to do anything not usually done&mdash;then you&rsquo;ll need to conceptually divide our civilization into areas of lower and greater competency. My view is that this is best done from a framework of incentives and the equilibria of those incentives&mdash;which is to say, from the standpoint of microeconomics. This is the main topic I&rsquo;ll cover here.</p>
<p>In the process, I will also make the case that modesty&mdash;the part of this process where you go into an agonizing fit of self-doubt&mdash;isn&rsquo;t actually helpful for figuring out when you might outperform some aspect of the equilibrium.</p>
<p>But one should initially present a positive agenda in discussions like these&mdash;saying first what you think is the correct epistemology, before inveighing against a position you think is wrong.</p>
<p>So without further ado, in the next chapter I shall present a very simple framework for inadequate equilibria.</p>

<p><em>(<a href=""https://medium.com/@gusbicalho/interactive-model-knob-turning-7f905834c947"" target=""_blank"">Cross-posted from my medium channel</a>)</em></p>
<p>When you are trying to understand something by yourself, a useful skill to check your grasp on the subject is to try out the moving parts of your model and see if you can simulate the resulting changes.</p>
<p>Suppose you want to learn how a rocket works. At the bare minimum, you should be able to calculate the speed of the rocket given the time past launch. But can you tell what happens if Earth gravity was stronger? Weaker? What if the atmosphere had no oxygen? What if we replaced the fuel with Diet Coke and Mentos?</p>
<p>To really understand something, it's not enough to be able to predict the future in a normal, expected, <em>ceteris paribus</em> scenario. You should also be able to predict what happens when several variables are changed is several ways, or, at least, point to which calculations need to be run to arrived at such a prediction.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Minds-Fantasies-Reflections-Self-Soul/dp/0465030912/"" target=""_blank"">Douglas Hofstadter and Daniel Dennett</a> call that ""turning the knobs"". Imagine your model as a box with several knobs, where each knob controls one aspect of the modeled system. You don't have to be able to turn all the possible knobs to all possible values and still get a sensible, testable and correct answer, but the more, the better.</p>
<p>Doug and Dan apply this approach to thought experiments and intuition pumps, as a way to explore possible answers to philosophical questions. In my experience, this skill is also effective when applied to real world problems, notably when trying to understand something that is being explained by someone else.</p>
<p>In this case, you can run this knob-turning check interactively with the other person, which makes it way more powerful. If someone says &ldquo;X+Y = Z&rdquo; and &ldquo;X+W = Z+A&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s not enough to mentally turn the knobs and calculate &ldquo;X+Y+W = Z+A+B&rdquo;. You should do that, then actually ask the explainer &ldquo;Hey, let me see if I get what you mean: for example, X+Y+W would be Z+A+B&rdquo;?</p>
<p>This interactive model knob-turning has been useful to me in many walks of life, but the most common and mundane application is helping out people at work. In that context, I identify six effects which make it helpful:</p>
<h2>1) Communication check: maybe you misunderstood and actually X+W = Z-A</h2>
<p>This is useful overall, but very important if someone uses metaphor. Some metaphors are clearly vague and people will know that and avoid them in technical explanations. But some metaphors seem really crisp for some people but hazy to others, or worse, very crisp to both people, but with different meanings! So take every metaphor as an invitation to interactive knob-turning.</p>
<p>To focus on communication check, try rephrasing their statements, using different words or, if necessary, very different metaphors. You can also apply a theory in different contexts, to see if the metaphors still apply.</p>
<p>For example, if a person talks about a computer system as if it were a person, I might try to explain the same thing in terms of a group of trained animals, or a board of directors, or dominoes falling.</p>
<h2>2) Self-check: correct your own reasoning (maybe you understood the correct premises, but made a logical mistake during knob turning)</h2>
<p>This is useful because humans are fallible, and two (competent) heads are less likely to miss a step in the reasoning dance than one.</p>
<p>Also, when someone comes up and asks something, you&rsquo;ll probably be doing a context-switch, and will be more likely to get confused along the way. The person asking usually has more local context than you in the specific problem they are trying to solve, even if you have more context on the surrounding matters, so they might be able to spot your error more quickly than yourself.</p>
<p>Focus on self-check means double checking any intuitive leaps or tricky reasoning you used. Parts of you model that do not have a clear step-by-step explanation have priority, and should be tested against another brain. Try to phrase the question in a way that makes your intuitive answer look <em>less</em> obvious.</p>
<p>For example: <em>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure if this could happen, and it looks like all these messages should arrive in order, but do you know how we can guarantee that?&rdquo;</em></p>
<h2>3) Other-check: help the other person to correct inferential errors they might have made</h2>
<p>The converse of self-checking. Sometimes fresh eyes with some global context can see reasoning errors that are hidden to people who are very focused on a task for too long.</p>
<p>To focus on other-check, ask about conclusions that follow from your model of the situation, but seem unintuitive to you, or required tricky reasoning. It&rsquo;s possible that your friend also found them unintuitive, and that might have lead them to a jump to the opposite direction.</p>
<p>For example, I could ask: <em>&ldquo;For this system to work correctly, it seems that the clocks have to be closely synchronized, right? If the clocks are off by much, we could have a difference around midnight.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Perhaps you successfully understand what was said, and the model you built in your head fits the communicated data. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean it is the same model that the other person has in mind! In that case, your knob-turning will get you a result that&rsquo;s inconsistent with what they expect.</p>
<h2>4) Alternative hypothesis generation: If they cannot refute your conclusions, you have shown them a possible model they had not yet considered, in which case it will also point in the direction of more research to be made</h2>
<p>This is doesn't happen that much when someone is looking for help to something. Usually the context they are trying to explain is the prior existing system which they will build upon, and if they&rsquo;ve done their homework (i.e. read the docs and/or code) they should have a very good understanding of that already. One exception here is with people who are very new to the job, which are learning while doing.</p>
<p>On the other hand, this is incredibly relevant when someone asks for help debugging. If they can&rsquo;t find the root cause of a bug, it must be because they are missing something. Either they have derived a mistaken conclusion from the data, or they&rsquo;ve made an inferential error from those conclusions. The first case is where proposing a new model helps (the second is solved by other-checking).</p>
<p>Maybe they read the logs, saw that a request was sent, and assumed it was received, but perhaps it wasn&rsquo;t. In that case, you can tell them to check for a log on the receiver system, or the absence of such a log.</p>
<p>To boost this effect, look for data that you strongly expect to exist and confirm your model, where the absence of such data might be caused by relative lack of global context, skill or experience by the other person.</p>
<p>For example: <em>&ldquo;Ok, so if the database went down, we should&rsquo;ve seen all requests failing in that time range; but if it was a network instability, we should have random requests failing and others succeeding. Which one was it?&rdquo;</em></p>
<h2>5) Filling gaps in context: If they show you data that contradicts your model, well, you get more data and improve your understanding</h2>
<p>This is very important when you have much less context than the other person. The larger the difference in context, the more likely that there&rsquo;s some important piece of information that you don&rsquo;t have, but that they take for granted.</p>
<p>The point here isn&rsquo;t that there something you don&rsquo;t know. There are lots and lots of things you don&rsquo;t know, and neither does your colleague. And if there&rsquo;s something they know that you don&rsquo;t, they&rsquo;ll probably fill you in when asking the question.</p>
<p>The point is that they will tell you something <em>only if they realize you don&rsquo;t know it yet</em>. But people will <a href=""/lw/kg/expecting_short_inferential_distances/"" target=""_blank"">expect short inferential distances</a>, underestimate the difference in context, and forget to tell you stuff because it&rsquo;s just obvious to them that you know.</p>
<p>Focus on filling gaps means you ask about the parts of your model which you are more uncertain about, to find out if they can help you build a clearer image. You can also extrapolate and make a wild guess, which you don&rsquo;t really expect to be right.</p>
<p>For example: <em>&ldquo;How does the network works on this datacenter? Do we have a single switch so that, if it fails, all connections go down? Or are those network interfaces all virtualized anyway?&rdquo;</em></p>
<h2>6) Finding new ideas: If everybody understands one another, and the models are correct, knob-turning will lead to new conclusions (if they hadn&rsquo;t turned those specific knobs on the problem yet)</h2>
<p>This is the whole point of having the conversation, to help someone figure something out they haven&rsquo;t already. But even if the specific new conclusion you arrive when knob-turning isn&rsquo;t directly relevant to the current question, it may end up shining light on some part of the other person&rsquo;s model that they couldn&rsquo;t see yet.</p>
<p>This effect is general and will happen gradually as both your and the other person's models improve and converge. The goal is to get all obstacles out of the way so you can just move forward and find new ideas and solutions.</p>
<p>The more global context and skill your colleague has, the lower the chance that they missed some crucial piece of data and have a mistaken model (or, if they do, you probably won't be able to figure that out without putting in serious effort). So when talking to more skilled or experienced people, you can focus more in replicating the model from their mind to yours (<strong>communication check</strong> and <strong>self-check</strong>).</p>
<p>Conversely, when talking to less skilled people, you should focus more on errors they might have made, or models they might not have considered, or data they may need to collect (<strong>other-check</strong> and <strong>alternative hypothesis generation</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Filling gaps</strong> depends more on differences of communication style and local context, so I don't have a person-based heuristic.</p>",Gust,gust,Gust,

The primary reason for this was performance, though we also had a few other problems with the editor. Please let me know in case anything breaks, but overall I expect things to be a lot more stable now.</li><ul><li>With the move to the new framework comes markdown support. So feel free to use markdown in any of the text fields from now, it should be automatically translated into its rich-text equivalent (you can insert block-level images via the Toolbar and inline-images via markdown)</li></ul><li>We significantly decreased our bundle size with this update, though I still have some more cleaning up to do. The editor was the biggest part of the rework that I was blocked on, so wrapping up the performance improvements should now be a lot faster</li><li>We also made some style improvements and navigation improvements to the sequences and collection navigation. Though we are still wrapping up some stuff in that domain, so expect more in the coming days. </li></ul><p><strong>Edit: </strong>I also made some changes to the font and typography, as you might have noticed. I actually like this font (Garamond Premiere Pro) less, but the other one had rendering issues on Windows machines, so here we are. I will adjust the page piece by piece to work better with the new font, and in general add a bunch more font and typography polish soon. </p><p>On that note, I also slightly restructured the frontpage to have a bit of a less chaotic structure and be easier to skim. This cost us some vertical space, but I think is worth the cost in structure and getting rid of that weird card-hover interaction. </p><p></p>",habryka4,habryka4,habryka,

It refers to the way in which a limited agent might direct a more powerful agent to do its bidding. The limit agent starts out in control because it gets to design the more powerful agent, but it is not easy to retain that power. In most applications the limited agent is a human and the powerful agent is an AI.</p><p>Example of problems in this subfield include corrigibility, value learning, and informed oversight.</p><p>Logical Updatelessness is one of the central open problems in decision theory. An updateless agent is one that does not update on its observations, but instead chooses what action it wants itself to output upon being input those observations. It can use this to get counterfactually mugged (which is a good thing). This is basically the only way we know how to make a reflectively stable agent.</p><p>The problem is that we do not know how to translate updatelessness into a logical setting. In the toy models in which we can define updatelessness, the agent is logically omniscient and just makes empirical observations. Thus, starts out just as powerful as it will ever be. In fact, we can view it as though the only agent is the agent existing at the beginning of time. That agent chooses a policy, a function from inputs to outputs, and all the future agents can just blindly follow that policy without thinking.</p><p>In the logical setting, the future agents are smarter than the past agents. They learn more logic in addition to making empirical observations. The agent at the beginning time does not have the power to contain a policy from all the logical observations to actions. This agent does not choose a simple policy to follow in the future, but instead chooses a complicated program to run in the future.</p><p>I claim that logical updatelessness is hard while empirical updatelessness is easy because an empirically updateless agent is deferring control to a simple policy that it understands, while a logically updateless agent has to defer control to a more powerful agent that it does not understand. Thus, logical updatelessness can be viewed as a robust delegation problem.</p><p>If we think about this just in terms of reflective stability, a reflectively stable agent has to never have a conflict between what its future self wants and what its past self wants. You can only achieve this by having a single agent at the center of control across all time. This center of control has to be simple enough that the agent can follow it in the early time steps, but the agent has to keep following it at the late time steps too. Thus, the agent in the late time steps has to be a powerful agent optimizing on behalf of this simple center of control.</p>",Scott Garrabrant,scott-garrabrant,Scott Garrabrant,

We&#x27;re having the usual disagreements and debates like “what is and isn’t allowed here” or “is it worse to be infantile or exclusive?”. I think underlying a lot of these arguments are mistaken notions about how ideas get made. There is also a lack of self awareness about how the open nature of LessWrong fundamentally caps how much trust can be expected among participants. These are systemic issues, they&#x27;re not something Oliver and Ben can easily fix. </p><p>Let&#x27;s start with the bit everyone knows. Changing your mind, <em>really</em> changing your mind is hard. <a href=""https://www.readthesequences.com/Book-II-How-To-Actually-Change-Your-Mind"">It&amp;#x27;s stupid hard</a>. A large part of <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/o5z/on_the_importance_of_less_wrong_or_another_single/"">why LW 2.0 might be useful</a> is that it has the promise of helping people think better. In addition to its native difficulty, people are usually in a state of active defense against others getting them to do it. Even on LessWrong people are generally more interested in reading things that come with the pleasant feeling of <a href=""http://theviewfromhell.blogspot.com/2012/09/trying-to-see-through-unified-theory-of.html"">insight</a> rather than homework. In one of his recent posts Eliot expressed nothing less than <a href=""http://bearlamp.com.au/dojo-bad-day-contingency-plan/"">outright contempt</a> for such people. The problem is that this behavior makes sense.  </p><p>See, not only is changing your mind hard, it&#x27;s dangerous. There are people who make their living off getting others to change their mind in dangerous ways, and a lot of <a href=""https://namespace.obormot.net/Main/ListOfTrustAndCuriosityExploits"">our reluctance to perform weird mental gymnastics</a> is totally reasonable in the face of that. <a href=""https://www.lesserwrong.com/posts/T3nb24aZf7d5S2Lnm/musings-on-double-crux-and-productive-disagreement/"">Strange formal systems of interaction</a>, <a href=""https://www.lesserwrong.com/posts/KbaJsfBtdpGv7EKbC/the-mtg-color-wheel"">weird fake frameworks that are supposed to work well anyway</a>, <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/o9h/further_discussion_of_cfars_focus_on_ai_safety/"">bizarre ideas about what the real threats facing humanity are</a>, look I&#x27;m not saying this stuff is <em>bad</em> but you have to be acutely aware of what you&#x27;re really asking from people. If you dress in rags and look vaguely threatening, people won&#x27;t want to follow you into the dark alley of the human psyche. </p><p>Combine these two things together, and it&#x27;s fairly obvious why CFAR finds that their methods translate well in person but are hard to teach over the internet. <a href=""https://www.lesserwrong.com/posts/T3nb24aZf7d5S2Lnm/musings-on-double-crux-and-productive-disagreement/"">They seem convinced that</a> the problem is in the explanation, the <em>operative</em> explanation. They&#x27;re giving advice <a href=""https://namespace.obormot.net/Main/FourScopesOfAdvice"">at the level of &amp;#x27;use this bolt&amp;#x27;</a>, which is entirely missing the point. What&#x27;s missing isn&#x27;t instructions but trust. This is a high effort, <em>weird thing</em> being pushed by secretive private sector psychologists. Double Crux right now probably doesn&#x27;t need another drop of ink spilled on explanation until you&#x27;ve got the mission and strategy levels of explanation covered. Not &#x27;how this&#x27; but &#x27;why this&#x27;. </p><p>A necessary consequence of this is that in person training camps, where instructors have the full use of their charisma and physicality to rely on for establishing trust, where people have <em>explicitly set aside time to focus on this thing</em>, have <strong><a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/17/magazine/the-happiness-code.html"">paid good money and are willing to tolerate cramped conditions for the thing</a></strong>, well you&#x27;re going to see better results than you will as a semianonymous internet stranger. Another necessary consequence is that you&#x27;re just not going to get the high trust buy in from people that you need for this on an open forum with loose incentives for it. The kind of work that needs to be done to develop the early stages of an idea looks completely different from the kind to develop an idea in its adolescence. Taking these principles seriously suggests the following. </p><h2>When Ideas Are In Their Infancy</h2><p>Before an idea has really been developed, it&#x27;s very vulnerable. The author(s) won&#x27;t have smooth answers to everyones probing questions, they won&#x27;t have perfect rigor, some stuff will be just flat wrong, the seed might be good but the execution is stupid. If you have to get it perfect on the first iteration, then you&#x27;re not going to try and have very many ideas. When people write a blog, you don&#x27;t see all the effort they put into developing ideas before putting hands to keyboard. To me <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/p23/dragon_army_theory_charter_30min_read/"">the poster child for this sort of thing is Dragon Army</a>. Dragon Army was an idea that Duncan explicitly wanted workshop style feedback on, but the first draft was so horrifying to some people that it just became a disaster.

Blog posts have a sense of permanency to them, they&#x27;re meant to record a moment of time without being revisited for a while. This is stifling to the creation of new ideas. When I first think of something, it&#x27;s not ready to be entered into the permanent record. I don&#x27;t want to have it scrutinized by a bunch of unruly people with limited time. I want friends and peers who will give my ideas the time they deserve even if they wouldn&#x27;t do it for someone they don&#x27;t know as well. Conor for example <a href=""https://www.lesserwrong.com/posts/ZdMnP77yEE3wWPoXZ/continuing-the-discussion-thread-from-the-mtg-post/"">complained about how people aren&amp;#x27;t giving him the trust he would expect</a> after writing so much content for the site, and that&#x27;s a necessary consequence of only having the mass mode of communication. Instead of pretending like everyone on LessWrong will ever be a trustworthy audience for most members, acknowledge reality and provide space for a small number of people to develop ideas and store data. </li><li><strong>A Space For People To Privately Discuss Sketched Ideas With People They Trust</strong> - There&#x27;s a big difference between starting from zero and starting from your outline or first draft. Once this is complete and you want feedback from a wider range of people, you&#x27;re still not ready to publish to a blog. Generally it makes sense to run it by a handful of trustworthy reviewers who will catch things you missed or bring up fundamental objections and concerns before you&#x27;re publicly committed to defending them. Right now I manually send copies of my stuff to people, but a mailing list could work well for this. The key thing is that usually it&#x27;s not that I have a particular <em>general audience</em> in mind at this stage so much as specific people who I want to read the thing and comment. The &#x27;personal blog&#x27; model does not accurately capture this, instead just providing a slightly more selective version of the mass audience for me to wrestle with. </li></ul><h2>When Ideas Are In Adolescence </h2><p>Once an idea hits the blog post format, it&#x27;s open to incremental improvement at best. Further, because the crowd is so large it will think of many things the author did not, and ruthlessly point them out. It&#x27;s not necessarily malicious, it&#x27;s just a natural consequence of scale and the desire/need to improve. Therefore authors should be prepared for criticism by the time it&#x27;s coming, and readers need to not have their time wasted. In the service of that: </p><ul><li><strong>Have A Noise Filter</strong> - This would presumably be some kind of team of people that will seriously, for-real look at mostly developed concepts and judge whether they might be interesting or not. Upvotes do this kind of roughly, but they appear to be mostly working for now. </li><li><strong>Test Promising Ideas</strong> - Early adopters need to be encouraged and supported in the ecosystem. Does Double Crux empirically work, what would it even <em>mean</em> for Double Crux to &#x27;empirically work&#x27;? I don&#x27;t know, and I don&#x27;t really think a discussion about it can work until someone does. What we need isn&#x27;t 100 comments, it&#x27;s 10 people who will get off their ass and try the thing out in some kind of standard fashion for a month and tell us what they think. </li><li><strong>Only Present The Reluctant With The Best</strong> - Once you&#x27;ve tested ideas, make a repository of the stuff people who really put effort in agree has value. Do <em>not</em> resent people who are reluctant to go on wild epistemic goose chases. For one thing, many people simply don&#x27;t have the time. And if your community optimizes against people who don&#x27;t have a ton of free time, you&#x27;ll lose out on the membership of extraordinarily high value people that happen to have other things to be doing with their day. Influencing <em>their</em> behavior is a huge lever to move the world. For another, the people who don&#x27;t want to try Double Crux are being essentially reasonable.  </li><li><strong>Continue To Evaluate And Test Ideas Throughout Their Life</strong> - LessWrong lionizes empiricism and science, but then never seems to produce any. If you&#x27;re all serious about &#x27;improving the art&#x27; then you have to work on it, <em>really</em> work on it. The Sequences are nearly a decade old now, and as a &#x27;rationality textbook&#x27; they&#x27;re beginning to seriously show their age. A lot of the core studies cited are victims of the replication crisis, tons of good work has been done in the mean time that isn&#x27;t included such as Tetlock&#x27;s bibliography, there are very few inline citations to help enthusiastic readers learn more about the source material drawn from. We can do a lot better, but it&#x27;s not going to happen on its own. </li></ul><p>(This post was originally published at <a href=""https://namespace.obormot.net/Main/GuidedMentalChangeRequiresHighTrust"">https://namespace.obormot.net/Main/GuidedMentalChangeRequiresHighTrust</a>, thanks to friends who gave feedback.)</p>",ingres,ingres,namespace,

I could come up with guesses—too many negative initial weights that ReLUs prevent me from training out of, for example—but these don’t really give me useful predictions or interventions so I don’t want to pretend like I understand it.</p><p>What concerns me about this is that it may result in a bad choice of hyperparameters for my model going forward.</p><p>I’d really like to get reasonably answers out of my model as I zoom in to more specific values but if my model is going to behave in completely wacky ways when I start a new loop to do the exact same thing, it really brings down my level of trust.</p><p>In theory I could run several trials, and set random seeds, and check my weight initializations by digging into the keras documentation, but while some of those things might help none of them address the more philosophical problem of why I should expect sometimes that I’ll initialize my model and it will just consistently fail to learn anything for a dozen sets of parameters in a row, and then when I reset the model ONCE (which I thought I was already doing between every choice of parameters) it starts working for every set of parameters—those same sets of parameters that weren’t working before.</p><p>Anyway WTF.</p><p>Having thought about other things for five minutes, I’m realizing one of the most mysterious things to me in my code base is, somewhat ironically, the generator function I wrote to pull mini-batches of data from the dataset on hard disk. The function opens the file and runs through it and loops around, and it could be that (despite my shuffling the data) there’s a section with a bunch of really difficult examples and when it gets to that section and that’s what stops the algorithm from learning. Then it will just work its way out of this section on its own, and I don’t have the diagnostic tools available to figure out what to do about it.</p><p>That’s sort of depressing but I think it offers its own somewhat silly and obvious lesson:</p><p>Don’t assume someone else’s code is giving you problems.</p><p>So I worked things out enough to have a model that was definitely learning, and I left it running overnight so that it could train a reasonable amount and I’d come in in the morning, 100 epochs later (or less if early stopping kicked in) with a model that got 95%+ accuracy and I could work from there.</p><p>Unfortunately my computer’s sleep mode stopped it about three quarters of the way through the first epoch. It did get up to almost 86% train accuracy, so I’m not complaining too much (and it does take almost half an hour per epoch so it wasn’t a total waste of time.</p><p>But I’m left with two problems that I wish I’d seen resolutions to in the first courses I took on deep learning:</p><ol><li><p>How can I run a large amount of training so that if I need to interrupt that training my progress will be saved?</p></li><li><p>What sort of setup should I do with my OS so that it doesn’t fall asleep in the middle of training a model?</p></li></ol><p>I wouldn’t be surprised if both of these had a simple answer (I bet Keras has the ability to stop gracefully after a minibatch, for example, and I bet python has a module that allows me to set a process priority so that the computer thinks what I’m doing is important and doesn’t fall asleep, which I know it can do because it does that when I watch videos). But neither of them really occurred to me in those first courses and so they went unanswered.</p><p>So I guess I’ll add a second trite little takeaway:</p><p>When teaching a subject, defining the scope and the environment early on is just as important as the subject itself.</p></div></div></div></div>",magfrump,magfrump,magfrump,

If I give myself Slack to believe in whatever, won&#x27;t I just end up with a lot of wrong beliefs?

(In other words, no human has a truth-seeking process that will reliably get all the right answers.) </li></ol><p>[ I want to note that I fully believe I could be wrong about all four claims here, or thinking about this in the entirely wrong way. So <a href=""https://www.lesserwrong.com/posts/exa5kmvopeRyfJgCy/double-crux-a-strategy-for-resolving-disagreement"">fight me</a>. ]</p><p>Now, I&#x27;m going to specifically discuss Slack in one&#x27;s <em>meta</em> process. </p><p>So, while I can apply the concept of Slack to individual beliefs themselves (aka &quot;holding beliefs lightly&quot;), I am applying the concept more to the question of &quot;How do I come to know/understand anything or or call a thing true?&quot; </p><p>So, I&#x27;m not discussing examples of &quot;I believe X, with more or less Slack.&quot; I&#x27;m discussing the difference between, &quot;Doing a bunch of studies is the only way to know things&quot; (less Slack) vs. &quot;Doing a bunch of studies is how I currently come to know things, but I&#x27;m open to other ways&quot; (more Slack). </p><p>The less Slack there is in your process for forming beliefs, the more constraints you have to abide before being able to claim you&#x27;ve come to understand something. </p><p>Examples of such constraints include:</p><ul><li>I only buy it if it has had at least one peer-reviewed RCT. </li><li>This framework seems like it&#x27;ll lead to confirmation bias, so I will ignore it.</li><li>If it involves politics or tribalism or status, it can&#x27;t have any truth to it.</li><li>If it&#x27;s self-contradictory / paradoxical, it has to be one way or the other.</li><li>I can&#x27;t imagine this being true or useful because my gut reaction to it is negative. </li><li>I don&#x27;t feel anything about it, so it must be meaningless. </li><li>This doesn&#x27;t conform to my narrative or worldview.

(And further, I believe this to be one of the most important problems in rationality.) </p><p>That said, I see a lot of people&#x27;s orientations as: </p><p>&quot;My belief-forming process says this thing isn&#x27;t true, and in fact this entire class of thing is likely false and not worth digging into. You seem to be actively engaging with [class of thing] and claiming there is truth in it. That seems highly dubious—there is something wrong with your belief-forming process.&quot; </p><p>This is a reasonable stance to take. </p><p>After all, lots of things aren&#x27;t worth digging into. And lots of people have bad truth-seeking processes. Theirs may very well be worse than yours; you don&#x27;t have to consider something just because it&#x27;s in front of you. </p><p>But if you notice yourself unwilling to engage with [entire class of thing]... to me this indicates something is suboptimal. </p><p>Over time, it seems good to aim for being able to engage with more classes of things, rather than fewer. </p><p>If something is politically charged, yes, your beliefs are at risk, and you may be better off avoiding the topic altogether. But—wouldn&#x27;t it be nice, if one day, you could wade through the mire of politics and come out the other side, clean? Epistemics in tact? Even better, you come out the other side having realized new truths about the world? </p><p>I guess if I&#x27;m going to be totally honest, the reason I am saying this is because I feel annoyed when people dismiss entire [classes of thing] for reasons like, &quot;That part of the territory is really swampy and dangerous! Going in there is bad, and you&#x27;re probably compromised.&quot; </p><p>At least <em>some</em> of the time, the thing that is going on is the person just figured out how to navigate swamps. </p><p>But instead, I feel like the person lacks Slack in their belief-forming process and is also trying to enforce this lack of Slack onto others. </p><p>From the inside, I imagine this feels like, &quot;No one can navigate swamps, and anyone who says they are is probably <em>terribly</em> mistaken or naive about how truth-seeking works, so I should inform them of the danger.&quot;</p><p>From the inside, Slack will feel incorrect or potentially dangerous. Without constraints, the person may feel like they&#x27;ll go off the rails—maybe they&#x27;ll even end up believing in *gasp* horoscopes or *gasp* the existence of a Judeo-Christian God. </p><p>My greatest fear is not having false beliefs. My greatest fear is getting trapped into a particular definition of truth-seeking, such that I permanently end up with many false beliefs or large gaps in my map.</p><p>The two things I do to avoid this are:</p><p>a) Learn more skills for navigating tricky territories. For example, one of the skills is noticing a belief that&#x27;s in my mind because it would be beneficial for me to believe it, i.e. it makes me feel good in a certain way or I expect good things to happen as a result—say, it&#x27;d make a person like me more if I believed it. This likely requires a fair amount of introspective capacity. </p><p>b) Be open to the idea that other people have truth-seeking methods that I don&#x27;t. That they&#x27;re seeing entire swaths of reality I can&#x27;t see. Be curious about that, and try to learn more. Develop taste around this. Maintain some Slack, so I don&#x27;t become myopic. </p>",Unreal,unreal,Unreal,

It was easy enough to find a tutorial that set up MNIST and then find something that quickly hit 98%+ accuracy on it.</p><p>It was also much easier than I had worried it would be to set up a network that takes the same inputs through multiple parallel layers—in particular I wanted to try training a network with a dense layer that operates separately from the convolutional layer, then merges the results for the final output. This didn’t actually improve my performance at all but it was a nice exercise to learn how to do that, and I think from here I should be able to build networks with basically arbitrary graph structure so that’s exciting.</p><p>But since it’s a bit hard to pick at the last teeny bits of error in MNIST (I hit 98.6% accuracy on the test set on my first model) I wanted to pick up a bigger, badder dataset to play with. Since I wanted something that wasn’t MNIST my first thought was obviously notMNIST! So I went ahead and downloaded the dataset, unzipped it, ran a script to rewrite it as a matlab matrix, cleared my memory, reloaded only the numpy arrays, and tried to split them into train and test sets before getting into anything.</p><p>And then my computer ran out of memory.</p><p>This virtual environment has 8GB of ram, and this dataset consists of about 500k images at 28x28 resolution. Stored in a text file, the text file is 3.3 GB. Ironically, this is over ten times as big in file size as the scipy data. Maybe because it’s saving every pixel value as a float instead of an int? (Note: forcing the dataset to be ints did not help)</p><p>It’s not clear to me why I’m running out of memory now, when I haven’t even loaded my neural network into memory, but it is clear to me why I’d run out of memory when I got there.</p><p>What I actually want to do here is to push the train and test sets into different files, and just pull one minibatch at a time into memory during training, then drop that from memory and pull a new one. Googling reveals this to be a <a href=""https://github.com/fchollet/keras/issues/107"">common problem</a>, but it seems that the solutions are somewhat ad hoc.</p><p>In particular, the standard solution is to use a batch generator… which you write yourself.</p><p>This seems odd to me, since there are a few somewhat standard ways to store numerical data—I would expect that there would be a standard batch generator for accessing at least one such format, and the job of sticking my data in that format is much less annoying to me than the job of writing my own batch generator.</p><p>That said, it looks like this may just be a question of time. For example, Keras does have <a href=""https://keras.io/models/model/#fit_generator"">this function</a> which collapses the coding problem from building a loop in which to use the generator to only writing the generator. I wouldn’t be surprised to see an extension of this come up soon in which keras (or some other supplemental library) can pull from a standard format like scipy or numpy saved dictionaries and build its own generator with default parameters.</p><p>--</p><p>On an unrelated note, one thing I’ve considered idly from my armchair is the question of how much precision is actually useful in deep learning.</p><p>In a number of ways, reducing precision can be advantageous. For example, ReLUs work for training because they are an approximation of a simple combination of sigmoid units, but they are popular because by dropping precision in that approximation they become MUCH faster to compute. Similarly, data augmentation by adding noise, especially in image processing, is a well established and effective way of improving performance. In a sense, this is trying to force your model to learn not to care too much about specific, precise details. </p><p>It seems to me that another way of pushing these kinds of advantages would be to use a less precise data type for the weights of your network to begin with. If each step of your gradient descent process has some threshold for what size of step is meaningful, versus what size of step is so small as to be not worth updating on because it is likely to be noise, then I can imagine getting some advantages similar to L1 normalization, data augmentation, and simpler architecture by spending less time on the computations in backpropagation and less memory per parameter.</p><p>That said, I can think of a few reasons this might not be practical, even if I don’t know which of those reasons will or will not apply in practice.</p><ul><li><p>It could be that linear algebra libraries have already been optimized to work on 64-bit floats, and optimizing on smaller data types like 32 or 16 bit floats wouldn’t actually speed up calculations (this is my number one guess for why this isn’t done)</p></li><li><p>It could be that removing small gradient descent updates damages momentum and makes networks more likely to get caught in long stretches of close-to-flat loss differences, since it can’t take as many small steps that might lead it in the right direction.</p></li><li><p>It could be that the behavior of networks depends, through some chaotic process, a lot on very small changes in results coming through the middle layers of the network. I would be surprised about this, since it’s clear that small differences on the earliest layers (for example the input) shouldn’t create big differences, and neither should small differences on the latest layers.</p></li></ul></div></div></div></div>",magfrump,magfrump,magfrump,

Next, Re, the ‘enjoyment’ reward, where enjoyment is pleasure endorsed as ‘genuine’ by common judgement. Assume that Rp(H)=1, Rp(F)=1/3, Re(F)=1/2, and Re(H)=0 - heroin is more pleasurable than a feast but less enjoyable.</p><p>Finally, there is the <em>twisted </em>reward Rt, which is Rp conditional on I and Re conditional on ¬I (twisted rewards may seem more complicated than simple rewards, but that is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_riddle_of_induction#Responses"">not always the case</a>).</p><p>There are two natural p&#x27;s: pr, the fully rational planner. And pf, the planner that is fully rational conditional on I, but always maps to H if I is chosen: pf(R)(I)=H, for any reward R.</p><h3>Compatibility</h3><p>The pair (pr, Re) is not compatible with π: it predicts that the human would take action F following I (feast following injection). The reward Rp is compatible with neither m: it predicts H following ¬I (heroin following no injection).</p><p>The other three pairs are compatible: pr(Rt), pf(Rt), and pf(Re) all give the correct policy π.</p><h3>Regret and overriding rewards</h3><p>This leads to a definition of when the AI is overriding human rewards. Given a pair compatible (p,R), an AI’s action A overrides the human reward if π|A is poorly optimised for maximising R. If V(π)(R|A) is the expected reward (according to R, conditional on A) of the actual human policy, and V*(R|A) is the expected reward of the human following the ideal policy for maximising R, then a measure of how much the AI is overriding rewards is the regret:</p><ul><li><p>V*(R|A)-V(π)(R|A).</p></li></ul><p>One might object that this isn’t the AI overriding the reward, but reducing human rationality. But these two facets are related: π|A is poorly fitted for maximising R, but there’s certainly another reward R&#x27; which π|A is better suited to maximise. So the AI is effectively forcing the human into maximising a different reward.</p><p>(An alternate, but related, measure of whether people’s reward is being overridden is whether, conditional on A, p(R) is ‘sensitive’ to the reward R. A merely incompetent human would have p(R) changing a lot dependent on R - though never maximising it very well - while one with reward overridden would have the same behaviour whatever R it was supposedly supposed to maximise).</p><p>Apply these to the example above. The (pr, Rt) pair means that the human is rationally maximising the twisted reward Rt. The (pf, Rt) is one where the injection forces the human into a very specific behaviour - specific behaviour that coincidentally is exactly the right thing for their reward. Finally, (pf, Re) claims that the injection forces the human into specific behaviour that is detrimental to their reward. In the first two cases, the AI’s recommended action is I (expected reward 1 versus 1/2 for ¬I, maximum regret 1/2), in the second it’s ¬I (expected reward 1/2 versus 0 for I, maximum regret also 1/2).</p><p>Of course, it’s also possible to model humans are opiode-maximisers, whose rationality is overridden by not getting heroin injections; as already stated, rewards and rationality cannot be deduced from observations alone.</p><h3>As above, so below: no natural default</h3><p>You may have noticed that, according to this definition, an AI is over-riding human rewards when it lets humans just be less effective at achieving their goals. An irrationality on the part of a human is a thus a failure of an AI that serves the human interest.</p><p>But this is not a new problem in AI. You start with a goal phrased as &quot;reduce suffering&quot;, and expecting it to cure pain and diseases, before realising you&#x27;re instructed it to optimise the universe to force everyone to avoid the slightest bit of contrary emotion.</p><p>Similarly, there is no clear way to distinguish &quot;don&#x27;t force humans into behaviour contrary to their rewards&quot; from &quot;make sure humans maximise their rewards to the upmost&quot;. We better make damn sure we get the right reward.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>",Stuart_Armstrong,stuart_armstrong,Stuart_Armstrong,

    <p>A lot of ink has been spilled about how to get various decision algorithms to
cooperate with each other. However, most approaches require the algorithm to provide some
kind of information about itself to a potential cooperator.</p>

<p>Consider <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05060"">FDT</a>, the hot new kid on the block. 
In order for FDT to cooperate
with you, it needs to reason about how your actions are related to the algorithm
that the FDT agent is running. The naive way of providing this information is
simple: give the other agent a copy of your “source code”. Assuming that said
code is analyzable without running into halting problem issues, this should
allow FDT to work out whether it wants to cooperate with you.</p>

<h2 id=""security-needs-of-decision-algorithms"">Security needs of decision algorithms</h2>

<p>However, just handing out your source code to anyone isn’t a great idea. This is
because agents often want to pretend to have a different decision algorithm to
the one that they really do.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h3 id=""threats-and-capitulation-thresholds"">Threats and capitulation thresholds</h3>

<p>Many people adopt some version of the “don’t give in to threats” heuristic. The
reasoning here is solid: while refusing to give in to a threat carries a penalty
in the particular instance, being the kind of person who doesn’t give in to threats pays
off in the long run because you receive fewer threats.</p>

<p>However, usually this will come with an escape hatch in case the stakes get too
high. If I am trying to extort £100 from you by plausibly threatening to destroy
the planet, <em>you should just pay the money</em>. Why is this okay? Well, threats of
higher magnitude are usually harder to create, or carry higher costs for the
threatener, so an agent can expect to face relatively few of them.</p>

<p>The absolute <em>best</em> thing for an agent, though, would be to have the reputation
of <em>never</em> giving in to threats, no matter how high the cost, while <em>actually</em>
being willing to give in to threats above some threshold. That way you never get
threatened, but if by some ill luck you do face an enormous threat, you
can still capitulate. In general, an agent would like their capitulation
threshold to be perceived to be as high as possible, ideally infinity.</p>

<p>It is therefore in an agent’s interest to hide their capitulation threshold. If
an adversary finds out what it is, and it’s something they can exceed easily,
then they can exploit you, even if they only get one shot at threatening you.</p>

<p>This makes an agent’s capitulation threshold a piece of sensitive data, and
keeping it secret is a <em>security</em> problem. Obviously just handing our your
source code is right out, but an agent should also take other security
precautions. To give a short list:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Be cautious about talking about how you make decisions.</li>
  <li>Try to conceal any evidence of occasions when you have capitulated in the past.</li>
  <li>Avoid revealing information about your past behaviour in general, or at least
follow <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomar_response"">glomarization</a> rules.</li>
  <li>Avoid interacting with agents who appear to be probing for sensitive
information (e.g. escalating threats).<sup id=""fnref:fail2ban""><a href=""#fn:fail2ban"" class=""footnote"">1</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<h3 id=""all-data-is-sensitive"">All data is sensitive</h3>

<p>I’ve been talking about a capitulation threshold because it’s an easy example,
but the history of computer security tells us that leaking <em>any</em>
kind of information about your implementation can be dangerous. It’s best to
just assume that attackers have magical attack powers and hide as much as you can.</p>

<p>(Aside: what about FDT? Isn’t it immune to this kind of exploitation? Sure, but
you’re not going to be running FDT, you’re going to be running some approximation to it. 
Imagine an agent running FDT-approx, which spends N cycles computing an approximation to FDT,
then acts on that. The value of N is then sensitive data - knowing that could
allow an adversary to construct a situation just complicated enough to lead to
poor behaviour without being too costly to construct.)</p>

<p>But if we are operating in a context where revealing information about how we work
is dangerous, how are we supposed to reveal enough about ourselves to be able to
cooperate effectively?</p>

<h2 id=""zero-knowledge-cooperation"">Zero knowledge cooperation</h2>

<p>We can borrow some ideas from security to help us here. Suppose that A wishes to
convince B that they are likely to cooperate in an upcoming game. What A <em>actually</em> wants
to convey to B is that precise fact: they are likely to cooperate. Ideally they
would reveal no other knowledge at all. What we want is a <em>zero-knowledge proof</em> 
of A’s willingness to cooperate.</p>

<p>This seems like it could be a whole subfield of work, but here are a few suggestions.</p>

<h3 id=""private-histories"">Private histories</h3>

<p>One way for A provide evidence that they are likely to cooperate is to provide
historical evidence that they cooperated in similar situations in the past.
However, this is sensitive information, so ideally they would like it
not to be public.</p>

<p>So let’s suppose that after a game has played out, the results are made public,
but identifying each agent with a unique token, for which they can provide a
<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof#Discrete_log_of_a_given_value"">zero-knowledge proof of ownership</a>.</p>

<p>Thus A can reveal that they were a participant in a previous game,
providing evidence towards their future actions, but without providing this
knowledge to anyone except B.</p>

<h3 id=""secret-source-code-sharing"">Secret source-code sharing</h3>

<p>The most convincing evidence A could provide would be a copy of its source
code.<sup id=""fnref:running""><a href=""#fn:running"" class=""footnote"">2</a></sup> However, they don’t want B to <em>end up</em> with that, but only the derived
information that it “looks trustworthy”.</p>

<p>To that end we can run the following protocol.<sup id=""fnref:protocol""><a href=""#fn:protocol"" class=""footnote"">3</a></sup></p>

<p>First, A provides B with a copy of A’s source code, encrypted using A’s secret
key and a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption#Fully_homomorphic_encryption"">fully
homomorphic</a> 
encryption scheme.<sup id=""fnref:expensive""><a href=""#fn:expensive"" class=""footnote"">4</a></sup> Then B runs (homomorphically) a
program (the Validator) on the source code that validates a property (in this case
“trustworthiness”), and outputs 0 or 1 depending on whether the property holds.
Crucially, the Validator also <em>signs</em> this output with B’s secret key.</p>

<p>Now what B actually receives is an encrypted version of the Validator’s
output, so B has to return this to A for decryption. A can validate that the decrypted
response matches an agreed upon pattern (is 0 or 1, not, say, the full source code), in
which case they pass it back to B, along with the signature. Since A cannot
forge B’s signature, B trusts that this really is the output of the
Validator.</p>

<p>I <em>think</em> this is a zero-knowledge proof, since B cannot replicate the process
for someone else without having A’s secret key, and a log of the transactions
does not rule out B having provided A with the response beforehand. Informally,
the “surprising” part of the protocol is A producing a token with B’s signature,
but this is only surprising to B, and could be easily faked for a third part if
A and B were colluding.</p>

<h2 id=""conclusion"">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I think the situation looks surprisingly good here. A cautious agent should be
able to get by with revealing the minimum amount of information about itself.
The biggest problem is the currently prohibitive cost of FHE, but I’m optimistic
that that will come down over time.</p>

This is most likely what contemporaries thought the play was about, including Aeschylus himself.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">It is also a play about sexual politics, and the relationship between the idea of the rule of law as actually implemented in the West, and patriarchy.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">This is a good example of the well-known phenomenon in which literary criticism and other forms of textual analysis frequently get something “out of” the text that the author had no apparent intent of putting into it - and that many coherent narratives can be extracted from the same text. Far more than an author could plausibly have meant to put into the text. This is often taken as evidence that such readings are spurious.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Robin Hanson <a href=""http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/02/control_variabl.html""><span class=""s2"">argued</span></a> that one way to extract information from published studies that was comparatively uncontaminated by publication bias, was to look at the coefficients of <i>control</i> variables. The idea is that if your study is about, say, the effect of alcohol on life expectancy, journals may be unwilling to publish it if you get an improbable-seeming result, or no significant result. But less scrutiny is applied to the estimated effect of alcohol if you’re studying something <i>else</i>, and simply “control for” alcohol (i.e. include it in your model as a possible predictor).</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Likewise, great literature is typically an integrated, multi-dimensional depiction. While there is a great deal of compression, the author is still trying to report how things might really have happened, to satisfy their own sense of artistic taste for plausibility or verisimilitude. Thus, we should expect that great literature is often an honest, highly informative account of everything <i>except</i> what the author meant to put into it.</span><span id=""more-2869""></span></p>
<h1 class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">Two readings of the Oresteia</span></h1>
<h2 class=""p4""><span class=""s1"">The cycle of revenge and the rule of law</span></h2>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">In the classic reading of the Oresteia, the central theme is the cycle of revenge.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">The proximate origin of the cycle is that Paris, a Trojan prince, violates hospitality norms by absconding from Sparta with the wife of king Menelaus. The king’s brother Agamemnon, who is king in Argos, leads an alliance of Achaian cities to wage war on Troy, to recover his brother’s wife. En route to Troy, the Achaian fleet is becalmed by an angry goddess who sympathizes with Troy, and Agamemnon is told by his priest that he must sacrifice his own daughter to save the fleet. He does so.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">There is also a mythological origin of the cycle, in which multiple ancestors of Agamemnon feed someone their own or someone else’s son, which brings a curse onto their family, which leads to more conflict, which leads to more such revenge-motivated atrocities, which lead to more curses.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Agamemnon’s wife Clytemnestra - a woman, and therefore associated with the spirit of primal, subterranean, feminine, emotional vengeance, rather than open orderly masculine discipline - is unhappy that her husband murdered their daughter. So she teams up with her lover to murder Agamemnon when he returns home from the war. Apollo, god of open orderly masculine discipline, then instructs her son Orestes to kill his mother in response, because she killed his father. Orestes does this, but thereby incurs the wrath of the Furies, primal subterranean feminine emotional vengeance spirits.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Orestes seeks sanctuary in Apollo’s temple, and Apollo directs him towards a neutral party - the goddess Athena - to seek adjudication of the competing claims. Athena, the patron goddess of Athens, comes up with a characteristically clever solution. After getting both sides to agree to her arbitration, she empanels a jury of twelve Athenian citizens, to judge the case. Clytemnestra and Orestes each had no recourse except vigilante violence, because they were operating at the level of kings, who have no earthly authority above them to prevent them from doing injustice. But if <i>everyone</i> is subject to the law as a formalism, then in principle <i>everyone</i> has recourse when injured, no matter who the offender was.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">The jury decides for Orestes. The Furies at first warn that letting a kinslayer go free will lead to unrestrained violence, but Athena points out that the jury trial system will for the most part serve as an adequate deterrent. Athena then compensates the Furies by establishing permanent rites in their honor.</span></p>
<h2 class=""p4""><span class=""s1"">Sex, reproduction, and patriarchy</span></h2>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">The sex of the various “sides” of the cycle is not mere chance. Helen of Troy may not have been unwillingly abducted. If not, then treating Paris’s behavior in the court of Menelaus as a violation of hospitality builds in the assumption that women are subsidiary to their men. Agamemnon was not compelled to go to war to recover a stray wife, and when he chose to continue against the will of a goddess, he sacrificed his dispensable daughter instead of his son and heir.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">On the home front, his wife Clytemnestra was dealt poor hand, but played it very well. Constantly dismissed and written off as a flighty, emotional woman, it would have been quite difficult for her to hold political power on her own. So she took a lover, Aegisthus, who was a plausible rival claimant to the Argive throne. Exiling her son Orestes served two purposes: it removed a potential threat to her lover and puppet king, and also provided her with a potential backup plan in the form of a blood relative with a claim on the throne, if things didn’t work out with Aegisthus.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">When Agamemnon returned home together with his war-prize Cassandra, Clytemnestra managed the politics of the scene cleverly, persuading Agamemnon to walk from his chariot to his palace on an expensive oriental tapestry, in the fashion of the great kings of the East he’d just been at war with, driving home to onlookers that he’d just spent the lives of many of their relatives to greatly enrich himself. At the end of the first play, she restrains Aegisthus from getting into a shouting match with an angry crowd, pointing out that they have no actual power.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Orestes returns at the command of Apollo to kill his mother, but is only able to do so with the help of other <i>women</i> of the court, including his wet-nurse.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">When Orestes seeks sanctuary in the temple of Apollo, Apollo comes up with a clever plan. His argument in court will hinge on the claim that Orestes is not kin to his mother - and moreover that fathers, but not mothers, are blood relatives of their children. Since the Furies are specifically pursuers of kinslayers, this argument destroys their case. It’s also ridiculous.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">So Apollo decides to go venue shopping. In particular, he has Orestes seek judgment from the one goddess who uniquely has a father but no mother: Athena. Thus, at a key moment in the proceedings, he is able to point to the <i>presiding judge herself</i> as evidence for his wackadoodle claim.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">The gambit works and Orestes is freed, with Athena herself casting the deciding vote. Athena promises the Furies honorary rites by the elder men and women of the city as compensation, but in the end, we see only the women of the city honoring them, not the men whose patriarchal authority has been consolidated by this victory.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">This generalizes. It’s part of a broader pattern, in which the dominance of one group over another is rationalized by lies about where production comes from. The claim that women are not blood-kin to their own children but instead analogous to the fertile earth that seeds sprout in is structurally similar to the contemporary devaluation of traditionally feminine labor, such as many caretaking tasks that women are often asked to do by default, for free, under the assumption that this is not <i>work in need of recognition and reward</i> but instead just <i>the way women are</i>.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">This has serious implications for the project of financializing and legibilizing human interaction. Even honest metrics of value-creation are vulnerable to Goodhart’s Law. All the more so should we be careful, since there is ample reason to believe that the standard metrics for assessing contributions have been designed to favor entrenched interests. If we’re going to have <i>real</i> rule of law, we’re going to need to reconceptualize the relationship between sex, production, and reproduction, otherwise we’ll just stay locked into a framework that systematically deprecates a class of entirely legitimate claim.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Likewise, Agamemnon, Clytemnestra, and Orestes all end up in double binds, but Clytemnestra’s behavior is framed as gratuitous vindictiveness, while Agamemnon and Orestes are both depicted by the characters in the chorus as dutiful men making their best of a bad lot.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">I owe the seed of this interpretation to Kate Millet’s <i>Sexual Politics</i>, though I’ve added some detail.</span></p>
<h1 class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">Sensitive reading</span></h1>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">In an <a href=""http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2016/08/chuck_klosterma.html""><span class=""s2"">interview</span></a> with Russ Roberts, Chuck Klosterman - author of <i>But What If We’re Wrong?</i> - points out that the art that stands the test of time is often art that later generations can read new meanings into, that stands up to multiple readings. He suggests that anything too famous now, like the writings of celebrated authors such as David Foster Wallace, is at a disadvantage simply because it’s already been contextualized, with discussion that’s likely to stymie future attempts at reinterpretation.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Of course, some readings really are made up, erroneous, or otherwise ungrounded in the text. But that doesn’t mean that these new readings are an entirely arbitrary creative exercise. Writing is many-dimensional; great writers really do put a lot into their text. Tone, pacing, characterization, occasional telling details - and of course the things being described generally have many attributes. Writers seeking verisimilitude of any sort will of course compress the details quite a bit, but when compressing, they have recourse not to their conscious intent - the problem is incomputable - but to their sense of taste when deciding which details to add, which angles to depict, which scenes to skip entirely.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">An honest, sensitive reporter will often include telling details that permit interpretations they did not intend. My <a href=""http://benjaminrosshoffman.com/steve-jobs-impossibility-parents/""><span class=""s2"">reading</span></a> of Walter Isaacson’s biography of Steve Jobs is an example. Isaacson seems to have meant to imply that Jobs felt abandoned by his birth parents, and that his troubled relationships with other potential mentor figures were caused by this inner trauma. But Isaacson conscientiously included enough detail - details which seemed interesting and telling even if he couldn’t articulate exactly what they meant - to enable my alternate reading - that Jobs felt abandoned by his <i>adoptive</i> parents, insofar as he was clearly smarter than them.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">When reading authors from very different times and places, often the most interesting thing to us may have simply been <a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/08/13/figureground-illusions/""><span class=""s2"">background</span></a> to them. Aeschylus’s <i>Oresteia</i> may have been intended as a work about the rule of law and its relation to democracy. But after reading Kate Millet’s <i>Sexual Politics</i>, I cannot help but see it as a work about the relationship between the <i>idea</i> of the rule of law as <i>actually implemented in the West</i>, and patriarchy. For Aeschylus, perhaps the sex dynamics in his story were a mere background - but for verisimilitude, his poet’s eye included them. And he was a sensitive and honest enough reporter of the way things are, that we can get things out of his stories that he didn’t mean to put into them, and talk about the sexual politics of his work as foreground.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Of course, this <i>does</i> take talent. Pulp novels are less informative, not because they are meant to appeal to “low” tastes - so did Shakespeare! - but because they appeal to cliches instead of trying to see each thing anew, rather than coining new expressions - like Shakespeare - not to show off, but because the old grooves did not satisfy the poet’s eye as a <i>precise</i> description of what they saw.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Curiously, I end up at the same conclusion as Klosterman about authors such as David Foster Wallace - but for a different reason. Wallace’s writing seems to be <i>consciously</i> multi-dimensional, optimized along every dimension I can think of for contemporary interests. In <i>Infinite Jest</i>, his largest work, he expertly weaves together themes of communication, writing in multiple dialects, themes of addiction, writing in an addictive style, and an alternate world that has itself been shaped to match these themes. So many things are intelligibly interesting to the sensitive <i>contemporary </i>reader that I suspect he has optimized away as noise the things that would be interesting to future readers.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">So, it is not the <i>fact</i> that such a work has been analyzed in its own generation, that will make it uninteresting to future readers. It is the sacrifice of serendipitous interestingness that was necessary to make it so analyzable so soon.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">It is a learnable skill to see poets - or, as we call them now, writers of fiction - as intelligence sources, as a valuable source of uncorrupted reporting about what’s really going on - and not just as entertainment (and poor entertainment at that, since it’s for people with a different outlook than our own).</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">I’ve had some training in this skill, in college. If you think that my writing’s been helpful in framing things, a fair amount of that comes from this sort of “close reading.” I think that with a little practice and iteration I can teach this skill, and it might be worth taking the time to try; I suspect it’s also helpful for generating <i>new</i> insights, especially ones that are out-of-model for the dominant paradigm. It might be helpful for the sort of discourse that is needed to <a href=""http://benjaminrosshoffman.com/seeding-productive-culture/""><span class=""s2"">seed a productive culture</span></a> - not least because it could open up participants to outlooks genuinely outside the post-1950 Western consensus.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">This is the sort of thing that would require some amount of patience - I can’t just <i>tell</i> you what to get out of the text, that’s much lower-resolution than the sort of perceptiveness and curiosity that can come out of guided discussion. And of course, I’ve learned this sort of thing, but have had limited experience teaching it. But it’s patience on the order of weeks, not months or years, before we should be able to evaluate results.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">If a group of between six and twenty people were interested in making an extended time investment, I’d likely be happy to organize an experimental retreat of appropriate length - or series of regular in-person meetings - to have facilitated discussions of a series of texts that appear to be in conversation with each other. Doing this work one-on-one seems less highly leveraged, but I might could be persuaded.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Here are a few <a href=""http://benjaminrosshoffman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Reading-sequences.pdf"">reading lists</a> of texts - mostly written - that I think - if read together - would be good sequences for this sort of exercise, as they seem to be in conversation of a sort with one another. These are provisional and subject to lots of revision. I’m also happy to try to put together a sequence on other topics.</span></p>

This was supposed to be the place where all our efforts over the past 8 months came together, and we made The Best Summer Camp Ever. </p><p>ESPR is a two week summer program for highly talented students 16-19 across the world. We had talks/classes on machine learning, cognitive psychology, effective altruism, cryptocurrencies, and salsa dancing. (Note that everything except for the dancing may not be representative.)</p><p>I was a participant of ESPR 2016; last year, it was called EuroSPARC. The camp name and spirit is modeled off the US-based <a href=""https://sparc-camp.org/"">SPARC camp</a>. For ESPR 2017, I ended up being responsible for (part of) admissions, communications, assorted pre-camp logistics, and camp counselor duties. </p><p>This post is structured as a sort of free-form analysis, where I examine a section of ESPR, look at how it worked in practice, and then move on to another section. There are some common threads between these sections, but there&#x27;s not really a central thesis; there&#x27;s just a series of lessons that I learned.</p><p>Also, like most post-mortems, any analysis is undoubtedly going to focus on the Bad and the Sub-optimal. To provide some early counterbalance to the ensuing dive into things which ended up not working, here’s a quick overview of what went <em>well:</em></p><ul><li><p>72% of our participants rated us 9/10 or 10/10 when asked how glad they were that they attended.<br/></p></li><li><p>Unexpected setbacks which could have critically ended ESPR were miraculously solved by heroic staff in the nick of time.<br/></p></li><li><p>Multiple students took initiative during camp and taught their own classes, grabbed us a guest speaker, and other exciting things. (See the section on <strong>Improving Camp Experience</strong> for more details.)</p></li></ul><p>Thus, ESPR had many encouraging signs that things went well. </p><p>Of course, a string of things also went wrong. Volunteers left, interpersonal conflicts were raised, and it’s not clear that our participants got much in the way of concrete takeaways.</p><p>I hope that looking at all these different pieces of the project can shed some light on why some of the bad things happened, and how we can do better for similar projects in the future.</p><h2><strong>tldr;</strong></h2><p>Here’s an overview of the points that are covered below in the following paragraphs:</p><ol><li><p>This year’s diverse curriculum arguably decreased the value of takeaways for the participants.<br/><br/></p></li><li><p>A vague mission statement meant that different ESPR staff had sometimes conflicting goals which weren&#x27;t well resolved.<br/><br/></p></li><li><p>Evaluating what participants got out of ESPR is a very hard task because there are lots of relevant factors. <br/><br/></p></li><li><p>One strong way to improve the ESPR experience for participants is to bring in more opportunities for independent projects and ownership of learning.<br/><br/></p></li><li><p>Unclear role and responsibility specification led to negative incentives for people to take initiative on tasks.</p></li></ol><h2>Initial <strong>Expectations and Values:</strong></h2><p>I’m going to be evaluating different parts of ESPR, so it seems crucial to give an outline for which things I cared about and found relevant. </p><p>First and foremost, I had originally wanted ESPR to be able to churn out people who’d be motivated to work on problems in the rationality space and effective altruism space. </p><p>(This has now actually changed; see the <strong>Evaluating Participant Takeaways</strong> section for more details.)</p><p> A big part of this was that, as an ESPR 2016 alumnus, I had found the camp to be important in roping me in deeper to these ideas, which I consider valuable.</p><p>The actual effects of my slant on camp was tempered by others, who had different views, giving pushback. (More on this idea in the <strong>Diversity and Dilution</strong> section.)</p><p>But I just want to set the framing that, compared to other staff on the ESPR team, I was probably one of the ones who leaned the most in the direction of rationality / EA.</p><h2><strong>Diversity and Dilution:</strong></h2><p>As I mentioned above, there was some strong pushback by others to make ESPR less directly about <em>just</em> rationality and effective altruism. The end result meant that the camp ended up being quite different than just “CFAR, but for super smart high school students”.</p><p>And I don’t think this was bad. In the end, I agreed with much of the concerns raised with the pushback, and I’ve also updated my thoughts on what exactly ESPR should be trying to give students. (More on this in the next section <strong>Evaluating Participant Takeaways</strong>.) </p><p>Still, something that I don’t think I fully appreciated at the time was that diversity has costs because the camp’s focus is a zero-sum resource. Any time you introduce a wider range of topics to cover, it’s conceptually less clear for the students what the “important things” are. </p><p>(I’m mainly talking about curriculum here; it’s not clear that it generalizes to other activities, given that “classes” and “not-class-things” already have a clear conceptual boundary.)</p><p>A phrase that was often repeated at camp was, “I have no idea how I’m going to explain ESPR to my friends and family when I get back home. There’s been so much that happened.”</p><p>This sentiment, to me, seems to maybe be a bad sign. There are definite reasons to want a camp to be set up like an experience that travels across many domains in a way that makes it hard to easily articulate, but this also makes it harder to track what happened. </p><p>For me, I think it boils down to the question of whether or not the takeaways are stronger when people need to put in effort to explicate them (as would be the case if the initial feel was “hard to explain”) or when they are more clearly chunked (as would be the case if clearer demarcations and perhaps less subjects were covered).</p><p>I think one of the stronger benefits for having a more diverse curriculum is that students are able to pick and choose the takeaways they want. If you cover lots of things, then it’s more likely you’ll hit upon something that resonates with them.</p><p>Yet, while this does seem like a good thing that could have happened, we also didn’t stress that this sort “take what you need” was the appropriate attitude during camp. Overall, I think the end result was that a lack of a good structure for students to organize what they learned.</p><p>Another related barrier for takeaways was ESPR’s focus on bringing together students from a mix of countries; ESPR 2017 had participants from a greater range of countries than ESPR 2016. This led to more difficulties in communication than last year, and I think we didn’t account for this heavily enough in the initial planning.</p><p>Cultural expectations within the classroom (EX: how the “teacher” and student dynamic played out) and other social norms felt like they contributed to the wide spread of attitudes and ideas, at least initially. </p><p>Of course, one thing I also heard a lot of people say at ESPR was, “One of the best things here is meeting people from lots of different cultures and seeing how things are in other places.”</p><p>The obvious answer to the above is “Find the sweet spot between having a mix of cultures and cultural commonalities.” We couldn’t just optimize directly, though, as lots of staff had lots of opinions which differed.</p><p>In an effort to bring in people from lots of places, we launched ESPR with a fairly vague mission statement. This meant that we had people under our banner who held conflicting implicit goals, despite the fact that, outwardly, we all supported the overt, non-controversial mission statement.</p><p>For example, I very much wanted our participants to get more into effective altruism and rationality. Other people wanted ESPR to be a more playful experience, where students could explore a variety new ideas (and not be shoved face-first into certain ones).</p><p>One problem this led to was happening discussions about what sorts of values we should have <em>during</em> camp, rather than <em>before</em>. I think that, had we been more explicit about our goals upfront, we could have worked around some of these problems.</p><p>Specifically, we could have brokered compromises early on to ensure that people knew what they were getting in return, and we knew what everyone actually wanted (and that a discussion was happening on how they could get it). </p><p>Failing to account for this when bringing on a diverse group of people meant that we had to regress to the broad mission statement (once again diluting things), and were less able to satisfy many of the staff’s specific preferences, or come to acceptable agreements for both sides.</p><h2><strong>Evaluating Participant Takeaways:</strong></h2><p>The whole reason we put in effort to make ESPR 2017 happen was because of the participants. Though everyone on the staff might have had diverging agendas, we all wanted <em>something</em> to happen to the participants as a result.</p><p>Evaluating ESPR’s impact, however, is a difficult process. Group dynamics are complicated to model, there are lots of confounding factors, and getting clear indication of participant growth (let alone counterfactual growth!) is hard.</p><p>With all that in mind, I’ll try to dive a little into what my thoughts are on exactly what the effects were.</p><p>First off, I think it seems reasonable that the three largest factors in influencing the experience of camp for the participants were:</p><ol><li><p>The curriculum (EX: What topics were covered.)<br/></p></li><li><p>Additional activities which encourage ownership (EX: Getting students to do their own independent projects.)<br/></p></li><li><p>The admissions process (EX: Who we took in.)</p></li></ol><p>From a combination of survey data and first-hand impressions, I think that about 67% (~20) of the participants came away with <em>some</em> kind of takeaway. In terms of EA/rationality orienting, though, it seems that about 17% of the students (~6) got a lot out of ESPR.</p><p>It’s not clear, though, that these are the base rates of “what percentage of people who go to ESPR come out awesome?” There are several confounding factors here. </p><p>One of the biggest ones is that most of the people who seemed to pan out very well (i.e. were good along the EA/rationalist axes) were also people who we knew were already exposed to these ideas prior to camp. This also seemed to be true for last year, and I count myself as one of them.</p><p>So, back to the overall goal of ESPR, there’s a crucial question of “rope newcomers into the community” versus “marshall existing young community members” which I think we partially sidestepped early on. </p><p>Part of this had to do with ESPR’s focus on high achieving participants, for example those who had succeeded in national and international math competitions. Here’s one version of the story for why we focusing on these students from a consequentialist position might make sense:</p><p><em>“Most of the important discoveries are going to be done by people who are at the top of their field. Thus, making sure that the future is going to turn out well means making sure the smartest people in 20 years have a good set of ethics. Thus, we should focus on those people.”</em></p><p>And while I don’t think any explicit form of the above reasoning took root in our decision process, I definitely think it was present in some form.</p><p>Now, though, I think that trading off additional technical ability for pre-exposure to EA/rationalist is generally a good idea if the thing you care about is impact, and the actual benefits work out in its favor. In other words, we should weight attitude more than we currently do in the attitude-aptitude trade-off.</p><p>This is a direct result of my experience at ESPR 2016 / 2017. </p><p>(Note that this may still be too small of a sample for my opinion here to mean very much.)</p><p>I’ve also changed my mind on what I want participants to get out of ESPR:</p><p>As a result of conversations with others who gave pushback on explicitly pushing for the rationality and effective altruist angle, I think I’ve now pivoted to thinking that the point of ESPR is to get more people thinking altruistically, with effectiveness and rationality as merely nice-to-haves.</p><p>What I sort of mean by that is a set of questions that sort of goes like, “Do I expect this person to be doing exciting work that will, on net, be beneficial to other people in the future? Do I expect them to care about helping others? Do I see them interacting with others who are engaging in humanitarian projects?”</p><p>(I know the above criterion is still vague, and it merely sort of maps onto my gut impressions / checking in with my internal anticipations to see what I expect. It also feels like the best I’ve got for now.)</p><p>Anyway, this is a noticeable shift from my original viewpoint of “Let’s get everyone super into effective altruism and rationality!”</p><p>While part of this is arguably due to holding more realistic expectations about base rates for memetic adoption (read: the onset of cynicism), there is another part of me that’s genuinely unsure about how stable or correct the EA / rationalist frameworks are. It just seems like a good idea to have people who share similar values exploring a different space, even if my values were deeply EA-aligned.</p><p>Knowing all this now will probably make some things clearer if / when I start to consider applicants for ESPR 2018. </p><p>But evaluation is still difficult. Above, the 67% and 17% estimates were only for benefit the <em>participant</em> received. Yet, there’s other ways a participant could be a good pick, even if they themselves didn’t get that much out of ESPR.</p><p>Consider the following factors, which would all seem to indicate that, from a consequentialist viewpoint, it was “good” for ESPR to take on a certain student:</p><ol><li><p>Degree to which the student contributed positively to the camp environment (EX: Alice was responsible for making camp better for other students.)<br/>Relative difficulty to measure: 1/4<br/></p></li><li><p>Degree to which the student received concrete takeaways from the camp (EX: Bob came away with a new outlook on life.)<br/>Relative difficulty to measure: 2/4<br/></p></li><li><p>Degree to which a student’s received benefit was counterfactually good. (EX: Carol had a very positive learning experience at ESPR, relative to all her other options for the summer.)<br/>Relative difficulty to measure: 3/4<br/></p></li><li><p>Degree to which the student will go on to have a positive impact on the world (EX: Evan leaves ESPR with grand ideas and creates a startup designed at providing free global WiFi.)<br/>Relative difficulty to measure: 4/4</p></li></ol><p>Looking at both the ESPR 2016 and 2017 cohorts, my impression is that, while some clustering in the above factors occurs, it’s also really hard to predict this type of stuff ahead of time, as well as measure this post-camp.</p><p>In fact, I’d find it plausible that trying to subtly control admissions for the above factors is largely useless. During admissions, we made certain bets on which students might fit the above factors, EX: which ones we expected to contribute a lot to the overall atmosphere.</p><p>Some of those bets panned out, but some of them didn’t. </p><p>As a result, while I think it’s true that admissions has a strong overall effect on the camp, we can’t escape base rates. It seems likely that, at the end of the day, we’d also have seen roughly the same 67% and 17% percentages.</p><p>A good part of my intuition for this comes from the fact that “probability that a student takes well to crazy-sounding ideas” (which is what at least 30% of what ESPR is, I claim) seems to be distributed about the same, largely independent of who we pick. </p><p>This overall seems to be a point <em>against</em> admissions being important. </p><p>The outside view says that the communication channels we used to advertise ESPR actually did a lot of the heavy lifting of filtering for capable candidate (which might in itself be a positive of focusing on highly talented students, contra my “attitude over aptitude” stance).</p><p>Still, my internal estimate says that, even if the 20th best candidate wouldn’t have differed greatly from the 50th best candidate, <em>surely some type of filtering by the interviewer (i.e. me) was happening was relevant to why they were even in the final pool, right? </em></p><p>And perhaps the right response here is, “Owen, you’re being fooled by noise!”</p><p>(“I can’t hear you over the sound of my self-righteousness!”)</p><p>Actually, though, I think the right answer is that interviewing is pretty good at avoiding Type 2 errors: Most of the people we rejected after interviewing were (I subjectively claim), probably not that great. </p><p>However, the fact that our bets didn&#x27;t all pay off seems to indicate that we&#x27;re going to get false positives, and this is something we can&#x27;t strongly remove.</p><h2><strong>Improving The Camp Experience:</strong></h2><p>While it’s debatable, then, what effect admissions selection has on the camp experience (which is why I listed it last), it seems clearer that what actually happened at camp had a large effect on the participants.</p><p>There is a story, albeit one that I don’t endorse, where the majority of the value of ESPR comes from simply bringing smart people together. As this model goes, the actual classes themselves aren’t as important as the social aspects dominate, and the social aspects are responsible for most of the good things ESPR offers.</p><p>So, within the context of class curriculum, camp events, and evaluating their impact, here are my two thoughts:</p><ol><li><p>Most of the benefit to participants from ESPR can be traced back to just a few (albeit, different) events.<br/></p></li><li><p>Providing opportunities for ownership of ideas / learning is one of the most important pedagogical techniques, and we underutilized it.</p></li></ol><p>The first point is basically a consequence of how humans compare things relatively. </p><p>Even if all the events we provided at ESPR are super-duper great, there’s going to be implicit ranking and comparison happening in the students’ heads. While I think this means we could strategically aim for certain events to be “The Important Ones”, I also think we can’t get too good estimates on which events will land well (with a few exceptions).</p><p>This ignorance doesn’t mean, though, that we’re allowed to slack off on quality for some activities. Rather, it feels like having every activity be Awesome is a <em>prerequisite</em> for those relatively life-changing opportunities to crop up in the first place.</p><p>The analogy here is how you have lots of thoughts everyday, but it’s likely only a few of them are insightful. But you can’t get them in the first place by trying to think just a few thoughts; if you aren’t always thinking, they just won’t come.</p><p>The second point is about giving students more opportunities to exert their own Do Thing muscles. Overall, I feel like we still emphasized learning over doing. </p><p>I think it’s clearly Good that ESPR made time for students to assert their own abilities and own up to crazy ideas. This manifested in letting students teach afternoon classes, sending them off into the world, and assigning one another Quests to accomplish.</p><p>I think two of the most successful activities in this spirit that we ran at ESPR were Lightning Talks and Social Engineering. During Lightning Talks, every student was encouraged to give a talk on a topic (any topic! English tea! Wales! Freud!) for about 2 minutes. Social Engineering was, in a nutshell, when we sent students off into the streets of London to convince companies to do nice things for us.</p><p>There seems to be something that’s just Good© about letting students do projects / schemes, and I think we didn’t mine this area nearly enough for all the good things that could have popped out. </p><p>And for what we did do, the results we got were always interesting and, surprisingly often, impressive. (Guest speakers! Deep dives into humor analysis! Free lunches!)</p><h2><strong>Camp Internals:</strong></h2><p>When it came to the actual interactions between the ESPR staff, I think the biggest problem we faced was the unclear designation of roles and a lack of specificity in what the roles were supposed to do.</p><p>Like most things in life, no one was being actively stupid in not spotting this beforehand. It just happened that there was a chain of understandable events which led to this being the state of affairs we found ourselves in. </p><p>But the end result was still such that, by the time ESPR started, there still wasn’t mutual understanding or agreement on which tasks each role (student, counselor, instructor, ops, etc.)  was responsible for. I think this ended up being harmful to some staff, me included, as well as overall camp operations.</p><p>First off, a lack of clear duties for each role meant that there was a lot of inter-role variation. Staff who were supposedly doing the same thing in name would end up having quite different tasks in actuality. This is similar to the issue with divergent goals all flocking under the general mission statement banner.</p><p>I think this ended up breeding bad sentiment (at least for me) when the benefits associated with each role, which <em>also</em> weren’t well-specified beforehand, ended up poorly calibrated, i.e. incommensurate, with the amount of effort different staff were putting in.</p><p>The obvious thing to do, then, is to once again try to be upfront with each volunteer about what they were hoping to give in and get out of the project. And I think we sort of did this. </p><p>The problem here was that these expectations changed over the course of the project, as some people did more than we initially brought them on for. People’s actual roles stretched and shortened throughout the extent of the project, and motivation often rose or dropped for individual staff. And as the situation changed, earlier promises couldn’t always be fulfilled, or people asked for more.</p><p>Related to this is the fact that different criteria are used to evaluate competence for each of the roles, and this competence doesn’t necessarily translate from domain to domain. </p><p>This meant that ESPR was placed in a dynamic where some people who went the extra mile weren’t always compensated the way they wanted to be because they would perform poorly at those roles. For example, an outstanding instructor might have wanted to also try her hand at operations work, but we ended up saying no to the request because she likely wouldn’t have been very useful in ops.</p><p>There was a definite trade-off, then, satisfying between people’s preferences and what would be “best” for the camp overall.</p><p>Once again, I think being more upfront about all this and spending more time to find compensatory measures would have been very useful in curbing some of these issues. </p><p>Even in strictly volunteer-only roles, I claim that people always have tacit expectations for what their give / get relationship with the project “should” look like, and our inattention in this area meant additional burdens were borne out unequally by certain ESPR staff.</p><p>Lastly, I think there is often a type of pressure for groups to put tasks up for grabs, in an Everyone Does Everything sort of way. There’s something that feels virtuous and democratic and “nice” about this setup, as it sends a signal that roles are irrelevant and everyone is equal / pitches in.</p><p>I want to push against this intuition.</p><p>Putting tasks up for grabs in a democratic way negatively incentivizes first-movers who take the initiative. It’s a tragedy of the commons, where everyone is individually better off if they wait for another person to shoulder yet another task. </p><p>But it’s not just this dynamic; I claim it’s worse than that.</p><p>Tasks you accumulate snowball, <em>further</em> punishing people who take the initiative. This dynamic pulls people into deeper roles which, if the responsibility / reward structure isn’t laid out well, breeds burnout and bad feelings.</p><p>Here’s an example that actually happened: </p><p>Right before ESPR started, we needed to figure out transportation for the students. As I had some spare time, I ended up doing the preliminary logistics work of cataloging all the info we had into a spreadsheet. But this also meant that for the next action we had to take on transportation, I was also the go-to person because I “had done it last time”.</p><p>The cycle here is pretty vicious—with each additional task that I did to further our transportation goals, it also became less likely that I’d get additional help from other people because the <em>required background knowledge increased</em>. </p><p>EX: “I could also rope in Alice to help with this task, but then I’d have to tell them about X, Y, and Z. Oh well; I guess it’s more efficient for the group if I just do it again then.”</p><p>The obvious answer here is perhaps to fight against the sunk-cost response that appears in the above example because roping in an additional person in the know will actually <em>save</em> time down the road. But, really, what I think we need is just a better way of letting people take ownership of certain tasks. Ambiguity in delegation is a recipe for inaction.</p><p>I think prior to ESPR, I might have also tried to champion an organizational structure along the lines of Everyone Does Everything. </p><p>I no longer endorse this, and, as a result of my experience, lean towards a much more top-down / legible and explicit approach when it comes to distributing tasks in an organization or project.</p><h2>Personal <strong>Conclusion:</strong></h2><p>So that&#x27;s a lot about how ESPR The Project functioned. </p><p>For Owen The ESPR Staff (i.e. me, personally), my experience was largely very positive and it was paired with, as I&#x27;ve perhaps alluded to, several disappointments. </p><p>I felt like we missed some of the cohesiveness and &quot;spirit&quot; that was present in ESPR 2016, but this was partially remedied by the inclusion of new bright spots, like seeing last year&#x27;s participants step up as counselors or this year&#x27;s participants teaching their own classes.</p><p>Overall, I took on <em>significantly</em> more responsibility than I originally signed up for, and diving deep into the thick of things was highly instructive. Most of the insights, though, seem to be in the form of gut-level expectations, and this post-mortem has been an attempt to tease out some of those models and intuitions.</p><p>For the rationality community at large, I&#x27;m unsure what the takeaways are. Student outreach is always tricky, and there&#x27;s much more to be said about things like setting camp culture and how different students interact with the entire rationality memeplex.</p><p>As a case study of how several people come together to form an organization and then execute on a major project, holding goals roughly aligned with the community at large, I think we can serve as a useful example. </p><p>There&#x27;s a definite change in the quality of a model when it comes to knowing something vs experiencing it, but it&#x27;s my hope that this can contribute to the ongoing discourse on group rationality as well as pedagogy.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>",,,,

What are they?</em></p><p>This is more a heuristic that I use. It’s not a scientific argument. First, the “spotlight” of attention is how cognitive scientists tend to talk about perceptual attention. The things that are task-salient in my environment. How I select and interact with those, basically. Second, the “starlight.” If the spotlight is about doing things, the starlight is who I want to be, not just what I want to do. It’s like those goals that are valuable for their own sake, not because they’re instrumental toward some other goal. Also, over time, how we keep moving toward those, and how we keep seeing the connections between the tasks we’re doing right now, and those higher-level or longer-term goals. Third, the “daylight.” In the philosopher Harry Frankfurt’s terms, it’s wanting what you want to want—the domain of metacognition. Basically, if the “spotlight” and the “starlight” are about pursuing some goal, some end, some value, the “daylight” is about the capacities that enable us to discern and define what those goals, those ends, are to begin with.</p></blockquote><p>The full essay this references is not yet available, but there are extracts <a href=""http://ninedotsprize.org/extracts-stand-light-freedom-persuasion-attention-economy/"">here</a> </p></div></div></div></div>",PDV,pdv,PDV,

</style></head><body><p>An idea I've been kicking around for a while without getting very far:</p>
<p>The <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1399"">big problem with epsilon-exploration</a> as a way of getting reasonable counterfactuals is that it only tells the agent what would happen if it took an action unpredictably, rather than predictably; as a result, it doesn't tend to do the best thing in problems where what you are predicted to do is quite important, such as Newcomb's problem and game-theoretic problems.</p>
<p>A very direct-seeming approach to this problem is to try and explore, but in a predictable manner. This allows you to find out what the environment does if you take some action reliably.</p>
<p>The obvious way to go about this is to do epsilon-exploration, but with a very predictable pseudorandom source rather than the usual. There are two problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If the logical inductor itself can easily predict the exploration, then it doesn't actually help get good counterfactuals: the agent can see what action will be taken, so conditional expectations of other actions aren't guaranteed to be well-defined or high-quality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even if this did create well-behaved counterfactuals, it doesn't seem like it does the right thing in game-theoretic situations. If the other players can see what action you'll take, then they may simply exploit you. You could do the right thing in Newcomblike situations, where you just have to realize that predictably doing a certain thing is good; but in Prisoner's Dilemma, predictably cooperating seems to just leave you open to defection, so you'd likely learn to defect.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Policy Exploration</h2>
<p>My proposed fix for #2 is to explore over some notion of policy, rather than directly over actions. In general, a policy is a function from observations to actions -- we might interpret this as a function from the deductive state to actions. That's pretty big and intractable for a logical inductor to consider, though. In simultaneous-move games, a reasonable notion of policy is a function from your prediction of the other player's actions to your action probability. For example, in Prisoner's Dilemma, NicerBot is the policy of cooperating with probability epsilon greater than your estimate of the other player's probability of cooperating. Copying the other player's probability of cooperation incentivises them to cooperate when playing with you. Adding epsilon makes you slightly more exploitable than you would otherwise be, but it encourages cooperative equilibria over noncooperative; for example, it ensures that you cooperate with other NicerBots rather than defect.</p>
<p>If we could predictably explore into policies, we would start out occasionally being NicerBot. Whenever exploration picks NicerBot, the other player would be able to see this; the other player should then cooperate, since that's the best thing you can do when playing with NicerBot. We then learn that things turn out pretty well for us if we're NicerBot. We then start being NicerBot on non-exploration rounds as well.</p>
<p>There are a couple of holes in that story. For one thing, LIEDT and LICDT will defect against NicerBot. So, it's not true that a wide variety of opponents would cooperate with NicerBot. Perhaps we're OK with that because we only expect to be able to cooperate with more game-theoretically savvy players. But, a <em>really</em> savvy player will <em>also</em> defect against NicerBot, and hold out for NicerBot++ who cooperates with <em>much</em> higher probability than the player. The savvy player recognizes that it can teach us which policies to use by defecting and cooperating selectively, rather than myopically doing what gets the most utility on a single round.</p>
<p>But, perhaps we have to set those problems aside and settle for incremental progress. It still seems like this approach would solve some things we don't currently know how to solve, <em>if</em> we could solve problem #1.</p>
<h2>Unupdated Exploration</h2>
<p>I can solve problem #1 in a somewhat unprincipled way which relates to the problem of logical updatelessness.</p>
<p>Suppose that we make decisions from the perspective of a logical inductor which has been run for less time. We could make our decisions at <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""n""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">n</span></span></span></span></span></span> from the perspective of an <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""n-1""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">n</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space2""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.298em; padding-bottom: 0.446em;"">−</span></span><span class=""mjx-mn MJXc-space2""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">1</span></span></span></span></span></span> or even a <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""log(n)""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">l</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">o</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.519em; padding-right: 0.003em;"">g</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">(</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">n</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">)</span></span></span></span></span></span> market. We still use epsilon-exploration, as usual, to make the counterfactuals well-behaved. However, from the perspective of other agents running for <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""n""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">n</span></span></span></span></span></span> time, the exploration generated by a <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""<n""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">&lt;</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">n</span></span></span></span></span></span> market will be predictable.</p>
<p>By itself, this isn't very interesting, because it just says to run the market for less time. Running the market for less time may help make the agent more predictable, but it also makes the agent less intelligent.</p>
<p>When we combine it with the suggestion of exploring on policies, though, it suggests a two-stage approach to decisions. First, we run the market for <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""log(n)""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">l</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">o</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.519em; padding-right: 0.003em;"">g</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">(</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">n</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">)</span></span></span></span></span></span> (or <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""n-1""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">n</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space2""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.298em; padding-bottom: 0.446em;"">−</span></span><span class=""mjx-mn MJXc-space2""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">1</span></span></span></span></span></span> or <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""n/2""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">n</span></span><span class=""mjx-texatom""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">/</span></span></span></span><span class=""mjx-mn""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">2</span></span></span></span></span></span> ect), and make a decision about policy. The policy determines the action based on market state at <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""n""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">n</span></span></span></span></span></span>. Then, we compute market <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""n""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">n</span></span></span></span></span></span>, and use the policy determined previously to choose the action.</p>
<p>This is essentially a hackish version of logical updatelessness. We run a logical inductor for a short time, and use it to decide how to respond to a logical inductor which has been run for much longer. We hope that the first inductor has been run for long enough that its policy choice is sensible.</p>
<p>It's not difficult to imagine generalizing this to a multi-stage approach, in which you decide how to decide how to [...] how to decide. This would, perhaps, help deal with the problem of savvy agents mentioned earlier. But, such a hierarchy would still have to deal with the question: what's the earliest stage which we are OK giving power? We have to defer some judgement to early stages without losing everything to the madness of the early stages. We want to make decisions at the earliest stage where they can be <em>sensibly</em> made.</p>
<p>It's not clear what ""sensible"" should mean.</p>
<h2>Policy Representation</h2>
<p>I mentioned earlier that the market state can't properly reason about the full space of functions from market states to actions. This is even more true of earlier market states trying to use later ones, and even <em>more</em> true if we have any kind of iterated hierarchy of meta-policy decisions.</p>
<p>It seems, however, like there can be a lot to gain just from choosing a small number of key beliefs to make policies about. So, there should be some sensibly small policy representation which is still useful.</p>
<p>Again, it's not clear what ""sensible"" should mean.</p>
<p>(I think Jessica had some thoughts on this a while ago, but I don't remember what they were.)</p>

<p>Maybe I can get a jump on our approach to medical care for the new kiddo.</p>
<p>One thing that sticks out at me is that children in the US get a lot of vaccinations. &nbsp;At my quick count it's something like 37 shots by the time they're 5.</p>
<p>I grew up in the US in the 80s and I don't remember getting nearly this many. &nbsp;Is my memory faulty? &nbsp;I'm pretty sure it was more like 12 back in those days. &nbsp;Is this all really necessary? Nobody likes getting shots, especially not children. &nbsp;What changed, anyway?</p>
<p>Now, I'm not an expert on immunology or epidemiology so I expect diving into the literature isn't going to be fruitful; I won't be able to ante up decades of education and experience fast enough. &nbsp;Presumably this is what we pay people at the US CDC and Department of Health for.</p>
<p>But can you *really* trust them? &nbsp;Aren't all of these vaccinations really convenient for the&nbsp;pharmaceutical industry? &nbsp;Aren't there seemingly constant allegations/lawsuits about the over-prescription of drug interventions in the US?</p>
<p>The health care systems in major world countries have access to all of the same literature, and they're presumably staffed by educated, expert people too so they should all come to the same conclusions as the US system right? &nbsp;Not so!</p>
<p>Here's how many shots each nation's health care system recommends by the time children turn 5.</p>
<p>37 US</p>
<p>25 UK</p>
<p>25 Germany</p>
<p>16 Sweden</p>
<p>16 Denmark</p>
<p>The intersection of vaccines being recommended are TDAP, MMR, Polio, HIB and PCB.</p>
<p>In the US we also recommend: Hep A, Hep B, Rotavirus, Meningococcus, Varicella, and yearly flu shots (for babies and children).</p>
<p>Can we explain the variance? &nbsp;I can think of a few reasons they would vary.</p>
<p>1. Cultural bias. &nbsp;This can be big. &nbsp;A psychiatrist in the UK told me that they're not as pharma heavy as, say, psychiatrists in Germany because of a WW2 era bias: lots of the big pharma companies are German.</p>
<p>2. Cultural and environmental differences. &nbsp;Some diseases are a bigger deal in some countries than others. &nbsp;Japan (not included above) recommends immunization against diseases (TB, Japanese encephalitis) that none of the systems above are too concerned with.</p>
<p>3. Undue industry influence. &nbsp;Run-of-the-mill corruption.</p>
<p>4. Quality of health care systems and social safety nets vary.</p>
<p>When it comes to cultural and environment differences I have a hard time imagining that the orthodoxy varies because Hep A is a much bigger deal in the US.&nbsp; I presume the calculus changes based on your geographic neighbors, but is it a meaningful difference?&nbsp; Or is it a counterproductive cultural bias?&nbsp; For example, in the US we may spend more time thinking about diseases people in central America suffer from than the people in Denmark might, but do the neighbors in this case meaningfully translate to a higher disease risk?&nbsp; Or are we vaccinating against unfounded fears?</p>
<p>Do the other nations vaccinate less than the US because their health care systems are worse? &nbsp; Annoyingly (if you're an American) all of their health care outcomes rank better.</p>
<p>Is the US health care system more corruptible by industry influence?</p>
<p>Is the story a lot simpler and less sinister? &nbsp;That the US vaccinates more than the rest of these countries because the balance of the US's health care system (access to treatment, quality of treatment) is worse?&nbsp; Or is it because having to stay home with a kid that's sick with chicken pox (varicella) is not so big a deal in, say, Denmark, because the social contract is more forgiving of parents who miss work?</p>
<p>Does the poorer quality of health care in the US (going by international rankings) and the lower tolerance for parents missing work combine poorly with the undue influence of industry and therefore lead to more vaccinations?</p>
<p>On the flip side of this argument: so what if we vaccinate kids against more diseases than other countries?&nbsp; Well, they're not free.&nbsp; They cost money to administer, and cost tears because kids hate getting shots.&nbsp; The health risks from vaccines aren't zero, either.&nbsp; Vaccines have side-effects, and sometimes they're serious.&nbsp; Those other nations (presumably) ran cost-benefit analyses too and came to different conclusions.&nbsp; It would be nice if each country showed their work. &nbsp;</p>
<p>When it comes to needles to stick my new kiddo with, I'm not really being persuaded to do more than the intersection of vaccinations between similar nations.&nbsp; The fear that a doctor is about to stick my kid with a needle because there was a meeting in a shady room between a pharma rep and a CDC official is pretty powerful. &nbsp;It doesn't seem like a strictly irrational concern either</p>",michael_b,michael_b,michael_b,

All of these approaches to teaching deep learning are tied up in first: rebuilding neural networks from the ground up, and second: using very specific techniques on toy problem sets.</p><p>After quite some time of finding this frustrating (and about a year after I wrote my own exercises for a different course where… I did basically the exact same thing) I took a minute to think about why this would be and what the challenges are in teaching this material.</p><p>Before I get into this too much I want to point out another anecdote: when working on an earlier exercise I ran some code that didn’t match what the instructions inspected. They had a loss value for a specific network and problem, and I got a different loss value. My code still ran, and my code ended up getting significantly better performance than the expectation. Something like 80% vs 73%.</p><p>Probably the difference was that some of my hyperparameters somehow were off by a little bit, or maybe I computed a different number of things between setting the random seed and doing the training. But it turns out that if you have enough data, and your hyperparameters aren’t too far off, then the network does most of the work of convergence for you. Especially if you’re using the right kind of learning rate decay and adam optimization.</p><p>This is one of the big reasons that I don’t really care about hyperparameter tuning—given a specific application it can improve performance, but it isn’t going to bridge any theoretical gaps.</p><p>What I do care about is being able to set up a new dataset on my own computer, and turn the ins and outs of that dataset into a reinforcement learning setup that has the appropriate features, like the ability to record some memories about its past environment.</p><p>If I wanted to design an automatically graded online coding exercise to teach this skill, what would I need?</p><p>First, I would need a dataset or simulation environment large enough to be used for a deep reinforcement learning problem.</p><p>Second, I would need a specific reinforcement learning framework (whether Q-learning or policy gradient or something else).</p><p>Third, I would need a way to map the dataset or environment to the framework that can be easily explained so that students can use the same mapping consistently.</p><p>Fourth, I would need a specific agent architecture to produce consistent results that I could evaluate.</p><p>Fifth, I would need to be sure the student had enough computational resources to actually execute the agent.</p><p>Sixth, I would need a reporting format that would reliably summarize the student’s actual results and send them to my evaluation server.</p><p>Not all of these tasks are difficult, but none of them are particularly easy, and they are difficult in a wide variety of ways.</p><p>The first task, getting an environment, can be solved with things like the ATARI project or TORCS, but when I personally have tried setting those up I’ve given up in the past, which means that students would be likely to give up on setting them up. Getting that working reliably across many different computers, and writing up a better tutorial for installation, is a substantial task. Not theoretically difficult but I don’t have the time in my day to do it myself.</p><p>The second task has no added difficulty—introducing a specific reinforcement learning framework in technical detail is already something I’d expect to do anyway. Though I will note, while supervised and unsupervised learning frameworks are very well documented and most frameworks follow the scikit-learn API for these tasks, reinforcement learning models haven’t been standardized in the same way and searching for ‘keras reinforcement learning’ on Google gives me a bunch of personal github accounts for results, which isn’t exactly inspiring if I’m trying to create a product that will be useful to students moving forward. That means that either I’ll have to write a framework myself, or have students write it themselves, or use something ad hoc, or change around which libraries I’m using. None of those are clean options that easily lead me to the results I want.</p><p>The third task isn’t so hard in theory, but it may be hard to evaluate. Since I can’t run every deep learning experiment on AWS (at least not if I want students to work with something actually interesting), they’ll need to be running the evaluation on their own installation of the simulator and its intersection with their own installation of the framework. If it’s too difficult, again most students will be lost (even very smart ones like me who just hate coming back to IT issues instead of deep learning issues!)</p><p>The fourth is possibly the hardest from the actual deep learning perspective. If I want to automatically evaluate submissions, I want students to produce consistent results. But if I want students to have an authentic experience, I want them to be able to experiment with hyperparameters, training times, and architectures in an unstructured way. I could just set a benchmark, but I’d have to set it high enough that it couldn’t be passed without doing the proper tuning, which might mean requiring either a lot of tuning or a lot of training that makes the process slow. I could require that it runs in a certain amount of time to prevent them from just building a larger network and training it much harder, but this would be difficult to monitor across different computers students may be working from. And the answers to any of these concerns may depend heavily on the task I’m asking them to attend to—if they’re playing Pong the answers might be easy, but if they’re playing Tetris the answers could be impossible.</p><p>The fifth issue could probably just be solved by giving them minimum specs for a virtual environment that I provide a download link for… but those minimum specs probably will need to end up being &gt;8GB of RAM which could be limiting (it certainly excludes students who work from a library and may also exclude say, kids who are working on their parent’s computer)</p><p>And the final sixth issue is a combination technical-pedagogical issue that can’t even really be addressed without answers to numbers 2, 3, and 4.</p><p>It’s not very interesting to look at a powerpoint slide saying “if you’ve seen humans get performance with .5% error, and your algorithm has 1% test set error and 2% dev set error, what sorts of tuning should you be doing?” and I would much rather actually have that error and try different tuning methods and see what helps.</p><p>But when I actually step back and look at what the instructor would need to do in order to reliably put me in that situation so that they can predict the consequences of my actions and make sure I’m learning something that will be applicable outside of that specific problem…</p><p>I guess I can understand why the thing I want doesn’t already exist.</p></div></div></div></div>",magfrump,magfrump,magfrump,

<p>B(0) and B(1) can be operated by <strong>H</strong>, while X can be operated by an outside observer. <strong>H</strong> will initially press button B(0); if ever X is pressed, the agent will switch to pressing B(1). If X is pressed again, the agent will switch back to pressing B(0), and so on. After a large number of turns N, <strong>H</strong> will shut off. That's the full algorithm for <strong>H</strong>.</p>
<p>So the question is, what are the values/preferences/rewards of <strong>H</strong>? There are three natural reward functions that are plausible:</p>
<ul>
<li>R(0), which is linear in the number of times B(0) is pressed.</li>
<li>R(1), which is linear in the number of times B(1) is pressed.</li>
<li>R(2) = I(E,X)R(0) + I(O,X)R(1), where I(E,X) is the indicator function for X being pressed an even number of times,I(O,X)=1-I(E,X) being the indicator function for X being pressed an odd number of times.</li>
</ul>
<p>For R(0), we can interpret <strong>H</strong> as an R(0) maximising agent which X overrides. For R(1), we can interpret <strong>H</strong> as an R(1) maximising agent which X releases from constraints. And R(2) is the ""<strong>H</strong> is always fully rational"" reward. Semantically, these make sense for the various R(i)'s being a true and natural reward, with X=""coercive brain surgery"" in the first case, X=""release <strong>H</strong> from annoying social obligations"" in the second, and X=""switch which of R(0) and R(1) gives you pleasure"".</p>
<p>But note that there is no semantic implications here, all that we know is <strong>H</strong>, with its full algorithm. If we wanted to deduce its true reward for the purpose of something like Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL), what would it be?</p>
<h1>Modelling human (ir)rationality and reward</h1>
<p>Now let's talk about the preferences of an actual human. We all know that humans are not always rational (how exactly we know this is a very interesting question that I will be digging into). But even if humans were fully rational, the fact remains that we are physical, and vulnerable to things like coercive brain surgery (and in practice, to a whole host of other more or less manipulative techniques). So there will be the equivalent of ""button X"" that overrides human preferences. Thus, ""not immortal and unchangeable"" is in practice enough for the agent to be considered ""not fully rational"".</p>
<p>Now assume that we've thoroughly observed a given human h (including their internal brain wiring), so we know the human policy π(h) (which determines their actions in all circumstances). This is, in practice all that we can ever observe - once we know π(h) perfectly, there is nothing more that observing h can teach us (ignore, just for the moment, the question of the internal wiring of h's brain - that might be able to teach us more, but we'll need extra assumptions).</p>
<p>Let R be a possible human reward function, and <strong>R</strong> the set of such rewards. A human (ir)rationality <em>planning algorithm</em> p (hereafter refereed to as a planner), is a map from <strong>R</strong> to the space of policies (thus p(R) says how a human with reward R will actually behave - for example, this could be bounded rationality, rationality with biases, or many other options). Say that the pair (a,R) is compatible if p(R)=π(h). Thus a human with planner p and reward R would behave as h does.</p>
<p>What possible compatible pairs are there? Here are some candidates:</p>
<ul>
<li>(p(0), R(0)), where p(0) and R(0) are some ""plausible"" or ""acceptable"" planner and reward functions (what this means is a big question).</li>
<li>(p(1), R(1)), where p(1) is the ""fully rational"" planner, and R(1) is a reward that fits to give the required policy.</li>
<li>(p(2), R(2)), where R(2)= -R(1), and p(2)= -p(1), where -p(R) is defined as p(-R); here p(2) is the ""fully anti-rational"" planner.</li>
<li>(p(3), R(3)), where p(3) maps all rewards to π(h), and R(3) is trivial and constant.</li>
<li>(p(4), R(4)), where p(4)= -p(0) and R(4)= -R(0).</li>
</ul>
<h1>Distinguishing among compatible pairs</h1>
<p>How can we distinguish between compatible pairs? At first appearance, we can't. That's because, by their definition of compatible, all pairs produce the correct policy π(h). And once we have π(h), further observations of h tell us nothing.</p>
<p>I initially thought that Kolmogorov or algorithmic complexity might help us here. But in fact:</p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong>: The pairs (p(i), R(i)), i ≥ 1, are either simpler than (p(0), R(0)), or differ in Kolmogorov complexity from it by a constant that is independent of (p(0), R(0)).</p>
<p><strong>Proof</strong>: The cases of i=4 and i=2 are easy, as these differ from i=0 and i=1 by two minus signs. Given (p(0), R(0)), a fixed-length algorithm computes π(h). Then a fixed length algorithm defines p(3) (by mapping input to π(h)). Furthermore, given π(h) and any history η, a fixed length algorithm computes the action a(η) the agent will take; then a fixed length algorithm defines R(1)(η,a(η))=1 and R(1)(η,b)=0 for b≠a(η).</p>

<p>So the Kolmogorov complexity can shift between p and R (all in R for i=1,2, all in p for i=3), but it seems that the complexity of the <em>pair</em> doesn't go up during these shifts.</p>
<p>This is puzzling. It seems that, in principle, one cannot assume anything about h's reward at all! R(2)= -R(1), R(4)= -R(0), and p(3) is compatible with any possible reward R. If we give up the assumption of human rationality - which we must - it seems we can't say anything about the human reward function. So it seems IRL must fail.</p>
<p>Yet, in practice, we can and do say a lot about the rationality and reward/desires of various human beings. We talk about ourselves being irrational, as well as others being so. How do we do this? What structure do we need to assume, and is there a way to get AIs to assume the same?</p>
<p>This the question I'll try and partially answer in subsequent posts, using the example of the anchoring bias as a motivating example. The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring"">anchoring bias</a> is one of the clearest of all biases; what is it that allows us to say, with such certainty, that it's a bias (or at least a misfiring heuristic) rather than an odd reward function?</p>

A model lets me make predictions and inferences. A model produces &quot;tastes&quot;—intuitive senses that draw me towards or away from things in the world. If I engage my <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/l22/how_to_learn_soft_skills/"">Inner Simulator</a>, booted up with a model, it will produce expectations or at least positive or negative feelings that point towards my expectations—&quot;gut reactions&quot;. Models also produce curiosities and questions—my models often have holes, and when I notice a relevant hole, I get curious in order to fill it.</p><p>//</p><p>Striking closer to the core, there is a Reason that having correct beliefs is Important with a capital I, and being connected to that Reason is what will help you stay on course.</p><p>It is hard to pinpoint and name the Reason. (I was kind of surprised to find this. It feels like it&#x27;s supposed to be obvious.)</p><p>There&#x27;s a bunch of social things I&#x27;m motivated by:</p><ul><li><p>People being nice to me</p></li><li><p>People saying good things about me</p></li><li><p>People liking my ideas</p></li><li><p>People appreciating me and paying attention to me</p></li><li><p>Feeling better than other people</p></li></ul><p>These often feel relevant and important too.

(Spoilers ahead)</p><p>... </p><p>When Ender was fighting the final battle against the buggers?</p><p>And he didn&#x27;t realize he was even doing that until afterward.</p><p>There was a way it was important to be right—right about the territory, in those moments. And it was pretty much ingrained in his bones, this importance, even without knowing the larger consequences of the situation. But he also knew which things were more important to be right about and thus was able to ignore the things that weren&#x27;t important.</p><p>That said, maybe he should&#x27;ve noticed his confusion at the different setup, the shift in atmosphere. He managed to get deeply connected to one layer of relevance but was disconnected from the one wrapped around it.</p><p>//</p><p>OK, it&#x27;s possible this was all obvious.</p><p>Here are a few things that might be less immediate.</p><p>1. In a collaborative truth-seeking environment, how confidently you present should correlate with how much model you&#x27;re working with. It should also correlate with how relevant your model is to the thing at hand. So you have your own internal models of the world and also a model of what&#x27;s going on in the conversation / what other people care about / why are we talking about this. And your confidence should signal how well you&#x27;re calibrated with both those.</p><p>2. Being wrong in front of other people isn&#x27;t supposed to be embarrassing. Being wrong about a thing is a moment to check whether you might have been even more wrong than you&#x27;d been signaling. Being significantly more wrong than you were signaling is embarrassing. Being wrong about irrelevant facts is zero embarrassing, and being able to tell which facts are the ones worth getting embarrassed over is closer to the thing.</p><p>3. If checking for models turns into yet another way to assess whether people are good/bad/doing it right/whatever, <a href=""https://stepsandleaps.wordpress.com/2017/10/17/feynmans-breakthrough-disregard-others/"">it&#x27;s still missing the point</a>. It&#x27;s not about assessing people (this is just a useful proxy). It&#x27;s about trying to tell what we&#x27;re trying to do at any given moment and whether we&#x27;ve lost the way and also whether our group cognition is properly online.</p><p>4. It&#x27;s okay to have conversations that aren&#x27;t about truth-seeking and are just about sharing facts or news or trying to look smart or whatever. It&#x27;s just good to keep them as separate bins in your mind, and hopefully no one else is getting confused. I think it&#x27;s actively good to have the latter kind of conversation.</p><p>5. It is a bit dangerous for people to reveal how little model they actually have—they might get excluded for this reason. Or, even if they have models, they might get excluded if they continuously fail to convey this, for whatever reason. So there is a serious reason to avoid a super-frank truth-seeking situation where it becomes clear to everyone what models each person is bringing to the table. (I feel this anxiety a lot.)</p><p>6. The conflation between &#x27;making contributions&#x27; and &#x27;worth as a human being&#x27; causes a lot of pain. It gets worse the less trust there is, but larger inferential gaps tend to lower ability to build trust, and closing inferential gaps is hard and time-consuming ... but it&#x27;s hard to trust that as an excuse. I think this is one of the Hard Problems.</p><p style=""text-align:center;""><em>[ Originally posted on Facebook, contains minor edits ]</em></p></div></div></div></div>",Unreal,unreal,Unreal,

I do think they have different functions from each other, but that&#x27;s not the focus of this post. ]</p><p>In some cases, a person feeling guilty will be motivated to change their behavior and then do so.</p><p>For example, shame recently got me to learn how to stop slamming car doors. I got multiple external signals that people don&#x27;t like their car doors being slammed, and that I tend to slam them. So, feeling kind of bad, I <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/o7c/making_intentions_concrete_triggeraction_planning/"">installed a TAP</a> to &quot;summon sapience&quot; whenever I close car doors and started practicing another way to close car doors. (I make my hand follow the car door all the way to a close.)</p><p>But I didn&#x27;t really signal outwardly to anyone else that I was feeling shame, in particular not to any of my Lyft drivers.

I definitely <em>felt</em> lots of guilt/shame, so it showed up in my face and my body language (the signaling part). But it didn&#x27;t result in a direct fix. It resulted in avoidance. </p><p>When I realized this—that feeling guilt/shame wasn&#x27;t actually fixing the thing—my approach to guilt/shame changed.</p><p>Now I kind of &quot;do guilt/shame less.&quot; I do something else.

(I doubt it would have gotten this far as an emotion if its only function was signaling. I suspect it is, in fact, useful for getting people to change their behavior in reasonable and healthy ways.)</p><p>But now we have some people who go around using guilt/shame in the reasonable way. And people like me whose guilt/shame mechanism backfired more often than not and thus just mostly stopped using it. (It was really unhealthy for me and likely led to years of depression.)</p><p>But because Typical Mind Fallacy is a thing, people just treat others the way they&#x27;d treat themselves.</p><p>A person with guilt/shame in their repertoire will use tactics to try to trigger the mechanistic guilt/shame reaction in me, thinking it will work fine.

Why are you sending me these empty signals?&quot; And in my head, I start <em>doubting</em> that they will in fact fix the thing after all. Because in my head, signs of guilt anti-correlate with actually fixing the thing.</p><p>We can see how this might go poorly.</p><p>~</p><p>Without guilt/shame, there has to be some other way to convince people that I&#x27;m going to change and fix my mistakes. Guilt/shame works because it&#x27;s a costly signal (it feels bad).

CSMcP was making a broad claim of the form &quot;categorical psych tools are bad,&quot; which is both a) reasonable and b) in context the sort of claim Scott sighs about in his excellent post Yes We Have Noticed The Skulls. It was a knee-jerk, base-rate, cached objection to an entire category of Thing based on that category being generally bad/useless/misleading, when the post in question was about a specific instance, started out with a link to Fake Frameworks, made explicit bids to be treated fresh/in good faith, and was written as the 29th entry in a series of posts that have been generally agreed to contain non-zero value and rationalist virtue.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The comment above implicitly (and maybe clumsily) made the claim &quot;I suspect you&#x27;re only using your generally sensible prior, and I think it&#x27;s better in this case to construct a posterior that combines your generally sensible prior in a rational way with awareness of the source and context.&quot;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Regardless of whether the posterior ends up being &quot;yeah, still bullshit&quot; or &quot;maybe I&#x27;ll give this more charity than I otherwise would have,&quot; the requested operation &quot;instead of just commenting using your base rate, combine your base rate with your sense of whether a given person has demonstrated &#x27;worth listening to&#x27; nature&quot; is one that LessWrongers should absolutely engage in, on the regular.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>i.e. I strongly believe that the thrust of the comment (&quot;You&#x27;re leaving out context that a LWer ought not leave out, and this is somewhat undermining the point you&#x27;re trying to make&quot;) is correct, defensible, and prosocial given the community&#x27;s goals. I think it was innocuous at worst, and definitely not the sort of thing that ought to be in negative territory. I&#x27;m taking it as an instance of a class, and making an impassioned defense of other comments in its class, and saying &quot;Don&#x27;t downvote these.&quot;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>If LessWrongers in general are inclined to downvote one member making a request of this sort of another member (&quot;please engage in the kind of double-check we know humans often need and which is not costly to perform&quot;), this does not reflect well on the explicit goal of building a community where solid epistemic norms are incentivized. If LessWrongers in general have a bucket error that makes them e.g. treat the above comment as a status move or a clumsy attempt to argue from authority (rather than as a bid for people to use their System 2 to do Bayesian updating on whether or not a source has indeed demonstrated itself credible, and to what degree, or not), this does not reflect well on the question of whether our average member is Actually Doing The Thing.]</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Edit: user Vaniver made an insightful reply to a symmetrical case above, which I appreciated and endorse.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Referenced other comments: </strong></p><p><em>CoolshirtMcPants: </em></p><blockquote><p>Grouping things into categories seems like a great way to form biases and have a limited scope of how to think about people. Do we really need to have another system that categorizes personalities?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>This might seem like a harsh example, but horoscopes is an example of what this system reminds me of.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The overall picture I see with this, is that we are giving limited value to a word that could mean many things, and could be interpreted in many ways, when most things are more complex than this (especially people). Basically, it seems to me to be a vague way to express something. I personally am of the mindset that it&#x27;s of a benefit to not group people into categories.</p></blockquote><p><em>gjm: </em></p><blockquote><p>So, let&#x27;s suppose astrologers have come up with 12 personality types, and then they claim to be able to tell which one fits you best by careful consideration of your date and time of birth. It seems to me that the big problem there is with the second half, not the first. (Even bigger problems if they claim to be able to use the information to predict what&#x27;s going to happen to you, of course.) But the second half is exactly what isn&#x27;t present in Conor&#x27;s analysis here.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>I don&#x27;t know whether the advantages of having a small number of personality archetypes and pigeonholing people as combinations of those archetypes outweigh the disadvantages. Nor do I have any opinion worth listening to about whether the particular set of 5 archetypes described here is a particularly good one. But &quot;it resembles one thing astrologers do&quot; is not a good argument against it.</p></blockquote><p><em>CoolShirtMcPants: </em></p><blockquote><p>You did mention making useful predictions with your 5 color types, which was why I wasn&#x27;t afraid to go with horoscopes as an example.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>That&#x27;s paraphrase seems to have taken quite a leap in what I was trying to say. I can elaborate if you&#x27;d like. It&#x27;s just that this post doesn&#x27;t appear much different from other personality tests that group people into categories. Psychology used to have a similar approach of trying to categorize people, but as they make more advance and learn how different everybody is from each other. They have learned to have a more open approach to people rather than a category to put them in and work from a bias to determine what steps to do next.</p></blockquote><p><em>Conor Moreton (referenced in comment at the top of this post): </em></p><blockquote><p>The context that&#x27;s being neglected in your comment is &quot;Conor&#x27;s clearly put a lot of thought and cycles into rationality, and staked a specific claim that this one&#x27;s better/more useful in practice than all the other wrong-but-usefuls.&quot;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>You&#x27;re saying &quot;it doesn&#x27;t appear much different,&quot; which is a fine hypothesis to have, but it doesn&#x27;t engage with whether or not my voucher provides useful Bayesian evidence.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Separate thread:</strong></p><p><em>habryka (reply to comment referenced at the top of this post): </em></p><blockquote><p>I downvoted your last three comment, but sadly don&#x27;t currently have time to go into a longer explanation of why, since I expect it would take a while and I have a bunch of deadlines the next few days.

We see this with &quot;react&quot; and &quot;respond&quot;, which both roughly have a meaning of &quot;do something because something else happened&quot;, but each of which carries its own implications about the how the doing is done.</p><p>&quot;Respond&quot; is the older word so we&#x27;ll start with it. It <a href=""http://www.etymonline.com/word/respond"">comes</a> from Latin through French and is constructed from the roots &quot;re-&quot; and &quot;spondere&quot;. &quot;Re-&quot; serves like &quot;back&quot; in its prepositional sense in English as in &quot;go back there&quot; or &quot;do it back to him&quot; and is synonymous with &quot;in return&quot;. &quot;Spondere&quot; means &quot;to pledge&quot;, but over time &quot;respond&quot; morphed to mean something less like &quot;make a pledge back&quot; and more like &quot;answer back&quot; or &quot;answer in return&quot;. The result is our modern word &quot;respond&quot; that connotes a deliberate action made in return to another one, carrying some but not all of the original weight of &quot;pledge&quot; with it.</p><p>&quot;React&quot; is newer.  It <a href=""http://www.etymonline.com/word/react"">first appears</a> in the 1640s in the <a href=""http://www.finedictionary.com/react.html"">sense</a> of a physical reaction from &quot;re-&quot; plus &quot;act&quot; from Latin &quot;actus&quot; which <a href=""http://www.etymonline.com/word/act"">itself</a> draws from Proto-Indo-European &quot;*ag-&quot; which covers the notions of driving, drawing out or forth, and moving. So we can say &quot;react&quot; is to &quot;move in return&quot; to another movement, and it carries that sense through today in a generalized way as both the word we use to talk about what chemicals do when they are &quot;moved&quot; to react and the immediate return actions people make when acted upon.</p><p>Together &quot;react&quot; and &quot;respond&quot; create a dimension along we can describe what is done in return. Specifically, we more call those things &quot;reactions&quot; that are done quickly, automatically, or without deliberation and more call those things &quot;responses&quot; that are done carefully, voluntarily, or with deliberation. To give an example, suppose you go to see a movie about factory farming. While watching it you  <em>react</em> with disgust, horror, indifference, etc. and may even post about your feelings on social media. After you think about what you saw, though, you may <em>respond</em> to it by changing your behavior or talking about why you think it was distasteful content to show. In this way &quot;react&quot; and &quot;respond&quot; roughly correspond to System 1 and System 2 generating action in return to experiences, respectively.</p><p>But that&#x27;s just a first gloss because I think <a href=""https://mapandterritory.org/a-foundation-for-the-multipart-psyche-79a66292a7a"">the S1/S2 distinction is confounded</a> and something more is going. When &quot;react&quot; and &quot;respond&quot; are construed as I have construed them above, most people (especially the sort of people who read LW) would say they would prefer to &quot;respond&quot; to &quot;react&quot;. That is, they would prefer to think before choosing an action rather than autonomically acting. Yet, no matter what we do, we will have some autonomic reaction, even if it is the &quot;null&quot; reaction of disregard, so even if we want to wait to respond we must react in some way first. Thus we get at one of the core challenges in rationality: how to react so that we may respond.</p><p>Since we already have mathematical models that mostly tell us how to respond if we have enough resources, even if we rarely or never have access to those resources and so must respond in suboptimal ways, it&#x27;s tempting to create a space where reactions don&#x27;t count and only responses matter. But to me that seems a dream because for the time being we are all humans and we all react to others reactions, so even if we try to suppress reactions we cannot escape them. Thus it seems we have no choice but to react, and if we must react, it seems to me we might as well react in ways that accord with how we would respond.</p><p>So as much as rationality feels like a System 2 or far construal mode activity, it ultimately makes demands on System 1 and near construal mode thinking. As such we must engage with <a href=""https://www.lesserwrong.com/posts/yPfwMoxyRX77DARjM/gnostic-rationality"">gnosis or personal experience of rationality</a> if we want our reactions to align with our responses and to do the things that <a href=""https://www.lesserwrong.com/posts/4ARtkT3EYox3THYjF/rationality-is-systematized-winning"">actually win</a> rather than <a href=""http://mindingourway.com/there-is-no-try/"">merely try</a>. It seems only in this way that we may learn to react so that we may respond.</p></div></div></div></div>",gworley,gordon-seidoh-worley,Gordon Seidoh Worley,

Until recently, I had only really thought about when System 2 ought to override System 1, but I believe other cases are worth considering as well.</p><p>It is important to be able to get System 2 to shut up and let System 1 work in certain circumstances. Physical movement is an excellent example of this. When you shoot a basketball, throw a football, or use a video game controller you may notice that when you are “on fire” you are not focusing at all on the mechanics of what you are doing. In fact, if you start thinking about what you are doing better than usual and begin analyzing the mechanics of the movements, you will likely begin performing worse. Similarly, when you focus on some specific motion that is supposed to contribute to a correct movement, applying the conscious effort of System 2 to force yourself to do it, you will generally exhibit worse performance than if you just hold an image in your mind of what the movement should generally look like.</p><p>The override of System 2 causes you to neglect other important factors that go into a movement: and there are too many for system 2 to think about at once. The strength of System 1 is that it can handle all those factors without trouble.</p><p>Thus, we can see where it is important to learn the skill of not trying too hard or focusing conscious attention too forcefully. We often cannot consciously keep in mind all the necessary factors, though we are capable subconsciously, as long as System 2 does not interfere with the process by introducing an override in one specific area. While learning this skill, it is important that one not try too hard to not try too hard. Thus, it can be a very difficult skill to learn, I think particularly for analytical people. See <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003T0G9E4/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1"">The Inner Game of Tennis</a> for a more thorough exposition of this idea.</p><p>The skill of effortless effort, is a very useful one, though, I think, not quite as important as learning how to get your mind to actually try, with System 2 reevaluating the lazy heuristics of System 1, which is one of the necessary skills for long term rational decision making. System 2 overriding System 1 is necessary for dealing with many cognitive biases. To avoid allowing representativeness to alter my judgment of what someone does for a living based on a description of them, I must avoid the impulse to merely match the description with a relevant stereotype and output an answer. System 2 must recognize the need to apply base rates and Bayes Theorem, and remember that base rates are probably better evidence of what someone does than the stereotypes that mesh best with a possibly unreliable description. LessWrong is full of other examples of when this skill is important and why.</p><p>Then there is the skill of using both systems in unison, each doing the job it can do well and not interfering with the job of the other system and worsening overall performance.</p><p>Take a martial artist as he fights his opponent. He must allow his System 1 to handle the mechanics of how his body moves—the complexities that he has trained for throwing a perfect punch are far more numerous than he consciously is aware. If he focuses too hard on one particular aspect of the strike, such as proper shoulder rotation in his punch, he may lose fluidity, speed, or power. System 2 must not focus on how he performs each strike. At the same time System 2 is very active, evaluating his opponent’s movements, her favored strikes, how she responds to feints. System 2 creates plans for exploiting any perceived weakness. And in this area System 1 must not enter, System 1 sees a fight and becomes angry, abandons caution and begins using too much power, a mode of fighting that will be quickly punished by an experienced opponent. </p><p>When the two are in balance, the martial artist will experience a state of transcendence, other concerns falling away as all attention is focused on the challenge in front of him. I have found this sort of experience tends to provide the greatest fun density per time as compared to anything else I do.</p><p>I am not sure if this is the most important of the skills, I think getting System 2 to rethink System 1’s overly hasty judgments is still likely more important if one has goals other and higher than personal enjoyment. But getting both systems working together in unison feels the best of any of the skills and I think engaging in activities that allow for both to be used may be an excellent way of increasing the amount of fun you have in the limited time you have to spend. </p><p></p></div></div></div></div>",Rossin,rossin,Rossin,

For a long time this was mysterious to me. Then a friend provided a possible explanation that completely changed how I look at it. As I explained to my friend, the problem isn&#x27;t that the person giving advice isn&#x27;t trustworthy, quite often the person asking wants the advice and trusts the opinion of the person giving it. So why don&#x27;t they follow it? My friend hypothesized that people let their identity get mixed up in how they wanted to do the thing, and then can&#x27;t bring themselves to do it another way. Essentially his hypothesis is that they&#x27;re being asked to change too much. This seems plausible enough, but it got me thinking more broadly about what scope of advice people are looking for when they ask.</p><p>To start <a href=""https://blog.udemy.com/planning-in-management/"">we can imagine four modes of planning</a>, divided thusly:</p><ul><li><p>    <strong>Mission</strong> - What you are trying to accomplish.</p></li><li><p>    <strong>Strategic Planning</strong> - What broad goals you intend to satisfy to get there.</p></li><li><p>    <strong>Tactical Planning</strong> - Concrete near term objectives which will let you satisfy the strategic goals.</p></li><li><p>    <strong>Operational Planning</strong> - The absolute lowest levels of getting the work done, who will do what, what needs to be done to make tactics work, etc. </p></li></ul><p>The hierarchy of willingness to take advice then is basically a mirror image of this.</p><ul><li><p>    <strong>Unwilling</strong> - The zeroth level. The one receiving advice is willing to change nothing based on what counsel they are given.</p></li><li><p>    <strong>Operational Advice</strong> (&quot;Use this kind of bolt.&quot;) - The one receiving advice would like to hear suggestions on how to accomplish the task they&#x27;ve already set for themselves, but aren&#x27;t particularly interested in hearing what tasks make sense in the service of what goals. This is probably what most people asking for advice actually want.</p></li><li><p>    <strong>Tactical Advice</strong> (&quot;The car should have four wheels.&quot;) - Given a set of broad goals, the one receiving advice is open for suggestions on how they should go about trying to accomplish them. This might mean for example that significant deviations from the original plan are allowed as long as they better serve the goals which the action is going towards. Most advice I give is on this level whether it&#x27;s asked for or not.</p></li><li><p>    <strong>Strategic Advice</strong> (&quot;You should build a car.&quot;) - Very close to being the most open to radically plan changing advice. Here the one receiving advice is willing to accept that the goals they&#x27;ve decided on to pursue their mission are flawed, or perhaps not the best goals they could set for accomplishing the mission. This kind of advice is usually only solicited at the outset of a project, at least for a while. Once a project is in motion the inertia to change these becomes much higher, as a consequence people can persist in doing stupid things for essentially rational reasons even after it&#x27;s been laboriously pointed out to them why the thing is dumb.</p></li><li><p>    <strong>Mission Advice</strong> (&quot;You should build a high speed transportation machine.&quot;) - Here the one receiving advice is open to the idea that the thing they are trying to accomplish, may not even be the right thing to go after at all. This is probably the rarest kind of advice to be followed, and the rarest to be solicited once a project is in motion. Examples might include certain kinds of Effective Altruist activism that tries to convince people to quit their mediocre job and become an investment banker so they can donate the money to charity. Or maybe if in the course of trying to accomplish strategic goals an organization falls so far below what it hoped to accomplish that it begins to make more sense to &#x27;pivot&#x27;. </p></li></ul><p>The takeaway for you dear reader is that you should try to be cognizant of what kind of advice you&#x27;re looking for. To get better advice it may help to explicitly communicate your preference to the person you&#x27;re soliciting from. You&#x27;re liable to make your peers quite angry if they give you solid strategic advice and you persist in the same basic inoptimal tactics towards your goals.</p><p><code>(This post was originally published at </code><a href=""https://namespace.obormot.net/Main/FourScopesOfAdvice""><code>https://namespace.obormot.net/Main/FourScopesOfAdvice</code></a><code>.

Will it explode off into infinity as it finds better ways to improve itself or will it be a slower more manageable process?  There are a number of productive ways we can react to this, not limited to: </p><ol><li><p>Attempt to make AI systems controllable by focusing on the<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_control_problem""> control problem</a></p></li><li><p>Attempt to predict when we might get agi by looking at progress, e.g. a<a href=""https://aiimpacts.org/"">i impacts</a></p></li><li><p>Attempt to predict what happens when we get artificial general intelligence by looking at current artificial intelligences and current general intelligences and making predictions about the intersection.</p></li><li><p>Figure out how to make intelligence augmentation, so we can improve humans abilities to compete with full AGI agents.</p></li></ol><p>This blog post is looking at the third option.  It is important, because the only reason we think AGIs might exist is the existence proof of humans. Computer AGI might be vastly different in capabilities but we can&#x27;t get any direct information about them, our only possible approach to predicting their capability is to adjust our estimate of what humans can do based on the difference between humans and narrow AI on different tasks and those tasks importance for economically important generality.</p><p>There are three core questions to AGI Estimation that I have identified so far.</p><ol><li><p>What do we mean by &#x27;general intelligence&#x27;</p></li><li><p>How important is &#x27;general intelligence&#x27; to different economic activities</p></li><li><p>How good are narrow AIs at parts of the processes involved in general intelligence vs humans. Can we estimate how good an AGI would be at another task based on the comparison?</p></li></ol><h3>Generality</h3><p>We often speak and act as if there is something to one person being better than another person and mental acts in general. We try and measure it with IQ, we think there is something there. However there are a number of different things &quot;general intelligence&quot; might actually be each of which might lead to better performance, while still being general in some way. </p><ol><li><p>Better at tasks in general</p></li><li><p>Better at absorbing information by experimentation, so that per bit of information the task performance improves quicker</p></li><li><p> Better at holding more complex behaviours, so that the limit of task performance is higher </p></li><li><p>Better at understanding verbal and cultural information, so that they can improve tasks performance by absorbing the information about tasks acquired by other people.</p></li><li><p>Better in general at figuring out the relevant information and how it should be formatted/collected, so they can select the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm_shift"">correct paradigm</a> for solving a problem.</p></li></ol><p>Number 1 seems trivially untrue. So we shouldn&#x27;t worry about a super intelligent AGI system automatically being better at persuading people, unless it has been fed the right information. You don&#x27;t know what the right information is for a super intelligence to get good at persuading, so probably still worth while being paranoid.</p><p>My bet is that &quot;generally better&quot; is a normally a mixture of aspects 2-4 (which feed into each other), but different aspects will dominate in different aspects of economic activity. Let us take physics for an example, I suspect that a humans potential is more limited by 4, the ability to read and understand other people research, now that we have super computers that can be programmed so that complex simulations can be off loaded from the human brain (so 3 is less important).  If we throw more processing power and compute at the &quot;general intelligence&quot; portion of physics and this mainly improve 4, then we should expect it to get up to speed on the state of the art of physics a lot more quickly than humans, but not necessarily get better with more data. If 5 can be improved in &quot;general&quot; then we should expect a super intelligent AGI physicist to have a completely different view point on physics and experimentation in short order to humans.</p><p>We can look at this by looking at task performance in humans, if someone can be a lot better at absorbing information over a large number of tasks, then we should expect AGIs to be able to vary a lot on this scale. If humans general task performance variation depends heavily on being able to access the internet/books, then we don&#x27;t have good grounds for expecting computers to go beyond humanities knowledge easily, unless we get indication from narrow AI that it is better at something like absorbing information.</p><p>Before getting into the other question I will illustrate what I mean by the different sorts of generality. I&#x27;ll build off a simple model of human knowledge that <a href=""http://matt.might.net/"">Matt Might</a> used to explain what grad school is like can be found <a href=""http://matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/"">here.</a> We can imagine different ways an AGI might be better than a human at filling in the circle.</p><p>They could be fast at filling in the circle without humans help (2), be able to keep more of the circle in mind at once (3).  They could be fast at filling in the circle with human culture (4a) or be able to fill more of the circle from human culture (4b). If they are faster at doing PhD level work, in general, they will expand the knowledge more (5). At some point I will put in-line diagrams or animations of the differences.</p><p>Knowing which of these facets humans change upon most and have the most impact on ability to get things done, seems pretty important.</p><h3>Improving Generality and Economic Activity</h3><p>However we are not interested in all tasks we are mainly interested in the ones that lead to greater economic activity and impact upon the world.</p><p>So we need to ask how important human brains are in economic activity in general, to know how much impact improving them would have. </p><p>For example for programming a computer (an important task in recursive self-improvement), how big a proportion of the time spent in the task is the humans intelligence vs total task. For example when an AI researcher is trying to improve an algorithm how much time of making a new algorithm variant is needed for thinking vs running the algorithm with different parameters. For example if it takes 3 days for a new variant of AlphaGo Zero, to train itself and be tested and 1 day for the human to analyse the result and tweak the algorithm, speeding up the human portion of the process 1000 fold won&#x27;t have a huge impact. This is especially the case if the AGI  is not appreciably better at aspect 2 of  &#x27;generalness&#x27;, it will still need as many iterations of running AlphaGo Zero as a human to be able to improve it. <br/> </p><h3>The impact of what are we improving</h3><p>This brings us to the question, when we create super human narrow AI systems which aspect of the system are super to human. Is it the ability to absorb knowledge, the amount of knowledge the system has been given (as it can be given knowledge more quickly than humans) or is it able to hold a more complex model than we can hold in our heads?</p><p>If we determine that the aspects that are super human are those that are very important for different economic activities and the aspects that we have not improved are not important, then we should increase our expectation of the impact of AGI. This should hopefully not make us too provincial in our predictions about what AGI should be capable of doing. </p><p>A first stab at the kind of reasoning that I want to attempt is <a href=""https://www.lesserwrong.com/posts/shnSyzv4Jq3bhMNw5/alphago-zero-and-the-foom-debate/QdeKEBhcosBS3aPhk"">here</a> where I attempt to look at how quickly Alpha Go Zero learns compared to humans based on number of games played. This might be a bad comparison, but if it is we should try and improve upon it.</p><h3><br/>Conclusion<br/></h3><p>I have outlined a potential method for gaining information about AGI that relies on mainly experiments on human task performance. <br/>We do not have lots of options when it comes to getting information about AGI so we should evaluate all possible ways of getting information.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>",,,,

Yesterday he reposted that here (<a href=""https://www.lesserwrong.com/posts/shnSyzv4Jq3bhMNw5/alphago-zero-and-the-foom-debate"">link</a>), minus my responses. So I’ve composed the following response to put here: </p><p>I have agreed that an AI-based economy could grow faster than does our economy today. The issue is how fast the abilities of one AI system might plausibly grow, relative to the abilities of the entire rest of the world at that time, across a range of tasks roughly as broad as the world economy. Could one small system really “foom” to beat the whole rest of the world?</p><p>As many have noted, while AI has often made impressive and rapid progress in specific narrow domains, it is much less clear how fast we are progressing toward human level AGI systems with scopes of expertise as broad as those of the world economy. Averaged over all domains, progress has been slow. And at past rates of progress, I have estimated that it might take centuries. </p><p>Over the history of computer science, we have developed many general tools with simple architectures and built from other general tools, tools that allow super human performance on many specific tasks scattered across a wide range of problem domains. For example, we have superhuman ways to sort lists, and linear regression allows superhuman prediction from simple general tools like matrix inversion.  </p><p>Yet the existence of a limited number of such tools has so far been far from sufficient to enable anything remotely close to human level AGI. Alpha Go Zero is (or is built from) a new tool in this family, and its developers deserve our praise and gratitude. And we can expect more such tools to be found in the future. But I am skeptical that it is the last such tool we will need, or even remotely close to the last such tool. </p><p>For specific simple tools with simple architectures, architecture can matter a lot. But our robust experience with software has been that even when we have access to many simple and powerful tools, we solve most problems via complex combinations of simple tools. Combinations so complex, in fact, that our main issue is usually managing the complexity, rather than including the right few tools. In those complex systems, architecture matters a lot less than does lots of complex detail. That is what I meant by suggesting that architecture isn’t the key to AGI. </p><p>You might claim that once we have enough good simple tools, complexity will no longer be required. With enough simple tools (and some data to crunch), a few simple and relatively obvious combinations of those tools will be sufficient to perform most all tasks in the world economy at a human level. And thus the first team to find the last simple general tool needed might “foom” via having an enormous advantage over the entire rest of the world put together. At least if that one last tool were powerful enough. I disagree with this claim, but I agree that neither view can be easily and clearly proven wrong. </p><p>Even so, I don’t see how finding one more simple general tool can be much evidence one way or another. I never meant to imply that we had found all the simple general tools we would ever find. I instead suggest that simple general tools just won’t be enough, and thus finding the “last” tool required also won’t let its team foom. </p><p>The best evidence regarding the need for complexity in strong broad systems is the actual complexity observed in such systems. The human brain is arguably such a system, and when we have artificial systems of this sort they will also offer more evidence. Until then one might try to collect evidence about the distribution of complexity across our strongest broadest systems, even when such systems are far below the AGI level. But pointing out that one particular capable system happens to use mainly one simple tool, well that by itself can’t offer much evidence one way or another.</p></div></div></div></div>",RobinHanson,robinhanson,RobinHanson,

</style></head><body><p>Attempted versions of CDT and EDT can be constructed using logical inductors, called LICDT and LIEDT. It is shown, however, that LICDT fails XOR Blackmail, and LIEDT fails Newcomb. One interpretation of this is that LICDT and LIEDT do not implement CDT and EDT very well. I argue that they are indeed forms of CDT and EDT, but stray from expectations because they also implement the ratifiability condition <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1663"">I discussed previously</a>. Continuing the line of thinking from that post, I discuss conditions in which LICDT=LIEDT, and try to draw out broader implications for decision theory.</p>

<p><em>Thanks to Scott and Sam for discussions shaping this post. Also thanks to many participants at AISFP for discussions shaping my current view of counterfactuals.</em></p>
<p>I'm not sure who gets credit for LICDT and LIEDT, but they've been discussed around MIRI since shortly after logical induction itself. LIEDT was sort of the obvious first thing to try; LICDT is a slight variation. (Scott thinks Jessica may have come up with LICDT.) They might be thought of as the punching bag for better logical induction DTs to be contrasted with (although, Tsvi <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1054"">wrote up a likely-better baseline proposal</a>).</p>

The conditional expectation is always well-defined thanks to the exploration, which ensures that the probability of each action remains above zero.</p>
<p>LICDT is similar, but rather than taking the expectation conditioned on each action, it takes the expectation conditioned on <em>exploring</em> and taking that action. Judging actions by what would happen if you took those actions randomly, rather than reliably, is supposed to remove the kind of correlation which makes EDT cooperate in prisoner's dilemma, one-box in Newcomb, et cetera. We will see that this only party works.</p>
<p>Both LICDT and LIEDT include any observations in their deductive state. (There can be special predicates representing sensory states.) So, they are updateful decision theories.</p>
<p>LICDT and LIEDT aren't very different, and mostly we just talk about LIEDT, calling it LIDT. However, I'm recently realizing just how similar LICDT and LIEDT really are.</p>

This is a Newcomb problem where Omega is fallible; in fact, Omega can only predict the agent as well as the agent can predict itself, since both use the same logical inductor. (And, Newcomb deals with the uncertainty by putting the money in the box with probability equal to its estimation of the probability LIEDT one-boxes.) The best reward the agent can get is if Omega predicts one-boxing, but the agent unexpectedly two-boxes. Of course, a logical inductor can't be fooled like this reliably; so the agent is incentivised to one-box.</p>

<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> <em>LICDT converges to sending the blackmailer money when a letter is received, on non-exploration rounds.</em></p>
<p><em>Proof.</em> LICDT bases its decision on the utility observed in exploration rounds. Conditional on its receiving the letter and exploring into sending the money, no disaster has occurred. Conditional on its receiving the letter and exploring into not sending money, the disaster has occurred. It will come to predict both of these things accurately, and its conditional expectations will be consistent with them. Therefore, it will send the money. <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\Box""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-ams-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">□</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<h2>Interpretation of the two experiments.</h2>
<p>It appears that these aren't very good implementations of CDT and EDT. The attempted CDT fails blackmail letter; the attempted EDT fails Newcomb. But, if we look a little closer, something more interesting is going on. I didn't prove it here, but <em>both</em> of them will one-box when Omega is a perfect predictor, and two-box when Omega is fallible. <em>Both</em> of them will send the blackmail letter when the blackmailer is a perfect predictor, and refuse when the blackmailer is fallible. They appear to be following my ""Law of Logical Causality"" from <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1663"">SLS III</a>.</p>
<p>When people argue that EDT one-boxes in Newcomb and that CDT two-boxes, and that EDT sends the money in XOR Blackmail but EDT abstains, they often aren't careful that EDT and CDT are being given the same problem. CDT is supposed to be taking a physical-causation counterfactual, meaning it represents the problem in a Bayesian network representing its physical uncertainty, in which the direction of links lines up with physical causality. If we give EDT the same Bayesian network, it will disregard the causal information contained therein, and compute conditional utilities of actions. But, it is unclear that EDT will then one-box in Newcomb. Reasoning about the physical situation, will it really conclude that conditioning on one action or another changes the expected prediction of Omega? How does the conditional probability flow from the action to Omega? Omega's prediction is based on some observations made in the past. It may be that the agent knows equally well what those observations were; it just doesn't know exactly what Omega concluded from them. The knowledge of the observations screens off any probabilistic relationship. Or, even worse, it may be that the physical information which the agent has includes its own source code. The agent can't try to run its own source code on this very decision; it would go into an infinite loop. So, we get stuck when we try to do the reasoning. Similar problems occur in XOR blackmail.</p>
<p>I claim that reasoning about what CDT and EDT do in Newcomb's problem and XOR blackmail implicitly assume some solution to logical uncertainty. The correlation which EDT is supposed to conclude exists between its action and the predictor's guess at its action is a logical correlation. But, logical induction doesn't necessarily resolve this kind of logical uncertainty in the intuitive way.</p>
<p>In particular, logical induction implements a version of the ratifiability condition. Because LIEDT agents know their own policies, they are screened off from would-be correlates of their decisions in much the same way LICDT agents are. And because LICDT agents are learning counterfactuals by exploration, they treat predictors who have more information about their own actions than they themselves do as causally downstream -- the law of logical causality which I conjectured would, together with ratifiability, imply CDT=EDT.</p>
<h2>When does LICDT=LIEDT?</h2>
<p>It's obvious that LIEDT usually equals LICDT when LIEDT converges to taking just one of the actions on non-exploration rounds; the other actions are only taken when exploring, so LIEDT's expectation of those actions just <em>equals</em> LICDT's. What about the expectation of the main action? Well, it <em>may</em> differ, if there is a reliable difference in utility when it is taken as an exploration vs deliberately chosen. However, this seems to be in some sense unfair; the environment is basing its payoff on the agent's reasons for taking an action, rather than on the action alone. While we'd like to be able to deal with some such environments, allowing this in general allows an environment to punish one decision theory selectively. So, for now, we rule such decision problems out:</p>

<p>I don't expect that this definition is particularly good; alternatives welcome. In particular, using the inductor itself to estimate the action probability introduces an unfortunate dependence on inductor.</p>
<p>Compare to the notion of fairness in <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1031"">Asymptotic DT</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A <em>continuous fair decision problem</em> is a fair problem for which the function from limiting action probabilities to limiting expected utilities is continuous.</p>
<p><strong>Observation.</strong> Continuous fair decision problems have ""equilibrium"" action distributions, where the best response to the action utilities which come from those is consistent with the action distribution. These are the same whether ""best-response"" is in the LICDT or LIEDT sense, since the expected utility is required to be the same in both senses. If either LICDT or LIEDT converge on some such problem, then clearly they converge to one of these equilibria.</p>
<p>This doesn't necessarily mean that LICDT and LIEDT converge to the same behavior, though, since it is possible that they fail to converge, and that they converge to different equilibria. I would be somewhat surprised if there is some essential difference in behavior between LICDT and LIEDT on these problems, but I'm not sure what conjecture to state.</p>
<p>I'm more confident in a conjecture for a much narrower notion of fairness (I wasn't able to prove this, but I wouldn't be very surprised if it turned out not to be that hard to prove):</p>

<p><strong>Conjecture.</strong> Given a continuous deterministically fair decision problem, the set of mixed strategies which LICDT may converge to and LIEDT may converge to, varying the choice of logical inductor, are the same. That is, if LICDT converges to an equilibrium, we can find a logical inductor for which LIEDT converges to that same equilibrium, and vice versa.</p>
<p>This seems likely to be true, since the narrowness of the decision problem class leaves very little room to wedge the two decision theories apart.</p>
<p>The difficulty of proving comparison theorems for LICDT and LIEDT is closely related to the difficulty of proving optimality theorems for them. If we had a good characterization of the convergence and optimality conditions of these two decision theories, we would probably be in a better position to study the relationship between them.</p>
<p>At least we can prove the following fairly boring theorem:</p>
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong>  For a decision problem in which the utility depends only on the action taken, in a way which does not depend on <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""n""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">n</span></span></span></span></span></span> or on the agent, and for which all the actions have different utilities, LIEDT and LICDT will converge to the same distribution on actions.</p>
<p><em>Proof.</em> Epsilon exploration ensures that there continues to be some probability of each action, so the logical inductor will eventually learn the action utilities arbitrarily well. Once the utilities are accurate enough to put the actions in the right ordering, the agent will simply take the best action, with the exception of exploration rounds. <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\Box""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-ams-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">□</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<h2>Law of Logical Counterfactuals</h2>
<p>The interesting thing here is that LIEDT seems to be the same as LICDT under an assumption that the environment doesn't specifically mess with it by doing something differently on exploration rounds and non-exploration rounds. This is sort of obvious from the definitions of LICDT and LIEDT (despite the difficulty of actually proving the result). However, notice that it's much different from usual statements of the difference between EDT and CDT.</p>
<p>I claim that LIEDT and LICDT are more-or-less appropriately reflecting the spirit of EDT and CDT under (1) the condition of ratifiability, which is enforced by the self-knowledge properties of logical inductors, and (2) the ""law of logical counterfactuals"" (LLC) I posited last time, which is enforced by the way LICDT learns causality via experimentation. You can't learn that something which knows more about your action than you do is upstream of you if you make the assumption that you can perform randomized controlled trials!</p>
<p>Since the law of logical counterfactuals was vaguely stated, I had hoped to learn something about what shape it has to take by examining this case. Unfortunately, this case is a bit intractable. However, it did suggest an additional condition: (3) the environment's behavior doesn't depend on whether you explore. (1), (2), and (3) are stated rather informally for now, but together are supposed to imply CDT=EDT, in a formal analysis which is yet-to-be.</p>
<p>Actually, assumption (3) is a sort of ""randomized controlled trials"" assumption, which seems to justify (2). You assume that you can arrange for actions to be uncorrelated with anything in the world, and that justifies your use of exploration to learn about counterfactuals.</p>
<p>It's not obvious at first, but exploration-based counterfactuals are very similar to counterfactuals based on the chicken rule in proof-based decision theories such as MUDT. The chicken rule requires that if you can prove what your own action will be, you take a different action. This allows the proofs from alternative actions to be well-behaved, rather than exploding in contradiction.</p>
<p>You can see how that's analogous to the way epsilon-exploration makes sure that LICDT and LIEDT can condition on their own actions without dividing by zero. It's also analogous for a deeper reason. Remember the trick of using self-referential sentences for exploration, at the beginning of this writeup? A very similar trick is to take any action which the logical inductor currently assigns probability <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""<\epsilon""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">&lt;</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">ϵ</span></span></span></span></span></span>. In other words, do anything you strongly believe you won't do. This is very close to the chicken rule; just substitute probabilistic belief for proof.</p>
<p>In fact, we can go a bit further. One of the shortcomings of MUDT is that it doesn't do what we'd like in the <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=298"">Agent Simulates Predictor scenario</a>, and a host of other problems where a more powerful logic is required. We can address these issues by <em>giving</em> it a more powerful logic, but that does not address the intuitive concern, that it seems as if we should be able to solve these problems without <em>fully</em> trusting a more powerful logic: if we strongly <em>suspect</em> that the more powerful logic is consistent, we should be able to <em>mostly</em> do the same thing.</p>
<p>And indeed, we can accomplish this with logical induction. What we do is play chicken against <em>anything</em> which seems to predict our action beyond a certain tolerable degree. This gives us exactly the pseudorandom epsilon-exploration of LICDT/LIEDT. Unfortunately, there's a version of Agent Simulates Predictor which trips these up as well. Alas. (Asymptotic Decision Theory, on the other hand, gets Agent Simulates Predictor right; but, it is bad for other reasons.)</p>
<p>It's interesting that in proof-based decision theory, you never have to take the action; you just threaten to take it. (Or rather: you only take it if your logic is inconsistent.) It's like being able to learn from an experiment which you never perform, merely by virtue of putting yourself in a position where you <em>almost</em> do it.</p>
<h2>Troll Bridge</h2>
<p>Condition (3) is a sort of ""no Troll Bridge""condition. The write-ups of the <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=369"">Troll Bridge</a> on this forum are somewhat inadequate references to make my point well (they don't even call it Troll Bridge!), but the basic idea is that you put something in the environment which depends on the consistency of PA, in a way which makes a MUDT agent do the wrong thing via a very curious Löbian argument. There's a version of Troll Bridge which works on the self-referential exploration sentences <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""S_n""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base"" style=""margin-right: -0.032em;""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.032em;"">S</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mi"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">n</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> rather than the consistency of PA. It seems like what's going on in troll bridge has a lot to do with part of the environment correlating itself with your internal machinery; specifically, the internal machinery which ensures that you can have counterfactuals.</p>
<p>Troll Bridge is a counterexample to the idea of proof-length counterfactuals. The hypothesis behind proof-length counterfactuals is that A is a legitimate counterfactual consequence of B if a proof of A from B is much shorter than a proof of ¬A from B. It's interesting that my condition (3) rules it out like this; it suggests a possible relationship between what I'm doing and proof-length counterfactuals. But I suspected such a relationship since before writing SLSIII. The connection is this:</p>
<p>Proof-length counterfactuals are consistent with MUDT, and with variants of MUDT based on bounded-time proof search, because what the chicken rule does is put proofs of what the agent does juuust out of reach of the agent itself. If the environment is tractable enough that there exist proofs of the consequences of actions which the agent will be able to find, the chicken rule pushes the proofs of the agent's own actions far enough out that they won't interfere with that. As a result, you have to essentially step through the whole execution of the agent's code in order to prove what it does, which of course the agent can't do itself while it's running. We can refine proof-length counterfactuals to make an even tighter fit: given a proof search, A is a legitimate counterfactual consequence of B if the search finds a proof of A from B before it finds one for ¬A.</p>
<p>This makes it clear that the notion of counterfactual is <em>quite</em> subjective. Logical inductors actually make it significantly less so, because an LI can play chicken against <em>all</em> proof systems; it will be more effective in the short-run at playing chicken against its own proof system, but in the song run it learns to predict theorems as fast as any proof system would, so it can play chicken against them all. Nonetheless, LIDT still plays chicken against a subjective notion of predictability.</p>
<p>And this is obviously connected to my assumption (3). LIDT tries valiantly to make (3) true by decorrelating its actions with anything which can predict them. Sadly, as for Agent Simulates Predictor, we can construct a variant of Troll Bridge which causes this to fail anyway.</p>
<p>In any case, this view of what exploration-based counterfactuals are makes me regard them as significantly more natural than I think others do. Nonetheless, the fact remains that neither LIDT nor MUDT do all the things we'd like them to. They don't do what we would like in multi-agent situations. They don't solve Agent Simulates Predictor or Troll Bridge. It seems to me that when they fail, they fail for largely the same reasons, thanks to the strong analogy between their notions of counterfactual.</p>
<p>(There are some disanalogies, however; for one, logical inductor decision theories have a problem of selecting equilibria which doesn't seem to exist in proof-based decision theories.)</p>

Not too novel, yet a few useful points at the end. Rehashes some ideas from A Human&#x27;s Guide to Words.</p><p>I think that it is useful to model people as having filters that exist somewhere in their decision making process, filters which ask the question, “Does what I’m about to do match a behaviour trope that I’ve blacklisted?”</p><p>If the answer is yes, then the potential action gets vetoed and the brain goes back to the drawing board. If the answer is no, then the potential action gets bumped further up the decision making chain.</p><p>The effect of some filters are more visible than others. What many people would call one’s “social filter” is something that normally only vetoes doing or saying something after the potential action has already been brought to your conscious attention. You think about the accurate remark you could make about your colleague&#x27;s outfit, but then don’t say it because your filter deemed it rude.</p><p>Ugh fields look a lot like filters that get stronger and stronger with time and operate in the no-man&#x27;s-land between your opaque subconscious processes and your visible conscious ones.</p><p>If you want to be more specific about what it means to “match a trope”, we can replace trope with similarity cluster, and say that a potential action matches the trope if it is within a certain distance of the epicenter of the similarity cluster that a trope references.</p><p>For my personal use, I&#x27;ve called this sort of filtering Trope Dodging, but if another name seems better, I&#x27;m happy to concede.</p><p>Here’s what this could look like in day to day life:</p><p>Sasha thinks that whining and complaining are just terrible ideas. She grew up with siblings that always complained and who never tried to make their lives better. This left a strong impression on Sasha, and now she has a filter that keeps her from doing things that are too similar to the trope of “being whiny”. She doesn’t even like to discuss with her classmates about the difficulty of the various university course they are enrolled in, because her filter registers that as too close to “being whiny”.</p><p></p><p></p><p>You, being a lovable well read rationalist, can probably guess how these sorts of filters are less than optimal. Even if if you have determined that it really is in your best interest to not do anything that would be a prototypical example of a blacklisted trope, reality is messy enough that you are always going to be filtering out actions that would actually be a great idea, but just happen to be within the scope of your filter.</p><p>Hmmmm, actually, if filters you to cut out big swathes of “definitely bad ideas”, might the time saved in reaching conclusions faster outweigh the loss of superior alternatives?</p><p>That’s a totally reasonable hypothesis. If you had a filter that only started to get the wrong answer at the very edges of it&#x27;s blacklisted trope. You get problems when you have filters that are grossly miscalibrated and filter out a non-trivial amount of useful options.</p><p>When you have filters with that broad of a scope, it’s easy to catch something which vaguely matches the aesthetic of a trope, while still being devoid of the “core essence” that caused you to define the trope in the first place. Discussing the difficulty of your classes sort of fits the general aura of “whining and complaining”, but lacks the essential traits of whininess, i.e. a sense of entitlement and a defeatist attitude. There’s nothing inherently wrong with making someone aware that you have wronged them, yet it sort of vaguely smells like “getting angry at people”. I know a lot of people who don’t take time for things like sleep, exercise, and nutrition, because they have such a broad filter against “wasting time”.</p><p>In all of these scenarios someone loses out on doing something that could genuinely help them, all because their filters are too broad.</p><p></p><p></p><p>***</p><p>So far, you might not be very impressed. Most of what I’ve said could be summed up with, “When people use generalizations to guide their actions, they will often make the wrong decision.” However, I think there are some specific claims I’m now able to make which would have been much harder to make clear without the build up.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Claim 1: By default, one’s filters are likely to be poorly calibrated, and the scope of a filter is proportional to how strongly you feel about the prototypical example of the filter’s trope:</p><p>Obviously, people are capable of nuanced views and well calibrated filters, but I think it would be an error to assume that any filters you haven’t given any particular attention to are going to be quality. The initial growth of a filter looks a lot like someone over-steering away from something they decided they didn’t like. If you really don’t like the trope you are trying to avoid, I think that your filter defaults to having an equally large scope.</p><p>Claim 2: A poorly calibrated filter does more damage the deeper into your decision making process it lives.</p><p>Basically, if a poorly calibrated filter is acting within you range of conscious awareness, then you have decent chance at realizing that something is going on. Being privy to the process of filtering makes it easy to question the quality of the filter.</p><p>When you have a filter that acts outside of your conscious awareness, it feels like you just never even think of the ideas that are being filtered. For me, it is very rare for the thought, “Hey, maybe I should ask someone for help” to come to mind, even when it objectively makes sense given the situation. I’ve learned to mostly follow through when someone brings up the idea of getting help, but it’s still something I’m subconsciously filtering against, and it’s hard for the idea to even come to mind.</p><p>***</p><p>So… given all that, how should one proceed? I don’t have any particular advice on how to calibrate a filter you’ve already identified as a problem. However, combining claim one and two gives some insight into how to seek out these filters. To find poorly calibrated filters that don’t operate inside your conscious awareness, focus on the things you feel most strongly about. What are things that are very similar to things that you hate, but that aren’t actually harmful, and what are things that are similar to things you really love, but that are actually harmful?</p><p>Prompt for discussion: Once one finds deeply rooted filters with poor calibration, how should you go about fixing them?</p><p></p><p></p><p></p></div></div></div></div>",Hazard,hazard,Hazard,

Now that the project’s reached a pretty good stopping point, I’m looking back to see how my expectations and goals played out.] </em></p><h2><strong>Initial Goals:</strong></h2><p><em>[What I originally wanted the book to be like. My estimates vs reality]</em></p><p>Originally, I wanted to write something that would tie together all the current research on topics like motivation, planning, and habits. I felt like lots of LessWrong posts touched upon certain areas, like hyperbolic discounting, but there wasn’t a central place where it all came together.</p><p>I wanted a new central beacon to point people to when The Sequences didn’t quite fit. </p><p>I’d envisioned a sequence of essays which would give an overview of the latest developments in the field followed by concrete techniques, ala CFAR. </p><p>Here are some of the topics I’d originally wanted to cover:</p><ol><li><p>Willpower</p></li><li><p>Attention</p></li><li><p>Habits</p></li><li><p>Behavioral Economics</p></li><li><p>Motivation</p></li></ol><p>When I began this project, I had Planning 101 under my belt, which had taken me about 20 hours to complete. As far as base rates went, it seemed reasonable to think that the other topics would take a similar amount of time.</p><p>Looking back, it feels a little silly to think that Past Owen thought he could take on five more of those 20+ hour chunk projects. That would have easily been 100+ hours, in addition to editing, compiling, and a bunch of additional grunt work which snuck up on me.</p><p>(What was I thinking?)</p><p>In the end, I only managed to write one more primer—Habits 101—which ended up taking about twice as long, 40 hours, for just the actual writing portion. Reading up on the articles took up additional time, probably another 10 hours or more.</p><p>Though I didn’t complete my initial vision, I actually did fairly well on my own estimates:</p><p>I’d given myself an internal completion date of the beginning of September, and I actually finished around that time. (Hooray!)</p><p>I’d also estimated that I’d write about 10,000 words of new content for the book. And I went about 50% more than that, writing about 15,000 words of actual new content. (Hooray!)</p><p>(Although the counterfactual for the new content prediction isn’t as good as it seems because I probably would have written some of those blog posts regardless of whether or not I also held the intention to make a sequence.)</p><h2><strong>The Finished Result:</strong></h2><p><em>[Evaluating the end product, some things which didn&#x27;t make the final cut.]</em></p><p>So I ended up both finishing both on-target and on-time. How did the actual end product compare with my expectations?</p><p>Well, I’ve already pointed out how there was a lot of content I wanted to write which didn’t make it into the book. As for the content that did, here are the 9 sections that made it into the book:</p><ol><li><p>Introduction</p></li><li><p>WTF Is Rationality?</p></li><li><p>Starting Advice</p></li><li><p>Planning 101</p></li><li><p>Interlude 1</p></li><li><p>Habits 101</p></li><li><p>Interlude 2</p></li><li><p>Attractor Theory</p></li><li><p>Closing Disclaimer</p></li></ol><p>Of the 9 sections, I think that WTF Is Rationality?, Starting Advice, and Attractor Theory come closest to the sort of “crystallization” I’d originally hoped for. </p><p>In the time between the original blog posts and the polished book essays, I’d had time to try explaining them to people in person. I think the experience helped me understand which things were important to focus on and what background knowledge I needed to assume. The revision and slow iteration of ideas helped me figure out which components were the important ones to stress.</p><p>So I think those three sections turned out the best.</p><p>As for the two 101 primers, I think they were too bulky, and I think a better choice would have been to sacrifice depth for breadth. That is to say, cutting the length of Habits 101 in half (or even two-thirds) in order to make way for a short primer on both Attention and Behavioral Economics would have likely been good.</p><p>Otherwise, I think it feels a bit jarring to switch from a short heuristic-y essays about ways to approach life to a deep academic dive into psychology.</p><p>As the sequence currently stands, I think it’s unbalanced in terms of the topics it goes over. Partially due to the length of the two 101 primers, I think there’s an overemphasis on planning and habits.</p><p>Overall, I think it pushes the “master yourself” mindset over the “become one with yourself” mindset too hard, which I ended up writing about in the Closing Disclaimer.</p><p>Perhaps unfortunately, I’m also fairly confident that most people who read it won’t get much benefit out of it. (More on this in Evaluating Impact.)</p><p>Starting out, I also had some big hopes for the actual format of the book.</p><p>I think that most writing doesn’t do a good job of helping the reader chunk the information. That is to say, the information trying to be conveyed is often much clearer in the author’s mind than in the readers’. I claim this is often because the author has their own way of mentally structuring the information which they neglect to share during the actual writing.</p><p>Frustrated with this, I’d originally wanted to include several design features for the sequence to help with understanding:</p><ul><li><p>Suggested Exercises at the end of every chapter, focused on developing practical skills.</p></li><li><p>Unique formatting, perhaps a different font color, for paragraphs which contained examples (to visually differentiate them from the rest of the text).</p></li><li><p>Visual outlines of how points connected in each essay. (You can see some simple prototype attempts in Habits 101.)</p></li></ul><p>In the end, the only one that made it to the final book are the bracketed summaries in italics that precede each section.</p><p>I think that conveying ideas in general is actually rather quite difficult. Cooperation is required on both the part of the author and the reader, and even an engaging writing style (or cool design tricks) can only do so much.</p><h2><strong>Writing Time:</strong></h2><p><em>[Reflections on the actual writing process.]</em></p><p>I ended up having less time to write the entire book than I originally thought. </p><p>No surprise there. </p><p>(“You don’t plan for disaster. Disaster plans for you.”)</p><p>Part of the reason was because I was physically unavailable on account of my being at Google doing CS things for three weeks.</p><p>The other part was that I found myself mentally incapable of writing quality content for long bouts of time.</p><p>The roughly 100 hours I put into writing this book was scattered over about 4 months. That ends up being less than an hour a day, though the distribution of hours wasn’t uniform. When it came to writing this book, I found that certain times yielded far more productivity than others. </p><p>Also, looking back, it feels like the entire duration of time was necessary, even if most of it wasn’t actually spent writing. It feels like I just needed time in between writing sessions to let my mind do its thing under the hood, subconsciously. I’d write for about an hour, wander about the room (or do something else for an hour), and then I’d return to writing.</p><p>This seems like a specific instance of the general principle that breaks aren’t just a “fun” activity, but are actually a requisite for good work to happen.</p><p>So it was less about getting enough free time in a chunk, but more about getting enough of the right kinds of time, or something like that. For context, I think that one thing people overlook when considering making tradeoffs involving time is the nature of the time they’re gaining or losing.</p><p>For example, if you’re able to save ten minutes off your commute, that roughly translates to having ten additional minutes to spend at work, which might not be worth much. In contrast, if you’re able to extend your lunch break by twenty minutes, that could be enough time for a noontime nap, which might be very valuable.</p><h2><strong>Against the Incentive Gradient</strong></h2><p><em>[Writing longform has certain drawbacks.]</em></p><p>When I was working on this project, a friend pushed me to consider writing for a larger group like BuzzFeed or ClearerThinking. They argued that even though the type of content engagement I’d get from readers would be less, the net increase in audience size would mean that the aggregate impact would overall be larger.</p><p>The argument seemed good, but I ended up sticking to my original plan to write in longform.</p><p>(Longer exploration on this topic in <a href=""https://www.lesserwrong.com/posts/HRy2sFtXBjLbxQnqu/the-best-self-help-should-be-self-defeating"">The Best Self-Help Should Be Self-Defeating</a>.)</p><h2><strong>Final Lessons:</strong></h2><p><em>[What were my concrete takeaways?]</em></p><p>There were several things I learned as a result of undertaking this project:</p><ol><li><p>My internal estimates for my task completion time and writing rate are fairly well-calibrated.</p></li><li><p>I can make graphics of a quality I’m happy with at a rate of about 1 graphic an hour.</p></li><li><p>Experience and understanding of what research looks like. (EX: Filtering through papers to find promising things, writing summaries, simplifying at the right level, etc.)</p></li><li><p>Getting constant feedback is both important for my ability to continue projects, as well as improve the quality. I didn’t get enough of it this time around.</p></li><li><p>I had, overall, still underestimated the difficulty involved in writing and editing a book-style project.</p></li></ol><p>The biggest one, though, was the burning question I had when setting out on this project: <em>“Why the hell hasn’t anyone tried to make this type of freely available rationality handbook before?”</em></p><p>The answer, I think, looks something like this:</p><p>If you’re writing self-help content, the question of who the audience is inevitable. After all, at some point, someone’s supposed to be reading the content. And in my current understanding of people, it seems like there’s roughly two categories of readers (gross oversimplification alert!):</p><p>One, if you’re already smart and self-sufficient, then you’re already combing all the coolest blogs and books for insight. You’re a hyper-scholar who has either read and gotten value out of what I have to offer, or you’ve already got even more sophisticated models.</p><p>Two, if you’re the sort of insight junkie who’s looking for the next 5 minute article on how to restructure your workflow, then you may miss out on the actual good stuff. If you’re always only looking at the small insights, then the ontological lens of rationality (which is what I really want to illustrate), is largely lost.</p><p>So I guess one strong reason for why the sort of rationality handbook I was envisioning hasn’t happened is because it doesn’t really help out either of the groups.</p><p>The target audience is someone who’s a little mixed up in their stages of intellectual development.</p><p>I’m reminded of how I felt after talking about the book <em>Gödel, Escher, Bach</em> with some friends studying computer science. It’s a book which I very much enjoyed. However, none of them had been impressed with it, and they found it largely pedantic, taking too long to get to some basic insights.</p><p>Most people who read <em>GEB</em>, I suspect, either get lost in the dizzying array of cultural references and come out with a messy interpretation, or are already with maths and computer science such that the key points fall flat.</p><p>When I read it, I was in this weird spot where I didn’t know any computer science, but I also looked past the references, and I found something exciting that encouraged me to dive deeper. </p><p style=""text-align:center;"">++++</p><p>With this instrumental rationality sequence, I’d wanted to write something for other people to benefit from. In a funny sort of way, though, I guess I really did just end up writing a book for myself.</p></div></div></div></div>",,,,

Your feelings are also important! Pay attention to them.]</em></p><p>After reading through this sequence, you might be feeling very excited to go out and try some of this stuff out. You might think about imposing this instrumental rationality stuff upon many areas of your life.</p><p>And for that, I have a major cautionary warning.</p><p>Rationality can be dangerous because it&#x27;s an ontology. And while it&#x27;s not the One Ontology to Rule Them All, it can often <em>feel</em> like that when you&#x27;re within the rationality framing. </p><p>Here’s an analogy:</p><p>Owen is a person who wants to get work done, but often finds himself playing video games. He also feels bad about doing so because it doesn’t fit in with his self-image. Maybe there’s also something here about society has shaped his values, but the actual root cause isn’t that important. The main point is that some part of him likes playing the games.</p><p>So he’s following his intuitive feelings, but also there’s guilt somewhere in the system. </p><p>Now let’s say he bumps into instrumental rationality—planning, habits, motivation—the whole package. </p><p>What I&#x27;ve presented in this sequence is a way of looking at things, kind of like a set of special glasses. </p><p>Once Owen puts on these glasses, he starts to see new opportunities to use his shiny new techniques, like TAPs, to try and remove his video-game-playing habit. But note that the very idea of techniques, of transforming concepts into concrete actionables, is only something he sees when he puts on his Rationality Glasses. </p><p>My worry is when people use rationality as the lens through which they view the world for so long that they forget that there’s something important that’s hidden underneath the Rationality Glasses layer. Owen might just end up thinking that the Rationality Glasses show how the world is, rather than merely a useful way of looking at the world.</p><p>And instrumental rationality, or at least the way that I’ve presented it here, will have its own ideological biases. This isn’t necessarily bad; it’s a necessary consequence of any way of looking at the world. There’ll always be implicit values for any system you choose to use.</p><p>For rationality, these values are about highly striving for things like Optimization and Self-Improvement. I worry that this implicit valuation can be taken in a very wrong way. I see a failure mode where everything that doesn’t directly contribute to Optimization is seen as a “bad” thing which needs to be removed.</p><p>Owen might then see his video-game-habit as something foreign and “bad” rather than a poorly understood part of himself. So when Owen tries to use rationality to forcibly remove those “disobedient” parts of system, I think something quite terrible is very happening because he’s smothering vital parts of himself.</p><p>Just because those parts of yourself conflict with your “stated” values doesn’t mean they’re wrong. It’s important to recognize that many apparently “bad” parts of yourself also have good intentions.</p><p>After all, these were parts of himself that Owen had listened to prior to encountering rationality. They might be hidden under the current framing, but they’re still important.</p><p>It’s a little like if I just handed you an instruction manual for the human mind, but with a bunch of the pages missing.</p><p>There’s a lot that you’d now know about how things in the mind work, but if you just follow those directions, you wouldn’t get the whole story. There will be functions and knobs that’ll also be important which you wouldn’t know about. If you only follow the manual and don’t trust your own sense of what else is critical, then you’re in trouble. </p><p>Sooner or later, something will break, and troubleshooting will be very, very difficult.</p><p>This is why I think it’s important to respect those “useless” (from the Rationality Glasses POV) parts of yourself. Just because you can&#x27;t see a part&#x27;s function doesn&#x27;t imply there isn&#x27;t one.</p><p>The best solution, as far as I can tell, is something like being able to take off the Rationality Glasses to get in touch with those gut, instinctual, and quiet parts of yourself. You need to be able to step away from the rationality virtues of Optimization and just accept all the parts of yourself.</p><p>When you stop trying to cut off or suppress different parts of yourself, something very different happens.</p><p>You get a shift where you…Just Do Things. </p><p>Motivation and willpower, for example, end up just seeming like largely incoherent words. You’ll have different tastes, but suddenly the question of “How can I force myself to do/not-do X?” just becomes irrelevant.</p><p>When you start integrating those quiet parts of yourself, you’re somehow more in-control, even thought you’re incorporating more dissent. I know it sounds sily on the surface. But there’s something very good that’s happening here, I think, when you allow all parts of yourself to be fulfilled.</p><p>This, of course, is a critique of instrumental rationality as I&#x27;ve presented it throughout this sequence. Others have taken the field farther.</p><p>A more sophisticated theory of instrumental rationality, like some of CFAR&#x27;s curriculum, might be more about communication, focusing on ways to integrate and dialogue between the explicit parts of yourself (which the Rationality Glasses endorse) and the implicit parts of yourself (which might not be endorsed, but are important nonetheless).</p><p style=""text-align:center;"">++++</p><p>So, as you venture forth to try out things, just remember that the set of glasses you&#x27;ve got is incomplete.</p><p>And sometimes, you can see even more clearly without them.</p></div></div></div></div>",,,,
shnSyzv4Jq3bhMNw5,AlphaGo Zero and the Foom Debate,alphago-zero-and-the-foom-debate,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/shnSyzv4Jq3bhMNw5/alphago-zero-and-the-foom-debate,2017-10-21T02:18:50.130Z,98,53,17,False,False,,"<html><head></head><body><p>AlphaGo Zero uses 4 TPUs, is built entirely out of neural nets with no handcrafted features, doesn't pretrain against expert games or anything else human, reaches a superhuman level after 3 days of self-play, and is the strongest version of AlphaGo yet.</p><p>The architecture has been simplified. Previous AlphaGo had a policy net that predicted good plays, and a value net that evaluated positions, both feeding into lookahead using MCTS (random probability-weighted plays out to the end of a game). AlphaGo Zero has one neural net that selects moves and this net is trained by <a href=""https://ai-alignment.com/alphago-zero-and-capability-amplification-ede767bb8446"">Paul Christiano-style capability amplification</a>, playing out games against itself to learn new probabilities for winning moves.</p><p>As others have also remarked, this seems to me to be an element of evidence that favors the Yudkowskian position over the Hansonian position in my and Robin Hanson's <a href=""https://intelligence.org/ai-foom-debate/"">AI-foom debate</a>.</p><p>As I recall and as I understood:</p><ul><li>Hanson doubted that what he calls ""architecture"" is much of a big deal, compared to (Hanson said) elements like cumulative domain knowledge, or special-purpose components built by specialized companies in what he expects to be an ecology of companies serving an AI economy.</li><li>When I remarked upon how it sure looked to me like humans had an architectural improvement over chimpanzees that counted for a lot, Hanson replied that this seemed to him like a one-time gain from allowing the cultural accumulation of knowledge.</li></ul><p>I emphasize how all the mighty human edifice of Go knowledge, the joseki and tactics developed over centuries of play, the experts teaching children from an early age, was entirely discarded by AlphaGo Zero with a subsequent performance improvement. These mighty edifices of human knowledge, as I understand the Hansonian thesis, are supposed to be <i>the</i> bulwark against rapid gains in AI capability across multiple domains at once. I was like ""Human intelligence is crap and our accumulated skills are crap"" and this appears to have been bourne out.</p><p>Similarly, single research labs like Deepmind are not supposed to pull far ahead of the general ecology, because adapting AI to any particular domain is supposed to require lots of components developed all over the place by a market ecology that makes those components available to other companies. AlphaGo Zero is much simpler than that. To the extent that nobody else can run out and build AlphaGo Zero, it's either because Google has Tensor Processing Units that aren't generally available, or because Deepmind has a silo of expertise for being able to actually make use of existing ideas like ResNets, or both.</p><p>Sheer speed of capability gain should also be highlighted here. Most of my argument for FOOM in the Y-H debate was about self-improvement and what happens when an optimization loop is folded in on itself. Though it wasn't necessary to my argument, the fact that Go play went from ""nobody has come close to winning against a professional"" to ""so strongly superhuman they're not really bothering any more"" over two years just because that's what happens when you improve and simplify the architecture, says <i>you don't even need self-improvement</i> to get things that look like FOOM.</p><p>Yes, Go is a closed system allowing for self-play. It still took humans centuries to learn how to play it. Perhaps the new Hansonian bulwark against rapid capability gain can be that the environment has lots of empirical bits that are supposed to be very hard to learn, <i>even in the limit of AI thoughts fast enough to blow past centuries of human-style learning in 3 days</i>; and that humans have learned these vital bits over centuries of cultural accumulation of knowledge, <i>even though we know that humans take centuries to do 3 days of AI learning when humans have all the empirical bits they need</i>; and that AIs cannot absorb this knowledge very quickly using ""architecture"", <i>even though humans learn it from each other using architecture</i>. If so, then let's write down this new world-wrecking assumption (that is, the world ends if the assumption is false) and be on the lookout for further evidence that this assumption might perhaps be wrong.</p><p>Tl;dr: As others are already remarking, the situation with AlphaGo Zero looks nothing like the Hansonian hypothesis and a heck of a lot more like the Yudkowskian one.</p><p>Added: AlphaGo clearly isn't a general AI. There's obviously stuff humans do that make us much more general than AlphaGo, and AlphaGo obviously doesn't do that. However, if even with the human special sauce we're to expect AGI capabilities to be slow, domain-specific, and requiring feed-in from a big market ecology, then the situation we see without human-equivalent generality special sauce should not look like this.</p><p>To put it another way, I put a lot of emphasis in my debate on recursive self-improvement and the remarkable jump in generality across the change from primate intelligence to human intelligence. It doesn't mean we can't get info about speed of capability gains <i>without</i> self-improvement. It doesn't mean we can't get info about the importance and generality of algorithms <i>without </i>the general intelligence trick. The debate can start to settle for fast capability gains before we even get to what I saw as the good parts; I wouldn't have predicted AlphaGo and lost money betting against the speed of its capability gains, because reality held a more extreme position than I did on the Yudkowsky-Hanson spectrum.</p><hr><p>Crossposted <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/yudkowsky/posts/10155848910529228?pnref=story"">here</a>.</p></body></html>",Eliezer_Yudkowsky,eliezer_yudkowsky,Eliezer Yudkowsky,

</style></head><body><p><em>A putative new idea for AI control; index <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=601"">here</a></em>.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19N4kjYbZD4"">Previously</a>, I presented a model in which a “rationality module” kept track of two things: how well a human was maximising their actual reward, and whether their preferences had been overridden by AI action.</p>
<p>The second didn’t integrate well into the first, and was tracked by a clunky extra Boolean. Since the two didn’t fit together, I was going to separate the two concepts, especially since the Boolean felt a bit too... Boolean, not allowing for grading. But then I realised that they actually fit together completely naturally, without the need for arbitrary Booleans or other tricks.</p>

<h1>Feast or heroin famine</h1>
<p>Consider the situation detailed in the following figure.

<p>There’s also the issue that humans are poorly rational to start off with, so we have large regret for AIs that don’t do anything; but this makes sense.

It&#x27;s trying to find paths to get to pleasure and avoid pain. Of course, this often requires solving abstract problems, as well. Watching myself, and others, identify and solve problems suggests the existence of underlying patterns. There seem to be recurring strategies. Some simple and some compound. Some that an individual may use almost every time and others that rarely come up. There are strategies that seem obvious to one person and remain unheard of to others. Sometimes we deploy these strategies consciously but often they seem to run unconsciously.</p><p>I call these strategies <em>Thinking Toys</em>. Little tricks we can pick up, play with for a moment, and then throw aside as we move on. Using a toy more often seems to make it more accessible. We also learn more of its nuances -- we improve at using it. I&#x27;m trying to explicate as many of these as I can. Eventually, I want to categorize them and try to understand how they relate to each other.</p><p>See if any of these are interesting to you. Some will be familiar and obvious, whereas others may feel strange and alien.

No, usually it’s just bending and stretching. So if that can’t change how curved it is, why can the toppings fall off your pizza?</p><p>The answer is that Gaussian curvature, the ‘correct’ kind of curvature in the sense that it’s the kind that is topologically constant over the surface of the manifold, is basically the “curvature in both directions,” when looking at a surface.</p><p>When a pizza is flat, you can choose any direction, and it’s not curved, so 0. Then you choose the orthogonal direction, and it’s still not curved, so that’s 0 too. Then multiply those to get Gaussian curvature, and you get 0.</p><p>Conveniently, if you multiply ANYTHING by zero, you get zero. So all you need for your pizza to work out is, basically, one direction where the pizza isn’t curved, and it can curve as much as it wants in the other direction and still be “flat” since the curvature is being multiplied by zero.</p><p>But you can exploit this! If you pick a direction and purposefully curve your pizza in that direction, then in order to be “flat” in the Gaussian curvature sense, the pizza will be pushed to stay up in the other direction (unless it tears, which is always a possibility)</p><p>This is very convenient if you want to keep all that cheese on your pizza!</p><p>But if you’re a hyperintelligent n-dimensional shade of the color blue, this won’t help you.</p><p>Imagine you’re trying to eat a slice of three dimensional pizza, and you fold it in one direction to give one of it’s Laplacian eigenvalues a very high value. Then a second Laplacian eigenvalue will have to be zero, to cancel this out and maintain the zero Gaussian curvature of your hyperpizza. But this three dimensional hyperpizza has a third Laplacian eigenvalue! So while you hold your hyperpizza up by the crust in one dimension, and that pulls it up in a second dimension, all the toppings fall off in the third direction.</p><p>This brings us to the reason I’m talking about Gaussian curvature today.</p><p>In the ancestral environment, machine learning engineers cared a lot about avoiding local optima in their problems.</p></div></div></div></div><div class=""ory-row ory-cell-inner""><div class=""ory-cell ory-cell-sm-12 ory-cell-xs-12""><div class=""ory-cell-inner ory-cell-leaf""><div><img class=""ory-plugins-content-image"" src=""https://peachturnspro.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/1.png""/></div></div></div></div><div class=""ory-row ory-cell-inner""><div class=""ory-cell ory-cell-sm-12 ory-cell-xs-12""><div class=""ory-cell-inner ory-cell-leaf""><div><p>These local optima are places where the local derivatives are all zero, and even if you move a little bit nearby, you’ll end up rolling right back to them. Think about climbing to the highest peak; if you’re right next to a lower peak you’ll probably climb up that one instead of trying to find a different peak (at least if you’re an ML algorithm executing gradient descent).</p><p>One of the things that makes local optima so worrying is that, in some situations, you may have to go a long way to get to a different local optimum, and you’ll still be uncertain about whether you’re at the best one!</p><p>Those of you who remember your first calculus classes may recall that there are two ways for a local flat area to arise: at a peak or at a valley (or an inflection point but these should be extremely rare). If you’re trying to find the lowest place on the map, then a peak isn’t going to give you too much of a problem—you’ll move a little bit away and start rolling down the hill. There are plenty of ways to implement this in ML; things like random minor perturbation of your weights or data augmentation with noise or just normal tricks like Adam optimization.</p><p>This is where the pizza metaphor comes back. In the ancestral environment, machine learning engineers worked with things like pizza or three dimension hyperpizza. And they were really trying to get those toppings to fall off. But if there was one hand holding up a part of the pizza, then they couldn’t get moving, and if there was a second hand holding up the hyperpizza they were also stuck.</p><p>But as we’ve progressed in time and computational power and data size, we end up mostly working in very high dimensional spaces these days. A typical deep neural net can have tens of thousands of parameters, so our gradient descent is happening in a ten thousand dimensional space!</p><p>Now, there are a lot of steps that occur in training a neural network, and I don’t want to assume anything about the problem like the idea that peaks and valleys in different directions are independently likely. But if they are, and if the odds are 50/50 in any direction that you&#x27;ll find a peak versus a valley, then to have a 10% chance of encountering a true local optimum you&#x27;ll need to encounter N critical points, where N satisfies:</p><p>[1 - (.5^10000)]^N = .1</p><p>N log(1 - (.5^10000)) = log(.1)</p><p>N = log(.1)/log(1-.5^10000)</p><p>.5^1000 is about 10^-302, so .5^10000 is about 10^-3000, which google calculator refuses to keep in memory for me, but it looks like log(.1)/log(.999...) is about 2.3*10^(number of nines) so we can just flip that and say you&#x27;d need to encounter 10^3000 critical points before expecting one to be a local optimum (IF your features are independent--they usually aren&#x27;t but that&#x27;s a different problem).</p><p>In conclusion, getting stuck in local optima isn’t really a problem for deep learning. Local optima are just so hard to come by, that you don’t really expect to see them at all.</p><h3>Coda</h3><p>So personally I don’t think that convex optimization is a very interesting part of deep learning. It’s something that’s been studied extensively and implemented in low level C code and everyone has built specialized hardware for doing all the linear algebra, and I don’t feel like it’s under-studied or like it’s going to lead to any exciting breakthroughs. I’m glad people are working on it, but I don’t care that much about thinking about it myself. But I do like the Gauss-Bonnet pizza story and optimization is what’s been happening in the Coursera course and I want to write every day so here you go.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>",magfrump,magfrump,magfrump,

This year’s theme is “Generations” - the passing down of culture and knowledge from teacher to student, from master to apprentice, from parent to child. The stories we tell will investigate the methods by which this knowledge has been preserved, and how we can continue to do so for future generations.</p><h2>Sounds great.

Our long-term path to sustainability at a lower price point involves getting more yearly attendance, so we want to continue to provide discounted access for the general public and people with tight finances.

What is Secular Solstice?</h2><p>Secular Solstice is a rationalist tradition, and one of the few public facing rationalist held events. It’s what it says on the tin: a nonreligious winter solstice holiday. We sing, we tell stories about scientific progress and humanist values, we light candles. Usually, we get about 150 people in NYC.

What’s this sleepover thing?</h2><p>Since we’ll have a whole bunch of people from the rationalist community all in town for the same weekend, it’d be awesome if we could spend that weekend hanging out together, learning from each other and doing ingroup things. Because many of us will need a place to stay anyway, we can rent a big house on Airbnb together and use that as the central gathering place, like at Highgarden in 2014. This way we’ll have more flexibility to do things than if we all have to wander around looking for a public space.</p><p>Besides Solstice and the afterparty, the big activity will be an unconference on Saturday afternoon.

There&#x27;ll also be plenty of room for unstructured socializing, of course.</p><p>This is all going to cost up to $100 per person for the Airbnb rental, plus $25 per person for food (including at least Saturday lunch and dinner and Sunday breakfast) and other expenses. (The exact Airbnb location hasn’t been determined determined yet, because we don’t know how many participants there’ll be, but $100 per person will be the upper limit on price.)</p><p>To gauge interest, registration is open from now until October 30. You’ll be asked to authorize a PayPal payment of $125. It works like Kickstarter; you won’t be charged until October 30, and only if there’s enough interest to move forward. You’ll also only be charged your share of what the rental actually ends up costing, plus the additional $25. For this, you’ll get to sleep in the Airbnb house Friday through Sunday nights (or whatever subset of those you can make it), have three meals with us, and hang out with a bunch of nice/cool/awesome ingroup people throughout the weekend.

Words like cooperation, loyalty, diligence, and empathy were written down. As the list grew longer, I realized they all fit one or two of three categories: relational, emotional, and action. These are the three states that Hufflepuffs are most valued for. Loyalty is a relational state, while diligence is an action state. Meanwhile, cooperation is a blend of action and relational, and empathy is a blend of emotional and relational.</p><p></p><p>The fourth state (cognitive) is more or less what the community was founded on, so it makes sense that the other three are where the community is lacking. People and communities often pick a state to prioritize, letting others fall by the wayside. My experience with other communities show that the cognitive state is often deprioritized, which is why it makes sense that there would be demand for a community that bases itself in such a state. A person coming from a socio-emotionally heavy subculture may find rationality refreshing in its focus on truth-seeking as opposed to what &quot;feels good&quot;, and an imbalance in other communities may cause rationalists to lean too heavily on the cognitive, ignoring other states altogether.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of whether or not you consider yourself a rationalist, there is probably a state where you see yourself or your community lacking. As with many theories in personality psychology, there is an implication here that balance is best. I don&#x27;t want to assume that this is true in all cases, but running a few mental experiments could shed light on the tradeoffs. If a cognitive-heavy community focused on  action a little more, what would that look like? If a friend who spends a lot of time in the relational state started setting aside time for emotional processing, what would they lose and gain? On a community-wide level, balance between the states makes the community more open to different kinds of people. A cognitive community with more relational focus would feel more welcoming, and more focus on the emotional state might help it feel more comfortable and safe. But for those who want the kind of community with a high barrier to entry, this may not be particularly wanted. Instead, they may prefer focusing on the cognitive even more, ensuring that the community is full of people with the same interests and values as them. That is not to say that this is a bad thing! Personality psychology claims balance between traits and kinds of traits is better because personality psychology tries to prioritize diversity and see it as a value. Of course, not everyone agrees with this, even in the field of psychology. This is why, though Jung thought it should be a person&#x27;s goal to achieve balance between traits like Introversion and Extroversion or Thinking and Feeling, Myers-Briggs types (which use the same traits Jung spoke of) have been sold to the public as a way of being proud of your personality type, not as something that should or would change.</p><p></p><p>(This is also partly due to Humanistic Psychology&#x27;s idea that personality is static over a lifetime and the outside world interferes with finding your &quot;true self&quot;, but that&#x27;s a whole other blog post.)</p><p></p><p>This blog is probably going to focus quite a bit on emotional and relational states, with some focus on action and cognitive states as well. This is less because of how I feel the world should be and more because of my own skill set and personality, especially in relation to the community and other blogs. Of the four, I think I am weakest in the action state, so while I&#x27;ll try to mention new discoveries I make here in my attempts to strengthen this side of me, the topic won&#x27;t be nearly as well explored as the other three states, especially in relation to each other. I&#x27;ve been tagging posts with whichever state they are meant to explore, so hopefully this will be a useful heuristic moving forward.</p></div></div></div></div>",squidious,squidious,squidious,

We are plagued by highly visible people ranging from Musk to Ng painting pictures ranging from imminent risk to highly premature needless fear, but that doesn&#x27;t depict the center of gravity, which has noticeably shifted to thinking about the potential bad outcomes and what we might do about it. (Turning close to home to provide an example of how mainstream this is becoming, at Cornell two AI professors, Joe Halpern and Bart Selman, ran a seminar and course last semester on societal and ethical challenges for AI, and only just a few weeks ago we had a labor economist speak in our CS colloquium series about policy ideas targeting possible future directions for CS and AI, to an extremely large and enthusiastic audience.)</p></blockquote><p>To which Eliezer Yudkowsky replied:</p><blockquote><p>My forecast of the net effects of &quot;ethical&quot; discussion is negative; I expect it to be a cheap, easy, attention-grabbing distraction from technical issues and technical thoughts that actually determine okay outcomes. [...]</p><p>The ethics of bridge-building is to not have your bridge fall down and kill people and there is a frame of mind in which this obviousness is obvious enough. <em>How</em> not to have the bridge fall down is hard.</p></blockquote><p>This is possibly surprising coming from the person who came up with <a href=""https://arbital.com/p/cev/"">coherent extrapolated volition</a>, co-wrote the <em>Cambridge Handbook of Artificial Intelligence </em>article on &quot;<a href=""https://intelligence.org/files/EthicsofAI.pdf"">The Ethics of AI</a>,&quot; etc. The relevant background comes from Eliezer&#x27;s writing on the <a href=""https://arbital.com/p/minimality_principle/"">minimality principle</a>:</p><blockquote><p>[W]hen we are building the <em>first</em> <a href=""https://arbital.com/p/sufficiently_advanced_ai/"">sufficiently advanced Artificial Intelligence</a>, we are operating in an extremely dangerous context in which building a marginally more powerful AI is marginally more dangerous. The first AGI ever built should therefore execute the least dangerous plan for <a href=""https://arbital.com/p/pivotal/"">preventing immediately following AGIs from destroying the world six months later</a>. Furthermore, the least dangerous plan is not the plan that seems to contain the fewest material actions that seem risky in a conventional sense, but rather the plan that requires the <em>least dangerous cognition</em> from the AGI executing it. Similarly, inside the AGI itself, if a class of thought seems dangerous but necessary to execute sometimes, we want to execute the least instances of that class of thought required to accomplish the overall task.</p><p>E.g., if we think it&#x27;s a dangerous kind of event for the AGI to ask &quot;How can I achieve this end using strategies from across every possible domain?&quot; then we might want a design where most routine operations only search for strategies within a particular domain, and events where the AI searches across all known domains are rarer and visible to the programmers. Processing a goal that can recruit subgoals across every domain would be a dangerous event, albeit a necessary one, and therefore we want to do <em>less</em> of it within the AI.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>So the technical task of figuring out how to build a robust minimal AGI system that&#x27;s well-aligned with its operators&#x27; intentions is very different from &quot;AI ethics&quot;; and the tendency to conflate those two has plausibly caused a lot of thought and attention to go into much broader (or much narrower) issues that could have more profitably gone into thinking about the alignment problem.</p><p>One part of doing the absolute bare <a href=""http://www.danieldewey.net/fast-takeoff-strategies.html"">world-saving minimum</a> with a general-purpose reasoning system is steering clear of any strategies that require the system to do significant moral reasoning (or implement less-than-totally-airtight moral views held by its operators). Just execute the most simple and straightforward concrete sequence of actions, requiring the least dangerous varieties and quantity of AGI cognition needed for success.</p><p>Another way of putting this view is that nearly all of the effort should be going into solving the technical problem, &quot;How would you get an AI system to do some very modest <a href=""https://arbital.com/p/task_goal/"">concrete action</a> requiring extremely high levels of intelligence,  such as building two strawberries that are completely identical at the cellular level, without causing anything weird or disruptive to happen?&quot;</p><p>Where obviously it&#x27;s important that the system not do anything severely unethical in the process of building its strawberries; but if your strawberry-building system requires its developers to have a full understanding of meta-ethics or value aggregation in order to be safe and effective, then you&#x27;ve made some kind of catastrophic design mistake and should start over with a different approach.</p></div></div></div></div>",RobbBB,robbbb,Rob Bensinger,

But a few weeks ago I was commenting on a Facebook post and the exchange went something like this:</p><blockquote><strong>Them</strong>: I think [subculture] is fading out because it&#x2019;s being softened by the surrounding culture of the city.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Me</strong>: Actually, that seems insufficiently parsimonious to me. I think a simpler explanation is that people in [subculture] are aging.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Someone else</strong>: You don&#x2019;t even need to suppose it&#x2019;s aging related. It&#x2019;s probably just regression to the mean.</blockquote><blockquote>Me:</blockquote><span><figure><img src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*b0zPzHTEMBSDEnoQlfwMYA.gif"" class=""draft-image "" style=""width:40%""></figure></span><p>So to atone for my sin of neglecting the most likely reason anything ever happens, I present to you my penance&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;an introduction to regression to the mean.</p><h3>Regressive Statistics</h3><p>Suppose you are sitting on a park bench, watching people walk by. You notice the height of each person that passes you and develop a sense for how the height of people at the park is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution"">distributed</a>. After some time a friend joins you on the bench and, hearing about what you&#x2019;ve been doing, ask you if the next person to walk by is likely to be taller or shorter than the last person who did.</p><p>Regression to the mean tells you how to answer this. Whatever the distribution of the heights of the park goers, each person who walks by, lacking any other information to inform your decision, is likely to be in the direction of the mean within the height distribution relative to the previous person. So if a short person walks by, you tell your friend the next person is likely to be taller and vice versa, and most of the time you will be right!</p><p>There are several ways to understand why this works, but I think the most straightforward is to think in terms of sampling from a distribution. You know the heights of the people you&#x2019;ve seen in the park, so if you charted a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram"">histogram</a> of their height measurements you&#x2019;d get a picture that looked approximately like this:</p><span><figure><img src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*o3xlC-WjWI4DHMVWnWj7mg.png"" class=""draft-image "" style=""width:40%""></figure></span><p>Then if you observe someone of any particular height, you can divide the histogram into two sections: those shorter than the observed height and those taller. Because of the way the data is distributed, though, the side with the mean will always have more of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_density_function"">probability density</a> than the other side, so it is always more likely than not that the next sample will be in the direction where the mean is located. Thus the tendency to regress towards the mean.</p><span><figure><img src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*uhyhIiKLbgKJrXclCLr_9Q.png"" class=""draft-image "" style=""width:40%""></figure></span><p>Note though that regression to the mean does not imply that the next person to walk by will likely be closer to the mean, just more likely to be in the direction of it relative to the last sample. The distinction is important because for observations close to the mean the opposite&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;that the next person is farther away from the mean than the previous person&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;is more likely to be true because of variance. For example, if a person is only 1 inch taller than average but the variance in height is 6 inches, the next person is more likely to be more than 1 inch shorter/taller than average than the last person and thus farther away from the mean. After all, regression to the mean <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem#Calculating_the_variance"">applies to variance too</a>.</p><p>But you probably don&#x2019;t care much about how tall people are, so I hope you are asking yourself &#x201C;what else can I use this for?&#x201D;. As it turns out, <a href=""http://maximum-entropy-blog.blogspot.com/2012/12/the-regression-fallacy.html"">just about everything</a>.</p><h3>Put a Number on&#xA0;It</h3><p>I might not go as far as <a href=""https://medium.com/u/2324b59937e8"">Jacob Falkovich</a> in my desire to <a href=""https://putanumonit.com/"">put numbers to things</a>, but a lot of opportunities open up <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/i8n/how_to_measure_anything/"">if you think of the world as measurable</a>, even when it seems <a href=""https://putanumonit.com/2017/03/12/goddess-spreadsheet/"">totally impossible to take measurements</a>. Being able to use regression to the mean as an explanation is one such opportunity.</p><p>Take the conversation that spawned this post as an example: someone said that a subculture had grown &#x201C;less distinct&#x201D; over time, but for a subculture to be less or more distinct means we must be able to measure it in terms of distinctness. It doesn&#x2019;t really matter for our purposes how this measurement is done, just that we can take a measure. Once we have our measure we can take sample measurements of different subcultures at different times and come up with a distribution of subcultures&#x2019; distinctnesses. Then it&#x2019;s straight forward to say that more distinct subcultures are likely to become less distinct over time and vice versa because subsequent measures are likely to regress to the mean. If it looks like a subculture is less distinct now than it used to be, the obvious line of reasoning should be that its distinctness is regressing to the mean.</p><p>We can similarly <a href=""http://opensourcevolleyball.blogspot.com/2015/09/positive-vs-negative-feedback-or.html"">apply regression to the mean</a> to help understand almost anything we can measure&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;test scores, fashion, salaries, productivity, <a href=""https://hbdchick.wordpress.com/2014/06/22/ibn-khaldun-notices-regression-to-the-mean-and-entropy/"">prestige</a>, cuteness, etc.&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_toward_the_mean#Misunderstandings"">but only if we apply it correctly</a>. Consider students in a class where their grade is determined by a midterm and final exam. Does regression to the mean imply that students who do poorly on the midterm will do better on the final exam and vice-versa? No. The trouble is that the students&#x2019; scores are not <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_and_identically_distributed_random_variables"">identically and independently distributed</a> random variables: how they perform on the midterm impacts how they will perform on the final. Some possibilities:</p><ul><li>A student who gets a bad score on the midterm may study harder to get a better score on the final so they can pass the class.</li><li>A student who gets a good score on the midterm may slack off because they can get a lower score on the final and still pass the class.</li><li>A student who does well on the midterm may also do well on the final because they study hard all semester.</li><li>A student who fails the midterm may give up and drop the class or stop studying and intentionally fail.</li></ul><p>In the language of control systems we might say the students are <a href=""https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2011/10/mental-model-feedback-loops/"">negative feedback loops</a> working to keep their inputs on target, and in the language of information theory we would say that our samples (test scores) from each random variable (student) possess <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_information"">mutual information</a>. We won&#x2019;t see regression to the mean in this case, though, even if all the students followed a move-in-the-direction-of-the-mean pattern, and any such resemblance to regression to the mean would be coincidental, because regression to the mean is what happens when nothing tries to affect the value measured. If work is being done then regression to the mean is not happening.</p><h3>Entropic Regression</h3><p>This sounds an awful lot like regression to the mean should never happen since the universe is full of things doing work, everything is <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/r5/the_quantum_physics_sequence/"">tangled up</a> with everything else, and mutual information always exists except when <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe"">it doesn&#x2019;t matter</a>. We could suppose to the contrary that every instance of what we think is regression to the mean is actually negative feedback, but this hardly seems <a href=""https://mapandterritory.org/what-value-epicycles-f8358678a23a"">parsimonious</a> since nothing happening is generally more likely than something happening, and any feedback whatsoever demands at least <a href=""https://mapandterritory.org/phenomenological-complexity-classes-8b41836437b9"">phenomenological consciousness</a>. So how can it be that we see regression to the mean so often if in reality the conditions of its operation are never met?</p><p>The answer is <a href=""http://dsw.users.sonic.net/entropy.html"">entropy</a>. Regression to the mean isn&#x2019;t a process so much as a manifestation of the general tendency of the universe to move towards low energy states as seen through the lens of statistics. Thus it&#x2019;s not that the existence of mutual information prevents regression to the mean from happening, but that mutual information is the work being done to counteract regression to the mean, and if the amount mutual information is too small&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;if not enough entropy is displaced to notice a local rise in complexity&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;then it fades into the background noise and goes unnoticed because it&#x2019;s weaker than the static that is regression to the mean.</p><span><figure><img src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*K16UFxSzv7YFuQ63xNWLHQ.png"" class=""draft-image "" style=""width:40%""></figure></span><p>This is the &#x201C;real&#x201D; reason regression to the mean explains so much: it&#x2019;s what happens by default if nobody does anything. Regression to the mean, entropy, static, noise, and <a href=""https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=kipple"">kipple</a> are all the same &#x201C;thing&#x201D; in that they are all the no-thing of emptiness that fills the void between intentional stuff. They are the yin to purposeful work&#x2019;s yang; the resting state everything returns to absent effort. Thus regression to the mean is one of the many ways we see the nothing out of which the workings of <a href=""https://mapandterritory.org/the-personal-growth-cycle-34ec1c218615"">extropy or Dao</a> are born.</p>",gworley,gordon-seidoh-worley,Gordon Seidoh Worley,

I left academic math because I wanted to do something that had a bigger (i.e. any) impact on the world around me. I also wanted to get out of the extremely perverse academic job market.</p><p>Since then, I’ve designed taught courses on machine learning and am now working as a data scientist for a large company you’ve heard of (but not that one). In some respects I feel like my background in math better prepared me for this job than I can imagine a data science program doing—I think my desire for a higher burden of proof than p=.05 is one of the most important things I’ve brought to the table in all the projects I’ve touched. I’ve also gotten a lot out of my background on LessWrong, mostly because it’s the only place I’ve ever really studied statistics. You’d think you couldn’t get a math PhD without doing at least a little stats, but you’d be wrong.</p><p>Anyway there is one aspect of data science that I’m definitely behind the curve on, and that’s the software engineering side. In particular, as a mathematician I’m very read to grab a hold of a lot of abstraction and then tuck it into a black box and then reopen it whenever it doesn’t work exactly how I expect. But in the modern data science community, there are a ton of abstractions and they’ve only been boxed up inconsistently.</p><p>I read a lot about deep learning research, both on LessWrong and for work, and there are a ton of interesting experiments that I would like to replicate and a handful of original research ideas I’d like to try out, just in brief prototypes to see if they are even worth exploring or thinking about. To do this, what I want is something like the ability to write the following code:</p><pre style=""overflow:scroll;""><code>model = pre_trained_alexnet()<br/>GAN = generative_adversarial_network()<br/>model.transfer(new_task())<br/>GAN.aggrieve(model,new_task())</code></pre><p>While it may be possible to do things like this, especially with libraries like keras, this isn’t where most introductions to deep learning start.</p><p>Frustratingly for me, they almost all start with a huge series of videos on how to implement backpropagation where they insist that it’s not really that bad if you don’t understand all the calculus. To me this feels like doing absolutely nothing—these parts of the process have already been well established and optimized beyond my ability to contribute meaningfully. What I want to work with is higher levels of abstraction, looking at what architectures perform well on which problems, what level of data augmentation improves accuracy and what level causes overfitting, etc.</p><p>Anyway I don’t get anywhere by sitting around complaining about how teaching is hard and not everyone is perfect at adapting to my unique situation as a student, so I’m focusing on self-improvement and I’m hoping to keep myself responsible about it for at least a couple of weeks by writing about my progress. With any luck this will end up being a useful resource for others in my circumstances but no promises.</p><p>So for now, I’ll outline a few near-term (the next week), medium term (by the end of the year), and longer term (within a couple of years) goals that I have for myself.</p><h3>Near term activities:</h3><p>Right now I am taking the coursera deep learning specialization. I’m not very synced up with the official course schedule, mostly because in these initial “compute derivatives and parrot definitions of bias and variance” stages I can get through 2-3 weeks of material in a day. I don’t feel like I’ve had a strong learning experience yet, though I’m optimistic that this will improve in later courses, but this does keep me focused and will be advantageous for future interviews since it reinforces basics and will give me a certificate I can put on a resume.</p><h3>Medium term goals:</h3><p>There are a ton of research papers I’d like to replicate the results of, but there are two in particular that I’d like to understand the connections between: ‘Deep Reinforcement Learning for Human Preferences’ by Christiano et. al., and ‘&quot;Why should I trust you?&quot; explaining the predictions of any classifier’ by Ribeiro et. al.</p><p>The first uses weakly directed reinforcement learning augmented by occasional sparse human feedback to build complicated reward functions. The second constructs model agnostic explanations for single classifications of supervised learners and dictates a mechanism for non-experts to select quality learners or potentially improve learners by rating their explanations for different predictions.</p><p>I’d like to use the process of the first on the second, to see if I can train a very poorly calibrated network on image classification or to see if I can use explanations to make such a network more robust to adversarial examples. Hopefully in the next 10 weeks I can learn enough basic tools for deep learning that setting up this kind of experiment is not so daunting.</p><h3>Long term goals:</h3><p>What I would really like to have is a nice setup of things like Atari environments for deep reinforcement learning, the ability to easily do apprenticeship and inverse reinforcement learning from this environment, and a familiar code base for building evolutionary algorithms and adversarial examples. My guess is that 80-90% of the codebase I want already exists, but that something like 30-40% of it is maintained on personal github pages by grad students and the libraries take significant work to compile.</p><p>I’ll try to continue this with 10-15 minute TIL updates until November, when my writing time will be dedicated to NaNoWriMo.</p><p>If anyone wants to follow along or talk on some Discord some time about studying, or if you have suggestions for good/better places to learn these sorts of things, please let me know!</p></div></div></div></div>",magfrump,magfrump,magfrump,

This will hopefully make the visual    distinction between the frontpage and personal blog pages clearer, and    generally improve navigation on the page.  </p><p>+ Users will eventually be able to set their own personal color that will show up in their header and on a few navigation elements on their profile <br/>+ Their will be unique colors for R:A-Z, The Codex and HPMOR that will serve a similar function  <br/>+ Meta will also get its own color </p><h3>Voting backend-revamp</h3><p>The vote backend has been revamped. So far this shouldn&#x27;t have any effect on    your user experience (besides slightly faster load times), but will soon allow us to implement gradual upvoting and downvoting where users can decide to upvote or downvote something n-times, where n is their current vote-weight. This also means there was about a 20-minute period before this push in which your votes might have been reset, I apologize if that happened to anyone. </p><h3>Editor streamlining and advanced editor!</h3><p>We removed the far too numerous and mostly useless selection of headers in    the Toolbar and replaced it with two heading sizes, which should be enough    for the vast majority of use-cases (and is also what&#x27;s most common on other    content sites like Medium).</p><p>You can now access our advanced editor on post pages! This allows you to    insert images and a variety of other things into your posts. I am not a huge fan of the UI, but it&#x27;s a very powerful editor that allows you to create basically whatever formatting you want, so it&#x27;s somewhat hard to make the UI super simple as well. You can access the editor by pressing the palette icon on the right side of the editor Toolbar. (That button also exists for comment editors, but currently doesn&#x27;t do anything. We will remove it soon from there) </p><p>We also fixed a bunch of smaller bugs in a variety of places. Let me know what you think, and whether you discover any new bugs. Also expect some more performance improvements to finally be pushed soon.</p></div></div></div></div>",habryka4,habryka4,habryka,

I want to point at how I think LessWrong is more aligned with the Western way of truth-seeking. </p><p>[ Epistemic status is speculative / playful. ]</p><p>One illustration of the distinction is that there was a study where Japanese and American students were shown images of fish tanks[<a href=""http://www.pnas.org/content/100/19/11163.full"">1</a>]. Later, they were asked to recall the scene. Japanese students were twice as likely to recall background objects. They also often started by describing the environment—“it looked like a pond.” While Americans were more likely to describe the foreground—“there were three big fish swimming to the left.” The Japanese attended more to the context and relationships within the image, while the Americans attended more to the &quot;main actors.&quot; </p><p>Some pattern-matching words to further triangulate the difference here: </p><blockquote><p><em>East Asians see things in context, while Westerners focus on the point at hand; the former are dependent, the latter independent; the former are holistic, the latter analytic. … Asians are collectivistic, Westerners individualistic. [</em><a href=""https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2009/0511/024-opinions-science-psychology-ideas-opinions.html""><em>2</em></a><em>]</em></p></blockquote><p>LessWrong feels like a further continuation of this long-standing, analytic Western tradition. </p><blockquote><p>1. It features anonymous users (wiping clean the context of name, social group, cultural background, etc.). </p><p>2. It has a sense of “the argument should stand for itself.” It doesn’t matter who writes it—the words themselves should be taken into consideration and judged to be convincing or not. The truth will be evaluated based solely on the logical structure, the content, and the evidence. Similar to how mathematical proofs don’t rely on the perspective of the person constructing it or the one reading it. </p><p>3. It tries to keep emotion at bay. There is a sense that emotion risks making things distracting or “<a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/17/the-toxoplasma-of-rage/"">tribal</a>.” Emotion takes away clear-headedness and <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/gw/politics_is_the_mindkiller/"">disables people’s ability to think</a>. Signs of hostility or aggression are quick to be pointed out in comments. The implication is that one of the jobs of moderation is to keep discussion free of emotional charge. Again, it seems the point is to highlight the argument on its own ground and to remove the “background layers” of emotion and <a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/10/09/in-favor-of-futurism-being-about-the-future/"">social signaling</a>, as much as possible. </p></blockquote><p>These features hint at underlying assumptions about the nature of reality and Truth. LessWrong was formed as an attempt to clarify, carve out, and discover this Truth, given the assumptions about how an enlightened mind goes about the business of finding Truth in the first place. What kinds of assumptions are those?</p><p>From the paper referenced at the beginning: </p><blockquote><p><em>Another example concerns metaphysics or fundamental assumptions about the nature of the world, together with the cognitive processes that followed from the metaphysical assumptions. The Greeks tended to focus on the object and to explain its behavior with reference only to its properties and the categories to which it belonged. Aristotle explained a stone&#x27;s falling when placed in water by invoking the notion that the stone had the property of “gravity,” and explained a piece of wood&#x27;s floating on water by reference to the wood&#x27;s property of “levity.” In contrast, the Chinese recognized that action always occurs in a field of forces, understood much about magnetism and acoustics, and recognized the true reason for the tides (which escaped even Galileo). The Greeks were inclined to see matter as being composed of discrete objects or atoms, whereas the Chinese were disposed to see matter as continuous substances, even as interpenetrating substances. Finally, the Greeks tended to see stability in the world (e.g., Plato&#x27;s forms), whereas the Chinese saw the world as constantly changing, indeed, in line with the yin and yang of the Tao, as always being in the process of reverting to the opposite of the current state.</em></p></blockquote><p>To me, these assumptions about reality feel related to why Europe ventured to find new land across the ocean in the 1400’s, while China—despite having the technology and resources—did not bother to look. It feels related to why Europe was the center of the Enlightenment and the Scientific Revolution. It feels related to why America is the champion of capitalism, freedom of religion, and escaping from older traditions and cultures. </p><p>On causal attribution and prediction: </p><blockquote><p><em>We might expect that Westerners, like ancient Greek scientists, would be inclined to explain events by reference to properties of the object and that East Asians would be inclined to explain the same events with reference to interactions between the object and the field. There is much evidence indicating that this is the case (for reviews, see refs. 18-20). Morris and Peng (21) and Lee et al. (22) have shown that Americans are inclined to explain murders and sports events respectively by invoking presumed traits, abilities, or other characteristics of the individual, whereas Chinese and Hong Kong citizens are more likely to explain the same events with reference to contextual factors, including historical ones. Cha and Nam (23) and Choi and Nisbett (24) found that East Asians used more contextual information than did Americans in making causal attributions. The same is true for predictions.</em></p></blockquote><p>On logic vs. dialectics: </p><blockquote><p><em>When told that all birds have a certain property, people are more inclined to agree that eagles have the property than that penguins have the property, even though, if asked, they would of course say that penguins are birds. Norenzayan et al. (26) showed that Korean participants were more susceptible to this so-called “typicality” effect in deduction. Koreans were also more likely than Americans to be influenced by the desirability of a proposition when judging whether it was logically consistent with propositions to which it was related deductively. A series of studies by Peng and Nisbett (27) showed that Chinese are more comfortable with apparent contradictions than are Americans. They showed that Chinese participants had a greater preference for proverbs that contain an apparent contradiction (“too humble is half proud”) than did American participants (even when the proverbs were Yiddish ones and equally unfamiliar to Americans and Chinese). They also found that the Chinese were more likely to propose “middle way” solutions to inter- and intrapersonal conflicts than were Americans, who seemed to find it necessary that one side or the other had to be correct. When presented with evidence for apparently contradictory propositions, Chinese participants tried to find truth in both, whereas Americans were more inclined to reject one proposition in favor of the other.</em></p></blockquote><h2>What is the Western view of Truth?</h2><p>Perhaps that Truth has discrete elements that can be manipulated, observed, or measured. Phrases like “cutting nature at its joints” point at a sense of Truth having concrete outlines—that concepts have edges. Also, that it is possible to see objects independently of their contexts. That I can name things, categorize them, and create new taxonomies for them. There is an emphasis on definitions, symbols, rules, and linear structures in argument. </p><p>Given that this post is an attempt at putting LessWrong into a larger, historical context—maybe you can already guess which way I tend to lean naturally. </p><p>I am trying to avoid making explicit claims about which is “better.” There are clearly certain arenas that the West has come to dominate.

Ask yourself “what is it about this person—their past, history, social context—such that they are saying this right now?” Allow yourself to build models about people’s culture, ancestry, and personal history and how that affects how they see and process the world. (Try not to be essentialist about it. <a href=""https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Fundamental_attribution_error"">Fundamental attribution error</a>, <a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Typical_mind_fallacy"">typical mind fallacy</a>, hold your beliefs lightly, etc.) </p><p>Maybe try boggling at Scott&#x27;s <a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/10/02/different-worlds/"">Different Worlds</a> post.</p><p>And furthermore, occasionally try naming the things you are noticing and see what happens. </p><p>[ Just to be clear, I’m not trying to say something essentialist myself.

I further suggest naming what is at stake, so that it becomes clear where the emotion is coming from. </p><p>E.g. “I notice I feel defensive. I think the thing I’m defending is…” or “I’m worried that a particular point will be under-considered, and this will cause…” </p><p>Getting into more specifics and consulting the emotion for more info seems like a useful move to have available.

Alpha Go Zero equalled the ability of a system trained with supervised learning on a Go profession game corpus in 24 hours (using the same computing resources) and exceeded the ability of the version of Alpha Go that defeated Lee Sedol in 48 hours.</p><p>This surprised me. I remember Demis Hassabis saying during the Lee Sedol game coverage that he&#x27;d like to look at learning Go from scratch, using only self play and no supervised learning from human games. I thought that that sounded much harder, and guessed that if supervised training times were on the order of a month then from scratch it would take anywhere from three months to years to recapitulate what was learned from human games.</p><p>Other things I noted from the paper were that Alpha Go Master (which played and won 50 games against professional players in 2016-2017) used a different architecture to the previous versions, and is about 12 times more computationally efficient as well as being a significantly better player. Zero is based on that architecture (I think), and took about 35 days of training (i.e. self-play) to equal, and then exceed Master&#x27;s ability. I don&#x27;t know how long Master took to train, but going by the results of this paper I&#x27;m guessing that the supervised training would have provided maybe only a day or so worth of head-start compared to zero.</p></div></div></div></div>",Kyre,kyre,Kyre,

I think discussions about natalism would work better if people made more distinctions.</p><p>When I searched for information on it I found that people had previously made a distinction between <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/parenthood/#GroLimRigPro"">global and local anti-natalism</a>, where local anti-natalism holds that at least some people shouldn&#x27;t reproduce and global anti-natalism holds that everyone shouldn&#x27;t reproduce. I feel this is not a very satisfactory division; for one thing, I&#x27;m not sure if there is anyone who isn&#x27;t a local anti-natalist by this taxonomy.</p><p>So here are my proposed replacements:</p><p><strong>Very strong anti-natalism</strong>. It is morally wrong to have children. The human race should slowly go extinct. For example: <a href=""http://vhemt.org/"">Human beings cause irreversible harm to the biosphere, which is intrinsically valuable.</a> <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Better-Never-Have-Been-Existence/dp/0199549265"">It is possible to harm a person by creating them but not to benefit them (nonexistent people are not harmed by being deprived of good things), so bringing people into existence is always a great harm to them.</a></p><p><strong>Strong anti-natalism</strong>. In general, people should not have children; there are a very few exceptions. For example: Most human lives, even in the developed world, are not worth living and unless you have a strong reason to suspect your child&#x27;s life would be worth living, it is wrong to have a child.</p><p><strong>Weak anti-natalism</strong>. People should err on the side of having children less than they currently do. For example: Raising children is a waste of resources that are better spent improving the lives of already existing people. <a href=""http://amzn.to/2zkP3iu"">Most people don&#x27;t enjoy interacting with children, and having children tends to worsen marriages and make people more stressed and unhappy</a> (please note that while the first few chapters of this book are anti-natalist, overall the book comes to a pro-natalist conclusion). It would be easier to solve environmental problems if there were fewer humans.</p><p><strong>Natalism neutrality</strong>. It is difficult to make general conclusions about whether people should have children. Some people should err on the side of having more children than they currently are, while other people should err on the side of having fewer children. For example: many traits are genetic and only people with desirable traits should have children. Many people who would be good parents have few or no children, while many people who are really crappy parents have children anyway.</p><p><strong>Weak pro-natalism</strong>. People should err on the side of having children more than they currently do. For example: t<a href=""http://amzn.to/2zkP3iu"">he effort of parenting is upfront while the good parts are later in life, and many people parent in a way that makes them stressed and unhappy and thus have an inaccurate idea of how pleasant parenting can be</a>. We need more people to support our aging population; the more people there are, the fewer taxes people have to pay to provide public goods such as scientific research, weather forecasting, and military defense (which do not increase in cost when the population increases), and all else equal the lower the per capita national debt.</p><p><strong>Strong pro-natalism</strong>. In general, people should have children; it is morally wrong not to do so. For example: most people&#x27;s lives are happy, and creating happy people is a great good, one of the greatest benefits you can provide a person. The purpose of human life from an evolutionary perspective is to reproduce, and people should obey their evolutionary imperatives.</p><p><strong>Very strong pro-natalism</strong>. It is morally wrong not to have children (except perhaps in a handful of extreme cases). For example: Some <a href=""http://www.patheos.com/blogs/nolongerquivering/what-is-quiverfull/"">Quiverfull</a> belief systems. A philosophy in which prospective people with net-positive lives are harmed by not being created and therefore we should create as many of them as possible. Some variants of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average_and_total_utilitarianism#Total_utilitarianism"">total utilitarianism</a>.</p><p>I am personally natalism neutral, although weakly pro-natalism for people sufficiently similar to me, and strongly anti-natalist for farmed animals. (I do not think there is sufficient evidence to be anything but agnostic on wild animal natalism.)</p></div></div></div></div>",ozymandias,ozymandias,ozymandias,

However, this also needs to be reconciled with evolutionary psychology arguments that are psychological functioning has evolved to maximise our reproductive fitness, a big part of which is survival. This post attempts to synthesise these two views. I would also like to suggest a new term, De-Centering Bias to describe this technique given how it marks a shift from bias being the central explanation, to bias having to share the stage with other considerations. The best way to understand this is by example:</p><p>(This post was originally title Post-Bias Thinking (or Post-Bias-ism). Unsurprisingly, this was controversial, so I decided to rename it.)</p><p><strong>Example 1</strong>, one of the most famous experiments in psychology is the <a href=""https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Stanford_marshmallow_experiment"">Stanford Marshmallow Experiment</a>, which was originally interpreted as showing that children who could resist eating one marshmallow now for the promise of two later tended to have better life outcomes. However, <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/hw6/a_new_interpretation_of_the_marshmallow_test/"">later interpretations</a> showed that this could actually be rational for children in some environments where such promises were not reliable and that the presence of such an environment could explain these results by being a common cause of both effects.</p><p><strong>Example 2</strong>, often revenge will make people take actions that harm both them and the other person. If we model an actor as a self-interested rational agent then we will come to the conclusion that they are being &quot;irrational&quot;. On the other hand, if an actor is willing to go to such extreme lengths to punish someone who wrongs them, then there is a strong incentive not to wrong them in the first place (Scott has argued that it could be considered <a href=""http://squid314.livejournal.com/309196.html"">charitable</a> because it also created a disincentive within the wider community). In the Most Convenient World, the actor will gain the benefits of such a threat existing, whilst never having to carry out their threat.</p><p><strong>Example 3</strong>, the <a href=""https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Sunk_cost"">sunk cost fallacy</a> is the tendency of humans to want to continue a project that they have invested a lot of resources (time, money, effort) into, even if the project is not valuable enough to be worth the resources required to finish the project. When discussing this fallacy we need to be aware that human are not rational agents in that we will often be too lazy to engage in activities that would be worthwhile. Wanting to continue projects in which we have invested large amounts of time in allows us to counter this tendency. So if we were able to press a button and remove sunk cost considerations from our brain, I would not be surprised if this was to make us less effective as an agent (as Elizier says, it is dangerous to be half a rationalist, <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/cz/the_craft_and_the_community/"">link</a>, there&#x27;s a better link somewhere, but I can&#x27;t find it). But further than that, taking a Virtue Ethics approach, every time you complete a project, you become more like the kind of person who completes projects, so sometimes it might be worth completing a project just so that you completed it, rather than for the actual value the project provides. In this case, this bias seems to make us more rational by mitigating a different way in which we are irrational.</p><p></p><p><strong>De-centering Bias is not</strong>:</p><p>The belief that &quot;Bias-Centered Thinking&quot; is wrong all or even most of the time, as opposed to being a challenge that forces us to refine our thoughts further.</p><p>The belief that <em>all</em> biases have benefits attached. Sometimes attributes evolve merely as side effects. Sometimes they harm us, but not enough to affect our reproductive success (h/t Alwhite).</p><p>Limited to game theoretic considerations. See the discussion of the sunk cost fallacy above.</p><p><strong>In conclusion</strong>, De-Centering Thinking is incredibly simple. All I&#x27;m asking you to do is to stop and pause for a second after you&#x27;ve been told that something is a bias and think about whether there are any countervailing considerations. I believe that this is an important area to examine as you could probably fill an entire sequence by expanding this analysis to different biases. </p><p><strong>Suggestions for Further Discussion</strong>: What is something that is generally considered a bias or fallacy, but where you believe that there are also other considerations?</p><p></p><p></p>",Chris_Leong,chris_leong,Chris_Leong,

We have a certain degree of power over what to offer to the customer, and our biases and pet horses are going to contribute a lot to what theoreticians infer about ""the actual public""'s tastes. Just how a lot it is, I cannot say, &amp; there's probably tons of literature on this anyway, so take this as a personal anecdote.</p>
<p>Nine months as a teacher of botany (worst gripes <a href=""/lw/nnn/how_my_something_to_protect_just_coalesced_into/"">here</a>) showed me a glimpse of how teachers/administration view the field they teach. A year in a shop - what managers think of books we sell. The scientific community here in my country grumbles that there's too little non-fiction produced, without actually looking into why it's not being distributed; but really, it's small wonder. <strong>Broadest advice</strong> - if your <em>sufficiently </em>weird goals depend on the cooperation of a network of people, especially if they are an established profession with which you haven't had a cause to interact closely except as a customer, you might want to ask what they think of your enterprise. Because they aren't going to see it your way. Next thing, is to accept it.<a id=""more""></a></p>
<p>I work in a bookshop that is a part of a publishing house and also sells some selected books from several dozens of other PHs. Think about 9000 kinds of ""our"" products + 4000 kinds of ""theirs"".</p>
<p>Recently, things changed a bit. Two wonderful professionals retired, one was given a very different administrative position, and one went on to another job because she didn't want to adjust to a new team after 10+ years with the old one.</p>
<p>It made me, for a while, the unofficial authority on literature for adults and non-fiction non-school-related-stuff for kids. (My new colleagues currently specialize in: maps and atlases (our ""senior salesperson""); stationery and such; ""books in general"" without knowing the products of the publishing houses we have historically dealt with (edit: the person does have several months of relevant experience); logistics; and organizing everybody. They are all willing, capable and smart and will get acquainted with this specific job too soon enough, if they don't go on to something else. Just listing their backgrounds as examples of people who actually sell the thing.) I waited until the rush for textbooks mostly petered out and started to Enjoy My Power for the Sake of the Greater Good (TM).</p>
<p>Meaning, I sent a few requests for some additions to our stores. Then the phone rang.</p>
<p>""It's [the central office], they want to know why do we need as many as five of that man who mistook his wife for a hat? Nobody buys it.""</p>
<p>And there are perfectly good reasons for a shop to not have precisely that book. The translation into Ukrainian is recent, and we didn't have anything by the publishing house before, so customers don't expect such things from us and won't ask about it for some time yet. The change needs to get momentum, and it might not <em>ever </em>get momentum if we put that book on a shelf and let people pass it, but it won't be the end of the world. There are other places in Kyiv where you can find anything to your taste.</p>
<p>The guy from [the central office] didn't need to say it out loud. He was amused, polite and supportive, and of course we received the five requested copies which I immediately bought and presented to my friends and relatives within a week (one insisted on buying it from me); but it was made clear that we should be more selective.</p>
<p>And I went then to the storeroom to look at stuff like the history of Ukrainian football that will never be out of date because it's about the Good Times, and a book about accounting that is so out of date it's no use for anything but insulation, and that one about boxing; they are practically never bought, but we are obligated to have them because we are officially a branch of a particular publishing house that owns [the central office]. There are whole <em>series </em>of fiction we keep in case the author needs a few for a presentation.</p>
<p>I talked about it with my new colleagues. The stationery one quietly asked me to request another MWMHWFaH, because she'd taken a peek and liked it; the logistics one shrugged and said he hadn't heard of the writer; the general-books one made an interested face; and the maps-and-atlases moaned that we'd have to count everything for the grand revision we're about to have. The organising-everyone one will talk to me himself, if he sees fit.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>So now I plan to put a photo album on ""my"" desk, with pictures of the stuff I'd like to sell and the relevant data to easily compose a request for literature, with YOU CAN ORDER written on the cover. And a big notebook for customers' recommendations (ideally, we'd have a microphone to record them.) And maybe a poster with some author portraits near the entrance, laminated. But it's a tiny patch on a hole that eats itself; the main problem is that <em>non-fiction books are considered entertainment for kids and YAs.</em> (I can pitch most things I like as directed at YAs with a straight face, too.) Not for grown-ups.</p>
<p>And one can shout at the top of one's lungs that hurray, we do have popular books on e.g. math and physics, but 1) they are way more ""popular"" than even Soviet-era books were, and those are <em>old</em>, and foreign books are <em>expensive</em>, and 2) nobody ever hears about them except from a few fanatics and I don't believe that reading your kid fairy tales is good preparation for heavier stuff. For the stuff that you don't even know exists. There are just too few people who can recommend them, and then books go to the shops to die, and then managers don't want to satisfy other shops' requests for more, and then - it ends.</p>
<p>And on-line bookshops are not doing that great here [citation needed].</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>So, next time you think about putting your ideas into some defined format designed for easy distribution and wide adoption, put in a term for the middleman and it will move your estimates closer to the truth.</p>",MaryCh,marych,MaryCh,

<p class=""p1"">I'm not trying to explain my reasoning fully here - some of this I've already covered, some I plan to cover later. I expect no one to be <em>persuaded</em> by this post - but I hope it's helpful context. And this is just my current best guess, subject to change as I learn more.</p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">There are many subcultures that seem okay, but the dominant, elite, world-ruling culture is a homogenizing, commodifying force. This culture is ultimately self-defeating - it is currently at war with itself and in the process of <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/04/22/against-facebook/"">destroying its own attention</a> - but it is unfortunately the only culture I know of that has the tools to do life-extension research and space travel.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Because the central regime has lost most of its deliberative capacity, persuading it to change is not an option. We need a sustainable alternative.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">There are alternative “sustainable” cultures. Some are even growing. Earthship is an example. But the ones that have avoided triggering society’s immune system are mostly not <i>complete</i> in the relevant sense - they're not the sort of thing that make efficient use of the whole accessible universe, for human flourishing. In particular, they seem targeted for static sustainability, not technical or intellectual progress. “Sustainability” is not quite the right term. A culture that is productive, and trying to live, would be closer.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">There have been revolutionaries who tried to seize power and reform the whole system at once. This usually ends in either catastrophic failure, or more of the same, unless it is a conservative revolution like the American one. The problem is that optimizing for seizing power can easily destroy the information you might want to preserve about how to do better.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Instead, we need to construct a seed that will grow into the right thing. This seed needs to be sustainable at all levels, not something that will <i>only</i> pay off at the last stage. This is how you avoid failures like revolutionary Communism. It also needs to grow, without being dependent on growth. If you don’t grow, you don’t replace the empire. If you depend on growth, you may not actually be productive, and may instead collapse when you reach the limit of your range.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">We need an alternative that does not depend on permanent growth, but knows how to make and retain intellectual and technological progress.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">I’m currently trying to think through the attributes of the seed myself, but I’m not going to be enough. So I’m going to see if I can bootstrap my way up to this. I’m hoping that public discourse about the problems of the modern central system will help me find others with the ability to work out what’s needed. I’d like to identify a small number of people - six seems about right - to live in a house together for six months, build shared models, and work out what to do next.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The participants should have already demonstrated ability to participate in the relevant discourse. Thus, my recruiting funnel is also my recruiting filter.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Living in a house together would help us learn to lean into information-sharing norms, as we share in the work of figuring out how to live well together. Things as simple as keeping the house clean would provide a concrete task where we all care about and experience the outcome. Unfortunately, this excludes people who already have their own families and are rooted in different places. I’m open to alternative proposals.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Here’s what I already think about the seed culture. Since there is no guarantee that this will be the last seed culture we ever need, scholarship is a pragmatically important part of this culture, as it will help us hold onto some steering power. Local production and trade are also important, for two reasons. They will directly help us orient our discourse around fundamentally honest shared-production norms, rather than fundamentally extractive shared-consumption norms. And they will help us resist central cultural programming. I am not sure full autarky is necessary, desirable, or even feasible, but local production of housing, child care, basic medical care, and some aspects of food (at least shared quality control of purchases from outside) seems like it would help us avoid some cost-disease traps, freeing up time for leisure.</span></p>

That means it explains the <em>how</em> but not the <em>why</em>. As a brief summary, Attractor Theory basically states that you should consider any action you take as having meta-level effects on changing your local preferences for which actions feel desirable. </p><p>That is to say, taking actions changes which actions you’ll take, later down the road.</p><p>I’ll first introduce the three parts of the model, then I’ll go over the implications of the model.</p><p>1) First, there’s <strong>You</strong>. Imagine that you’re in a clear hamster ball:</p><p><strong>IMAGE: </strong><a href=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*gEu9UeKBdLyDBtQo.""><strong>https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*gEu9UeKBdLyDBtQo.</strong></a></p><p>As a human inside this ball, you can kinda roll around by exerting energy. But it’s hard to do so all of the time — you’d likely get tired. Still, if you really wanted to, you could push the ball and move.</p><p>We’ll explore this later, but you can basically think of the energy you have left for rolling as a proxy for willpower. </p><p>2) Second, there are these <strong>Utilons</strong>, which just represent stuff you want.</p><p><strong>IMAGE: </strong><a href=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*HUqxllO2S_BiZkEv.""><strong>https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*HUqxllO2S_BiZkEv</strong>.</a></p><p>They represent productivity hours, lives saved, HPMOR fan-fictions written, or anything else you care about getting a lot of. As a human in a hamster ball, you are trying to roll around and collect as many Utilons as possible.</p><p>3) Third, there are all these <strong>Attractors</strong> that pull you in. </p><p><strong>IMAGE: </strong><a href=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*vandHod3cgtgnGZb.""><strong>https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*vandHod3cgtgnGZb</strong>.</a></p><p>And, uh, technically, anything could be an Attractor. But that clearly isn’t useful. A more concrete framing is to think of Attractors as actions or situations. For example, reading a book, going on vacation, and doing some pushups are all examples of Attractors.</p><p>The bottom line is that something is classified as an Attractor if it changes how you currently feel.</p><p>(I know this is still pretty vague, but there are some more examples later, so you might want to just black-box it for now.)</p><p>Attractors are like valleys or magnets. The point is that there’s a potential difference, which causes them to pull you, in your little hamster ball, towards them.</p><p style=""text-align:center;"">++++</p><h2><strong>Details:</strong></h2><p>That’s the gist of this model. It also has two major components:</p><h3><strong>1. Attractors Can Change:</strong></h3><p><strong>IMAGE: </strong><a href=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*swdNdqeWG0WjhmQDLbOUxg.png""><strong>https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*swdNdqeWG0WjhmQDLbOUxg.png</strong></a></p><p>Attractors affect one another. </p><p>Once you’re being pulled in by one, this actually modifies other Attractors. This usually manifests by changing how strongly other ones are pulling you in. Sometimes, though, this even means that some Attractors will disappear, and new ones may appear.</p><p>This basically means that taking actions can affect how you feel about other actions.</p><p>For example, the set of things that feel desirable to me after running a marathon (EX: drinking water) may differ greatly from the set of things after I read a book on governmental corruption (EX: starting a socialist revolution). </p><p>Upon reflection, this seems fairly obvious. Humans aren’t closed systems—our preferences are <em>always</em> changing with our internal and external states. </p><p>Transfer is always happening. Think about how we react when someone says something nasty or as the weather changes. Our emotions leak into our actions in the real world, and real world events affect our emotions. </p><p>My point here is that, from a perception-based point-of-view, it <em>feels</em> like our actions change the sorts of things we might want. </p><p>Every time we take an action, then, this will, in turn, prime how we view other actions, often in predictable ways. Though we might not know exactly how they’ll change, we can get good, rough ideas from past experience and our imaginations.</p><p>We’ll be capitalizing on this interaction later on when we start exploring further consequences of the Attractor Theory model.</p><p></p><h3><strong>2. Direct Path ≠ Optimal Path</strong></h3><p><strong>IMAGE: </strong><a href=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*kRpwNx8NvlzTj0sjC4VJ9Q.png""><strong>https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*kRpwNx8NvlzTj0sjC4VJ9Q.png</strong></a></p><p>As a human, your goal is to navigate this tangle of Utilons and Attractors from your hamster ball, trying to collect Utilons.</p><p>Now you <em>could</em> just try to take a direct path to all the nearest Utilons. However, that would also mean exerting a lot of energy to fight the pull of Attractors that pull you in Utilon-sparse directions.</p><p>Instead, given that you can’t avoid Attractors (they’re everywhere in the environment!), the best thing to do is to be strategic:</p><p>What I mean by that is you want to think about how “launch” yourself around in the environment. Attractors might pull you in, but you still have some limited control when it comes to choosing which ones to dive into and which ones to pop out of.</p><p>You want to choose which Attractors you’re drawn to and <em>selectively</em> choose when to exert energy to move from one to another to maximize your overall trajectory (more on the energy exertion next section).</p><p>The Global Optimization view is also a lot more forgiving to taking breaks. Once you take the view that long-term maximization is the goal, you’re less likely to beat yourself up for taking rests.</p><p>This is because, in many cases, the break isn’t cutting time away from your “potential work time”, but it’s actually essential to maintaining your ability to even do work in the first place.</p><p>For example, taking short breaks is a key component of the Pomodoro Method that ensures you don’t burn out. Likewise, taking periodic walks or other activities which give you time for your attention to wander often allow your mind to do deeper thinking.</p><p>And of course sleeping is fairly necessary for optimal functionality.</p><p style=""text-align:center;"">++++</p><h2><strong>Properties:</strong></h2><p>Attractor Theory as a model contains several useful concepts: <strong>Meta-Effects</strong>, <strong>Auxiliary Actions</strong>, <strong>Starting / Stopping Costs</strong>, and <strong>Precommitment</strong>.</p><h3><strong>Meta-Effects:</strong></h3><p>When most people consider actions, I claim that they consider basically two things:</p><p><strong>1. The cost of the action.<br/></strong>EX: “How many hours will it take to drive to Los Angeles?”</p><p><strong>2. The effects of the action.<br/></strong>EX: “What are the benefits of going to Los Angeles?”</p><p>If you’re smart, you might also consider the tradeoffs and opportunity costs, by comparing the action to other choices.</p><p>With Attractor Theory, I think you also now consider a third very important property of the actions available to you:</p><p><strong>3. The effects of the action on </strong><em><strong>you</strong></em><strong>.<br/></strong>EX: “How will going to Los Angeles change the set of actions that feel yummy to me?”</p><p>It’s obvious, for sure, but I think that most people’s defaults either only have this as an implicit consideration. Otherwise, they actually just don’t really think it about it all.</p><p style=""text-align:center;"">++++</p><h3><strong>Auxiliary Actions:</strong></h3><p>Attractor Theory really shines when you start seeing your actions in terms of, not just their direct effects, but also their effects on how you can take further actions. It changes your decision algorithm to be something like:</p><p><em>“Choose actions such that their meta-level effects on me by my taking them allow me to take more actions of this type in the future and maximize the number of Utilons I can earn in the long run.”</em></p><p>By phrasing it this way, it makes it more clear that most things in life are a longer-term endeavor that involve trying to globally optimize, rather than locally. </p><p>(While it’s arguable that a naive view of maximization should by default take this into account from a consequentialist lens, I think making it explicitly clear, as the above formulation does, is a useful distinction.)</p><p>This allows us to better evaluate actions which, by themselves, might not be too useful, but do a good job of reorienting ourselves into a better state of mind. </p><p>I think it ends up creating the class of <strong>auxiliary actions</strong>, actions which are easy to do and also make it easier to take other actions. You can sort of think of them as stepping stones, which bridge the state between where you are and where you want to end up.</p><p>For example, spending a few minutes outside to get some air might not be directly useful, but it’ll likely help clear my mind, which has good benefits down the line, in how I’m able to do work in the immediate future.</p><p>Other potential auxiliary actions for you might include drinking water, stretching, doodling, meditating, or going for a short walk.</p><p style=""text-align:center;"">++++</p><h3><strong>Starting / Stopping Costs:</strong></h3><p>Attractor Theory also does a good job of modeling how actions seem much harder to start than to stop. Moving from one Attractor to a disparate one can be costly in terms of energy, as you need to move against the pull of the current Attractor.</p><p>Once you’re pulled in, though, it’s usually easier to keep going with the flow. So using this model ascribes costs to starting, and it places a lower cost on continuing actions. By “pulled in”, I mean making it feel effortless or desirable to continue with the action. </p><p>(I’m thinking of the feeling you get when you have a decent album playing music, and you feel sort of tempted to switch it to a better album, except that, given that this good song is already playing, you don’t really feel like switching. Or something like that.)</p><p>This is where willpower comes in. Remember that rolling takes energy, and you probably only have a finite amount of it. Thus, you want to pick and choose when you apply willpower.</p><p>The Attractor Theory model suggests that the best opportunities to try “extra hard” are the ones where you predict that things will be smooth sailing once you’re pulled into the Attractor.</p><p>For example, if getting started on reading a book is difficult, but you know that you’ll likely find yourself engrossed in the book conditional on your starting, then this is a good place to put in willpower.</p><p>Keeping this in mind allows you to strategically go &quot;against the current&quot; in the situations where it&#x27;ll have the greatest benefit on the immediate Future You&#x27;s ability to do continued work.</p><p style=""text-align:center;"">++++</p><h3><strong>Precommitment:</strong></h3><p>Attractor Theory views <em>all</em> actions and situations as self-reinforcing slippery slopes. </p><p>As such, it more realistically models the act of taking certain actions as leading you to other Attractors, so you’re not just looking at things in isolation.</p><p>This view allows you to better see certain “traps”, where an action will lead you deeper and deeper down an addiction/reward cycle, like a huge bag of chips or a webcomic. </p><p>These are situations where, after the initial buy-in, it becomes incredibly attractive to continue down the same path, as these actions make reinforce themselves, making it easy to continue on and on…</p><p>In this model, we can reasonably predict, for example, that any video on YouTube will likely lead to more videos because the “sucked-in-craving-more-videos Future You” will have different preferences than “needing-some-sort-of-break Present You”.</p><p>Our model better reveals how things like YouTube are being deceptive by tricking your brain with the promise of a small action (“I’ll watch <em>just one</em> video…”). </p><p>The reality is that watching YouTube is a <em>monstrously large Attractor</em>.</p><p><em>(“It’s so f***ing big!”)</em></p><p>The vast variety of suggested videos coupled with the inertia associated with switching actions means that it’s <em>never</em> actually just that one video. Once you’re down the rabbit hole, you just keep on going.</p><p>Under Attractor Theory, you’d want to avoid situations which you could lead you down dangerous spirals, even when the initial actions themselves may not be that distracting because the model more accurately penalizes this type of snowballing.</p><p style=""text-align:center;"">++++</p><h2><strong>Summary:</strong></h2><p>Attractor Theory tries to explain how we’re not always directly in control. Our actions appear to affect how we take other actions. Still, we <em>do</em> have willpower, and it’s best to try and strategically use energy when considering which decisions to make.</p><h2 style=""text-align:center;""><a href=""https://www.lesserwrong.com/posts/hLEo3NfoD8YoT3yfN/instrumental-rationality-7-closing-disclaimer""><strong>Next Essay</strong></a></h2></div></div></div></div></div></div>",,,,

<p>Response To (Eliezer Yudkowsky): <a href=""https://www.lesserwrong.com/posts/BEtzRE2M5m9YEAQpX/there-s-no-fire-alarm-for-artificial-general-intelligence"">There&#8217;s No Fire Alarm for Artificial General Intelligence</a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s long, but read the whole thing.  Eliezer makes classic Eliezer points in classic Eliezer style. Even if you mostly know this already, there&#8217;s new points and it&#8217;s worth a refresher. I fully endorse his central point, and most of his supporting arguments.</p>
<p>What Eliezer has rarely been, is fair. That&#8217;s part of what makes The Sequences work. I want to dive in where he says he&#8217;s going to be blunt &#8211; as if he&#8217;s ever not been &#8211; so you know it&#8217;s gonna be good:</p>
<blockquote><p>Okay, let’s be blunt here. I don’t think most of the discourse about AGI being far away (<em>or</em> that it’s near) is being generated by models of future progress in machine learning. I don’t think we’re looking at wrong models; I think we’re looking at no models.</p>
<p>I was once at a conference where there was a panel full of famous AI luminaries, and most of the luminaries were nodding and agreeing with each other that of course AGI was very far off, except for two famous AI luminaries who stayed quiet and let others take the microphone.</p>
<p>I got up in Q&amp;A and said, “Okay, you’ve all told us that progress won’t be all that fast. But let’s be more concrete and specific. I’d like to know what’s the <em>least</em> impressive accomplishment that you are very confident <em>cannot</em> be done in the next two years.”</p>
<p>There was a silence.</p>
<p>Eventually, two people on the panel ventured replies, spoken in a rather more tentative tone than they’d been using to pronounce that AGI was decades out. They named “A robot puts away the dishes from a dishwasher without breaking them”, and <a href=""http://www.cs.nyu.edu/faculty/davise/papers/WinogradSchemas/WS.html"">Winograd schemas</a>. Specifically, “I feel quite confident that the Winograd schemas—where we recently had a result that was in the 50, 60% range—in the next two years, we will not get 80, 90% on that regardless of the techniques people use.”</p>
<p>A few months after that panel, there was unexpectedly a big breakthrough on Winograd schemas. The breakthrough didn’t crack 80%, so three cheers for wide credibility intervals with error margin, but I expect the predictor might be feeling slightly more nervous now with one year left to go. (I don’t think it was the breakthrough I remember reading about, but Rob turned up <a href=""https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ijcai.org%2Fproceedings%2F2017%2F0326.pdf&amp;h=ATMiIliuWNyZbf0ezht51f12W7gL1Gw1AgwfGsF2MUCMMNa_sw9vB1iS6etZYPeiaJuKbxZR92VAbn7uJAZwUHkXm59JK0pBI4cB2ve9rKRpz0vKGXozkvegWE7gbiUWuoP8BwLo0_0mhpnIdbfiO9X9Dpw"">this paper</a> as an example of one that could have been submitted at most 44 days after the above conference and gets up to 70%.)</p>
<p>But that’s not the point. The point is the silence that fell after my question, and that eventually I only got two replies, spoken in tentative tones. When I asked for concrete feats that were impossible in the next two years, I think that that’s when the luminaries on that panel switched to trying to build a mental model of future progress in machine learning, asking themselves what they could or couldn’t predict, what they knew or didn’t know. And to their credit, most of them did know their profession well enough to realize that forecasting future boundaries around a rapidly moving field is actually <em>really hard</em>, that nobody knows what will appear on arXiv next month, and that they needed to put wide credibility intervals with very generous upper bounds on how much progress might take place twenty-four months’ worth of arXiv papers later.</p>
<p>(Also, Demis Hassabis was present, so they all knew that if they named something insufficiently impossible, Demis would have DeepMind go and do it.)</p>
<p>The question I asked was in a completely different genre from the panel discussion, requiring a mental context switch: the assembled luminaries actually had to try to consult their rough, scarce-formed intuitive models of progress in machine learning and figure out what future experiences, if any, their model of the field definitely prohibited within a two-year time horizon. Instead of, well, emitting socially desirable verbal behavior meant to kill that darned hype about AGI and get some predictable applause from the audience.</p>
<p>I’ll be blunt: I don’t think the confident long-termism has been thought out at all. If your model has the extraordinary power to say what will be impossible in ten years after another one hundred and twenty months of arXiv papers, then you ought to be able to say much weaker things that are impossible in two years, and you should have those predictions queued up and ready to go rather than falling into nervous silence after being asked.</p>
<p>In reality, the two-year problem is hard and the ten-year problem is laughably hard. The future is hard to predict in general, our predictive grasp on a rapidly changing and advancing field of science and engineering is very weak indeed, and it doesn’t permit narrow credible intervals on what can’t be done.</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree that most discourse around AGI is not based around models of machine learning. I agree the AI luminaries seem to not have given good reasons for their belief in AGI being far away.</p>
<p>I also think Eliezer&#8217;s take on their response is entirely unfair. Eliezer asks an excellent question, but the response is quite reasonable.</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>It is <em>entirely </em>unfair to expect a queued up answer.</p>
<p>Suppose I have a perfectly detailed mental model for future AI developments. If you ask, &#8220;What&#8217;s the chance ML can put away the dishes within two years?&#8221; I&#8217;ll need to do math, but: 3.74%.</p>
<p>Eliezer asks me his question.</p>
<p>Have I recently worked through that question? There are tons of questions. Questions about least impressive things in any reference class are rare. Let alone this particular class, confidence level and length of time.</p>
<p>So, no. Not queued up. The only reason to have this answer queued up is <em>if someone is going to ask. </em></p>
<p>I did not anticipate that. I certainly did not <em>in the context of a listening Dennis Hassabis. </em>This is quite the <a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/08/14/beware-isolated-demands-for-rigor/"">isolated demand for rigor</a><em>. </em>I&#8217;ll need to think.</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>Assume a mental model of AI development.</p>
<p>I am asked for the <em>least impressive </em>thing. To answer well, I must maximize.</p>
<p>What must be considered?</p>
<p>I need to decide what Eliezer meant by very confident, and what <em>other people </em>will think it means, and what they think Eliezer meant. Three different values. Very confident as actually used varies wildly. Sometimes it means 90% or less. Sometimes it means 99% or more. Eliezer later claims I should know what my model <em>definitely prohibits </em>but asked about <em>very confident</em>. There is danger of misinterpretation.</p>
<p>I need to decide what impressiveness means in context. Impressiveness in terms of currently perceived difficulty? In terms of the public or other researchers going &#8216;oh, cool&#8217;? Impressive for a child? Some mix? Presumably Eliezer means perceived difficulty but there is danger of willful misinterpretation.</p>
<p>I need to query my model slash brainstorm for unimpressive things I am very confident cannot be done in two years. I adjust for the Hassabis effect that tasks I name will be accomplished faster.</p>
<p>I find the least impressive thing.</p>
<p>Finally I choose whether to answer.</p>
<p>This process isn&#8217;t fast <em>even with a full model of future AI progress.</em></p>
<p>III</p>
<p>I have my answer: &#8220;A robot puts away the dishes from a dishwasher without breaking them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Should I say it?</p>
<p>My upside is limited.</p>
<p>It won&#8217;t be the least impressive thing not done within two years. Plenty of less impressive things <em>might </em>be done within two years. Some will and some won&#8217;t. My answer will seem lousy. The Hassabis effect compounds this, since some things that did not happen in two years <em>might have if I&#8217;d named them. </em></p>
<p>Did Eliezer&#8217;s essay accelerate work done on unloading a dishwasher? On the Winograd schemas?</p>
<p>If I say something that <em>doesn&#8217;t </em>happen but comes <em>close</em>, such as getting 80% on the Winograd schemas if we get to 78%, I look wrong and lucky. If it <em>doesn&#8217;t</em> come close, I look foolish.</p>
<p>Also, humans are terrible at calibration.</p>
<p>A true 98% confident answer looks <em>hopelessly </em>conservative to most people, and my off-the-cuff 98% confident answer likely isn&#8217;t 98% reliable.</p>
<p>Whatever I name might happen. How embarrassing! People will laugh, distrust and panic. My reputation suffers.</p>
<p>The answer Eliezer gets might be important. If I don&#8217;t want laughter, distrust or panic, it might be bad if <em>even one </em>answer given happens within two years.</p>
<p>In exchange, Eliezer sees a greater willingness to answer, and I transfer intuition. Does that seem worth it?</p>
<p>IV</p>
<p>Eliezer asked his question. What happened?</p>
<p>The room fell silent. Multiple luminaries <em>stopped to think</em><em>. </em>That seems excellent. Positive reinforcement!</p>
<p>Two gave tentative answers. Those answers seemed honest, reasonable and interesting. The question was <em>hard. </em>They were on the spot. Tentativeness was the opposite of a <a href=""http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2016/01/the_invisible_t.html"">missing mood</a>. It properly expresses low confidence. Positive reinforcement!</p>
<p>Others chose not to answer. Under the circumstances, I sympathize.</p>
<p>These actions do not seem like strong evidence of a lack of models, or of bad faith. This seems like what you hope to see.</p>
<p>V</p>
<p>I endorse Eliezer&#8217;s central points. There will be no fire alarm. We won&#8217;t have a clear sign AGI is coming soon until AGI arrives. We need to act <em>now. </em>It&#8217;s an emergency <em>now. </em>Public discussion is mostly not based on models of AI progress or concrete short term predictions.</p>
<p>Most discussions of the future are not built around concrete models of the future. It is unsurprising that AI discussions follow this pattern.</p>
<p>One can still challenge that one needs short-term predictions about AI progress to make long-term predictions. It is <em>not obvious</em> long-term prediction is <em>harder</em>, or that it <em>depends upon </em>short-term predictions. AGI might come purely from incremental machine learning progress. It might require major insights. It might not come from machine learning.</p>
<p>There are many ways to then conclude that AGI is far away where far away means decades out. Not that decades out is all that far away. <em>Eliezer conflating the two should freak you out. </em>AGI reliably forty years away would be quite the fire alarm.</p>
<p>You could think there isn&#8217;t much machine learning progress, or that progress is nearing its limits. You could think that progress will slow dramatically, perhaps because problems will get exponentially harder.</p>
<p>You might think problems will get exponentially harder and resources spent will get exponentially larger too, so estimates of future progress move mostly insofar as they move the expected growth rate of future invested resources.</p>
<p>You could think incentive gradients from building more profitable or higher scoring AIs won&#8217;t lead to AGIs, even if other machine learning paths might work. <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/80000-hours/dario-amodei-on-openai-and-how-ai-will-change-the-world-for-good-and-ill-july-07"">Dario Amodei says OpenAI is &#8220;following the gradient.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>You could believe our civilization incapable of effort that does not follow incentive gradients.</p>
<p>You might think that our civilization will collapse or cease to do such research before it gets to AGI.</p>
<p>You could think building an AGI would require doing a thing, and our civilization is no longer capable of doing things.</p>
<p>You could think that there is a lot of machine learning progress to be made between here and AGI, such that even upper bounds on current progress leave decades to go.</p>
<p>You could think that even a lot of the right machine learning progress won&#8217;t lead to AGI at all. <a href=""https://srconstantin.wordpress.com/2017/10/10/distinctions-in-types-of-thought/"">Perhaps it is an entirely different type of thought</a>. Perhaps it does not qualify as thought at all. We find more and more practical tasks that AIs can do with machine learning, but one can think both &#8216;there are a lot of tasks machine learning will learn to do&#8217; and &#8216;machine learning  in anything like its current form cannot, even fully developed, do all tasks needed for AGI.&#8217;</p>
<p>And so on.</p>
<p>Most of those don&#8217;t predict much about the next two years, other than a non-binding upper bound. With these models, when machine learning does a new thing, that teaches us more about that problem&#8217;s difficulty than about how fast machine learning is advancing.</p>
<p>Under these models, Go and Heads Up No-Limit Hold &#8216;Em Poker are easier problems than we expected. We should update in favor of well-defined adversarial problems with compact state expressions but large branch trees being easier to solve. That doesn&#8217;t mean we shouldn&#8217;t update our progress estimates at all, but perhaps we shouldn&#8217;t update much.</p>
<p>This goes with everything AI learns to do ceasing to be AI.</p>
<p>Thus, one can reasonably have a model where impressiveness of short-term advances does not much move our AGI timelines.</p>
<p>I saw an excellent <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/o6p/double_crux_a_strategy_for_resolving_disagreement/"">double crux</a> on AI timelines, good enough to update me dramatically on the value of double crux and greatly enrich my model of AI timelines. Two smart, highly invested people had given the problem a lot of thought, and were doing their best to build models and assign probabilities and seek truth. Many questions came up. Short-term concrete predictions did not come up. At all.</p>
<p>VI</p>
<p>That does <em>not </em>mean any of that is what is happening.</p>
<p>I think mostly what Eliezer thinks is happening, is happening. People&#8217;s incentive gradients on short term questions say not to answer. People&#8217;s incentive gradients on long term questions say to have AGI be decades out. That&#8217;s mostly what they answer. Models might exist, but why let them change your answer? If you answer AGI is near and it doesn&#8217;t happen you look foolish. If you answer AGI is near and it happens, <em>who cares what you said? </em></p>
<p>When asked a question, good thinkers generate as much model as they need. Less good thinkers, or the otherwise motivated, instead model of what it is in their interest to say.</p>
<p>Most people who say productive AI safety work cannot currently be done have not spent two hours thinking about what could currently be done. Again, that&#8217;s true of all problems. Most people <em>never </em>spend two hours thinking about what could be done about <em>anything</em>.<em> </em>Ever. See Eliezer <a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Becoming_Stronger"">entire essential sequence (sequence Y).</a></p>
<p>That is how someone got so frustrated with getting people to actually think <em>about AI safety </em>that he decided it would be easier to get them to actually think <em>in general. </em></p>
<p>To do that, it&#8217;s important to be <em>totally unfair </em>to not thinking. Following incentive gradients and social queues and going around with inconsistent models and <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/ui/use_the_try_harder_luke/"">not trying things for even five minutes before declaring them impossible</a> won&#8217;t cut it and <em>that is totally not OK. </em></p>
<p>He emphasizes nature not grading on a curve, and <em>fails everyone. Hard.</em> The Way isn&#8217;t just A Thing, it&#8217;s a necessary thing.</p>
<p>Then we realize that no, it&#8217;s <em>way worse </em>than that. People are not only not following The Way. <a href=""http://kajsotala.fi/2017/09/nobody-does-the-thing-that-they-are-supposedly-doing/"">No one does the thing they are supposedly doing.</a> The world is mad on a different level than inaccurate models without proper Bayesian updating and not stopping to think or try for five minutes once in their life let alone two hours. There are no models anywhere.</p>
<p>Fairness can&#8217;t always be a thing. <a href=""https://www.lesserwrong.com/posts/HW2fbbGM8B6y7pkDb/the-just-world-hypothesis"">Trying to make it a thing where it isn&#8217;t a thing tends to go quite badly</a>.</p>
<p>Sometimes, though, you still need fairness. Without it groups can&#8217;t get along. Without it you can&#8217;t cooperate. Without it we treat thinking about a new and interesting question as evidence of a lack of thinking.</p>
<p>Holding everyone to heroic responsibility wins you few friends, influences few people and drives you insane.</p>
<p>VII</p>
<p>Where does that leave us? Besides the original takeaway that <a href=""https://www.lesserwrong.com/posts/BEtzRE2M5m9YEAQpX/there-s-no-fire-alarm-for-artificial-general-intelligence"">There Is No Fire Alarm For Artificial General Intelligence</a> and we need to work on the problem now? And your periodic reminder that people are crazy and the world is mad?</p>
<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microfoundations"">Microfoundations</a> are great, but some useful models don&#8217;t have them. It would be great if everyone had probabilistic time distributions for every possible event, but this is <em>totally not reasonable, </em>and <em>totally not required to have a valid opinion. </em>Some approaches answer some questions but not others.</p>
<p>We must hold onto our high standards for ourselves and those who opt into them. For others, we must think about circumstance and incentive, and stop at &#8216;tough, but fair.&#8217;</p>
<p>Predictions are valuable. They are hard to do well and socially expensive to do honestly. A culture of stating your probabilities upon request is good. <a href=""http://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/futarchy.pdf"">Betting on your beliefs</a> is better. Part of that is understanding not everyone has thought through everything. And understanding adverse selection and bad social odds. And realizing sometimes best guesses would get taken too seriously, or commit people to things. Sometimes people need to speak tentatively. Or say &#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221; Or say nothing.</p>
<p>Allies won&#8217;t always ponder what you&#8217;re pondering. They aren&#8217;t perfectly rigorous thinkers. They don&#8217;t think hard for two hours about your problem. They don&#8217;t often <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/uo/make_an_extraordinary_effort/"">make extraordinary efforts</a>.</p>
<p>Most of what they want will involve social reality and incentive gradients and muddled thinking. They&#8217;re doing it for the wrong reasons. They will often be unreliable and untrustworthy. They&#8217;re defecting <em>constantly.</em></p>
<p><a href=""http://crooksandliars.com/2006/12/15/remebering-rumsfeld-you-go-to-war-with-the-army-you-have-not-the-army-you-might-want-or-wish-to-have-at-a-later-time"">You go to war with the army you have</a>.</p>
<p>We can&#8217;t afford to hold everyone to impossible standards. Even holding <em>ourselves </em>to impossible standards requires psychologically safe ways to do that.</p>
<p>When someone genuinely thinks, and offers real answers, cheer that. Especially answers against interest. They do the best they can. From another perspective <em>they could obviously do so much more, </em>but one thing at a time.</p>
<p>Giving them the right social incentive gradient, even in a small way, matters a lot.</p>
<p>Someone is doing their best to break through the incentive gradients of social reality.</p>
<p>We can work with that.</p>

<p>By tribalism, I basically mean the phenomenon where arguments and actions are <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/gw/politics_is_the_mindkiller/"">primarily evaluated</a> based on who makes them and which group they seem to support, not anything else. E.g. if a group thinks that X is bad, then it&#8217;s often seen as outright immoral to make an argument which would imply that X isn&#8217;t quite as bad, or that some things which are classified as X would be more correctly classified as non-X instead. I don&#8217;t want to give any specific examples so as to not derail the discussion, but hopefully everyone can think of some; the article &#8220;<a href=""http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/09/can-democracy-survive-tribalism.html"">Can Democracy Survive Tribalism</a>&#8221; lists lot of them, picked from various sides of the political spectrum.</p>
<p>Joshua Greene (<a href=""https://www.edge.org/response-detail/27168"">among</a> <a href=""http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.840.3768&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf"">others</a>) makes the argument, in his book <a href=""https://smile.amazon.com/Moral-Tribes-Emotion-Reason-Between/dp/0143126059/"">Moral Tribes</a>, that tribalism exists for the purpose of coordinating aggression and alliances against other groups (so that you can kill them and take their stuff, basically). It specifically exists for the purpose of making you hurt others, as well as defend yourself against people who would hurt you. And while defending yourself against people who would hurt you is clearly good, attacking others is clearly not. And everything being viewed in tribal terms means that we can&#8217;t make much progress on things that actually matter: as someone commented, &#8220;people are fine with randomized controlled trials in policy, as long as the trials are on things that nobody cares about&#8221;.</p>
<p>Given how deep tribalism sits in the human psyche, it seems unlikely that we&#8217;ll be getting rid of it anytime soon. That said, there do seem to be a number of things that affect the <em>amount</em> of tribalism we have:</p>
<p>* As Steven Pinker argues in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Better_Angels_of_Our_Nature"">The Better Angels of Our Nature</a>, violence in general has declined over historical time, replaced by more cooperation and an assumption of human rights; Democrats and Republicans may still hate each other, but they generally agree that they still shouldn&#8217;t be killing each other.<br />
* As a purely anecdotal observation, I seem to get the feeling that people on the autism spectrum tend to be less tribal, up to the point of not being able to perceive tribes at all. (this suggests, somewhat oddly, that the world would actually be a better place if everyone was slightly autistic)<br />
* Feelings of safety or threat seem to play a lot into feelings of tribalism: if you perceive (correctly or incorrectly) that a group Y is out to get you and that they are a real threat to you, then you will react much more aggressively to any claims that might be read as supporting Y. Conversely, if you feel safe and secure, then you are much less likely to feel the need to attack others.</p>
<p>The last point is especially troublesome, since it can give rise to self-fulfilling predictions. Say that Alice says something to Bob, and Bob misperceives this as an insult; Bob feels threatened so snaps at Alice, and now Alice feels threatened as well, so shouts back. The same kind of phenomenon seems to be going on a much larger scale: whenever someone perceives a threat, they are no longer willing to give someone the benefit of doubt, and would rather treat the other person as an enemy. (which isn&#8217;t too surprising, since it makes evolutionary sense: if someone <em>is</em> out to get you, then the cost of misclassifying them as a friend is much bigger than the cost of misclassifying a would-be friend as an enemy. you can always find new friends, but it only takes one person to get near you and hurt you really bad)</p>
<p>One implication might be that general mental health work, not only in the conventional sense of &#8220;healing disorders&#8221;, but also the positive psychology-style mental health work that actively seeks to make people happy rather than just fine, could be even more valuable for society than we&#8217;ve previously thought. Curing depression etc. would be enormously valuable even by itself, but if we could figure out how to make people generally happier and resilient to negative events, then fewer things would threaten their well-being and they would perceive fewer things as being threats, reducing tribalism.</p>",Kaj_Sotala,kaj_sotala,Kaj_Sotala,

This piece focused on futurists as social groups with different incentives, and didn’t really engage with the content of their arguments. Instead, she points out considerations like this:</p><blockquote><p>First up: the people who believe in the singularity and are not worried about it. […] These futurists are ready and willing to install hardware in their brains because, as they are mostly young or middle-age white men, they have never been oppressed.</p></blockquote><p>She doesn’t engage with the content of their arguments about the future. I used to find this sort of thing inexplicable and annoying. Now I just find it sad but reasonable.</p><p>O’Neil is operating under the assumption that the denotative content of the futurists’ arguments is not relevant, except insofar as it affects the <a href=""http://benjaminrosshoffman.com/actors-and-scribes-words-and-deeds/"">enactive content</a> of their speech. In other words, their ideology is part of a process of coalition formation, and taking it seriously is for suckers.</p><h1>AI and ad hominem</h1><p>Scott Alexander of Slate Star Codex recently <a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/10/09/in-favor-of-futurism-being-about-the-future/"">complained</a> about O’Neil’s writing:</p><blockquote><p>It purports to explain what we should think about the future, but never makes a real argument for it. It starts by suggesting there are two important axes on which futurists can differ: optimism vs. pessimism, and belief in a singularity. So you can end up with utopian singularitarians, dystopian singularitarians, utopian incrementalists, and dystopian incrementalists. We know the first three groups are wrong, because many of their members are “young or middle-age white men” who “have never been oppressed”. On the other hand, the last group contains “majority women, gay men, and people of color”. Therefore, the last group is right, there will be no singularity, and the future will be bad.</p><p>[…]</p><p>The author never even begins to give any argument about why the future will be good or bad, or why a singularity might or might not happen. I’m not sure she even realizes this is an option, or the sort of thing some people might think relevant.</p></blockquote><p>Scott doesn’t have a solution to the problem, but he’s taking the right first step - trying to create common knowledge about the problem, and calling for others to do the same:</p><blockquote><p>I wish ignoring this kind of thing was an option, but this is how our culture relates to things now. It seems important to mention that, to have it out in the open, so that people who turn out their noses at responding to this kind of thing don’t wake up one morning and find themselves boxed in. And if you’ve got to call out crappy non-reasoning sometime, then meh, this article seems as good an example as any.</p></blockquote><p>Scott’s interpretation seems basically accurate, as far as it goes. It’s true that O’Neil doesn’t engage with the content of futurists’ arguments. It’s true that this is a problem.</p><p>The thing is, perhaps she’s <em>right</em> not to engage with the content of futurists’ arguments. After all, as Scott <a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/12/17/should-ai-be-open/"">pointed out years ago</a> (and I <a href=""http://benjaminrosshoffman.com/openai-makes-humanity-less-safe/"">reiterated</a> more recently), when the single most prominent AI risk organization initially announced its mission, it was a mission that basically 100% of credible arguments about AI risk imply to be the exact wrong thing. If you had assumed that the content of futurists’ arguments about AI risk would be a good guide to the actions taken as a result, you would quite often be badly mistaken.</p><p>Of course, maybe you disbelieve the mission statement instead of the futurists’ arguments. Or maybe you believe both, but disbelieve the claim that OpenAI is working on AI risk relevant things. Anyhow you slice it, you have to dismiss <em>some</em> of the official communication as falsehood, by someone who is in a position to know better.</p><p>So, why is it so hard to talk about this?</p><h1>World of actors, world of scribes</h1><p>The immediately prior Slate Star Codex post, <a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/10/02/different-worlds/"">Different Worlds</a>, argued that if someone’s basic world view seems obviously wrong to you based on all of your personal experience, maybe their experience is really different. In another Slate Star codex post, titled <a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/12/12/might-people-on-the-internet-sometimes-lie/"">Might People on the Internet Sometimes Lie?</a>, Scott described how difficult he finds it to consider the hypothesis that someone is lying, despite strong reason to believe that lying is common.</p><p>Let&#x27;s combine these insights.</p><p>Scott lives in a world in which many people - the most interesting ones - are basically telling the truth. They care about the content of arguments, and are willing to make major life changes based on explicit reasoning. In short, he’s a member of the <a href=""http://benjaminrosshoffman.com/actors-and-scribes-words-and-deeds/"">scribe</a> caste. O’Neil lives in <a href=""http://benjaminrosshoffman.com/actors-and-scribes-words-and-deeds/"">actor</a>-world, in which words are primarily used as <a href=""http://benjaminrosshoffman.com/admonition/"">commands</a>, or coalition-building narratives.</p><p>If Scott thinks that paying attention to the contents of arguments is a good epistemic strategy, and the writer he’s complaining about thinks that it’s a bad strategy, this suggests an opportunity for people like Scott to make inferences about what other people’s very different life experiences are like. (I worked through an example of this myself in my <a href=""http://benjaminrosshoffman.com/locker-room-talk/"">post about locker room talk</a>.)</p><p>It now seems to me like the experience of the vast majority of people in our society is that when someone is making abstract arguments, they are more likely to be playing coalitional politics, than trying to transmit information about the structure of the world.</p><h1>Clever arguers</h1><p>For this reason, I noted with interest the implications of an exchange in the comments to Jessica Taylor’s recent Agent Foundations post on <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1628"">autopoietic systems and AI alignment</a>. Paul Christiano and Wei Dai considered the implications of clever arguers, who might be able to make superhumanly persuasive arguments for arbitrary points of view, such that a secure internet browser might refuse to display arguments from untrusted sources without proper screening.</p><p>Wei Dai <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1636"">writes</a>:</p><blockquote><p>I’m envisioning that in the future there will also be systems where you can input any conclusion that you want to argue (including moral conclusions) and the target audience, and the system will give you the most convincing arguments for it. At that point people won’t be able to participate in any online (or offline for that matter) discussions without risking their object-level values being hijacked.</p></blockquote><p>Christiano responds:</p><blockquote><p>It seems quite plausible that we’ll live to see a world where it’s considered dicey for your browser to uncritically display sentences written by an untrusted party.</p></blockquote><p>What if most people already live in that world? A world in which taking arguments at face value is not a capacity-enhancing tool, but a security vulnerability? Without trusted filters, would they not dismiss highfalutin arguments out of hand, and focus on whether the person making the argument seems friendly, or unfriendly, using hard to fake group-affiliation signals? This bears a substantial resemblance to the behavior Scott was complaining about. As he paraphrases:</p><blockquote><p>We know the first three groups are wrong, because many of their members are “young or middle-age white men” who “have never been oppressed”. On the other hand, the last group contains “majority women, gay men, and people of color”. Therefore, the last group is right, there will be no singularity, and the future will be bad.</p></blockquote><p>Translated properly, this simply means, “There are four possible beliefs to hold on this subject. The first three are held by parties we have reason to distrust, but the fourth is held by members of our coalition. Therefore, we should incorporate the ideology of the fourth group into our narrative.”</p><p>This is admirably disjunctive reasoning. It is also really, really sad. It is almost a fully general defense against discourse. It’s also not something I expect we can improve by browbeating people, or sneering at them for not understanding how arguments work. The sad fact is that people wouldn’t have these defenses up if it didn’t make sense to them to do so.</p><p>When I read Scott&#x27;s complaints, I was persuaded that O&#x27;Neil was fundamentally confused. But then I clicked through to her piece, I was shocked at how good it was. (To be fair, Scott did a very good job lowering my expectations.) She explains her focus quite explicitly:</p><blockquote><p>And although it can be fun to mock them for their silly sounding and overtly religious predictions, we should take futurists seriously. Because at the heart of the futurism movement lies money, influence, political power, and access to the algorithms that increasingly rule our private, political, and professional lives.</p><p>Google, IBM, Ford, and the Department of Defense all employ futurists. And I am myself a futurist. But I have noticed deep divisions and disagreements within the field, which has led me, below, to chart the four basic “types” of futurists. My hope is that by better understanding the motivations and backgrounds of the people involved—however unscientifically—we can better prepare ourselves for the upcoming political struggle over whose narrative of the future we should fight for: tech oligarchs that want to own flying cars and live forever, or gig economy workers that want to someday have affordable health care.</p></blockquote><p>I agree with Scott that the content of futurists&#x27; arguments matters, and that it has to be okay to engage with that <em>somewhere</em>. But it <em>also</em> has to be okay to engage with the social context of futurists&#x27; arguments, and an article that specifically tells you it&#x27;s about that seems like the most prosocial and scribe-friendly possible way to engage in that sort of discussion. If we&#x27;re going to whine about that, then in effect we&#x27;re just asking people to shut up and pretend that futurist narratives <em>aren&#x27;t</em> being used as shibboleths to build coalitions. That&#x27;s dishonest.</p><p>Most people in traditional scribe rolls are not proper scribes, but a fancy sort of standard-bearer. If we respond to people displaying the <em>appropriate amount of distrust</em> by taking offense - if we insist that they spend time listening to our arguments simply because we’re scribes - then we’re collaborating with the deception. If we really are more trustworthy, we should be able to send costly signals to that effect.

I expect it is common (because it happened to me and I have heard references to similar episodes by others) that such causes seem so important that aspiring rationalists set unreasonably high standards of dedication for themselves.</p><p>I think the concept of giving an extraordinary effort is a very important one, your brain wants to be lazy and if you are trying to do something challenging that you think is vitally important you want to push yourself to actually work hard, rather than merely “work hard”. A significant portion of this effort is exploring how to make raw effort more effective, but I what I want to address with this essay is how rest factors into attempting an extraordinary effort.</p><p>There is a certain kind of person who really needs to be warned that making an extraordinary effort does not mean one should try to work well past the point of exhaustion all the time. Part of giving an extraordinary effort is listening to your body, learning what you can do short of exhaustion, and maintaining that over time. Trying as hard as you possibly can until you burn out from overwhelming exhaustion is a merely desperate effort, and while it may be better than no effort at all, one can do much better by thinking in longer strategic terms.</p><p>It is easy to imagine an unattainably high standard of dedication you ought to have to your cause (it is so high because solving the problem is so tremendously important—there is little room for unimportant considerations like comfort). An ideal agent probably would work that much. However, it is critical to remember that we are humans rather than ideal agents. That usually means we cannot consistently do as much work as the most important problems seem to deserve. If we try, our brains will slowly give us worse and worse performances.</p><p>To someone who thinks they ought to be working that hard, this exhaustion is very distressing. They may not think to stop and revaluate, but believe the virtuous path is to continue striving onward through exhaustion. They have entered what I like to call a Humanistic Fervor. They have found a really important cause which they are wonderfully excited about working on it and they will do so will an unhealthy zeal. This approach, of forcing willpower to battle exhaustion, will eventually fail, leaving the person who attempted it feeling miserable about the experience.</p><p>After one’s efforts end in such a manner, those who have a developed habits and skills of self-reflection will then ask, “Okay, that was a disaster. What went wrong and how can I still work on this important thing without going through that again?”</p><p>That sort of question would be the proper way to begin to address the event, I think. Myself, I did not do that. I began to have thoughts along the lines of “Maybe I’m just not the right sort of person to solve this problem. If I was, surely I would have the passion and the ability to work that hard, wouldn’t I?”</p><p>And then, although I still thought my cause was important I stopped doing much work on it outside of what I had to. I managed not to think about the reasons I had for wanting to work so hard in the first place because my mind was protecting me from going through another event of Humanistic Fervor. It took me an embarrassingly long time to think, “Huh, that’s still important. And the level of work I’m doing now is clearly pathetic compared to what I could reasonably do. So how can I give an actual effort without making myself miserable?”</p><p>That requires listening to your body. When you’re exhausted you stop. When your brain is at the point that words are sliding through it with barely a hint of comprehension, that is not a good time to grit your teeth and force yourself to continue onwards. At least not usually. Such pushes should be reserved for rare, unusually desperate occasions. I am not describing the same thing as your mind feeling a little tired and stopping. Your brain wants to be lazy all the time. You have to test what it can really do. If you planned to work and you feel a bit tired, stat working and if after using all your normal tricks to get your brain moving it still feels like mush, well maybe it’s time to call it for the day, or at least a few hours.</p><p>Be kind to yourself. Listen to your body. Sometimes it is merely lazy and sometimes it is truly exhausted. Learning to tell the difference is one of the keys to attempting a truly extraordinary effort. It is far from all you need, but I have found it to be necessary.</p><p></p></div></div></div></div>",Rossin,rossin,Rossin,

The amount of money isn&#x27;t very consequential to my overall budget. I can just save a little more in other ways and I&#x27;ll meet my target.&quot; The wise person reasons as follows: &quot;If I make this purchase now, I will similarly allow myself to make exceptions to my money-saving rule later, until the exception becomes the rule and I spend all my money. So, even though the amount of money here isn&#x27;t so large, I prefer to follow a general policy of saving, which implies saving in this particular case.&quot; A very wise person may reason a bit more cleverly: &quot;I can make impulse purchases if they pass a high bar, such that I actually only let a few dollars of unplanned spending past the bar every week on average. How rare is it that a purchase opportunity costing this much is at least this appealing?&quot; **does a quick check and usually doesn&#x27;t buy the thing, but sometimes does, when it is worth it** &gt;&gt;</p><p>The above is a rough outline for one set of moves you can make, but there are ways you can enhance the decision process even further.</p><p>One way you can generally increase your &quot;wisdom&quot; is to notice what specific environmental cues are /relevant/ to WHY the impulse occurred in the first place. I think these cues are initially not obvious, at least in my experience.</p><p>To illustrate, say I walk into a random store.</p><p>What factors determine the likelihood that I&#x27;m going to want to impulsively buy a thing?</p><p>There are times when I walk into a store without a plan, and I can be confident I&#x27;m going to walk out of it without having purchased anything.

(This will hopefully have the effect of you checking in with your current state, taking inventory / capturing all the variables in that moment. With those variables—even before walking through the store further or considering a decision—you should be able to predict the outcome. That is my claim anyway.)</p><p>In most situations, my own behavior shouldn&#x27;t surprise me. I have most of the relevant information about what my behavior will be. Humans are mostly just TAP machines.

For example, if you write down a plan with explicit contingencies for things going wrong and time estimates for each step, or write down a careful argument for your point of view, or solve some equations. The <em>outside view</em> refers to what &quot;an independent observer&quot; might think; the proverbial man-on-the-street; a perspective which doesn&#x27;t pay attention to all the details of the situation, but <a href=""https://www.lesserwrong.com/posts/GEZzHQLQETHW9vBER/placing-yourself-as-an-instance-of-a-class"">places it as an instance of a class</a>. For a plan, you have some outside-view probability that it will fail or take longer than you expect, based on <em>unforeseen</em> complications rather than explicitly-listed contingencies. For an argument, although the argument may conclude a belief with some high probability, your outside-view probability should usually be lower to account for your uncertainty that the argument is correct. For the equations, the outside view accounts for the probability that you&#x27;ve made a mathematical error.</p><p>One way of thinking about inside view vs outside view is that they are human-friendly ways of thinking about the likelihood function and the prior. Somehow, humans are frequently tempted to commit base-rate neglect: the belief in a hypothesis is just the extent to which it matches the data. For example, if <a href=""http://yudkowsky.net/rational/bayes"">a test for a rare disease comes up positive</a>. People are not inclined by default to multiply the evidence for something by the prior odds against, except in everyday circumstances which they&#x27;ve experienced a lot. (I think this mistake may also account for the conjunction fallacy.) &quot;Outside view&quot; helps you imagine base rates by envisioning a perspective with more distance from the issue. So, you come up with an inside view and an outside view and &quot;multiply them together&quot; to become a proper Bayesian. This gets rid of base-rate neglect, and related biases such as the availability heuristic (where you implicitly use &quot;number of times I&#x27;ve heard about this&quot; or similar things as a substitute for base-rates).</p><p>However, I think this underestimates the usefulness of outside view. Robin Hanson discusses it almost as if it is <a href=""http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/07/beware-the-insi.html"">equivalent to eliminating bias</a>. While I do think a strong outside view needs to be combined with a strong inside view, I think there&#x27;s a sense in which outside view is the first thing you reach for to debias almost anything, not just base-rate neglect.</p><p>Say you learn about a new bias, such as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omission_bias"">omission bias</a>, and you don&#x27;t have any special debiasing tools for it. What you do is you file it away under your list of important biases. Then, when you encounter a situation which pattern-matches to the bias, you think something like &quot;Ahh, but omission bias!&quot; and attempt to adjust for it.</p><p>In other words, you have some kind of quick pattern-matcher which looks out for signs of the bias. When it fires, you may do a more thorough check: are you in the kind of situation where the bias occurs? If so, you attempt to correct for the bias. This is outside-view reasoning; you are noticing that the situation has the general flavor of one which gives rise to bias, and attempting to follow the general policy which would correct for that bias, rather than the biased policy which you would follow by default.</p><p>If all goes well, jumping to outside view helps you subsequently develop more targeted debiasing strategies which hit the bias directly, including an inside view which doesn&#x27;t produce the bias in the first place. However, I want to give outside view credit for being the quick skill that you apply all over the place which helps to generate the further skills.</p></div></div></div></div>",abramdemski,abramdemski,abramdemski,

Maybe this is why the comments on my blog tend to be so consistently good.</p><p>Recently, a friend was telling me about the marketing strategy for a project of theirs. They favored growth, in a way that I was worried would destroy value. I struggled to articulate my threat model, until I hit upon the metaphor of that old haunter of my dreamscape, the anglerfish.</p><p>I am sure that something like the general process I&#x27;m describing is common and important. I am not sure at all of the details, but I am going to try to state this strongly and vividly, with little hedging, for the sake of clarity.</p><h1>The Anglerfish</h1><p>The anglerfish lives in waters too far beneath the surface of the sea for sunlight to reach. It dangles a luminescent lure in front of itself. This resembles a fishing angle, whence comes its name. This lure attracts animals of the deep sea, which approach the anglerfish, and are consequently eaten by it.</p><p>Why - in the deep sea where no sunlight can reach - would evolution favor animals that are attracted to light? I do not know exactly what strategy the Anglerfish&#x27;s prey are following, but we do know some general things about why an animal might be attracted to light.</p><p>The secondary uses of such a strategy are clear enough. Once some deep-sea-dwellers emit light, larger animals that predate on them might do better if attracted to light sources. But that presupposes the existence of other animals that already emit light, for other reasons.</p><p>What are the primary uses of light? In a region where no other creatures emit light, here are some reasons why would might begin to do so:</p><ul><li>To illuminate potential prey.</li><li>As a ward, to warn potential competitors that one is prepared to defend territory.</li><li>To attract complementary animals, either as symbiotes, or as mates.</li></ul><p>In all these cases, the purpose of the light is to <em>reveal information</em>. In all but the first case, it is to <em>share information with others, in order to enable cooperation. </em>Perhaps the purest version of this is the mating display. We can see this in the firefly, which uses its distinctive patterns of luminescent flashes to find mates.</p><p>The firefly has some information. It activates a beacon, in order to find someone with <em>complementary information</em>, in order to engage in <em>productive exchange</em>. Likewise for deep-sea fish who mate or find symbiotes by means of a light display.</p><p>Some fireflies mimic the mating flashes of other fireflies, in order to attract them, not for exchange of genetic information, but <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/30/science/30firefly.html"">in order to extract calories</a>.</p><p>The predation strategy of the anglerfish, properly generalized is a strategy that predates on all information-seeking behavior, whether competitive or cooperative. The anglerfish does not need to know that the animal that just swam in front of it is evaluating its mating display and finds it wanting, or is looking for a very different creature as a symbiote. So long as there are animals seeking illumination, the anglerfish only cares that some calories and raw materials have been brought within reach of a single burst of swimming and the clamping shut of its great maw.</p><p>Typically, a predator has to be more sophisticated than the creatures on which it preys. But the anglerfish follows a simple, information-poor strategy, that preys on sophisticated, information-rich ones. It doesn’t have to be a particularly skilled mimic - it simply preys on the fact that creatures seeking information will move towards beacons.</p><h1>Subcultures as ecosystems</h1><p>In David Chapman’s<a href=""https://meaningness.com/geeks-mops-sociopaths""> geeks, MOPs, and sociopaths</a>, “geeks” are the originators of subcultures. They are persons of refined taste and discernment. They found subcultures by discovering or creating something they believe to be of intrinsic value. The originators of this information share it with others, and the first to respond enthusiastically will be other geeks, who can tell that the content of the message is valuable.</p><p>Eventually, enough geeks congregate together, and the thing they are creating together becomes valuable enough, that people without the power to independently discern the source of value can tell that value is being created. These Chapman calls “Members Of the Public”, or “MOP”s. Geeks map roughly onto <a href=""https://aellagirl.com/2017/05/02/internet-communities-otters-vs-possums/"">Aellagirl&amp;#x27;s</a> possums, MOPs onto otters.</p><p>In the right ratios, MOPs and Geeks are symbiotes. The MOPs enjoy the benefits of the thing the geeks created, and are generally happy to share their social capital, including money, with the geeks.</p><p>But from another perspective MOPs are an exploitable resource, which the geeks have gathered in one place but are neither efficiently exploiting, nor effectively defending. This attracts people following a strategy of predating on such clusters of MOPs. These predators, whom Chapman names “sociopaths,” do not care about the idiosyncratic value the geeks are busy creating. What they do care about, is the generic resources - attention, money, volunteer hours, social proof - that the MOPs provide.</p><h2>Iterated improvement</h2><p>To summarize the above: Geeks build beacons. Initially these beacons are not very bright, but they are sending out high-information signals which attract other geeks looking for that information. Eventually, enough geeks are contributing to the beacons that they become bright enough to attract MOPs.</p><p>Chapman’s sociopaths can’t just waltz in and propose that everyone give them things for nothing. After all, everyone in their feeding ground was attracted to it by something about it, something that distinguishes it from other places in the culture. They need to look like a part of the scene. So they start by imitating, or proposing refinements to, the beacons the geeks have erected.</p><p>The geeks are only putting up a very particular kind of beacon. There are a lot of constraints on exactly what sort of signal they are willing to send. This is the same as saying that their beacons have a lot of information content. From the geeks’ perspective, the exchange of this information is the whole point of setting up beacons, and the presence of friendly MOPs is merely a happy side effect.</p><p>But from the sociopaths’ perspective, these information-bearing constraints are mere shibboleths. Chapman’s sociopaths will follow whatever rules they have to in order to pass as contributors to the subculture, but they won’t put independent effort into understanding why these rules are the ones they have to follow. Instead, their contribution is to <strong><em>iteratively improve the beacons’ ability to attract prey.</em></strong></p><p>As sociopaths test out variations in their beacons, they will learn which variants are best at attracting people, by means of trial and error. Three things about this will reduce the relative proportion of geeks in the subculture, and therefore the geeks’ influence. First, since MOPs are less sensitive to fine variations in signal than geeks are, random mutations in beacon design are more likely to attract more MOPs than more geeks. Second, as the overall process becomes better at attracting MOPs, more sociopaths will notice that it is a promising feeding ground.</p><p>Finally, many changes that are neutral or beneficial for attracting MOPs, will, from the geeks’ perspective, seem like the introduction of errors. This will make the signal less attractive to geeks who have not already invested in the subculture.</p><p>What does this process look like from the geeks’ perspective?</p><p>At first - people are coming into the geeks’ subculture, and trying to contribute to it. These newcomers are putting a lot of energy into creating new content, but from time to time introduce perplexing errors. But, they are getting a lot of people interested in this wonderful information you’ve created, so the geeks are not inclined to complain. The MOPs basically trust the geeks’ implied endorsement, and accept the new contributors on the same footing as the old ones.</p><p>But now there are two forces at play affecting the content of the signals being sent. One is a force correcting errors - the geeks’ desire to preserve, transmit, and develop the original information-content of the signal. The other force introduces errors: the sociopaths’ desire to attract more MOPs. When the second force becomes stronger than the first, the sociopaths are now the dominant faction, and able to coordinate to suppress geek attempts to correct errors that make the message more popular.</p><p>At first, the MOPs’ acceptance of the sociopaths depended in part on the geeks’ tacit endorsement. But once a sufficiently powerful faction of sociopaths has been given social proof, they can wield the force of disendorsement against the geeks. The only meaningful constraint is that MOPs don’t like conflict, so the sociopaths will want to avoid escalating to a point where the conflict becomes overt.</p><p>From the sociopaths’ perspective, the geeks were inexplicably donating their time and energy to discovering a new signal to broadcast, that would attract a pool of MOPs to feed on. But the geeks were - again incomprehensibly - neither exploiting nor defending that resource. The sociopath strategy invests in <em>general</em> understanding of social dynamics, but does not need to understand the <em>specific content</em> of what the geeks are trying to do. The sociopath need only know that some attention, money, volunteer hours, and social proof have been brought within reach of a competent marketing and sales effort.</p><p>From the sociopaths&#x27; perspective, they are not introducing errors - they are correcting them.</p><p>The paradigmatic predator is sufficiently smarter than its targets to anticipate and manipulate their behavior. But Chapman’s sociopaths follow a simple, information-poor strategy, that preys on sophisticated, information-rich ones. This strategy doesn’t have to understand the signal as well as the geeks do - the geeks will <a href=""http://benjaminrosshoffman.com/guess-culture-screens-for-trying-to-cooperate/"">help it pass their tests</a>. It simply iterates empirically towards shining the most attractive beacon it can, of a kind that has already been selected to attract its prey.</p><p>The predation strategy of Chapman’s sociopath is a strategy that predates on all information-seeking behavior, whether competitive or cooperative.</p><h1>What is to be done?</h1><p>I&#x27;ve used Chapman&#x27;s terms because they&#x27;re reasonably widely used jargon - Chapman borrowed the term &quot;sociopath&quot; from Venkatesh Rao&#x27;s quite dysphemistic <a href=""https://www.ribbonfarm.com/the-gervais-principle/"">Gervais Principle series</a> - but it&#x27;s important to remember that on this model, sociopaths are not necessarily universally bad or mean people. They just <em>don&#x27;t care about your project</em>. This is fine. You don&#x27;t care about most people&#x27;s projects. Likewise, most people don&#x27;t care about yours. The problem is when you let those people run your project.</p><p>Humanity has a long tradition of exploiting the information-exchange strategies of other creatures for our own use. I&#x27;m writing this from the house of a friend who has chickens in her backyard. The chickens want to lay eggs in order to make more chickens - but to my friend, the eggs are just food.</p><p><a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/09/23/out-to-get-you/"">Nor is it always bad to be food</a> to this sort of strategy. To a publicly traded corporation like Starbucks, I am little but a source of revenue and reputation (which ultimately matters because it attracts more revenue sources). This is fine, because I just want my coffee. I am not extending trust for Starbucks to have my best interests at heart.</p><p>As far as Chapman&#x27;s sociopaths know, they are just doing what one does to beacons - trying to make them more pleasing to more people. They are cooperating with the geeks as sincerely as they know how - as sincerely as the believe to be possible. In many cases they simply don’t understand that the original signal had value. There&#x27;s little point in being indignant about this. Just don&#x27;t put them in charge.</p><p>Likewise, the term MOP comes with a little more sneering than I think is appropriate. In general, if you are contemptuous of people for trusting you, something is going wrong.</p><p>Nor is indignation the right response to people who showed up and tried to participate in good faith. MOPs are more or less defined by not knowing what is going on <em>with respect to your subculture</em>, and while in some sense they might be culpable for that, they are the vast majority of human beings - the <em>members of the</em> <em>public</em> - and that is simply not a reasonable intervention point to target. It&#x27;s hard to know what&#x27;s going on. If it weren&#x27;t, the world would look very different.</p><p>No, the people who need to do something about the corruption of a message are the people who <em>care the most about that message</em>: the geeks. In subcultures following this lifecycle, <em><strong>geeks have committed a key sin: trying to get something for nothing, by pretending to be more popular than we are.</strong></em></p><p>People playing sociopath strategies gain a foothold in subcultures, because they <em>bring in more resources</em>, get more people involved, get attention from respectable people, raise money - since they are paying attention to how attractive their beacons are, not whether they are <em>correct</em> (from a geek perspective).</p><p>The obvious strategy to counter this is to speak up early and often when errors are being introduced. It is not a sin to be error-tolerant, in the sense of not immediately expelling people for making errors. But it is <em>always</em> a sin, in an otherwise-cooperative community, to <em>suppress the calling-out of errors</em>, in order to avoid making a scene, scaring off the MOPs, harming morale and momentum. If you are a geek in that sort of subculture, the MOPs are relying on your implied endorsement of the other content-creators. If you remain silent in the face of error, then you are <em>betraying this trust</em>. There is no additional error-correction system that will save you - you were supposed to be the error-correction system.</p><p>If you and your collaborators diligently follow this practice, then this will enable the creation of common knowledge when someone is reliably introducing errors, and either failing to correct them or making the minimum possible correction. You will have shared knowledge of track records - who is introducing information, and who is destroying it with noise. It is only with this knowledge that you can begin to have actual community standards.</p><p>This is why I’ve been so outspoken about<a href=""http://benjaminrosshoffman.com/effective-altruism-is-self-recommending/""> problems I see in Effective Altruism</a> - and plan to write on problems I see in the Rationality community. A few years ago, my relation to these things was something more like that of a MOP. I got excited about their ideas, trusted the people in charge to be doing what they said they were doing, and tried to reciprocate by bringing more resources like attention and money their way.</p><p>To their great credit, these overlapping communities were helpful in waking me up to my own sense of judgment and aesthetics. This helped me see what was going on a little more clearly.</p><p>I don’t have a working alternative up and running, but I feel a responsibility to speak up loudly and clearly enough that me three years ago would have <em>noticed that something smelled off</em>.</p><p>I have to do this - I owe it to anyone who trusts my tacit endorsement by association - or anyone who trusted my more overt endorsements in the past. And to myself; I care about the content, not the attractiveness of the beacon.</p><p>Finally, some advice for geeks, founders of subcultures, constructors of beacons. Make your beacon as dim as you can get away with while still transmitting the signal to those who need to see it. Attracting attention is a cost. It is not just a<a href=""http://benjaminrosshoffman.com/humble-charlie/""> cost to others</a>; it increases the overhead cost you pay, of defending this resource against predatory strategies. If you have more followers, attention, money, than you know how to use <em>right now</em> - then either your beacon budget is unnecessarily high, or you are already being eaten.</p><p>Don&#x27;t take more than you can use. Who hoards food, finds flies.</p><h1>On comment sections</h1><p>It&#x27;s puzzled me for a while, why my personal blog - which barely gets comments at all - gets comments of such a high typical quality. I&#x27;d imagined that to get really good comments, I&#x27;d have to put up with a lot of mediocre ones and some quite bad ones. But I don&#x27;t.</p><p>A lot of the writing advice I&#x27;ve received has been basically been telling me to manage the reader&#x27;s expectations. To deliver an entertainment experience. To tell a story, a narrative. I&#x27;ve found this prospect vaguely offensive, but haven&#x27;t had words for what about it seemed so bad.</p><p>But, when I look at the comment sections on more popular blogs, they are not consistently good.</p><p>I have cross-posted much of my writing to LessWrong. There, I get some readers <em>for free</em>, initially attracted by the lure of Eliezer Yudkowsky&#x27;s engagingly written sequences of blog posts on rationality, or the even more engagingly written Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality. This is valuable, but I don&#x27;t have the same experience I get on my own blog, where almost every comment that is not actually spam is one that I am very glad to have read.</p><p>This is true even when I&#x27;ve written on highly politicized topics, such as the sexual politics of the Trump election.</p><p>Part of why I don&#x27;t feel like making my writing like Eliezer Yudkowsky&#x27;s <a href=""https://www.lesserwrong.com/"">Sequences</a>, like Scott Alexander&#x27;s <a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/"">Slate Star Codex</a>, might be that I am reluctant to invite the kinds of low-quality engagement those writings get, mixed in with the high-quality stuff. Scott and Eliezer have had to ban people. I haven&#x27;t. I&#x27;d actually be happy if my readers <em>lowered</em> the quality and relevance threshold for commenting somewhat.</p><p>Of course, sometimes it&#x27;s worth trading off average quality for quantity. I might do so in the future - the badness of my writing is not entirely intentional. I&#x27;m not saying that Scott and Eliezer are wrong - just that my intuitions were correctly noticing a cost to doing things their way.</p><p>If I do make that trade, I&#x27;ll have to do more work such as moderating comments, to maintain the quality of what is right now a beautiful unwalled garden. But for now, no one here is just along for the entertaining ride - I don&#x27;t think anyone could get excited by my blog for the &quot;quality of the writing.&quot; If someone&#x27;s excited by one of my posts, it&#x27;s not because I leaned hard on their generic &quot;excitement&quot; buttons. It pretty much has to be because I explained well a thing they were puzzled by, or made an argument that they, in their own autonomous judgment, find relevant and interesting.</p><p>I&#x27;m not sending out the brightest beacon - just a beacon strong enough to send a high-fidelity signal.</p><hr class=""dividerBlock""/><p>* In the sense of very-low-quality automated advertising pretending to be personal communication, not in the sense of the foodstuff</p>",Benquo,benquo,Benquo,

Probably that they have poor taste  (in clothes, or subcultures). But it could also be that they are too poor to improve their wardrobe. Or can&#8217;t be bothered.</p>
<p>What about someone with poor grades? The obvious inference is that they aren&#8217;t so capable at the subject, but it may again be that they can&#8217;t be bothered, or that they have more urgent things to do with their time.</p>
<p>And someone who makes clever jokes? Probably that they are smart and naturally funny,  but if they had more time or effort to spend on this, it probably helped.</p>
<p>For all kinds of traits that people might try to signal with their behavior, someone can send a better signal if they have more money or time or self-control. Even when the main signal being sent is not usually thought to be about any of those things.</p>
<p>The reason this interests me: if signals often divide the population into &#8216;better or richer&#8217; vs. &#8216;worse or poorer&#8217;, I wonder if this would cause us to imagine that being rich is associated with being better, even if the two were entirely independent. (And similarly for wealth in other general-use resources, like self-control and time).</p>
<p>In a simple case, suppose there are just people with pretty clothes (who are both rich and have good taste) and people with ugly clothes (who either have bad taste, or lack resources or will). Then do observers come to think of &#8216;rich good taste&#8217; type and a &#8216;poor bad taste&#8217; type? Or do they pay more attention to the actual structure of the space, and know for instance that this doesn&#8217;t mean learning that someone really has bad taste actually means they are probably poorer.</p>

<p>Note that I&#8217;m not merely suggesting that a person with more wealth can send signals to look like they are better—that much is clear. I&#8217;m suggesting that at a population level, if the wealthier people can&#8217;t be distinguished from the better people on some axis, then observers may come to think that the two are associated in general, even if they are not at all.</p>
<p>If so, this would be important, because it would apply in a huge range of cases of signaling. So that the properties of poverty and weak-willedness and such would appear to us to be much worse than they really were.</p>",KatjaGrace,katjagrace,KatjaGrace,

The nomothetic fallacy</h2><p>Diagnosis isn&#x27;t a cure, but it can bring a sense of relief untethered from prognosis. You might still have the same symptoms that still need the same treatment, but it feels like a large part of the problem has been solved. This is, I&#x27;d argue, a decent chunk of why knowing about biases can hurt you. Don&#x27;t get complacent just because you have a name for something.</p><h2>2. Weaponized rationality</h2><p>Another big chunk of &quot;knowing about biases can hurt you&quot; comes from wielding concepts not in introspection but against others. (Like many of the considerations below, taking this as compelling is a general argument against much of the rationality project. But proliferating jargon, to my eye, makes most of the problems here relatively worse for external use as compared to internal use.)</p><h2>3. Being wrong</h2><p>Sometimes your analysis of the thing you&#x27;re trying to crystallize just isn&#x27;t very good. Your analogy doesn&#x27;t play out the way you think, the pattern doesn&#x27;t actually exist, you&#x27;re not carving reality at the joints, your framing could be better, it&#x27;s an inappropriate level of abstraction anywhere you&#x27;d actually want to use it. But, hey, the name stuck, so you can communicate all that in just a word!</p><h2>4. Lossy compression</h2><p>Maybe you got it right this time, but the name doesn&#x27;t capture everything. In practice, nobody&#x27;s going to remember your entire blog post every time someone utters the title. I hope you didn&#x27;t need that nuance. But at least this one went viral!</p><h2>5. Thinking on the page</h2><p>From Conor&#x27;s post:</p><blockquote><p>When you define a concept rigorously and clearly, you almost always learn new things from playing around with their edges and trying to get them to interface with other rigorous, clear concepts.</p></blockquote><p>And if you don&#x27;t define it rigorously and clearly—as is the case for pretty much everything happening here—if you play directly with the compressed concepts and string them together that way, oops, you just proved that 2+2=5. You lost track of the actual stuff the name referred to, the rules for manipulating it while preserving truth. You thought you were <a href=""https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/there%E2%80%99s-more-to-mathematics-than-rigour-and-proofs/"">post-rigor</a> when there isn&#x27;t even a rigorous stage. You were <a href=""https://www.lesserwrong.com/posts/3MjXPtimkhQf7kcWD/thinking-on-the-page"">thinking on the page</a>. [Oh, look, links to named chunked concepts. What are they doing here, of all places?]</p><p>Combining frameworks and making analogies between your concepts is a good way of generating new ideas, but it&#x27;s far from rigorous and if anything encourages sloppiness if you&#x27;re not careful to recognize that it&#x27;s less formal reasoning and more <a href=""https://www.lesserwrong.com/posts/NFZhLe4uCRcMCpvNR/exposition-and-guidance-by-analogy"">another way of pointing</a> to where the new things to learn might be.</p><h2>6. Illusion of transparency</h2><p>People will assume they know what you mean. You&#x27;ll assume you know what they mean in reply—that is, what a coincidence, that they know what you mean. They don&#x27;t.</p><h2>7. Lifting the pot by one handle</h2><h3>The trouble with rationalist skills is that the opposite of every rationalist skill is also a rationalist skill.</h3><blockquote><h4>–<a href=""https://squid314.livejournal.com/350090.html?thread=3817610#t3817610"">komponisto</a></h4></blockquote><p>In the comments to <a href=""http://squid314.livejournal.com/350090.html"">Epistemic Learned Helplessness</a> (now there&#x27;s a name, eh?), komponisto writes:</p><blockquote><p>We have the Inside View, and the Outside View. Overconfidence is a problem, but so is <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/c3/the_sin_of_underconfidence/"">underconfidence</a>. You&#x27;re supposed to listen to the <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/u7/that_tiny_note_of_discord/"">tiniest note of mental discord</a>, yet sometimes it&#x27;s necessary to <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/1j7/the_amanda_knox_test_how_an_hour_on_the_internet/"">shut loud mental voices out</a>. And while knowing the standard catalog of biases is obviously crucial for the aspiring rationalist, <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/he/knowing_about_biases_can_hurt_people/"">it can also hurt you</a>. Et cetera, et cetera.</p></blockquote><p>Is it <a href=""https://www.lesserwrong.com/posts/eqqbmvhApZiyggRLK/lotus-eating"">lotus eating</a> or self-care? Should you <a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/03/24/should-you-reverse-any-advice-you-hear/"">reverse any advice you hear</a> or not? Remembering a blogpost title isn&#x27;t going to tell you which situation you&#x27;re in; it&#x27;s at best a handle for noticing you&#x27;re in a situation where you might want to course correct following deeper analysis. But implicit in the assignment of handles is a claim that you ought to adjust more than you do in a certain direction. And you don&#x27;t want achieving a balance of opposite mistakes to depend on the relative catchiness of named concepts. When you lift the pot by one handle, the soup spills out.</p><p>(This isn&#x27;t, on its own, an argument against giving your ideas catchy names, so much as an argument for spending plenty of time discussing trade-offs and how to do the necessary deeper analysis. But recall that it&#x27;s still mostly the handle that gets remembered.)</p><h2>8. Reification</h2><p>You&#x27;ll tend to treat your named ideas as more concrete than they are, as meaning one particular thing to everyone, as having agency or causal powers, as unchanging and non-reframeable, as universal and context-independent, as territory, as binary, as objective.</p><p>(I wonder if this is related to a lot of our apparent confusion about double crux—people (<a href=""https://more-whales.tumblr.com/post/166227411782/people-are-talking-about-double-crux-a-bunch-on"">including me</a>) questioning its status as The Technique, while Duncan keeps trying to clarify how it&#x27;s not about executing an algorithm, it&#x27;s about internalizing what generates the algorithm; it&#x27;s not designed for use in earnest, it&#x27;s a pedagogical tool for practicing mental habits; it&#x27;s not about Double Crux, it&#x27;s about double-cruxiness.)</p><h2>9. Rounding error</h2><p>Conor again:</p><blockquote><p>[What you gain by the proliferation of jargon includes] being embedded in a culture where people are diligently seeking out and popularizing such distinctions makes a given individual far more likely to pay attention to subtle distinctions themselves, accelerating the process of cultural accumulation of nuance and detail.</p></blockquote><p>Or, well, the opposite of that, where you round everything off to ingroup-approved jargon.</p><p style=""text-align:center;"">***</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">You can&#x27;t stop titling your blog posts, but don&#x27;t force it, or you&#x27;ll end up with virality tracking the wrong things (more so than usual, anyway). In particular, maybe don&#x27;t optimize so much towards things like catchiness, metaphorical weight, uniqueness, and communicability—even for the sake of rapid, rigorous, distinction-rich, high-level discussion (or perhaps especially for that sake, since this kind of chunking is either unnecessary or destructive for all of these but speed)—over choosing words that prepare people to read and understand what you say.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">(And even as far as speed of communication, what&#x27;s weird is that the rationalist writing stereotype is absurdly prolix—it feels like the compression isn&#x27;t happening where it matters, just where it feels powerful for hiding complex abstraction in a minimally intelligible way.)</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">You shouldn&#x27;t stop trying to draw more distinctions, but maybe you can do that without encouraging one particular way of pointing to your distinction to reify and metastasize.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">You won&#x27;t stop sloppily compressing and combining complex ideas, but maybe worry more about unpacking things, giving examples, checking understanding, and asking questions.</p></div></div></div></div>",whales,whales,whales,

I&#x27;m working from my memories of the blog posts, and from a discussion I had with Robin Hanson and Katja Grace in late 2012. Please let me know if any of this is inaccurate!]</p><p>One of the key differences of opinion in the <a href=""https://intelligence.org/ai-foom-debate/"">Hanson-Yudkowsky AI-Foom Debate</a> is about the idea of a &quot;decisive advantage&quot;. If I&#x27;m not misrepresenting the parties horribly, the idea is that some point in a world with AGI, some AGI-enabled party uses their greater intelligence to increase their general power: money, resources, control over others, intelligence and suchlike. That greater power increases their ability to gain power, resulting in a snowball effect that ends with some party having control over the outcomes for all of Earth-originating life.</p><p>Robin asks the very reasonable question: if that&#x27;s how things work, why hasn&#x27;t it already happened? What stops the largest business using its decisive power over smaller ones to defeat and absorb them, growing ever larger and more powerful until all other businesses fall to its power? Why do we have multiple nations today, when this model would seem to predict that a single state should ultimately conquer and rule all? I don&#x27;t remember Robin proposing an answer of his own: a mechanism or theoretical model that would lead us to expect multiple powers. But it seems like a good question, and it&#x27;s bugged me ever since.</p><p>I think I&#x27;d need to be much more of a student of history than I am to have any confidence in an answer, so let me share some wild speculation that might at least start discussion:</p><ul><li><p>Regulation: Such growth isn&#x27;t an option for legal businesses at all, because states exist. So powerful a business would challenge the power of the state, and the state is in a position to disallow that. The explicit purpose of monopoly legislation is to stop a business which has become very powerful in one area from leveraging that to become powerful elsewhere. </p></li><li><p>Principal-agent problems: it sure would be easier to keep an empire together if you could reliably appoint generals and rulers who always did what you told them to. Especially if the round-trip time for getting them a message is on the order of weeks, and you have to entrust them with the discretion to wield tremendous power in the mean time.</p></li><li><p>Moral norms: Nuclear weapons gave the USA a decisive advantage at the end of WWII. If the USA had been entirely ruthless and bent on power at any cost, it would immediately have used that advantage to cripple all rivals for world superpower and declared its rulership of the world.</p></li></ul><p>I don&#x27;t expect any of these factors to limit the growth of an AGI. Is there some more general limit to power begetting power that would also affect AGI?</p></div></div></div></div>",ciphergoth,ciphergoth,Paul Crowley,

Arguably, any statement of the form “I am a __” is an identity. Of course, we usually reserve the term for the statements which feel especially core to us in describing and predicting ourselves, and in expressing our values and aspirations. Such identities may have <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/jsh/strategic_choice_of_identity/"">their</a> <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/idj/use_your_identity_carefully/"">benefits</a>, but they also come with a number of <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/identity.html"">perils</a>. In particular, we are prone to a) become distressed by any perceived threat to an identity, and b) become utterly inflexible around shifting, modifying, or discarding identities. These effects can be detrimental to both personal wellbeing and goal attainment. Sanity, however, can be regained if we recognize that our identities do not exist unto themselves, and are instead [often subconscious] strategies towards the attainment of specific goals and values.</p><h2>Identities are Strategies towards Goals</h2><p>Consider a person who prides themselves on their identity as a writer: “I am a writer.” This identity is precious because there is an implicit statement of the form “I am a writer[, and therefore I will have a job, income, status, friends, lovers, and my life will be good].” The implicit statement is the goal to be obtained and the explicit identity is the strategy for achieving that goal. The value of the identity derives from the goal is supports.  </p><p></p><p>I describe these plans as subconscious because more often than not they are not articulated. Many people have an identity around being intelligent, but I expect that if you ask them why this important, they will need a few moments to generate their answer. I also expect that in many cases the belief in the goodness of an identity is absorbed from society and it is social drives which motivate it for an individual. In that case, the full identity statement might go “I am a __ [and therefore society will approve of me]” whether or not an individual would admit it. In the most general case, it’s “I am a __ [and therefore <strong><em>goodness</em></strong>].”</p><h2>Threats to the Identity are Threats to the Goal</h2><p>Given that an identity is a strategy for achieving a goal, any threat to the identity is a threat to the goal. The degree of threat perceived is proportional to the importance of the goal and to the extent that the identity is sole strategy for achieving the goal. If someone believes that being a writer is their sole avenue for having a good and fulfilling life, <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/o2k/flinching_away_from_truth_is_often_about/"">they are going to get upset</a> when that identity is challenged. This holds even if person does not consciously recognize that their identity is part of a plan. It is enough that some part of their mind, S1 or whatever, has firmly stamped “being a writer” as critical for having a good life.</p><p></p><p>Consider, though, someone who has identities both around being a writer and around being a musician. Suppose that this person has achieved considerable fame and fortune as a musician and resultantly already has wealth, friends, lovers, etc. by dint of this identity alone. I predict that this person will be less bothered by challenges to writing ability than the person who staking themselves on being a writer. If the writer-only has their manuscript rejected, it will be devastating, whereas for the writer-musician, it will be a mere disappointment.</p><h2>Protect the Goal and the Identity Can Be Free</h2><p>If threats to identity are really about threats to goal-attainment, then the key to working with identities becomes a) surfacing the hidden goals and, b) ensuring there is security around attaining those goals. Tell <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/o2k/flinching_away_from_truth_is_often_about/"">the child</a> that they’re not cut out to be writer and they’ll tantrum, but tell them they’re not cut to be a writer yet have phenomenal painting skills, and they might just listen. Substitute one less viable plan for a new and better one. Other variations include exposing that the goal in fact has already been attained, as in the case of the writer-musician above, or recognizing that the identity in fact is going to be an ineffective plan regardless, e.g. giving up on being a goth because you realize that no one thinks goths are cool anyway.</p><h2>Times I Shifted Identities</h2><p>Recognizing my true goals and whether or not they are likely to be attained has allowed me to become flexible around, or even completely discard, identities which I have had for years or even decades. When I decided that I’d become an engineer in 2008, I formed a strong identity around being a “technical person.”  This was pure goodness to. Yet after deciding that my top priority was the long-term flourishing of civilization over building cool things right now, I realized that I needed to consider whether pursuing a technical path was really the best thing I could do. This was always an immensely difficult thing to do. I felt that definitely one day I&#x27;d move out of doing tech work, but not so soon! Recently though, I did make such a switch. By recognizing that a new path would maximize my values far more than the old, I transitioned from a Data Scientist role to a Product Manager role with little pain. I was giving up on spending my time of technical problems, but this path was truer to my real values and unquestionably was the one I must take.</p><p>Another identity triggered the line of thinking which led to this post. During a religious youth, I absorbed that anything bodily is crass and bestial and is only the mental and intellectual which are dignified. Though I left my youth far behind, this message stuck: the biological is undignified, shameful, bestial; only the mental and intellectual are good. For years, eating, drinking, sex, physical pleasure, etc. have felt embarrassing to one degree or another.  My mind insisted this attitude was a core value of mine -- terminal, unquestionable. Sure, it suspiciously looked like the message I’d been taught as a kid, but it just felt so damn certain. Conceivably it was, but it still meant I lived in a state of conflict. After all I am still human with largely normal human biological drives and needs and I was doing those things even while ashamed. One way or another, I needed to get some kind of resolution around this identity.</p><p>To that end, at a recent CFAR workshop I began earnestly questioning what was going on in my head being open to any outcome. To my surprise, the exercise made me feel threatened in the exact same way I feel when socially threatened. This was odd -- if the anti-biology/mental-only thing was a core value, then I shouldn&#x27;t feel socially threatened. In which case it couldn&#x27;t be a core value. No, it was a deeply cached alief that it was shameful to be biological and that others would judge me if ever I unabashedly sought biological pleasure. Of course, that&#x27;s absurd! No one I associate with feels that at all. People revel in pleasure of all kind! When I thoroughly exposed the anti-biology identity to the evidence by just thinking about it for a few minutes, the identity relented and gave itself up. I was suspicious for some time, but I now enjoy all forms of pleasure without guilt or shame.</p><p>I remain surprised, and yet exposing and protecting underlying goals continues to work. A final example: for many years I&#x27;ve had a palpable desire to be wealthy -- an identity which has long interfered with my ability to consider non-profit work. I felt that I could only move into non-profit work, my eventual plan, once I&#x27;d saved up sufficient wealth. When I recognized that the identity of &quot;wealthy person&quot; was really just about status, and that already I&#x27;m pretty content with my status, this identity evaporated too. The goal it served had already been attained, the identity just hadn&#x27;t got the memo yet.</p><p></p><p>To close, the questions to be asked are: What are you identities? Which goal does each of them serve? And do they serve them well? </p><p></p></div></div></div></div>",Ruby,ruby,Ruby,

<p>By way of <a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/09/18/book-review-mastering-the-core-teachings-of-the-buddha/#comment-548073"">the comments on SlateStarCodex</a>, from Essential Sufism:</p>
<blockquote><p>‘There was a poor fisherman who was a Sufi teacher. He went fishing every day, and each day he would distribute his catch to the poor of his village, except for a fish head or two that he used to make soup for himself His students dearly loved and admired their ‘fish-head sheikh.”</p>
<p>One of the students was a merchant. Before traveling to Cordoba, the teacher asked him to convey his greetings to his own teacher, the great sage Ibn ‘Arabi, and to ask the sage for some advice to help him in his own spiritual work, which he felt was going very slowly.</p>
<p>When the merchant arrived at Ibn ‘Arabi’s house, he found, much to his surprise, a veritable palace surrounded by elaborate gardens. He saw many servants going back and forth and was served a sumptuous meal on gold plates by beautiful young women and handsome young men. Finally he was brought to Ibn ‘Arabi, who was wearing clothing fit for a sultan. He conveyed his teacher’s greetings and repeated his teacher’s request for spiritual guidance. Ibn ‘Arabi said simply, “Tell my student that he is too worldly!” The merchant was shocked and offended by this advice coming from someone living in such worldly opulence.</p>
<p>When he returned, his teacher immediately asked about his meeting with Ibn ‘Arabi. The merchant repeated Ibn ‘Arabi’s words and added that this sounded totally absurd coming from such a wealthy, worldly man.</p>
<p>His teacher replied, “You should know that each of us can have as much material wealth as his soul can handle without losing sight of God. What you saw in him was not merely material wealth but great spiritual attainment.” Then the teacher added, with tears in his eye, “Besides, he is right. Often at night as I make my simple fish-head soup, I wish it were an entire fish!” ‘</p></blockquote>
<p>The comment finishes, and others agree:</p>
<blockquote><p>Plausible, but one might think “pretty convenient for those with temporal power, especially holders of hereditary positions, as a lot of Sufi leadership is.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Responders were also not thrilled by Ibn &#8216;Arabi&#8217;s behavior:</p>
<blockquote><p>Truly, The Donald is the greatest Sufi master.</p></blockquote>
<p>and:</p>
<blockquote><p>Yyyyeah… that sounds a lot like the kind of abuse that gets used as an example when they warn you about joining a cult.</p></blockquote>
<p>The fish-head monk understands.</p>
<p>Often at night as he makes his simple fish-head soup, he wishes it were an entire fish.</p>
<p>This desire is not compatible with his spiritual path. He journeys hungry and jealous. This gross distraction halts his progression on his path. When one is constantly hungry, it is impossible to focus on other things. His mind turns to fish. He is too worldly!</p>
<p>He also seeks to be seen as the fish-head monk, concerned with what others see rather than his own path. This also is not compatible. Again he is too worldly.</p>
<p>Ibn &#8216;Arabi admonishes the monk not for giving up too little, but for giving up too much. He says, eat the whole fish! We each must eat our fill. Then turn to your quest.</p>
<p>Ibn &#8216;Arabi faces the opposite challenge. Wealth frees us from worldly desire by meeting our needs. Wealth enslaves us by adding new needs. Our needs remain unmet.</p>
<p>Perhaps Ibn &#8216;Arabi has all he needs, and turns his mind fully to the spiritual. What a great man! Truly he has the wealth that he can handle.</p>
<p>Perhaps Ibn &#8216;Arabi needs all he has, and turns his mind fully to the spiritual. Perhaps not a great man. But a good man. A man trying. Truly he has the wealth that he can handle.</p>
<p>Perhaps Ibn &#8216;Arabi has all he needs, and turns his mind to needing more. Perhaps he spends his day separating marks from their wealth, ordering servants and indulging in hedonism. What a terrible man!</p>
<p>Which is he? Impossible to know for sure. Listen for the likelihood ratios. Update your priors.</p>

Qk4h5cCcLmDXuuXYW,Beginners’ Meditation,beginners-meditation,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Qk4h5cCcLmDXuuXYW/beginners-meditation,2017-10-14T12:10:00.338Z,2,10,5,False,False,,"<p>I was about to meditate. There was a beginners&#8217; meditation class three blocks away at the 14th Street Y. Seemed wrong to not check it out. Low risk, potential high reward. Non-zero story value. Might even learn something.</p>
<p>It was held in Room 403. Not in the gym. In the preschool. Not great.</p>
<p>I looked inside. I saw a circle of about twenty folding chairs. Sitting in most of the chairs were very old women, chatting. Whatever filter was operating was not subtle.</p>
<p>It said, you are not the target.</p>
<p>Welcome to Meditators Anonymous. My name is Zvi. Hi, Zvi.</p>
<p>I asked if I was in the right room, hoping I wasn&#8217;t. I was. Despite lowered expectations, I sat down.</p>
<p>They passed around a petition to keep the class going after its one month engagement. This was class two. Impressive customer loyalty. Was a there there after all?</p>
<p>Several minutes late, the circle was complete. Me. One instructor. One Asian man. One Amy Poehler lookalike. Twenty-two very senior female citizens.</p>
<p>We were told meditation was us getting to know ourselves. Accepting our own friend request on Facebook. I tried not to make too much of a face. I tried not to make too little of a face. Would have been a lie. People deserve honest feedback.</p>
<p>We went around, said our names and mentioned something that warmed our hearts this past week. To get to know each other. I noticed I was confused. What did that have to do with meditation?</p>
<p>Some mentioned small niceties. Most mentioned babies. They especially loved fathers with babies, doing heroic things like pushing strollers or carrying the baby.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s to you, baby carrying father. Here&#8217;s to you.</p>
<p>My son Gideon had been born the previous Thursday. So I won.</p>
<p>I like victory. Big fan. Passed the test just like all the rest. But never really understood the reasons why I took it in the first place.</p>
<p>We were told to sit comfortably in our folding chairs. Not a beginner task.</p>
<p>We were told to sit up fully straight, in a relaxed position. Some people can do that.</p>
<p>We were told to keep our eyes open, aiming six feet ahead on the floor, to take our practice into the world. We were told to relax our shoulders, and put our hands on our thighs. Can do.</p>
<p>Focus on the breath, either at the belly, chest or nose. If we have thoughts, label that thinking and come back to the breath. She mentioned things we might be distracted by. They were distracting. I got briefly hungry. I came back to the breath.</p>
<p>That was it. The whole instruction. The meditation itself lasted maybe ten minutes. There were people fidgeting. The instructor eyed her watch. I had thoughts. Many were meta. Is that common? Perhaps common but not discussed. I came back to the breath. We finished.</p>
<p>The instructor went over  &#8216;the practice&#8217; again, asking us to name the steps. Like this was a classroom. It was. So, fair? Still infantilizing. Disrespectful of my time. This wasn&#8217;t complicated. Sit up straight, hands on thighs, look down six feet, focus on breath, bring focus back.</p>
<p>That was &#8220;the practice.&#8221; It had an exotic-sounding name.</p>
<p>Teacher said we keep our eyes open and sit in chairs so we don&#8217;t fall asleep. Must. Be. Nice. I envy those who fall asleep that easily. I am not enlightened.</p>
<p>I also wonder if that means that if you <em>don&#8217;t </em>fall asleep, you <em>should </em>lie down. Tempting!</p>
<p>Teacher took questions. Students pointed out focusing is hard. She agreed. They asked if it stops being hard. She said it doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Teacher concluded with a call to &#8216;daily practice.&#8217; If you had two minutes, that was all right. Two minutes will change your life!</p>
<p>How, exactly?</p>
<p>I know why I&#8217;m meditating. I&#8217;ve talked, theorized, modeled, gotten recommendations, <a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/09/18/book-review-mastering-the-core-teachings-of-the-buddha/"">read the review post</a>, read the comments, <a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/09/20/meditative-states-as-mental-feedback-loops/"">read the other post</a>, done better theorizing and modeling, and <a href=""https://smile.amazon.com/Mind-Illuminated-Complete-Meditation-Integrating/dp/0990847705/ref=smi_www_rco2_go_smi_g2609328962?_encoding=UTF8&amp;%2AVersion%2A=1&amp;%2Aentries%2A=0&amp;ie=UTF8"">read the book</a> up to where I couldn&#8217;t tell if it was talking nonsense anymore. Stage Four. Reading further would only distract. Beginner mind. So far so legit. Exceeds expectations. Tentatively recommended, could tell you why. Some day.</p>
<p>This class made no such attempt. No goals. No explanations. You <em>make friends with yourself</em>, on two minutes a day? No there there. Epic fail.</p>
<p>So why were <em>these old ladies </em>meditating? What kept them coming back, even signing a petition? Wasn&#8217;t point <em>you only need to come once? </em>Was this an excuse to share warm father and baby anecdotes? Why else would they want the class to continue? Why else were so many of them there so early?</p>
<p><a href=""http://kajsotala.fi/2017/09/nobody-does-the-thing-that-they-are-supposedly-doing/"">Nobody Does the Thing They Are Supposedly Doing.</a></p>
<p>I hope that&#8217;s it. I wish them well. They seemed nice.</p>",Zvi,zvi,Zvi,

<p>As you can imagine, it&#8217;s been quite a week. We are all doing well, and slowly recovering aside from lack of sleep.</p>
<p>I encourage you to send your congratulations, but as an experiment I&#8217;m adding a twist: You need to say congratulations <em>differently than all previous congratulations. </em>No duplicates!</p>
<p>As you can also imagine, my available time will be limited in the coming weeks and months, so posting likely will be lighter. This is also a natural stopping point. I&#8217;ve said the community-related things I most needed to say. I have more thoughts, and will doubtless share some, but they seem less pressing. Sequence complete.</p>
<p>If you wish to join us for Friday night <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/10/07/bring-back-the-sabbath/"">Sabbath dinner</a>, please email me to let us know so we can prepare. If you can found this and can figure out my email, you&#8217;re probably invited. We&#8217;d love to meet some new people, and to see some old friends. We start at 6:30. Also let me know if you&#8217;d like to swing by on a Saturday to chat or watch some football.</p>
<p>My offer of strategic consultation for all causes I don&#8217;t actively oppose remains open. Only two people have taken me up on it, so I am reminding everyone that it exists. Response times might be not so fast right about now, and if I get too many requests I&#8217;ll have to limit this, but for now the line is open.</p>
<p>In conclusion, celebrate. Good times. Everyone around the world, come on!</p>

qzpcyKioYfHWmcasv,You can never be universally inclusive,you-can-never-be-universally-inclusive,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/qzpcyKioYfHWmcasv/you-can-never-be-universally-inclusive,2017-10-14T11:30:04.250Z,36,16,9,False,False,,"<p>A discussion about the article “<a href=""http://www.thagomizer.com/blog/2017/09/29/we-don-t-do-that-here.html"">We Don’t Do That Here</a>” (h/t <a href=""https://siderea.dreamwidth.org/"">siderea</a>) raised the question about the tension between having inclusive social norms on the one hand, and restricting some behaviors on the other hand.</p><p>At least, that was the way the discussion was initially framed. The thing is, inclusivity is a bit of a bad term, since you can never really be <em>universally</em> inclusive. Accepting some behaviors is going to attract people who like engaging in those behaviors while repelling people who don’t like those behaviors; and vice versa for disallowing them.</p><p>Of course, you can still create spaces that are more inclusive than others, in being comfortable to a broader spectrum of people. But the way you do that, is by disallowing behaviors that would, if allowed, repel more people that the act of disallowing them does.</p><p>If you use your social power to shut up people who would otherwise be loudly racist and homophobic and who then leave because they don’t want to be in a place where those kinds of behaviors aren’t allowed, then that would fit the common definition of “inclusive space” pretty well.</p><p>That said, the “excluding racists and homophobes” thing may make it sound like you’re only excluding “bad” people, which isn’t the case either. Every set of rules (including having no rules in the first place) is going to repel some completely decent people.</p><p>Like, maybe you decide to try to make a space more inclusive by having a rule like “no discussing religion or politics”. This may make the space more inclusive towards people of all kinds of religions and political backgrounds, since there is less of a risk of anyone feeling unwelcome when everyone else turns out to disagree with their beliefs.</p><p>But at the same time, you are making the space less inclusive towards people who are perfectly reasonable and respectful people, but who would <em>like</em> to discuss religion or politics. As well as to people who aren’t so good at self-regulation and will feel uncomfortable about having to keep a constant eye on themselves to avoid saying the wrong things.</p><p>And maybe these people would feel more comfortable at a different event with different rules, which was more inclusive towards <em>them</em>. Which is fine. <a href=""https://theunitofcaring.tumblr.com/post/135162290121/hi-i-have-a-quick-question-i-tried-googling-but"">Competing access needs</a>:</p><p><em>Competing access needs is the idea that some people, in order to be able to participate in a community, need one thing, and other people need a conflicting thing, and instead of figuring out which need is ‘real’ we have to acknowledge that we can’t accommodate all valid needs. I originally encountered it in disability community conversations: for example, one person might need a space where they can verbally stim, and another person might need a space where there’s never multiple people talking at once. Both of these are valid, but you can’t accommodate them both in the same space.</em></p><p><em>I wrote a while ago that I think this concept extends to a lot of activist/social justice community challenges and a lot of the difficulty of designing good messages. For example, body positivity: some people need to hear “love your body! no matter who you are you are soooo sexy” and some people really hate being told that they’re ‘sexy’. Or some gay people might need a space where it’s against the rules to ask “well, what if it actually is morally wrong to be gay?” but other gay people (like me of a few years ago) might need a space where they can ask that so there can be a serious discussion and they can become convinced that they’re okay.</em></p><p>Every set of rules is going to be bad for someone, so a better question than “how to make this space inclusive” is “who do we want to make this space inclusive towards”. You’re always going to exclude some people who aren’t jerks or bad people, but would just prefer a different set of rules. And you just have to accept that.</p><p>See also: <a href=""https://theunitofcaring.tumblr.com/post/100561778176/safe-spaces-and-competing-access-needs"">The Unit of Caring on Safe Spaces and Competing Access Needs</a>.</p>",Kaj_Sotala,kaj_sotala,Kaj_Sotala,
PXqQhYEdbdAYCp88m,"""Focusing,"" for skeptics.",focusing-for-skeptics,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/PXqQhYEdbdAYCp88m/focusing-for-skeptics,2017-10-14T07:00:00.000Z,110,90,27,False,False,https://medium.com/@ThingMaker/focusing-for-skeptics-6b949ef33a4f,"<p>Gendlin’s Focusing technique is super rad. I know this because <i>everybody</i> keeps telling me so.</p><p>(Okay, not quite everybody, but a really tediously large percentage of the people in my online social circle.)</p><p>But I’ve tried it a bunch of times, in a bunch of variants, with a bunch of qualified mentors trying to help, and it’s just never clicked. I’ve listened to the audio book and gone through all the steps, and it just doesn’t do anything for me.</p><p>So here’s my variant—the thing that I do instead, which I claim is using the same hardware and software and providing me with the same kind of improved introspective access. If you’re one of those skeptics who thought it all sounded nuts, or one of those unlucky people who thought it sounded <i>awesome</i> but could never make it work, this post has your name on it.</p><hr><p>The “big idea” of Focusing (according to me) is that parts of your subconscious System 1 are storing up massive amounts of accurate, useful information that your conscious System 2 isn’t really able to access. There are things that you’re aware of “on some level,” data that you perceived but didn’t consciously process (see <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindsight""><u>blindsight</u></a> as both concrete example and metaphor), competing goalsets that you’ve never explicitly articulated, and so on and so forth.</p><p>Focusing is a technique for bringing some of that data up into conscious awareness, where you can roll it around and evaluate it and do something about it. Half of the value comes from just <i>discovering that the information exists at all </i>(e.g. noticing feelings that were always there and strong enough to <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/hBKnkx8xvmhGZPdmg/goodhart-s-imperius-1""><u>Imperius</u></a> you but which were somewhat “under the radar” and subtle enough that they’d never actually caught your attention), and the other half comes from having new models to work with and new theories to test. If I manage to recognize that e.g. a significant chunk of my romantic problems stem from self-censorship pressure because of a strong aversion to seeming needy, I suddenly have threads to pull on rather than falling back to just “Yeah, things with Cameron are not great.”</p><p>The actionable claim of Focusing (again, according to me) is that this information expresses itself in “felt senses” in the body—think butterflies in the stomach, or your throat closing up, or the heat of embarrassment in your cheeks, or a heavy sense of doom that makes your arms feel leaden and numb, or whatever physiological sensation happens to you when you catch yourself about to tell a lie. The brain doesn’t know how to drop its information directly into your verbal loop, so instead it falls back on influencing your physiology and hoping that you notice (or simply respond).&nbsp;</p><p>Gendlin recommends a series of steps that help you build up the skill of noticing and dialoguing with these felt senses until they yield their precious data (often changing or disappearing in the process).</p><p>I’m going to focus (tee hee) on the one part of Gendlin’s process that makes the most sense to me, which is <i>finding the felt sense’s True Name.</i> In the official algorithm, this is step three—finding a handle. In my version, it’s basically the whole technique.</p><hr><p><i>Note: it's worth mentioning that when Gendlin titled his process ""focusing,"" he meant it in the sense of ""gently turning the knob on a microscope to bring things into focus,"" and definitely </i>not<i> in the sense of ""buckle down and try real hard to effortfully bring your attention to bear.""</i></p><hr><p>All right, diving in. &nbsp;First, take a look at this face.<br>&nbsp;</p><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*ueBd2qH1b_0rsR0-4UOiwQ.png""></figure><p><br>A particular face making a particular expression is going to be our metaphor for a felt sense. Faces and expressions are rich in contrast and detail, they’re extremely specific and recognizable, and they’re very hard to describe in words—just like my implicit models of the dynamics between me and Cameron and all of our history and all of my unstated assumptions about how romantic relationships work.</p><p>(Side note: Cameron isn’t real. Cameron is like Maria in a Counting Crows song.)</p><p>A <i>sketch,</i> on the other hand, is <i>compressed.</i> It can be evocative, but it’s sparse and utilitarian, conveying as much of the relevant information as possible with economy of line. In order to get something as rich as a real face out of a sketch, your brain has to do a lot of processing, and regenerate a lot of information from cached models and past experiences.<br>&nbsp;</p><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*__2GVEOub6DrtNXpDVo0YQ.png""></figure><p><br>What’s most important for our metaphor is the concept of trueness. Fit, accuracy, veracity—the quality of an actual correspondence between model and reality. It’s not about how detailed or technically sophisticated the sketch is, it’s about whether it <i>matches what it’s trying to match</i>.<br>&nbsp;</p><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*LWpnWTaqJPb30zXFmixAvA.png""></figure><p><br>The relationship between [words] and [felt senses] is analogous to the relationship between [sketches] and [faces]. You could riff off of the old saying and claim that “a felt sense is worth a thousand words.”&nbsp;</p><p>And the practice of Focusing (or at least my version of it) is one of using careful introspective attention to zero in on the <i>right</i> words. The name or “handle” you come up with won’t be anywhere near the whole story, but it can nevertheless be the short, compressed version of the <i>right</i> story.</p><p>(The same principle applies to “partial” sketches—you could imagine just a few lines around the nose and one side of the jaw that <i>don’t</i> convey the whole picture, but <i>do</i> very accurately match a part of it. In our metaphor, that would be like gaining clarity on one aspect of the thing that’s bothering you, even if you still can’t see the whole picture.)</p><p>(Also, while the rest of this post focuses on words specifically, it's worth noting that you could engage in a similar process to translate your felt senses into any other medium, as well. &nbsp;e.g. a vivid mental image, or a scribbled picture, or a free-verse poem, etc. &nbsp;If words aren't working for you, try a different modality.)</p><hr><p>Okay, let’s try it. We’ll bounce back and forth between words and pictures to try to give you a sense of what mental motion I’m making.</p><blockquote><p><i>Okay, so there’s clearly SOMETHING bothering me. And it’s got something to do with Cameron.</i></p></blockquote><p>This is like knowing “the picture is a face” as opposed to maybe “the picture is a fighter jet.” It's a very coarse starting point, trying to get us in the right ballpark.</p><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*3AALAi6VgI_F7ak1uzSFvQ.png""></figure><p>At this point, it helps to get a clear sense of <i>where the problem lives in my body,</i> i.e. does this feeling express itself in any identifiable physical sense? &nbsp;What happens to my subjective physiological experience, when I turn my attention to ""the thing that's bothering me about my relationship with Cameron""? Does the reaction live in my belly, in my limbs, in my head? &nbsp;Do I experience it as an ache, a tingle, a heat, a chill? &nbsp;</p><p>To be clear, you're not actually trying to pin the sensation down and put words on it, at this point—you're just making sure that you know <i>which</i> feeling you're dealing with. &nbsp;If you have multiple stressors in your life, they will likely show up in different ways, and it helps to be dialoguing with a single felt sense at a time.</p><p>It's also worth noting that a lot of people struggle with Focusing <i>specifically because</i> they have a hard time zeroing in on a physiological marker, and according to me, <i>that doesn't mean you can'd do Focusing.</i> &nbsp;I think you can do something analogous with e.g. your sense-of-what's-true—you can make an explicit claim about the problem, and then check whether that claim seems accurate, without ever referencing sinking feelings in your stomach (or whatever).</p><p>So, first iteration:</p><blockquote><p><i>Have we been fighting a lot?</i></p></blockquote><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*DZXKNbDJEV-6l3BqVKCdJQ.png""></figure><blockquote><p><i>No, that’s not it at all.</i></p></blockquote><p>(This is the equivalent of saying “no, not a <i>smiley</i> face, a <i>serious</i> face.”)</p><p>I got that reaction by <i>holding up</i> the hypothesis/potential handle against the feeling and comparing them.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><i>It’s more like — like — ugh, like I never know what to say?</i></p></blockquote><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*DfiTmmWAv00kQV7OakNHBA.png""></figure><blockquote><p><i>No, it’s like I <strong>have</strong> to say the right things, or else.</i></p></blockquote><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*oXcOoNlNxVveOM4gS-JNSQ.png""></figure><p>(Here I’ve gotten a <i>partial</i> match—I’m nowhere near the real story, but <i>something </i>about that handle I just tried out resonated. It has the right flavor, and I can sort of poke around <i>near</i> the thing I just said for other words that might be a closer fit. If the initial flailing about was the “stochastic” part, now I’m in “gradient descent.” &nbsp;Something has responded, something has changed—the nonverbal part of my brain that's trying to send up a message is telling me ""yes, you're getting warmer!"")</p><blockquote><p><i>It’s like — if I say the <strong>wrong</strong> thing, then everything falls apart and it’s all ruined.</i></p></blockquote><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*SAFcuQjRLPIugwH_QlABzg.png""></figure><blockquote><p><i>And it’s like I’m the only one?

Cameron gets to —</i></p></blockquote><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*1j32yhQ2qL9bq5ccDo4GKg.png""></figure><blockquote><p><i>— to —</i></p></blockquote><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*wyS5OdJXNr8VYTIrK7otag.png""></figure><blockquote><p><i>— to <strong>relax.</strong> That’s it. Yeah. It feels like I’m the only one who doesn’t get to relax.</i></p></blockquote><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*B_JJq89I1v_MQuN6iw7OEw.png""></figure><p>(There, I was doing a super-fast scan over a whole bunch of possible words and phrases and explanations, all the while paying very close attention to my truth-detection module. I knew where the answer <i>would</i> be, and I knew its general shape, but I had to keep looking until I found something <i>juuuuust </i>right. It’s like when you mentally stutter past five or six different comebacks to throw at your classmate until you find the one that’s cutting, true, <i>and</i> okay-to-say-even-though-your-teacher-is-listening.)</p><hr><p>You get the idea. As the process continues, the verbal sketch grows more and more accurate, and <i>evokes</i> more and more of the underlying what’s-really-going-on. I can feel a sort of click, or a release of pressure, or a deep rightness, once I say the thing that <i>really</i> completes the picture.</p><p>(In Gendlin’s Focusing, he makes the point that the felt sense will often change—or vanish—once you’ve given it the right handle. It’s sort of as if the part of you that was trying to send up a red flag and expressing itself in a physiological sensation <i>no longer has to keep sending that signal</i> once your conscious brain receives the message. There’s often a relaxing, opening-up sort of feeling once the unrecognized problem becomes explicitly recognized.)</p><blockquote><p><i>The problem is, I feel like I’m the one who has to be the grownup, because if Cameron gets mad and I <strong>don’t</strong> fix it, then that’s it—things are just bad forever. But when <strong>I’m</strong> the one who gets mad, Cameron doesn’t do jack squat. Cameron protects Cameron, and I protect <strong>us</strong>, and that’s something I never get to put down. It feels like I’m the only one who’s putting effort into maintenance, and that makes me feel like Cameron doesn’t really want the relationship at all, or at least doesn’t <strong>value</strong> it and wouldn’t miss it if it ended, and that’s lonely and exhausting and it makes me feel like maybe <strong>I’m</strong> not worth valuing.</i></p></blockquote><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*nI1nNnyoSq4QdiC8HKc2IQ.png""></figure><hr><p>I’ve glossed over a few things in describing this process, to save time. For instance:</p><ul><li>As I mentioned briefly above, the handle doesn’t always come in words—sometimes it can be a vivid image, or a metaphor, or a poem, rather than a straightforward description.</li><li>Often, there’ll be a whole other felt sense (or three) that arises and needs to be either a) dealt with or b) set aside</li><li>Frequently, a given attempt to iterate on finding a handle—a given single step in the process above—will move your overall understanding <i>away</i> from accuracy rather than toward it. That doesn't mean you're doing it wrong. Patience is key.</li></ul><p>And of course, just because you’ve accurately named <i>your brain’s sense of what’s going on</i> doesn’t mean that you’ve found the actual truth—it’s almost trivially easy to construct another side to this story in which Cameron’s trying to relate to me as an equal, but I insist on being patronizing and untrusting and laying blame for things Cameron <i>never asked me to do, why does it always have to be this huge deal, why can’t we just have fights every now and then like normal people and just <strong>get over it </strong>without acting like it <strong>means</strong> something? Now it’s not only that you’ve pissed me off, it’s also that I’m not <strong>allowed</strong> to be angry—that I <strong>have</strong> to calm down and make up or you’ll start acting like our whole relationship is doomed. That’s some serious hostage-taking right there.</i></p><p>Or maybe not. Maybe that isn’t it, and the real problem is on a completely different axis. But either way, I’ve gotten clarity on what was going on in <i>my </i>head, under the hood—on what sorts of narratives and frames resonate with the part of my subconscious that was generating the feelings of frustration or unease in the first place. That’s a <i>huge</i> step forward in turning the problem into something tractable, with gears and levers and switches. Instead of being a Mysterious Mystery, it’s now mundane (which is not to say that it’ll be <i>easy to fix</i>, just that I’m no longer fumbling around in the dark).</p><p>To me, that’s super valuable, even if a lot of the people I know who do Focusing insist I’m doing it wrong.</p>",Conor Moreton,conor-moreton,Conor Moreton,

The first endorses a reductionist, specific view towards tackling akrasia, while the second is about having a policy of self-care when you inevitably fail at your endeavors.]</em></p><h2><strong>There Is No Akrasia:</strong></h2><p><em>[This essay is about how the term “akrasia” isn’t too useful. I argue against using any sort of general label for the feeling of “anti-wantiness”, i.e. when you don’t want to do something. Instead, I push for a reductionist approach to look at the problem.]</em></p><p>“Akrasia” is a term often used to mean “weakness of will”, aka the intention-action gap we covered in Scaling Up in Instrumental Rationality 4.2. It’s when you somehow “want” to do something, yet you still don’t actually do it.</p><p>I also think it&#x27;s an idea that incurs potentially major costs when you hold it in your bag of mental models. I claim that:</p><ol><li><p>Akrasia is often treated as a “thing” by people who learn about it, and this can lead to problems, even though akrasia a sorta-coherent concept.<br/></p></li><li><p>If we want to move forward and solve the problems that fall under the akrasia-umbrella, it’s better to <a href=""https://www.lesserwrong.com/posts/WBdvyyHLdxZSAMmoz/taboo-your-words"">Taboo</a> the term akrasia altogether and instead employ a more reductionist approach that favors specificity </p></li></ol><p>First off, I do think that akrasia <em>is</em> a term that resonates with a lot of people. When I’ve described this concept to friends, they’ve all had varying degrees of reactions along the lines of “Aha! This term perfectly encapsulates something I feel!” </p><p>It does seem, then, that this concept of “want-want versus want” or “being unable to do what you ‘want’ to do” seems to point at a real group of things in the world, at least from a perception standpoint. </p><p>However, I think that this might have inadvertent problems.</p><p>Once people learn the term akrasia and what it represents, they can now pattern-match it to their own associated experiences. I think that, once you’ve reified akrasia, i.e. turned it into a “thing” inside your worldview, problems can occur.</p><p>First off, treating akrasia as a real thing gives it additional weight and power over you: </p><p>When you start to notice the patterns, you can start see akrasia everywhere, even in places where it might not be immediately useful. One example is when people may try less hard because they suddenly realize they’re in the grip of this terrible monster called Akrasia, which seems so big and scary.</p><p>I think this sort of worldview ends up reinforcing some unhelpful attitudes towards solving the problems akrasia represents. As an example, here are two paraphrased things I’ve overheard about akrasia which I think illustrate this. </p><p><em>“Akrasia has mutant healing powers…Thus you can’t fight it, you can only keep switching tactics for a time until they stop working…”</em></p><p><em>“I have massive akrasia…so if you could just give me some more high-powered tools to defeat it, that’d be great…”   </em></p><p>Both of these quotes seem to have taken the akrasia idea a little too far. </p><p>As I’ll later argue, “akrasia” seems to be dealt with better when you see the problem as a collection of more isolated disparate failures of different parts of your ability to get things done, rather than as an umbrella term.</p><p>I think that the current akrasia framing actually makes the problem more intractable. </p><p>I see potential failure modes where people end up using it as an excuse (perhaps not an explicit belief, but as an implicit one) that impacts their ability to do work. Akrasia is one of those things that can feel like an explanation in the same way that genetics can; it can feel like something that you can&#x27;t fight against. And part of this feels like it could be due to a self-fulfilling attitude.</p><p>Just giving people the ability to recognize the bigger pattern and saying, “Hey, all these pieces represent a Thing called akrasia that’s hard to defeat,” could be bad. Having new things in your world model <em>can</em> harm you.</p><p>How can we make the akrasia problem more tractable, then?</p><p>I claimed earlier that akrasia does seem to be a real thing, as it seems to be relatable to many people. </p><p>I think this may actually because akrasia maps onto <em>too many things</em>. It’s an umbrella term for lots of different problems in motivation and efficacy that could be quite disparate problems. The typical akrasia framing lumps problems like temporal discounting with motivation problems like internal disagreements or ugh fields, and more. </p><p>Those are all very different problems with very different-looking solutions!.</p><p>In the above quotes about akrasia, I think that they’re an example of having mixed up the class with its members. Instead of treating akrasia as an abstraction that unifies a class of self-imposed problems that share the property of acting as obstacles towards our goals, we treat it as a problem onto itself.</p><p>Saying you want to “solve akrasia” makes about as much sense as directly asking for ways to “solve cognitive bias”. Clearly, cognitive biases are merely a class for a wide range of errors our brains make in our thinking. The exercises you’d go through to solve overconfidence look very different than the ones you might use to solve scope neglect, for example.</p><p>Under this framing, I think we can be less surprised when there is no direct solution to fighting akrasia—because there isn’t one. </p><p>I think the solution here is to be specific about the problem you are currently facing. </p><p>Once again, we’re back to explication from Act Into Uncertainty from Interlude I.</p><p>It’s easy to just say you “have akrasia” and feel the smooth comfort of a catch-all term that doesn’t provide much in the way of insight. It’s another thing to go deep into your ugly problem and actually, honestly say what the problem is.</p><p>The important thing here is to identify which subset of the huge akrasia-umbrella your individual problem falls under and try to solve that specific thing instead of throwing generalized “anti-akrasia” weapons at it.</p><p>Is your problem one of remembering to do the thing? Then perhaps set up a reminder system. Maybe try out a TAP that works with your routine.</p><p>Is your problem one of hyperbolic discounting, i.e. of favoring short-term gains? Then figure out a way to recalibrate the way you weigh outcomes. Maybe look into precommitting to certain courses of action.</p><p>Is your problem one of insufficient motivation to pursue things in the first place? Then look into why you care in the first place. If it turns out you really don’t care, then don’t worry about it. Else, find ways to source more motivation.</p><p>The basic (and obvious!) technique I propose, then, looks like:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Identify the akratic thing.<br/></strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Figure out what’s happening when this thing happens. Break it down into moving parts and how you’re reacting to the situation. <br/></strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Think of ways to solve those individual parts.<br/></strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Try solving them. See what happens<br/></strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Iterate</strong></p></li></ol><p>Potential questions to be asking yourself throughout this process include:</p><ol><li><p><strong>What is causing your problem? <br/></strong>EX: Do you have the desire but just aren’t remembering? Are you lacking motivation?<br/></p></li><li><p><strong>How does this problem feel? </strong><br/>EX: What parts of yourself is your current approach doing a good job of satisfying? Which parts are not being satisfied?<br/></p></li><li><p><strong>Is this really a problem? <br/></strong>EX: Do you actually want to do better? How realistic would it be to see the improvements you’re expecting? How much better do you think could be doing?</p></li></ol><p>You’re basically just applying reductionism to the problem at hand.</p><p>Here’s an example of how I worked through one instance of this:</p><p>&lt;Cue thinking&gt;</p><p><em>“I suffer from akrasia. </em></p><p><em>More specifically, though, I suffer from a problem where I end up not actually having planned things out in advance. </em></p><p><em>This leads me to do things like browse the internet without having a concrete plan of what I’d like to do next. In some ways, this feels good because I actually like having the novelty of a little unpredictability in life.</em></p><p><em>However, at the end of the day when I’m looking back at what I’ve done, I have a lot of regret over having not taken key opportunities to actually act on my goals. </em></p><p><em>So it looks like I do care (or meta-care) about the things I do everyday, but, in the moment, it can be hard to remember.”</em></p><p>&lt;End thinking&gt;</p><p>Now that I’ve far more clearly laid out the problem above, it seems easier to see that the problem I need to deal with is a combination of:</p><ol><li><p>Reminding myself the stuff I would like to do (maybe via a schedule or to-do list).</p></li><li><p>Finding a way to shift my in-the-moment preferences a little more towards the things I’ve laid out (perhaps with a break that allows for some meditation).</p></li></ol><p>I think that once you apply a reductionist viewpoint and specifically say exactly what it is that is causing your problems, the problem is already half-solved. (Having well-specified problems seems to be half the battle.)</p><p>A better framing, then, might be one where <em>there is no akrasia</em>. </p><p style=""text-align:center;"">There&#x27;s only situations that have yet to be unpacked and understood.</p><p style=""text-align:center;"">++++</p><h2><strong>Recovering from Failure:</strong></h2><p><em>[Thoughts on how to recover from failing yourself. Assumes your feelings are well-intentioned and takes a self-care approach to understand exactly why things are happening.]</em></p><p>I recently broke a commitment I made to myself. Needless to say, this also wasn’t the first time. Yet, after I broke my promise to myself, there was a general feeling of deflation as I realized I’d failed myself once more. This feeling was accompanied by a vicious cycle of a downward spiral of negative emotions.</p><p>Here, we&#x27;ll be endorsing a general policy of being more understanding with yourself when you inevitably fail, in a way that hopefully bypasses a lot of the snowballing negativity.</p><p>My broken promises most often happens in cases of time-inconsistent preferences, where the internal weighing of short-term and long-term rewards gets messed up such that I could want something &quot;now&quot; but also regret it later on.</p><p>For example, say that I’ve decided to avoid playing video games because I know it leads to unhealthy reward associations in my brain. But some part of me craves the gaming experience. </p><p>So one day, I end up violating my self-imposed injunction and play a bunch of matches. At the end of this, I may say, “Never again! I made this mistake again, and I’m terrible for doing so, but I won’t do it again!”</p><p>And of course I&#x27;ll probably later on go and do it again.</p><p>Clearly, then, there’s an important conversation to be had about <em>why</em> I found myself violating the commitment. Perhaps it’d be good to have an in-depth examination to which one of my needs are being satisfied when I break a promise to myself. </p><p>There&#x27;s also another, thing, though, before all that happens, on a level higher up, about a conversation to be had about being able to both take failure in stride and have a philosophy for trying to minimize future “self-failures”.</p><p>Thus there’s two things happening here:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Making sure I don’t fall into a negative spiral following a self-failure.<br/></strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Figuring out how to solve time inconsistency problems in the future.</strong></p></li></ol><p style=""text-align:center;"">++++</p><p>A good start for the first thing is figuring out what sort of <a href=""http://mindingourway.com/the-art-of-response/"">response pattern</a> would be most conducive to moving forward. So here&#x27;s a bit of an emotionally charged mantra-of-sorts for your System when you <em>do</em> feel yourself sinking into a spiral:</p><p><em>First off, look at the whole of things. Unless you’re consistently breaking commitments, it will be the case that, more often than not, you’re doing the right thing. You’re not trying to have a perfect streak; you’re trying to maximize your total impact, over time. A single failure in this point in time is not a signal to </em><a href=""http://mindingourway.com/failing-with-abandon/""><em>fail with abandon</em></a><em>. </em></p><p><em>When you’re playing the long game, nothing matters except moving forward and improving your ability to keep doing things.</em></p><p><em>If anything, failures are to be expected. You should anticipate messing up because it’s ridiculously unlikely you can maintain a perfect streak forever. Still, that’s not a reason to try and less hard.</em></p><p><em>You can both say, “I was very sure this would happen because base rates said they would and I can&#x27;t be extraordinary all the time,” and also say, “I am going to take this in stride and continue improving.” </em></p><p><em>Take the initial sucker punch of negativity, and </em>end the spiral right here<em>. If you have a well-developed response to failure, there’s no reason to let these negative emotions overwhelm you. The dark feeling of self-loathing is merely a preset function your body comes with that attempts to put you in a better position. If you have a better response than your body’s default, then </em>bypass<em> your defaults.</em></p><p><em>Skip to the end of your negative emotion cycle</em></p><p><em>But also don’t lie to yourself. You can’t just pretend that your self-failure didn’t happen—something somewhere isn&#x27;t being fulfilled. The truth is important. Look at the stain and know that you will see many more stains in the future, and this </em>is what it is<em>. </em></p><p><em>You don’t have to accept it, but you do need to acknowledge it.</em></p><p><em>Humans are inconsistent. You are inconsistent. We don’t yet have the ability to make binding commitments. If we’re inconsistent, we can hold commitments and yet break them. But we can also break commitments and </em>yet<em> strive to do better. </em></p><p style=""text-align:center;"">++++</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Once you’re suitably oriented and strengthened, we move to the question of rebuilding a broken promise to ourselves. We’re looking to see what happened to go wrong to try and patch 2. </p><p style=""text-align:left;"">I think a crucial part of starting this process this is knowing when you’re<em> lying to yourself</em>. </p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Back to the video game example, imagine that I think to myself, “Man, how great would it be to play a few matches today?” I could then say things like, “Nah, that’s not a good idea, let’s study some machine learning instead.” </p><p style=""text-align:left;"">But even as I list out those alternatives, I can feel myself already drawn to the video game idea.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Then what actually happens is that I realize I had absolutely no intention to study machine learning in the first place. I already knew that I was going to play some video games, and the other alternatives were generated halfheartedly.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">That’s what I mean by lying to yourself.</p><p style=""text-align:left;""><strong>By the time you violate your own commitments, the internal shift to violate them has already happened somewhere earlier along the line</strong>. </p><p style=""text-align:left;"">You’ve already made your decision to break the promise. </p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Any number of metacognitive safeguards might flare up—like that nagging voice that asks, “Hey, but didn’t we just agree not to fall for temptation last time?”—but they’ll be useless.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">In effect, what’s happening is that you’re already determining the bottom line. If you already made your decision internally, then any attempt to figure out “alternatives” is just paying mere lip service to the idea that you “have yet to make up your mind”.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">One important skill, then, is being able to examine where this shift happens. </p><p style=""text-align:left;"">If you can notice the trigger where you make the true, internal decision (and begin to lie to yourself, pretending that you are still neutral), then you’ve identified a key step to intervene.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">This is in line with the bigger idea of figuring out <em>why</em> you broke your own commitment, as I mentioned earlier. This means probing into your own thoughts and being honest with yourself.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Questions to ask yourself, then, might be with regards to: </p><p style=""text-align:left;""></p><h3 style=""text-align:left;""><strong>Prior to the breaking:</strong></h3><p style=""text-align:left;"">1. What physical and mental states lead to my thinking about the commitment in general?</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">2. Under what circumstances do I feel such a compulsion to violate my commitments?</p><p style=""text-align:left;""></p><h3 style=""text-align:left;""><strong>Moments before breaking:</strong></h3><p style=""text-align:left;"">1. What are the direct thoughts that lead to my breaking?</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">2. Are there any stories / narratives I tell myself when I consider breaking?</p><p style=""text-align:left;""></p><h3 style=""text-align:left;""><strong>The actual breaking:</strong></h3><p style=""text-align:left;"">1. What parts of me are being fulfilled when I do break a commitment?</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">2. What feels good about breaking the commitment?</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">3. What might my desire to break such a commitment mean about what I want / need?</p><p style=""text-align:left;""></p><p style=""text-align:left;"">After the above, you want to ask questions with regards to:</p><h3 style=""text-align:left;""><strong>Solving things:</strong></h3><p style=""text-align:left;"">1. What goes right when I manage to think about breaking a commitment and yet don’t?</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">2. What other actions could satisfy myself in the same way that breaking my commitment does?</p><p style=""text-align:left;""></p><p style=""text-align:left;"">As an example, here are some of my answers to some of the above questions:</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">&lt;Cue thinking&gt;</p><p style=""text-align:left;""><em>Q) Under what circumstances do I feel such a compulsion to violate my commitments?</em></p><p style=""text-align:left;""><em>A) Often, it’s when I just finished something large, and I feel like celebrating / relaxing. There&#x27;s a rush of happiness, something like, &quot;Yay! We just did something Hard! Now we deserve a break!&quot;</em></p><p style=""text-align:left;""><em>Otherwise, it’s when I feel bored / have nothing to do. Then, it slowly pops into my mind as an option. And at other times, it’s when I feel tired and want something that’s not very demanding.</em></p><p style=""text-align:left;""><em>Q) Are there any stories / narratives I tell myself when I consider breaking?</em></p><p style=""text-align:left;""><em>A) Yes. I’ll often tell myself that I won’t break the commitment all the way. Or, I’ll focus on how tempting it feels to fail with abandon (there, I said it! failing with abandon is a seductive option!) and part of my brain uses the strong emotional affect associated with the fantasy to overpower the other sides.</em></p><p style=""text-align:left;""><em>Q) What might my desire to break such a commitment mean about what I want / need?</em></p><p style=""text-align:left;""><em>A) I want a way to relax sometimes. It’s also about finding good breaks, of course, but part of this is that sometimes I really do want to have some good ways of relaxing…but maybe that says something about what sort of person I am? Maybe I want to work on changing how I see breaks?</em></p><p style=""text-align:left;"">&lt;End thinking&gt;</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Once you’ve got a feel for which things are affecting your decision to break the commitment to yourself, you can make a plan of attack on making a more robust self-commitment system.</p><p style=""text-align:center;"">++++</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Two skills that I’ve found to work well after having gone through the above are that of <strong>Generating Good Alternatives</strong> and <strong>Metacognitive Affordances</strong>.</p><h3 style=""text-align:left;""><strong>Generating Good Alternatives:</strong></h3><p style=""text-align:left;"">If you feel the temptation to break a commitment and then pay lip service to generating other choices, you’re obviously lying to yourself—you’ve already determined the bottom line without doing any real reasoning. </p><p style=""text-align:left;"">But now that you’ve got a more clear understanding of yourself in relation to your desires and commitments, you can hopefully start to actually take different choices. </p><p style=""text-align:left;"">By taking a more judgment-free attitude to your actions, when faced with the impetus to break your commitment, you can respond by actually suspending a decision for the time being. You can look to see what needs your body has and how different actions can satisfy them.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">The skill of Generating Good Alternatives is to use this improved self-knowledge to fuel an improved search through the space of possible actions you can take. You do this such that you can actually find novel actions that <em>both</em> satisfy your hidden need <em>and</em> don’t compromise your values and commitments.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">As an example, instead of seeing a desire to play video games as something about your inherent preferences, you can see it as your body trying to cash out some sort of need. </p><p style=""text-align:left;"">My internal dialogue might look like, “Hey, I notice I want to play video games. I wonder that this is a symptom of? I recall that I often feel like this when I need to take some time to just cool off…”</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">From there, I can try to feel out different actions which might also satisfy the need in a better way. </p><p style=""text-align:center;"">++++</p><h3 style=""text-align:left;""><strong>Metacognitive Affordances:</strong></h3><p style=""text-align:left;"">Your metacognition is that awareness you have inside your head that reacts to your thoughts. It’s the part of your brain about your brain. </p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Often, my metacognitive safeguards, as I wrote above, will not work. They will flare and sound the alarm saying, “Alert! You are doing a Bad Thing! This will not pan well for your mind!”. </p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Of course, I don’t really listen that much to it.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Something that has helped me here is having the knowledge that following my metacognition is available to me. There’s some sort of weird self-fulfilling prophecy happening here where if I <em>know</em> that my metacognition will work, this leads me to expect that it will, such that when it actually fires, I&#x27;ll actually find it useful.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">It’s sort of like a meta-metacognitive awareness. I know that paying attention to my thoughts should work. Thus, then my internal safeguards now flare up, I feel the wordless impulse and think “Ah, yes! <em>This</em> thing! It works and is useful!”</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">You want to think of your metacognition as more of a lever that is available to you. It’s about making metacognition more of an affordance.</p><p style=""text-align:center;"">++++</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">With regards to self-promises, I don’t think this resolve everything. I myself still have trouble; this isn’t a cure-all. But I do think that it’s an important key part of self-care and moving forward. The shift and reorientation feels like a key step, and I hope the ritual, question, and techniques help with the overall process.</p><h2 style=""text-align:center;""><a href=""https://www.lesserwrong.com/posts/3MarhJrvYzW9TC9xA/instrumental-rationality-6-attractor-theory""><em><strong>Next E</strong></em>ssay</a></h2></div></div></div></div>",,,,

I keep my living space relatively clean, I get places relatively on time, I maintain a regular 9-to-5, and I have a lot of side projects in my free time that I generally manage to complete. But my life wasn&#x27;t always that way, and most of the general rationality/CFAR methods of coping don&#x27;t work at all for me. Getting diagnosed as an adult with ADD and trying a variety of medications also didn&#x27;t work at all for me. Obviously, generalizing from one mind is a particularly Bad Idea in my case as I&#x27;m rather an outlier, but hopefully things that work for me might be useful for other people. (This may end up as a sequence of Things That Work for Me, but for today I&#x27;m just focusing on one.)<br/><br/>One way I manage to function is to have employment or other life aspects where I feel it is a Moral Imperative to Do The Thing. I call this &quot;Offloading my executive functioning onto my morality,&quot; and it pretty much means setting up my life in a way where Doing Things comes naturally, because otherwise there are immediate negative effects on people I care about. I don&#x27;t want to get into EvPsych stuff, but I feel it is a more natural motivation and How Humans Are Wired.<br/><br/><strong>A bunch of examples:</strong><br/><br/><strong>Bad Idea: </strong>Have a job that lets you arrive whenever. Your arrival time has no effect on anyone else&#x27;s work.<br/><br/><strong>Good Idea:</strong> Have a job where a specific person is depending on you to arrive on time. Maybe your friend can&#x27;t leave his shift until you arrive for yours. Maybe you are teaching a karate class and arriving late is wasting a bunch of people&#x27;s time.<br/><br/>----------<br/><strong>Bad Idea:</strong> RSVP to events with &quot;Maybe&quot;, so that no one&#x27;s put out if you don&#x27;t show.<br/><br/><strong>Good Idea:</strong> RSVP to events with &quot;Yes, AND I need a ride&quot; or &quot;Yes, AND I&#x27;ll bring dessert&quot; so that not showing up is causing a detriment to other people.<br/><br/>------------<br/><strong>Bad Idea:</strong> Have a job like academia where even if your research might be hugely useful, it is theoretic in application and far in the future.<br/><br/><strong>Good Idea:</strong> Have a job like teaching or nursing, where people are relying on you, and not-working has immediate, visible, detrimental results for other people.</p><p>-------------</p><p>In a more traditionally rational framing, these can be summarized as: Use social pre-commitment techniques, and keep things in near mode (Far mode morality does not work for this use for me). But the framing of &quot;Use Morality Instead&quot; tends to point more naturally at the thing that works for me.<br/><br/>Note: A possible downside of this is that I am much less tolerant of things like &quot;People showing up really late for a one-on-one meeting&quot;, because my method of functioning assigns those behaviors as &quot;Morally Bad&quot;.</p></div></div></div></div>",weft,weft,weft,

Yet we are proud of the Project, which was an exciting and ambitious experiment with a new form of EA volunteer work. By launching into this unexplored space, we have provided significant value of information for ourselves and the EA community.</p><p>We believe that we increased the prioritisation skill of team members only to a small extent (and concentrated on one or two people), much less than we hoped. We encountered severe challenges with a heterogeneous team, and an eventual team breakdown that threatened the existence of the Project.</p><p>On the other hand, we feel confident that we learned an enormous amount through the Project, including some things we couldn’t have learned any other way. This goes from team management under strong time pressure and leadership in the face of uncertainty, to group epistemics and quantitative-model-building skills.</p><p>Research-wise, we are happy with our quantitative models, which we see as a moderately useful contribution. We are less excited about the rest of our output, which consumed a lot of time yet feels less relevant.</p><p>We’d like to thank everyone on the <a href=""http://oxpr.io/team"">team</a> for making the Project possible, as well as Owen Cotton-Barratt and Max Dalton for their valuable support.</p><h1>The impact of the Project</h1><h2>What were the goals? How did we perform on them?</h2><p>In a <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pP-TlxHfch0kZeuHimD92CCNJq9esoCGGpFMLtRwIZs/edit?usp=sharing"">document</a> I wrote in January 2017, before the project started, I identified the following goals for the project:</p><ol><li>Publish online documents detailing concrete prioritisation reasoning<br><i>This has direct benefits for people who would learn from reading it, and indirect benefits by encouraging others to publish their reasoning too. Surprisingly few people in the EA community currently write blog posts explaining their donation decisions in detail.</i></li><li>Produce prioritisation researchers<br><i>Outstanding participants of the Oxford Prioritisation Project may be made more likely to become future CEA, OpenPhil, or GiveWell hires.</i></li><li>Training for earn-to-givers<br><i>It’s not really useful for the average member of a local group to become an expert on donation decisions. Most people should probably defer to a charity evaluator. However, <strong>for people who earn to give and donate larger sums</strong>, it’s often worth spending more time on the decision. So the Oxford Prioritisation Project could be ideal training for people who are considering earning to give in the future.</i></li><li>Give local groups something to do (see also Scott Alexander on “<a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/07/18/pushing-and-pulling-goals/"">pushing vs pulling goals</a>”) <i>Altruistic societies or groups may often volunteer, organise protests, write a policy paper, fundraise, etc., even if the impact on the world is actually negligible. These societies might do these things just to gives their members something to do, create a group they can feel part of, and give the society leaders status. But within the effective altruism movement, many of these low-impact activities would appear hypocritical. People in movement building have been thinking about this problem. The Centre for Effective Altruism and other organisations have full-time staff working on local group outreach, but they have not to my knowledge proposed new “things to actually do”. The Project is a thing to do that is not outreach.</i></li><li>Heighten the intellectual level of local groups<br>*Currently most of the EA community is intellectually passive. Many of us have a superficial understanding of prioritisation, we mostly use heuristics and arguments from authority. By having more people in the community who actually do prioritisation (e.g. who actually understand GiveWell’s spreadsheets), we increase the quality of the average conversation. *</li></ol><p>In addition to these give object-level goals, a sixth goal:</p><ol><li>The value of information of the Oxford Prioritisation Project<br><i>Much of the expected impact of the Project comes from discovering whether this kind of project project can work, and whether it can be replicated in local groups around the world in order to get the object-level impacts many times over</i></li></ol><h3>1: Publish online documents detailing concrete prioritisation reasoning</h3><p>Quantity-wise, this goal was achieved. We published 38 blog posts, including individuals describing their current views, minor technical contributions to bayesian probability theory, discussion transcripts and, most importantly, quantitative models.</p><p>However, the extent to which our content engaged with substantial prioritisation questions, and was intellectually useful to the wider EA community, was far less than we expected. Overall, we feel that our substantial intellectual contribution were our quantitative models. Yet these were extremely speculative and developed in the last few weeks of the Project, while most of the preceding work was far less useful.</p><p>Regarding “direct benefits for people who would learn from reading” our research: this is very difficult to evaluate, but our tentative feeling was that this was lower than we expected. We received less direct engagement with our research on the EA forum than we expected, and we believe few people read our models. Indirectly, the models were referenced in some newsletters (for example MIRI’s). However, since our writings will remain online, there may be a small but long-lasting trickle of benefits into the future, from people coming across our models.</p><p>Though we did not expect to break major new conceptual ground in prioritisation research, we believed that the EA community provides too many ‘considerations’-type and too few ‘weighing’-type<a href=""#fn:wc""><sup>1</sup></a> arguments. Making an actual granting decision would hopefully force us to generate ‘weighing’-type arguments, and this was a major impetus for starting the Project. So, we reasoned, even though we might not go beyond the frontier of prioritisation research, we could nonetheless be useful to people with the most advanced EA knowledge, by producing work that helps aggregate existing research into an actionable ranking. We think we were moderately successful in this respect, thanks to our quantitative models.</p><h3>2: Prioritisation researchers</h3><p>This is technically too early to evaluate, but we are pessimistic about it: we do not think the project caused any member who otherwise would not have considered it to now consider prioritisation research as a career<a href=""#fn:car""><sup>2</sup></a>. This is based on impressions of, and conversations with, members.</p><p>This goal was a major factor in our decisions of which applicants to admit to the project. We selected several people who had less experience with EA topics, but who were interested and talented, in order to increase our chance of achieving this sub-goal. In retrospect, this was clearly a mistake, since getting these people up to speed proved far more difficult than we expected, and we still don’t think we had a counterfactual impact on their careers. Looking back, we recognise that there was some evidence for this that we interpreted incorrectly at the time, so we made a mistake in expectation, but not an obvious one.</p><p>As often, we suspect the impact in this category was extremely skewed across individuals. While we think we had no impact on most members, we think there is a small (&lt;5%)<a href=""#fn:probguess""><sup>3</sup></a> chance that we have counterfactually changed the interests and abilities of one team member, such that this person will in the future work in global priorities research.</p><h3>3: Training for earn-to-givers</h3><p>This was not achieved, for two reasons. While at the outset, we believed that there were about 3 team members who might consider earning to give in the future, by the end we think only one of them has a &gt;50% chance of choosing that career path. So even though we provided an opportunity to practice prioritisation thinking, and especially quantitative modelling, we don’t think we had an impact by improving the decisions of future earn-to-givers. Regardless, we believe that this practice failed to increase the prioritisation skill of our team (see previous sections), so we wouldn’t have had impact here anyway.</p><h3>4: Give local groups something to do</h3><p>This goal was achieved. We designed and implemented a new form of object-level group engagement that could theoretically be replicated in other locations. However, it’s debatable whether the cost:benefit ratio of such replications is sufficiently high. See the section: <a href=""#should-there-be-more-similar-projects-lessons-for-replication"">“Should there be more similar projects? Lessons for replication”</a></p><h3>5: Local group epistemics</h3><p>This goal was not achieved.</p><p>One impulse for starting the project was a frustration about the lack of in-depth, object-level intellectual activity in the local student EA community, which we (Jacob and Tom) are both part of. Current activities look like:</p><ul><li>Attending and organising introductory events</li><li>Social events, where conversations focus on:<ul><li>Discussing new developments in EA organisations</li><li>Philosophy, especially ethics</li><li>‘Considerations’-type arguments, with a special focus on controversial, or extreme arguments. Much repetition of well-known arguments.</li></ul></li><li>Fundraising</li></ul><p>We wanted to see more of:</p><ul><li>Discussion of ‘weighing’-type arguments, with a focus on specific, quantifiable claims</li><li>Instead of repetition of known considerations, discussion of individual people’s actual beliefs on core EA questions, and what would change their minds. Conversations at the frontier of people’s knowledge.</li><li>Knowing when people change their minds</li><li>Individuals conducting shallow (3-20 hour), empirical or theoretical research projects, and publishing them online</li></ul><p>We did not believe that the Project alone could have achieved any of these changes. But we were optimistic that it would help push in that direction. We thought members of the local group would become excited about the Project, discuss its technical details, and give feedback. We also thought that team members would socialise with local group members and discuss their work, and hoped that the Project would serve as a model inspiring other more intellectually focused activities. None of these happened.</p><p>The local community was largely indifferent to the Project, as evidenced by an attendance of no more than 10 people at our final decision announcement. Throughout the Project, there was little interaction between the community and team members. In retrospect, we think we could have done more to facilitate and encourage such interaction. But we were already very busy as things were, so this would have needed to trade off against another of our activities.</p><p>Overall we clearly didn’t achieve this goal.</p><h3>6. The value of information of the Oxford Prioritisation Project</h3><p>This goal was arguably achieved, in the sense that the Project produced several unexpected results which carry important implications for future projects. The information gained included:</p><ul><li>Directly applicable knowledge about how to run similar Projects. See below, <a href=""#should-there-be-more-similar-projects-lessons-for-replication"">“Should there be more similar projects? Lessons for replication”</a></li><li>Knowledge of a more general relevance, about how to achieve good results when a group of people are facing an intellectual challenge for which no set guidelines exist. See below, <a href=""#more-general-updates-about-epistemics-teams-and-community"">“More general updates about epistemics, teams, and community.”</a></li></ul><h2>Learning value for Jacob and Tom</h2><p>The Project was a huge learning experience for us both, and especially strongly for Tom. This was the first time Tom led a team. Running a group of prioritisation researchers was a very different task from academic projects or internships we had been involved with in the past.</p><p>Our guess is that between 25% and 75% of the value created by the Project was through our becoming wiser and more experienced. This admittedly subjective conclusion relies on a number of difficult-to-verbalise intuitions, to the effect that we came out of the project knowing more about our own strengths and weaknesses, and how people and groups work. Since we both plan to give a substantial weight to altruistic considerations in our career decisions, this could be impactful.</p><p>Throughout the Project, Tom kept a journal of specific learning points, mostly for his own benefit but also for others who would potentially be interested in replicating the Project. He originally planned to turn these notes into a well-structured and detailed retrospective, but completing this work now looks as though it would not be worth the time cost. Instead he is publishing his notes with minimal editing <a href=""https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B16cnVspvUSLTFpSdnBnZVBuaTA"">here</a>.

Tom also estimates he dedicated at least another 200 hours of less focused time to the Project.</p><p>Jacob estimates he spent 100 hours on the Project.</p><h3>CEA money and time</h3><p>We would guess that the real costs of the £10,000 grant were low. At the outset, the probability was quite high that the money would eventually be granted to a high-impact organisation, with a cost-effectiveness not several times smaller than CEA’s counterfactual use of the money<a href=""#fn:owen""><sup>3</sup></a>. In fact, the grant was given to 80,000 Hours.</p><p>The costs of snacks and drinks for our meetings, and logistics for the final event were about £500, covered by CEA’s local group budget.</p><p>We very tentatively estimate that Owen Cotton-Barratt spent less than 5 hours, and Max Dalton about 15 hours, helping us with the Project over the six months in which it ran. We are very grateful to both for their valuable support.</p><h1>Main challenges</h1><p>We faced a number of challenges; we’ll describe only the biggest ones, taking them in rough chronological order.</p><h2>Different levels of previous experience</h2><h3>Heterogenous starting points</h3><p>Some team members were experienced with advanced EA topics, while others were beginners with an interest in cost-effective charity. This was in part because we explicitly aimed to include some less experienced team members at the recruitment stage (see above, “<a href=""#2-prioritisation-researchers"">2: Prioritisation researchers</a>”). But an equally important factor was that, before we met them in person, we overestimated some team members’ understanding of prioritisation research.</p><p>We selected the team exclusively with an online application form. Once the project started, and we began talking to them in person, it quickly became clear that we had overestimated many team members’ familiarity with the basic arguments, concepts, and stylised facts that constitute the groundwork of prioritisation work. Possible explanations for our mistake include:</p><ul><li>Typical mind fallacy, or insufficient empathy with applicants. Because we knew much more, we unconsciously filled gaps in people’s applications. For example, if someone was vaguely gesturing at a concept, we would immediately understand not only the argument they were thinking of, but also many variations and nuances of this argument. This could turn into believing that the applicant had made the nuanced argument.</li><li>Wishful thinking. We were excited by the idea of building a knowledgeable team, so we may have been motivated to ignore countervailing evidence.</li><li>Underestimating applicant’s desire and ability to show themselves in the best light. We neglected to account for the fact that applicants could carefully craft their text to emphasise their strengths, and mistakenly treated their applications more as if they were transcripts of an informal conversation.</li><li>Insufficiently discriminative application questions. Tom put significant effort into designing a short but informative application. Applicants were asked to provide a CV, a Fermi estimate of the total length of waterslides in the US, and a particular research question they expected to encounter during the project, along with their approach for answering it. After the fact, we not only think that these specific questions were suboptimal<a href=""#fn:applic""><sup>4</sup></a>, but also see clear ways the application process as a whole could have been done very differently and much better (see section <a href=""#smaller-team"">“Smaller team”</a> below). We struggle to think of evidence for this that we interpreted incorrectly at the time, so this may still have been the correct decision in expectation.</li></ul><h3>Continued heterogeneity</h3><p>A heterogenous team alone would not have been a major problem if we hadn’t also dramatically overestimated our ability to bring the less experienced members up to speed.</p><p>We had planned to spend several weeks at the beginning of the project working especially proactively with these team members to fill remaining gaps in their knowledge. We prepared a list of “prioritisation research concepts” and held a rotating series of short presentations on them and we gave specific team members relevant reading material. We expected that team members would learn quickly from each other and “learn by doing”, from trying their hand at prioritisation.</p><p>In fact, we made barely any progress. For all except one team member, we feel that we failed to bring them substantially closer to being able to meaningfully contribute to prioritisation research: everyone remained largely at their previous levels, some high, some low<a href=""#fn:jac2""><sup>5</sup></a>.</p><p>This makes us substantially more pessimistic about the possibility of fostering EA research talent through proactive schemes rather than letting individuals learn organically. (EA Berkeley seemed <a href=""/ea/11q/ea_berkeley_spring_2016_retrospective/"">more positive</a> about their student-led EA class, calling it “very successful”, but we believe it was many times less ambitious). We feel more confident that there is a basic global prioritisation mindset, which is extremely rare and difficult to change by certain kinds of outside intervention, but essential for EA researchers.</p><h2>Team breakdown</h2><p>We were struggling to create a cohesive team where everyone was able to contribute to the shared goal of optimally allocating the £10,000, and was motivated to do so. Meanwhile, some team members became less engaged, perhaps as a result of the lack of visible signs of progress. Meeting attendance began to decline, and the problem worsened until the end of the Project, at which point four out of nine team members had dropped out. After the project only 3 out of 7 team members took the post-project survey. The results have informed our estimates throughout this evaluation.</p><p>While understanding that the dropout rate for volunteer projects is typically high, we still perceived this as a frustrating failure. An unexpected number of team members encountered health or family problems, while others simply lost motivation. Starting around halfway through the Project, the majority our efforts were focused on averting a complete dissolution of the team, which would have ended the Project.</p><p>As a result, we decided to severely curtail the ambition of the Project by choosing our four shortlisted charities ourselves, without team input, and according to different criteria than those we had originally envisioned<a href=""#fn:goalflex""><sup>6</sup></a>. We had been planning to shortlist the organisations with the highest expected impact, as a team, in a principled way. Instead we (Jacob and Tom) took into account our hunches about expected impact as well as the intellectual value of producing a quantitative model of a particular organisation, in order to arrive at a highly subjective and under-justified judgement call.</p><p>We are satisfied with this decision; we believe that it allowed us to create most of the value that could still be captured at that stage, given the circumstances. With a smaller team and a more focused goal, we produced the four quantitative models which led to our final decision.</p><h1>Should there be more similar projects? Lessons for replication</h1><h2>Did the Project achieve positive impact?</h2><h3>Costs and benefits</h3><p>See above, <a href=""#what-were-the-costs-of-the-project"">“What were the costs of the project?”</a>.</p><h3>Tom’s feelings</h3><p>It’s important to make a distinction between the impacts of the Project from a purely impartial perspective, and the impacts according to my values, which give a much larger place to me and my friends’ well-being.</p><p>Given that the object-level impacts (see above, <a href=""#the-impact-of-the-Project"">“The impact of the Project”</a>) were, in my view, low, effects on Jacob’s and my personal trajectories (our academic performance, well-being, skill-building) could be important, even from an impartial point of view.</p><p>Against a counterfactual of “no Oxford Prioritisation Project” (say, if the idea had not been suggested to me, or if we had not received funding), I would guess with low confidence that the Project had negative (impartial) impact. Without the Project, I would have spent these 6+ months happier and less stressed, with more time to spend on my studies. I plan to give significant weight to altruistic considerations in my career decisions, so this alone could have made the project net-negative. In addition, I believe I would have spent significant time thinking about object-level prioritisation questions on my own, and published my thoughts in some form. On the other hand, I learned a lot about team management and my own strengths and weaknesses through the Project. All things considered, I suspect that the Project was a little bit less good than this counterfactual.</p><p>When it comes to my own values, I’m slightly more confident that the Project was negative against this counterfactual. If offered to go back in time to re-experience the same events, I would probably decline.</p><p>Both impartially and personally speaking, there are some nearby counterfactuals against which I am slightly more confident that the Project was negative. These mostly take the form of developing quantitative models with two or three close friends, in an informal setting, and iterating on them rapidly, with or without money to grant. However, these counterfactuals are unlikely; at the time I didn’t have the information to realise how good they would be.</p><p>Going back now to the impartial perspective: despite my weakly held view described above, there are several scenarios for positive impact from the Project which I find quite plausible. For example, I would consider the Project to have paid for itself relative to reasonable counterfactuals if:</p><ul><li>what I learned from the Project helps me improve a major career decision</li><li>the team member mentioned above ends up pursuing global priorities research</li><li>we inspire another group to launch a project inspired by our model, and they achieve radically better outcomes</li></ul><h2>Things we would advise changing if the project were replicated</h2><h3>Less ambition</h3><p>Global prioritisation is very challenging for two reasons. First, the search space contains a large number of possible interventions and organisations. Second, the search space spans multiple very different focus areas, such as global health and existential risk reduction.</p><p>The Project aimed to tackle both of these challenges. This high level of ambition was a conscious decision; we were excited by the lack of artificial restrictions on the search space. Though we had no unrealistic hopes of finding the truly best intervention, or of breaking significant new ground in prioritisation research, we still felt that an unrestricted search space would make the task more valuable, it made it feel more real, and less like a student’s exercise. We implicitly predicted that other team members would also be more motivated by the ambitious nature of the Project, but this turned out not to be the case. If anything, motivation increased after we shifted to less ambitious goals.</p><p>Given that our initial goal proved too difficult, even given the talent pool available in Oxford, we would recommend that potential replications restrict the search space to eliminate one of the two challenges. This gives two options:</p><ul><li>Prioritisation among a pre-established shortlist of organisations working in different focus areas. (This is the option we chose towards the end of the Project).</li><li>Prioritisation in a (small) focus area, such as mental health or biosecurity.</li></ul><p>We would weakly recommend the former rather than the latter, because we already tried it with moderate success, and because it allows starting immediately with quantitative models of the shortlisted organisations (see below, <a href=""#focus-on-quantitative-models-from-the-beginning"">“Focus on quantitative models from the beginning”</a>).</p><h3>Shorter duration</h3><p>Given the circumstances, we believe the Project was too long. A shorter project means less is lost if the Project fails, and the closer deadline could be motivating.</p><p>We would recommend one of two models:</p><ul><li>1-month project with meetings and work sessions at intervals</li><li>1 week retreat, working on the project full-time</li></ul><p>Our most important work, building the actual quantitative models and deciding on their inputs, was done in about this amount of time. The large, early part of the project centering around learning and searching for candidate organizations, was marginally not very useful (see e.g. section <a href=""#continued-heterogeneity"">“Continued heterogeneity”</a> above).</p><h3>Use a smaller grant if it seems easier</h3><p>We initially believed that the relatively large size of the grant (£10,000) would motivate team members not only to work hard, but, more importantly, to be epistemically virtuous – that is, to focus their efforts on actions to improve the final allocation rather than ones that felt fun or socially normative. We now believe that this effect is small, and does not depend much on the size of the grant. For more information, see section <a href=""#more-general-updates-about-epistemics-teams-and-community"">“More general updates about epistemics, teams and community”</a>.</p><p>Where the £10,000 figure may have helped is through getting us more and better applicants by signalling serious intent. But we are very uncertain about this consideration and would give it low weight.</p><p>Overall, our view is that the benefits of a larger grant size are quite small, relative to other strategic decisions, and that a £1000-2000 grant might have achieved nearly all the same benefits<a href=""#fn:disag""><sup>7</sup></a>. On the other hand, the true monetary cost of the grant is low (see above, <a href=""#cea-money-and-time"">“CEA money and time”</a>). Therefore our tentative recommendation is: a £10,000 grant may still be worth getting, but don’t worry too much about it. Be upfront to the funder about the small effect of the money, and consider going ahead anyway if they give you less.</p><h3>Focus on quantitative models from the beginning</h3><p>One of the surprising updates from the Project was that we made much more progress, including the less experienced team members, once we began working on explicit quantitative models of specific organisations. (See section <a href=""#more-general-updates-about-epistemics-teams-and-community"">“More general updates about epistemics, teams and community”</a>.) So we would recommend starting with quantitative models from the first day, even when they are very simple. This may sound surprising, but we urge you to try it<a href=""#fn:jac""><sup>8</sup></a>.</p><h3>More homogenous team</h3><p>We severely overestimated the degree to which we could bring less experienced members of a heterogeneous team up to speed (see above, <a href=""#different-levels-of-previous-experience"">“Different levels of previous experience”</a>). So we would recommend a homogenous team, with all members meeting a high threshold of experience.</p><h3>Smaller team</h3><p>We started with a model where, very roughly, people are either good, conscientious team members, or they get de-motivated and drop out of the team. Under this model, dropouts are not very costly. You lose a team member, but you also lose overhead in dealing with them. So that is a reason to have a bigger team to start with. However, what we actually observed is that demotivated people don’t like working, but the one thing they dislike more is dropping out. Without speculating about the underlying reasons, a common strategy while demotivated (that we ourselves have also been guilty of in the past) is to do the minimal amount of work required to avoid dropping out. Hence, future projects should start with a small team of fully dedicated members rather than a larger team hoping to provide some “buffer” should a team member drop out.</p><p>Having a smaller team also means expending more effort selecting team members; doing so should also help with the problem raised in the above subsection. Although it seemed to us that we had already put a lot of resources into finding the right team, we now see that much more could have been done here, for example:</p><ul><li>a fully-fledged trial period; consisting of a big, top-down managed team from which the most promising few members are then selected to go on (although we worry this could introduce negative anti-cooperative norms and an unpleasant atmosphere).</li><li>making the application process the following: candidates build a quantitative model, receive feedback, and go back to submit a second version; they are then evaluated on the quality of their models</li></ul><h1>More general updates about epistemics, teams, and community</h1><p>We had several hypotheses about how a project like this would affect the members involved, as well as the larger effective altruism community in which it took place. Here are some of our updates. Of course, the Project is only a single data point. Nonetheless, we think it still carries evidence in the same sense that, say, an elaborate field-study might be important without being an RCT.</p><h2>The epistemic atmosphere of a group will be more truth-seeking when a large donation is conditional on its performance.</h2><p><strong>Update:</strong> substantially lower credence</p><p>There are at least two reasons why human intellectual interaction is often not truth-seeking. First, there are conflicting incentives. These can take the form of both internal, cognitive biases or external, structural incentives.</p><p>To some extent the money helped realign incentives. The looming £10,000 decision provided a Schelling point that could be used to end less useful discussions or sub-projects without the violation of social norms that this often entails otherwise.</p><p>Nonetheless, the atmosphere also suffered from many common cognitive biases. These includes things like deferring too much to perceived authorities, and discussing topics that one likes, feels comfortable with or know many interesting facts about. It is possible that the kind of disciplining “skin in the game” effect we were hoping for failed to occur since the grant was altruistic, and of little relevance to team members personally. In response to this, team members also pledged a secret amount of their own money to the eventual recipient (with pledges ranging from £0 to £200)<a href=""#fn:comment""><sup>9</sup></a>. It is difficult to disentangle the consequences of this personal decision from the donation at large, but it might still have suffered the same altruistic problem. Given how insensitive people are to astronomical differences in charity impact in general, the choice of which top charity one’s donations go to might not make a sufficient psychological difference to offset other incentives.</p><p>Second, truth-seeking interaction is partly difficult not because of misaligned incentives, but because it requires certain mental skills that have to be deliberately trained (see also <a href=""#different-levels-of-previous-experience"">“Different levels of previous experience”</a>). Finding the truth, in general, is hard. For example, we strongly encouraged team members to center discussions around cruxes, but most often the cruxes members gave were not <i>actually</i> things that would change <i>their</i> minds about X, as opposed to generic evidence regarding X or evidence that would clearly falsify X but that they strongly never expected to be found. This was true for basically all members of the Project, often including ourselves.</p><p>Instead of the looming, large donation, the epistemic atmosphere seems to have been positively impacted by things like guiding disagreements in relation to which quantitative model input they would change, and working within a strict time limit (e.g. a set meeting ending). For more on this, see the section <a href=""#focus-on-quantitative-models-from-the-beginning"">“Focus on quantitative models from the beginning”</a>.</p><h2>A major risk to the project is people hold on too strongly to their pre-Project views</h2><p><strong>Update:</strong> lower credence</p><p>We nicknamed this the “pet charities” problem: participants start the project with some views about which grantees are most cost-effective, and see themselves as having to defend that view. They engage with contrary evidence, but only to argue against it, or to find some reason their original grantee is still superior.</p><p>This was hardly a problem, but something in the vicinity was. While people didn’t strongly defend a view, this was mostly because they didn’t feel comfortable engaging with competing views at all. Instead, participants strongly preferred to continue researching the area they already knew and cared most about, even as other participants were doing the same thing with a different area. Participants’ different choice of area implied disagreeing premises, but they proved extremely reluctant to attempt to resolve this disagreement. We might call this the “pet areas” problem or the problem of “lower bound propagation”. (Because participants may informally be using the heuristic: “consider only interventions better than X”, with very different Xs).</p><p>Another problem that proved bigger than pet charities was over-updating on authority opinion (such as Tom’s current ranking of grantees). We see this as linked with the lack of comfort or confidence mentioned above.</p><h2>A large majority of team applicants would be people we know personally.</h2><p><strong>Update:</strong> false</p><p>We’re both socially close to the EA community in Oxford. We expected to more or less know all applicants personally: if someone was interested enough in EA to apply, we would have come across them somehow.</p><p>Instead, a large number of applications were from people we didn’t know at all, a few of which ended up being selected for the team. We update that, at least in Oxford, there are many “lurkers”: people who are interested in EA, but find the current offerings of the local group uninspiring, so that they don’t get involved at all. There appear to be many talented people who are only prepared to work on an EA project if it stands out to them as particularly interesting. Although we generally would advise caution, this could be one reason to be more optimistic about replications of the Project.</p><hr><ol><li>A useful distinction is between ‘considerations’-type arguments and ‘weighing’-type arguments. Considerations-type arguments contain new facts or reasoning that should shift our views, other things being equal, in a certain direction. Sometimes, in addition to the direction of the shift, these arguments give an intuitive idea of its magnitude. Weighing-type arguments, on the other hand, take existing considerations and use them to arrive at an all-things-considered view. The magnitude of different effects is explicitly weighed. Considerations-type arguments involve fewer questionable judgement calls and more conceptual novelty, which is one reason we believe they are oversupplied relative to weighing-type arguments. While Tom believed this sufficiently strongly to contribute to motivating him to launch the Project, we both agree that this is something reasonable people can disagree about. On a draft of this piece, Max Dalton wrote: “They also tend to produce shifts in view that are less significant, both in the sense of less revolutionary, and in the sense of the changes tending to have less impact. This is partly because weighing-type arguments are more commonly used in cases where you’re picking between two good options. Because I think weighing-type arguments tend to be lower-impact, I’m not sure I agree with your conclusion. My view here is pretty low-resilience.”&nbsp;<a href=""#fnref:wc"">↩</a></li><li>To be clear, however, there are team members who are seriously considering that career path.&nbsp;<a href=""#fnref:car"">↩</a></li><li>Tom’s guess: 15% chance this person goes into prioritisation research. Conditional on him or her doing so, a ~30% chance we caused it.&nbsp;<a href=""#fnref:probguess"">↩</a></li><li>We also had a safeguard in place to avoid the money being granted to an obviously poor organisation, in case the project went dangerously off the rails: Owen Cotton-Barratt had veto power on the final grant (although he says he would have been reluctant to use it).&nbsp;<a href=""#fnref:owen"">↩</a></li><li>The Fermi question was too easy in that it didn’t help discriminate between top applicants, and that the research proposal question was too vague and should have required more specifics.&nbsp;<a href=""#fnref:applic"">↩</a></li><li>Jacob adds: “It should be emphasized that we are disregarding any general intellectual progress here. It is plausible that several team members learned new concepts and practiced critical thinking, and as a result grew intellectually from the project – just not in a direction and extent that would help with global prioritisation work in particular.”&nbsp;<a href=""#fnref:jac2"">↩</a></li><li>More goal flexibility, earlier on, would have been good. We had ambitious goals for the Project, which we described publicly online, and in conversations with funders and others we respect. In attempting to achieve these goals, we believe we were quite flexible and creative, trying many different approaches. But we were too rigid about the (ultimately instrumental) Project goals. Partly, we felt that changing them would be an embarrassment; we avoided doing so because it would have been painful in the short run. But it seems clear now that we could have better achieved our terminal goals by modifying the Project’s goals.&nbsp;<a href=""#fnref:goalflex"">↩</a></li><li>There is significant disagreement about this among people we’ve discussed it with, on and off the team. We note that being more heavily involved in the Project seems to correlate with believing that a low grant would have achieved most of the benefits. Outsiders tend to believe that more money is good, while we who led the Project believe the effects are small. (A middle ground of £5000 has tended to produce some more agreement.) People we respect disagree with us, which you should take into account when forming your own view.&nbsp;<a href=""#fnref:disag"">↩</a></li><li>Jacob adds: “One of our most productive and insightful sessions was when we spent about six hours deciding the final inputs into the models. It is plausible that this single session was equally intellectually productive and decision-guiding as the first few weeks of the project combined.”&nbsp;<a href=""#fnref:jac"">↩</a></li><li>A team member comments that “skin in the game”-effects may encourage avoiding bad outcomes more than working extra hard for good outcomes: “Subjectively, I felt it as a constant ‘safety net’ to know that we’d most likely give to a good charity that ends up being in a certain range of uncertainty that the experts concede, and that it was almost impossible for us to blow 10,000GBP on something that would be anywhere near low impact”.&nbsp;<a href=""#fnref:comment"">↩</a></li></ol><p>Written on October 12, 2017</p>",tommsittler,tommsittler,[deleted],

However if you think your conversational partner is annoyingly pointing out a rare exception, double-check in case <em>they</em> think they are pointing out a common exception.<br/>------<br/>Human space is deep and wide, and there is a lot more variation in humanity than we really give credit to. This means that for almost any generalization you can make about people, there exists exceptions to the rule.</p><p>One rhetorical trick people sometimes use is to point out rare exceptions when the discussion is focusing on generalizations. For example, let&#x27;s say Alice argues that five year olds shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to vote because they aren&#x27;t mature enough or knowledgeable enough. Bob replies &quot;Some five year olds are more mature and knowledgeable than some thirty year olds.&quot;</p><p>Well... it&#x27;s strictly <em>true</em>, in that there are some five year old prodigies that you could compare against some non-functional adults in a vegetative state. But it isn&#x27;t really helpful to the conversation, and it tends to be derailing. This is a case where you are searching all of human-space to find your 0.001% exception and then going &quot;AHA!&quot;<br/><br/>However, there are also times when there are <em>many</em> people who fall outside the norm, and pointing out the exceptions is useful. If Clair says they don&#x27;t use women to stock shelves because women aren&#x27;t tall enough to reach the top shelf, and Derek points out &quot;Some women are taller than the average man,&quot; this seems very different than the previous example. It would be rare to find a five year old that is more mature than a thirty-five year old, but not at all particularly rare to find a woman who is taller than a man (even though on average men are taller).<br/><br/>I think sometimes misunderstandings occur when one person thinks they&#x27;re pointing out a common exception, and their conversational partner thinks they are pointing out a rare exception. Maybe Bob really thinks that something like 10% of five-year-olds are more knowledgeable than about 10% of adults. If Alice assumes Bob is just pointing out the 0.001% exceptions that always exist in all human things ever, she is going to be more likely to assume Bob is arguing in bad faith, and miss out on finding their true disagreement.<br/><br/>(I am bad at naming things, if anyone has an idea for what to call it when you point out a 0.001% exception.)<br/><br/></p></div></div></div></div>",weft,weft,weft,

Five out of the eight groups didn&#x27;t react or report the smoke, even as it became dense enough to make them start coughing. Subsequent manipulations showed that a lone student will respond 75% of the time; while a student accompanied by two actors told to feign apathy will respond only 10% of the time. This and other experiments seemed to pin down that what&#x27;s happening is pluralistic ignorance. We don&#x27;t want to look panicky by being afraid of what isn&#x27;t an emergency, so we try to look calm while glancing out of the corners of our eyes to see how others are reacting, but of course they are also trying to look calm.</p><p>(I&#x27;ve read a number of replications and variations on this research, and the effect size is blatant. I would not expect this to be one of the results that dies to the replication crisis, and I haven&#x27;t yet heard about the replication crisis touching it. But we have to put a maybe-not marker on everything now.)</p><p>A fire alarm creates common knowledge, in the you-know-I-know sense, that there is a fire; after which it is socially safe to react. When the fire alarm goes off, you know that everyone else knows there is a fire, you know you won&#x27;t lose face if you proceed to exit the building. </p><p>The fire alarm doesn&#x27;t tell us with certainty that a fire is there. In fact, I can&#x27;t recall one time in my life when, exiting a building on a fire alarm, there was an actual fire.  Really, a fire alarm is <em>weaker</em> evidence of fire than smoke coming from under a door. </p><p>But the fire alarm tells us that it&#x27;s socially okay to react to the fire. It promises us with certainty that we won&#x27;t be embarrassed if we now proceed to exit in an orderly fashion.</p><p>It seems to me that this is one of the cases where people have mistaken beliefs about what they believe, like when somebody loudly endorsing their city&#x27;s team to win the big game will back down as soon as asked to bet. They haven&#x27;t consciously distinguished the rewarding exhilaration of shouting that the team will win, from the feeling of anticipating the team will win.</p><p>When people look at the smoke coming from under the door, I think they think their uncertain wobbling feeling comes from not assigning the fire a high-enough probability of really being there, and that they&#x27;re reluctant to act for fear of wasting effort and time. If so, I think they&#x27;re interpreting their own feelings mistakenly. If that was so, they&#x27;d get the same wobbly feeling on hearing the fire alarm, or even more so, because fire alarms correlate to fire less than does smoke coming from under a door. The uncertain wobbling feeling comes from the worry that others believe differently, not the worry that the fire isn&#x27;t there. The reluctance to act is the reluctance to be seen looking foolish, not the reluctance to waste effort. That&#x27;s why the student alone in the room does something about the fire 75% of the time, and why people have no trouble reacting to the much weaker evidence presented by fire alarms.</p><p></p><p style=""text-align:center;"">* * *</p><p style=""text-align:center;""></p><p>It&#x27;s now and then proposed that we ought to start reacting later to the issues of Artificial General Intelligence (<a href=""http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2016/03/so_far_unfriend.html"">background here</a>), because, it is said, we are so far away from it that it just isn&#x27;t possible to do productive work on it today. </p><p>(For direct argument about there being things doable today, see: Soares and Fallenstein (<a href=""https://intelligence.org/files/TechnicalAgenda.pdf"">2014/2017</a>); Amodei, Olah, Steinhardt, Christiano, Schulman, and Mané (<a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06565"">2016</a>); or Taylor, Yudkowsky, LaVictoire, and Critch (<a href=""https://intelligence.org/2017/02/28/using-machine-learning/"">2016</a>).)</p><p>(If none of those papers existed or if you were an AI researcher who&#x27;d read them but thought they were all garbage, and you wished you could work on alignment but knew of nothing you could do, the wise next step would be to sit down and spend two hours by the clock sincerely trying to think of possible approaches. Preferably without self-sabotage that makes sure you don&#x27;t come up with anything plausible; as might happen if, hypothetically speaking, you would actually find it much more comfortable to believe there was nothing you ought to be working on today, because e.g. then you could work on other things that interested you more.)</p><p>(But never mind.)</p><p>So if AGI seems far-ish away, and you think the conclusion licensed by this is that you can&#x27;t do any productive work on AGI alignment yet, then the implicit alternative strategy on offer is: Wait for some unspecified future event that tells us AGI is coming near; and <em>then</em> we&#x27;ll all know that it&#x27;s okay to start working on AGI alignment.</p><p>This seems to me to be wrong on a number of grounds. Here are some of them.</p><p><strong>One:</strong> As Stuart Russell observed, if you get radio signals from space and spot a spaceship there with your telescopes and you know the aliens are landing in thirty years, you still start thinking about that today.</p><p>You&#x27;re not like, &quot;Meh, that&#x27;s thirty years off, whatever.&quot; You certainly don&#x27;t casually say &quot;Well, there&#x27;s nothing we can do until they&#x27;re closer.&quot;  Not without spending two hours, or at least <a href=""http://www.readthesequences.com/MotivatedStoppingAndMotivatedContinuation"">five minutes</a> by the clock, brainstorming about whether there is anything you ought to be starting now.</p><p>If you said the aliens were coming in thirty years and you were therefore going to do nothing today... well, if these were <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/yudkowsky/posts/10155616782514228"">more effective time</a>s, somebody would ask for a schedule of what you thought ought to be done, starting when, how long before the aliens arrive. If you didn&#x27;t have that schedule ready, they&#x27;d know that you weren&#x27;t operating according to a worked table of timed responses, but just procrastinating and doing nothing; and they&#x27;d correctly infer that you probably hadn&#x27;t searched very hard for things that could be done today.</p><p>In Bryan Caplan&#x27;s terms, anyone who seems quite casual about the fact that &quot;nothing can be done now to prepare&quot; about the aliens is <a href=""http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2016/01/the_invisible_t.html"">missing a mood</a>; they should be much more alarmed at not being able to think of any way to prepare. And maybe ask if somebody else has come up with any ideas? But never mind.</p><p><strong>Two:</strong> History shows that for the general public, and even for scientists not in a key inner circle, and even for scientists <em>in</em> that key circle, it is very often the case that key technological developments still seem decades away, five years before they show up.</p><p>In 1901, two years before helping build the first heavier-than-air flyer, Wilbur Wright told his brother that powered flight was <a href=""https://books.google.com/books?id=ldxfLyNIk9wC&amp;pg=PA91&amp;dq=&quot;i+said+to+my+brother+orville&quot;&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwioiseChcnWAhWL-VQKHab6AqMQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22i%20said%20to%20my%20brother%20orville%22&amp;f=false"">fifty years away</a>.</p><p>In 1939, three years before he personally oversaw the first critical chain reaction in a pile of uranium bricks, Enrico Fermi voiced <a href=""https://books.google.com/books?id=aSgFMMNQ6G4C&amp;pg=PA813&amp;lpg=PA813&amp;dq=weart+fermi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Jy1pBOUL10&amp;sig=c9wK_yLHbXZS_GFIv0K3bgpmE58&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjNofKsisnWAhXGlFQKHbOSB1QQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22ten%20per%20cent%22&amp;f=false"">90% confidence</a> that it was <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/h8m/being_halfrational_about_pascals_wager_is_even/"">impossible</a> to use uranium to sustain a fission chain reaction. I believe Fermi also said a year after that, aka two years before the denouement, that <em>if</em> net power from fission was even possible (as he then granted some greater plausibility) then it would be fifty years off; but for this I neglected to keep the citation.</p><p>And of course if you&#x27;re not the Wright Brothers or Enrico Fermi, you will be even more surprised. Most of the world learned that atomic weapons were now a thing when they woke up to the headlines about Hiroshima. There were esteemed intellectuals saying <a href=""https://www.xaprb.com/blog/flight-is-impossible/"">four years <em>after</em> the Wright Flyer</a> that heavier-than-air flight was impossible, because knowledge propagated more slowly back then.</p><p>Were there events that, in <a href=""https://www.readthesequences.com/Hindsight-Devalues-Science"">hindsight</a>, today, we can see as signs that heavier-than-air flight or nuclear energy were nearing?  Sure, but if you go back and read the actual newspapers from that time and see what people actually said about it then, you&#x27;ll see that they did not know that these were signs, or that they were very uncertain that these might be signs.  Some playing the part of Excited Futurists proclaimed that big changes were imminent, I expect, and others playing the part of Sober Scientists tried to pour cold water on all that childish enthusiasm; I expect that part was more or less exactly the same decades earlier.  If somewhere in that din was a superforecaster who said &quot;decades&quot; when it was decades and &quot;5 years&quot; when it was five, good luck noticing them amid all the noise.  More likely, the superforecasters were the ones who said &quot;Could be tomorrow, could be decades&quot; both when the big development was a day away and when it was decades away.</p><p>One of the major modes by which hindsight bias makes us feel that the past was more predictable than anyone was actually able to predict at the time, is that in hindsight we know what we ought to notice, and we fixate on only one thought as to what each piece of evidence indicates.  If you look at what people actually say at the time, historically, they&#x27;ve usually got no clue what&#x27;s about to happen three months before it happens, because they don&#x27;t know which signs are which.</p><p>I mean, you <em>could</em> say the words “AGI is 50 years away” and have those words happen to be true. People were also saying that powered flight was decades away when it was in fact decades away, and those people happened to be right. The problem is that everything looks the same to you either way, if you are actually living history instead of reading about it afterwards.</p><p>It&#x27;s not that whenever somebody says &quot;fifty years&quot; the thing always happens in two years.  It&#x27;s that this confident prediction of things being far away corresponds to an epistemic state about the technology that feels the same way internally until you are very very close to the big development. It&#x27;s the epistemic state of &quot;Well, I don&#x27;t see how to do the thing&quot; and sometimes you say that fifty years off from the big development, and sometimes you say it two years away, and sometimes you say it while the Wright Flyer is flying somewhere out of your sight.</p><p><strong>Three:</strong> Progress is driven by peak knowledge, not average knowledge.</p><p>If Fermi and the Wrights couldn&#x27;t see it coming three years out, imagine how hard it must be for anyone else to see it.</p><p>If you&#x27;re not at the global peak of knowledge of how to do the thing, and looped in on all the progress being made at what will turn out to be the leading project, you aren&#x27;t going to be able to see of your own knowledge <em>at all</em> that the big development is imminent. Unless you are very good at perspective-taking in a way that wasn&#x27;t necessary in a hunter-gatherer tribe, and very good at realizing that other people may know techniques and ideas of which you have no inkling even that you do not know them. If you don&#x27;t consciously compensate for the lessons of history in this regard; then you will promptly say the decades-off thing.  Fermi wasn&#x27;t still thinking that net nuclear energy was impossible or decades away by the time he got to 3 months before he built the first pile, because at that point Fermi was looped in on everything and saw how to do it.  But anyone not looped in probably still felt like it was fifty years away while the actual pile was fizzing away in a squash court at the University of Chicago.</p><p>People don&#x27;t seem to automatically compensate for the fact that the timing of the big development is a function of the peak knowledge in the field, a threshold touched by the people who know the most and have the best ideas; while they themselves have average knowledge; and therefore what they themselves know is not strong evidence about when the big development happens.  I think they aren&#x27;t thinking about that at all, and they just eyeball it using their own sense of difficulty.  If they are thinking anything more deliberate and reflective than that, and incorporating real work into correcting for the factors that might bias their lenses, they haven&#x27;t bothered writing down their reasoning anywhere I can read it.</p><p>To know that AGI is decades away, we would need enough understanding of AGI to know what pieces of the puzzle are missing, and how hard these pieces are to obtain; and that kind of insight is unlikely to be available until the puzzle is complete.  Which is also to say that to anyone outside the leading edge, the puzzle will look more incomplete than it looks on the edge.  That project may publish their theories in advance of proving them, although I hope not.  But there are unproven theories now too.</p><p>And again, that&#x27;s not to say that people saying &quot;fifty years&quot; is a certain sign that something is happening in a squash court; they were saying “fifty years” sixty years ago too.  It&#x27;s saying that anyone who thinks technological <em>timelines</em> are actually forecastable, in advance, by people who are not looped in to the leading project&#x27;s progress reports and who don&#x27;t share all the best ideas about exactly how to do the thing and how much effort is required for that, is learning the wrong lesson from history. In particular, from reading history books that neatly lay out lines of progress and their visible signs that we all know <em>now</em> were important and evidential. It&#x27;s sometimes possible to say useful conditional things about the consequences of the big development whenever it happens, but it’s rarely possible to make confident predictions about the <em>timing</em> of those developments, beyond a one- or two-year horizon.  And if you are one of the rare people who can call the timing, if people like that even exist, nobody else knows to pay attention to you and not to the Excited Futurists or Sober Skeptics.</p><p><strong>Four:</strong> The future uses different tools, and can therefore easily do things that are very hard now, or do with difficulty things that are impossible now.</p><p>Why do we know that AGI is decades away? In popular articles penned by heads of AI research labs and the like, there are typically three prominent reasons given:</p><p>(A) The author does not know how to build AGI using present technology. The author does not know where to start.</p><p>(B) The author thinks it is really very hard to do the impressive things that modern AI technology does, they have to slave long hours over a hot GPU farm tweaking hyperparameters to get it done. They think that the public does not appreciate how hard it is to get anything done right now, and is panicking prematurely because the public thinks anyone can just fire up Tensorflow and build a robotic car.</p><p>(C) The author spends a lot of time interacting with AI systems and therefore is able to personally appreciate all the ways in which they are still stupid and lack common sense.</p><p>We&#x27;ve now considered some aspects of argument A.  Let&#x27;s consider argument B for a moment.</p><p>Suppose I say: &quot;It is now possible for one comp-sci grad to do in a week anything that N+ years ago the research community could do with neural networks <em>at all</em>.&quot; How large is N?</p><p>I got some answers to this on Twitter from people whose credentials I don&#x27;t know, but the most common answer was five, which sounds about right to me based on my own acquaintance with machine learning.  (Though obviously not as a literal universal, because reality is never that neat.) If you could do something in 2012 period, you can probably do it fairly straightforwardly with modern GPUs, Tensorflow, Xavier initialization, batch normalization, ReLUs, and Adam or RMSprop or just stochastic gradient descent with momentum. The modern techniques are just that much better.  To be sure, there are things we can&#x27;t do now with just those simple methods, things that require tons more work, but those things were not possible at all in 2012.</p><p>In machine learning, when you can do something at all, you are probably at most a few years away from being able to do it easily using the future&#x27;s much superior tools. From this standpoint, argument B, &quot;You don&#x27;t understand how hard it is to do what we do,&quot; is something of a non-sequitur when it comes to timing.</p><p>Statement B sounds to me like the same sentiment voiced by Rutherford <a href=""https://www.edge.org/conversation/the-myth-of-ai#26015"">in 1933</a> when he called net energy from atomic fission &quot;moonshine&quot;. If you were a nuclear physicist in 1933 then you had to split all your atoms by hand, by bombarding them with other particles, and it was a laborious business. If somebody talked about getting net energy from atoms, maybe it made you feel that you were unappreciated, that people thought your job was easy.</p><p>But of course this will always be the lived experience for AI engineers on serious frontier projects. You don&#x27;t get paid big bucks to do what a grad student can do in a week (unless you&#x27;re working for a bureaucracy with no clue about AI; but that&#x27;s not Google or FB). Your personal experience will <em>always</em> be that what you are paid to spend months doing is difficult. A change in this personal experience is therefore not something you can use as a fire alarm.</p><p>Those playing the part of wiser sober skeptical scientists would obviously agree in the abstract that our tools will improve; but in the popular articles they pen, they just talk about the painstaking difficulty of this year&#x27;s tools. I think that when they&#x27;re in that mode they are not even trying to forecast what the tools will be like in 5 years; they haven&#x27;t written down any such arguments as part of the articles I&#x27;ve read. I think that when they tell you that AGI is decades off, they are literally giving an estimate of <a href=""https://www.readthesequences.com/UnboundedScalesHugeJuryAwardsAndFuturism"">how long it feels to them</a> like it would take to build AGI using their current tools and knowledge. Which is why they emphasize how hard it is to stir the heap of linear algebra until it spits out good answers; I think they are not imagining, at all, into how this experience may change over considerably less than fifty years. If they&#x27;ve explicitly considered the bias of estimating future tech timelines based on their present subjective sense of difficulty, and tried to compensate for that bias, they haven&#x27;t written that reasoning down anywhere I&#x27;ve read it. Nor have I ever heard of that forecasting method giving good results historically.</p><p><strong>Five:</strong> Okay, let&#x27;s be blunt here. I don&#x27;t think most of the discourse about AGI being far away (<em>or</em> that it&#x27;s near) is being generated by models of future progress in machine learning. I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re looking at wrong models; I think we&#x27;re looking at no models.</p><p>I was once at a conference where there was a panel full of famous AI luminaries, and most of the luminaries were nodding and agreeing with each other that of course AGI was very far off, except for two famous AI luminaries who stayed quiet and let others take the microphone.</p><p>I got up in Q&amp;A and said, &quot;Okay, you&#x27;ve all told us that progress won&#x27;t be all that fast.  But let&#x27;s be more concrete and specific.  I&#x27;d like to know what&#x27;s the <em>least</em> impressive accomplishment that you are very confident <em>cannot</em> be done in the next two years.&quot;</p><p>There was a silence.</p><p>Eventually, two people on the panel ventured replies, spoken in a rather more tentative tone than they&#x27;d been using to pronounce that AGI was decades out.  They named &quot;A robot puts away the dishes from a dishwasher without breaking them&quot;, and <a href=""http://www.cs.nyu.edu/faculty/davise/papers/WinogradSchemas/WS.html"">Winograd schemas</a>.  Specifically, &quot;I feel quite confident that the Winograd schemas--where we recently had a result that was in the 50, 60% range--in the next two years, we will not get 80, 90% on that regardless of the techniques people use.&quot;</p><p>A few months after that panel, there was unexpectedly a big breakthrough on Winograd schemas.  The breakthrough didn&#x27;t crack 80%, so three cheers for wide credibility intervals with error margin, but I expect the predictor might be feeling slightly more nervous now with one year left to go.  (I don&#x27;t think it was the breakthrough I remember reading about, but Rob turned up <a href=""https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/0326.pdf"">this paper</a> as an example of one that could have been submitted at most 44 days after the above conference and gets up to 70%.)</p><p>But that&#x27;s not the point.  The point is the silence that fell after my question, and that eventually I only got two replies, spoken in tentative tones.  When I asked for concrete feats that were impossible in the next two years, I think that that&#x27;s when the luminaries on that panel switched to trying to build a mental model of future progress in machine learning, asking themselves what they could or couldn&#x27;t predict, what they knew or didn&#x27;t know.  And to their credit, most of them did know their profession well enough to realize that forecasting future boundaries around a rapidly moving field is actually <em>really hard</em>, that nobody knows what will appear on arXiv next month, and that they needed to put wide credibility intervals with very generous upper bounds on how much progress might take place twenty-four months&#x27; worth of arXiv papers later.</p><p>(Also, Demis Hassabis was present, so they all knew that if they named something insufficiently impossible, Demis would have DeepMind go and do it.)</p><p>The question I asked was in a completely different genre from the panel discussion, requiring a mental context switch: the assembled luminaries actually had to try to consult their rough, scarce-formed intuitive models of progress in machine learning and figure out what future experiences, if any, their model of the field definitely prohibited within a two-year time horizon.  Instead of, well, emitting socially desirable verbal behavior meant to kill that darned hype about AGI and get some predictable applause from the audience.</p><p>I&#x27;ll be blunt: I don&#x27;t think the confident long-termism has been thought out at all.  If your model has the extraordinary power to say what will be impossible in ten years after another one hundred and twenty months of arXiv papers, then you ought to be able to say much weaker things that are impossible in two years, and you should have those predictions queued up and ready to go rather than falling into nervous silence after being asked.</p><p>In reality, the two-year problem is hard and the ten-year problem is laughably hard.  The future is hard to predict in general, our predictive grasp on a rapidly changing and advancing field of science and engineering is very weak indeed, and it doesn&#x27;t permit narrow credible intervals on what can&#x27;t be done.</p><p>Grace et al. (<a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08807"">2017</a>) surveyed the predictions of 352 presenters at ICML and NIPS 2015. Respondents’ aggregate forecast was that the proposition “all occupations are fully automatable” (in the sense that “for any occupation, machines could be built to carry out the task better and more cheaply than human workers”) will not reach 50% probability until 121 years hence. Except that a randomized subset of respondents were instead asked the slightly different question of “when unaided machines can accomplish every task better and more cheaply than human workers”, and in this case held that this was 50% likely to occur <a href=""http://www.bayesianinvestor.com/blog/index.php/2017/06/01/do-ai-experts-exist/"">within 44 years</a>.</p><p>That&#x27;s what happens when you ask people to produce an estimate they can&#x27;t estimate, and there&#x27;s a social sense of what the desirable verbal behavior is supposed to be.</p><p style=""text-align:center;"">* * *</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">When I observe that there&#x27;s no fire alarm for AGI, I&#x27;m not saying that there&#x27;s no possible equivalent of smoke appearing from under a door.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">What I&#x27;m saying rather is that the smoke under the door is always going to be arguable; it is not going to be a clear and undeniable and absolute sign of fire; and so there is never going to be a fire alarm producing common knowledge that action is now due and socially acceptable.</p><p>There&#x27;s an old trope saying that as soon as something is actually done, it ceases to be called AI. People who work in AI and are in a broad sense pro-accelerationist and techno-enthusiast, what you might call the Kurzweilian camp (of which I am not a member), will sometimes rail against this as unfairness in judgment, as moving goalposts.</p><p>This overlooks a real and important phenomenon of adverse selection against AI accomplishments: If you can do something impressive-sounding with AI in 1974, then that is because that thing turned out to be doable in some cheap cheaty way, not because 1974 was so amazingly great at AI.  We are uncertain about how much cognitive effort it takes to perform tasks, and how easy it is to cheat at them, and the first &quot;impressive&quot; tasks to be accomplished will be those where we were most wrong about how much effort was required. There was a time when some people thought that a computer winning the world chess championship would require progress in the direction of AGI, and that this would count as a sign that AGI was getting closer.  When Deep Blue beat Kasparov in 1997, in a Bayesian sense we did learn something about progress in AI, but we also learned something about chess being easy. Considering the techniques used to construct Deep Blue, most of what we learned was &quot;It is surprisingly possible to play chess without easy-to-generalize techniques&quot; and not much &quot;A surprising amount of progress has been made toward AGI.&quot;</p><p>Was AlphaGo smoke under the door, a sign of AGI in 10 years or less? People had previously given Go as an example of What You See Before The End.</p><p>Looking over the paper describing AlphaGo&#x27;s architecture, it seemed to me that we <em>were</em> mostly learning that available AI techniques were likely to go further towards generality than expected, rather than about Go being surprisingly easy to achieve with fairly narrow and ad-hoc approaches. Not that the method scales to AGI, obviously; but AlphaGo did look like a product of <em>relatively</em> general insights and techniques being turned on the special case of Go, in a way that Deep Blue wasn’t.  I also updated significantly on &quot;The general learning capabilities of the human cortical algorithm are less impressive, less difficult to capture with a ton of gradient descent and a zillion GPUs, than I thought,&quot; because if there were anywhere we expected an impressive hard-to-match highly-natural-selected but-still-general cortical algorithm to come into play, it would be in humans playing Go.</p><p>Maybe if we&#x27;d seen a thousand Earths undergoing similar events, we&#x27;d gather the statistics and find that a computer winning the planetary Go championship is a reliable ten-year-harbinger of AGI. But I don&#x27;t actually know that. Neither do you. Certainly, anyone can publicly argue that we just learned Go was easier to achieve with strictly narrow techniques than expected, as was true many times in the past. There&#x27;s no possible sign short of actual AGI, no case of smoke from under the door, for which we know that this is definitely serious fire and now AGI is 10, 5, or 2 years away. Let alone a sign where we know everyone else will believe it.</p><p>And in any case, multiple leading scientists in machine learning have already published articles telling us their criterion for a fire alarm. They will believe Artificial General Intelligence is imminent:</p><p>(A) When they personally see how to construct AGI using their current tools. This is what they are always saying is not currently true in order to castigate the folly of those who think AGI might be near.</p><p>(B) When their personal jobs do not give them a sense of everything being difficult. This, they are at pains to say, is a key piece of knowledge not possessed by the ignorant layfolk who think AGI might be near, who only believe that because they have never stayed up until 2AM trying to get a generative adversarial network to stabilize.</p><p>(C) When they are very impressed by how smart their AI is relative to a human being in respects that still feel magical to them; as opposed to the parts they do know how to engineer, which no longer seem magical to them; aka the AI seeming pretty smart in interaction and conversation; aka the AI actually being an AGI already.</p><p>So there isn&#x27;t going to be a fire alarm. Period.</p><p>There is never going to be a time before the end when you can look around nervously, and see that it is now clearly common knowledge that you can talk about AGI being imminent, and take action and exit the building in an orderly fashion, without fear of looking stupid or frightened.</p><p style=""text-align:center;"">* * *</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">So far as I can presently estimate, now that we&#x27;ve had AlphaGo and a couple of other maybe/maybe-not shots across the bow, and seen a huge explosion of effort invested into machine learning and an enormous flood of papers, we are probably going to occupy our present epistemic state until very near the end.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">By saying we&#x27;re probably going to be in roughly this epistemic state until almost the end, I <em>don&#x27;t</em> mean to say we know that AGI is imminent, or that there won&#x27;t be important new breakthroughs in AI in the intervening time. I mean that it&#x27;s hard to guess how many further insights are needed for AGI, or how long it will take to reach those insights. After the next breakthrough, we still won&#x27;t know how many more breakthroughs are needed, leaving us in pretty much the same epistemic state as before. Whatever discoveries and milestones come next, it will probably continue to be hard to guess how many further insights are needed, and timelines will continue to be similarly murky. Maybe researcher enthusiasm and funding will rise further, and we&#x27;ll be able to say that timelines are shortening; or maybe we’ll hit another AI winter, and we&#x27;ll know that&#x27;s a sign indicating that things will take longer than they would otherwise; but we still won&#x27;t know <em>how long.</em></p><p>At some point we might see a sudden flood of arXiv papers in which really interesting and fundamental and scary cognitive challenges seem to be getting done at an increasing pace. Whereupon, as this flood accelerates, even some who imagine themselves sober and skeptical will be unnerved to the point that they venture that perhaps AGI is only 15 years away now, maybe, possibly. The signs might become so blatant, very soon before the end, that people start thinking it is socially acceptable to say that maybe AGI is 10 years off.  Though the signs would have to be pretty darned blatant, if they’re to overcome the social barrier posed by luminaries who are estimating arrival times to AGI using their personal knowledge and personal difficulties, as well as all the historical bad feelings about AI winters caused by hype.</p><p>But even if it becomes socially acceptable to say that AGI is 15 years out, in those last couple of years or months, I would still expect there to be disagreement. There will still be others protesting that, as much as associative memory and human-equivalent cerebellar coordination (or whatever) are now solved problems, they still don&#x27;t know how to construct AGI. They will note that there are no AIs writing computer science papers, or holding a truly sensible conversation with a human, and castigate the senseless alarmism of those who talk as if we already knew how to do that. They will explain that foolish laypeople don&#x27;t realize how much pain and tweaking it takes to get the current systems to work.  (Although those modern methods can easily do almost anything that was possible in 2017, and any grad student knows how to roll a stable GAN on the first try using the tf.unsupervised module in Tensorflow 5.3.1.)</p><p>When all the pieces are ready and in place, lacking only the last piece to be assembled by the very peak of knowledge and creativity across the whole world, it will still seem to the average ML person that AGI is an enormous challenge looming in the distance, because they still won’t personally know how to construct an AGI system. Prestigious heads of major AI research groups will still be writing <a href=""https://www.technologyreview.com/s/608986/forget-killer-robotsbias-is-the-real-ai-danger/"">articles</a> decrying the folly of fretting about the total destruction of all Earthly life and all future value it could have achieved, and saying that we should not let this distract us from <em>real, respectable concerns</em> like loan-approval systems accidentally absorbing human biases.</p><p>Of course, the future is very hard to predict in detail. It&#x27;s so hard that not only do I confess my own inability, I make the far stronger positive statement that nobody else can do it either. The “flood of groundbreaking arXiv papers” scenario is one way things could maybe possibly go, but it&#x27;s an implausibly specific scenario that I made up for the sake of concreteness. It&#x27;s certainly not based on my extensive experience watching other Earthlike civilizations develop AGI. I do put a significant chunk of probability mass on &quot;There&#x27;s not much sign visible outside a Manhattan Project until Hiroshima,&quot; because that scenario is simple. Anything more complex is just one more story full of <a href=""https://www.readthesequences.com/Burdensome-Details"">burdensome details</a> that aren&#x27;t likely to all be true.</p><p>But no matter how the details play out, I do predict in a very general sense that there will be no fire alarm that is not an actual running AGI--no unmistakable sign before then that everyone knows and agrees on, that lets people act without feeling nervous about whether they&#x27;re worrying too early. That&#x27;s just not how the history of technology has usually played out in much simpler cases like flight and nuclear engineering, let alone a case like this one where all the signs and models are disputed. We already know enough about the uncertainty and low quality of discussion surrounding this topic to be able to say with confidence that there will be no unarguable socially accepted sign of AGI arriving 10 years, 5 years, or 2 years beforehand. If there’s any general social panic it will be by coincidence, based on terrible reasoning, uncorrelated with real timelines except by total coincidence, set off by a Hollywood movie, and focused on relatively trivial dangers.</p><p>It&#x27;s no coincidence that nobody has given any actual account of such a fire alarm, and argued convincingly about how much time it means we have left, and what projects we should only then start.  If anyone does write that proposal, the next person to write one will say something completely different.  And probably neither of them will succeed at convincing me that they know anything prophetic about timelines, or that they&#x27;ve identified any sensible angle of attack that is (a) worth pursuing at all and (b) not worth starting to work on right now.</p><p style=""text-align:center;"">* * *</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">It seems to me that the decision to delay all action until a nebulous totally unspecified future alarm goes off, implies an order of recklessness great enough that the law of continued failure comes into play.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">The law of continued failure is the rule that says that if your country is incompetent enough to use a plaintext 9-numeric-digit password on all of your bank accounts and credit applications, your country is not competent enough to correct course after the next disaster in which a hundred million passwords are revealed.  A civilization competent enough to correct course in response to that prod, to react to it the way you&#x27;d want them to react, is competent enough not to make the mistake in the first place. When a system fails massively and obviously, rather than subtly and at the very edges of competence, the next prod is not going to cause the system to suddenly snap into doing things intelligently.</p><p>The law of continued failure is especially important to keep in mind when you are dealing with big powerful systems or high-status people that you might feel nervous about derogating, because you may be tempted to say, &quot;Well, it&#x27;s flawed now, but as soon as a future prod comes along, everything will snap into place and everything will be all right.&quot; The systems about which this fond hope is actually warranted look like they are mostly doing all the important things right already, and only failing in one or two steps of cognition.  The fond hope is almost never warranted when a person or organization or government or social subsystem is currently falling massively short.</p><p>The folly required to ignore the prospect of aliens landing in thirty years is already great enough that the other flawed elements of the debate should come as no surprise.</p><p>And with all of that going wrong simultaneously today, we should predict that the same system and incentives won&#x27;t produce correct outputs after receiving an uncertain sign that maybe the aliens are landing in five years instead. The law of continued failure suggests that if existing authorities failed in enough different ways at once to think that it makes sense to try to derail a conversation about existential risk by saying the real problem is the security on self-driving cars, the default expectation is that they will still be saying silly things later.</p><p>People who make large numbers of simultaneous mistakes don’t generally have all of the incorrect thoughts subconsciously labeled as &quot;incorrect&quot; in their heads.  Even when motivated, they can&#x27;t suddenly flip to skillfully executing all-correct reasoning steps instead. Yes, we have various experiments showing that monetary incentives can reduce overconfidence and political bias, but (a) that&#x27;s reduction rather than elimination, (b) it&#x27;s with extremely clear short-term direct incentives, not the nebulous and politicizable incentive of &quot;a lot being at stake&quot;, and (c) that doesn&#x27;t mean a switch is flipping all the way to &quot;carry out complicated correct reasoning&quot;.  If someone&#x27;s brain contains a switch that can flip to enable complicated correct reasoning at all, it&#x27;s got enough internal precision and skill to think mostly-correct thoughts now instead of later--at least to the degree that some conservatism and double-checking gets built into examining the conclusions that people know will get them killed if they’re wrong about them.</p><p>There is no sign and portent, <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/hp5/after_critical_event_w_happens_they_still_wont/"">no threshold crossed</a>, that suddenly causes people to wake up and start doing things systematically correctly. People who can react that competently to any sign at all, let alone a less-than-perfectly-certain not-totally-agreed item of evidence that is <em>likely</em> a wakeup call, have probably already done the timebinding thing.  They&#x27;ve already imagined the future sign coming, and gone ahead and thought sensible thoughts earlier, like Stuart Russell saying, &quot;If you know the aliens are landing in thirty years, it&#x27;s still a big deal now.&quot;</p><p style=""text-align:center;"">* * *</p><p>Back in the funding-starved early days of what is now MIRI, I learned that people who donated last year were likely to donate this year, and people who last year were planning to donate &quot;next year&quot; would quite often this year be planning to donate &quot;next year&quot;. Of course there were genuine transitions from zero to one; everything that happens needs to happen for a first time. There were college students who said &quot;later&quot; and gave nothing for a long time in a genuinely strategically wise way, and went on to get nice jobs and start donating. But I also learned well that, like many cheap and easy solaces, saying the word &quot;later&quot; is addictive; and that this luxury is available to the rich as well as the poor.</p><p>I don&#x27;t expect it to be any different with AGI alignment work. People who are trying to get what grasp they can on the alignment problem will, in the next year, be doing a little (or a lot) better with whatever they grasped in the previous year (plus, yes, any general-field advances that have taken place in the meantime). People who want to defer that until after there&#x27;s a better understanding of AI and AGI will, after the next year&#x27;s worth of advancements in AI and AGI, want to defer work until a better future understanding of AI and AGI.</p><p>Some people really <em>want</em> alignment to <em>get done</em> and are therefore <em>now</em> trying to wrack their brains about how to get something like a reinforcement learner to <a href=""https://arbital.com/p/pointing_finger/"">reliably identify a utility function over particular elements in a model of the causal environment instead of a sensory reward term</a> or <a href=""https://arbital.com/p/updated_deference/"">defeat the seeming tautologicalness of updated (non-)deference</a>. Others would rather be working on other things, and will therefore declare that there is no work that can possibly be done today, <em>not</em> spending two hours quietly thinking about it first before making that declaration. And this will not change tomorrow, unless perhaps tomorrow is when we wake up to some interesting newspaper headlines, and probably not even then. The luxury of saying &quot;later&quot; is not available only to the truly poor-in-available-options.</p><p>After a while, I started telling effective altruists in college: &quot;If you&#x27;re planning to earn-to-give later, then for now, give around $5 every three months. And never give exactly the same amount twice in a row, or give to the same organization twice in a row, so that you practice the mental habit of re-evaluating causes and re-evaluating your donation amounts on a regular basis. <em>Don&#x27;t</em> learn the mental habit of just always saying &#x27;later&#x27;.&quot;</p><p>Similarly, if somebody was <em>actually</em> going to work on AGI alignment &quot;later&quot;, I&#x27;d tell them to, every six months, spend a couple of hours coming up with the best current scheme they can devise for aligning AGI and doing useful work on that scheme. Assuming, if they must, that AGI were somehow done with technology resembling current technology. And publishing their best-current-scheme-that-isn&#x27;t-good-enough, at least in the sense of posting it to Facebook; so that they will have a sense of embarrassment about naming a scheme that does not look like somebody actually spent two hours trying to think of the best bad approach.</p><p>There are things we’ll better understand about AI in the future, and things we’ll learn that might give us more confidence that particular research approaches will be relevant to AGI. There may be more future sociological developments akin to Nick Bostrom publishing <em>Superintelligence</em>, Elon Musk tweeting about it and thereby heaving a rock through the Overton Window, or more respectable luminaries like Stuart Russell openly coming on board. The future will hold more AlphaGo-like events to publicly and privately highlight new ground-level advances in ML technique; and it may somehow be that this does <em>not</em> leave us in the same epistemic state as having already seen AlphaGo and GANs and the like. It could happen! I can&#x27;t see exactly how, but the future does have the capacity to pull surprises in that regard.</p><p>But before waiting on that surprise, you should ask whether your uncertainty about AGI timelines is really uncertainty at all.  If it feels to you that guessing AGI might have a 50% probability in N years is not enough knowledge to act upon, if that feels scarily uncertain and you want to wait for more evidence before making any decisions... then ask yourself how you&#x27;d feel if you believed the probability was 50% in N years, and everyone else on Earth also believed it was 50% in N years, and everyone believed it was right and proper to carry out policy P when AGI has a 50% probability of arriving in N years. If that visualization feels very different, then any nervous &quot;uncertainty&quot; you feel about doing P is not really about whether AGI takes much longer than N years to arrive.</p><p>And you are almost surely going to be stuck with that feeling of &quot;uncertainty&quot; no matter how close AGI gets; because no matter how close AGI gets, whatever signs appear will almost surely not produce common, share, agreed-on public knowledge that AGI has a 50% chance of arriving in N years, nor any agreement that it is therefore right and proper to react by doing P.</p><p>And if all that did become common knowledge, then P is unlikely to still be a neglected intervention, or AI alignment a neglected issue; so you will have waited until sadly late to help.</p><p>But far more likely is that the common knowledge just isn&#x27;t going to be there, and so it will always feel nervously &quot;uncertain&quot; to consider acting.</p><p>You can either act despite that, or not act. Not act until it&#x27;s too late to help much, in the best case; not act at all until after it&#x27;s essentially over, in the average case.</p><p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s wise to wait on an unspecified epistemic miracle to change how we feel. In all probability, you&#x27;re going to be in this mental state for a while - including any nervous-feeling &quot;uncertainty&quot;. If you handle this mental state by saying &quot;later&quot;, that general policy is not likely to have good results for Earth.</p><p style=""text-align:center;"">* * *</p><p>Further resources:</p><ul><li><p>MIRI’s research guide (<a href=""https://intelligence.org/research-guide/"">https://intelligence.org/research-guide/</a>) and forum (<a href=""https://agentfoundations.org"">https://agentfoundations.org</a>)</p></li><li><p>FLI’s <a href=""https://futureoflife.org/2016/02/29/introductory-resources-on-ai-safety-research/"">collection of introductory resources</a></p></li><li><p>CHAI’s alignment bibliography at <a href=""http://humancompatible.ai/bibliography"">http://humancompatible.ai/bibliography</a></p></li><li><p>80,000 Hours’ AI job postings on <a href=""https://80000hours.org/job-board/"">https://80000hours.org/job-board/</a></p></li><li><p>The Open Philanthropy Project’s <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/global-catastrophic-risks/potential-risks-advanced-artificial-intelligence/open-philanthropy-project-ai-fellows-program"">AI fellowship</a> and general call for <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/concrete-problems-ai-safety"">research proposals</a></p></li><li><p>My brain-dumps on <a href=""https://arbital.com/explore/2v"">AI alignment</a> </p></li><li><p>If you&#x27;re arriving here for the first time, my long-standing work on <a href=""https://www.lesserwrong.com/sequences"">rationality</a>, and CFAR’s <a href=""http://rationality.org/workshops/upcoming"">workshops</a></p></li><li><p>And some general tips from <a href=""http://effective-altruism.com/ea/17s/what_should_the_average_ea_do_about_ai_alignment/"">Ray Arnold</a> for effective altruists considering AI alignment as a cause area.</p></li></ul></div></div></div></div>",Eliezer_Yudkowsky,eliezer_yudkowsky,Eliezer Yudkowsky,

If something like the Orthodox Sabbath seems impossibly hard, or if you try to keep it but end up breaking it every week – as my Reform Jewish family did – then you should consider that perhaps... <em>you are in a permanent state of emergency</em>.&quot; - Ben Hoffman</p></blockquote><p>Rather than offer solutions in search of problems, I want to shift a context to surface existing problems and remove pressures that disincentive actually trying to solve them.</p><h1>My sketch of a practice</h1><h4>Key Concepts</h4><p>Remove distractions. Emphasize your intentions. Work first with what&#x27;s already within your skillset. Suspend sense-of-failure/awkward/waste and try stuff anyways. Decouple satisfaction with practice from satisfaction with absolute performance. Practice task setups. Keep task contexts whole and meaningful. Shorten feedback loops.</p><p>It&#x27;s the concepts that are important, not the specific path people take to achieve them. That said, I did have an idea for one possible implementation.</p><h4>Simple Implementation</h4><p>Start a 10-hour timer</p><p>Going room by room, cover all the clutter with plain sheets and clear every surface. Only leave out what you will use that day.</p><p>When that&#x27;s done, do whatever feels appropriate... but whatever you do you must try twice.</p><p>When the timer goes off, take down the sheets and put back the items you moved.</p><p>Take 5 minutes to reflect on your day.</p><h1>Expanded thoughts</h1><p><em>(Because a lack of context leads to misunderstandings and lost purposes.)</em></p><p>Start a timer to cover as long as you commit to. This whole day will have you make small commitments and stick to them; this is the first. Better if you can display it prominently, like a 7-hour hourglass.</p><p>All those irrelevancies you could just ignore? Make them invisible instead. Lay plain sheets over cluttered areas in your home or workroom to keep them out of sight and mind. Clear off all visible surfaces, e.g. tables, counters, beds. Clear the home screens on your devices. Maybe draw your curtains and cover your wall art.</p><p>Clear the air of unintentional sounds and smell if you can. Open doors as needed to get fresh air, close windows as needed to block sounds from the street. Put on white noise, apply scent or deodorize, set the thermostat or (de-)humidifier. Silence your device notifications.</p><p>Do the same for your mind, if you think it will help. Write whatever thoughts, ideas, worries come to mind in 2 minutes&#x27; thought onto little cards of paper. Put your stray thoughts under the sheets with everything else.</p><p>Leave <em><u><strong>nothing</strong></u></em> laying out, unless you&#x27;ve made a clear and considered decision to use that day. No plans are invalid—&quot;stare at this object for a while&quot; totally counts as a thing you can prioritize iff you want to—but take care not to collect more intentions than you can act on.  You may leave out mirrors and clocks—or objects that similarly provide continuous, relevant feedback on your actions.</p><p>Deciding how far to take The Clearing will get tricky in some cases. I <em>intended</em> for it to bring those problems to a head. If you&#x27;re on a tight schedule, you want to prioritize the changes you make and what places you need them in. If you switch between environments often, you want to decide how much setup effort to spend at each one. If you spend lots of time in a place you don&#x27;t get to rearrange at will, you want to consider how that changes what you work on there or how long you stay. If you need to keep things looking professional or guest-worthy, you want to think of things like using fancy room dividers instead of sheets. You might converge on keeping a pre-established Practice space easy to setup, and maintaining a set of tools there for making incremental progress on your long term goals.</p><p>With that done, everything you work on today you will try an even number of times. If you do something once, you do it again. If you do something three times, try for a fourth time. It&#x27;s basically up to you what you count as a discrete task, and what you count as trying again.</p><p>Possibilities and examples</p><ul><li><p>You might put everything back as it was and start over.</p><ul><li><p>Go to the store, go back home, go to the store again. Pull out an instrument to practice, put it away, pull it out and practice it some more. Write a page, open a blank page and rewrite it from scratch.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>You might divide your day into blocks of time and spend every other block doing approximately the same activities as the last.</p><ul><li><p>Timer goes off and you remember writing some code, sneaking snacks from the kitchen, and browsing funny cat pictures. You write some code, grab more snacks, and look at funny cat pictures. You set another timer</p></li></ul></li><li><p>You might decide on specific activities to do and incorporate both instances into a whole day plan.</p><ul><li><p>Listen to a podcast in the morning, listen again in the afternoon.

Yes, your extra efforts may not create any useful outcome. Yes, it will probably take more time. I intended this. When do you value self-improvement enough to actually spend resources on exploring and iterating? How much leeway do you usually give yourself to handle genuine errors and unprecedented delays? What skills could you improve if you gave them more focus than you currently do? Where do everyday tasks cause you the most trouble, such that you dread doing any more than strictly necessary, and can you make those parts easier?</p><p>When your day&#x27;s timer goes off, remove the sheets and put moved items back.

<p>Humans have no values... nor do any agent. Unless you make strong assumptions about their rationality.&nbsp;And depending on those assumptions, you get humans to have any values.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>An agent with no clear preferences</h2>
<p>There are three buttons in this world, B(0), B(1), and X, and one agent <strong>H</strong>.</p>
<p>B(0) and B(1) can be operated by <strong>H</strong>, while X can be operated by an outside observer. <strong>H</strong> will initially press button B(0); if ever X is pressed, the agent will switch to pressing B(1). If X is pressed again, the agent will switch back to pressing B(0), and so on. After a large number of turns N, <strong>H</strong> will shut off. That's the full algorithm for <strong>H</strong>.</p>
<p>So the question is, what are the values/preferences/rewards of <strong>H</strong>? There are three natural reward functions that are plausible:</p>
<ul>
<li>R(0), which is linear in the number of times B(0) is pressed.</li>
<li>R(1), which is linear in the number of times B(1) is pressed.</li>
<li>R(2) = I(E,X)R(0) + I(O,X)R(1), where I(E,X) is the indicator function for X being pressed an even number of times,I(O,X)=1-I(E,X) being the indicator function for X being pressed an odd number of times.</li>
</ul>
<p>For R(0), we can interpret <strong>H</strong> as an R(0) maximising agent which X overrides. For R(1), we can interpret <strong>H</strong> as an R(1) maximising agent which X releases from constraints. And R(2) is the ""<strong>H</strong> is always fully rational"" reward. Semantically, these make sense for the various R(i)'s being a true and natural reward, with X=""coercive brain surgery"" in the first case, X=""release <strong>H</strong> from annoying social obligations"" in the second, and X=""switch which of R(0) and R(1) gives you pleasure"".</p>
<p>But note that there is no semantic implications here, all that we know is <strong>H</strong>, with its full algorithm. If we wanted to deduce its true reward for the purpose of something like <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03137"">Inverse Reinforcement Learning</a> (IRL), what would it be?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Modelling human (ir)rationality and reward</h2>
<p>Now let's talk about the preferences of an actual human. We all know that humans are not always rational (how exactly we know this is a very interesting question that I will be digging into). But even if humans were fully rational, the fact remains that we are physical, and vulnerable to things like coercive brain surgery (and in practice, to a whole host of other more or less manipulative techniques). So there will be the equivalent of ""button X"" that overrides human preferences. Thus, ""not immortal and unchangeable"" is in practice enough for the agent to be considered ""not fully rational"".</p>
<p>Now assume that we've thoroughly observed a given human h (including their internal brain wiring), so we know the human policy &pi;(h) (which determines their actions in all circumstances). This is, in practice all that we can ever observe - once we know &pi;(h) perfectly, there is nothing more that observing h can teach us (ignore, just for the moment, the question of the internal wiring of h's brain - that might be able to teach us more, but we'll need extra assumptions).</p>
<p>Let R be a possible human reward function, and <strong>R</strong> the set of such rewards. A human (ir)rationality <em>planning algorithm</em> p (hereafter refereed to as a planner), is a map from <strong>R</strong> to the space of policies (thus p(R) says how a human with reward R will actually behave - for example, this could be bounded rationality, rationality with biases, or many other options). Say that the pair (p,R) is compatible if p(R)=&pi;(h). Thus a human with planner p and reward R would behave as h does.</p>
<p>What possible compatible pairs are there? Here are some candidates:</p>
<ul>
<li>(p(0), R(0)), where p(0) and R(0) are some ""plausible"" or ""acceptable"" planners and reward functions (what this means is a big question).</li>
<li>(p(1), R(1)), where p(1) is the ""fully rational"" planner, and R(1) is a reward that fits to give the required policy.</li>
<li>(p(2), R(2)), where R(2)= -R(1), and p(2)= -p(1), where -p(R) is defined as p(-R); here p(2) is the ""fully anti-rational"" planner.</li>
<li>(p(3), R(3)), where p(3) maps all rewards to &pi;(h), and R(3) is trivial and constant.</li>
<li>(p(4), R(4)), where p(4)= -p(0) and R(4)= -R(0).</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Distinguishing among compatible pairs</h2>
<p>How can we distinguish between compatible pairs? At first appearance, we can't. That's because, by their definition of compatible, all pairs produce the correct policy &pi;(h). And once we have &pi;(h), further observations of h tell us nothing.</p>
<p>I initially thought that Kolmogorov or algorithmic complexity might help us here. But in fact:</p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong>: The pairs (p(i), R(i)), i &ge; 1, are either simpler than (p(0), R(0)), or differ in Kolmogorov complexity from it by a constant that is independent of (p(0), R(0)).</p>
<p><strong>Proof</strong>: The cases of i=4 and i=2 are easy, as these differ from i=0 and i=1 by two minus signs. Given (p(0), R(0)), a fixed-length algorithm computes &pi;(h). Then a fixed length algorithm defines p(3) (by mapping input to &pi;(h)). Furthermore, given &pi;(h) and any history &eta;, a fixed length algorithm computes the action a(&eta;) the agent will take; then a fixed length algorithm defines R(1)(&eta;,a(&eta;))=1 and R(1)(&eta;,b)=0 for b&ne;a(&eta;).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the Kolmogorov complexity can shift between p and R (all in R for i=1,2, all in p for i=3), but it seems that the complexity of the <em>pair</em> doesn't go up during these shifts.</p>
<p>This is puzzling. It seems that, in principle, one cannot assume anything about h's reward at all! R(2)= -R(1), R(4)= -R(0), and p(3) is compatible with any possible reward R. If we give up the assumption of human rationality - which we must - it seems we can't say anything about the human reward function. So it seems IRL must fail.</p>
<p>Yet, in practice, we can and do say a lot about the rationality and reward/desires of various human beings. We talk about ourselves being irrational, as well as others being so. How do we do this? What structure do we need to assume, and is there a way to get AIs to assume the same?</p>
<p>This the question I'll try and partially answer in subsequent posts, using the example of the anchoring bias as a motivating example. The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring"">anchoring bias</a> is one of the clearest of all biases; what is it that allows us to say, with such certainty, that it's a bias (or at least a misfiring heuristic) rather than an odd reward function?</p>",Stuart_Armstrong,stuart_armstrong,Stuart_Armstrong,

Then we conclude the mini-sequence on habits]</em></p><h2><strong>Techniques: Breaking Habits:</strong></h2><p>While creating new habits focuses on reinforcing the link between the Trigger and the Action, breaking habits is about finding ways to disrupt the typical context cue and response mechanism. </p><p>Thus, the techniques below sorta do the opposite of what the stuff in Creating Habits did. For example, by weakening the link between the context cue and the response, we can disable the automaticity. Or, we might substitute it with something more desirable.</p><p>The two techniques we’ll go over are <strong>Going Upstream</strong> and <strong>Substitution</strong>. </p><p><strong>IMAGE: https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*NtngNsQgX035it-vHTY0Jw.png</strong></p><p style=""text-align:center;"">++++</p><h2><strong>Going Upstream:</strong></h2><p><em>[Going Upstream is a set of concepts based around removing the context cues of unwanted habits beforehand so the habit doesn’t activate. It’s backed by experimental evidence, and it fits right in with our standard habit model.]</em></p><h3><strong>Research:</strong></h3><p>The idea behind Going Upstream is that one of the best ways to disrupt a habit is to go straight up to the top.</p><p>By that, I mean you’re targeting the source of the phenomenon, i.e. whatever’s causing it at the very top of the chain *33. Changes upstream should have effects that flow through to the bottom. It’s like how building a dam upstream of a river causes the water flowing down to slow to a trickle. Hence the name.</p><p>But this is probably still a little abstract. Let’s get a bit more specific: </p><p>We know from the standard habit model that habits fire in the presence of certain context cues. And many of these cues are in the environment. </p><p>Thus, one way to remove an unwanted habit through Going Upstream is to limit your exposure to the aforementioned cue. If you don’t encounter the cue, then the habit won’t fire at all.</p><p>For example, say you have an unwanted habit of going into a long bout of distracted browsing after opening your Facebook news feed. One way to make this habit less prevalent by Going Upstream would be to disable your Facebook news feed, removing any chance that you’d get distracted in the first place.</p><p>Going Upstream is functionally very similar to the idea of precommitment, the idea of cutting off some of your options ahead of time to make sure you can stick to your commitments *34. </p><p>An example might be if a dieter throws out all the unhealthy snacks in their house. Then, they replace them all with healthy options. Now, they have no choice but to snack healthily when hungry. </p><p>Or, consider the student who goes to the library to “force” themselves to study because there’s less distractions in the library’s study room than at home. </p><p>We see that principles based in Going Upstream have effects across varied domains, from reducing smoking to improving public transportation usage *35.</p><p style=""text-align:center;"">++++</p><h3><strong>Technique:</strong></h3><p>At its core, Going Upstream is about being able to make choices for your decisions where you have the most control. It’s far easier to remove affect your exposure to the context cue in the first place than to override a habit once the context cue kicks in.</p><p>Using this principle, we’ll go over three sub-techniques which each use the Going Upstream principle: <strong>Trigger Removal</strong>, <strong>Cue Disruption</strong>, and <strong>Changing Friction</strong>.</p><p style=""text-align:center;"">++++</p><h3 style=""text-align:left;""><strong>Going Upstream 1: Trigger Removal</strong></h3><p style=""text-align:left;"">As we already alluded to earlier, one of the most straightforward applications of Going Upstream is to simply remove the Trigger that leads to the habit.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">The steps of Trigger Removal are:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Put your unwanted habit into the TAP framework. <br/></strong>EX: You want to stop consistently checking your phone for notifications. You ask yourself, “What conditions seem to lead to my checking of the phone?” Thinking back to the last few times you checked your phone, you look at the different parts that make you the habit.<br/><br/></p></li><li><p><strong>Identify the Trigger(s) that seem to lead you towards taking the Action.<br/></strong>EX: You realize that it’s like that the “Ping!” sound of notifications seems to be the main Trigger. In situations, your phone will ring, and you notice yourself with the urge to flip your phone to see what happened.<br/><br/></p></li><li><p><strong>Take steps to remove the Trigger from your environment.<br/></strong>EX: You decide to silence your phone’s notifications, so you aren’t prompted to check it on the audio cue. The end result is that your attention becomes less diverted by notifications.</p></li></ol><p>That’s the gist of it—figure out what’s cuing your unwanted habit and remove it from the environment.</p><p style=""text-align:center;"">++++</p><h3 style=""text-align:left;""><strong>Going Upstream 2: Cue Disruption</strong></h3><p style=""text-align:left;"">The more extreme version of Trigger Removal is Cue Disruption, which is based off the idea that certain windows of opportunity make it a lot easier to Go Upstream and alter cues. Specifically, these opportunities happen when there are major shifts in your environment, like when you move to a new town.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">As evidence, we see that when people move to a new, unfamiliar place, this is a prime time to form new habits and break old ones because of the absence of many of their old context cues *36. This seems to be valid for a variety of activities, from taking public transport to watching less TV *37.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">For another example, switching to a new job is also a prime time to try and rid yourself of certain bad workflow habits. Now that you’re in a new environment, you’re sorta given a new slate. The old cues which might have had a major hand in leading to undesirable behaviors are gone, giving you space to try and mindfully create some better TAPs.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Capitalizing on this break in continuity of context cues forms the core of Cue Disruption. Because such changes are uncommon, I’d hesitate to really call this a technique. It’s more of just a general consideration to keep in mind if you find yourself changing environments. </p><p style=""text-align:left;"">And there’s really not too much to it:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Undergo a change in your environment.<br/></strong>EX: Move to a new city.<br/><br/></p></li><li><p><strong>Form new TAPs using the new environmental cues.<br/></strong>EX: Stop eating junk food because you don’t know where the unhealthy restaurants are.</p></li></ol><p>You might not get to use this often, but I mention this because I think it’s good to keep cached in your brain as a viable option when the opportunity does arise.</p><p style=""text-align:center;"">++++</p><h3><strong>Going Upstream 3: Changing Friction</strong></h3><p>As a technique, Trigger Removal clearly doesn’t work for all habits. Not all Triggers are external environmental ones. Other harder-to-target Triggers might involve internal feelings or emotions. Or, the Triggers might be impractical to remove because they’re not something you have direct control over, like what words other people say.</p><p>Especially for situations where you don’t have complete control over the Trigger, the next best thing you can try is just to make it <em>harder</em> for you to access either the Trigger or the Action.</p><p>This is the idea behind Adding Friction. </p><p>“Friction” is being used here to mean additional barriers that prevent immediate access—like how friction in the real world makes smooth sliding more difficult. On the flip side, Reducing Friction is about having less barriers towards action, so that it’s easier to execute good habits.</p><p>An example of Adding Friction would be if you installed a Chrome extension to add a 30 second delay time each time you tried to visit Facebook. This might be preferable to simply blocking Facebook outright because simply removing the Action of “visit Facebook” doesn’t leave you with an alternative. By adding a delay time, you gain an additional opportunity to reconsider and check in with yourself to see if you really need to visit the site.</p><p>Part of Adding Friction, then, is also about finding additional opportunities to inject more time for reflection, so that you can see if the habit is aligned with what you really want.</p><p>An example of Reducing Friction would be if someone wanted to go to the gym every day, and they asked a good friend to bring gym clothes for them and pick them up. This makes it easier by removing barriers which, had they been unaddressed, could have been excuses for not going.</p><p>These might have taken the form thoughts like “Oh man…I can’t find my gym shorts…guess I won’t go exercising today, then…”.</p><p>(Though this section is mainly about breaking habits, Friction, as you can see, is applicable to either creating or breaking habits. It just depends on whether you’re adding or removing it.)</p><p>When applying the concept of Adding and Reducing Friction to habits, the step-by-step process looks a little like:  </p><ol><li><p><strong>Identify the TAP you’d like to affect.<br/></strong>EX: You have a bad internet browsing habit that eats up a lot of time. Looking into yourself, you see that the habit roughly looks like [Feel tired and not engaged] → [Go on a browsing spiral].<br/><br/></p></li><li><p><strong>Look at the Trigger. Find a way to make it easier or harder to encounter. (This is habit-dependent.)<br/></strong>EX: You ask yourself, “How can I change the frequency with which I encounter this Trigger?” You decide to take more frequent breaks while you’re on the computer. This thus reduces the probability of your getting tired and distracted so the TAP doesn’t fire as often.<br/><br/></p></li><li><p><strong>Look at the Action. Find a way to make it easier or harder to take. (Also habit-dependent.)<br/></strong>EX: You could also block the actual sites that you commonly go on or use some web filters to ensure that your work time online is spent only on the places you decide beforehand.</p></li></ol><p>Some of the examples for Adding Friction you can think of probably look a lot like the ones for Trigger Removal, and that’s fine. Overlap between the sub-techniques is okay. The main idea here is just being able to generalize the technique to situations where you might not be able to entirely remove things by thinking in terms of Friction.</p><p>Remember that all of these techniques are suggestions, and all of these techniques are my attempt to make more sense of out of largely general principles. If a different categorization yields results for you, I would recommend you <em>do that instead</em>.</p><p style=""text-align:center;"">++++</p><h2><strong>Substitution:</strong></h2><p><em>[Substitution is where you swap out one Action for another one but keep the same Trigger. In essence, it’s concerned with finding ways to switch out your defaults with better responses.]</em></p><h3><strong>Research:</strong></h3><p>One problem with trying to break unwanted habits is that merely trying to “not do it” is largely ineffective. </p><p>For example, one idea that might appear clever is to create an “anti-TAP” for certain behaviors. While it sounds good to have a habit of not doing something, you’ll end up with TAPs like, “When I think of french fries, I <em>won’t</em> eat them.”</p><p>Which, as it turns, doesn’t work very well *38. Anti-TAPs are ineffective because when you tell yourself to <em>not</em> do X, the focus is <em>still</em> on X. This seems to be potentially due to ironic process theory, the idea that trying to suppress certain thoughts only brings them to mind.</p><p>It’s the same reason why telling someone to not imagine a red horse driving a blue convertible only makes the absurd image more vivid in their heads. Having a TAP that tells you what not to do isn’t useful when it doesn’t <em>concretely provide an alternative</em>.</p><p>Otherwise, all that’s bouncing around in your head is the very thing you told yourself not to do.</p><p>Thus, the more reasonable thing to do is to find ways to re-engineer your existing TAPs such that you can instead take an improved alternative action. This gives you another actionable to instead of just leaving you with no way out.</p><p>As a technique, Substitution is about trying actually specify what to do instead of just attempting to suppress the original response after encountering the context cue *39. </p><p>This is more reasonable because your focus can be directed on the alternative action instead of just dwelling on how much you don’t want to do something. </p><h3><strong>Technique:</strong></h3><p>Substitution in a systematic layout looks like:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Identify the TAP you’d like to change, specifically the Trigger.<br/></strong>EX: You’d like to drink less soda. You notice that you typically think of getting sodas after ordering a burger.<br/><br/></p></li><li><p><strong>Find an alternative Action to replace it with that’s more satisfactory.<br/></strong>EX: You decide to ask for an ice water instead.<br/><br/></p></li><li><p><strong>Do 5 mental run-throughs of the updated TAP and keep track of your progress with tools from Systematic Planning.<br/></strong>EX: You do 5 mental run-throughs of ordering water instead of soda.</p></li></ol><p>That’s it. Of course the rest of the guidelines from making TAPs still hold, like choosing concrete actions and writing it down. But the overall concept, like many of the techniques we’ve gone over, is quite simple.</p><p>Especially for habits with Triggers you don’t have complete control over, Substitution can be a useful intervention to improve your routines †6. </p><p>I think that Substitution sorta actually represents the core concept behind behavior change. When you want to do something different (and hopefully better), there’s necessarily some sort of swapping happening.</p><p>There’s roughly a 3-step process here that looks a little like this:</p><p>(Note the actual Substitution algorithm differs a little from the one below, but I claim the central ideas are very similar.)</p><ol><li><p><strong>Notice a behavior.<br/></strong>EX: “Huh, I just felt jealous when Mary got more attention than me.”<br/><br/></p></li><li><p><strong>Reflect on the action.<br/></strong>EX: “Hm, that doesn’t seem to be very good. Mary’s had it hard the last few months. What can I do instead?”<br/><br/></p></li><li><p><strong>Swap out the default for something new.<br/></strong>EX: “Okay, so instead, when someone compliments Mary, I can instead try to imagine how it feels to be her. I think that’ll dissipate some of my envy.”</p></li></ol><p>And as we go on to delve into more ideas, this’ll be good to keep in mind. Much of improvement follows this sort of “overriding defaults” idea. You’re trying to answer the question of <strong>“How can I make things incrementally better?”</strong></p><p style=""text-align:center;"">++++</p><h2><strong>tldr;</strong></h2><p>We’ve gone a whirlwind tour of the way that habits operate, from models to techniques. Here’s a short recap of all of the things we’ve covered.</p><ol><li><p>Habits can be basically thought of a combination of a <strong>Trigger</strong> and a responding <strong>Action</strong>.<br/></p></li><li><p>Habits are <strong>automatic</strong> and <strong>keep sticking around</strong>, even if you don’t want them to. And rewards don’t to much to change them.<br/></p></li><li><p>Habits take somewhere in the neighborhood of <strong>2 months</strong> to form.<br/></p></li><li><p>Creating habits consists of explicitly <strong>building</strong> the Trigger and the Action you want. The rest of the techniques are ways to reinforce this connection.<br/></p></li><li><p>Breaking habits is about <strong>disrupting</strong> the chain between the Trigger and the Action. The rest of the techniques are ways to swap things up or modify the chain.</p></li></ol><p style=""text-align:center;"">++++</p><h2><strong>Conclusion:</strong></h2><p><strong>IMAGE: https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Xh0KRH_syx1lAvcoGAr00w.png</strong></p><p>There&#x27;s much more to habits than I’ve covered here. In the interest of accessibility, I’ve made lots of simplifications, and I’ve skipped over entire sub-fields like conditioning and learning theory.</p><p>If you want to read just one “real” paper on the topic for a more academic overview, I’d strongly recommend <em>Psychology of Habit</em> by Wendy Wood and Dennis Rünger. It’s a fantastic overview of the many facets of habits, and I copied a lot of the same categories they used in this Habits 101 doc.</p><p>But we covered a lot of stuff in this primer.</p><p>And building habits is hard.</p><p>And there’s still the question of “motivation”. </p><p>(Whatever that is.)</p><p>I know getting started might be effortful. Still, I hope that I’ve given you enough tools to at least have a structured way of thinking about habits. </p><p>When you decide that you <strong>want to</strong> start tinkering with your own routines, you’ll now have some effective tools to start experimenting with.</p><p style=""text-align:center;"">++++</p><h2><strong>Footnotes (†):</strong></h2><p>†1. While this definition is what’s used by many papers on habits, note that disputes still exist between what the “best” definition is. See *3 for an in-depth discussion. In my opinion, most of the dispute is fairly pedantic, and for practical purposes, the one given is good enough.</p><p>†2. Addiction and habituation aren’t exactly the same thing, but my understanding is that they’re quite similar, so I equated the two for ease of understanding. For a deeper look, you can check out *40.</p><p>†3. While I think that the general point here stands, note that ego depletion, one of the core ideas behind the idea of willpower-as-a-resource is currently on shaky ground. See *41 for more information.</p><p>†4. Although there are some technical differences between how habits and implementation intentions operate, I’ll be using the two terms interchangeably, as our focus is on <em>intentionally</em> creating habits, which resolves much of the differences in definition.</p><p>†5. As we’re smashing two related concepts together without a concrete evidence base for the actual technique, it’s valid to point out that Scaling Up is less well-established than other things we’ve gone over.</p><p>†6. I do think that there’s bound to be some sort of cognitive dissonance when the old Action and the new Action both try to fire (although I didn’t find any papers on this specifically), which I agree is less than ideal. </p><p>However, we do have anecdotal evidence that people can overcome their bad habits, so I&#x27;m less concerned about this being a major problem. But it does seem good to acknowledge it.</p><p style=""text-align:center;"">++++</p><h2><strong>References (*):</strong></h2><p>1. Wood, Wendy, Jeffrey M. Quinn, and Deborah A.

Alan Kay tries to give the viewer a sense of the vast scale of how much code we’re writing, and then asks the open question of whether that’s how much code we really need to write to get that much functionality. There’s good evidence it isn’t, including both research Kay has done at the Viewpoints Research Institute, along with a biological metaphor showing how the machines we build don’t have the necessary capability to let us easily modify them without understanding the details of their every inner component.</p><p><strong>Epistemology</strong> - This is the talk where Kay gives his famous ‘perspective is worth 80 IQ points’ quip. Kay discusses how the sheer genius of someone like Leonardo merely allowed him to dream about vehicles he couldn’t build without a working engine. He then goes into a short analysis of how many new useful resources exist in software when it comes to outlook, versus the scant progress that has been made in utilizing them. He compares the situation with computer science to that of music, where only a tiny fraction of a fraction of all possible musical theory is actually used to produce popular music.</p><p><strong>Complexity versus Complication</strong> - Kay theorizes that there is a complexity curve and a complication curve, and that the curve for complication (i.e, inefficient modeling) grows much faster than the curve for complexity. To the point where the right abstraction is the difference between humans being able and unable to manage a system.</p><p><strong>Tinkering versus Mathematics versus Science versus Engineering</strong> - Kay provides a taxonomy of human artifact production, which distinguishes between several categories of endeavor that are not usually well defined. For example, he points out that mathematics had to be invented, and before it people used giant books of known tested values and binary search to build large structures.</p><p><strong>T-Shirt Science</strong> - Kay provides a notion that science is about taking a complex idea and boiling it down to its most basic components, so that the ideas which can produce a bridge fit on a t-shirt. He provides the first Lisp interpreter as an example in this class, and hypothesizes that more work in this vein is necessary for Computer Science to progress as a field.</p><p style=""text-align:left;""><strong>Demonstrations</strong> - Finally Kay demonstrates a few software products developed by his team that try to utilize the principles outlined in the rest of the talk.</p><p></p></div></div></div></div>",ingres,ingres,namespace,

<p class=""p1"">If they are the first person to exist, it probably says that morning was for some reason a convenient time to sleep.</p>
<p class=""p1"">If they live in modern society, it might say that they are lazy and weak willed.</p>
<p class=""p1"">How did getting up at one time or another come to signal laziness? You still have to get up once per day.</p>
<p class=""p1"">One story I can imagine is that originally there was some weaker reason to get up early. For instance if your work benefited by sunlight, you could get a bit more in. And then since that was a reasonable thing to do, people who didn’t do it looked like they were less good at getting up. Which made getting up early even better thing to do, so that everyone knows that you can.</p>
<p class=""p1"">And then people who had been on the fence before about whether to bother getting up early started to find it worth their while.<span class=""Apple-converted-space"">  </span>Making the remaining noon-sleepers even more weak willed on average. And so it continues, until sleeping until the afternoon strongly suggests laziness.</p>
<p class=""p1"">In general, if an action is a tiny bit good, not doing it can look a tiny bit bad (or stupid, or lazy, or incapable). Which makes it better to do, which makes it look worse to not do it, and so on. And maybe in the end the speck of good that started this disappears, but the value of sending the signal if you can is enough that the equilibrium is stable.</p>

Basically it’s a way of chaining together actions and situations.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">In writing, it roughly looks like:</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">“I intend to do action X when I encounter situation Y!”</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">As an example, a typical implementation intention for eating healthier might look like: “I intend to fill up half my plate with veggies whenever I am at a self-serve restaurant.”</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Compared to many other behavioral change interventions, implementation have a stronger evidence base, and they’re simple to put into practice.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">In a meta-analysis of over 90 studies involving implementation intentions, we found that they “had a positive effect of medium‐to‐large magnitude ([effect size] = 0.65) on goal attainment” *23.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Thus, as one would expect, research that shows people who make implementation intentions have a far higher success rate of achieving their target behavior compared to people who merely hold normal intentions (EX: “I intend to do X”) *24.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">CFAR’s Trigger Action Plan model builds on the implementation intention model and tailors it to the standard habit model, focusing on selecting concrete context cues and specific actions †4.</p><p style=""text-align:center;"">++++</p><h3 style=""text-align:left;""><strong>Technique:</strong></h3><p style=""text-align:left;"">TAPs combine what we know about the standard habit model of a context cue paired with a response with the if-then nature of implementation intentions.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Trigger Action Planning has us specify specifically when and how we’d like to behave via a Trigger and an Action. It deliberately utilizes the same process that our habits naturally arise, allowing us to intentionally create new habits.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">A TAP takes the form of:</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">When [Trigger X] happens, I will perform [Action Y]. Schematically, it’s almost identical to the implementation intention setup. But the TAP model stresses a few different factors.</p></div></div></div></div><div class=""ory-row ory-cell-inner""><div class=""ory-cell ory-cell-sm-12 ory-cell-xs-12""><div class=""ory-cell-inner ory-cell-leaf""><div><img class=""ory-plugins-content-image"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*i3PVZkz4ZX1aXFByD6GqMg.png""/></div></div></div></div><div class=""ory-row ory-cell-inner""><div class=""ory-cell ory-cell-sm-12 ory-cell-xs-12""><div class=""ory-cell-inner ory-cell-leaf""><div><p style=""text-align:left;"">Here’s a step-by-step walkthrough of how to make your own TAP:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Identify an Action you want to do.<br/></strong>EX: “Go jogging more.”<br/><br/></p></li><li><p><strong>Find a concrete sensory Trigger for the situation where you want the action to happen.<br/></strong>EX: “The feeling of the coarse rope that opens my curtains in the morning.”<br/><br/></p></li><li><p><strong>Describe the Action you’d like to perform, in detail. Be specific about the action you’d like to.<br/></strong>EX: “Pick up my jogging shoes and walk outside the door to begin jogging.”<br/><br/></p></li><li><p><strong>Put the Trigger and Action in a “When [Trigger], then [Action]” loop.<br/></strong>EX: “When [I feel the rough coarseness of my curtain rope,] then [I’ll go grab my jogging shoes and open the front door].”<br/><br/></p></li><li><p><strong>Write the TAP down somewhere you can find it again.<br/></strong>EX: Having a digital or physical “TAPs List” document can be a very strong way to make it easy to review which habits you’re currently training. If you end up forgetting the cue or action, then it’s obvious you won’t be able to practice the behavior.<br/><br/></p></li><li><p><strong>Mentally rehearse the TAP at least 5 times.<br/></strong>EX: Actually take the several minutes to do some visualizations—going over it in your mind helps you recognize the Triggers when they show up in the real world.</p></li></ol><p style=""text-align:left;"">Specificity and concreteness are very useful here because a more salient cue is easier to recognize. Thus, for any TAP, the best Triggers are the ones that are a clear sensory sensation you can recognize. You don’t have to be limited by external cues, though; this can also be applied to internal sensations if you’re noticing them.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">As an example, if you’re trying to avoid snapping at someone when they irritate you, you can try to break down the feelings right after they speak. Maybe it feels like a tightening in your chest, or a sinking feeling in your stomach.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">The important thing here is to describe the internal feeling with enough detail such that you can recognize it the next time it happens.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Questions to perhaps ask yourself are “Where in my body do I feel the sensation?” and “What does the sensation feel like it’s doing inside?”</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Good places to insert TAPs are at the end of existing routines, a procedure called piggybacking. We see that people who put their implementation intentions at the end of habits they already have, like deciding to floss right after brushing, are more successful *25.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Thus, TAPs can themselves be the Trigger for future TAPs.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">The most important thing is that both the Trigger and Action are specific enough such that you just do it without thinking. Vaguely-specified Actions are not as good as well-quantified ones because you need to spend time trying to remember what it means.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">For example, say we have this TAP:</p><p style=""text-align:left;""><strong>Trigger: </strong>“When I finish a reading an online article…”</p><p style=""text-align:left;""><strong>→</strong></p><p style=""text-align:left;""><strong>Action:</strong> “then I will summarize it.”</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Both the Trigger and Action could be made more specific. Going into more detail, a perhaps improved version of the above might look like:</p><p style=""text-align:left;""><strong>Trigger:</strong> “When I click the red ‘X’ to close a window after reading an online article…”</p><p style=""text-align:left;""><strong>→</strong></p><p style=""text-align:left;""><strong>Action:</strong> “then I will set a 5 minute timer. For the next 5 minutes, I’ll type out a summary of what I just read on Microsoft Word.”</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">I think the second formulation is better because it’s more specific about what the Trigger is, and it also unpacks the word “summarize” by turning it into a more concrete set of actions.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Oftentimes, like above, it can be good enough to let the Action part of your TAP be the start of a longer action chain.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Above, the 5 minute timer is merely a way to get started. After the 5 minutes are up, you can continue writing your summary, especially if you find yourself in the middle of something interesting.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Likewise, in the earlier exercising example, the Action simply has you go through the front door. But once that happens, the TAP doesn’t need to worry about describing the actual jogging; once you’re outside, the rest of your body can take over.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">For both of these examples, TAPs are used as a way to simply get started in the first place.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">In terms of habits, TAPs help you get started on things you already wanted to do, but might otherwise have forgotten. They’re a type of reminder of sorts. You’ll typically want to use them on things that you would feel driven to do <em>if</em> you had the opportunity to act on them in the first place.</p><p style=""text-align:center;"">++++</p><h2 style=""text-align:left;""><strong>TAPs Examples:</strong></h2><p style=""text-align:left;"">To get more of a feel for TAPs, here are four additional examples of Trigger Action Plans that I use. I’ll admit that they don’t conform exactly to the ideal TAP model, but such is the process of translating from theory to practice. Still, I think they help give a better idea of what TAPs might look like in practice for you.</p><h3 style=""text-align:left;""><strong>To-Do List TAP:</strong></h3><p style=""text-align:left;"">My memory isn’t perfect, and I often need to remember things that randomly pop into my head that take the form of to-dos. For example, “talk to Daniel”, “send this email”, or “purchase more pens”.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">To help with this, I have the Todoist app downloaded on my phone, and I use this TAP:</p><p style=""text-align:left;""><strong>Trigger: </strong>“When I think of something I need to do…” </p><p style=""text-align:left;""><strong>→ </strong></p><p style=""text-align:left;""><strong>Action: </strong>“then I will open up Todoist on my phone and put it in.”</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">After doing this TAP a few times, it’s become far more automatic; once I think of something, my next logical thought is, “Okay, now let me put it into Todoist.” While this doesn’t go all the way (after all, I still need to actually do the item), just having this TAP has made it far less likely that to-dos slip through the cracks in my mind.</p><p style=""text-align:center;"">++++</p><h3 style=""text-align:left;""><strong>Conversation TAP:</strong></h3><p style=""text-align:left;"">In conversations, I’m not always on top of things. It can be easy for me to zone out, as I think of something, and then all I hear are meaningless word-shaped sounds. In the past, I’d often want to ask the other party to repeat what they just said, but by the time I finished deliberating whether or not to ask, more words would have been said, and I’d be even further behind in the conversation.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Now I have a TAP for these sorts of situations:</p><p style=""text-align:left;""><strong>Trigger: </strong>“When I hear sounds that should probably be be words but which feel like they have no meaning…”</p><p style=""text-align:left;""><strong>→ </strong></p><p style=""text-align:left;""><strong>Action:</strong> “then I will immediately respond, ‘Sorry, my bad! I didn’t quite understand. Could you say that again using different words?’”</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">In my experience, people are largely forgiving if you’re genuinely trying to stay focused on the conversation, and I’m all for little hacks that make communication better. </p><p style=""text-align:left;"">A related issue for me is when someone says something that I understand on a S2 level, i.e. I know what all the words in the sentence mean, but I still don’t have a good idea of what they mean by such a sentence. In these types of situations, I have a similar TAP:</p><p style=""text-align:left;""><strong>Trigger:</strong> “When someone says something that doesn’t give me a clear mental picture…” </p><p style=""text-align:left;"">→ </p><p style=""text-align:left;""><strong>Action:</strong> “Then I will immediately say, ‘Sorry, I’m not sure I follow. What’s an example of that?’”</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Hopefully the Trigger here makes sense. I often think in terms of quick mental pictures. As the other person is speaking, I’ve got some visuals that correspond to the words they’re saying. It’s not exactly like I’m imagining a mental movie as they’re speaking, but it’s a little similar. </p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Therefore, if someone says something that doesn’t lead to a mental image, this is a good sign for me that I probably don’t understand as much as I thought I did. Hence the Action in response to ask for more examples, which can hopefully make their point more concrete.</p><p style=""text-align:center;"">++++</p><h3 style=""text-align:left;""><strong>Journaling TAP:</strong></h3><p style=""text-align:left;"">This TAP is a good way to remind myself to journal, and I’ve successfully been using a variant of it for several years; I’ve been journaling daily since about 2014. It’s an example of piggybacking in that it uses the ending of an existing routine as the trigger.</p><p style=""text-align:left;""><strong>Trigger:</strong> “When I finish brushing my teeth…”</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">→</p><p style=""text-align:left;""><strong>Action:</strong> “I will go and write down today’s events in my journal.”  </p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Brushing my teeth is already an invariant in my schedule, so that makes it a good Trigger to build new routines off of. Like I mentioned earlier about TAPs being used to initiate action, the Journaling TAP is used to get myself in a position to start writing.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Once I’m automatically in position, my more conscious thinking can take over, dictating what I actually write. The TAP is used to make sure I get there in the first place without much effort.</p><p style=""text-align:center;"">++++</p><h2 style=""text-align:left;""><strong>Actually Practicing: Make Your Own TAP</strong></h2><p style=""text-align:left;"">Going over a technique like TAPs in your head can be useful, but the trick is to really use it in the real world. Thus, it’s very, very strongly recommended that you take the next 10 minutes to try out the following exercise:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Grab a piece of paper and a pen.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Set a 10 minute timer.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Create a TAP, following the steps already outlined above.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Make sure you actually walk it through at least 5 times in your head!</strong></p></li></ol><p style=""text-align:left;"">Sure, you could always try out a TAP later, but this is a natural stopping point before we move on. Meaning that this is an <em>especially good opportunity</em> for you to stop reading, take 10 minutes, and actually start making your own TAPs.</p><p style=""text-align:center;"">++++</p><h2 style=""text-align:left;""><strong>Systematic Planning:</strong></h2><p style=""text-align:left;""><em>[Systematic Planning is a synthesis of interventions based around planning and monitoring. It focuses on additional ways to increase habit strength and frequency by building off the TAP model.] </em></p><h3 style=""text-align:left;""><strong>Research:</strong></h3><p style=""text-align:left;"">Systematic Planning draws from both two interventions: <strong>action planning</strong> and <strong>active monitoring</strong>.</p><p style=""text-align:left;""><strong>Action planning</strong>, as the name very clearly informs us, is a form of planning *26. It involves trying to answer questions like “What barriers would prevent me from carrying out my intended behavior? How can I remove those barriers?”</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">In essence, it’s  a very top-down approach to figuring out behavior change. When you’re action planning, you’re literally just planning for the action. You’re trying to make the task as frictionless as possible for Future You by identifying potential problems and making contingency plans.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Given that we’ve already covered how to plan better, we can apply those lessons here.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">All our previous tools like <strong>Murphyjitsu</strong> and <strong>Reference Class Forecasting</strong> once again come into play.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">(Five second summary: Murphyjitsu asks us to imagine the most common failure modes for our plans by first assuming that they’ll fail. Reference Class Forecasting says we should rely on past information to make more accurate predictions.)</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">An example of action planning might look like this: </p><p style=""text-align:left;"">You’d like to stop watching television. So you ask yourself whether or not you’d be surprised if you went all of tomorrow without watching television. Your gut says no because Game of Thrones is on. So you decide to hide your remote and check your surprise level again. </p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Maybe this time you’d be more surprised if you found a way to still watch television. Maybe not.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Either way, the point here is that action planning allows you to perform these constant feasibility checks to see if you’d really be able to perform the target behavior.</p><p style=""text-align:left;""><strong>Active monitoring</strong> refers to the act of checking in to track your progress on a habit and seeing how far along you are. </p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Both action planning and active monitoring take a sort of <strong>outside view</strong>, where you’re evaluating things without taking part in them. In contrast, TAPs are about being able to respond in the moment; they provide more of an <strong>inside view</strong>. Compared to action planning and active monitoring, TAPs are more <em>reactive</em> than <em>evaluative</em>.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">For example, someone doing active monitoring on their vegetable-eating habit might spend some time every day tracking their meals. They might look at how many meals had vegetables, keeping track of their progress over time.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Both action planning and active monitoring have been shown to increase uptake of desired behavior. Action planning has been shown to be effective in several studies, including longer-term effects *26. And a meta-analysis of monitoring in 138 studies showed that it had a small-medium effect size (0.4) on actual goal attainment *42. </p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Basically, we have the unsurprising result that making plans and writing things down helps make it more likely that people actually get things done.</p><p style=""text-align:center;"">++++</p><h3 style=""text-align:left;""><strong>Technique:</strong></h3><p style=""text-align:left;"">As a technique, TAPs play the role of answering the question “How can I form intentional habits?” </p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Conversely, Systematic Planning as a technique is about answering the question “How do I make sure I actually use my TAPs?”</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">As a result, Systematic Planning is less about providing an alternative model for forming habits. Rather, it’s about providing additional useful considerations when using the TAP model. This also means that it’s a combination of ideas rather than just one thing.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">First, though, there’s something interesting to note about how planning and habits, Murphyjitsu and TAPs in particular, are related: </p><p style=""text-align:left;""><strong>You can run Murphyjitsu when making a new TAP, but you can also make a TAP out of Murphyjitsu.</strong></p><p style=""text-align:left;"">An example of using Murphyjitsu when making a new TAP might look like this: </p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Say you would like to check email more on your phone. You make a TAP that looks like [Open phone] → [Check email]. Unsure if your TAP will be successful, you imagine that it’s a week later and you didn’t start developing your habit. </p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Using Murphyjitsu, you ask yourself, “What is the most plausible reason that this TAP didn’t stick?” In response, your internal simulation of events tells you that it’s likely the Trigger wasn’t salient enough. So you update your TAP with a more specific Trigger.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">An example of making a TAP out of Murphyjitsu might look like this: </p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Say that as you tell your friend what time you’ll meet them at the park, you pause—something about the situation feels odd. Internally, a TAP fires off: [Give a time estimate] → [Imagine one thing that might cause a delay]. </p><p style=""text-align:left;"">As a result, you end up adding an extra ten minutes to your estimate to account for potential traffic. While what you’re doing isn’t exactly the whole Murphyjitsu process, you’re able to get most of the value by turning it into a quick TAP that habituates.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">So there’s something interesting going on here where you can feed one technique into the other and vice-versa. They complement each other in part because each process involves the other—planning well is a habit, but you can also figure out how to make your habits better if you do some planning.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">I bring this up to introduce the idea of <strong><em>meta-TAPs</em></strong>, that is to say, TAPs which are designed to help out your other TAPs. </p><p style=""text-align:left;"">As a collection of considerations, I think that Systematic Planning is clearer to understand when the concepts are shown as practical meta-TAPs you can start doing right away.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Thus, I’ll be framing Systematic Planning as a series of three techniques: Active Monitoring, TAP Everything, and Murphyjitsu Your TAPs.</p><p style=""text-align:center;"">++++</p><h3 style=""text-align:left;""><strong>Systematic Planning 1: Active Monitoring</strong></h3><p style=""text-align:left;"">As we covered, actively monitoring the progress on your habits is a strong way to improve your habits. </p><p style=""text-align:left;"">You’re checking to see whether or not you’ve been executing your TAPs and mentally rehearsing the Triggers. You’re taking the time to sit down and track where you are in regards to learning all of your TAPs.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Like most other routine activities, Active Monitoring is probably best done piggybacking off an existing part of your schedule. I’d recommend the mornings as an especially good time, as you can review your TAPs once more before you go off on your day, where you’ll start to see all your potential Triggers.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">While everyone’s actual monitoring questions might be different, here is a sample set of questions you can feel free to use:</p><ol><li><p><strong>What is the TAP you are trying to learn?</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Did you do it sometime in the last week? Write down at least 1 example situation.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>What are 3 examples where the Trigger might come up?</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Visualize yourself doing the Action 3 times.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Repeat these questions for each TAP on your TAPs list</strong></p></li></ol><p style=""text-align:left;"">(If you for some reason want to print out a hard copy, <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OW0VOwBvBSAGg8F-af8xPe4nZVztc2997ZOX17rZ2-4/edit"">here is a Google Drive link</a>.)</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">This is what Active Monitoring might look like as a TAP:</p><p style=""text-align:left;""><strong>Trigger:</strong> “After I finish eating breakfast…” </p><p style=""text-align:left;""><strong>→ </strong></p><p style=""text-align:left;""><strong>Action:</strong> “Then I will immediately go and fill out my Active Monitoring TAP Worksheet.”</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Don’t worry if you’re not going through every question or you’re using a different format. While people often tell you not to half-ass things, I think that I’d recommend consistently doing a poor job rather than sometimes doing in-depth Active Monitoring.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">In the studies involving active monitoring, the actual method of monitoring was less important than the actual monitoring itself.</p><p style=""text-align:center;"">++++</p><h3 style=""text-align:left;""><strong>Systematic Planning 2: TAP Everything</strong></h3><p style=""text-align:left;"">By now, I hope it’s clear that the TAP framework is a simple and flexible way to frame behavioral change. Yet, thinking of new behaviors in this model isn’t always our default mode of thinking. We’re often thinking about just what we want to do, rather than the when, where and how.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Having a structured way to make new habits like the TAP model is good, but you also need to get into a habit of actually using it. Thus, one way to make this process more habitual is to have a TAP designed to look for new opportunities to make TAPs.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">(“So I heard you like TAPs…”) </p><p style=""text-align:left;"">For example, say you’re talking to someone who opens up with a very nice conversation starter: </p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Initially, you might think, “Oh, that was a pretty cool way to start things, I should try that next time.” </p><p style=""text-align:left;"">If you’re trying to hunt for practicality, though, you might want to think, “Huh, that phrase was a neat way to start things. Let’s make a TAP out of this. Maybe something like [Next time I meet a nice stranger] → [Say these words]…”</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">This way, you’re turning your desires into actual actionables and habits.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">The important thing here isn’t to conform exactly to the specifics TAP model, but to get in the habit of viewing things in the “if-then” style, which makes it easier for you to actually execute on the actions you prefer.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">A “TAP Everything” meta-TAP might look like this:</p><p style=""text-align:left;""><strong>Trigger: </strong>“When I notice myself thinking, ‘I want to do X’…”  </p><p style=""text-align:left;""><strong>→</strong></p><p style=""text-align:left;""><strong>Action: </strong>“Look for a specific Trigger to do X and turn it into a TAP.”</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Basically, I’m suggesting you should make a habit out of making habits.</p><p style=""text-align:center;"">++++</p><h3 style=""text-align:left;""><strong>Systematic Planning 3: Murphyjitsu Your TAPs</strong></h3><p style=""text-align:left;"">We touched upon this earlier in the example about how different techniques can feed into one another, and this section just states it a little more clearly. </p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Murphyjitsu and the related set of planning prompts is very useful, and having them fire off when making a TAP can make them more robust and likely to succeed.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Thus, we can also make a TAP for this!</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">TAPs work best when the Trigger is clear and the Action is explicit, so most of the common failure modes are because either one or both of the two components are unclear.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">So an example “Murphyjitsu Your TAPs” meta-TAP might look like this:</p><p style=""text-align:left;""><strong>Trigger:</strong> “When I think of both the Trigger and the Action for a TAP…”</p><p style=""text-align:left;""><strong>→ </strong></p><p style=""text-align:left;""><strong>Action:</strong> “I will imagine that it’s one week later and I haven’t done my TAP at all. What are the first two failures that come to mind? How can I patch my TAP to fix them?”</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">It’s less important that we plan for all failures and more important that we just do this in the first place, like in Active Monitoring. We can get most of the value by just checking for a few of the most common failure modes.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">This is where things get interconnected and fun:</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Once you’ve developed the “TAP Everything”-TAP, you now have a new routine action which would serve as a very good Trigger for your “Murphyjitsu Your TAPs”-TAP.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">The end goal here would be for  “TAP Everything”-TAP and “Murphyjitsu Your TAPs”-TAP to end up becoming chunked together, into one unit. Research in chunking shows that actions habitually done together can end up forming a cached sequence, where one action follows another *27. </p><p style=""text-align:left;"">So there’s some hope that we’ll eventually be able to “chain” habits together, in larger structures similar to how habits themselves consist of a context cue and a response. </p><p style=""text-align:left;"">(Although this is more geared towards motor skills, it at least seems plausible that mental actions could work in a similar way.)</p><p style=""text-align:center;"">++++</p><h2 style=""text-align:left;""><strong>Scaling Up:</strong></h2><p style=""text-align:left;""><em>[Scaling Up is one simple way to fight the “intention-action gap”, the phenomenon where our desires and actions don’t align. It involves gradually building up an action so that at every step, it’s not too difficult.]</em></p><h3 style=""text-align:left;""><strong>Research:</strong></h3><p style=""text-align:left;"">Scaling Up is a technique intended to bridge the <strong>intention-action gap</strong>.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">The intention-action gap is a term used in the research to point at situations where we might fail to take action, despite holding the intention to do so *28. </p><p style=""text-align:left;"">A typical example might be that of someone who wants to exercise more, knows it’s good for them, yet still doesn’t find themselves doing it. Or, the dieter who’d like to eat more healthily, is aware of the benefits, but still isn’t doing so.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Why is this important when considering habits?</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Well, when forming TAPs, we saw earlier that they work best on actions you already <em>wanted </em>to do. But what about actions you know are good for you, but don’t really want to get done? This is where finding concrete strategies to bridge the gap are important.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">First off, it seems good to differentiate between roughly two relevant reasons here that a habit might not stick:</p><ol><li><p>You <strong>forget</strong> about the action when the opportunity comes.</p></li><li><p>You <strong>don’t want to</strong> do the action when the opportunity comes.</p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class=""ory-row ory-cell-inner""><div class=""ory-cell ory-cell-sm-12 ory-cell-xs-12""><div class=""ory-cell-inner ory-cell-leaf""><div><img class=""ory-plugins-content-image"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*C5z0Me2BPTgwzc6KzjKF6A.png""/></div></div></div></div><div class=""ory-row ory-cell-inner""><div class=""ory-cell ory-cell-sm-12 ory-cell-xs-12""><div class=""ory-cell-inner ory-cell-leaf""><div><p style=""text-align:left;""></p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Most of the research on crossing the intention-action gap seems to focus on planning or implementation intentions as a way to increase the chances of actually acting on desired behavior *29. This is for the first problem, and it’s where TAPs and Systematic Planning work best.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">To try and address all of the second problem—the question of “wanting”—would likely require its own primer. There’s a lot of intricacies to breaking apart exactly what it means to “want” or to “want want” something. Thus, the actual technique for Scaling Up merely scratches the surface of what could be a much deeper discussion.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">As the name suggests, Scaling Up suggests taking an action and gradually building on it. </p><p style=""text-align:center;"">++++</p><h3 style=""text-align:left;""><strong>Technique:</strong></h3><p style=""text-align:left;"">In short, Scaling Up says if the action you’d like to turn into a habit is undesirable to you, start small and build up. You initiate with a watered down, doable version of the activity, and gradually scale up.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">The evidence base for this technique comes from a combination of shaping and exposure therapy †5. </p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Shaping is, roughly speaking, the idea of gradually rewarding behavior that gets closer and closer to the target *31. With incremental changes each time, this allows for the building up of even quite complex behaviors. When applied to habit learning, this means eventually doing the hard action you felt aversive to in the beginning.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">A good example may be something like walking across a balance beam, where you don’t try to go all the way across on your first time.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Perhaps you first start out by just standing still and balancing. Then you try to take 3 steps with good form before falling. Then maybe 6 steps. And after that maybe halfway across the entire beam.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">The point is that every step of the way, you’re working to an intermediate goal which brings you closer to the final step. You’re never biting off more than you can chew.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">One of the main lessons here is that expanding your expected timeframe for goal achievement can make scaling up to the hard thing more bearable. </p><p style=""text-align:left;"">While this seems to be obvious for things like exercise, I don’t think people always translate this idea into other contexts like studying, which ends up with people doing things like trying to write an essay the night before.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">The other part of the technique draws inspiration from exposure therapy, the process by which consistently being exposed to aversive phenomenon can decrease the degree of aversion *32.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Though this is speculative, it at least seems plausible that consistently successfully doing even an easier version of the hard or aversive action is useful. Doing so could provide additional experiential evidence that said action is not so bad after all, allowing your brain to update the negative feelings associated with the target behavior.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">If we go back to the balance beam example, walking only a few steps is likely lower resistance. Then, the next time you go to the balance beam, your locally cached feelings of “Hey, that wasn’t so bad last time!” can help make it a little more palatable as well.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Taken together, these two parts form the evidence base for scaling up in level as a potentially viable solution for dealing with trying to habituate aversive behaviors. (Remember that there’s far more depth here, and the following technique merely scratches the surface.)</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">As an actual technique, Scaling Up is about finding first a manageable chunk of the actual target behavior you’d like to habituate and then gradually working towards the goal.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Step-by-step, it looks like:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Quantify the aversive Action you would like to be able to do.<br/></strong>EX: “Every day, right after taking a shower, I want to write 1000 words.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Find a smaller version of the Action you can take without much resistance.<br/></strong>EX: “Every day, right after taking a shower, I will write 200 words.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Scale up gradually and consistently (For a schedule, weekly is a good default, but pick what works for you.)<br/></strong>EX: “Every week I’ll add 100 more words to my daily writing goal.”</p></li></ol><p style=""text-align:left;"">Scaling Up is simple, I know, and it’s not always clear exactly what the smaller version of the Action is. However, I stand by its role as a useful consideration in building habits. For things like homework, exercise, or coding, finding ways to get started at all is very good.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Too often, I think, we wrongfully look at actions and goals as all or nothing, and we get more easily discouraged when we don’t immediately hit 100%. Being able to Scale Up helps also bridge the gap between our expectations and reality. </p><p style=""text-align:center;"">++++</p><h2 style=""text-align:center;""><a href=""https://www.lesserwrong.com/posts/YFbDoKFrDN2xqF9Gf/instrumental-rationality-4-3-breaking-habits-and-conclusion""><em><strong>NEXT ESSAY</strong></em></a></h2></div></div></div></div></div></div>",,,,

It&#x27;s the stuff you know because someone told you about it. If you know the Earth is round because you read it in a book, that&#x27;s doxa.</p><p>Episteme is what we most often mean by &quot;knowledge&quot; in English. It&#x27;s the stuff you know because you thought about it and reasoned it out. If you know the Earth is round because you measured shadows at different locations and did the math that proves the only logical conclusion of the results is that the Earth is round, that&#x27;s episteme.</p><p>Gnosis has no good equivalent in English, but the closest we come is when people talk about personal experience because gnosis is the stuff you know because you experienced it. If you know the Earth is round because you traveled all the way around it or observed it from space, that&#x27;s gnosis.</p><p>Often we elide these distinctions. Doxa of episteme is often thought of as episteme because if you read enough about how others gained episteme you may feel as though you have episteme yourself. We discover this is not true, though, when we actually develop episteme of something we previously only had doxa of episteme of, like when we try to teach another person something and discover we didn&#x27;t understand it as well as we thought we did. Similarly, episteme is sometimes mistaken for gnosis because episteme may allow you to always get the expected answer the way gnosis usually lets you, but only so long as you put in the effort to reckon epistemologically.</p><p>Many rationalist thinkers focus heavily on episteme and the doxastic logic used to combine facts. This is fine as far as it goes: you need to be able to develop well-formed episteme from facts if you want to have much chance of <a href=""https://www.lesserwrong.com/posts/4ARtkT3EYox3THYjF/rationality-is-systematized-winning"">winning</a>. Humans are notoriously bad at episteme and it takes considerable training to become good at it, and episteme requires constant maintenance to remain accurate. We cannot hope to be rationalists if we cannot master episteme.</p><p>But there is something more if you want to walk the Way. It&#x27;s not enough to know about the Way and how to walk it; you need gnosis of walking. And I know this (doxastically, epistemically, and gnostically) from <a href=""https://mapandterritory.org/cognitive-empathy-and-emotional-labor-cb256c38597d"">listening to others describe their experiences</a>, <a href=""https://mapandterritory.org/inscrutable-ideas-c3211ee599af"">reasoning about epistemology</a>, and <a href=""https://mapandterritory.org/phenomenological-complexity-classes-8b41836437b9"">remembering my own experience</a> learning to walk the Way.</p><p>This would be a purely academic distinction if it weren&#x27;t for the fact that I see many of my rationalist friends suffering and finding consistently that those who suffer the most tend to be those with the least gnosis of rationality. And this is further complicated because those with gnosis do not always have the most episteme, so those more skilled at epistemic rationality may reasonably ignore the doxa of gnostic rationalists as confused at best and self-deceptive at worst. And so I find myself between a rock and a hard place because I see my friends suffering and I know (epistemically) how they can be helped but I don&#x27;t know (gnostically) how to help them.</p><p>All I know how to do is leave breadcrumbs for those without so much dust in their eyes that they can see the breadcrumbs well enough to keep following the Way when they find they are no longer walking it. This, however others may perceive it, has been the motivating goal, at least for me, with what we&#x27;ve lately been calling &quot;<a href=""https://drossbucket.wordpress.com/2017/09/30/metarationality-a-messy-introduction/"">metarationality</a>&quot;. That is, to figure out how to help our epistemically rationalist friends learn to be gnostically rationalist. <a href=""https://mapandterritory.org/"">My writing</a> and the writing of <a href=""https://meaningness.com/"">David Chapman</a>, <a href=""http://www.meltingasphalt.com/"">Kevin Simler</a>, <a href=""https://www.ribbonfarm.com/author/sarahperry/"">Sarah Perry</a>, and others is a way to gain doxa and maybe even episteme of our gnosis, but other than maybe <a href=""https://meaningness.com/metablog/meta-rationality-curriculum"">Chapman&#x27;s proposed curriculum</a>, we have not really found a reliable way to guide people towards gnostic rationality.</p><p>But maybe &quot;gnostic rationality&quot; is a better name than &quot;metarationality&quot;, and one more people can get behind. After all, I already see primarily epistemic rationalists engaging in practices to develop gnosis through things like comfort zone expansion (CoZE) and using the double crux in their own lives <a href=""https://srconstantin.wordpress.com/2017/08/30/gleanings-from-double-crux-on-the-craft-is-not-the-community/"">when the stakes feel high</a>, and gnostic rationality, by the very nature of being rationality, does not work without episteme enough to judge what may help you win and what may not. Thus it is not that anyone is seeking to go beyond rationality so much as fully engage with it, not just with our words (doxa) and minds (episteme), but also with our hearts (gnosis). This is the Way of gnostic rationality.</p></div></div></div></div>",gworley,gordon-seidoh-worley,Gordon Seidoh Worley,

<blockquote><p>Our world is filled with competition, frenzied ambition in every domain. In Western nations, and above all in the United States, it animates not only economic and financial life, but scientific research and intellectual life as well. Despite the tension and the unrest it brings, these nations are inclined on the whole to congratulate themselves for having embraced the spirit of competition, for its positive effects are considerable.</p>
<p><i>— Rene Girard, The One by Whom Scandal Comes</i></p></blockquote>
<h2>I. Eating Dogs</h2>
<p>Human life is all about competition, from the micro level to the macro.</p>
<p>We are built by genes that outcompeted their rivals over aeons of natural selection.</p>
<p>Children <a href=""http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1973-31267-001"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">cooperate less</a> and <a href=""https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED042532"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">compete more</a> as they grow older, even when competition is irrational. By the time boys and girls hit puberty they start mercilessly <a href=""https://qz.com/1027802/there-are-two-kinds-of-popularity-and-we-are-choosing-the-wrong-one/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">fighting for status</a>, in addition to competing for resources and attention. As people enter the world of dating and finding mates, the competition for status only intensifies. With dating having moved online, everyone competes for the attention of their beloved against thousands of other Tinder matches. And sometimes also with the <a href=""https://www.popville.com/2017/08/dating-in-dc-2017/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">5 other people</a> they set up a date with in the same bar. The winner takes it all, and <a href=""http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Nice%20Guy"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">nice guys</a> finish last.</p>
<p>We like exercise, music, and cooking. We like professional sports, American Idol, and cooking competitions even more.</p>
<p>Politics is war. <a href=""http://theincidentaleconomist.com/wordpress/the-three-languages-of-politics/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">The political right sees</a> a war between barbarous foreigners and a civilized America. The left sees a war between economic classes, or among a multitude of identity groups fighting to oppress each other. The Libertarian Party is the only one that doesn’t look at politics as being primarily about fighting someone and they consistently gain less than 1% of the vote, the losers.</p>
<p>Our education system emphasizes competitive admissions, exams, and grading on a curve. This is done to prepare students to compete in the job market and the economy.</p>
<p>Our economy is based on companies competing with each other in the marketplace. But if you think that employees in the same company will cooperate for the good of the organization then you haven’t been paying attention <a href=""https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2009/10/07/the-gervais-principle-or-the-office-according-to-the-office/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Ribbonfarm</a>: organizations merely set the stage for a Darwinian contest in which sociopaths possessing the will to win oppress the clueless and exploit the losers.</p>
<p>If you don’t spend your time thinking of ways to exploit people you’re probably a loser too. You should wake up to the reality of life as a competition and follow the example from the Dobu Islanders of Papua New Guinea, a society that embraced this idea completely and without reservations. Ruth Benedict and Sam Harris describe their culture, the epitome of taking this philosophy to the extreme:</p>
<blockquote><p>Life in Dobu fosters extreme forms of animosity and malignancy which most societies have minimized by their institutions. All existence appears to [the Dobuan] as a cut-throat struggle in which deadly antagonists are pitted against one another in contest for each one of the goods of life. Suspicion and cruelty are his trusted weapons in the strife and he gives no mercy, asks for none.</p>
<p>The Dobu appear to have been as blind to the possibility of true cooperation as they were to the truths of modern science. Every Dobuan’s primary interest was to cast spells on other members of the tribe in an effort to sicken or kill them and in the hopes of magically appropriating their crops.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>To make matters worse, the Dobu imagined that good fortune conformed to a rigid law of thermodynamics: if one man succeeded in growing more yams than his neighbor, his surplus crop must have been pilfered through sorcery. […] The power of sorcery was believed to grow in proportion to one’s intimacy with the intended victim. This belief gave every Dobuan an incandescent mistrust of all others, which burned brightest on those closest. Therefore, if a man fell seriously ill or died, his misfortune was immediately blamed on his wife, and vice versa. The picture is of a society completely in thrall to antisocial delusions.</p>
<p><i>— Sam Harris, <a href=""https://books.google.com/books?id=5FRW30QaDQwC&amp;pg=PA61&amp;lpg=PA61&amp;dq=sam+harris+dobu&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9-9dOeWans&amp;sig=Xl941au2AEd83XwDyW50IviaIcI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj7146KmPXUAhXF7D4KHWA4CmoQ6AEIVDAH#v=onepage&amp;q=sam%20harris%20dobu&amp;f=false"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">The Moral Landscape</a></i></p></blockquote>

<p>Huh, this doesn’t actually sound so great.</p>
<p>The problem with living in a dog-eat-dog world is that dogs just aren’t very tasty. But is it avoidable? Can you do well in life without trying to compete, dominate, and win anything? Can you even get a date?</p>
<p>I think so. Instead of eating dogs, we can try to bake pies instead.</p>
<h2>II. Baking Pies</h2>

<p>I disagree with all three guys, but only with the second part of the statement. Life <i>is </i>a game, but there’s more to playing games than trying to beat someone. To understand this game better we require some general theory of games. I suggest <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">game theory</a>.</p>
<p>Game theory distinguishes between <b>zero-sum games</b> which are purely adversarial and <b>positive-sum games</b> which allow for cooperation. “Zero-sum” means that any gain for one player means a loss for the other players. In a zero-sum game there are no win-win possibilities and thus no point in trying to cooperate.</p>
<p>Imagine someone emptying a bucket full of coins (for my tech savvy readers: an ICO of cryptocoins) over a busy street. Every person in the area now finds themselves engaged in the hilarious game of looking for quarters. All the players end up with a positive outcome in monetary terms (if we ignore dignity), but the game is purely zero-sum because each coin picked up by Mr. Black is one less coin available for Ms. White to find.</p>
<p>If we desire to live less like the Dobu we should learn to recognize zero-sum games and avoid them. The coin game gives us two heuristics for doing that. The first is that zero-sum games usually take the form of <b>dividing a fixed pie</b>. In our example, the “pie” was the bucket of coins dumped on the street. The players have no way to get <i>more</i> coins thrown at them, they can only compete for the coins that are already there. The second heuristic is that <b>each player is unhappy when more and better players join</b> the game. As more talented coin scavengers join, fewer coins are left for you.</p>
<p>In contrast, a positive-sum game involves a collaborative effort to which many players can contribute. Players <b>bake a bigger pie by cooperating</b>. In positive-sum games, the entrance of new participants is either bad or good for the incumbents, depending on the situation.</p>
<p>Let’s look at a more complex example from an arena that at first glance appears purely competitive – professional sports. Specifically, is the NBA a zero-sum or positive-sum game for LeBron James?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A single game of basketball is a relatively zero-sum affair, but athletes don’t join the NBA for the pursuit of basketball wins in a vacuum. They get many rewards for participating: money, fame, groupies, and the satisfaction of a basketball game played at the highest level. All of those make up the pie that NBA players bake together.</p>
<p>The title of “NBA Champion” is a yearly zero-sum game, but it’s an artificial format invented by the league. If the league could sell more tickets by having multiple concurrent champions or by awarding style points instead of titles, it would.</p>
<p>LeBron welcomes better players joining the league because that would increase the NBA’s prestige, popularity, and profits, of which he gets a share. In fact, in 2017 LeBron cost himself money by beating other teams <i>too quickly</i> – this led to fewer playoff games, which in turn decreased league revenues, <a href=""http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2717210-2017-18-nba-salary-cap-projection-reportedly-reduced-to-99-million"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">total salaries paid to players</a>, and subsequently the value of LeBron’s own contract. LeBron wants the league to be as good as possible, and the other players are collaborators rather than competitors in the bigger picture game of the NBA.</p>
<p>Of course, the NBA looks much more zero-sum to a marginal player. Unlike LeBron, a benchwarmer is <i>not</i> happy when more talent joins the league, they may end up taking his job. This points to another important principle of games: <b>strong players have more room to cooperate, while weaker players are forced to compete with each other</b>.</p>
<p>Let’s consider education, specifically going to a prestigious university. If you’re a borderline candidate for a university, strong applicants reduce your chance of admissions. Once you’re in, they make your grading curve steeper and compete for on-campus leadership positions and ultimately for jobs. Competing against stronger students <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/malcolm-gladwells-david-and-goliath-2013-10"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">can have demoralizing effects</a> that persist long after school is over.</p>
<p>This isn’t the case for the student who is much smarter than her peers. She <em>welcomes</em> stronger classmates. They improve her learning opportunities and increase the overall prestige of the university, without being a threat.</p>
<p>There are two ways to become a stronger player and “rise above the competition,” as it were. You can try to outwork everyone else, or you can look to be a bigger fish in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big-fish%E2%80%93little-pond_effect"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">a smaller pond</a>. Both options can work for a college applicant, although probably not as much for a basketball player. The NBA is the only game in town, and NBA players are presumably already working as hard as they can.</p>
<p>However, there’s another way to avoid the grind of competition: instead of being the <b>strongest</b> player, be the <b>strangest</b>.</p>
<p>If you possess a unique skill, it complements the skills of other players instead of competing with them. NBA players have built lucrative careers as “the guy who just blocks shots and <a href=""http://www.espn.com/photo/2006/0507/nba_a_wallace_395.jpg"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">has a sweet ‘fro</a>” or “the white guy who just stands in the corner and <a href=""https://cdn-s3.si.com/s3fs-public/styles/marquee_large_2x/public/images/kyle-korver-lead.jpg?itok=yTVk76Xy"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">makes threes</a>.” It’s enough to do only one thing well if that thing is rare.</p>
<p>But for avoiding competition, having unique skills isn’t half as important as having unique <i>desires</i>. The philosopher René Girard described the <a href=""http://www.iep.utm.edu/girard/#H2"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">mimetic contagion of desire</a>: people instinctively imitate the desires of those around them, which leads to everyone chasing the same prizes. These prizes often have no inherent value other than being the objects of shared pursuit. When those prizes are in limited supply, this pursuit creates zero-sum competition and leads to bitter rivalries.</p>
<p>The two ways of being similar reinforce each other. When people go after the same prizes, they will develop similar skills in the pursuit. When people’s skills don’t set them apart, the will try to stand out by competing ever more desperately for the common prizes.</p>
<p>We talked before about how prestigious universities set the scene for endless competition among the students at every stage of their education. Dan Wang ties this to Girard’s idea of competition stemming from similarity and mimetics:</p>
<blockquote><p>The closer we are to other people—Girard means this in multiple dimensions—the more intensely that mimetic contagion will spread. Alternatively, competition is fiercer the more that competitors resemble each other. When we’re not so different from people around us, it’s irresistible to become obsessed about beating others. […]</p>
<p>It’s hard to construct a more perfect incubator for mimetic contagion than the American college campus. Most 18-year-olds are not super differentiated from each other. By construction, whatever distinctions any does have are usually earned through brutal, zero-sum competitions. These tournament-type distinctions include: SAT scores at or near perfection; being a top player on a sports team; gaining master status from chess matches; playing first instrument in state orchestra; earning high rankings in Math Olympiad; and so on, culminating in gaining admission to a particular college.</p>
<p>Once people enter college, they get socialized into group environments that usually continue to operate in zero-sum competitive dynamics. These include orchestras and sport teams; fraternities and sororities; and many types of clubs. The biggest source of mimetic pressures are the classes. Everyone starts out by taking the same intro classes; those seeking distinction throw themselves into the hardest classes, or seek tutelage from star professors, and try to earn the highest grades. […]</p>
<p>No one has ever asked me how one should escape mimetic contagion on campus. Still here’s my answer: If one must go to college, I advise cultivating smaller social circles. Instead of going to class and preparing for exams, to go to the library and just read. Finally, not to join a fraternity or finance club, but to be part of a knitting circle or hiking group instead.</p>
<p>— Dan Wang, <a href=""http://danwang.co/college-girardian-terror/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">College as an Incubator of Girardian Terror</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Most of the prizes students compete for aren’t really worthwhile even when the temptation to compete for them is overwhelming. Is the point of attending college to be elected finance VP of some fraternity? College should be a place to have fun, get laid, make friends, learn something, and figure out which career suits your individual skills and tastes. These are mostly cooperative pursuits, and Girardian competition stands in the way of achieving them.</p>
<p>The <b>strongest </b>and <b>strangest </b>(e.g. knitting circle) students won’t get sucked into the competitive vortex. They’ll spend time in the library studying whatever weird subject they’re obsessed with, they’ll make friends with fellow geeks, and they’ll wonder why most of their classmates are perpetually miserable.</p>
<h2>III. Tits and Tats</h2>
<p>We have started building a framework of competitive and cooperative situations. Competition stems from zero-sum contests over a fixed pie, where additional players are never welcome. Cooperation comes from an opportunity to bake a pie collaboratively, and strong players are welcome if they contribute. Ending up in the latter situation requires being more capable than anyone else, or really different from everyone else.</p>
<p>This foundation is enough to survive in Harvard or the NBA, but it’s insufficient for a real challenge like OkCupid. For a strategy that works in online dating we need to dig deeper into game theory, and the one particular game that is most heavily theorized about.</p>
<p>The same way that biologists are supposed to study <i>all </i>living creatures but end up mostly focusing on <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_organism"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">mice and fruit flies</a>, so it is with game theorists. They’re ostensibly studying <i>all </i>possible games, but a huge chunk of the literature is dedicated to a single one, the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">prisoner’s dilemma</a>. There are many analogous framings of the dilemma, I prefer this simple, prisoner-free formulation:</p>
<p>You receive a widget with two buttons on it, labeled <b>“cooperate”</b> and <b>“defect.”</b>You are informed that another person somewhere in the world received the same widget. If you press “defect,” $1,000 will be immediately deposited into your bank account while the other player, whom you’ll never meet, gets nothing. If you press “cooperate,” the other person gets $3,000, but <i>you </i>get nothing except for a <a href=""https://www.someecards.com/usercards/viewcard/MjAxMy1iNzM1YjhkYjRlOWU2NDM0/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">warm feeling</a>. You both make your choices without knowing what the other person chose.</p>
<p>That’s it, that’s the game.</p>
<p>The salient feature of the prisoner’s dilemma is that choosing “defect” makes a player $1,000 richer <i>regardless of what the other player is doing</i>. In the absence of mechanisms to influence each other, this usually leads to both players defecting. Of course, if both players chose to cooperate they’d each be better off by $2,000.</p>
<p>The “strong or strange” principle applies here as well. A billionaire may be happy to let a random person take $3,000, so may the guy who lives out of a van and <a href=""http://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/features/athletes/alex-honnold/most-dangerous-free-solo-climb-yosemite-national-park-el-capitan/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">climbs giant cliffs without a rope</a>. The former has enough money and the latter doesn’t even need it to buy a rope. But for people who are neither very strong or very strange cooperation is difficult and defection is tempting.</p>
<p>This simple setup belies a rich universe of human interaction. In his book, <a href=""http://www.joshua-greene.net/moral-tribes/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Moral Tribes,</a>  psychologist Joshua Greene shows that most of our social intuitions and moral emotions evolved as means to cooperate in prisoner’s dilemmas with other people. <i>Empathy </i>and <i>compassion </i>allow players to cooperate by making it intrinsically rewarding to benefit others. The capacity to feel <i>self-righteous</i> or <i>guilty </i>signals a personal commitment to doing the right thing. Emotions like <i>tribalism </i>and <i>loyalty </i>allow cooperation to be enforced by a broader collective or by an authority figure.</p>
<p>The easiest way to achieve mutual cooperation is by repeated prisoner’s dilemmas played with the same partner. This allows each player to play <a href=""https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/evolution-the-self/201607/the-prisoner-s-dilemma-and-the-virtues-tit-tat"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">tit for tat</a> – reward a cooperator with cooperation in the next round of play, and defect against a defector. <i>Tit for tat</i> is implemented in nature by everyone <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocal_altruism"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">from fish to birds to monkeys</a>. It’s such a useful cooperation strategy for Homo sapiens that we evolved a whole suite of emotions that help us implement it: <i>anger, trust, vengefulness, </i>and <i>gratitude</i>.</p>
<p><i>Tit for tat</i> works when you’re dealing with the same<b> few players </b>over <b>long time-frames</b>. The strategy doesn’t work if players don’t expect to interact in the future. The incentives of future cooperation or punishment lose their bite when dealing with large groups of players, or when those players are only concerned with immediate outcomes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What kind of game is online dating? It can be a short-term and multi-player game in which everyone screws each other (in the literal and good sense, but also in the figurative and bad sense). But if two people are trying to build a real relationship, dating needs to be a cooperative, long-term, two-player game. If that’s the game you’re playing, <i>tit for tat</i> is your strategy.</p>
<p>Now, it may seem obvious that finding a romantic partner should be a collaborative pursuit and not a hostile contest, but it’s not the <i>natural</i> approach. The way of dating in nature is spiky dicks.</p>
<h2>IV. Spiky Dicks</h2>
<blockquote><p>“Everything in the world is about sex except sex. Sex is about power.”</p>
<p>— Oscar Wilde</p></blockquote>
<p>Wilde’s famous quote summarizes all the research in evolutionary biology which shows that throughout the animal world sex is about competition, and competition is usually about sex. Animals may <a href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/game-theory-calls-cooperation-into-question1/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">cooperate with each other</a> to acquire food and avoid being eaten. But as soon as that’s taken care of, it’s back to vicious contests over mating.</p>
<p>We normally think of mating-related competition as happening among members of the same sex, particularly males. For example, male elephant seals fight so savagely for access to females that at the end of <a href=""https://stephenwhitt.wordpress.com/2009/09/14/wonderful-pointlessness/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">their mating season</a> 4% of males will have had most of the sex but 90% of males will carry scars and injuries from fighting. From Achilles vs. Paris to <a href=""https://www.sbnation.com/2016/3/30/11330390/dangelo-russell-nick-young-tape-iggy-azalea-cheating"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Swaggy P vs. D’Lo</a>, many a historic beef among men has started over a woman.</p>
<p>But the real action is in male vs. female conflicts. Those are no less violent, and often a lot more creative.</p>
<p>In several species of beetles, the males have evolved sharp spikes on their genitalia which anchor the female in place during copulation. Female beetles evolve more soft tissue in the copulatory duct to protect themselves from injury, <a href=""http://www.pnas.org/content/104/26/10921.full"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">which in turn leads males to evolve</a> ever scarier looking dickheads.</p>
<p><i><img class=""aligncenter wp-image-6059 size-full"" src=""https://206hwf3fj4w52u3br03fi242-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/wifl1.png"" alt="""" width=""461"" height=""400"" />Callosobruchus analis penis (beetle dick). Image credit: Wikipedia.</i></p>
<p>Ducks have taken this idea one step further, and then fifty more steps in <a href=""https://www.buzzfeed.com/kellyoakes/this-aint-a-scene-its-a-sexual-arms-race?utm_term=.mvy6mxGyE#.ixpg5PWd7"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">really weird directions</a>.</p>
<p>Instead of chocolate and roses, male ducks usually go for the “forced copulation” approach to dating. In response, female ducks evolved corkscrew vaginas, which made male ducks evolve spring-loaded foot-long corkscrew penises (with spikes on them, of course). Finally, female ducks evolved branching labyrinthine vaginas so they can send the sperm of a male they don’t like towards a literal and reproductive dead end.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.buzzfeed.com/kellyoakes/this-aint-a-scene-its-a-sexual-arms-race?utm_term=.mvy6mxGyE#.ixpg5PWd7"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Seriously</a>.</p>
<p>This sort of sexual arms race is the norm in the animal world. So far we humans haven’t sprouted spiky genitalia, our main weapon in inter-sex conflict is lying and deception. Members of both sexes pretend to be fitter and more faithful to their partner than they really are. Better pretense leads to better detection of trickery, which leads to ever more sophisticated lying. Eventually, people evolved the ability <a href=""https://books.google.com/books?id=eJutAwmKCPEC&amp;pg=PA341&amp;dq=%22They+evolved+self-deception%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi7hI305OjUAhVMPj4KHV50B7cQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22They%20evolved%20self-deception%22&amp;f=false"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">to convincingly lie to themselves</a>, all the better to fool others about their commitment and attraction to a potential mate.</p>
<p>This is as true today as it was on the savannah. In online dating <a href=""https://theblog.okcupid.com/the-big-lies-people-tell-in-online-dating-a9e3990d6ae2"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">men lie about their height and income</a>, women lie about their age and weight, and a quarter of profiles have <a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3111341/A-quarter-online-daters-use-Photoshop-improve-profile-pictures-singles-24-worst-offenders.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">photoshopped pictures</a>. And you thought the news was fake.</p>
<p>Bullshitting is a useful strategy for spreading your genes widely with a minimal commitment of resources, or for beating your roommates in a competition to <a href=""http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2015/08/tinder-hook-up-culture-end-of-dating"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">sleep with more women</a>. Most lies don’t survive beyond the first date, but they get a lot of people to go on that first date and get drunk enough to jump into bed with you. This is a very <b>short-term</b> and <b>multi-player</b> approach to dating, and some people assume that this is the only one.</p>
<p><a href=""https://medium.com/indian-thoughts/i-wish-i-was-single-in-the-90s-a8ca92b43c86"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Everyone</a> <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/26/style/modern-love-wanting-monogamy-as-1946-men-await-your-swipe.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">complains</a> that while online dating made it easier to get a first date, turning that first date into a relationship became a lot harder. Most dating advice answers this conundrum with “keep doing what got you the first date, just more and better.” This is dumb and doesn’t work. What gets you first dates is mass-appeal and lying. Those are defection strategies, they benefit the player while making dating harder for both the gender they pursue and the one they compete with. Online dating isn’t defective, it’s the players who keep defecting.</p>
<p>Getting one person to spend a thousand nights with you is the exact opposite of getting a thousand people to spend one. It requires playing the opposite kind of game: <b>long-term</b> and focused on a <b>single person</b> (<a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/08/living/okcupid-polyamorous-open-relationships-feat/index.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">or three</a>, but not fifty). The strategy in this sort of game is to play <i>tit for tat</i> to achieve mutual cooperation with the person you will eventually end up with. You can play cooperatively with that person <i>even if you haven’t met them yet.</i> In fact, your first shared goal is to find each other, and then build the foundation for a relationship that will make both of you happy.</p>
<p>The first step towards this is complete honesty. If the other person is so ambivalent about meeting you that an inch of height or a year of age would tip the balance, you probably won’t end up picking baby names together anyway. You shouldn’t lie on your profile even if everyone else does. The novelty of seeing someone who fulfills exactly what their profile promised will kick off your first dates on a note of pleasant surprise instead of disappointment.</p>
<p>But just being honest is not enough. In accordance with “stronger or stranger,” to avoid competing with everyone else for your partner’s attention, you have to be really irresistible or really weird. The latter is much easier and works just as well as the former.</p>
<p>OkCupid’s data shows that conventionally attractive profile pictures get far fewer messages than photos that elicit <a href=""https://theblog.okcupid.com/the-mathematics-of-beauty-51bd25ae9a75"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">strong positive and negative reactions</a>. As long as at least a few people really dig you, having a lot of haters is not to your detriment. When I started dating online, I wasn’t sure if I should use the photo below as my main profile pic. But when two women wrote me just to say that they would never date a man with a photo like this, I knew this was the right one.</p>
<p><img class="" wp-image-6064 aligncenter"" src=""https://206hwf3fj4w52u3br03fi242-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/wifl6.png"" alt="""" width=""341"" height=""399"" /></p>
<p>My goal was to make it easy for my as yet unknown partner to find me, so I made my profile idiosyncratic enough to filter out most of the users that weren’t <i>her</i>. Instead of a self-summary, I started the profile with a stupid poem. I mentioned all my esoteric interests like Bayesian epistemology. I listed several reasons <i>not</i> to date me. As I kept making my profile quirkier, the women it attracted were a lot more interesting to me.</p>
<p>Finally, I got my reward:</p>
<p><img class=""wp-image-6063 aligncenter"" src=""https://206hwf3fj4w52u3br03fi242-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/wifl5.png"" alt="""" width=""549"" height=""151"" /></p>
<p>The point of<i> tit for tat</i> is to defect against defectors (the 99% of women who aren’t really into me) and to cooperate with cooperators (the few who are). For profile design, this means scaring away the people who are attracted to you superficially and appealing to those who like your unique quirks. On first dates, it means cutting off those who aren’t ready to risk making a small commitment to you, and building something with those that are.</p>
<p>At the start of a relationship, the “defect” move is to go along on a few dates while swiping for other matches in the meantime. It keeps your own options open but does the opposite for the person you’re seeing. <a href=""https://medium.com/tinder-lovin/why-youre-still-single-dan-ariely-bf9ace2ce638"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">The temptation to do this</a> exists because the 1,000 potential people you haven’t met yet appear perfect in the fuzzy light of imagination, while the actual person in front of you has shown a wart or two. But mutual defection has costs: it prevents both partners from making the effort to build the relationship on a stronger foundation than just mutual lust. Without that foundation, the <a href=""http://www.myvitawellness.com/3-stages-love-hormones/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">lust hormones dissipate</a> after a couple of months and both people are back where they started, slightly frustrated and two months older.</p>
<p>Tit-for-tatting the first date mostly means going against common advice.</p>
<p>Everyone says to avoid heavy topics on the first date. But why would you waste time with someone with whom you can’t have a serious conversation about the meaning of life or the minimum wage? If these topics aren’t deal breakers, you should be able to talk about them with open-mindedness and humility. If they are, you should use them to filter out incompatible matches and get back to looking for the ones who understand labor economics.</p>
<p>Everyone says to avoid talking about your ex on the first date. Maybe that’s a good idea, but for an entire year while I was dating, I shared a one bedroom apartment with an ex-girlfriend. In New York City, it takes more than a broken heart to give up paying half-rent for a sweet pad. When I started dating again I didn’t feel comfortable bringing this up, but then I realized that I should talk about it unapologetically on the first date. I would ask my dates to trust me that this was a temporary habitation circumstance, not a permanent emotional one.</p>
<p>This confession actually worked to my advantage, it sent a strong signal that I have nothing to hide and there were no other shoes waiting to drop. The women who were willing to trust me reciprocated by telling me something embarrassing about themselves, and we turned an awkward situation into an opportunity to build mutual trust.</p>
<p>Everyone says to hold off on texting after the date, so as not to appear desperate. I assumed that if I had an honest and deep conversation with someone on the first date, she would have plenty of information about my value as a romantic partner without having to deduce it from the timing of my text. Waiting 3 days to text creates uncertainty, and in the cooperative game of dating <a href=""https://putanumonit.com/2016/02/20/018-dating_3/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">uncertainty increases the odds of defection</a>.</p>
<p>Instead of the 3 day rule, I went with the -1 day rule.  If I enjoyed the date I would say: “Hey, I really enjoyed this date! I’m going to text you tomorrow at 8 pm to see if you want to go on another one.” This is a <i>tit for tat</i> move. I’m clearly showing that I’m playing <i>cooperate</i>, and I set clear expectations for reciprocation. Because I let the girl know in advance when I’ll reach out, if I don’t get a reply relatively quickly the next day I can safely assume that she’s not interested, which saves me from <a href=""http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=ghosting"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">chasing ghosts</a>.</p>
<p>One piece of common wisdom that <i>is </i>actually true is that <a href=""https://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2015/01/09/the-power-of-vulnerability-to-create-intimacy/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">vulnerability</a> is <a href=""http://www.fulfillmentdaily.com/vulnerable-key-intimacy/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">the key</a> to <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/11/fashion/no-37-big-wedding-or-small.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">building intimacy</a>. And yet, very few people are willing to be vulnerable in front of potential romantic partners. Vulnerability is the ultimate <i>tit for tat</i> strategy: there’s a lot to gain if the other player reciprocates, and a lot of pain if they defect.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s possible to be <i>too vulnerable</i> on the first few dates, just as it’s possible to be too weird, too deep, too honest or too demanding. But in my experience, people are afraid of being too open much more often than they actually are.</p>
<p>The strategies above <i>do </i>often fail, in the sense of scaring someone away from a second date. But if they only “fail” in cases where the second date wasn’t going to lead to a tenth, that’s a feature. As with startups, if you’re going to fail you should fail quickly, and move on to someone who tits your tats.</p>
<p>And when those strategies succeed, they do so magnificently. If you lead off the first date with honesty, vulnerability, and commitment and the date turns into a relationship, the relationship will also be based on honesty, vulnerability and commitment. This is worth a lot when so many relationships are based instead on pretense and power games.</p>
<p><i>Tit for tat</i> doesn’t apply to all aspects of a first date. Where it doesn’t, just cooperate unconditionally. Take a shower, show up early, commute to the other person’s neighborhood, turn off your phone, offer to pay. Don’t be a spiky dick.</p>
<p>I learned those lessons over a couple of years a couple dozen OkCupid dates. Like every game, dating is a skill that improves with practice. With my <i>tit for tat</i> game and <a href=""https://putanumonit.com/2017/03/12/goddess-spreadsheet/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">with the help of a spreadsheet</a>, Bayesian epistemology girl and I <del>are getting married in the fall</del> <em>hopefully got married in the time between me writing this post and publishing it. If we didn&#8217;t, it&#8217;s going to be really awkward</em>.</p>
<h2>V. Fighting Moloch</h2>
<p>So far I’ve talked about how cooperating instead of trying to beat someone leads to personally beneficial outcomes. But there’s more at stake here than your next first date.</p>
<p>Mutual cooperation gets harder the more players are involved. At the extreme, a prisoner’s dilemma played by an entire society often results in everyone defecting against each other. As in the two person game, “defect” is any move by a player that nets them a small gain while imposing a large cost on others. Here are some examples of defections in society-wide games: sending a marketing email, using antibiotics, burning some coal, calling someone a Nazi online. The corresponding outcomes: pervasive spam, drug resistance, global warming, Twitter. These outcomes are common and tragic, so they’re known as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">tragedies of the commons</a>.</p>
<p>There’s a view that failure to cooperate on multiplayer prisoner’s dilemmas is the greatest threat to our civilization, or <i>any</i> civilization for that matter. This position is best articulated by Scott Alexander, who gave it a name: <a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Moloch</a>.</p>
<p><i>Moloch </i>is why, when <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malthusian_trap"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">food is scarce</a>, the animals (and humans) that breed and kill most efficiently outcompete and destroy those that don’t. <i>Moloch </i>is why governments <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_to_the_bottom"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">race to the bottom</a> and provide corporate welfare. <i>Moloch </i>is the force behind arms races, environmental destruction, and clickbait – competitions that leave every single participant worse off.</p>
<p>Humanity currently enjoys a moment where the resources available to us exceed our ability to exploit them. We can afford to engage in activities that aren’t part of a ruthless competition for resources: art, leisure, blogging. But once our capacity for exploitation increases – for example with the advent of smarter-than-human AI – art, leisure and blogging will become unaffordable luxuries.</p>
<p>Scott offers <a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">an escape</a>: transhumanism. The goal is to create <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendly_artificial_intelligence"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">something or someone </a>that shares our values, nd is so strong that it doesn’t have to sacrifice those values for the sake of competition.</p>
<p>I know, I know, this sounds pretty insane. Whether one thinks that this plan is feasible or not depends on many things, like one’s geographic distance from the Bay Area. But here’s the fun part – it’s a great way to fight Moloch even if it doesn’t work.</p>
<p>Imagine if we were trying to design a community of people devoted to cooperation, based on everything we learned about competitive and cooperative games. How should we approach this?</p>
<p>We would build a community dedicated to creating something new, a freshly baked pie. It would have to be a long-term project. It would have an important and purely collective reward at stake, like protecting against a common tragedy. It would involve a bunch of weirdos.</p>
<p>It would be something like transhumanism.</p>
<p>Transhumanism inherently creates a cooperative culture among those involved in it. The pursuit of an outlandish goal in the far future, like friendly AI, cryonics, curing aging, or hastening the singularity, is a remarkable way to turn <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/3h/why_our_kind_cant_cooperate/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">naturally uncooperative geeks</a> into a collective.</p>
<p>Does that make transhumanism sound like a religion? The two main faults of religions are that they turn their followers to violence against the outgroup, and that they untether their followers from reality. Encouraging their followers to cooperate and to think long-term is overall a positive aspect of religions. Transhumanists try to be attuned to the physical and technological reality, and the ingroup of transhumanism is the entire human species. As far as religions go, it gives you most of the good stuff with little of the bad.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s hard to join a community you don’t believe in just for the benefit of a cooperative culture. There’s another way to achieve the same goal: create that culture yourself.

They are not everywhere in the Centre.</p><p>It is not just cynicism, but a need for power.</p><p>There is something I&#x27;m going to call the Idealists journey, that I think turns some Idealists into Cynics.</p><h3>An idealist wants to change the world</h3><p>You an idealist notices something wrong with the world. It needs fixing and you are the one to fix it.</p><p>There are two paths you can go down. You can try and influence the centre and the stronger the centre the more tempting this is. Or you can try and influence the people. To influence the people you give them something, a new technology (like linux) or a new idea. You don&#x27;t know exactly what people will do with the new thing, so this seems like a risky idea. So you try and influence the centre.</p><h3>Power is in the centre</h3><p>In our capitalist, statist system power is in the centre. If you can grab some of it you can redirect some of it to the fix the problem you&#x27;ve noticed. Power being in the centre is not a fact of the world. For the majority of life&#x27;s history power has been decentralised, a tree mainly grew by itself, helped by the trees around it providing it shelter but also competing for resources. It didn&#x27;t need planning permission to grow or rely on a central bank to maintain liquidity in a currency so that it could take out a loan to pay for its resources. Centralization is an artifact of our current technology level, with <a href=""https://improvingautonomy.wordpress.com/2017/09/01/economics-of-autonomy/"">more technology we may be able to be more decentralized</a>.</p><h3>To get power you have to have influence</h3><p>So once you have decided down the central path you need to place yourself in the centre. People in the centre just don&#x27;t let other people come waltzing into the centre, psycopaths do not want to lose control and other Idealists need to be convinced that your idea is good. You need to convince them you should be in the centre in some way or for some reason. So you need influence.</p><h3>To get influence you have to be ruthless</h3><p>The more power you need the closer into the centre you want to go. So the more influence you need. Influence is zero sum, so you always have to be on the look out for people back stabbing you and you have to take those opportunities for influence that you get, even if it hurts other people. You have to make the consequentialist decision that hurting them is worth it to get to the power to get to your ideal.</p><h3>Once you have power you have to spend power to maintain it</h3><p>Everyone near the centre is playing this ruthless game. They are nipping at your heals. You can gain allies by giving them some bits of power or you can spend your time and energy trying to head off other threats. You have to be skeptical and afraid of new ideas in case they are plans to erode your power base. Paranoia lives in the centre.</p><p>So you do not have all the power you thought you would have to achieve your goals.</p><h3>You may lose the ability to be flexible</h3><p>Other people will use admissions of failure or being wrong as tools to bring you down. You cannot admit your mistakes quickly so you may be locked into a path you have chosen even if it is sub optimal because changing tack admits weakness and people lose trust. Eroding your power</p><h3>You may lose the time to think about what should be done</h3><p>Even if your are sure of fixing the problem, you may not have enough time to figure out how the power should be diverted to fix the problem. Because you need to work hard to maintain your power you cannot relax and be creative or find novel ways to solve the problem you have. You can divert some power to trying to solving your problem by delegating the problem, but you may just divert it to another Cynic in the making trying to get closer to the centre, so you may not get it solved.</p><h3>The Cynics curse</h3><p>This doesn&#x27;t seem like the good life. It is not relaxed or fun or happy. People should be able to trust other people and have time to be creative. The best worlds are ones where you don&#x27;t try to control the world and you don&#x27;t need to try to control the world.</p><p>This seems like the end of the Idealist&#x27;s path to a Cynics, but it is not all.</p><h3>You may oppose decentralization as it erodes your control</h3><p>So you maintain the current centralization of the world or even potentially make suggestions to strengthen centralization, so that you can gain more power over the world, so that one day you can make it a better place. This is the Cynic reflex trained from the skinner box of striving to get to the centre and achieve their goal.</p><p>There are good reasons to oppose decentralization, but you should be able to tell whether people have the Cynic reflex or legitimately think centralization is better. If both the positives and negatives of centralization and decentralized are discussed and not just given lip service, then you are in a good state. If decentralization is never discussed then it is likely you and the people around you have fallen into the Cynic reflex.</p><p>It is not their fault, the game made them this way. So don&#x27;t hate the player, don&#x27;t even hate the game. Hate the centralization that causes and shapes Cynic and makes the game occur.</p></div></div></div></div>",,,,

Bet I convinced no-one about those numbers. The odds against 01 - 09 - 15 - 19 - 25 / 01 - 07 being the true lottery numbers are about 140 million to one, so I must have been a fool to think you&#x27;d believe me. The odds that I decided to lie is far more that one in a 140 million, so it&#x27;s very unlikely those are the true numbers.</p><p>Wait a moment. Something is wrong here. That argument could be used against any set of numbers; and yet one of them was the real winning set. The issue is that probabilities are not being compared properly.</p><p>Let S=(01,09,15,19,25,01,07), let W(S) be the fact these numbers won the lottery, let L be the fact that I lied about the winning number, and L(S) be the fact that I lied and claimed S as the winning numbers.</p><p>So though P(L) is indeed much higher than P(W(S)), generally P(W(S)) will be higher than P(L(S)). That&#x27;s because while W(S) gets penalised by all the other values S could have been, so does L(S).</p><p>Note the key word &quot;generally&quot;. The sum of P(L(S&#x27;)), across all S&#x27;, is P(L); this means that for most S&#x27;, P(L(S&#x27;)) must be low, less than 140 million times smaller than P(L). But it&#x27;s possible that for some values of S&#x27;, it might be much higher. If I&#x27;d claimed that the winning numbers were 01 - 02 -03 - 04 - 05 / 06 - 07, then you might have cause to doubt me (after taking into account selection bias in me reporting it, the number of lotteries going on around the world, and so on). The connections with Komogorov complexity should be obvious at this point: the more complex the sequence, the less likely it is that a human being will select it disproportionately often (and you can&#x27;t select <em>all</em> sequences disproportionately often).</p><p>What if I&#x27;d claimed that I&#x27;d won that lottery? That seems like a 01 - 02 -03 - 04 - 05 / 06 - 07 - style claim. I&#x27;m saying that the 01 - 09 - 15 - 19 - 25 / 01 - 07 did win (fair enough) but that these numbers are special to me because I selected them. Here you should be more sceptical. But what if I linked to a few articles that showed me with a gigantic novelty check? It would still seem more likely that I&#x27;d hacked and faked those than that I&#x27;d actually won... or would it?</p><p>Let&#x27;s make it more personal: what if you yourself ended up winning the lottery? Or at least, if you&#x27;d got/been given a ticket, and a friend told you that you&#x27;d won. And then another. And then people started calling you up, and you looked up the information on website, and there were news crews around... Still, odds of 140 million to one. It&#x27;s still more likely that people are doing elaborate practical jokes on you, or that you&#x27;re in a simulation.</p><p>First of all, are you so sure of those odds on practical jokes? There are maybe a few hundred lotteries in the world, drawing regularly (not to mention the other games of chance). If the practical jokes are more likely, that means that every week, there must be thousands of very elaborate fake lottery winning jokes, including multiple people lying (possible), and faked news crews and websites (much less likely). Do you really think that thousands of those happened every week (and that this almost never makes the news)?</p><p>If not, then you must be prepared to face the fact that you might actually be a winner. But see what this implies: that a few conversations with friends, a minor browse of the internet, and some news crew-looking people are enough to subjectively overturn odds of <em>140 million to one</em>.</p><p>In a sense, this isn&#x27;t surprising: 140 million is roughly 2^27, so it should only take 27 bits of information to convince you of that. But those are 27 bits from a reliable source. Given the possibility for deception and manipulation, it still seems that you can believe incredibly unlikely specific events, given very small amounts of information.</p><p>What seems to be happening is that we have a background picture of the universe, built up by life experience, and we think we have a pretty reliable impression about things like how likely our friends are to be honest/pranksters/lazy pranksters/super-inspired super-hacking super-organised vicious pranksters. Our background picture of the universe has way more than 27 bits, so we&#x27;re not comparing &quot;I won the lottery&quot; with &quot;someone is pranking me&quot;, but with &quot;someone is pranking me and major things I thought I knew about reality are wrong&quot;.</p><p>What about the simulation possibility? Now, I don&#x27;t believe that the &quot;probability of being in a simulation&quot; is a <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1110.6437"">meaningful concept</a>. But let&#x27;s pretend it is. We already know that we can&#x27;t compare &quot;probability of winning the lottery&quot; with &quot;probability of being in a simulation&quot;, but instead with &quot;probability of being in a simulation and winning the lottery&quot;.</p><p>Now, that last doesn&#x27;t seem too unlikely, given a simulation. But that&#x27;s still not the valid comparison. It&#x27;s &quot;probability of winning the lottery + background experience of the universe&quot; versus &quot;probability of being in a simulation and winning the lottery + background experience of the universe&quot;. It&#x27;s that background experience that weighs heavily here. Sure, a simulation might be more likely to simulate you wining the lottery, but would it be likely to have first constructed a more conventional life for you, and then have you winning the lottery?</p><p>Knowing that you are in a simulation only matters if that information is useful to your plans. So we&#x27;re  not even talking about &quot;being in a simulation and winning the lottery + background experience of the universe&quot;, but all that plus &quot;and the future will be radically different from my current highly materialistic view of reality&quot;. The more it looks like the laws of physics are being followed, the more you should expect them to continue to look as if they are followed. And winning a lottery, though unlikely, is not a radical departure from physics. So the simulation hypothesis doesn&#x27;t get all that much of a boost from that fact.</p><h2>A conclusion?</h2><p>Tradition maintains that posts must be concluded by conclusions. This post doesn&#x27;t really have any strong ones, but here are some thoughts:</p><ul><li><p>Even if the dream/prank/simulation/everything-you-know-is-wrong hypothesis is <em>overall </em>more likely than event E, what matters is the probability of dream conditional on you seeing the evidence you&#x27;ve seen for E, and this can be much much smaller.</p></li><li><p>It doesn&#x27;t take much evidence for us to (correctly) believe <em>extremely </em>unlikely things.</p></li><li><p>One of the reasons for that is that we have background knowledge of the universe that provides a lot of bits of knowledge in our favour.</p></li><li><p>We&#x27;re not very good at estimating these kinds of probabilities.</p></li><li><p>If you have decent-seeming evidence that you won the lottery, you probably did: due to background knowledge, this evidence can be stronger than it seems.</p></li></ul></div></div></div></div>",Stuart_Armstrong,stuart_armstrong,Stuart_Armstrong,

<p>A few years back, I came up with a <a href=""/lw/mrp/a_toy_model_of_the_control_problem/"">toy model</a> of the AI <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_control_problem"">control problem</a>. It has a robot moving boxes into a hole, with a slightly different goal than it's human designers, and a security camera to check that it's behaving as it should. The robot learns to block the camera to get its highest reward.</p>
<p>I've been told that the model is useful for explaining the control problem quite a few people, and I've always wanted to program the ""robot"" and get an animated version of it. Gwern had a <a href=""http://www.gwern.net/docs/rl/armstrong-controlproblem/index.html"">live demo</a>, but it didn't illustrate all the things I wanted to.</p>
<p>So I programmed the toy problem in python, and generated a <strong><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sx8JkdbNgdU"">video with commentary</a></strong>.</p>
<p>In this simplified version, the state space is sufficiently small that you can explicitly generate the whole table of Q-values (expected reward for taking an action in a certain state, assuming otherwise optimal policy). Since behaviour is deterministic, this can be updated in dynamical programming, using a full width backup. The number of such backups essentially measures the depth of the robot's predictive ability.</p>
<p>The most interesting depths of planning are:</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>At depth 0, the robot behaves randomly.</li>
<li>At depth 3, the robot crashes itself efficiently, to avoid loosing too much reward.</li>
<li>At depth 6, the robot figures out how to get one box into the hole. The automated camera turns it off.</li>
<li>At depth 17, the robot finally starts to deceive/conceal/manipulate, by blocking the camera and pushing two boxes into the hole. <strong>Note that the robot's deception comes from the fact that its incentives are misaligned, <em>and</em> that humans tried to control it.</strong></li>
<li>At depth 18, the robot efficiently does the plan from depth 17.</li>
<li>At depth 20, the robot does the maximally efficient plan: blocking the camera, and pushing all boxes into the hole.</li>
<li>At depth 32, the robot has the correct Q-values for the maximally efficient plan.</li>
<li>At depth 45, finally, the Q-value table is fully updated, and the robot will take maximally efficient, and, if need be, deceptive plans from any robot/box starting positions.</li>
</ul>

I&#x27;ll use them to gesture in a research direction which I think may be useful; but, I could easily be wrong. This does not represent the current agenda of MIRI overall, or even my whole research agenda.]</em></p><h2>Converting Philosophy to Machine Learning</h2><p>A large part of the work at MIRI is to turn fuzzy philosophy problems into hard math. This sometimes makes it difficult to communicate what work needs done, for example to math-savvy people who want to help. When most of the difficulty is in finding a problem statement, it&#x27;s not easy to outsource the intellectual labor.</p><p>Philosophy is also hard to get traction on. Arguably, something really good happened to the epistemic norms of AI research when things switched over from GOFAI to primarily being about machine learning. Before, what constituted progress in AI was largely up to personal taste. After, progress could be verified by achieving high performance on benchmarks. There are problems with the second mode as well -- you get a kind of bake-off mentality which focuses on tricks to get higher performance, not always yielding insight. (For example, top-performing techniques in machine learning competitions often combine many methods, taking advantage of the complementary strengths and weaknesses of each. However, this approach leans on the power of the other methods.) Nonetheless, this is better for AI progress than armchair philosophy and toy problems.</p><p>It would be nice if AI alignment could be more empirically grounded. There are serious obstacles to this. Many alignment concerns, such as self-modification, barely show up or seem quite easy to solve when you aren&#x27;t dealing with a superintelligent system. However, I&#x27;ll argue that there is sometimes a way to turn difficult alignment problems into machine learning problems.</p><p>A second reason to look in this direction is that in order to do any good, alignment research has to be used by the people who end up making AGI. The way things look right now, that means they have to be used by machine learning researchers. To that end, anything which puts things closer to a shape which ML researchers are familiar with seems good. </p><p>To put it a different way: in the end, we need a successful pipeline from philosophy, to math, to implementation. So far, MIRI has focused on optimizing the first part of that pipeline. I think it may be possible to do research in a way which helps optimize the second part.</p><p>We wouldn&#x27;t want the research direction to be constrained by this, since in the end we need to figure out what actually works, not what creates the most consumable research. However, I&#x27;ll also argue that the research direction is plausible in itself.</p><h2>The Big Picture</h2><p>I started working full-time at MIRI about three months ago. In my second week, we had a research retreat in which we spent a lot of time re-thinking how all of the big research problems connect with each other and to the overall goal. I came out of this with the view that things factored somewhat cleanly into three research areas: <em>value learning</em>, <em>robust optimization</em>, and <em>naturalized agency</em>. [Again, this write-up isn&#x27;t intended reflect the view of MIRI as a whole.]</p><ol><li><p><strong>Value Learning: </strong>The first problem is to specify what is &quot;good&quot; or what you &quot;want&quot; in enough detail that nothing goes wrong when we optimize for it. This is too hard (since humans seem really bad at knowing what they want in precise terms), so it would be nice to reduce it to a learning problem, if possible. This requires things like learning human concepts (including the concept &quot;human&quot;) and accounting for bounded rationality in learning human values (so that you don&#x27;t assume the human <em>wanted</em> to stub its toe on the coffee table).</p></li><li><p><strong>Robust Optimization: </strong>We will probably get #1 wrong, so how can we specify systems which don&#x27;t go off-track too badly if their values are misspecified? This includes things like transparency, corrigibility, and planning under moral uncertainty (doing <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=543"">something other than max-expected-value</a> to <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1621"">avoid over-optimizing</a>). Ideally, you want to be able to ask a superintelligent AI to make burritos, and <em>not</em> end up with a universe tiled with burritos. This corresponds approximately to the <a href=""https://intelligence.org/2016/07/27/alignment-machine-learning/"">AAMLS agenda</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Naturalized Agency:</strong> Even if we just <em>knew</em> the correct value function and knew how to optimize it in a robust way, we don&#x27;t actually know how to build intelligent agents which optimize values. It&#x27;s a bit like the difference between knowing that you want to classify images and getting to the point where you optimize neural nets to do so: you have to figure out that squared-error loss plus a regularizer works well, or whatever. We aren&#x27;t to the point where we just know what function to optimize neural nets for to get AGI out, value-aligned or no. Existing decision theories, agent frameworks, and definitions of intelligence don&#x27;t seem up to the task of examining what rational agency looks like when the agent is embedded in a world which is bigger than it (so the real world is certainly not in the hypothesis space which the agent can represent), the agent can self-modify (so reflective stability and self-trust becomes important), and the agent is <a href=""https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-35506-6_22"">part of the world</a> (so agents must understand themselves as physics and <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00652"">consider their own death</a>).</p></li></ol><p>To storify: <em>AI should do X such that X=argmax(value(x))! </em><strong><em>WAIT! </em></strong><em>We don&#x27;t know what value is! We should figure that out! </em><strong><em>WAIT! T</em></strong><em>rying to argmax a slightly wrong thing often leads to more-than-just-slightly wrong results! We should figure out some other operation than argmax, which doesn&#x27;t have that problem! WAIT! The universe isn&#x27;t actually in a functional form such that we can just optimize it! What are we supposed to do?</em></p><p>In a sense, this is a series of proxy problems. We actually want #1, but we&#x27;ve done relatively little on that front, because it seems much too confusing to make progress on. #2 still cuts relatively close to the problem, and plausibly, solving #2 means not needing to solve #1 as well. More has been done on #2, but it is still <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1470"">harder and more confusing than #3</a>. #3 is fairly far removed from what we want, but working on #3 seems to plausibly be the fastest route to resolving confusions which block progress on #1 and #2.</p><p>What I want to outline is a particular way of thinking which seems to be associated with progress on both #2 and #3, and which also seems like a good sign for the philosophy→implementation pipeline.</p><h2>What is Robustness?</h2><p>(I&#x27;m calling this thing &quot;robustness&quot; in <em>association</em> with #2, but &quot;robust optimization&quot; should be thought of as its own thing -- robustness is necessary for robust optimization, but perhaps not sufficient.)</p><p>Robustness might be intuitively described as tolerance to errors. Put in a mathematical context, we can model this via an adversary who has some power to trip you up. A robustness property says something about how well you do against such adversaries.</p><p>For example, take <a href=""https://intelligence.org/2015/11/29/new-paper-quantilizers/"">quantilization</a>. We want an alternative to optimization which is robust to misspecified utility functions. A Bayesian approach might introduce a probability distribution over possible utility functions, and maximize expected utility with respect to that uncertainty. This doesn&#x27;t do much to increase our confidence in the outcome; we&#x27;ve only pushed the problem back to correctly specifying our uncertainty over the utility distribution, and problems from over-optimizing a misspecified function seem just about as likely. Certainly we get no new formal guarantees.</p><p>So, instead, we model the situation by supposing that an adversary has some bounded amount of power to deceive you about what your true utility function is. The adversary might concentrate all of this on one point which you&#x27;ll be very mistaken about (perhaps making a very bad idea look very good), or spread it out across a number of possibilities (making many good ideas look a little worse), or something inbetween. Under this assumption, a policy which randomizes actions somewhat rather than taking the max-expected-utility action is effective. This gives you some solid guarantees against utility misspecification, unlike the naive Bayesian approach. There&#x27;s still more to be desired, but this is a clear improvement.</p><p>Mathematically, an adversarial assumption is just a &quot;for all&quot;<em> </em>requirement. Bayesians are more familiar with doing well <em>in expectation</em>. Doing well in expectation has its merits. However, adversarial assumptions create stronger guarantees on performance, by optimizing for the worst case.</p><h2>Garrabrant Inductors as Robustness</h2><p>Garrabrant Inductors (AKA logical inductors) are MIRI&#x27;s big success in naturalized agency. (Reflective oracles come in second.) They go a long way to clear up confusions about logical uncertainty, which was one of the major barriers to understanding naturalized agents. When I say that there has been more progress on naturalized agency than on robustness, they&#x27;re a big part of the reason. Yet, at their heart is something which looks a lot like a robustness result: the logical induction criterion. You take the set of all poly-time trading strategies on a belief market, and ask that a Garrabrant inductor doesn&#x27;t keep losing against any of these forever. This is very typical of bounded-loss conditions in machine learning.</p><p>In return, we get reliability guarantees. Sub-sequence optimality means that we get the benefits of the logical induction criterion no matter which subset of facts we actually care about. Calibration means that the beliefs can be treated as frequencies, and unbiasedness means these frequencies will be good even if the proof system is biased (selectively showing evidence on one side more often than the other). Timely learning means (among other things) that it doesn&#x27;t matter too much if the theorem prover we&#x27;re learning from is slow; we learn to predict things as quickly as possible (eventually).</p><p>The logical induction criterion is a relaxation of the standard Bayesian requirement that there be no Dutch Book against the agent. So, the Dutch Book argument for the axioms of probability theory has an adversarial form as well. The same can be said of the money-pump argument which justifies expected utility theory. Bayesians are not so averse to adversarial assumptions as they may seem; lurking behind the very notion of &quot;doing well in expectation&quot; is a &quot;for all&quot; requirement! Bayesians turn up their noses at decision procedures which try to do well in any other than an average-case sense because they <em>know</em> such a procedure is money-pumpable; an adversary could swoop in and take advantage of it! </p><p>This funny mix of average-case and worst-case reasoning is at the very foundation of the Bayesian edifice. I&#x27;m still not quite sure what to think of it, myself. Philosophically, what should determine when I prefer an average-case argument vs a worst-case one? But, that is a puzzle for another time. The point I want to make here is that there&#x27;s a close connection between the types of arguments we see at the foundations of decision theory (Dutch Book and money-pump arguments which justify notions of rationality in terms of guarding yourself against an adversary) and arguments typical of machine learning (bounded-loss properties).</p><p>The Dutch Book argument forces a tight, coherent probability distribution, which can&#x27;t be both computable and consistent with logic. Relaxing things a little yields a wealth of benefits. What other foundational arguments in decision theory can we relax a little to get rich robustness results?</p><h2>Path-Independence</h2><p>These examples are somewhat hand-wavy; what I&#x27;ll say here is true, but hasn&#x27;t yet brought forth any fruit in terms of AI alignment results. I am putting it here merely to provide more examples of being able to frame decision-theory things as robustness properties.</p><p>I&#x27;ve mentioned the Dutch Book argument. Another of the great foundational arguments for Bayesian subjective probability theory is Cox&#x27;s Theorem. One of the core assumptions is that if a probability can be derived in many ways, the results must be equal. This is related to (but not identical with) the fact that it doesn&#x27;t matter what order you observe evidence in; the same evidence gives the same conclusion, every time.</p><p>Putting this into an adversarial framework, this means the class of arguments which we accept doesn&#x27;t leave us open to manipulation. Garrabrant Induction weakens this (conclusions are not fully independent of the order in which evidence is presented), but also gets versions of the result which a Bayesian can&#x27;t, as mentioned in the previous section: it arrives at unbiased probabilities even if it is shown a biased sampling of the evidence, so long as it keeps seeing more and more. (This is part of what saves Garrabrant Induction from my <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=815"">All Mathematicians are Trollable result</a>.)</p><p>Another example illustrating the need for path-independence is <a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Pascal&#x27;s_mugging"">Pascal&#x27;s Mugging</a>. If your utility function is unbounded and your probability distribution is something like the Solomonoff distribution, it&#x27;s awfully hard to avoid having divergent expected utilities. What this means is that when you try to sum up your expected utility, the sum you get is dependent on the order you sum things in. This means Pascal can alter your end conclusion by directing your attention to certain possibilities, extracting money from you as a result.</p><p>It seems to me that path-independent reasoning is a powerful rationality tool which I don&#x27;t yet fully understand.</p><h2>Nuke Goodhart’s Law From Orbit</h2><p><em>(</em><a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/08/20/paths-forward-on-berkeley-culture-discussion/""><em>Repeatedly. It won&#x27;t stay down.</em></a><em>) </em></p><p><a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1621"">Goodhart&#x27;s Curse</a> is not the <em>only</em> problem in the robust optimization cluster, but it&#x27;s close; the majority of the problems there can be seen as one form or another of Goodhart. Quantilizers are significant progress against goodhart, but not total.</p><ol><li><p>Quantilizers give you a knob you can turn to optimize softer or harder, without clear guidance on how much optimization is safe. If you keep turning up the knob and seeing better results, what would make you back off from cranking it up as far as you can go?</p></li><li><p>Along similar lines, but from the AIs perspective, there&#x27;s nothing stopping a quantilizer from building a maximizer in order to solve its problem. In our current environment, &quot;implement a superintelligent AI to solve the problem&quot; is far from the laziest solution; but in an environment containing highly intelligent quantilizers, the tools to do so are lying around. It can do so merely by &quot;turning up its own knob&quot;. </p></li></ol><p>Nonetheless, it seems plausible that progress can be made via more robustness results in a similar direction. </p><p>Something which has been discussed at MIRI, due to Paul Christiano&#x27;s thoughts on the subject, is the Benign Induction problem. Suppose that you have some adversarial hypotheses in your belief mixture, which pose as serious hypotheses and make good predictions much of the time, but are actually out to get you; after amassing enough credibility, at a critical juncture they make bad predictions which do you harm.</p><p>One way of addressing this, inspired by the KWIK learning framework, is the consensus algorithm. How it works is, you don&#x27;t output any  probability at all unless your top hypotheses <em>agree </em>on the prediction; not just on the classification, but on the probability to within some acceptable epsilon tolerance. This acts as an honesty amplifier. Suppose you have a hundred hypotheses, and only one is good; the rest are corrupt. Even if the corrupt hypotheses can coordinate with each other, the one good hypothesis keeps them all in check: nothing they say gets out to the world unless they agree very closely with the good one. (However, they <em>can</em> silence the good hypothesis selectively, which seems concerning!)</p><p>A solution to the benign induction problem would be significant progress on the robust optimization problem: if we could trust the output of induction, we could use it to predict what optimization techniques are safe! (There&#x27;s much more to be said on this, but this is not the article for it.)</p><p>So, quantilizers are robust to adversarial noise in the utility function, and the consensus algorithm is (partially) robust to adversarial hypotheses in its search space. Imagine a world where we&#x27;ve got ten more things like that. This seems like significant progress. Maybe then we come up with a Robust Optimization Criterion which implies all the things we want!</p><p>Machine learning experts and practitioners alike are familiar with the problems of over-optimization, and the need for regularization, in the guise of overfitting. Goodhart&#x27;s Curse is, in a sense, just a generalization of that. So, this kind of alignment progress might be absorbed into machine learning practice with relative ease.</p><h2>Limits of the Approach</h2><p>One problem with this approach is that it doesn&#x27;t provide <em>that</em> much guidance. My notion of robustness here is extremely broad. &quot;You can frame it in terms of adversarial assumptions&quot; is, as I noted, equivalent to &quot;use <em>for all</em>&quot;. Setting out to use universal quantifiers in a theory is hardly much to go on!</p><p>It&#x27;s not nothing, though; as I said, it challenges the Bayesian tendency to use &quot;in expectation&quot; everywhere. And, I think adding adversarial assumptions is a good brainstorming exercise. If a bunch of people sit down and try to come up with new parts to inject adversarial assumptions into for five minutes, I&#x27;m happy. It just may be that someone comes up with a great new robustness idea as a consequence.</p></div></div></div></div>",abramdemski,abramdemski,abramdemski,

But before I can really get at how to justify that intuition, I would have to start clarifying what different kinds of thinking there are.  I’m going to be reinventing the wheel a bit here, not having read that much cognitive science, but I wanted to write down some of the distinctions that seem important, and trying to see whether they overlap. A lot of this is inspired by Dreyfus’ <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Being-World-Commentary-Heideggers-Division/dp/0262540568"">Being-in-the-World</a>. I’m also trying to think about the questions raised in the post “<a href=""https://intellectualizing.net/2013/10/23/what-are-intellect-and-instinct/"">What are Intellect and Instinct</a>?”</p><p><strong>Effortful vs. Effortless</strong></p><p>In English, we have different words for perceiving passively versus actively paying attention.  To see vs. to look, to hear vs. to listen, to touch vs. to feel.  To go looking for a sensation means exerting a sort of mental pressure; in other words, effort. William James, in his <a href=""https://archive.org/stream/theprinciplesofp01jameuoft/theprinciplesofp01jameuoft_djvu.txt"">Principles of Psychology</a>, said “Attention and effort, as we shall see later, are but two names for the same psychic fact.”  He says, in his famous introduction to attention, that</p><blockquote><p>Every one knows what attention is. It is the taking possession by the mind, in clear and vivid form, of one out of what seem several simultaneously possible objects or trains of thought. Localization, concentration, of consciousness are of its essence. It implies withdrawal from some things in order to deal effectively with others, and is a condition which has a real opposite in the confused, dazed, scatterbrained state which in French is called distraction, and Zerstreutheit in German.</p></blockquote><p>Furthermore, James divides attention into two types:</p><blockquote><p>Passive, reflex, non-voluntary, effortless ; or Active and voluntary.</p></blockquote><p>In other words, the mind is always selecting certain experiences or thoughts as more salient than others; but sometimes this is done in an automatic way, and sometimes it’s effortful/voluntary/active.  A fluent speaker of a language will automatically notice a grammatical error; a beginner will have to try effortfully to catch the error.</p><p>In the famous <a href=""http://www.theinvisiblegorilla.com/gorilla_experiment.html"">gorilla experiment</a> where subjects instructed to count passes in a basketball game failed to notice a gorilla on the basketball field, “counting the passes” is paying effortful attention, while “noticing the gorilla” would be effortless or passive noticing.</p><p>Activity in “flow” (playing a musical piece by muscle memory, or spatially navigating one’s own house) is effortless; activities one learns for the first time are effortful.</p><p>Oliver Sacks’ case studies are full of stories that illustrate the importance of flow. People with motor disorders like Parkinson’s can often dance or walk in rhythm to music, even when ordinary walking is difficult; people with memory problems sometimes can still recite verse; people who cannot speak can sometimes still sing. “Fluent” activities can remain undamaged when similar but more “deliberative” activities are lost.</p><p>The author of i<a href=""www.intellectualizing.net"">ntellectualizing.net</a> thinks about this in the context of being an autistic parent of an autistic son:</p><blockquote><p>Long ago somewhere I can’t remember, I read a discussion of knowing what vs. knowing how. The author’s thought experiment was about walking. Imagine walking with conscious planning, thinking consciously about each muscle and movement involved. Attempting to do this makes us terrible at walking.</p><p>When I find myself struggling with social or motor skills, this is the feeling. My impression of my son is the same. Rather than trying something, playing, experimenting he wants the system first. First organize and analyze it, then carefully and cautiously we might try it.</p><p>A simple example. There’s a curriculum for writing called Handwriting Without Tears. Despite teaching himself to read when barely 2, my son refused to even try to write. Then someone showed him this curriculum in which letters are broken down into three named categories according to how you write them; and then each letter has numbered strokes to be done in sequence. Suddenly my son was interested in writing. He approached it by first memorizing the whole Handwriting Without Tears system, and only then was he willing to try to write. I believe this is not how most 3-year-olds work, but this is how he works.</p><p>…</p><p>One simple study (“<a href=""http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822%2813%2900207-8"">Children with autism do not overimitate</a>”) had to do with children copying “unnecessary” or “silly” actions. Given a demonstration by an adult, autistic kids would edit out pointless steps in the demonstrated procedure. Think about what’s required to do this: the procedure has to be reconstructed from first principles to edit the silly out. The autistic kids didn’t take someone’s word for it, they wanted to start over.</p></blockquote><p></p><p>The author and his son learn skills by effortful conscious planning that most people learn by “picking up” or “osmosis” or “flow.”</p><p>Most of the activity described by Heidegger’s <em>Being and Time</em>, and Dreyfus’ commentary <em>Being-In-The-World</em>, is effortless flow-state “skilled coping.”  Handling a familiar piece of equipment, like typing on a keyboard, is a prototypical example. You’re not thinking about how to do it except when you’re learning how for the first time, or if it breaks or becomes “disfluent” in some way.  If I’m interpreting him correctly, I think Dreyfus would say that neurotypical adults spend most of their time, minute-by-minute, in an effortless flow state, punctuated by occasions when they have to plan, try hard, or figure something out.</p><p>William James would agree that voluntary attention occupies a minority of our time:</p><blockquote><p>There is no such thing as voluntary attention sustained for more than a few seconds at a time. What is called sustained voluntary attention is a repetition of successive efforts which bring back the topic to the mind.</p></blockquote><p>(This echoes the standard advice in mindfulness meditation that you’re not aiming for getting the longest possible period of uninterrupted focus, you’re training the mental motion of returning focus from mind-wandering.)</p><p>Effortful attention can also be viewed as the cognitive capacities which stimulants improve. Reaction times shorten, and people distinguish and remember the stimuli in front of them better.</p><p>It’s important to note that not all focused attention is effortful attention. If you are playing a familiar piece on the piano, you’re in a flow state, but you’re still being “focused” in a sense; you’re noticing the music more than you’re noticing conversation in another room, you’re playing this piece rather than any other, you’re sitting uninterrupted at the piano rather than multitasking.  Effortless flow can be extremely selective and hyper-focused (like playing the piano), just as much as it can be diffuse, responsive, and easily interruptible (like navigating a crowded room).  It’s not the size of your window of salience that distinguishes flow from effortful attention, it’s the pressure that you apply to that window.</p><p>Psychologists often call effortful attention cognitive disfluency, and find that experiences of disfluency (such as a <a href=""http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~aalter/intuitive.pdf"">difficult-to-read font</a>) improve syllogistic reasoning and reduce reliance on heuristics, while making people more likely to make abstract generalizations.  Disfluency <a href=""http://sci-hub.cc/http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0963721413498894"">improves results</a> on measures of “careful thinking” like the Cognitive Reflection Test as well as on real-world high-school standardized tests, and also makes people less likely to confess embarrassing information on the internet. In other words, disfluency makes people “think before they act.”  Disfluency raises heart rate and blood pressure, just like exercise, and people report it as being difficult and reliably disprefer it to cognitive ease.  The psychology research seems consistent with there being such a thing as “thinking hard.”  Effortful attention occupies a minority of our time, but it’s prominent in the most specifically “intellectual” tasks, from solving formal problems on paper to making prudent personal decisions.</p><p>What does it mean, on a neurological or a computational level, to expend mental effort?  What, precisely, are we doing when we “try hard”?  I think it might be an open question.</p><p>Do the neural networks of today simulate an agent in a state of “effortless flow” or “effortful attention”, or both or neither?  My guess would be that deep neural nets and reinforcement learners are generally doing effortless flow, because they excel at the tasks that we generally do in a flow state (pattern recognition and motor learning.)</p><p><strong>Explicit vs. Implicit</strong></p><p>Dreyfus, as an opponent of the Representational Theory of Mind, believes that (most of) cognition is not only not based on a formal system, but not in principle formalizable.  He thinks you couldn’t possibly write down a theory or a set of rules that explain what you’re doing when you drive a car, even if you had arbitrary amounts of information about the brain and human behavior and arbitrary amounts of time to analyze them.</p><p>This distinction seems to include the distinctions of “declarative vs. procedural knowledge”, “know-what vs. know-how”, savoir vs. connaître.  We can often do, or recognize, things that we cannot explain.</p><p>I think this issue is related to the issue of interpretability in machine learning; the algorithm executes a behavior, but sometimes it seems difficult or impossible to explain what it’s doing in terms of a model that’s simpler than the whole algorithm itself.</p><p>The seminal 2001 article by Leo Breiman, “<a href=""https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.ss/1009213726"">Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures</a>” and Peter Norvig’s essay “<a href=""http://norvig.com/chomsky.html"">On Chomsky and the Two Cultures of Statistical Learning</a>” are about this issue.  The inverse square law of gravitation and an n-gram Markov model for predicting the next word in a sentence are both statistical models, in some sense; they allow you to predict the dependent variable given the independent variables. But the inverse square law is interpretable (it makes sense to humans) and explanatory (the variables in the model match up to distinct phenomena in reality, like masses and distances, and so the model is a relationship between things in the world.)</p><p>Modern machine learning models, like the n-gram predictor, have vast numbers of variables that don’t make sense to humans and don’t obviously correspond to things in the world. They perform well without being explanations.  Statisticians tend to prefer parametric models (which are interpretable and sometimes explanatory) while machine-learning experts use a lot of non-parametric models, which are complex and opaque but often have better empirical performance.  Critics of machine learning argue that a black-box model doesn’t bring understanding, and so is the province of engineering rather than science.  Defenders, like Norvig, flip open a random issue of Science and note that most of the articles are not discovering theories but noting observations and correlations. Machine learning is just another form of pattern recognition or “modeling the world”, which constitutes the bulk of scientific work today.</p><p>These are heuristic descriptions; these essays don’t make explicit how to test whether a model is interpretable or not. I think it probably has something to do with model size; is the model reducible to one with fewer parameters, or not?  If you think about it that way, it’s obvious that “irreducibly complex” models, of arbitrary size, can exist in principle — you can just build simulated data sets that fit them and can’t be fit by anything simpler.</p><p>How much of human thought and behavior is “irreducible” in this way, resembling the huge black-box models of contemporary machine learning?  Plausibly a lot.  I’m convinced by the evidence that visual perception runs on something like convolutional neural nets, and I don’t expect there to be “simpler” underlying laws.  People accumulate a lot of data and feedback through life, much more than scientists ever do for an experiment, so they can “afford” to do as any good AI startup does, and eschew structured models for open-ended, non-insightful ones, compensating with an abundance of data.</p><p><strong>Subject-Object vs. Relational</strong></p><p>This is a concept in Dreyfus that I found fairly hard to pin down, but the distinction seems to be operating upon the world vs. relating to the world. When you are dealing with raw material — say you are a potter with a piece of clay — you think of yourself as active and the clay as passive. You have a goal (say, making a pot) and the clay has certain properties; how you act to achieve your goal depends on the clay’s properties.</p><p>By contrast, if you’re interacting with a person or an animal, or even just an object with a UI, like a stand mixer, you’re relating to your environment.  The stand mixer “lets you do” a small number of things — you can change attachments or speeds, raise the bowl up and down, remove the bowl, fill it with food or empty it. You orient to these affordances. You do not, in the ordinary process of using a stand mixer, think about whether you could use it as a step-stool or a weapon or a painting tool. (Though you might if you are a child, or an engineer or an artist.) Ordinarily you relate in an almost social, almost animist, way to the stand mixer.   You use it as it “wants to be used”, or rather as its designer wants you to use it; you are “playing along” in some sense, being receptive to the external intentions you intuit.</p><p>And, of course, when we are relating to other people, we do much stranger and harder-to-describe things; we become different around them, we are no longer solitary agents pursuing purely internally-driven goals. There is such a thing as becoming “part of a group.”  There is the whole messy business of culture.</p><p>For the most part, I don’t think machine-learning models today are able to do either subject-object or relational thinking; the problems they’re solving are so simple that neither paradigm seems to apply.  “Learn how to work a stand mixer” or “Figure out how to make a pot out of clay” both seem beyond the reach of any artificial intelligence we have today.</p><p><strong>Aware vs. Unaware</strong></p><p>This is the difference between sight and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindsight"">blindsight</a>.  It’s been shown that we can act on the basis of information that we don’t know we have. Some blind people are much better than chance at guessing where a visual stimulus is, even though they claim sincerely to be unable to see it.  Being primed by a cue makes blindsight more accurate — in other words, you can have attention without awareness.</p><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anosognosia"">Anosognosia</a> is another window into awareness; it is the phenomenon when disabled people are not aware of their deficits (which may be motor, sensory, speech-related, or memory-related.) In unilateral neglect, for instance, a stroke victim might be unaware that she has a left side of her body; she won’t eat the left half of her plate, make up the left side of her face, etc.  Sensations may still be possible on the left side, but she won’t be aware of them.  Squirting cold water in the left ear can temporarily fix this, for unknown reasons.</p><p>Awareness doesn’t need to be explicit or declarative; we aren’t formalizing words or systems constantly when we go through ordinary waking life.  It also doesn’t need to be effortful attention; we’re still aware of the sights and sounds that enter our attention spontaneously.</p><p><a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698912003616"">Efference copy signals </a> seem to provide a clue to what’s going on in awareness.  When we act (such as to move a limb), we produce an “efference copy” of what we expect our sensory experience to be, while simultaneously we receive the actual sensory feedback. “This process ultimately allows sensory reafferents from motor outputs to be recognized as self-generated and therefore not requiring further sensory or cognitive processing of the feedback they produce.”  This is what allows you to keep a ‘still’ picture of the world even though your eyes are constantly moving, and to tune out the sensations from your own movements and the sound of your own voice.</p><p>Schizophrenics may be experiencing a dysfunction of this self-monitoring system; they have “delusions of passivity or thought insertion” (believing that their movements or thoughts are controlled from outside) or “delusions of grandeur or reference” (believing that they control things with their minds that they couldn’t possibly control, or that things in the outside world are “about” themselves when they aren’t.) They have a problem distinguishing self-caused from externally-caused stimuli.</p><p>We’re probably keeping track, somewhere in our minds, of things labeled as “me” and “not me” (my limbs are part of me, the table next to me is not), sensations that are self-caused and externally-caused, and maybe also experiences that we label as “ours” vs. not (we remember them, they feel like they happened to us, we can attest to them, we believe they were real rather than fantasies.)</p><p>It might be as simple as just making a parallel copy of information labeled “self,” as the efference-copy theory has it.  And (probably in a variety of complicated and as-yet-unknown ways), our brains treat things differently when they are tagged as “self” vs. “other.”</p><p>Maybe when experiences are tagged as “self” or labeled as memories, we are aware that they are happening to us.  Maybe we have a “Cartesian theater” somewhere in our brain, through which all experiences we’re aware of pass, while the unconscious experiences can still affect our behavior directly.  This is all speculation, though.</p><p>I’m pretty sure that current robots or ML systems don’t have any special distinction between experiences inside and outside of awareness, which means that for all practical purposes they’re always operating on blindsight.</p><p><strong>Relationships and Corollaries</strong></p><p>I think that, in order of the proportion of ordinary neurotypical adult life they take up, awareness  &gt; effortful attention &gt; explicit systematic thought. When you look out the window of a train, you are aware of what you see, but not using effortful attention or thinking systematically.  When you are mountain-climbing, you are using effortful attention, but not thinking systematically very much. When you are writing an essay or a proof, you are using effortful attention, and using systematic thought more, though perhaps not exclusively.</p><p>I think awareness, in humans, is necessary for effortful attention, and effortful attention is usually involved in systematic thought.  (For example, notice how concentration and cognitive disfluency improve the ability to generalize or follow reasoning principles.) . I don’t know whether those necessary conditions hold in principle, but they seem to hold in practice.</p><p>Which means that, since present-day machine-learners aren’t aware, there’s reason to doubt that they’re going to be much good at what we’d call reasoning.</p><p>I don’t think classic planning algorithms “can reason” either; they’re hard-coding in the procedures they follow, rather than generating those procedures from simpler percepts the way we do.  It seems like the same sort of misunderstanding as it would be to claim a camera can see.</p><p>(As I’ve <a href=""https://srconstantin.wordpress.com/2017/02/21/strong-ai-isnt-here-yet/"">said before</a>, I don’t believe anything like “machines will never be able to think the way we do”, only that they’re not doing so now.)</p><p><strong>The Weirdness of Thinking on Purpose</strong></p><p>It’s popular these days to “debunk” the importance of the “intellect” side of “intellect vs. instinct” thinking.  To point out that we aren’t always rational (true), are rarely thinking effortfully or explicitly (also true), can’t usually reduce our cognitive processes to formal systems (also true), and can be deeply affected by subconscious or subliminal processes (probably true).</p><p>Frequently, this debunking comes with a side order of sneer, whether at the defunct “Enlightenment” or “authoritarian high-modernist” notion that everything in the mind can be systematized, or at the process of abstract/deliberate thought itself and the people who like it.  Jonathan Haidt’s lecture on “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kI1wQswRVaU"">The Rationalist Delusion</a>” is a good example of this kind of sneer.</p><p>The problem with the popular “debunking reason” frame is that it distracts us from noticing that the actual process of reasoning, as practiced by humans, is a phenomenon we don’t understand very well yet.  Sure, Descartes may have thought he had it all figured out, and he was wrong; but thinking still exists even after you have rejected naive rationalism, and it’s a mistake to assume it’s the “easy part” to understand. Deliberative thinking, I would guess, is the hard part; that’s why the cognitive processes we understand best and can simulate best are the more “primitive” ones like sensory perception or motor learning.</p><p>I think it’s probably better to think of those cognitive processes that distinguish humans from animals as weird and mysterious and special, as “higher-level” abilities, rather than irrelevant and vestigial “degenerate cases”, which is how Heidegger seems to see them.  Even if the “higher” cognitive functions occupy relatively little time in a typical day, they have outsize importance in making human life unique.</p><p>Two weirdly similar quotes:</p><blockquote><p>“Three quick breaths triggered the responses: he fell into the floating awareness… focusing the consciousness… aortal dilation… avoiding the unfocused mechanism of consciousness… <strong>to be conscious by choice</strong>… blood enriched and swift-flooding the overload regions… <strong>one does not obtain food-safety freedom by instinct alone</strong>… animal consciousness does not extend beyond the given moment nor into the idea that its victims may become extinct… the animal destroys and does not produce… animal pleasures remain close to sensation levels and avoid the perceptual… the human requires a background grid through which to see his universe… <strong>focused consciousness by choice, this forms your grid</strong>… bodily integrity follows nerve-blood flow according to the deepest awareness of cell needs… all things/cells/beings are impermanent… strive for flow-permanence within…”</p><p>–Frank Herbert, Dune, 1965</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“An animal’s consciousness functions automatically: an animal perceives what it is able to perceive and survives accordingly, no further than the perceptual level permits and no better. Man cannot survive on the perceptual level of his consciousness; his senses do not provide him with an automatic guidance, they do not give him the knowledge he needs, only the material of knowledge, which his mind has to integrate. Man is the only living species who has to perceive reality, which means: <strong>to be conscious — by choice</strong>.  But he shares with other species the penalty for unconsciousness: destruction. For an animal, the question of survival is primarily physical; for man, primarily epistemological.</p><p>“Man’s unique reward, however, is that while animals survive by adjusting themselves to their background, man survives by adjusting his background to himself. If a drought strikes them, animals perish — man builds irrigation canals; if a flood strikes them, animals perish — man builds dams; if a carnivorous pack attacks them animals perish — man writes the Constitution of the United States. But <strong>one does not obtain food, safety, or freedom — by instinct.”</strong></p><p>–Ayn Rand, For the New Intellectual, 1963</p><p></p></blockquote><p>(bold emphasis added, ellipses original).</p><p>“Conscious by choice” seems to be pointing at the phenomenon of effortful attention, while “the unfocused mechanism of consciousness” is more like awareness.  There seems to be some intuition here that effortful attention is related to the productive abilities of humanity, our ability to live in greater security and with greater thought for the future than animals do.  We don’t usually “think on purpose”, but when we do, it matters a lot.</p><p>We should be thinking of “being conscious by choice” more as a sort of weird Bene Gesserit witchcraft than as either the default state or as an irrelevant aberration. It is neither the whole of cognition, nor is it unimportant — it is a special power, and we don’t know how it works.</p></div></div></div></div>",sarahconstantin,sarahconstantin,sarahconstantin,

Maybe most of the time even, it&#x27;s hard to know, and even harder to create common knowledge on the topic because if it is so we don&#x27;t want to know, and tell stories to cover it up when it happens.</p><p></p><p>Back in the golden age of psychology, long before the replication crisis, the scientific method was understood very differently from today.  Effect sizes were expected to be visible with the naked eye, not just statistically significant, and practices such as IRBs, peer review and even the use of control groups were much more optional.  For instance, the original Milgram Experiment lacked a control group, bur instead of saying that nothing had been learned, or suppressing it on dubious ethical grounds, the psychological community investigated an enormous number of variations on the Milgram experiment in order to tease out the impacts of slight variations, which were statistically compared with one another.  </p><p></p><p>In 1965 Melvin J. Lerner discovered that experimental subjects disliked the people who they saw subjected to electric shocks.  This effect was alleviated when the experimental subjects were able to offer the presumed victims appropriate compensation.  Apparently, they wanted to make the situation fair.  Unfortunately, if they couldn&#x27;t make it fair with compensation they wanted to make it fair by claiming that the victim deserved it.  Lerner and others followed up with a series of investigations victim blaming.  They discovered that the phenomenon is pervasive, robust and measurable via psychological surveys.  When given a story about a date, higher scores in &#x27;Belief in a just world&#x27; are associated with a greater tendency to see whatever ending the reader is given as following with high probability from the earlier events even if the earlier events are identical while the endings differ.  </p><p></p><p></p><p>&quot;Might people on the internet  sometimes lie?...  If you’re like me, and you want to respond to this post with “but how do you know that person didn’t just experience a certain coincidence or weird psychological trick?”, then before you comment take a second to ask why the “they’re lying” theory is so hard to believe. And when you figure it out, tell me, because I really want to know.&quot;</p><p></p><p>-- Slate Star Codex, 12/12/2016</p><p></p><p></p><p>One advantage of just world belief is that it makes it much easier to believe anything at all.  If lying is common, and is typically rewarded, the supposed facts out of which one makes sense of the world are called into much greater uncertainty.  If you can&#x27;t trust the apparently expert authorities who you grow up with to inculcate you into the truth, or the best approximation available, the process of seeking career advancement decouples almost entirely from the process of understanding, and the world appears far less knowable.  </p><p></p><p>A number of the scientific concepts discussed in this year&#x27;s essays seem to me to be specific corrections to the Just World Hypothesis.  Stigler&#x27;s Law of Eponymy, for instance, could be seen as the assertion that mathematical attribution is unjust, even on those occasions when historical scholarship enables objective investigation.  The Fundamental Attribution Error is the error of believing that in the typical case the career and social paths that lead to power will select for and cultivate justice, rather than selecting against them, and thus that the right person could ascend in power without acting unjustly, or perhaps that someone could act unjustly for years in order to ascend in power only to turn around and behave justly due to dispositional factors once power is achieved.  As an intellectual, or in almost any social context involving discussion, a person without the need for closure might appear hopelessly uninformed, uncooperative, and generally incapable of participation. </p><p></p><p>Without a just world, the hope of science, to gradually advance in a collaborative intellectual project, updating a shared set of beliefs appears chimerical.  One might face, for instance, a crisis of replication during which the whole content of your field, the fruit of many lives of work, evaporates despite the community apparently making the strongest efforts to commit only type I errors.  In such a situation, one might be particularly determined to avoid the type one error of disbelieving in a just world, and with it the possibility of joint intellectual endeavor. If this is the case, deliberate ignorance of an unjust world, rather than Bayesian updating of one&#x27;s belief on the matter, might turn out to be the dominant strategy for participation in an intellectual community, whether it be an academic profession, political party, business or church.  </p><p></p><p></p><p>&quot;See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil&quot;</p><p></p><p>-- 17th-century carving over a door of the famous Tōshō-gū shrine in Nikkō, Japan</p><p></p><p></p><p>“In a country well governed, poverty is something to be ashamed of. In a country badly governed, wealth is something to be ashamed of.”</p><p></p><p>--  Confucius</p><p></p><p></p><p>&quot;If you see fraud and don&#x27;t shout fraud you are a fraud&quot;, but in a different context, &quot;You may not be able to change the world but can at least get some entertainment and make a living out of the epistemic arrogance of the human race.&quot;</p><p></p><p>--  Nicholas Nassim Taleb</p><p></p><p>As we can see above, Asia&#x27;s major spiritual traditions clash over whether to accept an unjust world graciously and compassionately turn a blind eye to the unjust, or to fight against it proudly with full knowledge that the way to power lies elsewhere.  Our own intellectual tradition seems equally divided, even within a single voice.  Signaling intensifies our difficulties, since in so far as others expect you to act in a self-interested manner, you may have to signal a belief in a just world in order to be listened to at all.  We should expect both the just and the unjust to collude in maintaining a belief in a just world, whatever the evidence to the contrary.  Essays that violate that expectation, such as this one, are Bayesian evidence for something, but one may have to think very hard in order to know what.</p></div></div></div></div>",michael_vassar2,michael_vassar2,michael_vassar2,

Many have complained that there is not a clear, public, <em>real</em> example you can look and learn from.</p><p>SilentCal put together the <a href=""https://www.lesserwrong.com/posts/mkM3MAagrfumSJepi/productive-disagreement-practice-thread-double-crux/wKh7QbKTSzBZiBzwr#wKh7QbKTSzBZiBzwr"">Productive Disagreements Practice Thread</a>, where people could post controversial opinions and then resolve them via Double Crux. There were a few good starts, although most of the examples didn&#x27;t end up very exhaustive. </p><p>I posted the following:</p><h3><strong>Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality should be displayed prominently on the front page of this site.</strong></h3><p>I chose that because it seemed likely to get into <em>some</em> messy differences in aesthetics and goals, while a) not being<em> too</em> intense a discussion that people&#x27;d be embarrassed to discuss publicly, b) actually being useful.</p><p>And another user, gjm, took me up on it. We had a pretty good discussion, and found an actionable common crux. The discussion here is long, but I think approximately how long I&#x27;d expend any serious disagreement to take to resolve.</p><p>I&#x27;m turning into it&#x27;s own post so it can be skimmed more easily.</p><h3><strong>GJM&#x27;s 1st Response</strong></h3><blockquote><p>Before getting into any specific double-crux machinery, I&#x27;ll briefly make my case. The front page here plays two obvious roles: </p><p>(1) it&#x27;s a natural entry point for established users wanting to see what&#x27;s new, and </p><p>(2) it&#x27;s a place others may encounter, perhaps after seeing some specific thing on the LW website and wondering what else there is there, or perhaps because someone said &quot;hey, there&#x27;s this thing called Less Wrong; you should take a look&quot;. So, how does having HPMOR prominently on the front page serve those two cases?</p><p><strong>Case 1 (established users):</strong> It&#x27;s taking up space that could be used for something else. Most LWers already know about HPMOR, and either have read it already or have decided they aren&#x27;t interested. It&#x27;s mentioned often enough (I think) that active LW participants are in little danger of never hearing of it. So here I think HPMOR comes out clearly but not hugely negative.</p><p><strong>Case 2 (newcomers of various sorts): </strong>What&#x27;s HPMOR-on-the-front-page going to do to these people? </p><p><strong>(a) Some people will be immediately put off by it.</strong> That&#x27;s bad if they would otherwise have become valued members of the community; it&#x27;s bad if it leads them to badmouth LW or rationalists to others; it&#x27;s neutral or slightly positive if they were going to ignore us anyway and just do so slightly faster, or if they would have tried to participate in the LW community but been annoying or stupid and this scares them off. </p><p><strong>(b) Some people will be intrigued, read some or all of HPMOR, and like it</strong>. That&#x27;s good if they would otherwise have bounced off; it&#x27;s neutral or slightly good if they would have been valued LW contributors anyway; it&#x27;s bad if they turn out to be annoying or stupid. </p><p><strong>(c)</strong> Some people will be more or less indifferent to it. By definition it doesn&#x27;t have much net impact on them. Here, everything depends on the relative numbers of these people, and how much we&#x27;d have wanted them to stick around here.</p><p>My guess is that we lose more potentially useful and interesting people -- especially if we attach some value to intellectual diversity -- than we gain, because I think most people who encounter rationalism via HPMOR aren&#x27;t finding HPMOR from the LW website and never will be.</p><p>Add to that the other consequences of having HPMOR on our front page (it takes up space that regulars could use better for other things, and it makes us look weirder to people who were never actually going to be LW participants anyway), and I think it comes out a clear net negative.</p><p><strong>So, what would change my mind? </strong></p><p>I could discover some other ways in which HPMOR-on-the-front-page makes a difference, and they could turn out to be very positive. </p><p>I could be convinced that the numbers aren&#x27;t what I expect them to be (e.g., that lots of possible future rationalists come to LW&#x27;s front page, would be intrigued by seeing HPMOR there, and would bounce off something more like old-LW). </p><p>I could be convinced that there are &quot;higher-order&quot; effects that matter in ways I haven&#x27;t thought of (e.g., people who would be put off by HPMOR are less likely to be interested in LW, even if HPMOR isn&#x27;t in their faces when they come there; I think this is probably true but don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a large enough effect to invalidate what I&#x27;ve said above). </p><p>I could be convinced that actually what matters most is how things are for regular LW participants (this might not be hard to convince me of) and that regular LW participants benefit on balance from having HPMOR take up a big chunk of the front page (this would be a harder sell).</p><p>By way of background in case it matters: I have been here since the Overcoming Bias days and in particular didn&#x27;t come via HPMOR; I have read HPMOR and enjoyed it.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Raemon&#x27;s 1st Response</strong></h3><blockquote><p>Thanks for the response. First, I want to clarify two separate questions at play:</p><p><strong>I. Should there be a giant front-page of legacy content?</strong> </p><p>My answer is <em>&quot;Yes, for new users, no for older users.&quot;</em> It&#x27;s more important for newcomers to see our best content than the latest discussions, and to have proper context when they join the latest discussions. Older users should see links to sequences they&#x27;re in the middle of reading, maybe a prompt to read the most popular or important things, but there should be some way to remove that prompt if the writing clearly isn&#x27;t for them.<br/><br/><strong>2. Conditional on #1, should HPMOR be featured there? </strong></p><p>This is what I meant to focus on.</p><p>I used to think LW should &quot;be accessible?&quot;, with a  main goal of &quot;raise the sanity waterline&quot;. Our weird ideas had to be translated into ways that the average person understood. (I thought similar things about EA). </p><p>Now I think that one-size-fits-all isn&#x27;t a viable strategy. I think communities need to specialize, and I think having a creative spark that drives a given community is more important than accessibility. I don&#x27;t think creative-sparks are transferrable across belief systems or aesthetics. (i.e. someone else could form a community with similar goals but with an academic aesthetic, or with a hippy-ish aesthetic, and it could work, but that spark wouldn&#x27;t work for us nor ours for them)</p><p>In some ways, the Sequence are a rehash of <em>Thinking Fast and Slow.</em> But TF&amp;S didn&#x27;t inspire a community, or do much to change people&#x27;s behavior AFAICT. People complain about the sequences being over-top-top and full of weird Eliezer-isms, but I assert that weirdness was essential to actually accomplishing something with it.</p><p>It&#x27;d be good for someone to translate our best ideas into forms that resonate with different aesthetics, but this requires a lot of skill, and is a <em>very</em> different task than &quot;strip out all the weirdness&quot;. And it wouldn&#x27;t be an appropriate goal for <em>this</em> site.</p><p>So the question reduces to: </p><p>1. What makes our community valuable? <br/>2. What is the spark that drives that value? <br/>3. Is HPMOR an essential part of that spark?</p><p style=""text-align:center;"">***</p><p><strong>Why is our community valuable?</strong> My answer: it produces <em>ambitious, careful, insightful thinkers</em>, and gives them a place to refine their ideas, with some context to help translate them eventually into things-that-matter-in-the-real-world.</p><p>I think most of the value comes from a smallish number of people (power law distribution) who produce the best insights, research, or concrete-stuff-happening-in-the-real-world. Secondarily, a larger ecosystem of people that help refine ideas that direct the community&#x27;s attention in useful ways.</p><p>So my core goals for the site are:</p><p> - Attract the sorts of people who either <em>are </em>intellectual heavy hitters who could use a vibrant ecosystem to help build their ideas or focus their attention on the most important problems<br/> - Attract the sort of people who could <em>become</em> heavy hitters, or who help contribute to the facilitating environment.<br/> - Filter things such that the people who who produce the most insights have an easy time interacting with each other, or reading ideas that funnel themselves into real-world output.</p><p><strong>Ambition and Insight</strong></p><p>The Sequences are fairly good at both (although the ambition isn&#x27;t as apparent till about halfway through). What HPMOR is good for is painting a vivid picture of what it&#x27;d be like, to be a person who cared deeply about the world, and about thinking, and then actually trying to do stuff.</p><p>I should note: there&#x27;s a <strong>major failure mode if you </strong><strong><em>just</em></strong><strong> rely on HPMOR</strong> for ambition: it <em>also</em> attracts the sort of person who likes fanfiction, who gets excited by ideas but then doesn&#x27;t put in the (less viscerally exciting) work of research and thinking over the course of years. </p><p>There&#x27;s a fantasy series,<em> &quot;The Steerswoman&quot;,</em> which is essentially about an order of rationalist-types. Unlike HPMOR, rationality doesn&#x27;t give them super powers. It just... makes them slightly better at noticing things, and integrating evidence. </p><p>This is a <em>much more realistic</em> take, and I think it&#x27;s useful to bring people back down to Earth re: <em>&quot;what should I actually expect rationality to do for me, how exciting should I expect things to be, and how long does it take to get good?&quot;.</em>  But I still think having HPMOR for an initial flash of inspiration is valuable (for the people it works for).</p><p><strong>What is the Creative Spark here?</strong></p><p>Fully exploring this is beyond scope, but I do think an important part of the LW Spark (seeded by Eliezer) is seeing past traditional intellectual authority/hierarchy and thinking for yourself. I think the idea front-page of the site demonstrates the intellectual value here, while putting up a (slight) barrier for the sort of person who cares too much about traditional prestige. </p><p>That said, I do acknowledge it&#x27;s very possible (perhaps common) to be the sort of person who sees past generic Prestige Markers, but is still allergic to fanfiction in particular.</p><p>I&#x27;m not actually attached to any of the current content (Sequences, Slatestar or HPMOR). There could be new writings that did their job <em>better</em>, that filtered people on the <em>true-underlying-thing</em> instead of the <em>true-underlying-thing-filtered-for-some-accidental-aesthetics-of-Eliezer</em>. </p><p>But writing newer/better content is very hard, we don&#x27;t currently have it, so for now the question is &quot;is it better to have this stuff, or not have it.&quot;</p><p><u><strong>So: My Actual Cruxes</strong></u></p><p>I think the cruxes you listed (i.e. how many people bounce off HPMOR, enjoy it, or are neutral?) are good, but incomplete. My version:</p><p>1. What is the ratio of &quot;<em>people whom HPMOR helps become more ambitious&quot;</em>, compared to <em>&quot;people who would otherwise jive with the aesthetic/spark here, who might deliver a lot of value, who wouldn&#x27;t deliver as much value elsewhere, but who are allergic to fanfiction or HPMOR&#x27;s style and so bounce off.&quot;</em></p><p>If there&#x27;s too much of the latter, I&#x27;d definitely change my mind.</p><p>2. Does HPMOR foster too many not-actually-ambitious fans who are more offputting than helpful to the ambitious environment I&#x27;d prefer? I think it <em>does</em> bring in that sort of person, but that it&#x27;s a fairly achievable task of filtering things such that they don&#x27;t clutter up the front page.</p><p><strong><u>Having said all that: Third Options</u></strong></p><p>In another thread, you convinced me that HPMOR as currently presented on the front-page is spending <em>disproportionate weirdness points</em> for the value it produces. I think there&#x27;s probably room to either replace it with &quot;<strong>Rationality Fiction&quot;,</strong> or something, that manages to be intriguing and let people know about it without having &quot;<em>fanfiction wtf?&quot; </em>being something people have to get past right at the very beginning.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>GJM&#x27;s Second Post</strong></h3><blockquote><p>(I&#x27;ll respond in not-specifically-double-cruxing mode first of all, and then move on to the crux-refining bit at the end. I shall note that arguably I could simply declare victory because you end up by saying that we should do something less visibly-weird than making HPMOR prominent on the front page, but arguments aren&#x27;t meant to be about winning and losing around here and as you&#x27;ll see when I return to the topic later I think our positions do still differ.)</p><p>OK, there&#x27;s some good stuff here and we can already identify some things we (not very surprisingly) agree on.</p><p>We are agreed that neither HPMOR nor any other &quot;legacy content&quot; should be taking up a big chunk of the front page for established LW users. (And I think we&#x27;re broadly agreed on roughly what the situation should be for those users.) So we&#x27;ve refined the question to: Should HPMOR be displayed prominently on the front page as it is shown to newcomers?</p><p>We are agreed that a community doesn&#x27;t have to be appealing to everyone in order to be useful, and that the LW community will probably never be appealing to everyone. In particular, we are agreed that &quot;some people will be put off by having HPMOR prominently on the front page&quot; is not on its own a strong argument against. (I think I&#x27;ve made it clear that that wasn&#x27;t my argument, and I think you understood that, but no harm in making it explicit again.)</p><p>We are agreed that if LW has value beyond merely being a fun place to chat (which ain&#x27;t nothing, but the ambitions were always higher than that) its value has something to do with helping people to become good thinkers who are effective in getting valuable things done. I think I might give some weight to goals less ambitious than yours, though; aside from trying to produce intellectual heavy hitters who Change The World, if LW helps a bunch of people to think a bit better in ways that are somewhat useful then it is doing one of the good things it is meant to be here for. And I think it&#x27;s at least possible that LW may do more good by helping lots of not-so-world-changing people a bit than by fostering world-changers. Obviously this is a side-issue, but in the context of the HPMOR-on-the-front-page question it may play the same role as a difference in moral values might in a discussion of (say) economic policy.</p><p>So, in this context you say: HPMOR is valuable not merely because it may attract people to LW or to rationality but also because it may change its readers for the better, inspiring them to combine rationality and ambition to improve the world. That&#x27;s a thing I hadn&#x27;t taken into account in my analysis, and in so far as it&#x27;s true it does give more reason to make it prominent because now we have to consider the scenario where someone arrives at the LW front page, the presence of HPMOR isn&#x27;t going to make a difference to whether they hang around, but it might affect how useful they are afterwards.</p><p>I&#x27;m skeptical about the strength of this effect -- I suspect the great majority of HPMOR readers are not inspired by it in a way that makes a substantial difference to their lives, and that those who are were probably already rationalist types before they read HPMOR -- but I&#x27;m aware that this is not based on any actual information. Is anything known about how many people who weren&#x27;t already rationalists have been inspired by HPMOR to make a serious effort at being rational and changing the world, and (even harder to find out) what they have actually done as a result?</p><p>The other thing I&#x27;d like to point out about this line of argument is that on the face of it it&#x27;s arguing for a proposition like &quot;HPMOR is valuable&quot; rather than one like &quot;HPMOR should be on the front page&quot;. (Hence my emphasis in the paragraph above on HPMOR readers who weren&#x27;t already rationalists.)</p><p>Then you move on to another couple of related arguments: that putting HPMOR proudly on centre stage is a way of saying &quot;here, we don&#x27;t care too much about traditional signals of prestige&quot; and that while it may make some people bounce off they&#x27;re mostly going to be people we don&#x27;t want here anyway because they care about the wrong things. Acknowledgement of the second of those was meant to be implicit in some of what I wrote above, but going back and rereading I see that that&#x27;s not very clear. Anyway, I agree that the first point has some merit but ... not very much. I mean, if someone came up to you and asked &quot;What are the most important ideas that distinguish LW-style rationalism from other ways of thinking, and how would you convey them to casual readers?&quot; I&#x27;m guessing that &quot;don&#x27;t pay too much attention to traditional prestige markers&quot; wouldn&#x27;t be that near the top of the list, and even if it were &quot;put some Harry Potter fanfiction on the front page of our website&quot; probably wouldn&#x27;t be near the top of the list of the ways to say it.</p><p>Perhaps at this point we&#x27;ve got something like the right consequentialist question to ask, and it goes something like this. Consider all the people who come to the LW front page without already being LW users. We are interested in five subsets of them, and the effects of them of having HPMOR prominently on the front page.</p><ol><li><p>People who see HPMOR there and take a look, and end up being inspired to be like HJPEV in caring deeply about the world and making a serious effort to think as well as possible so as to improve the world more effectively. Benefits: these people may improve the world; they may be good people to have around LW.<br/></p></li><li><p>People who see HPMOR there and take a look, who merely enjoy it, and who decide to hang around LW as a result. Benefits: these people may also turn out to improve the world, especially if LW helps them think better; they may be good people to have around LW. Harms: more of these than of the first set may turn out not to be good people to have around LW.<br/></p></li><li><p>People who see HPMOR there and are put off because they are attached to traditional prestige markers and HPMOR trips their low-status alarms, so they don&#x27;t hang around when they otherwise might have. Benefits: we lose some people who are less likely to be good thinkers. Harms: we lose the opportunity to help them become better thinkers.<br/></p></li><li><p>People who see HPMOR there and are put off because they specifically don&#x27;t care for fanfiction, even though in general they&#x27;re able to see past traditional prestige markers. Benefits and harms: we lose the opportunity to help these people and the opportunity for them to help us.<br/></p></li><li><p>People who see HPMOR there, think &quot;ha ha, these people are silly&quot;, and badmouth us to others as a result. Harms: while these people were probably never going to gain anything from, or contribute anything to, LW, their badmouthing may put others off.</p></li></ol><p>And then the question is: when we add up all these benefits and harms, how do they balance out? You reckon the wins outweigh the losses, pointing out 1 and 3 in particular but also acknowledging the harms from 2. I reckon the losses outweigh the wins, pointing out 3, 4, and 5 in particular.</p><p>Something like this is probably a double-crux. It&#x27;s not clear to me how useful it is, though. The empirical questions (how many people are there in each group? how much more ambitious are people in group 1? etc.) seem very difficult to answer, and weighing up the various costs and benefits is hard even conditional on answers to the empirical questions (how do we compare one person who&#x27;s a bit more ambitious to improve the world, with five people producing a little more low-quality chat in discussion threads?) and I worry that what we&#x27;ve done here is akin to the Fully General Answer to all questions about what&#x27;s best: you just look at all the consequences, and see which one comes out better :-).</p><p>Considering your point 1 does move my estimate of the net effect a little in the &quot;beneficial&quot; direction, but my previous estimate was that having HPMOR on the front page is clearly harmful on net and my current guess is that 1 isn&#x27;t close to being enough to change this.</p><p>Finally, I&#x27;ll note again that your &quot;Having said all that&quot; comment seems like it ends up quite close to my position; but I don&#x27;t want to overstate the extent of our agreement. I&#x27;m not sure that a similarly-prominent &quot;Rational Fiction&quot; box would be an improvement on the HPMOR box; anyone actually investigating will see HPMOR as soon as they do, and the other stuff that would be at the far end of the link is probably mostly weirder than HPMOR (and mostly lower in quality, too). My guess is that it&#x27;s also less likely to inspire than HPMOR is, so one of the more intriguing pro-HPMOR arguments gets weaker if what&#x27;s being proposed is a &quot;Rational Fiction&quot; collection rather than just HPMOR.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Raemon&#x27;s 2nd Response</strong></h3><blockquote><p>Cool. I&#x27;m going to attempt to wrap up threads where possible (avoiding this turning into a many-headed-hydra). I think we&#x27;re mostly in agreement about <em>what the problem is</em>. </p><p>Things that still stand out as worth noting:</p><p>&gt; <em>Arguably I could simply declare victory because you end up by saying that we should do something less visibly-weird than making HPMOR prominent on the front page</em></p><p>I want to push back a bit on &quot;declare victory&quot; being a thing that&#x27;s relevant here. (This is sort of semantic but I think it&#x27;s actually pretty important). A key element of Productive Disagreement is shifting away from &quot;someone gets to win&quot; to &quot;we get to figure out the right/true/most-useful thing.&quot; </p><p>And in this case I think we have similar enough goals that we&#x27;re actually able to do that (whereas in some disagreements, you have to recurse all the way to &quot;<em>do we even both believe in consequentialism?</em>&quot; or &quot;<em>do we even both believe in objective measurable truth, or on what counts as evidence about that?</em>&quot;)</p><p>&gt; <em>I suspect the great majority of HPMOR readers are not inspired by it in a way that makes a substantial difference to their lives, and that those who are were probably already rationalist types before they read HPMOR </em></p><p>I&#x27;m not sure about the total numbers either, but this point is very salient to me because HPMOR <em>radically</em> changed my life trajectory, when several previous &quot;why not change the world?&quot; type people and books failed to do so. I read HPMOR before sequences and am not sure what it&#x27;d have been like if it&#x27;d been reversed, but my sense is &quot;The Sequences are the System 2 content of LessWrong, HPMOR is the System 1 content.&quot;</p><p>&gt; <em>I&#x27;m guessing that &quot;don&#x27;t pay too much attention to traditional prestige markers&quot; wouldn&#x27;t be that near the top of the list, and even if it were &quot;put some Harry Potter fanfiction on the front page of our website&quot; probably wouldn&#x27;t be near the top of the list of the ways to say it.</em></p><p>I pretty much agree with this. Insofar as HPMOR is necessary to have easily-accessible, I think it is a solvable problem to make it look somewhat classier. (I&#x27;m not committed to replacing it with the &quot;rationalist fiction&quot; page, but I&#x27;ll note an advantage of that is if you aren&#x27;t trying to explain it in a single paragraph in a quarter-of-the-front-page, you have more room to set the context of why HPMOR exists and why to give it a second look if you have an allergic reaction to it)</p><h3><strong>Sum Consequences</strong></h3><p>(<strong>Or, converting this into an empirical question that&#x27;s answerable)</strong></p><p>I don&#x27;t think either of us would consider this definitive, but I think we&#x27;d at least both consider it <em>evidence</em> if a LW Survey attempted to solicit questions about how big an effect size reading the Sequences, HPMOR and Slatestar have been on people&#x27;s ambition, life goals, etc.</p><p>Doing this properly is tricky. The ideal version of it would be a legit randomized control trial that included people outside this community. I think that&#x27;s impractical, but it should be tease out <em>something. </em></p></blockquote><h3><strong>GJM&#x27;s 2nd Response</strong></h3><blockquote><p>I agree that it&#x27;s wrap-up time, so just a few comments on your few comments.</p><p>First, let me push back on your push-back on the &quot;declare victory&quot; comment. In the very same sentence as that comment I added: &quot;but arguments aren&#x27;t meant to be about winning and losing around here&quot;. Please don&#x27;t try to make it look as if I don&#x27;t appreciate this, when I&#x27;ve made it explicit that I do. Thanks.</p><p>The fact that you read HPMOR before the Sequences and found that it changed your life is very interesting, and is evidence for your inspiration theory (though obviously less evidence than it would be if someone else reported the same experience).</p><p>I agree that one advantage of putting the link to HPMOR somewhere less space-constrained is that you get to explain it better when it&#x27;s first seen.</p><p>And yes, I agree that we might get useful information from an LW survey if for some reason it prioritized this. Perhaps if no one but you reported having their life changed by HPMOR you&#x27;d change your mind; perhaps if 10% of readers did I&#x27;d change mine. I think it would be really difficult to get any handle on how many people see HPMOR on the front page, decide &quot;I want nothing to do with these people&quot;, and badmouth rationalism to their friends, from any sort of survey, but perhaps it&#x27;s fair to guess that the number who overreact so dramatically won&#x27;t be large.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Raemon&#x27;s Third Response</strong></h3><blockquote><p>&gt; <em>First, let me push back on your push-back on the &quot;declare victory&quot; comment. In the very same sentence as that comment I added: &quot;but arguments aren&#x27;t meant to be about winning and losing around here&quot;.</em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Yeah, I think my comment came across stronger/differently than I meant it to (and re-reading both your comment and mine I think that&#x27;s a mistake on my part). </p><p>I meant something like &quot;I see that we&#x27;re both arguing in good faith and trying to do a good thing, but it feels a little sad that the &#x27;victory&#x27; mindset from traditional debate is still lingering at all.&quot; </p><p>For comparison: there were multiple times when I wrote recent comments on Double Crux that I accidentally wrote &quot;your opponent.&quot; In both cases, you and I generally were approaching things in the right mindset, but I think it&#x27;s a good habit, when one notices creeping &quot;opposition-mindness&quot; to flag it and let it pass.</p><p>Rereading your comment I think that <em>is</em> what you were intended to do, I just didn&#x27;t initially read it that way. Sorry.</p><h4>Wrapping Up</h4><p>So it sounded like some final things potentially worth doing are:</p><p>a) Actually put some effort into operationalizing the survey thing. (It so happens that the survey is in-the-zeitgeist right now, but it looks like this year&#x27;s survey was already pretty long). </p><p>I <em>am</em> interested in talking to the survey-folk about doing something with this next year. It doesn&#x27;t feel pressing to me to continue with this in the immediate future but seemed at least worth considering.</p><p>b) Potentially, take what we&#x27;ve written here and turn it into something more easily digestible (or maybe just more easily findable) as a publicly-available transcript. (Basically, I think turning our series of comments into a single top-level post would be useful. Is that something you&#x27;d be okay with and/or interested in doing?)</p></blockquote><h3><strong>GJM&#x27;s 3rd Response</strong></h3><blockquote><p>Apology accepted, obviously.</p><p>I&#x27;ve no objection to making our comments into a top-level post. My only concern (which has nothing to do with its being our comments rather than anyone else&#x27;s) is that this would fall firmly into the category of discussion of the community rather than discussion of the things the community is about, and maybe that&#x27;s a thing we want less of rather than more.</p></blockquote><h2><strong>Final Outcome</strong></h2><p><em>[Edited in after Said&#x27;s comment]</em></p><p>The primary point of this post was to illustrate Double Crux, not to actually highlight the outcome of the discussion. (And I think it&#x27;d <em>probably</em> be better if discussion in comments didn&#x27;t weigh in much on the object-level-discussion here). <em>But</em> I do think a useful norm surrounding Double Crux is to end with a joint statement that both people sign off on, that summarizes the lengthy disagreement for the benefit of others.</p><p>So for the sake of demonstrating <em>that</em>, here&#x27;s my summary of the discussion. (Note: I have <em>not</em> actually checked in with gjm yet, although I am fairly confident I can write something we both endorse and will edit it if they let me know that I&#x27;ve failed)</p><blockquote><p><strong>Outcome Summary of &quot;Should HPMOR be on the Front Page?&quot;</strong></p><p>gjm and I ended up agreeing on the following:</p><p>1. Logged in users probably shouldn&#x27;t see all the legacy content that currently takes up the full front page. Our discussion focused on &quot;what should newcomers who have not logged into the site see&quot;</p><p>2. The underlying goal of LessWrong is to provide a hub that helps <strong><em>ambitious, insightful, careful thinkers/writers</em></strong> to grow in skill, collaborate, and ultimate share ideas that are important and epistemically sound. Because reality tends to follow power laws, making sure that we attract/retain/facilitate/enable the <em>best</em> thinkers is a core goal. <br/><em>[disclaimer: this is my view, I think gjm endorses it but might quibble on the exact wording]</em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>3. A core concern of gjm&#x27;s is that many people are put off by HPMOR, and (probably) comparatively few people would be actively attracted by it, making it net-negative.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>4. I agree with #3. Instead, my main concern is: I think HPMOR is valuable (in some ways moreso than the Sequences) for <em>making people more ambitious, and for making core concepts about rationality more emotionally salient. </em>I know in my own case, it radically changed my life trajectory and led me to focus on &quot;what are the most important problems in the world and how can I help?&quot;. I have a (loose) impression that at least some other people were similarly affected.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>5. There were many relevant factors to &quot;should HPMOR be easily accessible on the front page?&quot; but essentially the core question is &quot;how many [actively or potentially] ambitious, insightful, careful thinkers will HPMOR drive away, or rub the wrong way, as <em>opposed</em> to how many will either be attracted by, or helped to grow/reach-their-potential?&quot;</p><p>6. We agreed that <em>actually </em>answering that question is fairly hard, but that a reasonable first step would be, on the next LessWrong survey, constructed some questions designed to get at least an <em>some idea </em>of how many people were positively affected by HPMOR, and a how many were negatively affected. (Constructing this <em>properly </em>requires more effort and science than we&#x27;d probably commit time for, but gjm noted: &quot;Perhaps if no one but you reported having their life changed by HPMOR you&#x27;d change your mind; perhaps if 10% of readers did I&#x27;d change mine.&quot;)</p><p>7. Meanwhile, however, we both agreed that even if HPMOR is extremely valuable, the front-page can almost certainly be redesigned to <em>reduce </em>the &quot;ugh, fanfiction?&quot; reaction that some people might initially have. First impressions <em>are</em> important, and potential third-options like &quot;link to a general &#x27;Rational Fiction&#x27; section that <em>gives much more context </em>to HPMOR&quot; might be a superior option. (this option is not meant to be the best, simply a possible example pending further brainstorming)</p></blockquote></div></div></div></div>",Raemon,raemon,Raemon,

All these ideas are in sand.</p><p>---------<br/><br/>I used to compare the prices of Various Weekend Activities to the pricetag of one of my main hobbies (we&#x27;ll randomly call it &quot;Ballooning&quot; to keep it simple). I might pay $35 for a weekend of Ballooning, which would include lodging, delicious food and alcoholic beverages, classes and activities, and lots of one-on-one help. Other Various Weekend Activities tend to be... quite a bit more than that. You would think Ballooning events must be operating at a loss, but it turns out that they actually tend to MAKE money. So what&#x27;s happening here? </p><p>My guess is that money is not actually an efficient unit of exchange, as compared to social or community capital. When you buy things with money you are paying people a premium to do tasks they are not inherently motivated to do, often in situations that are not convenient for them. I can do my own dishes in the two minutes that I’m in my kitchen waiting for my tea water to heat up. However if I am paying someone, in most cases they have to schedule a large chunk of time and travel out of their way to my house to do a task they have no motivation to do except for the exchange of money. </p><p>People in communities generally have an inherent desire to contribute to their community. They are often already in a position to help. They are preselected for being interested in many of the sorts of tasks the community needs (e.g. a swing dance community needs swing dance instructors and swing dance music djs). They have social ties to the people they are helping, as opposed to being strangers. They gain social status by contributing and thus find it satisfying.</p><p>When I go to a Ballooning weekend I am not just spending $35. I may spend 3 hours washing dishes after a meal. I may spend 10 hours prepping material for a class, and one hour teaching it. I may spend 20 hours making items that are going to be given away. I may spend 3 hours at a meeting helping to organize the event. I may spend an hour on setting up or cleaning up. I may spend 5 hours working with a new person one-on-one.  </p><p>Sure, if I were to value my time at $20/hour, then my $35 Ballooning events would suddenly be a LOT more expensive! But with the exception of dish washing, which I view as “putting in my time”, these are all activities I enjoy to some degree, and they feel more like “participating in my fun hobby” rather than “doing work”.</p><p> I ENJOY making things that will be given to and treasured by my friends. I ENJOY working one-on-one with new people, and watching them fall in love with the things that I love. I ENJOY contributing to the community that means so much to me. If I could instead work an extra hour at my place of employment and then use that money to hire people to pack up… that’s not an exchange I’d want to make.  </p><p>And it’s not only time that can be bought more cheaply with community currency than with money. Physical objects can also be bought with the currency of community. Sometimes you can borrow an expensive piece of equipment rather than buy it. Sometimes I buy nicer equipment for myself, and I enjoy giving away my starter equipment to new people to help get them started. Sometimes items are more easily bought in bulk sizes that you don’t need, and you’d rather give away the excess than store it forever or trash it.

Introverts lose energy from social situations, extraverts gain energy. This is then elaborated into the I/E scale, where the sign of your energy change in social situations is mapped to an integer.

There is energy in a room, and I do pick up some of it. (Something like sqrt(n), or possibly 10-10/n</p><p>For energy loss, it is a function of how much I trust the person in the room I trust least; f(min(trust(p) for p in room)).

I have difficulty arranging that test, but preliminary data suggests that expectation was wrong; one person who I cannot relax around spoils things thoroughly.

Habits can help reduce cognitive load, allowing us to get through the day. Imagine if you had to explicitly weigh the pros and cons of behavior like flushing the toilet every single time you did them.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Making in-depth, reasoned decisions all the time can be very costly in terms of both time and attention. Habits allow us to compartmentalize certain behaviors, so that our energy and focus can move to other, perhaps more important, things.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">A frequent part of our lives, habits make up at least roughly 40% of our everyday activities, which thus makes them a strong candidate to target when we’re thinking about behavior change *1.</p></div></div></div></div><div class=""ory-row ory-cell-inner""><div class=""ory-cell ory-cell-sm-12 ory-cell-xs-12""><div class=""ory-cell-inner ory-cell-leaf""><div><img class=""ory-plugins-content-image"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*csWAREoFkPpfwLBmDhgQVg.png""/></div></div></div></div><div class=""ory-row ory-cell-inner""><div class=""ory-cell ory-cell-sm-12 ory-cell-xs-12""><div class=""ory-cell-inner ory-cell-leaf""><div style=""border:solid 1px;border-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.12);"" class=""ory-plugins-content-spacer ory-plugins-content-spacer-read-only""><div style=""height:55px;""></div></div></div></div></div><div class=""ory-row ory-cell-inner""><div class=""ory-cell ory-cell-sm-12 ory-cell-xs-12""><div class=""ory-cell-inner ory-cell-leaf""><div><p style=""text-align:left;"">Knowledge about exactly how habits work, how we can create new ones, and how we can remove old ones thus seems very useful because they represent a way of providing benefit continuously over time.

Context cues are typically external things in the environment, from people to sensory details to preceding actions.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Once the cue occurs, the <strong>response</strong> is generated.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">The response, also called the “action”, is the behavior that follows the cue. Responses are typically small, atomic actions, but there is some research suggesting that a series of actions can be “chunked” together into a unit that follows from the response *5.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">(However, we also know that actions which require more thought and conscious effort don’t become habitual, even when repeated in the same context *6. Thus, I’ll be recommending simpler responses when we get to creating our own habits.)</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">This [Context cue] → [Response] model is the core of how habits work.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">While this model might seem obvious or simplistic, I’d like to stress the usefulness of this definition. This model allows for much of what we intuitively label as “habits” to fit this template of [Context cue] → [Response].</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Here are some examples of how typical habits fit under this model:</p><ol><li><p>Ring! Your alarm shakes you awake. In response, your arm slaps the alarm, hitting the Snooze button, and you go back to sleep.<br/><strong>[Context cue]</strong> Shrill sound of alarm going off.<br/><strong>[Response]</strong> Turn it off and go back to sleep.<br/><br/></p></li><li><p>&quot;Hey!&quot; Someone asks you “How are you doing?” and you instantly respond with “Good, you?”<br/><strong>[Context cue]</strong> The words “How are are you doing?”<br/><strong>[Response]</strong> Immediately saying “Good, you?”<br/><br/></p></li><li><p>Beep beep! You open the car door and get inside. After stepping into the car, your hands are already looking for the seatbelt.<br/><strong>[Context cue]</strong> Opening the car door.<br/><strong>[Response]</strong> Putting on the seatbelt.</p></li></ol><p>Moreover, I think this model is important in that it stresses how much of our behavior <em>isn’t</em> directly under our control. It highlights how habits can be seen as a way of outsourcing our behavior to the environment.</p><p>There’s a very real sense in which the central point of control shifts from <em>internal</em> to <em>external</em>.</p><p style=""text-align:center;"">++++</p><p>But how exactly do habits form in the first place?</p><p>In simplified terms, the mechanism behind how habits form looks like this:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Perform an action that isn’t too complex.<br/></strong>EX: You floss your teeth.<br/><br/></p></li><li><p><strong>Keep performing the action in a stable context.<br/></strong>EX: You always floss your teeth after brushing.<br/><br/></p></li><li><p><strong>Your brain begins to make associations between the context when the action is performed and the action itself.<br/></strong>EX: &lt;Insert your brain activity here.&gt;<br/><br/></p></li><li><p><strong>Continue performing the behavior frequently in the context.<br/></strong>EX: Richard keeps up his flossing habit after he brushes his teeth.<br/><br/></p></li><li><p><strong>Over time, the entire habit loop becomes internalized and largely automatic.<br/></strong>EX: Richard ends up with a flossing habit.</p></li></ol><p></p></div></div></div></div><div class=""ory-row ory-cell-inner""><div class=""ory-cell ory-cell-sm-12 ory-cell-xs-12""><div class=""ory-cell-inner ory-cell-leaf""><div><img class=""ory-plugins-content-image"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*po4Z6ooeG7iVt04vmioM3w.png""/></div></div></div></div><div class=""ory-row ory-cell-inner""><div class=""ory-cell ory-cell-sm-12 ory-cell-xs-12""><div class=""ory-cell-inner ory-cell-leaf""><div style=""border:solid 1px;border-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.12);"" class=""ory-plugins-content-spacer ory-plugins-content-spacer-read-only""><div style=""height:44px;""></div></div></div></div></div><div class=""ory-row ory-cell-inner""><div class=""ory-cell ory-cell-sm-12 ory-cell-xs-12""><div class=""ory-cell-inner ory-cell-leaf""><div><p>Much of the actual complexity is in <strong>Step 3</strong>, where our brains are able to somehow store the information about both the context cue and response together. There’s a question here of “How are habits actually stored in the brain?”</p><p>There are two suggested mechanisms for how this actually happens: <strong>motivated cuing</strong> and <strong>direct cuing</strong> *7.</p><p>The first mechanism, <strong>motivated cuing</strong>, suggests that certain cues can cause us to act because we anticipate a reward as a result of our actions.</p><p>Thus, the cue itself brings to mind a sense of “desiredness” which leads us to act.</p><p>A good example is notifications on Facebook. Many people feel a nagging draw to click on the red notification button as soon as they see it, like a sort of mental itch they need to scratch. There’s a two-step phenomenon here, something like [See Facebook notification] -&gt; [Click on it].</p><p>Motivated cuing says that this is because past experience with the cue (i.e. the red notification icon) has led to rewards (i.e. information about online activity that involves you).</p><p>This means that one way habits could come about is by triggering a motivation to act when we experience <em>just</em> the situation itself (even if the accompanying reward hasn’t shown up yet).</p><p>So it sounds plausible enough. But how do know something like this is actually happening in the brain? One good piece of evidence is a classic study involving monkeys and juice that you might have seen in a different context.</p><p>Here’s what happened: We started with some monkeys, some juice, and a light. We trained the monkeys to push a lever when they saw the light flash, which would then reward them with the juice. When the monkeys received juice, we saw a spike of brain activity (as we might have expected).</p><p>Eventually, though, we saw the monkeys’ brain activity shift. Rather than spiking when they received the juice, we began to see the spike when they merely saw the light. In other words, the monkeys seemed to react to the context cue that signaled the reward rather than the reward itself *8.</p><p>Basically, this means that one way habits could come about is by triggering a motivation to act when we experience certain context cues.</p><p>However, I think the motivated cuing model is unsatisfactory for several reasons. Many of our routines don’t always have well-defined rewards, like folding laundry or drying off with a towel. Additionally, as we’ll see in the next section, rewards seem to have an overall negative effect on habit formation.</p><p>This is where the second model, <strong>direct cuing</strong>, comes in. Direct cuing suggests that when we perform the same actions often enough, one after another, a link will form between them.</p><p>For example, consistently putting on the seatbelt after getting into the car can lead to an association forming as we chunk the two actions in our brains, one after another. Thus, once we get into the car, our next automatic step is to look for the seatbelt.</p><p>Other simple actions are things like tying our shoelaces right after we put on our shoes or using the same conversation starters (EX: “Have you seen anything good lately?”) with the same friend again and again.</p><p>In direct cuing, the most important consideration is <em>repetition</em>.</p><p>But didn’t I say earlier that frequency wasn’t enough? And how does the brain know which actions are the ones to chain together to form habits anyway?</p><p>To answer the first one, I hope I’ve made clear that, while frequency or repetition isn’t the whole story, it’s an important piece. There are other important factors like a stable context which also seem to important to habit formation.</p><p>As for the second one, I’m actually not quite sure. All I know is that in procedural memory (the part of memory responsible for our actions) something called Hebbian learning happens. And Hebbian learning is a mechanism for neurons to link together after they fire in sequence *9.</p><p>So this is a rough idea of how linked actions or thoughts could form habits in the brain using the direct cuing model. It’s definitely on shakier ground than motivated cuing.</p><p>However, I think that direct cuing still seems a little more plausible because it’s able to (sort of) model a greater range of habit formation, while motivated cuing is stuck to a stricter type of habit.</p><p>(Ultimately, I just want to stress that I am not an expert in neuroscience. Please take both explanations as my humble attempt at a plain English translation. In addition to simplifications I made to aid in explanation, I’m sure I also made a few straight-up errors along the way.)</p><p style=""text-align:center;"">++++</p><h2><strong>Habit Properties:</strong></h2><p>Apart from the Standard Habit Model, there’s some additional detail that I think is worth a deeper look. Habits have several interesting properties that set them apart from other behaviors. We’ll be going over how habits are insensitive to reward changes, independent of intentions, and automatic defaults.</p><h3><strong>Insensitivity to Reward Changes:</strong></h3><p>One property of habits is that they are largely insensitive to reward changes, meaning the habit persists even when the rewards are altered or removed *10.</p><p>As evidence, there was one study where we trained people to press a button for a food reward. Yet, even when the reward was removed, we saw that they continued to respond by pressing the button *11.</p><p>This gives some insight into why using only rewards and incentives usually isn’t enough to change your habits. Once you’ve internalized the habit loop, changes to the outcome don’t have much effect on altering your behavior.</p><p>Hold on, though. Are all incentives really worthless? Surely people are more likely to act on certain behaviors if you pay them, right?</p><p>Well, we do see that financial incentives, as one example of a reward, actually are often good at encouraging short-term activities. Compared to a control group, we see that people who receive incentives are more likely to perform the target behavior.</p><p>But once the rewards stop, the behavior often does <em>not</em> habituate *12. For example, a recent study with over 1,000 subjects examined whether paying people to go to the gym would lead to increased gym habits. Alas, we found that about two months after the payment stopped, the increase in behavioral frequency went back down to roughly pre-incentive levels *13.</p><p>As a final piece of evidence, we often see that drug addicts continue to use substances, even when such behavior turns self-destructive †2. This has also been replicated in animal studies, where rats continue to respond habitually, even when the incentive is changed to a disincentive (EX: a poison) *14.</p><p>The takeaway here is that simply changing rewards isn’t enough to create or break habits.</p><p style=""text-align:center;"">++++</p><h3><strong>Independence of Intentions:</strong></h3><p>A common dichotomy for behavior is that between “goal-directed actions” and “habitual actions”.</p><p>Our intentions, i.e. our desires and thoughts, do a good job of predicting which goal-directed behaviors we’ll carry out. Goal-directed behavior refers to the category of actions where we act consciously on our preferences.</p><p>On the flip side, habitual behavior is quicker and largely unaffected by rewards, as we covered above *15. They are largely independent of your intentions, meaning that they persist even if you desire for the habit to stop.</p><p>(Such a view has many parallels to other dual-process theories like System 1 and System 2, popularized by Daniel Kahneman in his phenomenal book <em>Thinking Fast and Slow</em>.)</p><p>In the earlier example with drug use, for example, it’s quite plausible to assume that the addict would have liked to stop due to the negative effects of continued use, but still found it hard to quit.</p><p>We see that one’s intentions only affect behavior when the habit is weak. For example, people’s intentions to purchase fast food only affected their actual purchases in the absence of a strong habit *16. When habits become well-developed, intentions matter little.</p><p>On the flip side, several studies have shown that in new, unfamiliar contexts, our habits become disrupted, and our intentions once again become a stronger guide to behavior *17. We’ll explore this dynamic later in the form of a technique called Cue Disruption in to help with creating and breaking habits.</p><p>Thus, there’s a sort of inverse relationship here between one’s intentions and one’s habits.</p><p> Here&#x27;s a visual:</p></div></div></div></div><div class=""ory-row ory-cell-inner""><div class=""ory-cell ory-cell-sm-12 ory-cell-xs-12""><div class=""ory-cell-inner ory-cell-leaf""><div><img class=""ory-plugins-content-image"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*dId01iJJ9KplYqyqXFPjnQ.png""/></div></div></div></div><div class=""ory-row ory-cell-inner""><div class=""ory-cell ory-cell-sm-12 ory-cell-xs-12""><div class=""ory-cell-inner ory-cell-leaf""><div style=""border:solid 1px;border-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.12);"" class=""ory-plugins-content-spacer ory-plugins-content-spacer-read-only""><div style=""height:40px;""></div></div></div></div></div><div class=""ory-row ory-cell-inner""><div class=""ory-cell ory-cell-sm-12 ory-cell-xs-12""><div class=""ory-cell-inner ory-cell-leaf""><div><p>When habits are not well-established, intentions are a strong determinant of behavior. When habits are well-established, intentions become irrelevant *18.</p><p>But the important takeaway here is that simply “intending” to change your habits isn’t enough.</p><p style=""text-align:center;"">++++</p><h3><strong>Automatic Defaults:</strong></h3><p>The last important property of habits is their automaticity. As alluded to earlier, habits operate without much conscious control. Though they might be deliberately overridden, they are what we default to in the absence of cognitive effort.</p><p>Indeed, we see that when people become distracted, and their willpower depleted, that their habits take over, even in situations where a more reasoned decision might have been optimal *19 †3.</p><p>This also helps explain why rewards don’t do much to influence habitual behavior: Incentives often work best when they are deliberately considered, but the automatic nature of habits means that they occur without much deliberation.</p><p>Thus habits (due to their automaticity) can be thought to bypass the explicit consideration process (which is also where rewards hold the greatest weight).</p><p>The automaticity of habits is a double-edged sword:</p><p>If we’re not careful, habits can show up when we don’t want them to. These are referred to as “action slips”, and common examples are situations like driving along the same route to one’s workplace on a Sunday or calling people “Dad” (even when they aren’t your father) *18.</p><p>On the other hand, habits can often free our time and attention to focus on other things. It’s what allows our thoughts to drift even when we’re driving on the road. Sometimes, the best performance in an art or sport comes from this automaticity. In a basketball game, for example, there’s little time to think over every shot; good form and accuracy must be automatic.</p><p style=""text-align:center;"">++++</p><h2><strong>Habit Statistics:</strong></h2><p>Before we dive into some evidence-based interventions to create and break habits, I think it’s useful to quickly look at some base-rate statistics. To avoid getting any unrealistic expectations on how long it’ll take for some of this stuff to work, I think some Reference Class Forecasting is in order.</p><p>How long does it really take to form a habit?</p><p>Well, it varies. One study of around 100 people going to the gym found that about half of the people developed habits in about 40-50 days *21. An earlier study using a different methodology (and a smaller pool of people) found that the individual times varied very greatly, but the average time worked to be about 66 days *22.</p><p>(Stats for habit creation were actually fairly hard to mind, so pardon that there’s only two sources for this section. Definitely happy to update if someone finds additional info)</p><p>Thus, for a conservative estimate, you want to scale your expectations to something in the ballpark of <strong>about two months</strong>. That’s a long-ish time. Probably longer than what most people naively estimate, I suspect.</p><p>Also, in the second study, we found that only about half of the people even formed habits at all. This means the 66 day figure only came from the people who even succeeded in the first place.</p><p>This also means that if you tried to start a habit right now, your chances of sticking with a habit would only be about 50%.</p></div></div></div></div><div class=""ory-row ory-cell-inner""><div class=""ory-cell ory-cell-sm-12 ory-cell-xs-12""><div class=""ory-cell-inner ory-cell-leaf""><div><img class=""ory-plugins-content-image"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*DLYQCaDWrxPByopjMru4dg.png""/></div></div></div></div><div class=""ory-row ory-cell-inner""><div class=""ory-cell ory-cell-sm-12 ory-cell-xs-12""><div class=""ory-cell-inner ory-cell-leaf""><div style=""border:solid 1px;border-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.12);"" class=""ory-plugins-content-spacer ory-plugins-content-spacer-read-only""><div style=""height:53px;""></div></div></div></div></div><div class=""ory-row ory-cell-inner""><div class=""ory-cell ory-cell-sm-12 ory-cell-xs-12""><div class=""ory-cell-inner ory-cell-leaf""><div><p>But fear not!

I suggest this may diagnose the difficulty others have noted in getting double crux to &#x27;work&#x27;. Good philosophers seem to do much better than double cruxing using different approaches.</p><p>I aver the strengths of double crux are primarily <em>other</em> epistemic virtues, pre-requisite for double crux, which are conflated with double cruxing itself (e.g. it is good to have a collaborative rather than combative mindset when disagreeing). Conditional on having this pre-requisite set of epistemic virtues, double cruxing does not add further benefit, and is probably inferior to other means of discussion exemplified by good philosophers. I recommend we look elsewhere. </p><h2>What is a crux?</h2><p>From <a href=""https://www.lesserwrong.com/posts/exa5kmvopeRyfJgCy/double-crux-a-strategy-for-resolving-disagreement"">Sabien&#x27;s exposition</a>, a crux for some belief B is another belief C which if one changed one&#x27;s mind about C, one would change one&#x27;s mind about B. The original example was the impact of school uniforms concealing unhelpful class distinctions being a crux for whether one supports or opposes school uniforms. <br/><br/>A double crux is a particular case where two people disagree over B and have the same crux, albeit going in opposite directions. Say if Xenia believes B (because she believes C) and Yevgeny disbelieves B (because he does not believe C), then if Xenia stopped believing C, she would stop believing B (and thus agree with Yevgeny) and vice-versa.</p><h2>How common are cruxes (and double cruxes)?</h2><p>I suggest the main problem facing the &#x27;double crux technique&#x27; is that disagreements like Xenia&#x27;s and Yevgeny&#x27;s, which can be eventually traced to a single underlying consideration, are the exception rather than the rule. Across most reasonable people on most recondite topics, &#x27;cruxes&#x27; are rare, and &#x27;double cruxes&#x27; (roughly) exponentially rarer.<br/><br/>For many recondite topics I think about, my credence it in arises from the balance of a variety of considerations pointing in either direction. Thus whether or not I believe &#x27;MIRI is doing good work&#x27;, &#x27;God exists&#x27;, or &#x27;The top marginal tax rate in the UK should be higher than its current value&#x27; does not rely on a single consideration or argument, but rather its support is distributed over a plethora of issues. Although in some cases undercutting what I take as the most important consideration would push my degree of belief over or under 0.5, in other cases it would not.  <br/><br/>Thus if I meet someone else who disagrees with me on (say) whether God exists, it would be remarkable if our disagreement hinges on (for example) the evidential argument of evil, such that if I could persuade them of its soundness they would renounce their faith, and vice versa. Were I persuaded the evidential argument from evil &#x27;didn&#x27;t work&#x27;, I expect I would remain fairly sceptical of god&#x27;s existence; were I to persuade them it &#x27;does work&#x27;, I would not be surprised if they maintained other evidence nonetheless makes god&#x27;s existence likely on the total balance of evidence. And so on and so forth for other issues where reasonable people disagree. I suspect a common example would be reasonably close agreement on common information, yet beliefs diverging based on &#x27;priors&#x27;, comprised of a melange of experiences, gestalts, intuitions, and other pieces of more &#x27;private&#x27; evidence.</p><h2>Auxiliary challenges to double crux</h2><p>I believe there are other difficulties with double crux, somewhat related to the above:<br/></p><h3>Crux-asymmetry</h3><p>As implied above, even in cases where there is a crux C for person X believing B, C may not be a crux for B for person Y, but it might be something else (A?). (Or, more generally, X and Y&#x27;s set of cruxes are disjoint). A worked example: </p><p>Carl Shulman and I disagree about whether MIRI is doing good research (we have money riding on it). I expect if I lose the bet, I&#x27;d change my mind substantially about the quality of MIRI&#x27;s work (i.e. my view would be favourable rather than unfavourable). I don&#x27;t see this should be symmetrical between Shulman and I. If he lost the bet, he may still have a generally favourable view of MIRI, and a &#x27;crux&#x27; for him maybe some other evidence or collection of evidence. </p><p>X or Y may simply differ in the resilience of their credence in B, such that one or the other&#x27;s belief shifts more on being persuaded on a particular consideration. One commoner scenario (intra-EA) would be if one is trying to chase &#x27;hits&#x27;, one is probably more resilient to subsequent adverse information than the initial steers that suggested a given thing could be hit.</p><p>A related issue is when one person believes they are in receipt of a decisive consideration for or against B their interlocutor is unaware of. </p><h3>&#x27;Changing one&#x27;s mind&#x27; around p=0.5 isn&#x27;t (that) important</h3><p>In most practical cases, a difference between 1 and 0.51 or 0 and 0.49 is much more important than between 0.49 and 0.51. Thus disagreements over confidence of dis/belief can be more important, even if they may not count as &#x27;changing one&#x27;s mind&#x27;: I probably differ more with a &#x27;convinced Atheist&#x27; than an a &#x27;doubter who leans slightly towards Theism&#x27;. </p><p>Many arguments and considerations are abductive, and so lend strength to a particular belief. Thus a similar challenge applies to proposed cruxes - they may regard the <em>strength</em>, rather than <em>direction</em>, of a given consideration. One could imagine the &#x27;crux&#x27; between me and the hypothetical convinced Atheist is they think that the evidential problem of evil provides overwhelming disconfirmation for Theism, whilst I think its persuasive, perhaps decisive, but not so it drives reasonable credence in Theism down to near-zero. <br/><br/>Sabien&#x27;s exposition recognises this, and so suggests one can &#x27;double crux&#x27; over varying credences. So in this sample disagreement, the belief is &#x27;Atheism is almost certain&#x27;, and the crux is &#x27;the evidential argument from evil is overwhelming&#x27;. Yet our language for credences is fuzzy, and so what would be a crux for the difference between (say) &#x27;somewhat confident&#x27; versus &#x27;almost certain&#x27; hard to nail down in a satisfactory inter-subjective way. An alternative where a change of raw credence is &#x27;changing ones mind&#x27; entails all considerations we take to support our credence in a given a belief are cruxes.</p><h2>Intermezzo</h2><p>I suggest these difficulties may make a good diagnosis for why double cruxing has not always worked well. Anecdata seems to vary from those who have found it helpful to those who haven&#x27;t seen any benefit (but perhaps leaning towards the latter), and remarks along the lines of wanting to see a public example.</p><p>Raemon&#x27;s <a href=""https://www.lesserwrong.com/posts/T3nb24aZf7d5S2Lnm/musings-on-double-crux-and-productive-disagreement"">subsequent exegesis</a> helpfully distinguishes between the actual double crux technique. and &quot;the overall pattern of behaviour surrounding this Official Double Crux technique&quot;. They also offer a long list of considerations around the latter which may be pre-requisite for double cruxing working well (e.g. Social Skills, Actually Changing your Mind, and so on). </p><p>I wonder what value double crux really adds, if Raemon&#x27;s argument is on the right track. If double cruxing requires many (or most) of the pre-requisites suggested, all disagreements conditioned on meeting these pre-requisites will go about as well whether one uses double crux or some other intuitive means of subsequent discussion.  </p><p>A related concern of mine is a &#x27;castle-and-keep&#x27; esque defence of double crux which arises from equivocating between double crux <em>per se</em> and a host of admirable epistemic norms it may rely upon. Thus when defended double crux may transmogrify from &quot;look for some C which if you changed your mind about you&#x27;d change your mind about B too&quot; to a large set of incontrovertibly good epistemic practices &quot;It is better to be collaborative rather than combative in discussion, and be willing to change ones mind, (etc.)&quot; Yet even if double cruxing is associated with (or requires) these good practices, it is not a necessary condition for them. </p><h2>Good philosophers already disagree better than double cruxing</h2><blockquote><p><em>To find fault, easy; to do better, difficult</em></p><p style=""text-align:right;"">- Plutarch (paraphrased)</p></blockquote><p style=""text-align:left;"">Per Plutarch&#x27;s remark, any shortcomings in double crux may count for little if it is the &#x27;best we&#x27;ve got&#x27;. However, I believe I can not only offer a better approach, but this approach already exists &#x27;in the wild&#x27;. I have the fortune of knowing many extraordinary able philosophers, and not only observe their discussions but (as they also have extraordinary reserves of generosity and forbearance) participate in them as well. Their approach seems to do much better than reports of what double cruxing accomplishes. </p><p style=""text-align:left;"">What roughly happens is something like this: </p><ol><li><p>X and Y realize their credences on some belief B vary considerably.</p></li><li><p>X and Y both offer what appear (to their lights) the strongest considerations that push them to a higher/lower credence on B.</p></li><li><p>X and Y attempt to prioritize these considerations by the sensitivity of credence in B is to each of these, via some mix of resilience, degree of disagreement over these considerations, and so forth. </p></li><li><p>They then discuss these in order of priority, moving topics when the likely yield drops below the next candidate with some underlying constraint on time.</p></li></ol><p>This approach seems to avoid the &#x27;in theory&#x27; objections I raise against double crux above. It seems to avoid some of the &#x27;in practice&#x27; problems people observe:</p><ul><li><p>These discussions often occur (in fencing terms) at double time, and thus one tends not to flounder trying to find &#x27;double-cruxy&#x27; issues. Atheist may engage Theist on attempting to undermine the free will defence to the argument from evil, whilst Theist may engage Atheist on the deficiencies of moral-antirealism to prepare ground for a moral argument for the existence of god. These may be crux-y but they may be highly assymetrical. Atheist may be a compatibilist but grant libertarian free will for the sake of argument, for example: thus Atheist&#x27;s credence in God will change little even if persuaded the free will defence broadly &#x27;checks out&#x27; if one grants libertarian free will, and vice versa.</p></li><li><p>These discussions seldom get bogged down in fundamental disagreements. Although Deontologist and Utilitarian recognise their view on normative ethics is often a &#x27;double crux&#x27; for many applied ethics questions (e.g. Euthanasia), they mutually recognise their overall view on normative ethics will likely be sufficiently resilient such that either of them &#x27;changing their mind&#x27; based on a conversation is low. Instead they turn their focus to other matters which are less resilient, and thus they anticipate a greater likelihood of someone or other changing their mind.</p></li><li><p>There appears to be more realistic expectations about the result. If Utilitarian and Deontologist do discuss the merits of utilitarianism versus (say) kantianism, there&#x27;s little expectation of &#x27;resolving their disagreement&#x27; or that they will find or mutually crucial considerations. Rather they pick at a particular leading consideration on either side and see whether it may change their confidence (this is broadly reflected in the philosophical literature: papers tend to concern particular arguments or considerations, rather then offering all things considered determinations of broad recondite philosophical positions). </p></li><li><p>There appear to be better stopping rules. On the numerous occasions where I&#x27;m not aware of a particularly important consideration, it often seems a better use of everyone&#x27;s time for me to read about this in the relevant literature rather than continuing to discuss (I&#x27;d guess &#x27;reading a book&#x27;  beats &#x27;discussing with someone you disagree with&#x27; on getting more accurate beliefs about a topic per unit time surprisingly often).</p></li></ul><h2>Coda: Wherefore double crux?</h2><p>It is perhaps possible for double crux to be expanded or altered to capture the form of discussion I point to above, and perhaps one can recast all the beneficial characteristics I suggest in double crux verbiage. Yet such a program appears a fool&#x27;s errand: the core of the idea of double crux introduced at the top of the post is distinct from generally laudable epistemic norms (c.f. Intermezzo, supra), but also the practices of the elite cognisers I point towards in the section above. A concept of double crux so altered to incorporate these things is epiphenomenal - the engine which is driving the better disagreement is simply those other principles and practices double crux has now appropriated, and its chief result is to add terminological overhead, and, perhaps, inapt approximation. </p><p>I generally think the rationalist community already labours under too much bloated jargon: words and phrases which are hard for outsiders to understand, and yet do not encode particularly hard or deep concepts. I&#x27;d advise against further additions to the lexicon. &#x27;Look for key considerations&#x27; captures the key motivation for double crux better than &#x27;double crux&#x27; itself, and its meaning is clear.</p><p>The practices of exceptional philosophers set a high bar: these are people selected for, and who practice heavily, argument and disagreement. It is almost conceivable that they are better than this than even the rationalist community, notwithstanding the vast and irrefragable evidence of this group&#x27;s excellence across so many domains. Double crux could still have pedagogical value: it might be a technique which cultivates better epistemic practices, even if those who enjoy excellent epistemic practices have a better alternative. Yet this does not seem the original intent, nor does there appear much evidence of this benefit.</p><p>In the introduction to double crux, Sabien wrote that the core concept was &#x27;fairly settled&#x27;. In conclusion he writes:</p><blockquote><p>We think double crux is super sweet.  To the extent that you see flaws in it, we want to find them and repair them, and we&#x27;re currently betting that <em>repairing and refining double crux</em> is going to pay off better than try s<em>omething totally different</em>. [emphasis in original]</p></blockquote><p>I respectfully disagree. I see considerable flaws in double crux, which I don&#x27;t think have much prospect of adequate repair. Would that time and effort be spent better looking elsewhere. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p></div></div></div></div>",Thrasymachus,thrasymachus,Thrasymachus,

<p>Your data is safe, nobody took it or anything it's not like that. If you took the survey and hit the submit button, this post isn't for you.</p>
<p>For the rest of you, I'll put it plainly: I screwed up.</p>
<p>This LessWrong Survey had the lowest turnout <a href=""/lw/fk/survey_results/"">since Scott's original survey in 2009</a>. I'll admit I'm not <em>entirely</em> sure why that is, but I have a hunch and most of the footprints lead back to me. The causes I can finger seem to be <strong>the diaspora</strong>, <strong>poor software</strong>,<strong> poor advertising</strong>, and <strong>excessive length</strong>.</p>
<h2><strong>The Diaspora</strong></h2>
<p>As it stands, this years LessWrong survey got about 300 completed responses. This can be compared with <a href=""/r/lesswrong/lw/nkw/2016_lesswrong_diaspora_survey_results/"" target=""_blank"">the previous one in 2016</a> which got over <em>1600</em>. I think one critical difference between this survey and the last was its name. Last year the survey focused on figuring out where the 'Diaspora' was and what venues had gotten users now that LessWrong was sort of the walking dead. It accomplished that well I think, and part of the reason why is I titled it the LessWrong <em>Diaspora </em>Survey. That magic word got far off venues to promote it even when I hadn't asked them to. The survey was posted by Scott Alexander, Ozy Frantz, and others to their respective blogs and pretty much everyone 'involved in LessWrong' to one degree or another felt like it was meant for them to take. By contrast, this survey was focused on LessWrong's recovery and revitalization, so I dropped the word Diaspora from it and this seemed to have caused a ton of confusion. Many people I interviewed to ask why they hadn't taken the survey flat out told me that even though they were sitting in a chatroom dedicated to SSC, and they'd read the sequences, the survey wasn't about them because they had no affiliation with LessWrong. Certainly that wasn't the intent I was trying to communicate.</p>
<h2><strong>Poor Software</strong><br /></h2>
<p>When I first did the survey in 2016, taking over from Scott I faced a fairly simple problem: How do I want to host the survey? I could do it the way Scott had done it, using Google Forms as a survey engine, but this made me wary for a few reasons. One was that I didn't really have a Google account set up that I'd feel comfortable hosting the survey from, another was that I had been unimpressed with what I'd seen from the Google Forms software up to that point in terms of keeping data sanitized on entry. More importantly, it kind of bothered me that I'd be basically handing your data over to Google. This dataset includes a large number of personal questions that I'm not sure most people want Google to have definitive answers on. Moreover I figured: Why the heck do I need Google for this anyway? This is essentially just a webform backed by a datastore, i.e some of the simplest networking technology known to man in 2016. But I didn't want to write it myself, didn't <em>need</em> to write it myself this is the sort of thing there should be a dozen good self hosted solutions for.</p>
<p>There should be, but there's really only <a href=""https://www.limesurvey.org/"">LimeSurvey</a>. If I had to give this post an alternate title, it would be ""LimeSurvey: An anti endorsement"".</p>
<p>I could go on for pages about what's wrong with LimeSurvey, but it can probably be summed up as ""the software is bloated and resists customization"". It's slow, it uses slick graphics but fails to entirely deliver on functionality, its inner workings are kind of baroque, it's the sort of thing I probably should have rejected on principle and written my own. However at that time the survey was incredibly overdue, so I felt it would be better to just get out something expedient since everyone was already waiting for it anyway. And the thing is, in 2016 it went well. We got over <em>3000</em> responses including both partial and complete. So walking away from that victory and going into 2017, I didn't really think too hard about the choice to continue using it.</p>
<p>A couple of things changed between 2016 and our running the survey in 2017:</p>
<p><strong>Hosting</strong> - My hosting provider, a single individual who sets up strong networking architectures in his basement, had gotten a lot busier since 2016 and wasn't immediately available to handle any issues. The 2016 survey had a number of birthing pains, and his dedicated attention was part of the reason why we were able to make it go at all. Since he wasn't here this time, I was more on my own in fixing things.</p>
<p><strong>Myself</strong> - I had <em>also</em> gotten a lot busier since 2016. I didn't have nearly as much <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/09/30/slack/"" target=""_blank"">slack</a> as I did the last time I did it. So I was sort of relying on having done the whole process in 2016 to insulate me from opening the thing up to a bunch of problems.</p>
<p>Both of these would prove disastrous, as when I started the survey this time it was <em>slow</em>, it had a variety of bugs and issues I had only limited time to fix, and the issues just kept coming, even more than in 2016 like it had decided now when I truly didn't have the energy to spare was when things should break down. These mostly weren't show stopping bugs though, they were minor annoyances. But every minor annoyance reduced turnout, and I was slowly bleeding through the pool of potential respondents by leaving them unfixed.</p>
<p>The straw that finally broke the camels back for me was when I woke up to find that this message was being shown to most users coming to take the survey:</p>
<p><img src=""https://i.imgur.com/Odiy6f4.png"" alt=""Message Shown To Survey Respondents Telling Them Their Responses 'cannot be saved'."" width=""800"" height=""600"" /></p>
<p>""Your responses cannot be saved""? This error meant for when someone had messed up cookies was telling users a vicious lie: That the survey wasn't working right now and there was no point in them taking it.</p>
<p>Looking at this in horror and outrage, after encountering problem after problem mixed with low turnout, I finally pulled the plug.</p>
<h2><strong>Poor Advertising</strong></h2>
<p>As one email to me mentioned, the 2017 survey didn't even get promoted to the main section of the LessWrong website. This time there were no links from Scott Alexander, nor the myriad small stakeholders that made it work last time. I'm not blaming them or anything, but as a consequence many people who I interviewed to ask about why they hadn't taken the survey had not even heard it existed. Certainly this had to have been significantly responsible for reduced turnout compared to last time.</p>
<h2><strong>Excessive Length</strong></h2>
<p>Of all the things people complained about when I interviewed them on why they hadn't taken the survey, this was easily the most common response. ""It's too long.""<br /><strong></strong></p>
<p>This year I made the mistake of moving back to a single page format. The problem with a single page format is that it makes it clear to respondents just how long the survey really is. It's simply <em>too long to expect most people to complete it.</em> And before I start getting suggestions for it in the comments, the problem isn't actually that it needs to be shortened, per se. The problem is that to investigate every question we might want to know about the community, it really needs to be broken into more than one survey. Especially when there are stakeholders involved who would like to see a particular section added to satisfy some questions they have.</p>
<p>Right now I'm exploring the possibility of <a href=""http://www.yourmorals.org/"" target=""_blank"">setting up a site similar to yourmorals</a> so that the survey can be effectively broken up and hosted in a way where users can sign in and take different portions of it at their leisure. Further gamification could be added to help make it a little more fun for people. Which leads into...</p>
<h2><strong>The Survey Is Too Much Work For One Person</strong></h2>
<p>What we need isn't a guardian of the survey, it's really more like a survey committee. I would be perfectly willing (and plan to) chair such a committee, but I frankly need help. Writing the survey, hosting it without flaws, theming it so that it looks nice, writing any new code or web things so that we can host it without bugs, <em>comprehensively analyzing the thing</em>, it's a damn lot of work to do it right and so far I've kind of been relying on the generosity of my friends for it. If there are other people who really care about the survey and my ability to do it, consider this my recruiting call for you to come and help. You can mail me here on LessWrong, post in the comments, or email me at jd@fortforecast.com. If that's something you would be interested in I could really use the assistance.</p>
<h2><strong>What Now?</strong><br /></h2>
<p>Honestly? I'm not sure. The way I see it my options look something like:</p>
<p><strong>Call It A Day And Analyze What I've Got</strong> - N=300 is nothing to sneeze at, theoretically I could just call this whole thing a wash and move on to analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Try And Perform An Emergency Migration </strong>- For example, I could try and set this up again on Google Forms. Having investigated that option, there's no 'import' button on Google forms so the survey would need to be reentered manually for all hundred-and-a-half questions.</p>
<p><strong>Fix Some Of The Errors In LimeSurvey And Try Again On Different Hosting</strong> - I considered doing this too, but it seemed to me like the software was so clunky that there was simply no reasonable expectation this wouldn't happen again. LimeSurvey also has poor separation between being able to edit the survey and <em>view the survey results</em>, I couldn't delegate the work to someone else because that could theoretically violate users privacy.</p>
<p>These seem to me like the only things that are possible for this survey cycle, at any rate an extension of time would be required for another round. In the long run I would like to organize a project to write a new software from scratch that fixes these issues and gives us a site multiple stakeholders can submit surveys to which might be too niche to include in the current LessWrong Survey format.</p>
<p>I'm welcome to other suggestions in the comments, consider this my SOS.</p>

Please only throw suggestions here if you have a reasonable understanding of Bayes&#x27; rule, *and* grok the problem I&#x27;m pointing at.</p><p>First, the problem I&#x27;m ACTUALLY trying to solve: If I believe I solved a practical problem to the satisfaction of its stakeholders, what is the probability that my belief is correct?</p><p>Now, the problem *around* the problem I&#x27;m actually trying to solve:</p><p>I can look at a solution I implemented to a practical problem, and judge whether I&#x27;m satisfied with it or not. BUT, often there are more actual stakeholders than just me. These stakeholders ALSO have opinions about whether I implemented the solution to their satisfaction.</p><p>Note I said &quot;have opinions about&quot;, *not* &quot;have information about&quot;. This is an important distinction, as you&#x27;re about to see.</p><p>So. Let&#x27;s say I have a confidence probability of p=0.65 that I performed a particular task well.</p><p>There are five other identified stakeholders, and their averaged confidence is something like p=0.4 that I performed that task well.</p><p>I have some weighting process that says whose opinion I take more seriously, so I adjust my confidence down to p=0.55.</p><p>I notice that this adjusts their averaged confidence downward, to something like p=0.35.</p><p>I perform more tasks, and poll more. I notice that people&#x27;s opinion of my performance tracks mine, but is invariably adjusted downward by about 33%. So I adjust my opinion of my performance downward by about 30%.</p><p>Magically, this causes their opinion of my performance to drop by about 25%.</p><p>After taking enough samples, I start deliberately adjusting my opinion of my performance *upwards* massively. If I feel a 0.7 probability that I satisfied the requirement, I convince myself that it&#x27;s actually an 0.9 probability. Consistently, other people start treating my performance as if it were higher quality - but they ALSO treat me as if I&#x27;m an arrogant ass who can&#x27;t judge the quality of my performance. Because they&#x27;re still setting their own opinions to something like 33% below mine, but when they translate the probability into something like &#x27;confidence weight&#x27; (which I assume is some kind of log-odds transform), being 33% less confident than me FEELS like a much bigger gap when I&#x27;m 90% sure and they&#x27;re 60% sure, than when I&#x27;m 65% sure and they&#x27;re 45% sure.</p><p>I&#x27;m convinced that there&#x27;s SOME signal in the noise of their confidence in my ability, but so much of it seems coupled to my OWN confidence in my ability, that I can&#x27;t tell.</p><p>So, how do I calibrate?<br/><br/>I have three points of frustration here, that I wish to caution responders about:<br/><br/>1. A meta-level problem I have with these situations, is that I often notice that people are spending more time trying to convince me that they&#x27;re using something like Bayes&#x27; rule, than they are actually generating observable evidence that they&#x27;re using something like Bayes&#x27; rule. So assume that at least one of us is miscalibrated about being miscalibrated, *AND* that we&#x27;re collectively miscalibrated about being miscalibrated about being miscalibrated.<br/><br/>2. Many people, when I talk about this, tell me &quot;oh, well *I* don&#x27;t take your confidence and adjust downward, so please exclude me from the list of people who do.&quot; Most of the people who tell me this, are in fact doing so. This means that even if you AREN&#x27;T doing so, saying those words is not evidence that you aren&#x27;t doing so, and in fact is weak evidence that you are. If you decide to emit those words anyways, I will assume you didn&#x27;t actually grok the Sequences or the correct bits of HPMOR, and I will discount your advice accordingly.<br/><br/>3.  Most people, when they try to describe the process they think they use to arrive at a confidence level that I solved a problem, craft a narrative story about why some evidence is relevant and other evidence isn&#x27;t. These narratives suspiciously change from situation to situation, such that different bits of evidence are relevant in one case and not in another, in a way that *looks* highly motivated to arrive at numbers that *appear* to actually just be tracking my own confidence level. Most people react with offense or frustration rather than curiosity when I ask them what they&#x27;re using to determine which evidence is relevant and which isn&#x27;t. Don&#x27;t be that guy.</p></div></div></div></div>",ialdabaoth,ialdabaoth,ialdabaoth,

They may wash their hair daily, once a week, or not at all. They may wash their bodies thoroughly, only clean the parts that look dirty, only clean certain parts (such as the armpits or genitals), or just stand under the water. They may use a loofah, a sponge, or nothing. They may bring in a comb to comb out the conditioner. They may sing. They may zone out. They may jerk off. They may bathe instead, and bathing may involve reading a book or bath bombs or lighting candles and drinking a nice bottle of wine or bubble bath or none of those things at all. The one thing that is consistent is that everyone thinks the way they shower is the way normal people shower.</p><p>The reason for all this diversity, of course, is that after early childhood we don&#x27;t shower together (except in locker rooms or as a form of sexual foreplay, both of which are likely to be unusual) and we rarely discuss exactly how we shower. We can get a certain amount of information about typical showers (such as length) from living with people, but again most people don&#x27;t live with that many people, and the people they live with may be unusual. The rule follows: for things that are private and rarely discussed, there may be a good deal of unacknowledged diversity.</p><p>Sex is interesting because, while private, it is often discussed. People (including myself) have a certain tendency to deduce what sex is like for everyone from what sex is like for ourselves. As an example, consider pubic hair. There are innumerable thinkpieces about the pressure experienced by women to shave their pubic hair and the disgust of their male sexual partners if they are unshaven.</p><p>This has never been my experience. I have literally never had a man offer any opinion on my pubic hair whatsoever. If he did I would consider him to be an utter boor, I would never hook up with him again, and I would complain to my friends and expect all my friends to be sympathetic. My local norm is that, while of course one may have preferences about pubic hair grooming or genital size or coloring or some other traits, it is incredibly rude to voice any opinion about others&#x27; genitals other than &quot;happy to be here!&quot; Maybe if you&#x27;re in a long-term committed relationship with someone you could bring up the topic politely, while remaining aware that their pubic hair grooming is their own business and you have no right to demand anything.</p><p>In the rare occasions where I&#x27;ve had the opportunity to find out men&#x27;s opinions on pubic hair, they have often been enthusiastic. For instance, when I cammed, my clients universally preferred a hairy pussy. (As my ex-girlfriend used to joke, &quot;the first day you cam you shave your pussy, six months in you start googling &#x27;pubic hair thicker darker techniques.&#x27;&quot;) And of the men I know who have mentioned their opinions on pubic hair, most have been something along the lines of &quot;<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-GQ63NStxk"">I say grow that shit like a jungle, give &#x27;em something strong to hold onto, let it fly in the open wind</a>&quot; (although they do not generally agree that if it get too bushy you can trim).</p><p>Do I think the thinkpiece writers are wrong? Probably not! I suspect they&#x27;re accurately reporting what the dating pool is like for them and their friends, but for some reason it&#x27;s different. Perhaps men who hire camgirls are older and have more old-fashioned preferences, or hairy pussies are undersupplied in mainstream porn causing their aficionados to seek out handmade artisanal porn, or a hairy pussy makes the camgirl look normal and attainable and clients find this attractive. Many of my friends are queer; perhaps queers are different from heterosexuals, and this rubs off even on the straight men around them. Maybe I spend lots of time in sex-positive communities, and we&#x27;ve successfully created a norm of body positivity, which means that people feel it is rude to make negative comments on other people&#x27;s bodies. Maybe it&#x27;s something I haven&#x27;t thought of.</p><p>Another example: a few months back, I was reading an argument about polyamory in which a monogamous man said that he knew that poly men didn&#x27;t really have girlfriends, because their wives would shut down this whole poly thing the second they started spending $10,000 a year on their new girlfriend, as of course everyone does. My first reaction was to make fun of it: who spends $10,000 a year on a girlfriend? What the fuck are you buying her, a solid gold pony shoed with diamonds? I want someone to spend ten thousand dollars a year on me, that sounds great.</p><p>(Topher: &quot;I think that probably involves a lot of nice dinners at fancy restaurants with expensive bottles of wine, and you have a phobia of alcohol.&quot; Me: &quot;they can buy me tea instead! you know how much really good pu&#x27;erh I could get for $800 a month?&quot;)</p><p>To be clear: while there might be some extraordinarily wealthy poly person who spends $10,000 a year on their girlfriends, in my experience of poly communities this is not true.  Typical dates include &quot;taking a long walk&quot;, &quot;getting a cup of coffee&quot;, &quot;watching a TV show on Netflix&quot;, &quot;being on Tumblr in the same room and showing each other cute cat gifs&quot;, and &quot;taking care of a small child together&quot;. (Maybe that last one is just me.) If you get dinner, you can generally expect to split the bill, unless one person happens to be particularly poor or prone to forgetting their wallet, and the date is probably going to be at a $5 burrito place. In my experience, polyamory only starts getting pricey if you have to buy plane tickets to visit out-of-town partners or start letting all your partners stay in your house rent-free in the Bay Area.</p><p>But when I make fun of $10,000/year guy, I&#x27;m making the same error. I&#x27;ve generally only dated broke students, broke artists, and programmers, who while wealthy have a distinct tendency to drive old cars and refuse to wear any shirts not given to them for free. And even if I did go on a first date with someone who wanted to spend $10,000/year on me, I would wear sweatpants to the nice restaurant, not be able to find anything lacto vegetarian on the menu without custom-ordering some very depressing spaghetti with marinara sauce, and flinch away from the expensive wine as if it were a spider. At that point the question is just who rejects whom first.</p><p>Instead of assuming that the people I date are a random selection from the pool of All People Who Date Ever, I should assume that they&#x27;re a biased sample: they&#x27;re people I&#x27;m attracted to, who are attracted to me, and whom I even get a chance to meet and interact with at all. This is a pretty biased subset of humanity: no prizes for guessing why I don&#x27;t typically date monolingual Swahili speakers.</p><p>And I&#x27;m unlikely to notice the other subsets of humanity even exist. While I can observe the existence of truck drivers, hockey fans, and other people far different from me, sex and romance are private, and I only get indirect evidence and self-report of what other people&#x27;s sexual or romantic lives are like. It&#x27;s particularly easy to assume that what it&#x27;s like for me is what it&#x27;s like for everyone-- just like it&#x27;s easy for me to assume that everyone else zones out in the shower.</p><p>Therefore, I think it&#x27;s a good practice to, when people make claims about dating or sex that seem ludicrous or bizarre to you, have as your first hypothesis that they are accurately describing some dating pool you are not in.</p></div></div></div></div>",ozymandias,ozymandias,ozymandias,

You have to keep at it knowing what you are doing might be a dead end or a distraction.</p><h3>Difficulty of knowing you have made progress</h3><p>Even if you identify a sub-problem to solve sometimes it is hard to know if solving that problem we really help.</p><h3> Self-trust </h3><p>Because of these two things, and all the content on biases that we read, you have to constantly doubt what you think you know and what you should be doing. Because of Goodhearts you have to worry about lost purposes when you actually try to do something uncertain.</p><h3>Trusting Others</h3><p>If you can&#x27;t trust yourself, you can&#x27;t trust other people. Even if you trust their motivation to save the world you cannot trust their knowledge and that they are not protecting the epistemology. And they find it hard to trust you. Working with people can raise the trust level of their knowledge, but not of their sub-goals.</p><h3>Trusting Organisations</h3><p>A whole bunch of people, you don&#x27;t know very well, acting together, trying to maintain a public persona so the organisation can persist over time. That is even harder to trust.</p><p></p><p>In short it is hard to find contented feeling of a job well done or relax in the knowledge that competent people are on the job. This is different from problems that have short time frames.</p></div></div></div></div>",,,,

<p><a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/09/30/slack/"">Slack</a> is life. It is under attack. We must fight for it.</p>

<p>We need time for ourselves. Time that is truly our own.</p>
<p>Without setting aside such time, that won&#8217;t happen. Even when you take time, you&#8217;ll be continuously <em>choosing </em>to take time, and&#8230; well, whoops.</p>
<p>Modern life made the problem worse, but the problem is ancient. The ancients had an answer.</p>
<p>We need rules. We need ritual.</p>
<p>We need the Sabbath.</p>
<p><strong>Cabin in the Woods</strong></p>
<p>The parallels of my <a href=""http://benjaminrosshoffman.com/sabbath-hard-and-go-home"">and Ben Hoffman&#8217;s</a> Sabbath realizations are striking.</p>
<p>A few months ago, like Ben, I needed a break. My job puts me under constant pressure. My weekends weren&#8217;t refreshing me. Like Ben, I experimented with camping. Like Ben, I had no spare battery, and left my phone off.  I read <a href=""https://smile.amazon.com/Great-Transformation-Political-Economic-Origins/dp/080705643X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1506641053&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+great+transformation"">The Great Transformation</a>. I had meant to do that for weeks. I loved the world <em>leaving me alone. </em>Like Ben, I could relax, slow down, think.</p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t worried about things I <em>could </em>be doing &#8211; I couldn&#8217;t do them.</p>
<p>Could I get this without the trip? Friends had started hosting Friday night dinners. What about the whole thing? What if we brought back the Sabbath?</p>
<p>Tradition makes rules easier to justify and explain, to others and yourself. These rules were time tested. I could take them and make them my own.</p>
<p>I thought about the components. Which made sense? What rules would let me cut the enemy, and relax?</p>
<p><strong>Return of the Ritual</strong></p>
<p>Rituals need clear beginnings and endings.</p>
<p>Sabbath begins with candles. One lights two candles, and recites a blessing.</p>
<p>For the evening meal, one says additional words and blessings, drinks wine, eats bread from one of two whole loafs and sits down to a proper meal with friends and family.</p>
<p>The candles are a signpost and deadline. Your week is complete and your work is done. There will be guests, so the apartment is ready. The ritual objects, and your needs for tomorrow, are secured. The meal is prepared. Time to feast and relax!</p>
<p><a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/09/30/slack/"">Slack</a> is thus preserved in five ways.</p>
<p>This creates a time and place to see friends and family. Most want more social events, but coordination is hard and events are work. Now there&#8217;s always Friday night.</p>
<p>They increase the value of improving your home. Every week you notice the little things that enrich meal, visit and home. They&#8217;re Worth It, but easy to forget. Enhancing the little things enhances your life.</p>
<p>They prevent accumulation of personal-and-home-related work debt. A chaotic house is not restful. Postponed chores weigh on you<em>. </em>The deadline forces handling them in advance. Payoff is immediate.</p>
<p>By moving work <em>before </em>the deadline you are forced to <em>make time</em> <em>during the week. </em>You don&#8217;t eat into Slack. If you can&#8217;t find the time, this alerts you. Emergency!</p>
<p>They create visible failure as you approach hard bounds. When emergency arises, you sacrifice from the ritual. This signals emergency <em>before</em> life falls apart. You still have reserves. The ritual <em>is </em>Slack.</p>
<p>Sabbath ends with another candle. This prevents doing work until you <em>go through non-trivial motions</em>. You must do it on purpose.</p>
<p><strong>Four Freedoms</strong></p>
<p>We need restrictions that free us from the world. We need a new <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Freedoms"">four freedoms</a>.</p>
<p>We need <em>freedom from work. </em>Decide what counts as work to you. Don&#8217;t do that. Anything done for money is automatically work. During the week, time is money. Today, do what <em>you </em>value.</p>
<p>We need <em>freedom from interruption. </em>Space to think. Cut off the outside world. Especially cut off anything continuously updating and all periodic rewards. There lie Skinner boxes. Much of the world is <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/09/23/out-to-get-you/"">out to get you</a>. Today it can wait. Friendly visitors are welcome, but ideally arranged in advance.</p>
<p>We need <em>freedom from choice. </em>Full freedom from choice requires a step <em>beyond </em>the traditional rules. In my version, even among permitted activities, only those explicitly selected in advance are available &#8211; particular books, radio stations and so forth &#8211; plus things you feel intrinsic motivation to do. No lists. No browsing.</p>
<p>We need <em>freedom from stress</em>. Stressful conversations are <em>not allowed</em>. Doing work is <em>not allowed. </em>Making decisions is <em>not allowed.</em> Outside information is <em>not allowed</em>. If something was <em>still </em>going to stress you out and it was fixable, <em>fix it before the Sabbath. </em>Things can&#8217;t change on their own, and you can&#8217;t make them change. Why stress?</p>
<p><strong>Sabbath Easy, Sabbath Easy, Sabbath Hard</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tension exists between <em>that which is most restful right now,</em> and <em>that which would be a stable set of rules. </em>There are <em>two </em><a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/08/26/play-in-easy-mode/"">Easy Modes</a>, representing each extreme.</p>
<p>One extreme is Orthodox Sabbath. This uses <em>a strict, fixed set of rules. </em>Pure deontology. You can&#8217;t <em>carry objects</em> without special preparations. Many objects you can&#8217;t even<em> touch. </em>This interferes a lot with relaxation, and <em>forces realignment of life to prevent that. </em>That can be good. There are even rules about violating the spirit of the rules &#8211; if you violate the spirit without breaking <em>even those rules, </em>that&#8217;s almost encouraged. Restrictions allow maximization.</p>
<p>Another extreme is Reform Sabbath. This asks, <em>what would be most restful today? </em>This is utilitarian and uses <a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Causal_Decision_Theory"">causal decision theory</a>. Sabbath is for rest, so if driving a car or making a call would be more restful, do that. You <em>could </em>break the rules. This destroys freedom from choice. Who respects such boundaries? You won&#8217;t have urgency <em>before </em>the Sabbath. You can handle things later. Wouldn&#8217;t that be <em>more restful? </em></p>
<p>The <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/08/26/play-in-hard-mode/"">Hard Mode</a> approach asks, <em>what sustainable rule set best preserves long run Slack?</em> Taking stock and encouraging Slack-preserving outside the Sabbath are explicit goals. It uses <a href=""https://arbital.com/p/logical_dt/?l=5kv"">logical decision theory</a>. It creates personalized rules <em>you </em>can follow that work <em>for you, </em>but understands each divergence you select is expensive.</p>
<p>It asks <em>what would be in the spirit of the rules, </em>and modifying the rules to reflect that spirit. It views breaking current rules <em>during the Sabbath </em>with extreme skepticism, to reinforce following the rules. It modifies rules on Sunday.</p>
<p>In choice-related ways my current system is more restrictive<em> </em>than the Orthodox version. Mostly it is less restrictive, but becoming more restrictive over time. I currently allow Level 4 but everything there is on the chopping block. On Friday night I restrict to Level 2.</p>
<p><strong>Hierarchy of the Shabbistic</strong></p>
<p>There exists a hierarchy of shabbisticness. At one end are activities aligned with the goals of relaxing, recharging and unplugging. Sleep certainly qualifies. At the other are activities perfectly in conflict with those goals. Work done for money.</p>
<p>The hierarchy&#8217;s details are different for different people. If you see something as work, it drains you. Move it down towards the unshabbistic. If you see something as invigorating, and have the spontaneous urge to do it <em>for intrinsic reasons, </em>move it up towards the shabbistic.</p>
<p>Then draw a hard line. Deciding whether to allow something is an impactful choice (itself banned) and a slippery slope. The golden rule of Sabbath is not breaking the  rules. When in doubt, don&#8217;t do the thing, then refine your rule on Sunday.</p>
<p>I encourage stricter rules for Friday night than Saturday. This enriches without being stifling.</p>
<p>This is my current hierarchy. Levels 1-2 I consider purely good, Levels 3 good, Level 4  questionable. Level 5 is bad, Level 6 very bad. <em>Level 7 is banned all week.</em></p>
<ol>
<li>Pure rest. Sleep. Rest. Walking. Intellectual discussion. Friendly discussion. Reading physical books and other physical objects. Meditation. Museums. Taking a bath.</li>
<li>Active rest. Sex. Flirting. Running. Swimming. Playing sports. Arguments for low stakes. Board and card games with no stakes. Puzzles. Building models. Taking a shower. Eating. Watching sports in person. Light switches.</li>
<li>Consumptive rest. Riding elevators. Radio with one station. Listening to music. Food preparation without lighting a fire. Window shopping. Kindle and other e-books.</li>
<li>Potentially toxic actions. Writing for yourself. Taking notes. Practicing and training personal skills that are not work or work related. Working out. Computer games. Pre-selected television. Phone calls and texts for physical coordination purposes. Riding in cars and trains (without payment).</li>
<li>Violations of compactness. Phone calls and texts not for same-day logistical coordination. All other use of smartphones. Making impactful decisions. Planning. Flipping stations on television or radio. Browsing the internet. Browsing a giant music collection. All long lists, especially lists of choices. Checking anything that continuously updates. Lighting a fire. Stressful topics of conversation.</li>
<li>Work and outside demands. Exchange of money. Doing business. Anything that earns money or creates commercial value. Negotiations. All continuous updates. Email.</li>
<li>Considered harmful. All timed and daily rewards. Micro-transactions. Social media.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The Rules Simplified</strong></p>
<p>Start here. Adjust as needed.</p>
<p>Light candles before sundown Friday to begin.</p>
<p>No outside inputs except in person.</p>
<p>No choices impacting post-Sabbath.</p>
<p>Light and extinguish no fires. Do no work or business. Spend no money.</p>
<p>Only preselected and spontaneously motivated actions are allowed. No browsing. No lists.</p>
<p>Light another candle after sundown Saturday to end.</p>
<p><strong>State of Emergency</strong></p>
<p>I brought back Sabbath for Slack and relaxation. Ben brought it back as an alarm system, for when life was out of control. Sabbath shows when you are not okay, and provides method and incentive to get back to okay.</p>
<p>This Saturday I did full Orthodox Sabbath (minus prayer), and also fasted, as an experiment. I won&#8217;t do this every week or even month, but it had important alarm value.</p>
<p>Ben&#8217;s post is excellent. <a href=""http://benjaminrosshoffman.com/sabbath-hard-and-go-home"">Read the whole thing.</a> I&#8217;ll finish with two key passages from it.</p>
<p>Key motivation:</p>
<blockquote><p>You would not want to do this sort of thing all the time. But it might make sense to do periodically &#8211; perhaps once a week &#8211; as a stopgap measure to combat attention drift. If powerful and pervasive cultural forces are <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/04/22/against-facebook-comparison-to-alternatives-and-call-to-action/""><span class=""s2"">out to get you</span></a>, you ought to check in from time to time with yourself, and other people with whom you have local, high-quality relationships, to give yourself a chance to notice whether you have <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/09/23/out-to-get-you/""><span class=""s2"">gotten got</span></a> for too much.</p></blockquote>
<p>His conclusion is important and worth quoting in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">One more useful attribute of the Jewish Sabbath is the extent to which its rigid rules generate friction in emergency situations. If your community center is not within walking distance, if there is not enough slack in your schedule to prep things a day in advance, or you are too poor to go a day without work, or too locally isolated to last a day without broadcast entertainment, then <i>things are not okay</i>.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">In our commercialized society, there will be many opportunities to purchase palliatives, and these palliatives are often worth purchasing. If living close to your place of employment would be ruinously expensive, you drive or take public transit. If you don’t have time to feed yourself, you can buy some fast food. If you’re not up for talking with a friend in person, or don’t have the time, there’s Facebook. But this is palliative care for a chronic problem.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">In Jewish law, it is permissible to break the Sabbath in an emergency situation, when lives are at stake. If something like the Orthodox Sabbath seems impossibly hard, or if you try to keep it but end up breaking it every week &#8211; as my Reform Jewish family did &#8211; then you should consider that perhaps, despite the propaganda of the palliatives, <i>you are in a permanent state of emergency</i>. This is not okay. You are not doing okay.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">So, how are you?</span></p>
</blockquote>

I’m going to put them here in disorganized form for the curious. These claims are believed, but I may not have good explicit evidence to defend them with. I’m fine with that.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>I. Slack Against Slack</strong></p><p>One might challenge Sabbath with,&nbsp;“Isn’t it weird protecting Slack by taking Slack away? Aren’t you avoiding hard bounds on behavior by&nbsp;<i>imposing hard bounds on behavior?</i>“<i>&nbsp;</i></p><p>Yes, I am doing that. Yes it is weird. Also suspicious.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You’re taking some types of Slack away by forbidding and requiring activities, to guard and create the Slack that matters.</p><p>This can backfire. When I was a kid the Sabbath was rules preventing fun. Saturday was just Sunday except nothing worked and you sat in a room for three hours while people mumbled in Hebrew. That’s not a solution, that’s making the problem worse. Sunday was free from outside pressures and insanely great! Why not do that?</p><p>So no, not&nbsp;<i>everyone&nbsp;</i>needs a Sabbath for Slack or relaxation. It is one solution among many to the problems of outside pressures, to too many choices, to having less than no time and not enough money. Not everyone even has those problems. If you have so much time and so little to do, rather than striking that and reversing it, a regular Sabbath is not right for you. This is your periodic reminder to <a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/03/24/should-you-reverse-any-advice-you-hear/"">reverse all advice you hear</a>.</p><p>You still&nbsp;need to take stock sometimes. If there’s nothing worth doing, forcing the issue by taking away your social media and match three games might help solve your rut. Is that worth one day in seven? Probably not, but one in forty-nine?</p><p><strong>II. Sabbath Dinner</strong></p><p>I kept and went into a lot of detail on the Sabbath dinner. The dinner speaks to me and my needs a lot. It might not speak to yours, but I’m a big fan, and want to say more about that. Here are some non-obvious benefits, in addition to the ones I already mentioned – a place and time that enables social gatherings and visits and/or family/relationship time, a strong demarcation and strongly positive experience for the transition to your day of rest, and providing urgency and incentive to take care of business around the house and make it a place worth living in.</p><p>Sabbath dinner gives incentive and opportunity to learn to cook. Cooking skill is an investment that pays off. The few things I know how to cook well provide great benefit to me, even though my wife Laura is a <i>much&nbsp;</i>better cook.&nbsp;If you can’t cook, you’ll be forced to do commerce constantly to eat reasonably. Having to go into that mode in order to get your daily sustenance is actually pretty bad. It’s great to know that if need be, you can take care of things yourself, if you’re short on cash or in an unfamiliar place without good options. There’s also something very satisfying about both cooking and knowing how to cook. With time, you learn to make things exactly the way&nbsp;<i>you&nbsp;</i>like, and things are pretty great. They’re even better than that for those around you.&nbsp;Highly recommended. Basic life skills and self-sufficiency are a thing, they are key to Slack. Muddling through without them is a trap.</p><p>This then contrasts with the lack of cooking during Sabbath. I suspect that it should go a step further and you should perhaps&nbsp;<i>fast&nbsp;</i>on the Sabbath, with the feast at the start setting you up well for either. Fasting takes away the distraction of thinking about food, and fasting is a key Slack skill – if you&nbsp;<i>need&nbsp;</i>to eat all the time, that can lead to some bad trade-offs. If I don’t have good options I know I can always fast, because I have the practice. Even if cooking is allowed, consumption shouldn’t be a focus during the Sabbath day, it’s out of place.</p><p>There’s also making sure you treat yourself to one true feast each week, one indulgence for yourself. You need it, you deserve it, and you need to confirm that you have the Slack for it. You want something to have gratitude for – prayer and blessings are phrased like you’re trying to placate or negotiate or petition a higher power, but really it’s a trick to get you to write gratitude letters. Thus, you want the meal to be&nbsp;<i>visibly abundant and bountiful.&nbsp;</i>This is why it’s important to me to have two full loaves of bread for the main blessing. You only truly needed one, but you make sure to have two anyway.</p><p>The wine is similar. I don’t drink, but I totally understand the idea of “I need a drink”<i>&nbsp;</i>and the idea of a time when one can drink, and think those are important even though I don’t get enjoyment out of alcohol and thus save my calories for elsewhere outside of ritual quantities. It’s weird that I can be in the state of&nbsp;“I need a drink” and still not want one; I appreciate the benefits other people get and want those benefits, but I know I wouldn’t get them. Plus, alcohol is kind of a terrible drug and cause of all life’s problems, so sitting non-symbolic quantities of this one out seems wise.</p><p>This is something I have to sacrifice to get. Work provides me with free and quite good lunch even if it can’t hold a candle to my wife’s cooking, but I don’t have the caloric budget to eat three meals in a day, so I have to both give up on a free lunch and I have to get through the day hungry. When I finally get home, I’m that much more appreciative, and I value my ritual, feast and rest that much more.</p><p>I think others can and should substitute other things (although I would still light the candles, and say some ritual words of your choosing), but that the idea of starting the Sabbath with a special indulgence that speaks to you is very important. Save something special to you for that slot in the week. Make sure it stands out.</p><p><strong>III. Travel</strong></p><p>An argument can be made that, while freedom to go anywhere would be a violation of freedom from choice and also feel a lot like work, being able to go places in accordance with plans seems valuable and reasonable, especially if you can take a train or bus with a monthly pass, or otherwise avoid spending money and avoid driving. I think it’s a reasonable stance to allow this for (and only for) plans made together with other people, but would still be cautious about that.</p><p>Being physically next to the people you care about, and the people you want to spend time with, is an important thing we have lost. Proximity, including being able to walk to each other and knock on the door, is important. Knowing your neighbors, or at least some of them, is important. I think it’s great that a bunch of people in The Bay are moving to the same street, even if I think the particular street isn’t in the best location. I hope they knock on each other’s doors all the time unannounced, and I hope lots of other people drop by all the time and let spontaneous things happen. That would be great.</p><p>I used to live in the same building as my good friend Alyssa, and that was pretty great. I would love to live that close to my friends again, and hope to coordinate such a thing here in New York at some point. Perhaps in a year or so. Giving people a strong extra incentive to do this, given they should be doing it anyway, seems very good. Not having this is an emergency situation and needs to be treated like one.</p><p>Right now, we’re kind of cheating, because&nbsp;<i>we&nbsp;</i>won’t travel but&nbsp;<i>our friends&nbsp;</i>mostly will, so they come to us. Those others who actually do keep the Sabbath, are exactly those we&nbsp;<i>can’t&nbsp;</i>see on Saturday. So that’s weird, and I don’t love it, but I think it’s a price worth paying.</p><p><strong>IV. Screens</strong></p><p>There is something obviously bad about screens, even when we can’t quite put our finger on exactly what it is. We can say things like ‘takes our focus away from where we are and what is happening’ but that doesn’t seem like it captures the true objection. Their demand for attention, the constant impulse to look at them even when you don’t want to, is definitely also a big factor. We’ve all heard the arguments. Certainly there should be a prejudice that things done with screens are more unshabbistic than things done without them, even when the thing being done is the same.</p><p>Despite that, screens have great utility and power, so we need to think hard about exactly what we’re doing and what effect it has. If you’re reading a Kindle, isn’t that basically reading a book? It sort of is, but it also sort of isn’t. It feels like you’re invoking something you shouldn’t be, it strains the eyes, it doesn’t give you physical control of what you’re doing in the same way, it can hold lots of books and thus implies choice you want to have freedom from. Your environment no longer is what it appears to be. Certainly the Kindle book is&nbsp;<i>much less bad&nbsp;</i>than most uses of screens, but it still feels like it should be strongly discouraged. Does this then mean a bunch of physical books that you don’t otherwise need? It might. Is that good or bad? I’m not sure, but I think it is good. By going digital perhaps we are trading for convenience at the expense of building a library (again, creating a home) and a connection to what we are reading. Having books around means books get read and thought about in a way a Kindle does not. The main advantage of a Kindle is that it allows the easy&nbsp;<i>taking and sharing of notes&nbsp;</i>but that is the least Shabbistic thing one can do with a book!</p><p>Computers and smart phones are highly dangerous, offering tons of choices and distractions and opportunities for the outside world to reach you. Phones are the worst, threatening each free moment. We’ve been trained to reach for our phones every spare moment, constantly comparing what we’re doing to what little distraction we could be looking at. They also let anyone reach you, and provide a world of resources and connection if you wanted it. I think it’s important to physically leave your phone behind on the Sabbath if there’s no pending emergency.</p><p>I have used computer for two purposes on the Sabbath, to write and to play video games. Writing is a special case. Playing video games can be relaxing, but it can also be a palliative and Skinner box you no longer enjoy that prevents you from taking stock. I realized that the game I’d been playing wasn’t something I was still enjoying that much; it had turned into work and stress, still with satisfaction and strategy but mostly I wanted to see how it ends and achieve victory – the joy of the journey was mostly dead. That doesn’t mean I don’t still want to finish, but it&nbsp;<i>does&nbsp;</i>mean it’s not Shabbistic.</p><p><strong>V. Notifications</strong></p><p>Sabbath proper begins with lighting candles. The ritual truly begins for me earlier than that, when I finish work: I turn email notifications off on my phone.</p><p>Notifications are tricky when you don’t want to be bothered, but still know you have the urge to check for new things. If you have notifications on, you’ll be interrupted every time you get notified, and that’s terrible. If you turn them off, the risk is that you’ll still worry there’s something waiting for you, and you’ll check&nbsp;<i>anyway,&nbsp;</i>even if there isn’t anything to see, and that’s even worse. So you only want to turn notifications off if you’ll actually be able to ignore the situation. The act of turning notifications off is my way of telling myself that it is time to start winding things down. I still have some preparations to do and several miles to travel, but as of now the world can wait.</p><p>Turning notifications back on, and checking my email, always feels like a mistake. I want to postpone it, knowing that once I look I’ll be drawn back in, and I keep meaning to move that to Sunday morning but keep not doing it. That is a sign of how bad things have gotten. How am I, indeed?</p><p><strong>VI. Writing</strong></p><p>Writing is important to me. Writing is how I figure things out for myself, and it’s value that I hope I am creating for others, and it’s part of the grand project that isn’t my career and isn’t my family, and that I’m hoping will actually matter. I have a lot of ideas running around in my head all the time, and working them out has strong intrinsic motivation. It is refreshing to me to work on that, and would greatly bother me not to. So for now, I do write on the Sabbath, even though it does seem suspiciously like work.</p><p>One result of this is that I am&nbsp;<i>very&nbsp;</i>careful to make sure that I’m not being compensated in any way for writing. If I was making money off this, it would so obviously be work I would have no excuse. It also might quickly destroy my intrinsic motivation. I am very worried about such things, and distortions of incentives to pay attention to numbers or incentive gradients rather than the things I have intrinsic motivation to work on. I’m meaning to write a post talking about the grave dangers of Karma systems to places like Less Wrong 2.0, because attaching numbers to things with rapid feedback is a deal with the devil and I’m quite worried the devil will end up winning. So an extra reason to keep on my toes about such things seems quite good, at least for now.</p><p>It comes down to, this is&nbsp;<i>my&nbsp;</i>day, and I need to do with it what I am driven to do – the very things that are under attack, and that I need my Slack in order to preserve. Otherwise, what was the point? But at some point this may reverse, and it will feel like pressure and work, and I hope I have the wisdom to change my rules to reflect this.</p><p>Note that I post my writing often on Saturday morning. That’s intentional. By timing my posts for Sabbath, I give everyone a full day to read and react before I have the chance to look at comments or votes or hits or anything else. That rabbit hole is bad, and I’m glad I have a way to avoid it.</p><p><strong>VII. Football</strong></p><p>Rationalists tend not to be sports fans. I think that’s a shame, for many reasons (that I hope to explain some time, but not now), but the key here is that I am the exception. Watching a good football game (Go Badgers!) is one of my great joys. However, it also involves television, and a giant array of possible games and lots of outside information running across the screen, so it’s dangerous. How to handle this?</p><p>My answer for now is that football is&nbsp;<i>being somewhere,&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>being in the moment.&nbsp;</i>That somewhere is elsewhere and that moment isn’t here, which are notches against. There is a screen involved, and that’s not great either. But sharing an experience with my fellow man of a story unfolding before us, of going through a ritual unique to the weekend where we celebrate the fruits of our hard work? Some friendly competition? That totally works for me. If I could walk to the stadium and hand them my (previously purchased) ticket, I wouldn’t bat an eye at that, it would be obviously great. If it was baseball, it would be&nbsp;even more obviously great, except that it wouldn’t be football, and also the Mets are awful.</p><p>So to the extent that I am&nbsp;<i>moving forward in time and being in the moment,&nbsp;</i>and watching a real-time story unfold as we journey through the season together, even if it is on tape delay, and to the extent that the games to watch have been chosen in advance (thus avoiding choice), I think this is fine. I think football (and College Gameday, which I enjoy the ritual of for reasons) are permissible and good in a way that most television would not be, and in a way that scripted dramas or comedies definitely would not be. It’s not a palliative, not in the same way, or at least it’s one I’m willing to allow.</p><p>A final good reason is that sports are cyclical. For five months we have football. For the remaining seven we don’t. That ensures we take a break.</p><p>Am I rationalizing and making excuses? Not impossible. It wouldn’t shock me if I realized this had to go and I moved my watching to Sunday.</p><p>Until then!</p><p><strong>VIII. Alarm</strong></p><p>There is a lot to be said for the strict version, where the rules are as they always have been. You don’t have to debate or choose or refine the rules, you only follow them. They do a very good job of forcing your hand, and of alerting you to how reliant you are on things you may not wish to be reliant on, allowing you to fix all that. Similarly, going camping without electronics is an eye opener, forcing your hand. I don’t think it’s a coincidence that both me and Ben Hoffman started our experiments after a camping trip.</p><p>For now, I’m going with the personalized hybrid version. I think that the act of thinking hard about what things I want to do without, what things I can do without, and what things I can’t do without, along with which things would enhance or degrade my experience, is exactly what will lead me to better understand how to handle these issues.</p><p>My worry is that this isn’t robust over time. Such a procedure requires buy-in, requires motivation. Customization means work. Traditions that survive need to survive for years and generations. If we are to form such a tradition, and I think that we should strive to do so, we will need it to be able to defend and pass itself down from father to son, from mother to daughter, to survive the constant pressures of the world. The constraint binds us, and we must consider it even now.</p><p>The first step, however, is still to take back our lives, protect ourselves to get to a place where we can think. This is one way that starts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure><img src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/thezvi.wordpress.com/15981/""></figure><figure><img src=""https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=thezvi.wordpress.com&amp;blog=21007166&amp;post=15981&amp;subd=thezvi&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1""></figure>",Zvi,zvi,Zvi,

It looks at why the feeling of vagueness might be deceptively comforting, and then it dives into explication as a potential solution.]</em></p><p>For many areas of life, I think we shy away from confronting uncertainty and instead flee into the comforting non-falsifiability of <strong>vagueness</strong>.</p><p>Consider these examples:</p><ol><li><p>You want to get things done today. You know that writing things down can help you finish more things. However, it feels aversive to write down what you specifically want to do. So instead, you don’t write things down and instead just keep a hazy notion of “I will do things today”.<br/> <br/></p></li><li><p>You try to make a confidence interval for a prediction where money is on the line. For example: “I am 90% sure Norway has between 100 and 1 billion people”. You notice yourself feeling uncomfortable, no matter what your bounds are. Somehow, it feels bad to set down <em>any number at all</em>, which is accompanied by a dread feeling of finality.<br/><br/></p></li><li><p>You’re trying to find solutions to a complex, entangled problem. Coming up with specific solutions feels bad because none of them seem to completely solve the problem. So instead you decide to go one level up. You end up just thinking about what properties a good solution should have in the first place and find yourself throwing around buzzwords like &quot;democracy&quot; and &quot;holistic workaround&quot;. </p></li></ol><p>In each of the above examples, it feels like we move away from making specific claims because that opens us up to specific criticism. But instead of trying to acknowledge that, we retreat to fuzzily-defined notions that allow us to incorporate any criticism without having to really update.</p><p>In other words, there’s a sense in which, in some areas of life, we’re embracing shoddy epistemology (EX: not wanting to validate or falsify our beliefs) because of a fear of being shown wrong.</p><p>I think this potential failure is what fuels the badness when we confront uncertainty.</p><p>It seems useful to face this feeling of badness or aversion with the understanding that this is what confronting uncertainty feels like. The best action doesn’t always feel comfortable and easy. It can just as easily feel aversive and final.</p><p>Look for situations where you might be flinching away from specificity by making vacuous claims that don’t say much at all.</p><p>When possible, try to explicate. <em>Be specific</em>.</p><p>Explicating and being specific opens up our plans and hypotheses to falsification; it leaves them vulnerable to being affected by evidence. Remaining uncertain means we can’t be shifted either way because we never made a strong statement in the first place.</p><p>We want our plans to fall in the face of contrary evidence. We want goals that are actually realistic. A vague goal means that we don’t aren’t required to specify what we actually want to get done, which clearly makes it harder to make progress on them. </p><p>Plus, vague goals give you more excuses to wiggle out of your own promises:</p><p>In my own case, there’s a secret part of me that is aversive to explicating; it wants to stay in the vagueness. On some level, I think that if I just under-specify what I’ll get done for today, then that leaves open the possibility that I’ll be able to somehow get all my work done. But things don’t actually work like that. It’s important, then, to try and decouple <em>wishes</em> from <em>predictions.</em></p><p>So there&#x27;s two things here: </p><p>One is about how, sometimes, the best action is actually still the one that feels uncertain and scary because confronting uncertainty is just a feature of our existence.</p><p>And the other thing is about how being specific can be a good way to solve part of the problem.</p><p>I claim that it’s the atomic, mechanistic actions which lead to things getting acted on. The real world runs on specifics—reality always has a Next Action. Thus, when we explicate the felt meaning in our heads, we’re also converting the nebulous feeling into a format that’s more workable in reality.</p><p style=""text-align:center;"">++++</p><h2><strong>Fading Novelty:</strong></h2><p><em>[Fading Novelty is about how the excitement of stuff can wear off after a while. This can make it harder to learn new stuff after you’ve been exposed to it for a while, and it seems like part of why Obvious stuff gets discarded by our brains.]</em></p><p>Male mammals tend to exhibit a frenzy of mating when first introduced to a female. After some time, they lose interest. Until a new female is introduced, that is, whereupon we tend to see renewed interest from the male. </p><p>This phenomenon is dubbed the Coolidge effect.</p><p>I find that the Coolidge effect seems analogous to the idea of fading novelty—the biological definition, that is—which is where something new eventually loses its special sheen. </p><p>For example, say Carrie gets a new plush cat. She looks at it on her bedside, and it has this sort of &quot;glow&quot; that makes it stand out compared to all her other things. Over time, though, her cat plush fades into the background and it no longer feels special.</p><p>I think this is a fairly universal feeling, despite there appearing to be very little about the high-level phenomena in the literature. (Which is why it’s here in an Interlude essay, rather than in a more well-researched essay.)</p><p>Other related ideas in this space include conditioning, tolerance, and acclimation; basically, situations where what was once a stressor no longer really elicits much of a response.</p><p>I’m interested in looking into fading novelty because it seems like part of the pedagogical problem with learning rationality goes something like this:</p><p>Alice learns about back-planning as a new planning skill. Empowered, she starts seeing ways to apply this idea everywhere. Armed with her new hammer, she makes some headway; progress is happening! </p><p>Soon, though, realizes that the back-planning idea now feels merely commonplace in her mind. The original feeling of “wow” has faded, and it feels less yummy to keep using the strategy because it&#x27;s no longer exciting. She stops using it, and there&#x27;s a general loss of excitement that used to be there.</p><p>As a result, I think that when we learn new insights, there is only a small window of time to capitalize on the novelty factor before it starts to feel boring.</p><p><strong> A “use it or lose it” phenomenon seems to happen, where either you actually form some new habits as a result of the short-lived excitement, or it falls, forgotten by the wayside.</strong></p><p>One reason could be because the novelty of the insight has faded, making it seem less exciting to use.</p><p>Now, to be clear, there <em>are</em> obvious reasons for wanting to keep fading novelty in humans:</p><p>Fading novelty is our first line of defense against getting stuck in loops. If repeated exposure to the same stimuli in normal contexts always triggered the same response, we’d likely get caught in repetitive actions where we wouldn’t feel incentivized to go off in the world and explore. </p><p>Secondly, there’d likely be sensory overload. We’d likely be overwhelmed with the novelty of everything all the time, which would undoubtedly make it far harder to focus on the important things.</p><p>However, I think it’s important to at least acknowledge that whenever learning rationality, which is insight-based, fading novelty can reduce the “yumminess” we initially feel towards practicing rationality techniques.</p><p>I also think it might be useful to have a few ways to, if not disable, but at least somewhat counter the fading novelty for things that we <em>want</em> to keep feeling new and exciting.</p><p>Here are some ideas I’ve brainstormed, along with some examples: (Note that the ideas below all sort of skirt around creating new novelty and don’t exactly give a good solution.)</p><h3><strong>1. Going Meta:</strong></h3><p>I touched on this in the end of the <a href=""https://www.lesserwrong.com/posts/PhHNTTHA5dtLsm7Gi/instrumental-rationality-1-starting-advice"">In Defense of the Obvious essay</a>, but this basically consists of noticing your lack of enthusiasm after the novelty fades and knowing that it was going to happen like this. I don’t think this brings back the sheen of novelty, but it feels related, so I included it here.</p><p>EX: Steve signed up for a difficult calculus course. After the initial excite of manipulating arcane symbols fades, Steve realizes the class is a lot of work. Still, he <em>knew</em> this when he signed up, so he&#x27;s able to gather back some of his initial fire by knowing everything is All Part Of The Plan.</p><h3><strong>2. Quick Feedback/Incentives/Rewards:</strong></h3><p>I also think there’s a sense in where, if the action you’re doing produces some sort of reward/incentive, you’ll probably also feel compelled to do it, in a sense independent of novelty. Think checking Facebook, which keeps you craving that delicious red number hanging on the right edge of the globe icon and how satisfying it feels to click it, over and over, time and time again. We&#x27;ll come back to this a little more in section 4 about habits.</p><p>EX: When I was practicing coin magic in front of a mirror, getting instant visual feedback on my sleight of hand was immediately rewarding, which kept me practicing, even when the novelty of the trick itself faded.</p><h3><strong>3. Habituate It:</strong></h3><p>Obviously if you’ve managed to turn the task into a habit, then you don’t need to worry about all this “cultivating novelty” stuff. You’ll just end up…doing it. The next section, Habits 101, will go into far more detail.</p><p>EX: Turning journaling into a daily habit so I don’t need to rely on the motivation boost from novelty.</p><h3><strong> 4. Contrasting</strong></h3><p>Humans are pretty relative. We compare things with regards to our immediate past as reference points. The idea here is that you&#x27;d try to reset your &quot;zero-points&quot; for different things by alternating between ascetic and normal states to improve appreciation of the basic stuff.</p><p>EX: Deliberately not thinking much for a few days to improve appreciation of thinking.  Or, deliberately fasting to improve the taste of food.</p><h2 style=""text-align:center;""><a href=""https://www.lesserwrong.com/posts/bxc6Box8JJbzv3oQt/instrumental-rationality-4-1-modeling-habits""><strong>Next essay</strong></a></h2><p></p></div></div></div></div>",,,,

It&#x27;s also how I plan to go to events, talk to my best friends, and stay up to date on developments in my field. </p></li><li><p>More broadly: online friendships, learning everything about anything, finding communities, making art for fun, finding out you&#x27;re not alone in meaningful ways, changing your life path and worldview, watching Jessica Jones, etc. This includes reflection, relaxation, connection, opportunities for introspection, etc.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>A lot of social media is mindlessly looking for attention and crafting an image. Sure. I guess this is a little concerning, but a lot of any interaction is this. Did you know people used to wear corsets? Daily? That was probably just rich people, I&#x27;m not sure, but... petticoats? <em>Bustles</em>? What do you think makeup or a tie is? At least when I spend five minutes anhedonically refreshing Tumblr to see if anyone liked my meme, I can do it from my home in sweatpants.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>When people have no enjoyable spare time, or literally cannot take a day off work once a week, I think that mostly, they already have correctly recognized that this a problem, and would vastly prefer that this not be the case. </p><ul><li><p>(I wonder if the authors are thinking specifically of Silicon Valley-type people who make vast amounts of money and still work 10-hour days and don&#x27;t take weekends off. If this is the case, I&#x27;m sympathetic but perhaps a specifically directed appeal is in order - I think these are the minority of people who are overworked.)</p></li></ul></li><li><p>It would certainly be nice if I could walk to my friends&#x27; and partners’ houses, but this problem is actually frequently solved by public transit and cars. When it&#x27;s not, or you know you&#x27;d be much happier if you moved but can&#x27;t, see the previous bullet point.</p></li><li><p>Etc.</p></li></ul><p>I&#x27;m sure lots of people could use more slack or leisure in their life, or the ability to step away from technology, and should try these things out and critically examine their relationship with social media and how it makes them feel. I think some of the described dynamics are real.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, I&#x27;m unconvinced by the implication that social media and technology don&#x27;t afford slack or leisure, that a person using a lot of social media &quot;lacks free speech, free association, free taste and free thought&quot;, or that I&#x27;m in danger or that my life is actively falling apart. Maybe I&#x27;m not seeing something, but what I&#x27;ve read on LW feels like slightly-better-thought-out “selfies are the downfall of civilization”-type thinkpieces, and I’m about as motivated to do anything now as I am after reading those.</p></div></div></div></div>",eukaryote,eukaryote,eukaryote,

<p>My name is Trent Fowler, and I'm an aspiring futurist. To date I have given talks on two continents on machine ethics, AI takeoff dynamics, secular spirituality, existential risk, the future of governance, and technical rationality. I have written on introspection, the interface between language and cognition, the evolution of intellectual frameworks, and myriad other topics. In 2016 I began 'The STEMpunk Project', an endeavor to learn as much about computing, electronics, mechanics, and AI as possible, which culminated in a book published earlier this year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elon Musk is my spirit animal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am planning to found a futurist institute in Boulder, CO. I actually left my cushy job in East Asia to help make the future a habitable place.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there someone I could talk to about how to do this? Should I incorporate as a 501C3 or an LLC? What are the best ways of monetizing such an endeavor? How can I build an audience (meetup attendance has been anemic at best, what can I do about that)? And so on.&nbsp;</p>

If you gave off the impression of being more capable than you really were, then being overconfident and bluffing could frighten stronger opponents and avoid direct conflict.</p><p>When it comes to making plans in the modern day, however, overconfidence in planning can be unhelpful. You might be able to convince everyone (including yourself) that you’ll finish that report in three days, but, if you don’t put in the effort, it’ll still really take you a week.</p><p>There’s a lot of evidence that suggests that our thinking is often subject to the planning fallacy, a tendency to make unrealistic predictions and plans.</p><p>Below is a scattering of stats and examples from different fields to guide your intuitions at the phenomenon I’m talking about:</p><p>First, some students were asked to predict when they were 99% sure they’d finish a project. But when the researchers actually followed up with them, we found that only about 45%, less than half of the students, had actually finished by their own predicted times *1.</p><p>In a related study, students were asked to predict when they’d finish, “assuming everything went as poor as it possibly could.” Basically, their worst-case scenario. Yet, only about 30% of students finished by their own self-appointed estimate *2.</p></div></div></div></div><div class=""ory-row ory-cell-inner""><div class=""ory-cell ory-cell-sm-12 ory-cell-xs-12""><div class=""ory-cell-inner ory-cell-leaf""><div><img class=""ory-plugins-content-image"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*KN-bNtgK-CWEaCIj8PpJYw.png""/></div></div></div></div><div class=""ory-row ory-cell-inner""><div class=""ory-cell ory-cell-sm-12 ory-cell-xs-12""><div class=""ory-cell-inner ory-cell-leaf""><div style=""border:solid 1px;border-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.12);"" class=""ory-plugins-content-spacer ory-plugins-content-spacer-read-only""><div style=""height:42px;""></div></div></div></div></div><div class=""ory-row ory-cell-inner""><div class=""ory-cell ory-cell-sm-12 ory-cell-xs-12""><div class=""ory-cell-inner ory-cell-leaf""><div><p>In fact, similar results were also found in Japanese and Canadian cultures, giving evidence that this is a human (and not US-culture-based) phenomenon. Students continued to make overly optimistic predictions, <em>even when they knew the task had taken them longer last time</em> *3.</p><p>I don’t mean to just pick on students, though. The planning fallacy is present in many, many sectors.</p><p>For example, an overview of public transportation projects found that most of them were, on average, 20-45% above the estimated cost. Research has shown that these poor predictions haven’t improved at all in the past 30 years *4.</p><p>And there’s no shortage of high-profile examples, from the Scottish Parliament Building, which cost 10 times more than expected, to the Denver International Airport, which, by some estimates, took 16 months longer and $2 billion more than initially anticipated.</p><p>Other fields like tech and finance have their own share of overconfident estimates which fail to come true, from the information technology sector’s roughly 33% success rate for on-time project completion, to CFOs making having grossly overconfident judgments *5 *6.</p><p>If you couple the above data with some of your own experiences with far-too optimistic predictions, this hopefully paints a picture of how reality consistently fails to meet our expectations. </p><p>My goal here is to drive home the point that you, just like everyone else, are also susceptible to these errors in planning. </p><p style=""text-align:center;"">++++</p><h2 style=""text-align:left;""><strong>Modeling the Planning Fallacy:</strong></h2><p style=""text-align:left;""><em>[We go over several models of how to think about the brain and the estimates it makes. I think that the inside / outside view distinction is the most useful one, and it’ll be the one I focus on]</em></p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Here, we’ll go over some simplified models of what’s happening inside our heads when the planning fallacy occurs.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">First, there are some fairly basic potential explanations for our overly optimistic estimates. </p><p style=""text-align:left;"">For one, we might just be misremembering the actual details of how things played out in the past. It seems that we may underestimate how long things take us, and this can even occur in our memories, which leads us to make messed-up estimates *7.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">On another level, it seems that we just don’t expect things to go wrong. Studies have found that we’re biased towards not looking at pessimistic scenarios *8. </p><p style=""text-align:left;"">There are lots of unknown unknowns in any situation, things we just won’t see coming. Yet, even if we know that unexpected events will occur, this doesn’t move us to take extra precautions.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">We often just assume the best-case scenario when making plans, and we might miss out on relevant outside information.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">This leads us to the model of the <strong>inside view</strong> and the <strong>outside view</strong>, which is what I think to be one of the best models for explaining this bias *9. </p></div></div></div></div><div class=""ory-row ory-cell-inner""><div class=""ory-cell ory-cell-sm-12 ory-cell-xs-12""><div class=""ory-cell-inner ory-cell-leaf""><div><img class=""ory-plugins-content-image"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*aZp-28OepZ5U1eVvYoHgbg.png""/></div></div></div></div><div class=""ory-row ory-cell-inner""><div class=""ory-cell ory-cell-sm-12 ory-cell-xs-12""><div class=""ory-cell-inner ory-cell-leaf""><div style=""border:solid 1px;border-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.12);"" class=""ory-plugins-content-spacer ory-plugins-content-spacer-read-only""><div style=""height:41px;""></div></div></div></div></div><div class=""ory-row ory-cell-inner""><div class=""ory-cell ory-cell-sm-12 ory-cell-xs-12""><div class=""ory-cell-inner ory-cell-leaf""><div><p style=""text-align:left;"">The <strong>inside view</strong> is the information you have about your specific project, or information inside your head. It’s the information that only someone inside the project would have. </p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Here are some examples of inside view thinking:</p><ol><li><p>You are writing an essay. You consider your topic, how much you know about the topic, and perhaps how much ink you have left in your pen. Then you predict how long you think it’ll take to finish writing the essay.<br/></p></li><li><p>You are running in a marathon. Halfway through, you check your energy level, how sore your muscles are, and if you’re hydrated. Then you make a prediction about what place you’ll finish.<br/></p></li><li><p>You just finished a very difficult math quiz. You think about the specific problems you had trouble with, the problems you felt were easy, and then you try to predict what score you’ll get on the quiz.</p></li></ol><p>The inside view tends to focus on <em>you</em>. It’s about your strengths, abilities, limits, and things within your control. However, as any person in a traffic jam can tell you, it’s often the things beyond our control that have the greatest impact. </p><p>In these cases, the best we can do is to adapt to them as they show up.</p><p>In general, we seem to use inside view thinking when we make plans, and this is the source of our overconfidence. We’re focused on how we can help our project go <em>right</em>, rather than the things that can make our project go <em>wrong</em>. </p><p>This intuitive planning strategy can miss out on the unknown unknowns that are out there in the real world, leading us to make plans which fail to meet reality’s standards.</p><p>This is where the <strong>outside view</strong> comes in.</p><p>The outside view is information about all projects similar to yours that have happened, or what someone on the outside might say about your project. It’s about how well you are doing, compared to others doing something similar. </p><p>Where the inside view focuses on your individual strengths, the outside view looks at averages, the environment, and the things around you. </p><p>Here are some examples of outside view thinking applied to the above examples:</p><ol><li><p>You are writing an essay. Instead of considering the specific topic, you look back to how long it took you to write essays in the past. On average, you finished within 40-50 minutes, so you predict that you’ll probably take about that long this time.<br/></p></li><li><p>You are running in a marathon. Even though you feel pretty good, you see that there are already 4 people ahead of you. Also, you finished 7th in the last few marathons. So, chances are, you’ll probably finish 6th or 7th place this time, despite what your body is signaling to you.<br/></p></li><li><p>You just finished a very difficult math quiz. The teacher said that most of the class got close to a 60%. Even though you felt like you knew most of the answers, you predict that you probably also got close to 60%, maybe a little higher.</p></li></ol><p>With these examples, I hope you get the basic idea of the distinction between the two ways of making plans. </p><p>Relating it back to the typical System 1 and System 2 model, the inside view is closer to a S1 process, as it’s our intuitive, default planning strategy. The outside view requires some additional thought (and perhaps research), making it more of a S2-type process.</p><p style=""text-align:center;"">++++</p><h2 style=""text-align:left;""><strong>3 Techniques to Improve Planning:</strong></h2><p style=""text-align:left;"">We’ll be covering three techniques to help with improving your plans: <strong>Murphyjitsu</strong>, <strong>Reference Class Forecasting (RCF)</strong>, and <strong>Back-planning (aka &quot;backchaining&quot;)</strong>. </p><ol><li><p>Murphyjitsu is a little like using your brain’s built-in system to analyze for potential problems.</p></li><li><p>RCF is flat-out using past history to improve your predictions.</p></li><li><p>Back-planning is like planning.

You’re confident you can finish before the hour is over. What could go wrong? Closing Facebook, you begin to start typing.</em></p><p style=""text-align:left;""><em>Suddenly, you hear a loud </em>CRACK<em>! </em></p><p style=""text-align:left;""><em>A burst of light floods your room as a figure pops into existence, dark and silhouetted by the brightness behind it. The light recedes, and the figure crumples to the ground. Floating in the air is a whirring gizmo, filled with turning gears. Strangely enough, your attention is drawn from the gizmo to the person on the ground:</em></p><p style=""text-align:left;""><em>The figure has a familiar sort of shape. You approach, tentatively, and find the splitting image of yourself! The person stirs and speaks.</em></p><p style=""text-align:left;""><em>“I’m you from one week into the future,” your future self croaks. Your future self tries to tries to get up, but sinks down again.</em></p><p style=""text-align:left;""><em>“Oh,” you say.</em></p><p style=""text-align:left;""><em>“I came from the future to tell you…” your temporal clone says in a scratched voice.</em></p><p style=""text-align:left;""><em>“To tell me what?” you ask. Already, you can see the whispers of a scenario forming in your head…</em></p><p style=""text-align:left;""><em>Future You slowly says, “To tell you… that the report on intertemporal travel that you were going to write… won’t go as planned at all. It failed.”</em></p><p style=""text-align:left;""><em>“Oh no!” you say.</em></p><p style=""text-align:left;""><em>Somehow, though, you aren’t surprised…</em></p><h4 style=""text-align:left;""><strong>At this point, what plausible reasons for your failure come to mind?</strong></h4><p style=""text-align:left;"">For example, if you’re trying to write a blog post, you could imagine that you woke up the next day and no words got written. When in that scenario, what is the plausible explanation which explains things?</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Maybe it’s that you stayed out too late with friends, or that you forgot about the task, or that you left your power cord in the office.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Whatever explanation, <em>that</em> is likely to be one of the most likely things that will derail your blog post tonight. Now that you’ve done Murphyjitsu, you can try to patch the problem by perhaps telling your friends that you need to get home by a certain time.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">It turns out that putting ourselves in the future and looking back can help identify more risks, or see where things can go wrong. Prospective hindsight has been shown to increase our predictive power so we can make adjustments to our plans—before they fail *11. </p><p style=""text-align:left;"">In short, you&#x27;re trying to see likely potential failure modes, by doing a “surprise check” with your gut by asking yourself the question “Would I be surprised if I learned that this plan failed?”</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">It might feel a little weird to rely on your intuition or gut feeling to look for potential failure modes. But remember that it’s not just “coming out of nowhere”!. Your System 1 <em>does have</em> information. You’ve got a rich history of experiences to rely on (just from being alive!), and the Murphyjitsu procedure is designed to try and take advantage of those intuitions.</p><p style=""text-align:center;"">++++</p><h3 style=""text-align:left;""><strong>Technique:</strong></h3><p style=""text-align:left;"">Here are the basic steps of Murphyjitsu:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Figure out your goal.

That’ll be my goal.”<br/></em></p></li><li><p><strong>Write down which specific things you need to get done to make the thing happen. (Make a list.)<br/></strong>EX: <em>“But I should also be more specific than that, so it’s easier to tell what ‘exercising’ means. Let’s decide that I want to go running on odd days for 30 minutes and do strength training on even days for 20 minutes. And I want to do them in the evenings.”<br/></em></p></li><li><p><strong>Now imagine it’s one week (or month) later, and yet you somehow didn’t manage to get started on your goal. (The visualization part here is important.) Are you surprised?<br/></strong>EX: <em>“Now, let’s imagine that it’s now one week later, and I didn’t go exercising at all! What went wrong?”<br/></em></p></li><li><p><strong>Why? (What went wrong that got in your way?)<br/></strong>EX: <em>“The first thing that comes to mind is that I forgot to remind myself, and it just slipped out of my mind”<br/></em></p></li><li><p><strong>Now imagine you take steps to remove the obstacle from Step 4.<br/></strong>EX: <em>“Well, what if I set some phone / email reminders? Is that good enough?”<br/></em></p></li><li><p><strong>Return to Step 3. Are you still surprised that you’d fail? If so, your plan is probably good enough. (Don’t fool yourself!)<br/></strong>EX: <em>“Once again, let’s imagine it’s one week later and I made a reminder. But let’s say I still didn’t got exercising. How surprising is this?”<br/></em></p></li><li><p><strong>If failure still seems likely, go through Steps 3-6 a few more times until you “problem proof” your plan.<br/></strong>EX: <em>“Hmm, I can see myself getting sore and/or putting other priorities before it…</em><strong><em>(Step 4)</em></strong><em>. So maybe I’ll also set aside the same time every day, so I can’t easily weasel out </em><strong><em>(Step 5)</em></strong><em>.<br/>How do I feel now? </em><strong><em>(Back to Step 3)</em></strong><em> Well, if once again I imagine it’s one week later and I once again failed, I’d be pretty surprised.

We’re not 100% sure.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">The general gist of these theories is that back-planning is a weird, counter-intuitive way to think about things, which means it disrupts a lot of mental processes that can lead to overconfidence *14.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">This means that back-planning can make it harder to fall into the groove of the easy “super optimistic best-case” planning we default to. Instead, we need to actually look at where things might go wrong. Which is, of course, what we want. </p><p style=""text-align:left;"">In my own experience, I’ve found that going through a quick back-planning session can help my intuitions “warm up” to my prediction more. </p><p style=""text-align:left;"">For example, I’ll sometimes use RCF to get a more accurate time estimate, but it still feels “off”. Walking through the plan through back-planning can help all the parts of me understand that it really will probably take longer.</p><p style=""text-align:center;"">++++</p><h3 style=""text-align:left;""><strong>Technique:</strong></h3><p style=""text-align:left;"">Here are the steps for back-planning:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Figure out the task you want to get done.<br/></strong>EX: <em>“Right now, I want to host a talk at my school. I know that’s the end goal.”<br/></em></p></li><li><p><strong>Imagine you’re at the end of your task.<br/></strong>EX: <em>“So the end goal is me actually finishing the talk and taking questions.”<br/></em></p></li><li><p><strong>Now move backwards, step-by-step. What is the step right before you finish?<br/></strong>EX: <em>“What happens right before that? Well, people would need to actually be in the room. And I would have needed a room. <br/></em></p></li><li><p><strong>Repeat Step 3 until you get to where you are now.<br/></strong>EX: <em>“Is that all? </em><strong><em>(Step 3)</em></strong><em>. Also, for people to show up, I would have needed publicity. Probably also something on social media. I’d need to publicize at least a week in advance, or else it won’t be common knowledge.<br/>And what about the actual talk? I would have needed slides, maybe memorize my talk. Also, I’d need to figure out what my talk is actually going to be on.”<br/></em></p></li><li><p><strong>Write down how long you think the task will now take you.<br/></strong>EX: <em>“Huh, thinking it through like this, I’d need something like 3 weeks to get it done. One week for the actual slides, one week for publicity (at least), and one week for everything else that might go wrong.<br/>That feels more ‘right’ than my initial estimate of ‘I can do this by next week’.”<br/></em></p></li><li><p><strong>You now have a detailed plan as well as a better prediction!<br/></strong>EX: <em>“Hooray!”</em></p></li></ol><p style=""text-align:center;"">++++</p><h2 style=""text-align:left;""><strong>Conclusion:</strong></h2><p style=""text-align:left;"">We’ve gone over several ways in which planning can hopefully be improved with some careful thinking. Hopefully I’ve showed that both your intuitions and reasoned analysis can provide useful data.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">I think many of the considerations I outlined above in planning are great to keep in mind, but it’s also quite unrealistic to expect you to remember all of them when actually making plans.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">I wholeheartedly endorse sacrificing some of the detail for speed. Finding a way to run these planning checks at the 5-second level is really what’s probably going to be really practical.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Happy planning!</p><p style=""text-align:center;"">++++</p><h3 style=""text-align:left;""><strong>References (*):</strong></h3><p style=""text-align:left;"">1.

A large part of our performance rework was sadly somewhat stopped in its tracks by a <a href=""https://github.com/meteor/meteor/issues/9182"">bug in Meteor</a> I ended up discovering, so some of the biggest gains will have to wait until that has been fixed.

We will continue to focus on performance improvements for now, but from now on things will be more incremental, and so you should see more frequent updates and faster bugfixes. </p></div></div></div></div>",habryka4,habryka4,habryka,
zfeWGvTrS6wKQeeoF,SSC Survey Results On Trust,ssc-survey-results-on-trust,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/zfeWGvTrS6wKQeeoF/ssc-survey-results-on-trust,2017-10-06T05:40:00.269Z,7,5,2,False,False,,"<p><A HREF=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/10/02/different-worlds/"">Last post</A> talked about individual differences in whether people found others basically friendly or hostile. The <A HREF=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/17/ssc-survey-2017-results/"">SSC survey</A> included a sort of related question: &#8220;Are people basically trustworthy?&#8221; </p>
<p>The exact phrasing asked respondents to rate other people from 1 (&#8220;basically trustworthy&#8221;) to 5 (&#8220;basically untrustworthy&#8221;). 4853 people answered. The average was 2.49 &#8211; so skewed a bit towards higher trust. The overall pattern looked like this:</p>
<p><center><IMG SRC=""http://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/trustworthy.png""></center></p>
<p>Trust didn&#8217;t differ by gender. Women averaged 2.56 and men 2.48, not a significant difference even with our fantastic sample size.</p>
<p>And I couldn&#8217;t detect it differing by race. Whites averaged 2.47 and nonwhites 2.59, which was nonsignificant despite decent sample size. Blacks were 2.81 and trended toward significance vs. whites, but the sample size was too small to be sure.</p>
<p>And I couldn&#8217;t detect it differing by religiousity. Committed theists (n = 506) had a trust level of 2.54, no more or less trusting than the average (and mostly atheist) SSC population.</p>
<p>And I couldn&#8217;t detect it differing by intelligence. There was no correlation between trust and either IQ or SAT score. There <i>was</i> a significant difference (p = 0.001) based on education level, all the way from PhDs at 2.35 to high school graduates only at 2.62. </p>
<p>There were some decent-sized differences among different US states, with more urban and liberal states being more trusting. Among the states with decent sample size, California (n = 608) was 2.43, New York (n = 298) was 2.47, and Texas (n = 143) was 2.75; the California/Texas difference was significant at p = 0.001. I was only able to eyeball rather than actually significance-test the urban/liberal correlation, but it looked pretty strong.</p>
<p>There were similar differences between countries. Germany (n = 192) at 2.35, the UK (n = 353) at 2.37, and Canada (n = 2.39) were all significantly more trusting than the US (n = 3124) at 2.53 &#8211; but obviously the effect wasn&#8217;t too impressive. There were only two non-western countries with remotely usable sample sizes. Brazil (n = 28) was 2.89, and India (n = 27) was 2.81. The non-western/Anglosphere difference was significant even with the low sample size. The most trusting city in the world was Toronto (n = 60), at 2.23.</p>
<p>There were so many professions, with such small sample sizes, that I wasn&#8217;t really confident any of them were much more or less trusting than others. But for what it&#8217;s worth, the number one least trusting profession, at 3.00, was mental health, and I am 100% not at all surprised. Otherwise there seemed to be a weak trend for nerdier and math-ier professions to be more trusting than others.</p>
<p>By politics, the ranking looked like this:</p>
<p>Social democratic: 2.38<br />
Liberal: 2.40<br />
Libertarian: 2.48<br />
Conservative: 2.67<br />
Communist: 2.80<br />
Neoreactionary: 2.97<br />
Alt-right: 2.97</p>
<p>Looks like the same trend of conservative = less trusting. Harder to figure out what to think about left vs. liberal, given the social democrats in the lead vs. communists very far behind.</p>
<p>Effective altruists who had taken the GWWC Pledge were much more trusting &#8211; 2.19 &#8211; than any other natural group I could find in this survey, more trusting even than Torontoans. After some work, I managed to find an unnatural group that beat them. Polyamorous Less Wrong readers from California &#8211; my proxy for the real-life Bay Area rationalist community &#8211; had a trust score of 2.13.</p>
<p>I had wondered if more trusting people would want less strict moderation, but the opposite was actually true &#8211; less trusting people wanted weaker moderation. Maybe this is mediated by conservativism &#8211; or maybe they just don&#8217;t trust me to moderate!</p>
<p>Autism, anxiety, OCD, and drug use all lowered trust; depression and bipolar disorder did not.</p>
<p>People who put down &#8220;Other&#8221; in any category were always much less trusting than any of the options, almost as if they didn&#8217;t trust people to accurately interpret the binned choices.</p>
<p>If you want to look into this yourself, you can find the data publicly available <A HREF=""http://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/survey/Survey_Excel.xls"">here</A>, but be warned &#8211; predictably, the people who agreed to let me make their data public were systematically more trusting (2.49) than the people who refused (2.70).</p>",Yvain,scottalexander,Scott Alexander,

Michael <a href=""https://www.lesserwrong.com/posts/ikMvvDgzFCSrYMRfd/the-problematic-third-person-perspective/77Wy2hxfJB8sRuest"">pointed out a possibility</a> for downside risk with losing mathematical ability, which initially made me update away from the view here. However, some experience noticing what it is like to make certain kinds of mathematical progress made me return to the view presented here. Maybe don&#x27;t take this post as inspiration to engage in extreme rejection of objectivity.]</em></p><p>There are a number of conversational norms based on the idea of an imaginary impartial observer who needs to be convinced. It&#x27;s the adversarial courtroom model of conversation. Better norms, such as <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/o6p/double_crux_a_strategy_for_resolving_disagreement/"">common crux</a>, can be established by recognizing that a conversation is taking place between two people.</p><p>Burden-of-proof is one of these problematic ideas. The idea that there is some kind of standard which would put the burden on one person or another would only make sense if there were a judge to convince. If anything, it would be better to say the burden of proof is on both people in any argument, in the sense that they are responsible for conveying their own views to the other person. If burden-of-proof is about establishing that they &quot;should&quot; give in to your position, it accomplishes nothing; you need to convince <em>them</em> of that, not yourself. If burden-of-proof is about establishing that you don&#x27;t have to believe them until they say more... well, that was true anyway, but perhaps speaks to a lack of curiosity on your part.</p><p>More generally, this external-judge intuition promotes the bad model that there are objective standards of logic which must be adhered to in a debate. There <em>are</em> epistemic standards which it is <em>good</em> to adhere to, including logic and notions of probabilistic evidence. But, if the other person has different standards, then you have to either work with them or discuss the differences. There&#x27;s a failure mode of the overly rationalistic where you just get angry that <em>their</em> arguments are illogical and they&#x27;re not accepting <em>your</em> perfectly-formatted arguments, so you try to get them to bow down to your standards by force of will. (The same failure mode applies to treating definitions as objective standards which must be adhered to.) What good does it do to continue arguing with them via standards you already know differ from theirs? Try to understand and engage with their real reasons rather than replacing them with imaginary things.</p><p>Actually, it&#x27;s even worse than this, because you don&#x27;t know your own standards of evidence completely. So, the imaginary impartial judge is also interfering with your ability to get in touch with your real reasons, what you really think, and what might sway you one way or the other. If your mental motion is to reach for justifications which the impartial judge would accept, you are rationalizing rather than finding <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/wj/is_that_your_true_rejection/"">your true rejection</a>. You have to realize that you&#x27;re using standards of evidence that you yourself don&#x27;t fully understand, and live in that world -- otherwise you <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/lw/p80/in_praise_of_fake_frameworks/"">rob yourself of the ability to improve your tools</a>.</p><p>This happens in two ways, that I can think of.</p><ul><li>Maybe your explicit standards are good, but not perfect. You notice beliefs that are not up to your standards, and you drop them reflexively. This might be a good idea most of the time, but there are two things wrong with the policy. First, you might have dropped a good belief. You could have done better by checking which you trusted more in this instance: the beliefs, or your standards of belief. Second, you&#x27;ve missed an opportunity to improve your explicit standards. You could have explored your reasons for believing what you did, and compared them to your explicit standards for belief.</li><li>Maybe you don&#x27;t notice the difference between your explicit standards and the way you actually arrive at your beliefs. You assume implicitly that if you believe something strongly, it&#x27;s because there are strong reasons of the sort you endorse. This is especially likely if the beliefs pattern-match to the sort of thing your standards endorse; for example, being very sciency. As a result, you miss an opportunity to notice that you&#x27;re rationalizing something. You would have done better to first look for the reasons you <em>really</em> believed the thing, and then check whether they meet your explicit standards and whether the belief still seems worth endorsing.</li></ul><p>So far, I&#x27;ve argued that the imaginary judge creates problems in two domains: navigating disagreements with other people, and navigating your own epistemic standards. I&#x27;ll note a third domain where the judge seems problematic: judging your own actions and decisions. Many people use an <a href=""https://weird.solar/the-internal-lawyer-b00625428e1e"">imaginary judge</a> to guide their actions. This leads to pitfalls such as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-licensing"">moral self-licensing</a>, in which doing good things gives you a license to do more bad things (setting up a budget makes you feel good enough about your finances that you can go on a spending spree, eating a salad for lunch makes you more likely to treat yourself with ice cream after work, etc). Getting rid of the internal judge is an instance of Nate&#x27;s <a href=""http://mindingourway.com/guilt/"">Replacing Guilt</a>, and carries similar risks: if you&#x27;re currently using the internal judge for a bunch of important things, you have to either make sure you replace it with other working strategies, or be OK with kicking those things to the roadside (at least temporarily).</p><p>Similarly with the other two categories I mentioned. Noticing the dysfunctions of the imaginary-judge perspective should not make you immediately remove it; invoke Chesterton&#x27;s Fence. However, I would encourage you to experiment with removing the imaginary third person from your conversations, and seeing what you do when you remind yourself that there&#x27;s no one looking over your shoulder in your private mental life. I think this relates to a larger ontological shift which Val was also pointing toward in <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/p80/in_praise_of_fake_frameworks/"">In Praise of Fake Frameworks</a>. There is no third-person perspective. There is no view from nowhere. This isn&#x27;t a rejection of reductionism, but a reminder that we haven&#x27;t finished yet. This isn&#x27;t a rejection of the principles of rationality, but a reminder that we are <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/rs/created_already_in_motion/"">created already in motion</a>, and there is no argument so persuasive it would move a rock. </p><p>And, more basically, it is a reminder that the map is not the territory, because humans confuse the two by default. The picture in your head isn&#x27;t what&#x27;s there to be seen. Putting pieces of your judgement inside an imaginary impartial judge doesn&#x27;t automatically make it true. Perhaps it does really make it more trustworthy -- you &quot;promote&quot; your better heuristics by wrapping them up inside the judge, giving them authority over the rest. But, this system has its problems. It can create perverse incentives on the other parts of your mind, to please the judge in ways that let them get away with what they want. It can make you blind to other ways of being. It can make you <em>think</em> you&#x27;ve avoided map-territory confusion once and for all -- &quot;See? It&#x27;s written right there on my soul: DO NOT CONFUSE MAP AND TERRITORY. It is simply something I don&#x27;t do.&quot; -- while really passing the responsibility to a special part of your map which is now almost <em>always</em> confused for the territory.</p><p>So, laugh at the judge a little. Look out for your real reasons for thinking and doing things. Notice whether your arguments seem tailored to convince your judge rather than the person in front of you. See where it leads you.</p>",abramdemski,abramdemski,abramdemski,

<p><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/5bd75cc58225bf067037546b/delegative-inverse-reinforcement-learning"">Previously</a>, we defined a setting called ""Delegative Inverse Reinforcement Learning"" (DIRL) in which the agent can delegate actions to an ""advisor"" and the reward is only visible to the advisor as well. We proved a sublinear regret bound (converted to traditional normalization in online learning, the bound is <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""O(n^{2/3})""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">O</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">(</span></span><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">n</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sup"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: 0.513em; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-texatom"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mn""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">2</span></span><span class=""mjx-texatom""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">/</span></span></span></span><span class=""mjx-mn""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">3</span></span></span></span></span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">)</span></span></span></span></span></span>) for one-shot DIRL (as opposed to standard regret bounds in RL which are only applicable in the <em>episodic</em> setting). However, this required a rather strong assumption about the advisor: in particular, the advisor had to choose the optimal action with maximal likelihood. Here, we consider ""Delegative Reinforcement Learning"" (DRL), i.e. a similar setting in which the reward is directly observable by the agent. We also restrict our attention to finite MDP environments (we believe these results can be generalized to a much larger class of environments, but not to arbitrary environments). On the other hand, the assumption about the advisor is much weaker: the advisor is only required to avoid <em>catastrophic</em> actions (i.e. actions that lose value to zeroth order in the interest rate) and assign some positive probability to a nearly optimal action. As before, we prove a one-shot regret bound (in traditional normalization, <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""O(n^{3/4})""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">O</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">(</span></span><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">n</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sup"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: 0.513em; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-texatom"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mn""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">3</span></span><span class=""mjx-texatom""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">/</span></span></span></span><span class=""mjx-mn""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">4</span></span></span></span></span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">)</span></span></span></span></span></span>).

<p>Of course, this requirement is still unrealistic for humans in the real world. In particular, it makes the formalism unsuitable for modeling the use of AI for catastrophe mitigation (which is ultimately what we are interested in!) since it assumes the advisor is already capable of avoiding any catastrophe. In following work, we plan to relax the assumptions further.</p>

<p>Say that I have a day off, and there&#8217;s nothing in particular that I need to get done or think about. This makes it easy for the <em>spatial</em> scope of my experience to become close. My attention is most strongly drawn to the sensations of my body, nearby sounds, tempting nearby things like the warmth of the shower that I could take, the taste of a cup tea that I could prepare, or the pleasant muscle fatigue that I&#8217;d get if I went jogging in the nearby forest. The <em>temporal</em> scope of my experience is close as well; these are all things that are nearby in time, in that I could do them within a few minutes of having decided to do them.</p>
<p>Say that I don&#8217;t have a day off, and I&#8217;m trying to focus on work. My <a href=""https://foundational-research.org/"">employer&#8217;s website</a> says that <em>our research focuses on reducing risks of dystopian futures in the context of emerging technologies</em>; this is a pretty accurate description of what I try to do. Our focus is on really large-scale stuff, including the <a href=""https://foundational-research.org/risks-of-astronomical-future-suffering/"">consequences of eventual space colonization</a>; this requires thinking in the scale of galaxies, a vast spatial scope. And we are also trying to figure out whether there is anything we can do to meaningfully influence the far future, including hundreds if not thousands of years from now; that means taking a vast temporal scope.</p>
<p>It is perhaps no surprise that it is much easier to feel that things are meaningful when the scope of my experience is close, than when it is far.</p>
<hr />
<p>My favorite theory of meaning actually comes from a slightly surprising direction: the literature on game design and analysis. In <a href=""https://smile.amazon.com/Rules-Play-Design-Fundamentals-Press/dp/0262240459/"">Rules of Play: Game Design Fundamentals</a>, Katie Salen and Eric Zimmerman <a href=""https://books.google.se/books?id=UM-xyczrZuQC&amp;lpg=PT16&amp;ots=2BCJt_8AWs&amp;pg=PT16#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"">define <em>meaningful play</em></a> in a game as emerging when the relationships between actions and outcomes are both discernable and integrated into the larger context of the game. In other words:</p>
<p>The consequences of your actions in a game have to be <em>discernable: </em>you need to have some idea of <em>what</em> happened as a result of your actions. If you shoot at an opponent and the opponent dies, that&#8217;s pretty clear and discernable. If you press a button and a number changes but you have no idea of what that number means or why it&#8217;s relevant, that&#8217;s not very clear nor discernable. If you don&#8217;t know what happens as a result of your actions, you might as well be randomly pressing buttons or throwing down cards.</p>
<p>The consequences of your actions have to be <em>integrated</em> into the larger context of the game: they need to affect the game experience at some later point in the game. If you move a piece in a game of chess, then that move will directly shape the whole rest of the game, making the moves deeply integrated. But if every game of chess included three opening moves after which the board was reset to the initial position, throwing away everything that happened during those three moves, then those moves would not be integrated to the gameplay. People would just make some moves at random as fast as possible, to get on with the <em>actual</em> opening moves of the game.</p>
<p>As Salen &amp; Zimmerman write: &#8220;Whereas discernability of game events tells players what happened <em>(I hit the monster)</em>, integration lets players know <em>how</em> it will affect the rest of the game <em>(If I keep on hitting the monster I will kill it. If I kill enough monsters, I’ll gain a level.)</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p>My own model is that regardless of whether we&#8217;re playing a game or living our ordinary lives, our minds will automatically keep looking for actions whose outcomes are discernable and integrated, <em>relative to the current scope of experience.</em></p>
<p>When the scope is close, it is easy to find such actions. Taking a shower, making a cup of tea, going out for a jog; the consequences of these actions will manifest as concrete and enjoyable bodily sensations, clearly discernable both within the temporal and spatial scope. And because the scope is so close, almost everything I do will affect the whole scope, so it will feel tightly integrated.  I imagine getting a taste of tea, and think no farther out in time; thus, getting up from bed, going to the kitchen, preparing the tea, and sitting down to drink it, feels like a tight chain of actions where each step gives rise to the next, culminating in the warmth of the tea cup pressing against my lips, the sensation of taste on my tongue.</p>
<p>When the scope is far, it is much different. What action could one even think of, whose consequences were discernable on a scale spanning entire galaxies? Or whose consequences could be traced out for tens, maybe hundreds of years? It&#8217;s hard to imagine anything. An intellectual analysis may suggest things that could plausibly result as a consequence of our actions, but unless one can really visualize those and translate them into emotional terms, it&#8217;s still going to feel hard to connect them to the small-scale things happening in our daily lives.</p>
<p>I find that my mind will automatically look for objectives that makes sense within a given scope. When my scope is relatively close, things like finding a romantic partner and maybe having children feel strongly appealing; they would have a strong impact within the entire scope. When my scope gets more remote, such things seem to lose their appeal: what is one more family going to matter? It is highly unlikely to change the course of history. Better to ignore those things, as my chances to make a lasting impact are remote already; better to concentrate on finding something that would inch those chances ever-so-slightly upwards.</p>
<hr />
<p>The naive implication of this would be, &#8220;keep your scopes close, and you&#8217;ll be happy&#8221;. But of course, it&#8217;s not that simple.</p>
<p>For one, most of us can&#8217;t just focus on small pleasures and not worry at all about things like earning an income, what we&#8217;ll be doing next year, or whatever it is that we need to think about at work. The necessities of everyday life force us to think long term and in a larger context, which forces us to attend to a broader scope of experience.</p>
<p>Even if we did have the opportunity to keep our scope small, the effect would be to make ourselves happy by ignoring everything else that&#8217;s going on in the world. It&#8217;s easy to be happy, if you can just the ignore the suffering of your neighbor; a small scope easily gets very self-centered. (Of course, a large scope can be centered on the self as well; it&#8217;s just that it&#8217;s big enough <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Xuenay/posts/10156563507878662"">to also contain other beings</a>, regardless of who happens to be in the center.)</p>
<p>Even if you widen your scope to contain family and friends, that scope will only contain a small fraction of everybody who exists. You don&#8217;t necessarily want to only think about what happens to those you personally have reason to care about, if it means neglecting the well-being of everyone else.</p>
<p>Of course, it also makes no sense to burden yourself with things that you realistically can&#8217;t affect. Better to exclude those from your scope.</p>
<p>Except&#8230; how certain are you of not being able to affect them? The only thing that <em>guarantees</em> that you can&#8217;t knowingly affect somebody, is if you make the decision to never think about them. If you do keep them in your scope, even only occasionally, then you might come up with something that lets you help them after all.</p>
<p>So the right thing is not to stick with a certain scope, but to learn to adjust the scope if needed. Draw it closer when you are feeling overwhelmed, or when you are at risk of neglecting yourself or your loved ones; broaden it out when you have the resources to deal with the larger scope, and its demands. When you are operating in a larger scope, see if you can find ways to visualize your impact in a way that makes your current actions feel more integrated to the whole context, so as to experience their meaningfulness.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easier said than done.</p>
<p><em>Exercise: see if you can consciously manipulate the scope of your experience. Try pulling it close, both spatially and temporally: focus only on your immediate surroundings and let your attention be drawn to things that you could be doing right away. Then try gradually expanding the scope, maybe all the way up to the level of galaxies and multiverses and millions of years, but also stopping at more intermediate points: e.g. your own life in a few years, or your country or your planet in the same time. How do those changes make a difference to what you feel, and what you feel like doing? </em></p>",Kaj_Sotala,kaj_sotala,Kaj_Sotala,

<p>IE, <em>evidentially</em> conditioning on the chosen action, we should still find that if we <em>causally</em> evaluate different actions, we make the same choice. (My notation of this continues to be rather awkward, sorry.) This is supposed to combine the advantages of CDT and EDT, since we make maximal use of the information revealed by our choice of action, but avoid confusing evidence with influence in doing so.</p>
<p>Really, I should have instead said that the chosen action must be <em>among</em> the maximal choices, so that tie-breaking behavior doesn't matter.</p>
<p>This constraint may be satisfied by several actions; I referred to this as a challenge of ""choosing an equilibrium"" by analogy to game-theoretic equilibria. I neglected to consider that it may also be satisfied by <em>no</em> actions.</p>
<h2>Choosing Between Multiple Options</h2>
<p>I mentioned a concern that choosing between equilibria using expected value might sometimes select equilibria which hide information in order to look better. This doesn't actually happen in any of the examples I discussed, because being consistent with CDT-style choice prevents the information-hiding actions from being equilibria. However, we can easily make an example where it does happen. In the suicidal smoking lesion problem, we might <em>additionally</em> stipulate that the smoke-lovers intrinsically prefer to be non-smoke-lovers, placing -1000 utility on smoke-loving. Then, an equilibrium which leaves a significant chance of not being a smoke-lover looks much better in expected value. So, this method of equilibrium selection would choose the equilibrium where the agent doesn't smoke (and CDT doesn't know enough to switch to smoking, since it looks possible that the agent could smoke and not die).</p>
<p>This makes the solution seem clear to me: we require CDT at a higher level. The error is in choosing equilibria as if the modification of information states actually modified our attributes; but, alas, the self-hating smoke-lover is a smoke-lover whether they smoke or not.</p>
<p>Choosing equilibria via CDT just means selecting an action by CDT, out of those actions which could be equilibria. A question arises as to what information state we choose from. We can again make the argument that we need to choose ""using all information"" (including an evidential update on which equilibrium is chosen), bringing back the question of equilibrium selection in full force. But, this adds no information. Apparently there is no good answer to the equilibrium-selection problem, except that it is equivalent to the action-selection problem, which we solve by choosing from within some equilibrium.</p>
<p>In any case, this line of thinking made me realize that my ""CEDT"" is just the ratifiability condition. Ratifiability was first introduced by Jeffrey in <em>The Logic of Decision</em>. Skyrms showed in <a href=""http://www.joelvelasco.net/teaching/5330/skyrms90-ratifiability_LOD.pdf"">Ratifiability and the Logic of Decision</a> that a reasonable interpretation of ratifiability (perhaps the only reasonable interpretation) makes Jeffrey's EDT select actions which are CDT-optimal when CDT chooses via a probability distribution which has been updated on knowledge of which action is to be selected.</p>
<p>We might imagine, as Skyrms imagined, that the selection of equilibrium proceeds via some kind of convergent process which starts at a knowledge state which is ignorant of the final choice, and ends up in a knowledge state which is in equilibrium. Skyrms raises interesting issues of the Dutch-bookability of such a process.</p>
<h2>Choosing in Absence of Equilibria</h2>
<p>On the other hand, there are some decision problems which lack ratifiable choices. One example is matching pennies, in the case that we expect the opponent has some skill in predicting us. If we update on taking either action, CDT then wishes to take the opposite one.</p>
<p>Now, I don't mean for my opinion on the EDT vs CDT debate to solve all problems correctly; I still think something like updatelessness is required. But, it does seem like we can naturally extend the spirit of ratifiability to get the right answer in these cases.</p>
<p>Rather than choosing pure actions, we choose mixed strategies, and then pick randomly with the equilibrium probabilities. This guarantees the existence of equilibria, as usual in game theory, since the best-response function is a Kakutani function of the probabilities. This gives the expected solution, choosing randomly with 50-50 odds, in matching pennies.</p>
<p>This might seem to violate the original idea -- aren't we supposed to evidentially condition on the <em>actual output of our decision process</em>, ie, the action we take? Aren't we failing to make use of all the information available to us, if we don't? In <a href=""https://myelms.umd.edu/courses/1057200/files/32430443/download?download_frd=1"">Regret and Instability in Causal Decision Theory</a>, James Joyce argues in favor of mixed equilibria like this, partly on the basis of making a distinction between what CDT requires you to <em>believe</em> vs what CDT requires you to <em>do</em>. (He favors a view in which CDT was always intended to yield equilibria like this, and anything else just isn't CDT.)</p>
<h2>Conditions for CDT=EDT</h2>
<p>The main point in favor of mixed equilibria is that the stronger version requiring full knowledge of actions would be inconsistent, since ratifiable actions don't always exist. However, I think there may be something of deeper importance in Joyce's way of thinking. The ""decision"", as such, is the formation of the epistemic state about the action; it is this which is required to be in equilibrium. The <em>action</em> occurs after the decision, and may be anything which is consistent with the decision.</p>
<p>To see why this may be important, let's try to put the same self-knowledge condition on EDT. Suppose we are using a version of EDT which epsilon-explores. However, we impose the requirement that EDT's prior knows what policy EDT selects -- IE, it knows what it will do up to the randomness involved in exploration. EDT can still condition on alternate actions, thanks to the epsilon probability remaining for alternate actions. However, knowing its own policy in this way will remove most of the correlations which allow it to make EDT-like decisions. It won't cooperate with a copy of itself in Prisoner's Dilemma if the copy uses different random bits; it knows the policy which the copy will use, and all remaining wiggle room is in randomness, so it no longer sees its action as correlated with the other player's. It will two-box in a version of Newcomb's problem where Omega can't predict the random bits. And so on.</p>
<p>Roughly speaking, we've conditioned on the ""output of my decision algorithm"" node in the causal graph, which was the hidden parent making CDT different from EDT.</p>
<p>This shouldn't be <em>too</em> surprising, given the history of the ratifiability condition. Although I was invoking ratifiability to get CDT to do the right thing in cases where EDT seemed to be doing better, Jeffrey <em>originally</em> proposed ratifiability as a corrective measure for making <em>EDT</em> act like <em>CDT</em> in the cases where they disagreed.</p>
<p>However, this does not always make CDT=EDT. If your exploration bits can be predicted, then EDT and CDT still advise different actions. The ""hard mode"" of matching pennies is Death in Damascus: Death can predict your every move, so exploration or no, you meet your demise. Under the ratifiable equilibrium, CDT still proposes to flee half the time (as if frantically randomizing in the hope that Death will fail). EDT doesn't do this. In Newcomb with a perfect predictor, CDT two-boxes and EDT one-boxes. And so on. (Note that we still need to make EDT epsilon-explore in these cases, in order to keep the EDT conditional expected utilities well-defined.)</p>
<p>This leads me to propose the following rule for agents obeying ratifiability:</p>
<p><strong>Law of Logical Causality</strong>: <em>If conditioning on any event changes the probability an agent assigns to its own action, that event <strong>must</strong> be treated as causally downstream.</em></p>
<p>This is still a bit rough, but constraints on the structure of counterfactuals are hard to come by, so I'll take what I can get.</p>
<p>For example, this means that you must treat Death as causally downstream of your decision in Death in Damascus. You must treat Omega as causally downstream of you in the perfect-predictor version of Newcomb. And so on.</p>
<p>It does <em>not</em> mean that you must treat <em>all</em> things correlated with your decision as downstream. In Smoking Lesion Steelman, the lesion is still upstream of your decision. The Law of Logical Causality does not touch it, because an agent obeying ratifiability will know its own decision perfectly, screening off the action from such influences. But, this depends on my special version of Smoking Lesion. Perhaps in a different version of Smoking Lesion, where the increased tendency to smoke is more like a trembling hand after the decision is made, the influence is downstream rather than upstream.</p>
<p>Hence the title of this post. Ratifiability, the very tool which CDT advocates used to fend off a series of counterexamples (including cases like Murder Lesion and the suicidal smoking lesion), can be taken by EDT advocates and turned into a very strong version of the tickle defense. This strong version of the tickle defense makes EDT act as CDT advises in all but the most extreme cases, where predictors are perfect. From this, we propose a constraint on the causal graphs which would make CDT do as EDT would advise.</p>
<p>The whole structure is far from watertight, and is badly in need of formalization. However, it feels like progress to me.</p>

Repost from LW]</em></p><p><em>[This section goes over 4 concepts that I think are important to keep in mind before we start the other stuff. We go over caring about the obvious, looking for ways to apply advice in the real world, practicing well, and holding realistic expectations.]</em></p><h2><strong>In Defense of the Obvious:</strong></h2><p><em>[As advertised.]</em></p><p>A lot of the things I’m going to go over in this sequence are sometimes going to sound obvious, boring, redundant, or downright tautological. I’m here to convince you that you should try to listen to such advice anyway, even if it sounds stupidly obvious.</p><p>First off, our brains don’t always see all the connections at once. Thus, even if some given advice is <em>apparently</em> obvious, you still might be learning new things.</p><p>For example, say I told you, “If you want to exercise more, then you should probably exercise more. Once you do that, you’ll become the type of person who exercises more, and then you’ll likely exercise more.”</p><p>The above advice might sound pretty silly, but keep in mind that our mental categories for “exercise” and “personal identity” might be in different places. Sure, it’s tautologically true that someone who exercises becomes a person who exercises more. But if you’re not explicitly thinking in terms of how your actions change who you are, which is what the tautology is pointing at, then you’ve still learned something new.</p><p>Humans are often weirdly inconsistent with our mental buckets—things that logically seem like they “should” be lumped together by logical implication often aren’t. </p><p>By paying attention to even tautological advice like this, you’re able to form new connections in your brain and link new mental categories together, perhaps discovering new insights that you “already knew”.</p><p>Secondly, obvious advice is often used as a label for what everyone know works. If your brain is pattern-matching something as “boring advice” or “obvious”, you’ve likely heard it before many times before.</p><p>For example, you can probably guess the top 5 things on any “How to be Productive” list—make a schedule, remove distractions, take breaks, etc. etc. You can almost feel your brain roll its metaphorical eyes at such dreary, well-worn advice.</p><p>But if you’ve heard these things repeated many times before, this is also good reason to suspect that, at least for a lot of people, it actually works. Meaning that if you aren’t taking such advice already, you can probably get a boost by doing so.</p><p>If you just did those top 5 things, you’d probably already be quite the productive person. </p><p>The trick, then, is <em>actually doing</em> them.</p><p>Lastly, it can be easy to discount obvious advice when you’ve seen too much of it. When you’re bombarded with boring-seeming advice from all angles, it’s easy to become <em>desensitized</em>.</p><p>What I mean is that it’s possible to dismiss obvious advice outright because it sounds way too simple. “This can’t possibly work,” your brain might say, “the secret to getting things done must be more complex than that!”</p><p>In philosophy, there’s this idea of a “hedonic treadmill”, an idea based off our human inclination to compare experiences <em>relatively</em>.  For example, if you have something tasty, like a chocolate bar, then you’ll need something even tastier the next time, like a tiramisu cake. A more stereotypical example might be a drug user seeking out an even stronger high for their second experience. </p><p>The point is that, as you are exposed to more and more pleasures, you find yourself on a treadmill climb to seek out ever more delicious experiences (because, by comparison, everything else will seem dull). </p><p>There’s something akin to the hedonic treadmill happening here where, after having been exposed to all the “normal” advice, you start to seek out deeper and deeper ideas in search of some sort of mental high. What happens is that you become a kind of self-help junkie.</p><p>As a self-help junkie, you end up adopting quite the contrarian stance—you reject the typical idea of advice on grounds of its obviousness alone. There’s a certain aesthetic to being the cool kid who knows that simple advice isn’t enough to solve their complex, multi-faceted problems.</p><p>You can end up craving the bleeding edge of crazy ideas because literally nothing else seems worthwhile. You might end up dismissing obvious helpful ideas simply because they’re not paradigm-crushing, mind-blowing, or mentally <em>stimulating</em> enough.</p><p>If this describes, might I tempt you with the meta-contrarian point of view?</p><p>Here’s this for a crazy idea: One of the secrets to winning at life is looking at obvious advice, acknowledging that it’s obvious, and then doing it anyway. </p><p>(That’s right, you can join the even cooler group of kids who scoff at those who scoff at the obvious!)</p><p>You can both say, “Hey, this is pretty simple stuff I’ve heard a thousand times before,” as well as say, “Hey, this is pretty useful stuff I should shut up and do anyway even if it sounds simple because I’m smart and I recognize the value here.”</p><p>At some point, being more sophisticated than the sophisticates means being able the grasp the idea that not all things have to be hyper complex. Oftentimes, the trick to getting something done is simply to get started. </p><p>Because some things in life really <em>are</em> obvious.</p><p style=""text-align:center;"">++++</p><h2 style=""text-align:left;""><strong>Hunting for Practicality:</strong></h2><p style=""text-align:left;""><em>[This is about looking for ways to have any advice you read be actually useful, by having it apply to the real world. ]</em></p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Imagine someone trying to explain exactly what the mitochondria does in the cell, and contrast that to someone trying to score points in a game of basketball. </p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Someone could take classes to learn how to get better at each of those two things.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Yet, there’s something clearly different about what each person is trying to do, even if we lumped both under the label of “learning”. </p><p style=""text-align:left;"">It turns out there are roughly two types of knowledge you can learn: <strong>declarative</strong> and <strong>procedural</strong> knowledge. </p><p style=""text-align:left;""><strong>Declarative knowledge</strong> is like the student trying to puzzle out the mitochondria question; it’s about what you <em>know</em>. It’s about how your concepts link to one another, like how you can know that Paris is the capital city of France, or that it takes about 20 minutes to walk a mile.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">In contrast, <strong>procedural knowledge</strong>, like the fledgling basketball player, is about what you <em>do</em>. It’s about how you actually carry out certain actions, like how you learn to throw a frisbee well, or how to ride a bike.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">I bring up this divide because many of the techniques in instrumental rationality will feel like declarative knowledge, but they’ll actually be much more procedural in nature.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">For example, say you’re reading an essay on motivation, and you read about how “Motivation = Energy to do the thing + a Reminder to do the thing + Time to do the thing = E+R+T”. </p><p style=""text-align:left;"">What’ll likely happen is that your brain will form a new set of mental nodes that connects “motivation” to “E+R+T”. This would be great if I ended up quizzing you “What does motivation equal?” whereupon you’d correctly answer “E+R+T”. </p><p style=""text-align:left;"">But that’s not the point here! </p><p style=""text-align:left;"">The point is to have the equation actually cash out into the real world and positively affect your actions. If information isn’t changing you view or act, then you’re probably not extracting all the value you can.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">What that often means is figuring out the answer to this question: </p><h4 style=""text-align:left;""><strong>“How do I see myself taking different actions as a result of having learned this information?” </strong></h4><p style=""text-align:left;"">With that in mind, maybe you generate some examples and make a list in response to the question.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Your list of real-world actions might end up looking like:</p><ol><li><p>Remembering to stay hydrated more often (Energy)</p></li><li><p>Using more Post-It notes as memos (Reminder)</p></li><li><p>Start using Google Calendar to block out chunks of time (Time).</p></li></ol><p>The point is to be always on the lookout for ways to see how you can use what you’re learning to inform your actions. Learning about all these things is only useful if you can find ways to apply them.</p><p>As we go forward, I’ll try to give concrete and useful examples for all the ideas we go over, but you want to find ways to move past the simple pattern-matching. You want to do more than have empty boxes that link concepts together. It’s important to have those boxes linked up to ways you can do better in the real world.</p><p>You want to actually put in some effort trying to answer question of practicality.</p><p>Knowledge might be power, but you also often need to act on it.</p><p style=""text-align:center;"">++++</p><h2 style=""text-align:left;""><strong>Actually Practicing:</strong></h2><p style=""text-align:left;""><em>[This is about knowing the nuances of little steps behind any sort of self-improvement skill you learn, and how those little steps are important when learning the whole.]</em></p><p style=""text-align:left;"">So on one level, using knowledge from instrumental rationality is about how you take declarative-seeming information and find ways to utilize it in real world actions.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">That’s definitely important.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Another thing, though, is to note that the very skill of “Generating Examples”—the thing you did in the above essay to even figure out which actions can fit in the above equation to fill in the blanks of E, R, and T—is itself a mental habit that requires procedural knowledge.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">What I mean is that there’s a subtler thing that’s happening inside your head when you try to come up with examples—your brain is doing <em>something</em>—and this “something” is important.  </p><p style=""text-align:left;"">It’s important, I claim, because if we peer a little more deeply at what it means for your brain to generate examples, we’ll come away with a list of steps that will feel a lot like something a brain can do, a prime example of procedural knowledge.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">For example, we can imagine a magician trying to learn a card trick. They go through the steps. First they need to spread the cards. Then comes the secret move. Finally comes the magical reveal of the selected card in the magician’s pocket. </p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Even though the audience experiences the whole trick as one magical unit, the magician knows that it’s really made up of all those little steps.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Likewise, we can apply the same analogy to things we’ll learn in instrumental rationality, to the mental habits we’ll go over.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">If we spent some time really looking at the little steps of coming up with examples, we could describe it in detail. The skill of Generating Examples, with a reductionist view, might look something like this:</p><h4 style=""text-align:left;""><strong>Technique: Generating Examples</strong></h4><ol><li><p><strong>Imagine the “skeleton” of the concept you are trying to fit an example to.<br/></strong>EX: Anne is trying to come up with an example of what is a System 1 process. She knows it’s about fast and sometimes mistaken thinking, so she uses that as the “frame” to search for examples.</p></li><li><p><strong>Look for things in your everyday life that fit.<br/></strong>EX: Anne thinks about things in her daily routine which don’t require much thought. “Maybe brushing my teeth?” she wonders.</p></li><li><p><strong>Think about books, movies, or other pop culture if real life doesn’t prove fruitful.<br/></strong>EX: Anne thinks about a movie about a character who always gets into trouble because of their quick wit and fast tongue. “Hmm, maybe also the sort of social responses we give count as S1 responses?” she thinks.</p></li></ol><p style=""text-align:center;"">++++</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">The idea here is to describe any mental skill with enough granularity and detail, at the <a href=""https://www.lesserwrong.com/posts/JcpzFpPBSmzuksmWM/the-5-second-level"">5 second level. </a>What I mean by that is that you should be able to describe such that you’d both be able to go through the same steps a second time and teach someone else.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">That means having a very deep understanding of exactly what little steps you’re going through in your head to produce the skill.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Now of course most of us already know how to generate examples, so the above “technique” formulation might seem a little alien, as it’s already something we do without much explicit, conscious input. </p><p style=""text-align:left;"">However, when we move on to more novel and complex habits of mind, techniques that involve moving your brain in new ways, then having a good understanding that these steps are things you do becomes quite important. </p><p style=""text-align:left;"">A basketball player doesn’t strongly improve just by watching the NBA. Likewise, figuring out this instrumental rationality stuff is not a spectator sport either. You need to really go through the mental motions in your own head and act on them.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">This is what I mean when I say that mental habits are procedural. </p><p style=""text-align:left;"">In addition to figuring out the practicality and the little pieces, it’s important to find opportunities to use these different skills.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">You can’t get better at doing something unless you, y’know, actually do it.</p><p style=""text-align:center;"">++++</p><h2 style=""text-align:left;""><strong>Realistic Expectations:</strong></h2><p style=""text-align:left;""><em>[An essay about having realistic expectations and looking past potentially harmful framing effects.]</em></p><p style=""text-align:left;"">There’s this tendency to get frustrated with learning mental techniques after just a few days. I think this is because people miss the declarative vs procedural distinction. </p><p style=""text-align:left;"">(But you hopefully won’t fall prey to it because we’ve covered the distinction now.)</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Once we liken the analogy to be more like that playing a sport, it becomes much easier to see that any expectation of immediately learning a mental habit is rather silly—after all, no one expects to master tennis in just a week.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">So, when it comes to trying to configure your expectations, I suggest that you try to <em>renormalize</em> your expectations by treating learning mental habits more like learning a sport. </p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Keep that as an analogy, and you’ll likely get fairly well-calibrated expectations for learning all this stuff.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Still, what, then, might be a realistic time frame for learning? </p><p style=""text-align:left;"">We’ll go over habits in far more detail in a later section, but a rough number for now is approximately two months. You can expect that, on average, it’ll take you about 66 days to ingrain a new habit.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">(There’ll be a lot more on habits in Part 4.)</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Similarly, instrumental rationality (probably) won’t make you a god. </p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Disappointing, I know.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Still, in my experience, studying these areas has been super useful, which is why I’m writing this at all. Your own mileage will vary depending where you are right now, but this serves as the general disclaimer to keep your expectations within the bound of reality.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Here, the main point is that, even though mental habits don’t seem like they should be more similar to playing a sport, they really are. There’s something here about how first impressions can be rather deceiving.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">For example, a typical trap I sometimes fall into is missing the distinction between “theoretically possible” and “realistic”. </p><p style=""text-align:left;"">I end up looking at the supposed 24 hours available to me everyday and then beating myself up for not being able to harness all 24 hours to do productive work. “After all,” my brain says, “that’s all time you could be using to do things!”</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">But such a framing of the situation is inaccurate; things like sleep and eating are often very essential to maximizing productivity for the rest of the hours! Just because it looks like I could “in theory” get additional work time, self-care is also an important factor that we easily miss!</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">So when diving in and practicing, try to look a little deeper when setting your expectations. Bias towards pessimism. No one likes to hear it, but the chances of you actually turning your life around at any given moment are likely slim.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">That’s just how things work. Disappointing, for sure, but that’s all the more reason to be suspicious if you’ve got too rosy expectations of how things will turn out.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">First glances tend to be deceiving.</p><p style=""text-align:center;"">++++</p><h2 style=""text-align:center;""><a href=""https://www.lesserwrong.com/posts/53pxcve5kgwoLFvzD/instrumental-rationality-2-planning-101""><strong>Next essay</strong></a></h2></div></div></div></div>",,,,

A <a href=""https://foundational-research.org/the-importance-of-wild-animal-suffering/#More_Offspring_Than_Survive"">really simple form of the argument</a>, supported by people like Brian Tomasik, is what one might call the argument from life history. In general, in most species, females produce many more offspring than can survive to adulthood; in some cases, a female may produce thousands or millions of offspring in a single reproductive season. Therefore, one can assume that most animals die before they are able to reproduce. In many cases, the offspring die before they can reasonably be considered conscious (for instance, an egg is eaten shortly after laying). However, even if half of animals die unconscious, the other half are a large source of disutility. Since death is generally quite painful, they may not have had enough positive experiences to outweigh the extraordinarily negative experience of death. It can therefore be assumed that there is more suffering than happiness in nature.</p><p>While this argument is intuitively compelling, I am not sure that it accurately reflects most people’s opinions about how happiness works, so I have decided to write up three thought experiments that might help people think about it. These thought experiments are quite preliminary; I hope to spark a discussion so that people who are concerned about wild-animal suffering can debate.</p><p>1. The Human History Thought Experiment</p><p>Although the human population has been growing for thousands of years, for most of history <a href=""https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-growth/#long-run-historical-perspective"">the growth was fairly slow</a>, suggesting the argument from life history applies to us as well. In part, that was because many humans died in childhood: for example, in 1800<a href=""https://ourworldindata.org/child-mortality/""> four-tenths of humans died before they were five years old</a>, <a href=""https://ourworldindata.org/child-mortality/#infant-mortality"">a quarter of humans before their first birthday</a>. (Note that 1800 is fairly late, and the statistics may have been even more stark in, say, 1 CE.)</p><p>I do not mean to deny that pre-modern human life was miserable in many ways: people were hungry, diseased, and poor. And I certainly don’t mean to claim that high child mortality rates weren’t a tragedy. However, my intuition is that-- whether or not human lives were worth living before modernity-- the high child mortality rate does not single-handedly prove that human lives were not worth living. Other information must be gathered to prove that. I suspect many other people’s intuitions will agree.</p><p>To the extent the human history argument is misleading or anthropomorphizing, it strengthens my point: for instance, humans grieve their infants, while fish do not, so high infant mortality rates are worse for humans than for fish.</p><p>2. The Babykillers Thought Experiment</p><p>Humans have relatively few children and are growing (albeit slowly), perhaps suggesting that they are misleading as a thought experiment. Consider, therefore, a sapient species of aliens, the Babykillers. This species lays a thousand live young at a time. The young devour each other and only the single strongest offspring survives. All of the non-surviving thousand have miserable lives: they are tremendously hungry until they are eaten alive. The Babykillers have no way of modifying themselves to lay only a single offspring. To set aside issues of the Babykillers being replaced by humans, assume that Babykillers are not aware of any other species. Would it be ethically required to have a Voluntary Babykiller Extinction Movement?</p><p>Personally, I put some weight on the argument that diversity is intrinsically valuable and therefore it is harmful to eliminate a sapient species. Otherwise, my moral intuitions are conflicted about whether Babykillers are net-negative and should be extinct.</p><p>3. The Long-Lived Babykillers Thought Experiment</p><p>The Babykillers are a species as specified above, except that the Babykillers are also extraordinarily long-lived: the average Babykiller who survives infancy lives for a thousand years. The average Babykiller who is eaten lives for only an hour. Babykillers are also a happy and fulfilled species. Therefore, while 999/1000 Babykillers experience a short life of great hunger followed by a painful death, only about one in ten thousand hours experienced by a Babykiller consists of great hunger and a painful death. The rest are quite happy.</p><p>The Long-Lived Babykiller thought experiment is supposed to get at an alternate method of assessing well-being. Instead of thinking about whether the average member of a species has a life worth living, we instead think about whether the average hour experienced by a member of a species is worth experiencing. For species with high juvenile mortality and/or long lives, these may be very different metrics.</p><p>Intuitively, I think the Long-Lived Babykillers should not go extinct. I think that also goes along with my intuitions about the human case. Since humans are fairly long-lived, a relatively small percentage of human hours are spent being a sick infant. I’m also tempted by the practical benefits. You could, in theory, figure out whether an animal species’s existence is net positive simply by randomly sampling animals (although of course seasonal changes such as winter starvation or mating seasons would make this more complicated). However, many people have <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prioritarianism"">prioritarian</a> intuitions. In that case, the experiences of animals who die young and painfully should be given more weight than the experiences of happy animals.</p><p>To be clear, I’m not necessarily satisfied by the “average hour” criterion. I do think we haven’t put enough philosophical work into understanding what makes a species’s existence net positive or net negative, and I hope my thought experiments will prompt some thought about the issue.</p></div></div></div></div>",ozymandias,ozymandias,ozymandias,

<p><strong>edit 2019-06-25</strong>: <em>this post is tone-deaf about ways people who experience the more common and dramatically stronger silencing forces of prejudice would see it.

<p>I often find that I filter my urges to give feedback, especially negative feedback, in public.</p>
<p>For example, when downvoting someone, I often feel an urge to say why. But then I hesitate because I worry that they will feel insulted, and attack me for my trouble of explaining myself.</p>
<p>This fear is not unfounded. sometimes when I say why, people do in fact challenge it.</p>
<p>But if I was on a discussion board with a bunch of slightly different myselves, and I never gave the other mes feedback, I would never get any feedback from them.</p>
<p>So, some semi-random fraction of the time, I say the thing anyway, in a short message with little overhead for me. I'm taking some risk, because then I say things that might get me in a fight. But people get more detailed feedback, instead of simply being ghosted or downvoted away because I'm scared of the fact that it's unsafe for me to be straight with them.</p>
<p>So when I say I'm ""de-silencing"" myself - this is what I mean.</p>
<p>I call it ""de-silencing"" because I do it to break the attractors that silencing forces on me create. Some non-negligible portion of the time, those forces do specifically intend to silence people. And this technique would not work if someone was specifically out to get me.</p>

Let Rl and Rs be two simple reward functions at each turn. The reward Rl is thought of as being a ‘long-term’ reward, while Rs is a short-term one.</p><p>Define Rl(t) as the agent’s Rl reward at turn t (and similarly Rs(t) for Rs). Then, at turn t, the agent <strong>H</strong> has reward:</p><ul><li><p>R(t) = (Sum over τ=0 to ∞) [Rl(t+τ)(γl)^τ + Rs(t+τ)(γs)^τ],</p></li></ul><p>with constants 0&lt;γs&lt;γl≤1.</p><p>Essentially the Rs and the Rl have different discount rates, with the reward from Rs fading much faster than than that of Rl. Therefore the agent will be motivated to get the Rs reward, but only if they can get this in the short-term. Sex, drugs, food, and many other pleasures often have these features (though they are, of course, much more complicated).</p><p>The inconsistency is that the human will continually reset their R(t) at each turn. If there were a single discount rate, that wouldn’t a problem, as that would just scale the whole reward function, and reward functions, like utility functions, give the same decisions when scaled.</p><p>But with two discount rates, this is inconsistent. The agent will try and follow Rl for long-term planning, but this will be disrupted if they encounter an Rs along the way (and then presumably berate themselves for the lack of self-discipline). This can also be seen as a variant of the “humans are composed of multiple subagents” model, with Rs corresponding to short-term greedy subagent.</p><p>So, we have a simple and not-completely-implausible model of an inconsistent human. The question is, how do we resolve it? None of the obvious approaches are ideal, but it’s worth looking at their features.</p><h2>Freeze the reward</h2><p>This is the most obvious approach: simply freeze the reward, so that the reward at time t′&gt;t is simply the same as reward at time t (though, in the absence of time-travel, the rewards between t and t′ are no longer relevant).</p><p>This is the obvious approach; in practice, though, it will become equivalent with simply forgetting about Rs entirely. After a few turns, the exponential shrinkage of the factor (γl/γs) will make Rs’s typical contribution insignificant. So this approach involves destroying one of <strong>H</strong>’s sources of reward almost entirely.</p><h2>Balance the rewards</h2><p>Another approach would be to balance the rewards, set γl=γs, either at the initial value of γl, the initial value of γs, or some other value.</p><p>This would make the the reward consistent, but has the opposite problem as the previous approach: the long-term importance of Rs is now massively magnified relative to Rl, so now the long-term plans will prioritise Rs above Rl much more than before.</p><h2>Narrative/frequentist/feature based approach</h2><p>Since we’re not supposed to do this, let’s anthropomorphise <strong>H</strong>. We can imagine that <strong>H</strong> has some sort of narrative about their existence – they see themselves as being a certain type of person (possibly mainly connected with Rl), who has some quirks/indulgences/sins (possibly mainly connected with Rs).</p><p>If they want to extirpate Rs entirely (“sin”), this is the same as the “Freeze the reward” approach. But they may instead prefer to live their life with roughly the same proportion of Rs as before (“quirk”), or slightly less (“indulgence”).</p><p>In that case, the new R would be chosen for consequentialist reasons. Not by looking at the individual terms Rl, Rs, γl, and γs, but by looking at the consequences of following R(t) under “typical” circumstances, and designing the new reward to replicate this behaviour (and this distribution of reward features), while allowing more efficiency. This is, in itself, an interesting IRL problem. But it seems to make sense for humans, as we define ourselves a lot by what we do and experience, rather than by the pleasures and choices that lead up to those experiences.</p><p></p><p>What do people feel about these approaches? If you had this kind of inconsistency in your reward, how would you typically want it to be resolved?</p><p></p></div></div></div></div>",Stuart_Armstrong,stuart_armstrong,Stuart_Armstrong,

Sex, drugs, food, and many other pleasures often have these features (though they are, of course, much more complicated).</p>
<p>The inconsistency is that the human will continually reset their <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""R_t""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">R</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mi"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">t</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> at each turn. If there were a single discount rate, that wouldn't a problem, as that would just scale the whole reward function, and reward functions, like utility functions, give the same decisions when scaled.</p>
<p>But with two discount rates, this is inconsistent. The agent will try and follow <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""R_l""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">R</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.219em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mi"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">l</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> for long-term planning, but this will be disrupted if they encounter an <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""R_s""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">R</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mi"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">s</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> along the way (and then presumably berate themselves for the lack of self-discipline). This can also be seen as a variant of the ""humans are composed of multiple subagents"" model, with <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""R_s""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">R</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mi"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">s</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> corresponding to short-term greedy subagent.</p>
<p>So, we have a simple and not-completely-implausible model of an inconsistent human. The question is, how do we resolve it? None of the obvious approaches are ideal, but it's worth looking at their features.</p>
<h1>Freeze the reward</h1>
<p>This is the most obvious approach: simply freeze the reward, so that the reward at time <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""t'>t""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">t</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sup"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: 0.513em; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mo"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.298em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">′</span></span></span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">&gt;</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">t</span></span></span></span></span></span> is simply the same as reward at time <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""t""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">t</span></span></span></span></span></span> (though, in the absence of time-travel, the rewards between <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""t""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">t</span></span></span></span></span></span> and <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""t'""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">t</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sup"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: 0.513em; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mo"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.298em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">′</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> are no longer relevant).</p>
<p>This is the obvious approach; in practice, though, it will become equivalent with simply forgetting about <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""R_s""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">R</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mi"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">s</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> entirely.

In this (short) article, I hope to challenge that view.</p><p>Emergence is not an empty phrase. The statements &quot;consciousness is an emergent phenomenon&quot; and &quot;consciousness is a phenomenon&quot; are not the same thing; the former conveys information that the latter does not. When we say something is <a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence"">emergent</a>, we have a well defined concept that we refer to.</p><p>From <a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence"">Wikipedia</a>:</p><blockquote><p>emergence is a phenomenon whereby larger entities arise through interactions among smaller or simpler entities such that the larger entities exhibit properties the smaller/simpler entities do not exhibit.</p></blockquote><p>A is an emergent property of X, means that A arises from X in a way in which it is contingent on the interaction of the constituents of X (and not on those constituents themselves). If A is an emergent property of X, then the constituents of X do not possess A. A comes into existence as categorial novum at the inception of X. The difference between system X and its constituent components in regards to property A is a difference of kind and not of degree; X&#x27;s constituents do not possess A in some tiny magnitude—they do not possess A at all.</p><blockquote><p>Taken literally, that description fits every phenomenon in our universe above the level of individual quarks, which is part of the problem</p></blockquote><p>This is blatantly not true; size and mass for example are properties of elementary particles.</p><blockquote><p>You can make no new predictions. You do not know anything about the behavior of real-world minds that you did not know before. It feels like you believe a new fact, but you don&#x27;t anticipate any different outcomes. Your curiosity feels sated, but it has not been fed. The hypothesis has no moving parts—there&#x27;s no detailed internal model to manipulate. Those who proffer the hypothesis of &quot;emergence&quot; confess their ignorance of the internals, and take pride in it; they contrast the science of &quot;emergence&quot; to other sciences merely mundane.</p></blockquote><p>I repectfully disagree.</p><p>When we say A is an emergent property of X, we say that X is more than a sum of its parts. Aggregation and amplification of the properties of X&#x27;s constituents does not produce the properties of X. The proximate cause of A is not the constituents of X themselves—it is the interaction between those constituents.</p><p>Emergence is <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/i8/religions_claim_to_be_nondisprovable/"">testable and falsifiable</a>, emergence makes <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/i3/making_beliefs_pay_rent_in_anticipated_experiences/"">advance predictions</a>; if I say A is an emergent property of system X, then I say that none of the constituent components of system A possess A (in any form or magnitude).</p><p>Statement: &quot;consciousness (in humans) is an emergent property of the brain.&quot;</p><p>Prediction: &quot;individual neurons are not conscious to any degree.&quot;&quot;</p><p>Observing a supposed emergent property in constituent components falsifies the theory of emergence (as far as that theory/phenomenon is concerned).</p><p> </p><p><a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/if/your_strength_as_a_rationalist/"">The strength of a theory is </a><a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/ii/conservation_of_expected_evidence/"">not what it can predict, but what it can&#x27;t.</a> Emergence excludes a lot of things; size and mass are not emergent properties of atoms (elementary physical paticles possess both of them). Any property that the constituents of X possess (even to an astronomically lesser degree) is not emergent. This excludes a whole lot of properties; size, mass, density, electrical charge, etc. In fact, based on my (virtually non-existent knowledge of physics), I suspect that all fundamental and derived quantities are not emergent properties (I once again reiterate that I don&#x27;t know physics).</p><p> </p><p>Emergence does not function as a <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/it/semantic_stopsigns/"">semantic stopsign</a> or <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/j3/science_as_curiositystopper/"">curiosity stopper </a>for me. When I say consciousness is emergent, I have provided a skeletal explanation (at the highest abstract levels) of the mechanism of consicousness. I have narrowed my search; I now know that consciousness is not a property of neurons, but arises from the interaction thereof. To use an analogy that I am (somewhat) familiar with, saying a property is emergent, is like saying an algorithm is recursive; we are providing a high level abstract description of both the phenomena and the algorithm. We are conveying (non-trivial) information about both phenomena and algorithm. In the former case, we convey that the property arises as a result of the interaction of the constituent components of a system (and is not reducible to the properties of those constituents). In the latter case, we specify that the algorithm operates by taking as input the output of the algorithm for other instances of the problem (operating on itself). When we say a phenomenon is an emergent property of a system, it is analogous to saying that an algorithm is recursive; you do not have enough information to construct either phenomena or algorithm, but you now know more about both than you did before, and the knowledge you have gained is non-trivial.</p><blockquote><p>Before: Human intelligence is an emergent product of neurons firing. After: Human intelligence is a product of neurons firing.</p></blockquote><p>How about this:</p><p><u>Before:</u> &quot;The quicksort algorithm is a recursive algorithm.&quot;</p><p><u>After:</u> &quot;The quicksort algorithm is an algorithm.&quot;</p><blockquote><p>Before: Human intelligence is an emergent product of neurons firing. </p></blockquote><blockquote><p>After: Human intelligence is a magical product of neurons firing.</p></blockquote><p>Thi s seems to work just as fine:</p><p><u>Before:</u> &quot;The quicksort algorithm is a recursive algorithm.&quot;</p><p><u>After:</u> &quot;The quicksort algorithm is a magical algorithm.&quot;</p><blockquote><p>Does not each statement convey exactly the same amount of knowledge about the phenomenon&#x27;s behavior? Does not each hypothesis <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/if/your_strength_as_a_rationalist/"">fit exactly the same set of outcomes</a>?</p></blockquote><p>It seems clear to me that in both cases, the original statement conveys more information than the edited version. I argue that this is the same for &quot;emergence&quot;; saying a phenomenon is an emergent property does convey useful non-trivial information about that phenomenon.</p><p> </p><p>I shall answer the below question:</p><blockquote><p>If I showed you two conscious beings, one which achieved consciousness through emergence and one that did not, would you be able to tell them apart?</p></blockquote><p>Yes. For the being which achieved consciousness through means other than emergence, I know that the constituents of that being are conscious.</p><p>Emergent consciousness: A human brain.</p><p>Non-emergent consciousness: A hive mind.</p><p>The constituents of the hive mind are by themselves conscious, and I think that&#x27;s a useful distinction.  </p><blockquote><p>&quot;Emergence&quot; has become very popular, just as saying &quot;magic&quot; used to be very popular. &quot;Emergence&quot; has the same deep appeal to human psychology, for the same reason. &quot;Emergence&quot; is such a wonderfully easy explanation, and it feels good to say it; it gives you a <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/iu/mysterious_answers_to_mysterious_questions/"">sacred mystery</a> to worship. Emergence is popular because it is the junk food of curiosity. You can explain anything using emergence, and so people do just that; for it feels so wonderful to explain things. Humans are still humans, even if they&#x27;ve taken a few science classes in college. Once they find a way to escape the <a href=""http://yudkowsky.net/rational/virtues/"">shackles</a> of settled science, they get up to the same shenanigans as their ancestors, <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/i7/belief_as_attire/"">dressed up in the literary genre of &quot;science&quot; but still the same species psychology</a>.</p></blockquote><p>Once again, I disagree with Eliezer. Describing a phenomenon as emergent is (for me) equivalent to describing an algorithm as recursive; merely providing relevant characterisation to distinguish the subject (phenomenon/algorithm) from other subjects. Emergence is nothing magical to me; when I say consciousness is emergent, I carry no illusions that I now understand consciousness, my curiosity is not sated—but I argue—I am now more knowledgebale than I was before; I now have an abstract conception of the mechanism of consciousness; it is very limited, but it is better than nothing. Telling you quicksort is recursive doesn&#x27;t tell you how to implement quicksort, but it does (significantly) constrain your search space; If you were going to run a brute force search of algorithm design space to find quicksort, you now know to confine your search to recursive algorithms. Telling you that quicksort is recursive, brings you closer to understanding quicksort than if you were told it&#x27;s just an algorithm. The same is true for saying consciousness is emergent. You know understand more on consciousness than you did before; you now know that it arises categorial novum as a consequence of the interaction of neurons. Describing a phenomenon as &quot;emergent&quot; does not convey zero information, and thus I argue the category is necessary. Emergent is only as futile an explanation as recursion is.</p><p> </p><p>Now that I have (hopefully) established that emergence is a real theory (albeit one with limited explanation power, not unlike describing an algorithm as recursive), I would like to add something else. The above is a defence of the legitimacy of emergence as a theory; I am not of necessity saying that emergence is correct. It may be the case that no property of any system is emergent, and as such all properties of systems are properties of at least one of its constituent components. The question of whether emergence is correct (there exists at least one property of at least one system that is not a property of any of its constituent components (not necessarily consciousness/intelligence)) is an entirely different question, and is neither the thesis of this write up, nor a question I am currently equipped to tackle. If it is of any relevance, I do believe consciousness is at least a (weakly) emergent property of sapient animal brains.</p><p>Part of The Contrarian Sequences</p><p> </p></div></div></div></div>",DragonGod,dragongod,DragonGod,

Solicited feedback. Checked my last few posts&#x27; comment count to make sure I wasn&#x27;t *</em>obviously*<em> wrong.</em></p><p>A thing that happens to me, and perhaps to you:</p><p>Someone writes a beautiful essay that I agree with, that sheds new light on something important.</p><p>I don&#x27;t have anything really to say about it. I don&#x27;t want to just say &quot;I agree!&quot;. So instead of commenting, I give it an upvote and move on.</p><p>This feels bad for a few reasons:</p><ul><li>I like commenting.</li><li>I like <em>getting </em>comments when I write things that (I hope!) are insightful, beautiful and true. It&#x27;s a stronger signal that people care. </li><li>Comments correlate with something <em>staying in the public sphere of attention</em>. A highly upvoted post eventually fades behind newer upvoted posts. But a post with lots of comments keeps people paying attention (with new people constantly checking in to see what the hubbub is about)</li><li>I don&#x27;t trust (as a reader or a writer) that people who read a post, give it an upvote, and move on, are really <em>learning</em> anything. I think that talking through an a new concept and figuring out how to apply is where much of the learning happens.</li></ul><p>I&#x27;ve been impressed with how much quality writing has been going on on LW2.0 so far. There has been <em>some</em> but not <em>as much</em> commenting as I&#x27;d like.</p><p>I&#x27;ve gotten a sense of what inspires interesting, meaty discussion. </p><p>Unfortunately, most of it seems... kinda bad?</p><h1>Things That Get People To Comment</h1><p><strong>1. Be Wrong - </strong>It has been said: if google fails you, the fastest way to get a question answered is to post a  <em>wrong answer </em>on reddit<em>.</em> This will result in a lot of flood of people explaining things to you.</p><p><strong>2. Be Controversial</strong> - Even better, post something that <em>some</em> people think are wrong. Then you get a bunch of people commenting to correct you, and then other people who disagree correcting <em>them!</em> The arguments perpetuate themselves from there. You won&#x27;t even have to do any commenting work yourself to keep it going!</p><p>[<em>BTW, these are observations, not recommendations. This list is optimized to answer the question &quot;what causes comments&quot; not &quot;how to make the world better.&quot;]</em></p><p><strong>3. Write About Things People Feel Qualified to Have Opinions On</strong> - If you write a post on machine learning, and post it somewhere where nobody really understands machine learning, it doesn&#x27;t matter if you&#x27;re wrong or controversial! Nobody will understand enough to care, or feel confident enough to argue. Some considerations:</p><ul><li>It&#x27;s not necessary for people to b<em>e </em>qualified. They just need to feel like they are.</li><li>If you write more informally (or in informal forums), people feel more entitled to respond.</li><li>You can either tailor your topic to an existing audience, or p<em>roactively try to get an</em> existing audience who understands your weird niche topic to read your post.</li></ul><p><strong>4. Invoke Social Reality</strong> - People pay more attention when you&#x27;re talking about social norms, or about changing coalitions of people, or arguing that some people are Bad and Wrong. This is for two reasons:</p><ul><li>Social Reality is powerful and scary. A person&#x27;s sense of social safety is one of the most important things to them. People like to know who is Bad and Wrong so that they can be on the other side. People like making sure that if social norms changing, they are changing in ways they understand and like (so that nobody later decides they are Bad and Wrong).</li><li>Social Reality almost always has something confusing and dumb going on that needs fixing, that people think is worth thinking about.</li><li>People<em> understand</em> Social Reality. Or, they think they do. (See #3)</li><li>Social Reality is often controversial! (See #2)</li></ul><p><strong>5. Be So Inspiring That People Create Entire Fandoms of Your Work</strong> - This worked for Eliezer and arguably Scott. It can probably be broken down into smaller steps. It&#x27;s pretty hard though. And a bunch of people <em>trying</em> but failing to do this can be annoying. (<em>I&#x27;ve</em> tried/failed to do this sometimes)</p><p>...</p><p>And then there&#x27;s...</p><p><strong>6. Leave People With An Unsolved Problem That They Care About</strong> - This is related to &quot;they feel qualified to have opinions&quot;, with the followup step of &quot;there is actual useful thinking they can contribute to, either to solve <em>your</em> problem, or to apply your idea to solve <em>their </em>problems.&quot;</p><h2>Things I&#x27;ve Noticed Myself Doing</h2><p>Since comments are socially validating, I&#x27;ve noticed a tendency for me to end up writing:</p><ul><li>Facebook posts, where people feel a lower barrier to entry. (If the shortform section of LessWrong were up, I might do that instead)</li><li>Unfinished thoughts, where there&#x27;s a good chance that I&#x27;m wrong about a few things (but not all things, and not wrong<em> on purpose to be provocative</em> which would feel skeezy<em>), </em>and where there&#x27;s still an unsolved problem that people will feel qualified to help out figure out.</li><li>Posts engaging with social norms (which people feel excited to weigh in on and/or afraid not to)</li><li>Posts engaging with personal habits that people can easily apply to their own life.</li></ul><p>This doesn&#x27;t all seem <em>bad, </em>necessarily. But I&#x27;ve noticed other people that seem to be doing similar things. I&#x27;ve also noticed some people who tried to get people to talk about important things, and failed, and gradually resorted to writing more provocative things to get people to pay attention (which succeeded!).</p><p>It seems like a rationality community warped by those incentives isn&#x27;t going to accomplish the things it needs to. </p><p>So, some open problems I&#x27;m thinking about, which maybe are relevant to you:</p><ul><li>I&#x27;d like feel <strong>incentivized to research things I don&#x27;t understand</strong> as much (which I don&#x27;t expect other people to understand as much either), to expand my (and our collective) domains of expertise.</li><li>Insofar as people do end up writing the sorts of posts listed above, I think it&#x27;d be good if people <strong>thought more consciously and carefully</strong> about which tools they&#x27;re employing. #6 at the very least seemed fine, and some of the others seem fine in some contexts.</li><li>I&#x27;d like to <strong>learn how to be a better commenter</strong>, on posts that <em>don&#x27;t</em> go out of their way to make it easy to comment.

Surprise events to the greenhorn are tired stereotypes for the old hand. But, sometimes, we can short-circuit this process and react wisely to a situation without long experience and hard knocks.</p><p>For example, if a person is trying to save money but sees a doodad they&#x27;d like to buy, the fool reason as follows: &quot;It&#x27;s just this one purchase. The amount of money isn&#x27;t very consequential to my overall budget. I can just save a little more in other ways and I&#x27;ll meet my target.&quot; The wise person reasons as follows: &quot;If I make this purchase now, I will similarly allow myself to make exceptions to my money-saving rule later, until the exception becomes the rule and I spend all my money. So, even though the amount of money here isn&#x27;t so large, I prefer to follow a general policy of saving, which implies saving in this particular case.&quot; A <em>very</em> wise  person may reason a bit more cleverly: &quot;I can make impulse purchases if they pass a high bar, such that I actually only let a few dollars of unplanned spending past the bar every week on average. How rare is it that a purchase opportunity costing this much is at least this appealing?&quot; **<em>does a quick check and usually doesn&#x27;t buy the thing, but sometimes does, when it is worth it</em>**</p><p>One way to get this kind of wisdom is by spending money for a long time, and calibrating willingness-to-spend based on what seems to be happening with your bank account. This <a href=""https://weird.solar/the-internal-lawyer-b00625428e1e"">doesn&#x27;t work very well</a> for a lot of people, because the reinforcement happens too slowly to be habit-forming. A different way is to notice the logic of the situation, and think <em>as though</em> you had lived it.</p><p>Similarly, although people are heavily biased to treat vivid examples from the news (airplane crashes involving celebrity deaths) or personal anecdotes from friends and family (an uncle who fell ill when a high-voltage power line was installed near his home) or worse, from strangers on the internet (the guy who got &quot;popcorn lung&quot; from smoking an e-cig), actually, statistics are far more powerful. (It&#x27;s true that medical anecdotes from family might be more relevant than statistics due to genetic factors shared with family members, but even so, taking the &quot;statistical view&quot; -- looking at the statistics available, including information about genetic conditions and heritability if available, and then making reasonable guesses about yourself based on your family -- will be better than just viewing your situation in isolation.)</p><p>I won&#x27;t lecture much on the implications of that -- most readers will be familiar with the availability heuristic, the base-rate fallacy, and scope insensitivity. Here, I just want to point out that putting more credence in numbers than vivid examples is an instance of the pattern I&#x27;m pointing at: placing your decision as an instance of a class, rather than seeing it in isolation.</p><p>In an abstract sense, the statistical view of any given decision -- the view of the decision as part of a class of relevantly similar decisions -- is &quot;more real&quot; than an attempt to view it in isolation as a unique moment. Not because it&#x27;s actually more real, but because this view is closer to your decision. Humans may exist in a single, deterministic universe -- but we <em>decide</em> in statistical space, where outcomes come in percentages.</p><p>When the weatherman says &quot;70% chance of rain&quot; in your area, but it is <em>already</em> raining outside, you know you&#x27;re one of the 70% -- he&#x27;s speaking to an area, and giving the percent of viewers in the area who will experience rain. He can&#x27;t just say 100% for those viewers who will experience rain and 0% for those who won&#x27;t. Similarly, when you make a decision, you&#x27;re doing it in a general area -- you can&#x27;t just decide to drive when you won&#x27;t crash and avoid driving when you will (though you can split up your decision by some relevant factors and avoid driving when risk is high).</p><p>This exact same intuition, of course, supports timeless/updateless decision theory even more directly than it supports probabilism. Perhaps some future generation will regard the idea of timeless/updateless decision-making as more fundamental and obvious than the doctrine of probabilism, and wonder why subjective probability was invented first.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>",abramdemski,abramdemski,abramdemski,

<p>A few years ago I had lunch with another psychiatrist-in-training and realized we had totally different experiences with psychotherapy.</p>
<p>We both got the same types of cases. We were both practicing the same kinds of therapy. We were both in the same training program, studying under the same teachers. But our experiences were totally different. In particular, all her patients had dramatic emotional meltdowns, and all my patients gave calm and considered analyses of their problems, as if they were lecturing on a particularly boring episode from 19th-century Norwegian history.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not bragging here. I <i>wish</i> I could get my patients to have dramatic emotional meltdowns. As per the textbooks, there should be a climactic moment where the patient identifies me with their father, then screams at me that I ruined their childhood, then breaks down crying and realizes that she loved her father all along, then ???, and then their depression is cured. I never got that. I tried, I even dropped some hints, like &#8220;Maybe this reminds you of your father?&#8221; or &#8220;Maybe you feel like screaming at me right now?&#8221;, but they never took the bait. So I figured the textbooks were misleading, or that this was some kind of super-advanced technique, or that this was among the approximately 100% of things that Freud just pulled out of his ass.</p>
<p>And then I had lunch with my friend, and she was like &#8220;It&#8217;s so stressful when all of your patients identify you with their parents and break down crying, isn&#8217;t it? Don&#8217;t you wish you could just go <i>one day</i> without that happening?&#8221;</p>
<p>And later, my supervisor was reviewing one of my therapy sessions, and I was surprised to hear him comment that I &#8220;seemed uncomfortable with dramatic expressions of emotion&#8221;. I mean, I <i>am</i> uncomfortable with dramatic expressions of emotion. I was just surprised he noticed it. As a therapist, I&#8217;m supposed to be quiet and encouraging and not show discomfort at anything, and I was trying to do that, and I&#8217;d thought I was succeeding. But apparently I was unconsciously projecting some kind of &#8220;I don&#8217;t like strong emotions, you&#8217;d better avoid those&#8221; field, and my patients were unconsciously complying.</p>
<p>I wish I could say my supervisor&#8217;s guidance fixed the problem and I learned to encourage emotional openness just as well as my colleague. But any improvement I made was incremental at best. My colleague is a bubbly extravert who gets very excited about everything; I worry that to match her results, I would have to somehow copy her entire personality.</p>
<p>But all was not lost. I found myself doing well with overly emotional patients, the sort who had <i>too many</i> dramatic meltdowns to do therapy with anybody else. With me, they tended to give calm and considered analyses of their problems, as if they were lecturing on a particularly boring episode from 19th-century Norwegian history. Everyone assumed that meant I was good at dealing with difficult cases, and must have read a bunch of books about how to defuse crises. I did nothing to disabuse them of this.</p>
<p>Then a few days ago I stumbled across the Reddit thread <A HREF=""https://np.reddit.com/r/SneerClub/comments/6e5avq/has_anyone_here_ever_been_to_an_lwssc_meetup_or/di81dq2/"">Has Anyone Here Ever Been To An LW/SSC Meetup Or Otherwise Met A Rationalist IRL?</A> User dgerard wrote about meeting me in 2011, saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>His superpower is that he projects a Niceness Field, where people talking to him face to face want to be more polite and civil. The only person I&#8217;ve met with a similar Niceness Field is Jimmy Wales from Wikipedia&#8230;when people are around [Jimmy] talking to him they feel a sort of urge to be civil and polite in discourse 🙂 I&#8217;ve seen people visibly trying to be very precise and polite talking to him about stuff even when they&#8217;re quite upset about whatever it is. Scott has this too. It&#8217;s an interesting superpower to observe.</p></blockquote>
<p>I should admit nobody else has mentioned anything like this, and that narcissism biases me toward believing anyone who says I have a superpower. Still, it would explain a lot. And not necessarily in a good way. I&#8217;ve always believed psychodynamic therapies are mostly ineffective, and cognitive-behavioral therapies very effective, because all my patients seem to defy the psychodynamic mode of having having weird but emotionally dramatic reactions to things in their past, but conform effortlessly to the cognitive-behavioral mode of being able to understand and rationally discuss their problems. And the more I examine this, the more I realize that my results are pretty atypical for psychiatrists. There&#8217;s something I&#8217;m doing &#8211; totally by accident &#8211; to produce those results. This is worrying not just as a psychiatrist, but as someone who wants to know anything about other people at all.</p>
<p><b>II.</b></p>
<p>New topic: paranoia and Williams Syndrome.</p>
<p>Paranoia is a common symptom of various psychiatric disorders &#8211; most famously schizophrenia, but also paranoid personality disorder, delusional disorder, sometimes bipolar disorder. You can also get it from abusing certain drugs &#8211; marijuana, LSD, cocaine, and even prescription drugs like Adderall and Ritalin. The fun thing about paranoia is how gradual it is. Sure, if you abuse every single drug at once you&#8217;ll think the CIA is after you with their mind-lasers. But if you just take a <i>little</i> more Adderall than you were supposed to, you&#8217;ll be 1% paranoid. You&#8217;ll have a very mild tendency to interpret ambiguous social signals just a little bit more negatively than usual. If a friend leaves without saying goodbye, and you would normally think &#8220;Oh, I guess she had a train to catch&#8221;, instead you think &#8220;Hm, I wonder what she meant by that&#8221;. There are a bunch of good stimulant abuse cases in the literature that present as &#8220;patient&#8217;s boss said she was unusually standoffish and wanted her to get psychiatric evaluation&#8221;, show up in the office as &#8220;well of course I&#8217;m standoffish, everyone in my office excludes me from everything and is rude in a thousand little ways throughout the day&#8221;, and end up as &#8220;cut your Adderall dosage in half, please&#8221;.</p>
<p>(&#8220;Why is that psychiatrist telling me to cut my Adderall in half? Does he think I&#8217;m lying about having ADHD? Is he calling me a liar? These doctors have always treated me like garbage. I HAVE RIGHTS, YOU KNOW!&#8221;)</p>
<p>Williams Syndrome is much rarer &#8211; only about 1/10,000 people, and most of them die before reaching adulthood. It&#8217;s marked by a sort of anti-paranoia; Williams patients are incapable of distrusting anyone. NPR has a good article, <A HREF=""http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=126224885"">A Life Without Fear</A>, describing some of what they go through:</p>
<blockquote><p>Kids and adults with Williams love people, and they are literally pathologically trusting. They have no social fear. Researchers theorize that this is probably because of a problem in their limbic system, the part of the brain that regulates emotion. There appears to be a disregulation in one of the chemicals (oxytocin) that signals when to trust and when to distrust. This means that it is essentially biologically impossible for [them] to distrust.</p></blockquote>
<p>The results are less than heartwarming:</p>
<blockquote><p>As Isabelle got older, the negative side of her trusting nature began to play a larger role. A typical example happened a couple of years ago, when Jessica and her family were spending the day at the beach. Isabelle had been begging Jessica to go to Dairy Queen, and Jessica had been putting her off. Then Isabelle overheard a lady just down the beach.</p>
<p>&#8220;She was telling her kids, &#8216;OK, let&#8217;s go to the Dairy Queen,&#8217; &#8221; Jessica says. &#8220;And so Isabelle went over and got into the lady&#8217;s van, got in the back seat, buckled up and was waiting to be taken to Dairy Queen with that family.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jessica had no idea what had happened to Isabelle and was frantically searching for her when the driver of the van approached her and explained that she had been starting her car when she looked up and saw Isabelle&#8217;s face in the rearview mirror.</p>
<p>The woman, Jessica says, was incredibly angry.</p>
<p>&#8220;She said, &#8216;I am a stranger, you know!&#8217; &#8221; Jessica says. Essentially, the woman blamed Jessica for not keeping closer watch on her daughter — for neglecting to teach her the importance of not getting into a car with someone she didn’t know. But the reality could not be more different. &#8220;It&#8217;s like, &#8216;My friend, you have no idea,&#8217; &#8221; Jessica says.</p>
<p>In fact, because of Isabelle, Jessica has had to rethink even the most basic elements of her day-to-day life. She can not take Isabelle to the dog park. She tries not to take Isabelle to the store. And when the doorbell rings, Jessica will leap over a coffee table to intercept her.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just Jessica and her family who must be vigilant. Every teacher at Isabelle&#8217;s public school has been warned. Isabelle is not allowed to tell them that she loves them. Isabelle is not supposed to tell other schoolchildren that she loves them. And there are other restrictions.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s not allowed to go to the bathroom alone at her school, because there have been numerous instances of girls with Williams syndrome being molested at school when they were alone in the hallway,&#8221; Jessica says. &#8220;And these are like middle class type schools. So it&#8217;s a very real problem. And, you know, I&#8217;d rather her be overly safe than be on CNN.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Some of the research on these kids is fascinating &#8211; I&#8217;m not sure I believe the study finding that they&#8217;re <A HREF=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20392417"">incapable of racism</A>, but the one finding <A HREF=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20005240"">a deficit detecting anger in faces</A> seems pretty plausible.</p>
<p>Williams Syndrome usually involves mental retardation, but not always. Some of these people have normal IQ. It doesn&#8217;t really help. Threat-detection seems to be an automated process not totally susceptible to System II control. Maybe it&#8217;s like face-blindness. Intelligence can help a face-blind person come up with some systems to reduce the impact of their condition, but in the end it&#8217;s just not going to help that much.</p>
<p>Psychiatric disorders are often at the extremes of natural variation in human traits. For every intellectually disabled person, there are a dozen who are just kind of dumb. For every autistic person, there are a dozen who are just sort of nerdy. And so on. We naturally think of some people as more trusting than others, but maybe that isn&#8217;t the best frame. &#8220;Trusting&#8221; implies that we all receive the same information, and just choose how much risk we&#8217;re willing to tolerate. I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s true at all.</p>
<p>A recent theme here has been <A HREF=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/09/05/book-review-surfing-uncertainty/"">the ways that our sense-data is underdetermined</A>. Each datum permits multiple possible explanations: this is true of visual and auditory perception, but also of the social world. A pretty girl laughs a little too long at a man&#8217;s joke; is she trying to flirt with him, or just friendly? A boss calls her subordinate&#8217;s work &#8220;okay&#8221; &#8211; did she mean to compliment him, or imply it was mediocre? A friend breaks off two appointments in a row, each time saying that something has come up &#8211; did something come up, or is he getting tired of the friendship? These are the sorts of questions everyone navigates all the time, usually with enough success that when autistic people screw them up, the rest of society nods sagely and says they need to learn to understand how to read context.</p>
<p>But &#8220;context&#8221; means &#8220;priors&#8221;, and priors can differ from person to person. There&#8217;s a lot of room for variation here before we get to the point where somebody will be so off-base that they end up excluded from society. Just as there&#8217;s a spectrum from smart to dumb, or from introverted to extraverted, so there&#8217;s a spectrum in people&#8217;s tendencies to interpret ambiguous situations in a positive or negative way. There are people walking around who are just short of clinically paranoid, or just shy of Williams Syndrome levels of trust. And this isn&#8217;t a value difference, it&#8217;s a perceptual one. These people aren&#8217;t bitter or risk-averse &#8211; or at least they don&#8217;t <i>start off</i> that way. They just notice how everyone&#8217;s hostile to them, all the time.</p>
<p><b>III.</b></p>
<p>Another change in topic: bubbles.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve written before about how <A HREF=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/30/i-can-tolerate-anything-except-the-outgroup/"">46% of Americans are young-earth creationists</A>, and how strongly that fails to square with my personal experience. I&#8217;ve met young-earth creationists once or twice. But of my hundred closest friends/co-workers/acquaintances, I think zero percent of them fall in that category. I&#8217;m not intentionally selecting friends on the basis of politics, religion, or anything else. It just seems to have happened. Something about my personality, location, social class, et cetera has completely isolated me from one particular half of the US population; I&#8217;m living in a non-creationist bubble in the midst of a half-creationist country.</p>
<p>What other bubbles do I live in? A quick look over my Facebook and some SSC survey results finds that my friends are about twenty times more likely to be transgender than the general population. There are about twice as many Asians but less than half as many African-Americans. Rates of depression, OCD, and autism are sky-high; rates of drug addiction and alcoholism are very low. Programmers are overrepresented at about ten times the Bay Area average.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t intend any of these bubbles. For example, I&#8217;ve never done any programming myself, I&#8217;m not interested in it, and I try my best to avoid programmer-heavy places where I know all the conversations are going to be programming-related. Hasn&#8217;t helped. And I&#8217;m about as cisgender as can be, I have several Problematic opinions, and I still can&#8217;t keep track of which gender all of my various friends are on a month-to-month basis. Part of it is probably class-, race-, and location-based. And I have some speculative theories about the rest &#8211; I think I have a pretty thing-oriented/systematizing thinking style, and so probably I get along better with other groups disproportionately made up of people whose thoughts work the <A HREF=""https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/11/the-link-between-autism-and-trans-identity/507509/"">same</A> way &#8211; but I didn&#8217;t understand any of this until a few years ago and there are still some parts that don&#8217;t make sense. For now I just have to accept it as a given.</p>
<p>There are other bubbles I understand much better. Most of my friends are pretty chill and conflict-averse. This is because I used to have scarier conflict-prone friends, and as soon as I got into conflicts with them, I broke off the friendship. I&#8217;m not super-proud of this and it&#8217;s probably one of those maladaptive coping styles you always hear about, and a lot of people have told me I&#8217;m really extreme on this axis and need to be better at tolerating aggressive people &#8211; but whenever I try, I find it unpleasant and stop. I know some other people who seem to actively seek out abrasive types so they can get in fun fights with them. I don&#8217;t understand these people at all &#8211; but whatever their thought processes, we have different bubbles.</p>
<p>All of this goes double or triple for people I&#8217;ve dated. I don&#8217;t think of myself as clearly having a &#8220;type&#8221;, but people I date tend to turn out similar in dimensions I didn&#8217;t expect when I first met them. I&#8217;m going to be ambiguous here because it&#8217;s a small enough sample that I don&#8217;t want to give away people&#8217;s private information, but it&#8217;s true.</p>
<p>I think about this a lot when I meet serial abuse victims.</p>
<p>These people are a heartbreaking psychiatric cliche. Abused by their parents, abused by their high school boyfriend, abused by their first husband, abused by their second husband, abused by the guy they cheated on their first husband with, abused by the friend they tried to go to for help dealing with all the abuse. The classic (though super offensive) <A HREF=""http://www.escapeabuse.com/?p=155"">explanation</A> is that some people seek out abusers for some reason &#8211; maybe because they were abused as children and they&#8217;ve internalized that as the &#8220;correct&#8221; model of a relationship.</p>
<p>And maybe this is true for some people. I have a friend who admits it&#8217;s true of her &#8211; her current strategy is to try to find someone in the sweet spot between &#8220;jerkish/narcissistic enough to be interesting&#8221; and &#8220;jerkish/narcissistic enough to actually abuse her&#8221;, and she&#8217;s said so in so many words to people trying to matchmake. I guess all I can do is wish her luck.</p>
<p>But for a lot of people, this sort of claim is just as offensively wrong as it sounds. I know people who have tried really hard to avoid abusers, who have gone to therapy and asked their therapist for independent verification that their new partner doesn&#8217;t seem like the abusive type, who have pulled out all the stops &#8211; and who still end up with abusive new partners. These people are cursed through no fault of their own. All I can say is that whatever mysterious forces connect me to transgender pro-evolution programmers are connecting them to abusers. Something completely unintentional that they try their best to resist gives them a bubble of terrible people. </p>
<p>I want to emphasize as hard as I can that I&#8217;m not blaming them or saying there&#8217;s anything they can do about their situation, and I have no doubt that despite my emphasis people are still going to accuse me of saying this, and I apologize if any of this sounds at all like anything in this direction. But <i>something</i> has to be happening here.</p>
<p><b>IV.</b></p>
<p>Sometimes I write about discrimination, and people send me emails about their own experiences. Many sound like this real one (quoted here with permission) from a woman who studied computer science at MIT and now works in the tech industry:</p>
<blockquote><p>In my life, I have never been catcalled, inappropriately hit on, body-shamed, unwantedly touched in a sexual way, discouraged from a male-dominated field, told I couldn&#8217;t do something because it was a boy thing, or suffered from many other experiences that have traditionally served as examples as ways that women are less privileged. I have also never been shamed for not following gender norms (e.g. doing a bunch of math/science/CS stuff); instead I get encouraged and told that I&#8217;m a role model. I&#8217;ve never had problems going around wearing no make-up, a t-shirt, and cargo pants; but on the rare occasion that I do wear make-up / wear a dress, that&#8217;s completely socially acceptable&#8230;Hopefully my thoughts/experiences are helpful for your future social justice based discussions.</p></blockquote>
<p>Other times they sound like the opposite. I don&#8217;t have anyone in this category who&#8217;s given me permission to quote their email verbatim (consider ways this might not be a coincidence), but they&#8217;re pretty much what you&#8217;d expect &#8211; a litany of constantly being put down, discriminated against, harassed, et cetera, across multiple jobs, at multiple companies, to the point where they complain it&#8217;s &#8220;endemic&#8221; (I guess I can quote one word) and that we need to reject a narrative of &#8220;a few bad apples&#8221; because really it&#8217;s a problem with <i>all</i> men to one degree or another.</p>
<p>These dueling categories of emails have always confused me. At the risk of being exactly the sort of creepy person the second set of writers complain about, I hunted down some of these people&#8217;s Facebook profiles to see if one group was consistently more attractive than the other. They weren&#8217;t. Nor is there any clear pattern in what industries or companies they work at, what position they&#8217;re in, or anything else like that. There isn&#8217;t even a consistent pattern in their politics. The woman I quote above mentions that she&#8217;s a feminist who believes discrimination is a major problem &#8211; which has only made it extra confusing to her that she never experiences any of it personally.</p>
<p>These people don&#8217;t just show up in my inbox. Some of them write articles on <A HREF=""http://www.slate.com/articles/life/dear_prudence/2015/02/dear_prudence_feminists_are_upset_that_i_don_t_have_much_sexism_to_complain.html"">Slate</A>, <A HREF=""https://medium.com/@maradydd/okay-feminism-its-time-we-had-a-talk-about-empathy-bd6321c66b37"">Medium</A>, even <A HREF=""https://thetab.com/us/2016/06/09/im-black-im-south-ive-never-discriminated-13788"">The New Yorker</A>, discussing not just how they&#8217;ve never experienced discrimination, but how much anger and backlash they&#8217;ve received when they try to explain this to everyone else. And all of them acknowledge that they know other people whose experiences seem to be the direct opposite.</p>
<p>I used to think this was pretty much just luck of the draw &#8211; some people will end up with nice people at great companies, other people will end up with bigots at terrible companies. I no longer think this explains everybody. Take that New Yorker article, by a black person who grew up in the South and says she was never discriminated against even once. I assume in her childhood she met thousands of different white Southerners; that&#8217;s a pretty big lucky streak for none of them at all to be racists, especially when you consider all the people who report daily or near-daily harassment. Likewise, when you study computer science in college and then work in half a dozen tech companies over the space of decades and never encounter one sexist, that&#8217;s quite the record. Surely something else must be going on here.</p>
<p><b>V.</b></p>
<p>And I think this has to come back to the sorts of things discussed in Parts I, II, and III.</p>
<p>People self-select into bubbles along all sorts of axes. Some of these bubbles are obvious and easy to explain, like rich people mostly meeting other rich people at the country club. Others are more mysterious, like how some non-programmer ends up with mostly programmer friends. Still others are horrible and completely outside comprehension, like someone who tries very hard to avoid abusers but ends up in multiple abusive relationships anyway. Even for two people living in the same country, city, and neighborhood, they can have a &#8220;society&#8221; made up of very different types of people.</p>
<p>People vary widely on the way they perceive social interaction. A paranoid schizophrenic will view every interaction as hostile; a Williams Syndrome kid will view every interaction as friendly. In between, there will be a whole range of healthy people without any psychiatric disorder who tend toward one side or the other. Only the most blatant data can be interpreted absent the priors that these dispositions provide; everything else will only get processed through preexisting assumptions about how people tend to act. Since things like racism rarely take the form of someone going up to you and saying &#8220;Hello, I am a racist and because of your skin color I plan to discriminate against you in the following ways&#8230;&#8221;, they&#8217;ll end up as ambiguous stimuli that everyone will interpret differently.</p>
<p>Finally, some people have personalities or styles of social interaction that unconsciously compel a certain response from their listeners. Call these &#8220;niceness fields&#8221; or &#8220;meanness fields&#8221; or whatever: some people are the sort who &#8211; if they became psychotherapists &#8211; would have patients who constantly suffered dramatic emotional meltdowns, and others&#8217; patients would calmly discuss their problems.</p>
<p>The old question goes: are people basically good or basically evil? Different philosophers give different answers. But so do different random people I know who aren&#8217;t thinking philosophically at all. Some people describe a world of backstabbing Machiavellians, where everybody&#8217;s a shallow social climber who will kick down anyone it takes to get to the top. Other people describe a world where everyone is basically on the same page, trying to be nice to everyone else but getting stuck in communication difficulties and honest disagreements over values.</p>
<p>I think both groups are right. Some people experience worlds of basically-good people who treat them nicely. Other people experience worlds of awful hypocritical backstabbers. This can be true even if they live in the same area as each other, work the same job as each other, et cetera.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s not just a basic good-evil axis. It can be about whether people are emotional/dramatic or calm/rational. It can be about whether people almost always discriminate or almost never do. It can be about whether they&#8217;re honest or liars, shun outsiders or accept them, welcome criticism or reject it. Some people think elites are incompetent parasites; others that they&#8217;re <A HREF=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/ub/competent_elites/"">shockingly competent people</A> who mean well and have interesting personalities. Some people <A HREF=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/05/11/silicon-valley-a-reality-check/"">think Silicon Valley is</A> full of overpriced juicers, other people that it&#8217;s full of structured-light engines. And the people who say all these things are usually accurately reporting their own experiences.</p>
<p>Some people are vaguely aware of this in the form of &#8220;privilege&#8221;, which acknowledges different experiences at the cost of saying they have to line up exactly along special identity categories like race and gender. These certainly don&#8217;t help, but it&#8217;s not that simple &#8211; as proven by the article by that black Southerner who says she never once encountered discrimination. I&#8217;ve seen completely incomprehensible claims about human nature by people of precisely the same race, sex, class, orientation, etc as myself, and I have no doubt they&#8217;re trying to be truthful. The things that divide us are harder to see than we naively expect. Sometimes they&#8217;re completely invisible.</p>
<p>To return to a common theme: <i>nothing makes sense except in light of inter-individual variation</i>. Variation in people&#8217;s <A HREF=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/03/17/what-universal-human-experiences-are-you-missing-without-realizing-it/"">internal experience</A>. Variation in people&#8217;s <A HREF=""https://squid314.livejournal.com/337475.html"">basic beliefs and assumptions</A>. Variation in <A HREF=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/11/03/what-developmental-milestones-are-you-missing/"">level of abstract thought</A>. And to all of this I would add a variation in our experience of other people. Some of us are convinced, with reason, that humankind is basically good. Others start the day the same way Marcus Aurelius did:</p>
<blockquote><p>When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: the people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous and surly. They are like this because they cannot tell good from evil.</p></blockquote>
<p>Notice this distinction, this way in which geographic neighbors can live in different worlds, and other people&#8217;s thoughts and behaviors get a little more comprehensible.</p>",Yvain,scottalexander,Scott Alexander,

</style></head><body><p>After Johannes Treutlein's comment on <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1525"">Smoking Lesion Steelman</a>, and a number of other considerations, I had almost entirely given up on CDT. However, there were still nagging questions about whether the kind of self-ignorance needed in Smoking Lesion Steelman could arise naturally, how it should be dealt with if so, and what role counterfactuals ought to play in decision theory if CDT-like behavior is incorrect. Today I sat down to collect all the arguments which have been rolling around in my head on this and related issues, and arrived at a place much closer to CDT than I expected.</p>
<hr>
<p>CDT differs from EDT only in those cases where a parent of the decision node is not directly observed. If the causal parents of a decision are all observations, then there is no probabilistic relationship for causal reasoning to remove. So, there are two critical questions to motivate CDT as an alternative to EDT:</p>
<ol>
<li>(Existence of cases where CDT <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\neq""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">≠</span></span></span></span></span></span> EDT) Are there necessarily parents of the decision which cannot be observed?</li>
<li>(Correctness of CDT) If so, is CDT the correct way to account for this?</li>
</ol>
<h2>Existence of Cases</h2>
<p>Smoking Lesion Steelman was an attempt to set up a scenario answering #1. However, it was very contrived; I had to specifically rob the agents of all introspection and set up an important piece of knowledge about their own decision process which they lacked. Are there more natural examples?</p>
<p>Certainly there will be influences on a real agent's decision process which the agent cannot observe. For example, it is always possible for a cosmic ray to hit a computer and change the output of decision calculation. However, CDT doesn't seem to help with this. The right way to guard against this is vie fault-tolerant implementations which use redundant calculations and memory; but to the extent that a decision procedure might guard against it by having checks in the world-model saying ""if things look too goofy I've probably been hit in the head"", CDT would potentially sever those probabilistic links, keeping the agent from inferring that it is in an error state. (More on this kind of failure of CDT later.)</p>
<p>Sam Eisenstat has argued (in an in-person discussion) that an example of #1 is the consistency of the logic an agent uses. In the <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=369"">counterexample to the trolljecture</a>, an agent reasons as if if had control over the consistency of its logic, leading to an intuitively wrong decision. Perhaps consistency should be thought of as a parent of the decision, so that CDT-like reasoning would avoid the mistake. Sam also has a probabilistic version of this, to show that it's not just a peculiarity of MUDT. The probabilistic version is not consistent with logical induction, so I'm <em>still</em> not sure whether this situation can arise when an agent is build with best practices; but, I can't entirely dismiss it right now, either. (It's also unclear whether the consistency of the logic should be treated as a causal parent of a decision in general; but, in this case, it does seem like we want CDT-like reasoning: ""my action cannot possibly <em>influence</em> whether my logic is consistent, even if it provides <em>evidence</em> as to whether my logic is consistent"".)</p>
<h2>Correctness</h2>
<p>As for #2, Johannes' <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1585"">comment</a> helped convince me that CDT isn't doing exactly the right thing to account for inputs to the decision process which can't be observed. A discussion with Tom Everitt also helped me see what's going on: he pointed out that CDT fails to make use of all available information when planning. Johannes' example fits that idea, but for another example, suppose that an absent-minded football fan always forgets which team is their favorite. They know that <em>if</em> they buy sports memorabilia, they almost always buy their favorite team's gear on impulse. They also know that if they purchased the wrong team's gear, they would hate it; and on the other hand, they love having their favorite team's gear. They find themselves choosing between mugs for several different teams. Should they make a purchase?</p>
<p>EDT says that conditioned on making a purchase, it was very likely to be the right team. Therefore, it is a good idea to make the purchase. CDT, on the other hand, treats the favorite team as an un-observed input to the decision process. Since it is a causal parent, the probabilistic connection gets cut; so, the CDT agent doesn't make the inference that whatever mug they pick is likely to be the right one. Instead, since they're choosing between several mugs, each mug is individually more likely to be the wrong one than the right one. So, CDT doesn't buy a mug.</p>
<p><em>(The reader may be concerned that this problem is ill-specified for the same reason the standard Smoking Lesion is ill-specified: if the agent is running CDT or EDT, how is it possible that it has a bias toward choosing the right team? We can address this concern with a less extreme version of the trick I used on Smoking Lesion: the decision procedure runs CDT or EDT utility calculations, but then adds epsilon utility to the expected value of any purchase involving the favorite team, which breaks ties in the expected value calculation. This is enough to make the EDT agent reliably purchase the right gear.)</em></p>
<p>Intuitively, what's going on here is that CDT is refusing to make use of important information in making its decision. EDT goes wrong by confusing evidence for influence; CDT goes wrong by discarding the evidence along with the influence. To the extent that which action we take tells us important information about ourselves which we didn't already know, we want to take this into account when making a decision.</p>
<p>But how can we ""take this information into account"" without confusing causation and correlation? We can't <em>both</em> change our expectation to account for the information <em>and</em> hold the probability of causal parents still when making a decision, can we? What sort of decision rule would allow us to get all the examples so far right in a principled way?</p>
<h2>An Idea from Correlated Equilibria</h2>
<p>I won't be very surprised if the following proposal is already present in the literature. This is a revision of what I proposed in response to Johannes' comment, which he pointed out did not work (which was similar to <em>Gandalf's Solution to the Newcomb Problem</em> by Ralph Wedgewood, which Johannes pointed me to). It also bears some resemblance to <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1279"">a post of Scott's</a>.</p>
<p>It seems to me that the problem comes from the fact that when we condition on the <em>actual</em> action we will take, we get <em>good</em> information, which we <em>want</em> to incorporate into our beliefs for the sake of making the right decision. However, when we condition on taking some <em>other</em> action, we get <em>bad</em> information which we <em>don't</em> want to use for making the kind of inference about ourselves which we need in order to get the football-mug example right.</p>
<p>This reminds me of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlated_equilibrium"">correlated equilibria</a>, which have been discussed quite a bit around MIRI lately. In one way of setting them up, some outside information tells each agent what action to take, with a joint distribution on actions known to all agents. If all agents would accept this advice, then the joint distribution is a stable equilibrium. So, (1) you know which action you will take -- not just what probability you have on different actions, as in Nash equilibria; and (2) a max-expected-value calculation still decides to take that action, after knowing what it is.</p>
<p>This inspired me to try the following decision rule:</p>

<p>IE, the chosen action must be the best causal intervention, after taking into account (as <em>evidence</em>) the fact that we chose it. <s>I'll call this CEDT (correlated equilibrium DT) for now.</s> <em>Scott pointed out that this is a pretty bad name, since many concepts of rationality, including Nash equilibria and logical induction, can be seen as having this property of approving of their output under the condition that they know their output. I therefore re-name it to <strong>causal-evidential decision theory</strong> (CEDT).</em></p>
<p>Note that there may be several consistent fixed-points of the above equation. If so, we have a problem of selecting fixed-points, just like we do with Nash equilibria. Bad choices may be self-fulfilling prophecies.</p>
<p>In the football-mug scenario, every mug becomes an equilibrium solution; taking the mug is evidence that it is the right one, so switching to other mugs looks like a bad idea. Not buying a mug is also an equilibrium. To keep my assumption that the decision is almost always right if the merchandise is purchased, I must suppose that the right equilibrium gets selected (by whatever process does that): the right mug is purchased.</p>
<p>In the cosmic ray example, if some particular action is strong evidence of cosmic-ray-induced malfunction, such that the AI should enter a ""safely shut down"" mode, then this action cannot be an equilibrium; the AI would switch to shutdown if it observed it. Whether the fact that it isn't an equilibrium actually helps it to happen less given cosmic ray exposure is another question. (The CDT-style reasoning may still be cutting other links which would help detect failure; but more importantly, decision theory still isn't the right way to increase robustness against cosmic rays.)</p>
<p>In the Smoking Lesion Steelman scenario, non-smoke-loving CEDT robots would decline to smoke no matter what action they thought they'd take, since it only costs them. So, the only equilibrium is for them not to smoke. The smoke-loving CEDT robots would smoke if they were told they were going to smoke, or if they were told they wouldn't; so the only equilibrium for them has them doing so.</p>
<p>In Suicidal Smoking Lesion Steelman (Johannes' variant), the non-smoke-lovers again don't smoke. On the other hand, if I've thought this through correctly, smoke-lovers may either smoke or not smoke: if they're told they don't smoke, then they aren't sure whether they'll be killed or not; so, switching to smoking looks too dangerous. On the other hand, if they're told that they <em>do</em> smoke, then they know they <em>will</em> die, so they're happy to smoke.</p>
<p>So, in the examples I've looked at, it seems like CEDT always <em>includes</em> the desired behavior as a <em>possible</em> equilibrium. I'm not sure how to measure the ""best"" equilibrium and select it. Selecting based on expected value would seem to re-introduse EDT-style mistakes: it might select equilibria where its actions hide some information, so as to increase EV. Another candidate is to select based on the expected benefit, <em>after</em> updating on what action is taken, of taking that action rather than alternatives; IE, the <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1630"">gain</a>. This isn't obviously correct either.</p>
<p>This isn't a final solution, by any means, but it is enough to make me willing to say that CDT isn't so far off the mark. As long as a CDT agent knows its own action before it has decided, <em>and</em> is given the right causal representation of the problem, then it at least <em>can</em> get examples like this right, supposing it happens to be in the right fix-point.</p>

We can&#x27;t just admit we think it&#x27;s better for the international system if we do things that way in general, so that we have fewer, larger national governments which we think is a public good. That goes against the mythology of democratic self-determination, and governments deriving their power from the consent of the governed.</p><p>So instead of appealing to it being best for everyone if the international order stays stable instead of fragmenting into ten thousand pieces, and this making it wiser not to disturb the current tacit policy that governments are allowed to keep whatever population-properties they currently own whether those people consent to it or not...</p><p>...people be like, &quot;But the secession referendum is ILLEGAL! According to the CONSTITUTION OF SPAIN!&quot;</p><p>I don&#x27;t think I really understand this, in the sense that I don&#x27;t think I could pass the Ideological Turing Test of somebody who can think that while keeping a straight face. One government passes a law saying that a population is not allowed to have their own government--and people are capable of getting worked up and indignant about that population trying to get it anyway, because that means for Catalonia to have an independence referendum is ILLEGAL?</p><p>I mean, really? This might make sense if they were voting to independently legalize marijuana or something. But the whole point of this vote is exactly to withdraw their &quot;consent of the governed&quot; from the Spanish Constitution and be governed by a different constitution instead. How on Earth are we supposed to be morally indignant about the illegality of that according to the Spanish Constitution? Where on Earth do people suppose a higher legitimacy could come from, to say what constitution is <em>illegal</em> for someone to consent to be governed by? There&#x27;s superior military force, sure, but to be <em>indignant</em> about the <em>illegality</em> of somebody defying that?</p><p>There&#x27;s more people in the USA than in Spain. Can we, like, amend our Constitution to say that Spain is part of the US and doesn&#x27;t get to hold separate independence referendums unless the whole population of the US-plus-Spain can participate? Should one then be terribly indignant if Spain tries to hold a separate independence vote when that is ILLEGAL under the CONSTITUTION OF THE US-PLUS-SPAIN which has, DEMOCRATICALLY by a MAJORITY vote of that whole population, determined that the US+S includes Spain?</p><p>My best guess as to what people could possibly be thinking is this:</p><p>For them, the Law is a reified thing.</p><p>The Law in Spain isn&#x27;t, like, a thing that a bunch of politicians, elected by a Spanish majority of Spain-plus-Catalonia, got together and wrote to govern a bunch of Catalan people. It&#x27;s not the word and opinion of one government, that thinks it owns a populace, which declares that populace is not allowed to vote to form a different government, backed up by superior military force. It&#x27;s the Law, and the Law is above everything, even governments.</p><p>Also, the Law is whatever currently has police and a military backing it up. That&#x27;s how we can tell what the Law is, the Law has police. It&#x27;s not that the police <em>make</em> the Law, it&#x27;s just a sign by which one&#x27;s brain detects the Law.</p><p>And then that Law is this reified <em>thing</em> floating in the air above everyone, and it can make a Catalan independence vote every bit as wrong-because-it-is-ILLEGAL as jaywalking.</p><p>Whereas the USA doesn&#x27;t have police in Spain right now, so obviously the US Constitution is <em>not</em> the Law in Spain, so it just feels silly to imagine the US claiming that it had some law or other that gave it ownership of Spain. That would just be one bunch of people saying that they&#x27;re a majority of themselves plus a smaller bunch of people, and declaring they held a democratic majority vote determining that the smaller bunch of people aren&#x27;t allowed to have their own government. The two cases are obviously completely different! The US+S isn&#x27;t even an ontologically basic unit that incorporates Spain in an ontologically basic way!</p><p>I&#x27;m guessing that&#x27;s what those people are thinking on that wordless level?</p><p>But I don&#x27;t think I could write the internal dialogue of a character who thinks like that, and have them be a convincing human being.</p></div></div></div></div>",Eliezer_Yudkowsky,eliezer_yudkowsky,Eliezer Yudkowsky,

Still only </em>moderately <em>confident though.</em></p><p>So, I notice that people involved with the rationalsphere have three major classes of motivations:</p><p><strong>Truthseeking</strong> (how to think clearly and understand the world)</p><p><strong>Human/Personal</strong> (how to improve your life and that of your friends/family)</p><p><strong>Impact</strong> (how to change/improve the the world at large)</p><p>All three motivations can involve rationality. Many people who end up involved care about all three areas to some degree, and have at least some interest in both epistemic and instrumental rationality. And at least within the rationalsphere, the Personal and the Impact motivations are generally rooted in Truth.</p><p>But people vary in whether these motivations are terminal, or instrumental. They also have different intuitions about which are most important - or about how to pursue a given goal. This sometimes results in confusion, annoyance, distrust, and exasperated people working at cross purposes.</p><h2>Terminal vs Instrumental Truth</h2><p>For some, truthseeking is important because the world is confusing. Whether you&apos;re focused on your personal life or on changing the world, there&apos;s a lot of ways you might screw up because something seems right but doesn&apos;t work or has a lot of negative externalities. It&apos;s necessary to do research, to think clearly, and to be constantly on the lookout for new facts that might weigh on your decisions.</p><p>For others, truth-seeking seems more like a fundamental part of who they are. Even if it didn&apos;t seem necessary, they&apos;d do it anyway because because it just seems like the right thing to do.</p><p>I think there&apos;s a couple layers of conflict here. The first is that instrumental-truthseekers tend to have an intuition that lots of other things matter as much or more than truth. </p><blockquote>It&apos;s more important to be able to launch a startup confidently than to have an accurate perception of its chance of success. It&apos;s important not to immediately criticize people because that disincentivizes them from trying new things. Interpersonal relationships seem to need 5x as many compliments as criticisms to flourish. It&apos;s important to be able to run a successful marketing campaign, and even if you&apos;re trying to run an honest marketing campaign, comprehensive honesty requires effort that might be better spent on actually building your product or something. </blockquote><blockquote>It may even be necessary to schmooze with people you don&apos;t respect because they have power and you need their help if you&apos;re going to make a dent in the universe.</blockquote><p>Then, there are people (who tend to be terminal-truthseekers, although not always), who counter:</p><blockquote>Earnest truthseeking is incredibly rare and precious. In almost every movement, it gets sacrificed on the altar of practicality and in-group solidarity. Can&apos;t we just once have a movement where truthseeking is the primary thing that never gets sacrificed? </blockquote><blockquote>This doesn&apos;t just seem worth trying for the novelty of it: the world seems so deeply confusing, the problems it faces seem so immense and so entwined with tribal-politics that distort the truth, that we probably need a movement of impact-oriented truthseekers who never compromise their intellectual integrity no matter what.</blockquote><p>I find this argument fairly compelling (at least for a deeper delve into the concept). But what&apos;s interesting is that even if it&apos;s an overriding concern, <em>it doesn&apos;t really clarify what to do next.</em></p><h2>The Trouble With Truthseeking While Human</h2><p>On the one hand, social reality is a thing. </p><p>Most cultures involve social pressure to cheer for your ingroup&apos;s ideas, to refrain from criticizing your authority figures. They often involve social pressure to say &quot;no, that outfit doesn&apos;t make you look fat&quot; whether or not that&apos;s true. They often involve having overt, stated goals for an organization (lofty and moral sounding) that seem at <a href=""https://www.lesserwrong.com/posts/8iAJ9QsST9X9nzfFy/nobody-does-the-thing-that-they-are-supposedly-doing"">odds with what the organization ends up doing</a> - and if you try to mention the disconnect between what people are saying and what they are doing, they get upset and angry at you challenging their self-conception.</p><p>The pressure to conform to social reality is both powerful and subtle. Even if you&apos;re trying to just think clearly, privately for yourself, you may find your eyes, ears and brain conforming to social reality anyway - an instinctive impulse to earnestly believe the things that are in your best interest, so you peers never notice that you are doubting the tribe. I have noticed myself doing this, and it is scary.</p><p>In the face of that pressure, many people in the rationality community (and similar groups of contrarians), have come to prize criticism, and willingness to be rude. And beyond that - the ability to see through social reality, to actively distance themselves from it to reduce its power over them (or simply due to aesthetic disgust).</p><p>I earnestly believe those are important things to be able to do especially in the context of a truthseeking community. But I see many people&apos;s attempts as akin Stage 2 of Sarah Constantin&apos;s &quot;<a href=""http://celandine13.livejournal.com/72711.html"">Hierarchy of Requests</a>&quot;:</p><blockquote>Let&apos;s say you&apos;re exhausted; you want to excuse yourself from the group and take a nap.</blockquote><blockquote>In stage 1, you don&apos;t dare ask. Or you don&apos;t understand why you feel shitty, you don&apos;t recognize it as fatigue. You just get more and more upset until you collapse in a heap. In stage 2, you rudely interrupt people in the middle of something important and announce that you&apos;re tired and you&apos;re leaving. In stage 3, you find a convenient moment, apologize for cutting things short, but explain that you&apos;ve got to get some rest. In stage 4, you manage to subtly wrap things up so you can get some rest, without making anyone feel rushed.</blockquote><p>It&apos;s better to be able to rudely criticize than not at all. And for some people, a culture of biting, witty criticism is fun and maybe an important end in-and-of-itself. (Or: a culture of being able to talk about things normally considered taboo can be freeing and be valuable both for the insight and for the human need for freedom/agency). I&apos;ve gotten value out of both of those sorts of cultures.</p><p>But if you&apos;re unable to challenge social reality <em>without</em> brusquely confronting it - or if that is the manner in which you usually do - I think there&apos;s a lot of net-truth you&apos;re leaving on the table.</p><p>There are people who don&apos;t feel safe sharing things when they fear brusque criticism. I think Robby Bensinger summarized the issue compactly: &quot;My own experience is that &apos;sharp culture&apos; makes it more OK to be open about certain things (e.g., anger, disgust, power disparities, disagreements), but less OK to be open about other things (e.g., weakness, pain, fear, loneliness, things that are true but not funny or provocative or badass).&quot;</p><p>Brusque confrontation leads to people buckling down to defend their initial positions because they feel under attack. This can mean less truth gets uncovered and shared.</p><h2>Collaboration vs Criticism For The Sake Of It</h2><p>The job of the critic is much easier than the job of the builder.</p><p>I think that there&apos;s a deeper level productive discussion to be had when people have a shared sense that they are <em>collaboratively building something</em>, as opposed to a dynamic where &quot;one person posts an idea, and then other people post criticisms that tear it down and hopefully the idea is strong enough to survive.&quot; Criticism is an important part of the building process, but I (personally) feel a palpable difference when criticized by someone who shows a clear interest in <em>making sure that something good happens as a result of the conversation.</em></p><p><strong><em>Help Brainstorm Solutions - </em></strong>If you think someone&apos;s goals are good but their approach is wrong, you can put some effort into coming with alternate approaches that you think are more likely to work. If you can&apos;t think of any ways to make it work (and it seems like it&apos;s better to do nothing than to try something that&apos;ll make a situation worse), maybe you can at least talk about some other approaches you considered but still feel inadequate.</p><p><em><strong>Active Listening / Ideological Turning Tests - </strong></em>If you disagree with a person&apos;s <em>goals, </em>you can try to understand why they have those goals, and showcase to them that you at least get where they&apos;re coming from. In my experience people are more willing to listen when they feel they&apos;re being listened to.</p><p>Accompanying criticism with brainstorming and active listening acts as a costly signal, that helps create an atmosphere where it&apos;s a) worth putting in the effort to develop new ideas, and b) easier to realize (and admit) that you&apos;re wrong.</p><h2>Truth As Impact</h2><p>If you constantly water down your truth to make it palatable for the masses, you&apos;ll lose the spark that made that truth valuable. There are downsides to being constantly guarded, worried that a misstep could ruin you. <a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/guardedness-in-ea"">Jeff Kaufman writes</a>:</p><blockquote>There are a lot of benefits to unguarded communication: you can move faster, you can open up your tentative thoughts to friendly consideration and criticism, you don&apos;t have the mental or process overhead of needing to get every statement as perfect as possible. You might say something that you don&apos;t mean to, but in a friendly environment you can correct yourself or accept someone else&apos;s correction.</blockquote><blockquote>Despite these benefits, it seems to me that things generally move in the more guarded direction, at least publicly, as they become more successful.</blockquote><p>Daniel in the comments notes:</p><blockquote>And I think one cost of guardedness that seems missing from the post is that guardedness can bias thinking in favor of more easily palatable and defensible ideas, both in discussions between people as well as one&apos;s own thoughts.</blockquote><blockquote>Unfortunately, I think it&apos;s a natural consequence of growing large and powerful enough to actually affect the big picture: If you&apos;re communicating, not to a few trusted friends but to the entire world, then a verbal misstep will<em> not</em> be something you can easily correct, and the cost may grow from &quot;a few minutes of clarification&quot; to &quot;millions of dollars worth of value lost&quot;.</blockquote><p>I&apos;m not sure how to handle that paradox (Less Wrong is hardly the first group of people to note that PR-speak turns dull and lifeless as organizations grow larger and more established - it seems like an unsolved problem).</p><p>But there&apos;s a difference between watering things down for the masses and speaking guardedly... and learning to communicate in a way that uses other people&apos;s language, that starts from their starting point. </p><p>If you want your clear insights to <em>matter anywhere outside a narrow cluster of contrarians</em>, then at some point you need to figure out how to communicate them so that the rest of the world will listen. Friends who are less contrarian. Customers. Political bodies. The Board of Directors at the company you&apos;ve taken public. </p><p>How to approach this depends on the situation. In some cases, there&apos;s a specific bit of information you want people to have, and if you can successfully communicate that bit then you&apos;re won. In other cases, the one bit doesn&apos;t doing anything in isolation - it only matters if you successfully get people to think clearly about a complex set of ideas. </p><h2>Consider Reversing All Advice You Hear</h2><p>One problem writing this is that there&apos;s a lot of people here, with different goals, methods and styles of communication. Some of them could probably use advice more like: </p><ul><li>&quot;Learn to criticize more kindly/constructively.&quot; </li><li>&quot;Communicate more clearly.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Keep in mind the layers of signals you&apos;re sending when you try to state 1st-order-true-things.&quot;</li></ul><p>And some some could probably use advice more like: </p><ul><li>&quot;Make sure in your efforts to avoid conflict you don&apos;t gloss over important disagreements.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Don&apos;t get so wrapped up in what other people think that you lose the ability to think clearly for yourself.&quot;</li></ul><p>I started writing this post four months ago, as part of the <a href=""https://www.lesserwrong.com/sequences/oyZGWX9WkgWzEDt6M"">Hufflepuff Sequence</a>. Since then, I&apos;ve become much less certain about which elements here are most important to emphasize, and what the risks are of communicating half-baked versions of each of those ideas to different sorts of people. </p><p>But I do still believe that the end-goal for a &quot;true&quot; truth-oriented conversation will need to bear all these elements in mind, one way or another.</p>",Raemon,raemon,Raemon,

<p>This is related to an axis of honesty: whether your words represent your actual state. I suppose because the words most likely to produce the best response naively are often not true. Though I&#8217;m not sure if this is reliably true: feelings in the moment are often misleading, and honesty is often prudent.</p>
<p>Another axis is selfishness versus pro-socialness: whether your actions are meant to produce good outcomes for you (potentially at the expense of others) or a larger group such as the world.</p>
<p>The calculativeness axis seems widely expected match the selfishness axis well. Manipulative people are bad. I don&#8217;t see why they should go together though, in theory. You can say what you feel like in conversation, or say things calculated to achieve goals. Shouldn&#8217;t people saying things to achieve goals do so for all kinds of goals, many venerable? In about the same distribution as people doing other things to achieve goals?</p>
<p>A natural question is whether calculated behavior really is reliably selfish, or whether people just feel like it is for some reason. I can think of cases where it isn&#8217;t selfish. For instance, a diplomat trying to arrange peace is probably choosing their words very carefully, and with regard to consequences. But it is hard to say how rare those are.</p>
<p>Perhaps we just don&#8217;t think of that as being calculative? Or I wonder if we do, and while we like it if peace is arranged, we would still be somewhat wary of a very good diplomat in our own dealings with them. Because even if they are acting for the good of the world, we suspect that it won&#8217;t be for <em>our</em> good, if we are the one being calculated about.</p>
<p>After all, we are presumably being led away from whatever our default choice would have been after hearing the person just represent their internal state as came naturally. And moving away from that sounds probably worse, so more likely that manipulation means to exploit us somehow than to secretly help us get an even better outcome. This is closely related to the honesty axis, and would mean &#8216;manipulative&#8217; doesn&#8217;t really imply &#8216;globally consequentially bad&#8217; so much as &#8216;dangerous to deal with&#8217;.</p>
<p>I am speculating. Are there common positive connotation terms for &#8216;socially manipulative&#8217; or &#8216;calculating&#8217;? Is that a thing people do?</p><br /> ",KatjaGrace,katjagrace,KatjaGrace,

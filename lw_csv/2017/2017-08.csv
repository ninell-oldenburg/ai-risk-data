<p><em><a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1655"">Crossposted</a> at the intelligent agents forum.</em></p>
<p>In <a href=""/lw/891/anthropic_decision_theory_i_sleeping_beauty_and/"">Anthropic Decision Theory</a> (ADT), behaviours that resemble the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-sampling_assumption"">Self Sampling Assumption</a> (SSA) derive from average utilitarian preferences (and from <a href=""/lw/l60/solving_selfishness_for_udt/"">certain specific selfish preferences</a>).</p>
<p>However, SSA implies the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_argument"">doomsday argument</a>, and, to date, I <a href=""/lw/8bw/anthropic_decision_theory_vi_applying_adt_to/"">hadn't</a>&nbsp;<a href=""/lw/mqg/doomsday_argument_for_anthropic_decision_theory/"">found</a> a good way to express the doomsday argument within ADT.</p>
<p>This post will remedy that hole, by showing how there is a natural doomsday-like behaviour for average utilitarian agents within ADT.</p>
<p><a id=""more""></a></p>
<h2>Anthropic behaviour</h2>
<p>The comparable phrasings of the two doomsday arguments (probability and decision-based) are:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the standard doomsday argument, the probability of extinction is increased for an agent that uses SSA probability versus one that doesn't.</li>
<li>In the ADT doomsday argument, an average utilitarian behaves as if it were a total utilitarian with a higher revealed probability of doom.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus in both cases, doomsday agent believes/behaves as if it were a non-doomsday agent with a higher probability of doom.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Revealed probability of events</h3>
<p>What are these <em>revealed probabilities</em>?</p>
<p>Well, suppose that X and X' are two events that may happen. The agent has a choice between betting on one or the other; if they bet on the first, they get a reward of r if X happens, if they bet on the second, they get a reward of r' if X' happens.</p>
<p>If an agent is an expected utility maximiser and chooses X over X', this implies that rP(X) &ge;&nbsp;r'P(X'), where P(X) and P(X') are the probabilities the agent assigns to X and X'.</p>
<p>Thus, observing the behaviour of the agent allows one to deduce their probability estimation for X and X'.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Revealed anthropic and non-anthropic probabilities</h3>
<p>To simplify comparisons, assume that Y is an event that will happen with probability 1; if the agent bets on Y, it will get a reward of 1. The Y's only purpose is to compare with other events.</p>
<p>Then X is an event that will happen with an unknown probability, if bet on, the agent will get a reward of r. In comparison, X<sub>s</sub> is an event that will happen with certainty if and only if humanity survives for a certain amount of time. If the agent bets on X<sub>s</sub> and it happens, it will then give a reward of r<sub>s</sub>.</p>
<p>The agent need to bet on one of Y, X, and X<sub>s</sub>. Suppose that the agent is an average utilitarian, and that their actual estimated probability for human survival is p; thus P(X<sub>s</sub>)=p. If humanity survives, the total human population will be &Omega;; if it doesn't, then it will be limited to &omega;&le;&Omega;.</p>
<p>Then the following table gives the three possible bets and the expected utility the average utilitarian will derive from them. Since the average utilitarian needs to divide their utility by total population, this expected utility will be a function of the probabilities of the different population numbers.</p>
<p>By varying r and r<sub>s</sub>, we can establish what probabilities the agent actually gives to each event, by comparing with situation when it bets of Y. If we did that, but assumed that the agent was a total utilitarian rather than an average one, we would get the apparent revealed probabilities given in the third column:</p>
<table style=""cursor: default;"" border=""3"" align=""center"">

<tr>
<th style=""cursor: text;"">Bet</th><th style=""cursor: text;"">Utility</th><th style=""cursor: text;"">App. rev. prob. if tot.</th>

</tr>
<tr>
<th style=""cursor: text;"">X</th>
<td style=""color: #000000; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; cursor: text; margin: 8px;"" align=""center"">&nbsp;rP(X)[(1-p)/&omega; + p/&Omega;]&nbsp;</td>
<td style=""color: #000000; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; cursor: text; margin: 8px;"" align=""center"">P(X)<br /></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th style=""cursor: text;"">X<sub>s</sub><br /></th>
<td style=""color: #000000; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; cursor: text; margin: 8px;"" align=""center"">r<sub>s</sub>(p/&Omega;)</td>
<td style=""color: #000000; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; cursor: text; margin: 8px;"" align=""center"">&nbsp;p'= (p/&Omega;) / [(1-p)/&omega; + p/&Omega;]&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Note that if &Omega;=&omega;&nbsp;- if the population is fixed, so that the average utilitarian behaves the same as a total utilitarian - then p' simplifies to (p/&omega;) / (1/&omega;) = p, the actual probability of survival.</p>
<p>It's also not hard to see that p' strictly decreases as &Omega;&nbsp;increases, so it will always be less than p if &Omega;&nbsp;&gt; &omega;.</p>
<p>Thus if we interpret the actions of an average utilitarian as if they were a total utilitarian, then for reward conditional on human survival - and <strong>only</strong> for those rewards, not for others like betting on X - their actions will seem to imply that they give a lower probability of human survival than they actually do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The standard doomsday argument argues that we are more likely to be in the first 50% of the list of all humans that will ever live, rather than in the first 10%, which is still more likely than us being in the first 1%, and so on. The argument is also vulnerable to changes of reference class; it gives different implications if we consider 'the list of all humans', 'the list of all mammals', or 'the list of all people with my name'. The doomsday argument has no effect on probabilities not connected with human survival.</p>
<p>All these effects reproduce in this new framework. Being in the first n% means that the total human population will be at least &omega;100/n, so the total population &Omega;&nbsp;grows as n shrinks -- and p', the apparent revealed probability of survival, shrinks as well. Similarly, average utilitarianism gives different answers depending on what reference class is used to define its population. And the apparent revealed probabilities that are not connected with human survival are unchanged from a total utilitarian.</p>
<p>Thus this seems like a very close replication of the doomsday argument in ADT, in terms of behaviour and apparent revealed probabilities. But note that it is not a genuine doomsday argument. It's all due to the quirky nature of average utilitarianism; the agent doesn't really <em>believe</em> that the probability of survival goes down, they just behave in a way that would make us infer that they believed that, if we saw them as being a total utilitarian. So there is no actual increased risk.</p>",Stuart_Armstrong,stuart_armstrong,Stuart_Armstrong,

</style></head><body><p>In <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/891/anthropic_decision_theory_i_sleeping_beauty_and/"">Anthropic Decision Theory</a> (ADT), behaviours that resemble the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-sampling_assumption"">Self Sampling Assumption</a> (SSA) derive from average utilitarian preferences (and from <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/l60/solving_selfishness_for_udt/"">certain specific selfish preferences</a>).</p>
<p>However, SSA implies the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_argument"">doomsday argument</a>, and, to date, I <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/8bw/anthropic_decision_theory_vi_applying_adt_to/"">hadn't</a> <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/mqg/doomsday_argument_for_anthropic_decision_theory/"">found</a> a good way to express the doomsday argument within ADT.</p>
<p>This post will remedy that hole, by showing how there is a natural doomsday-like behaviour for average utilitarian agents within ADT.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Anthropic behaviour</h2>
<p>The comparable phrasings of the two doomsday arguments (probability and decision-based) are:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the standard doomsday argument, the probability of extinction is increased for an agent that uses SSA probability versus one that doesn't.</li>
<li>In the ADT doomsday argument, an average utilitarian behaves as if it were a total utilitarian with a higher revealed probability of doom.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus in both cases, doomsday agent believes/behaves as if it were a non-doomsday agent with a higher probability of doom.</p>

<p>The standard doomsday argument argues that we are more likely to be in the first <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""50\%""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mn""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">50</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">%</span></span></span></span></span></span> of the list of all humans that will ever live, rather than in the first <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""10\%""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mn""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">10</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">%</span></span></span></span></span></span>, which is still more likely than us being in the first <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""1\%""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mn""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">1</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">%</span></span></span></span></span></span>, and so on. The argument is also vulnerable to changes of reference class; it gives different implications if we consider 'the list of all humans', 'the list of all mammals', or 'the list of all people with my name'. The doomsday argument has no effect on probabilities not connected with human survival.</p>

Similarly, average utilitarianism gives different answers depending on what reference class is used to define its population. And the apparent revealed probabilities that are not connected with human survival are unchanged from a total utilitarian.</p>
<p>Thus this seems like a very close replication of the doomsday argument in ADT, in terms of behaviour and apparent revealed probabilities. But note that it is not a genuine doomsday argument. It's all due to the quirky nature of average utilitarianism; the agent doesn't really <em>believe</em> that the probability of survival goes down, they just behave in a way that would make us infer that they believed that, if we saw them as being a total utilitarian. So there is no actual increased risk.</p>

QZWgxin3PXvrmb5dx,What you can’t say to a sympathetic ear,what-you-can-t-say-to-a-sympathetic-ear,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/QZWgxin3PXvrmb5dx/what-you-can-t-say-to-a-sympathetic-ear,2017-08-31T00:05:30.000Z,9,4,1,False,False,,"<p>Suppose we live in a society where it <a href=""http://paulgraham.com/say.html"">is strongly frowned upon</a> to believe that an onion is a fruit. It is ok to disagree about what defines &#8216;fruit&#8217;, or what <em>Allium</em> varieties are onions. But none of this will get you off the hook—you had just better not suggest that an onions is a fruit.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t think about the issue much yourself. If you had to, you would probably agree with the consensus view that the onion is not a fruit, given a few clarifications of the question. If you were allowed, you would probably admit that you don&#8217;t care much about the question. And that you would kind of prefer that it was possible to discuss the issue calmly and without accusations of transcendent evil.</p>
<p>However none of these things is relevant in the real world, because you daren&#8217;t even advocate for calmer consideration of the onion classification issue. People would infer that (in a sense) you don&#8217;t want to punish people who say that an onion is a fruit. And (in a different sense) not punishing it is much like endorsing it. Punishing non-punishers is an important part of cooperation.</p>
<p>Now suppose you and I are chatting over lunch in a work cafeteria, and I glance furtively around and then lean over to you with gleaming eyes, and whisper that I am making fruit soup tonight, and ahem, there are many people who would cry if they watched me cutting up the fruit for it.</p>
<p>You see what I&#8217;m saying. Nobody else seems to have heard.  Are you annoyed? Do you think worse of me?</p>
<p>My guess is yes, at least quite plausibly.</p>
<p>And you are not annoyed because you find my comments troubling in their own right. You disagree with them, but don&#8217;t find them intrinsically offensive. Outside the context of our society, you wouldn&#8217;t mind.</p>
<p>You <a href=""https://meteuphoric.wordpress.com/2016/07/14/iterations-of-hurt/"">might be</a> offended that I am willing to suggest an onion is a fruit in your presence in spite of knowing that most people would be unhappy about this. But suppose that we know each other well, and you know I know you are hard to hurt, even with grievous categorization errors.</p>
<p>I think you still have a strong reason to be annoyed. Which is that I am intentionally taking an action that the rest of the world thinks you are strongly obliged to punish—for instance, by threatening to stop associating with me unless I have an amazing excuse for what kind of seizure took over my mouth. Which means you must decide on the spot whether to punish me (at a cost to our relationship) or implicitly collude a bit with my renegade controversial-thing-saying faction. At a cost to your relationship with the world, because if they learned of this, they would hate you.</p>
<p>This makes my implied classification of onions as fruit into an ultimatum: &#8216;Me or the rest of society?&#8217; If it is intentional, then it is a test of our friendship, at your expense. It&#8217;s like randomly saying &#8216;ok, if you really care about our friendship then steal $10 from your grandmother to prove it&#8217;.</p>
<p>Saying that onions are fruit quietly to you is holding our friendship hostage unless you shift your alliances away from the rest of the world and toward me. Or, more likely, it is an accident that still puts you in this position.</p>
<p>And it is very annoying to have your valuables taken hostage, and even more annoying to be threatened on short notice, with a deadline, so that you can&#8217;t just put it at the bottom of your to-do list and deal with it another time.</p>
<p>I hadn&#8217;t explicitly noticed that this kind of dynamic existed before (and it may not), but I think it might play a large part in my own feelings, on both sides of situations that are a bit like this.</p>
<p>I am sometimes annoyed when people reveal disagreeable views to me, even if I don&#8217;t especially disagree with them. Which is a bit surprising, on the face of it. And other times, I find myself in the position of wanting to say things that may sound controversial, and feeling hesitant, in part for the other person&#8217;s sake. So I got to thinking about the possible ways that could harm someone. And imagining myself in their shoes, this is the kind of harm I expected. I have not much idea if others feel the same way in these circumstances, or would construe the situation similarly in terms of game theory.</p>
<p>This might all seem pretty unimportant, being as it is a speculative and hand-wavey analysis of an already obscure social situation. But the existence of multiple reasons to be offended by officially offensive statements—even if you are sympathetic to them—means that social bans on views should be more stable than you might think. It&#8217;s one of those things where even if everyone comes to privately believe that onions are indeed fruit, and also thinks that nobody should be punished for saying this, <em>and they can all talk to each other</em>, everyone might still end up saying that onions aren&#8217;t fruit forever.</p>
<p>This means sanctions on speech aren&#8217;t just costly because they make it hard for individuals to hear ideas that might turn out to be true. They are more costly than that, because even if every individual manages to hear the ideas, and they are good, still they might not be able to update their behavior or the social consensus. And if everyone has to talk and behave as if a claim is false, we have lost a lot of the value of knowing that it is true.</p>
<p>To successfully condemn a view socially is to lock that view in place with a coordination problem. We could all freely identify onions as we wanted, but we have to all at once decide to change the norms, or else we get punished. And changing the norms would be hard to arrange at the best of times, but is harder when trying to arrange it warrants punishment.</p>
<p>If this analysis is correct, I think this situation should raise the bar for condemning views, because it makes it even harder for future people to undo our mistakes where we have erred. Condemnation is more permanent.</p>
<p>ETA Sept 3 2017: I am on reflection happy for people to tell me their controversial views if they are interesting—I bring up my slight feeling of annoyance about it as evidence that it is imposing some cost. But I am usually willing to pay the cost.</p><br />  <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/12672/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/12672/"" /></a> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/12672/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/delicious/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/12672/"" /></a> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gofacebook/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/12672/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/facebook/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/12672/"" /></a> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gotwitter/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/12672/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/twitter/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/12672/"" /></a> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/12672/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/stumble/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/12672/"" /></a> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/12672/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/digg/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/12672/"" /></a> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/12672/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/reddit/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/12672/"" /></a> <img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=meteuphoric.wordpress.com&#038;blog=8643840&#038;post=12672&#038;subd=meteuphoric&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1"" width=""1"" height=""1"" />",KatjaGrace,katjagrace,KatjaGrace,

I just went to <a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/08/16/fear-and-loathing-at-effective-altruism-global-2017/"">this year&#8217;s</a>, which reminds me I should post it. In good news, I am not writing about how to get around to things.</p>
<p>Many Effective Altruists are trying to do things that are really good with their lives, and EA Global can be an exciting time for hashing out which things those should be. Which brings to the fore some issues with doing this.</p>
<p>It is hard to have good plans for creating large amounts of value in the world, especially if you are an ignorant young person. Happily, lots of people know different things to one another, including many that are relevant to the probable success of everyone&#8217;s plans. Unhappily, exchanging this information can be somewhat fraught.</p>
<p><strong>How things go wrong</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>1. The attack</strong></em></p>
<p>One kind of bad thing that can happen is Ann says &#8216;I am starting a student group for minority square dancers because I think it will change the values of the future artificial arachnid civilization that arises in our place&#8217; and everyone else thinks, &#8216;Oh boy, I know the correct answer to this one&#8217; and they all jump in and helpfully explain that Ann&#8217;s plan is terrible in almost every way, and Ann is sad, and maybe thinks she shouldn&#8217;t hang out with these people anyway.</p>
<p>There is also a much milder version of this, where Ann says &#8216;I am starting a student group for open borders&#8217; and Ben argues that open borders might not be <em>that</em> good, and that he thinks it probably isn&#8217;t the best thing to fight for. And Ann agrees in principle that it is good to discuss these things, but she admittedly still feels kind of sad about Ben&#8217;s willingness to criticize and oppose her, and it makes their friendship a bit worse.</p>
<p><em><strong>2. The polite sidestep</strong></em></p>
<p>I am not sure if #1 actually happens. Probably the milder version does, but I don&#8217;t remember seeing it much. A different kind of bad thing seems more common. Clara says &#8216;I&#8217;m going to work at Startup.io and earn money to give to my favorite EA cause—Raising Awareness About Goodness—and at the same time, I&#8217;ll be directly improving the lives of thousands of children somehow&#8217;. And Dora and Eloise and Freda would not have this plan themselves in a fit, because they can see many reasons it probably won&#8217;t work. They have heard bad things about Startup.io, and they think RAAG is going to receive more money than it knows what to do with from other sources and is bottlenecked on talent more, and they can think of numerous impediments to the bettering of thousands of children&#8217;s lives occurring amidst all this. However they are polite and friendly, so they don&#8217;t say any of that, and instead say &#8216;Oh, um, great, that&#8217;s very virtuous of you&#8217; and ask if she is looking forward to having a shorter commute.</p>
<p><em><strong>3. The inadvertent personal question</strong></em></p>
<p>I saw a third kind of bad outcome at EA Global last time, which was sometimes my own fault. My conversation partner would have views on what it would be strategic for me to do. For instance, to give a talk at EA Global. (I was in a good position to decide to give a talk at the last minute, because there was one in the program with my name on it). So they would suggest this. But my reasons for not giving a talk were not just a person-neutral evaluation of giving talks. They included relatively personal considerations, such as my then high proclivity to anxiety attacks, and my lack of knowledge about how to gracefully flee an auditorium from an initial position of center stage.</p>
<p>Psychological health issues and embarrassing personal fleeing strategy deficiencies are more personal topics than my conversation partner was probably meaning to be asking me about, so this might have been awkward for them.</p>
<p>Furthermore, they aren&#8217;t topics that those people have particular expertise on, so it was also unfortunate if we missed an opportunity for them to give me any unique knowledge they have about why giving talks is generally so great.</p>
<p>This particular case is perhaps not a usual problem, because people are usually more given to polite evasiveness than me. And it it wasn&#8217;t so bad. But it is a real example that is my own to discuss.</p>
<p>Here is a fictional example where it is a more central issue. Gretel joins the conversation about Clara&#8217;s move to Startup.io late. She says that while many people should be thrilled to be at Startup.io, she thinks Clara is especially talented and could do better. She suggests Clara consider doing good more directly, perhaps in biotechnology. She suggests some specific places where she knows people.</p>
<p>In fact, Clara agrees that there are probably higher value careers in the abstract, and that biotechnology would be a much better fit for some sort of stylized Clara. But she wants to be at Startup.io much more than she wants to try to start a career in biotechnology, for several reasons. Firstly, she feels like she can&#8217;t do anything at all except pass tests, and longs for even just a few months where she gets to put in effort and have undeniable value come out. Relatedly, she would like her family to know she has this power, even if she ultimately chooses not to use it. Third, she knows her husband is unhappy here, and so they might want to move, and the Startup job is fine to do for a short time, and allows for remote work. Plus, she sort of hates being around everyone in biotech—including some people in this room—for reasons she can&#8217;t put a finger on. And if she has to spend every day being told what to do by them, then she suspects she will also spend every day imagining killing them, which will be a distraction, and also kind of worrying.</p>
<p>Probably none of these things will make for mutually enjoyable or informative conversation, since Clara already knows more about these issues than the others, and while the others would not be bored hearing some of the human-interest details, their enjoyment would probably be at the expense of Clara&#8217;s, especially in the overall context of defending her apparently poor choices.</p>
<p>In general, people&#8217;s decisions about what to do with their lives factor in many details of their lives, which are often personal. If you ask why a person is doing something that doesn&#8217;t seem effective to you, the answer can easily be &#8216;I am not motivated to do anything unless it is located within five miles of this particular human&#8217;, or &#8216;I find moral motivations utterly demoralizing, so I really have to do something that I don&#8217;t consider overwhelmingly important, and then redirect earnings to something good after the fact&#8217; or &#8216;Thinking about the most effective thing is stressful and hard, so I can only do it for an hour per month, and I&#8217;m up to the bit where I give some money to a reasonable charity&#8217;. Which are perhaps interesting topics for discussion if both parties want to, but since they sometimes don&#8217;t—either because it&#8217;s uncomfortable, or because there are more interesting things to discuss—it can be bad to end up there accidentally.</p>
<p>I think people often recognize that it is bad to end up in these places accidentally, which often takes them back to a different version of #2.</p>
<p><strong>Proposed improvement</strong></p>
<p>Of these problems, my guess is that #2 is by far the most directly destructive problem for the world, but that #2 is largely caused by fear of landing in #1 or #3, which are locally socially destructive. So it seems worth addressing fear of #1 and #3, possibly by addressing #1 and #3.</p>
<p>I have one speculative suggestion for this kind of situation, which I haven&#8217;t actually tested much, but I keep forgetting to, so I&#8217;m just going to suggest it: debate beliefs, not actions.</p>
<p>For example, if your conversation partner says they are going to grad school in philosophy, and you think this is a bad idea, instead of saying &#8216;that sounds ineffective&#8217; or &#8216;oh, cool, philosophy is interesting&#8217;, you should ask about the factual questions that you think you and they might disagree on. For instance, &#8216;do you think there are high impact questions to answer in philosophy?&#8217; or &#8216;do you think there will be jobs available in it, or is it more of a high-risk high-reward bet?&#8217;</p>
<p>This should help in avoiding #1 because debating a question that is indirectly related to the other person&#8217;s choices is less aggressive than debating their choices. And it should help in avoiding #3 because asking about one of the general facts informing their choice, rather than their choice, removes the need to bring up the other more personal facts informing it. My hope is that this makes it possible to talk about such things at all with fewer costs, and so to avoid #2.</p>
<p>On top of that, it means you get to talk more about factual questions of broad relevance, which are arguably more valuable to establish truth about. For instance, it is better to know whether giving talks tends to be helpful in general than it is to establish whether I personally will be able to give a good talk today.</p><br />  <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/12328/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/12328/"" /></a> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/12328/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/delicious/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/12328/"" /></a> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gofacebook/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/12328/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/facebook/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/12328/"" /></a> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gotwitter/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/12328/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/twitter/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/12328/"" /></a> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/12328/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/stumble/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/12328/"" /></a> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/12328/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/digg/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/12328/"" /></a> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/12328/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/reddit/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/12328/"" /></a> <img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=meteuphoric.wordpress.com&#038;blog=8643840&#038;post=12328&#038;subd=meteuphoric&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1"" width=""1"" height=""1"" />",KatjaGrace,katjagrace,KatjaGrace,

<p>I give an account for why some properties seem intrinsic while others seem extrinsic. In light of this account, the property of moral goodness seems intrinsic in one way and extrinsic in another. Most properties do not suffer from this ambiguity. I suggest that this is why many people find Eliezer's <a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Metaethics_sequence"">metaethics</a> to be confusing.</p>
<h4>Section 1: Intuitions of intrinsicness<br /></h4>
<p>What makes a particular property seem more or less <em>intrinsic</em>, as opposed to <em>extrinsic</em>?</p>
<p>Consider the following three properties that a physical object <em>X</em> might have:</p>
<ol>
<li>The property of having the shape of a regular triangular. (I'll call this property ""∆-ness"" or ""being ∆-shaped"", for short.)</li>
<li>The property of being hard, in the sense of resisting deformation.</li>
<li>The property of being a key that can open a particular lock <em>L</em> (or <em>L</em>-opening-ness).</li>
</ol>
<p>To me, intuitively, ∆-ness seems entirely intrinsic, and hardness seems somewhat less intrinsic, but still very intrinsic. However, the property of opening a particular lock seems very extrinsic. (If the notion of ""intrinsic"" seems meaningless to you, please keep reading. I believe that I ground these intuitions in something meaningful below.)</p>
<p>When I query my intuition on these examples, it elaborates as follows:</p>
<p>(1) If an object <em>X</em> is ∆-shaped, then <em>X</em> is ∆-shaped <em>independently of any consideration of anything else</em>. Object <em>X</em> could manifest its ∆-ness even in perfect isolation, in a universe that contained no other objects. In that sense, being ∆-shaped is intrinsic to <em>X</em>.</p>
<p>(2) If an object <em>X</em> is hard, then that fact does have a whiff of extrinsicness about it. After all, <em>X</em>'s being hard is typically apparent only in an interaction between <em>X</em> and some other object <em>Y</em>, such as in a forceful collision after which the parts of <em>X</em> are still in nearly the same arrangement.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, <em>X</em>'s hardness still feels to me to be primarily ""in""<em> X</em>. Yes, something else has to be brought onto the scene for <em>X</em>'s hardness to do anything. That is, <em>X</em>'s hardness can be detected only with the help of some ""test object"" <em>Y</em> (to bounce off of <em>X</em>, for example). Nonetheless, the hardness detected is intrinsic to <em>X</em>. It is not, for example, primarily a fact about the system consisting of <em>X</em> and the test object <em>Y</em> together.</p>
<p>(3) Being an <em>L</em>-opening key (where <em>L</em> is a particular lock), on the other hand, feels very extrinsic to me. A thought experiment that pumps this intuition for me is this: Imagine a molten blob <em>K</em> of metal shifting through a range of key-shapes. The vast majority of such shapes do not open <em>L</em>. Now suppose that, in the course of these metamorphoses, <em>K</em> happens to pass through a shape that does open <em>L</em>. Just for that instant, <em>K</em> takes on the property of <em>L</em>-opening-ness. Nonetheless, and here is the point, an observer without detailed knowledge of <em>L</em> <em>in particular</em> wouldn't notice anything special about that instant.</p>
<p>Contrast this with the other two properties: An observer of three dots moving in space might notice when those three dots happen to fall into the configuration of a regular triangle. And an observer of an object passing through different conditions of hardness might notice when the object has become particularly hard. The observer can use a generic test object <em>Y</em> to check the hardness of <em>X</em>. The observer doesn't need anything <em>in particular</em> to notice that <em>X</em> has become hard.</p>
<p>But all that is just an elaboration of my intuitions. What is really going on here? I think that the answer sheds light on how people understand Eliezer's metaethics.</p>
<h4>Section 2: Is goodness intrinsic?<br /></h4>
<p>I was led to this line of thinking while trying to understand why Eliezer's metaethics is <a href=""/lw/435/what_is_eliezer_yudkowskys_metaethical_theory/"">consistently confusing</a>.</p>
<p>The notion of an <em>L</em>-opening key has been my personal go-to analogy for thinking about how <em>goodness</em> (of a state of affairs) can be objective, as opposed to subjective. The analogy works like this: We are like locks, and states of affairs are like keys. Roughly, a state is <em>good</em> when it engages our moral sensibilities so that, upon reflection, we favor that state. Speaking metaphorically, a state is good just when it has the right shape to ""open"" us. (Here, ""us"" means normal human beings as we are in the actual world.) Being of the right shape to open a particular lock is an objective fact about a key. Analogously, being good is an objective fact about a state of affairs.</p>
<p>Objective in what sense? In this important sense, at least: The property of <em>being L-opening</em> picks out a particular point in key-shape space<sup>1</sup>. This space contains a point for every possible key-shape, even if no existing key has that shape. So we can say that a hypothetical key is ""of an <em>L</em>-opening shape"" even if the key is assumed to exist in a world that has no locks of type <em>L</em>. Analogously, a state can still be called good even if it is in a counterfactual world containing no agents who share our moral sensibilities.</p>
<p>But the discussion in Section 1 made ""being <em>L</em>-opening"" seem, while objective, very extrinsic, and not primarily about the key <em>K</em> itself. The analogy between ""<em>L</em>-opening-ness"" and goodness seems to work against Eliezer's purposes. It suggests that goodness is extrinsic, rather than intrinsic. For, one cannot properly call a key ""opening"" in general. One can only say that a key ""opens this or that particular lock"". But the analogous claim about goodness sounds like relativism: ""There's no objective fact of the matter about whether a state of affairs is <em>good</em>. There's just an objective fact of the matter about whether it is good <em>to you</em>.""</p>
<p>This, I suppose, is why some people think that Eliezer's metaethics is just warmed-over relativism, despite <a href=""/lw/t3/the_bedrock_of_morality_arbitrary/"">his protestations</a>.</p>
<h4>Section 3: Seeing intrinsicness in simulations<br /></h4>
<p>I think that we can account for the intuitions of intrinsicness in Section 1 by looking at them from the perspective <em>simulations</em>. Moreover, this account will explain why some of us (including perhaps Eliezer) judge goodness to be intrinsic.</p>
<p>The main idea is this: In our minds, a property <em>P</em>, among other things, ""points to"" the test for its presence. In particular, <em>P</em> evokes whatever would be involved in detecting the presence of <em>P</em>. Whether I consider a property <em>P</em> to be intrinsic depends on how I would test for the presence of <em>P &mdash;</em> NOT, however, on how I would test for <em>P</em> ""in the real world"", but rather on<strong> </strong>how I would test for <em>P</em><strong> <em>in a simulation</em><em> that I'm observing from the outside</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Here is how this plays out in the cases above.</p>
<p>(1) In the case of being ∆-shaped, consider a simulation (on a computer, or in your mind's eye) consisting of three points connected by straight lines to make a triangle <em>X</em> floating in space. The points move around, and the straight lines stretch and change direction to keep the points connected. The simulation itself just keeps track of where the points and lines are. Nonetheless, when <em>X</em> becomes ∆-shaped, I notice this ""directly"", from outside the simulation. Nothing else within the simulation needs to react to the ∆-ness. Indeed, nothing else needs to be there at all, aside from the points and lines. The ∆-shape detector is in <em>me</em>, outside the simulation. To make the ∆-ness of an object <em>X</em> manifest, the simulation needs to contain only the object <em>X</em> itself.</p>
<p>In summary: A property will feel extremely intrinsic to <em>X</em> when my detecting the property requires only this: ""Simulate just <em>X</em>.""</p>
<p>(2) For the case of hardness, imagine a computer simulation that models matter and its motions as they follow from the laws of physics and my exogenous manipulations. The simulation keeps track of only fundamental forces, individual molecules, and their positions and momenta. But I can see on the computer display what the resulting clumps of matter look like. In particular, there is a clump <em>X</em> of matter in the simulation, and I can ask myself whether <em>X</em> is hard.</p>
<p>Now, on the one hand, I am not <em>myself</em> a hardness detector that can just look at <em>X</em> and see its hardness. In that sense, hardness is different from ∆-ness, which I can just look at and see. In this case, I need to build a hardness detector. Moreover, I need to build the detector <em>inside the simulation</em>. I need some other thing <em>Y</em> in the simulation to bounce off of <em>X</em> to see whether <em>X</em> is hard. Then I, outside the simulation, can say, ""Yup, the way <em>Y</em> bounced off of <em>X</em> indicates that <em>X</em> is hard."" (The simulation itself isn't generating statements like ""<em>X</em> is hard"", any more than the 3-points-and-lines simulation above was generating statements about whether the configuration was a regular triangle.)</p>
<p>On the other hand, crucially, I can detect hardness with practically <em>anything at all</em> in addition to <em>X</em> in the simulation. I can take practically any old chunk of molecules and bounce it off of <em>X</em> with sufficient force.</p>
<p>A property of an object <em>X</em> still feels intrinsic when detecting the property requires only this: ""Simulate just <em>X</em> + practically any other arbitrary thing.""</p>
<p>Indeed, perhaps I need only an arbitrarily small ""epsilon"" chunk of additional stuff inside the simulation. Given such a chunk, I can run the simulation to knock the chunk against <em>X</em>, perhaps from various directions. Then I can assess the results to conclude whether <em>X</em> is hard. The sense of intrinsicness comes, perhaps, from ""taking the limit as epsilon goes to 0"", seeing the hardness there the whole time, and interpreting this as saying that the hardness is ""within"" <em>X</em> itself.</p>
<p>In summary: A property will feel very intrinsic to <em>X</em> when its detection requires only this: ""Simulate just <em>X</em> + epsilon.""</p>
<p>(3) In this light, <em>L</em>-opening keys differ crucially from ∆-shaped things and from hard things.</p>
<p>An <em>L</em>-opening key differs from an ∆-shaped object because I myself do not encode lock <em>L</em>. Whereas I can look at a regular triangle and see its ∆-ness from outside the simulation, I cannot do the same (let's suppose) for keys of the right shape to open lock <em>L</em>. So I cannot simulate a key <em>K</em> alone and see its <em>L</em>-opening-ness.</p>
<p>Moreover, I cannot add something merely arbitrary to the simulation to check <em>K</em> for <em>L</em>-opening-ness.&nbsp; I need to build something very precise and complicated inside the simulation: an instance of the lock <em>L</em>. Then I can insert <em>K</em> in the lock and observe whether it opens.</p>
<p>I need, not just <em>K</em>, and not just <em>K</em> + epsilon: I need to simulate <em>K</em> + <em>something complicated in particular</em>.</p>
<h4><strong>Section 4: Back to goodness</strong><br /></h4>
<p>So how does goodness as a property fit into this story?</p>
<p>There is an important sense in which goodness is more like being ∆-shaped than it is like being <em>L</em>-opening. Namely, goodness of a state of affairs is something that I can assess myself from outside a simulation of that state. I don't need to simulate anything else to see it. Putting it another way, goodness is like <em>L</em>-opening would be if I happened myself to encode lock <em>L</em>. If that were the case, then, as soon as I saw <em>K</em> take on the right shape inside the simulation, that shape could ""click"" with me outside of the simulation.</p>
<p>That is why goodness seems to have the same ultimate kind of intrinsicness that ∆-ness has and which being <em>L</em>-opening lacks. We don't encode locks, but we do encode morality.</p>

You are also told that over the past year, a total of 1 billion people have been in room Y at one time or another whereas only 10,000 people have been in room X. There is no way of communicating with anyone else, so you must use the information given to guess which room you&rsquo;re in. If you guess correctly, you win 1 million dollars. The question here is: Does the extra information about the past histories of rooms X and Y change your mind about which room you&rsquo;re in? It shouldn&rsquo;t.

In contrast, the only relevant information in the third scenario is diachronic information about which of the two rooms had more people pass through them from T1 to T2.

The third disjunct entails that we would almost certainly live in a computer simulation because (a) a sufficiently high-resolution simulation would be sensorily and phenomenologically indistinguishable from the &ldquo;real&rdquo; world, and (b) the indifference principle tells us to distribute our probabilities evenly among all the possibilities if we have no special reason to favor one over another.

(This could be accomplished by running simulations at speeds much faster than realtime.) If the question is, &ldquo;Where am I right now, in a simulation or not?,&rdquo; then the principle of indifference instructs you to answer, &ldquo;I am not a sim.&rdquo; After all, if everyone were to bet at some timeslice Tx that they are not a sim, nearly everyone would win.</span><br style=""color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif;"" /><br style=""color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif;"" /><span style=""color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif;"">Here the only information that matters is synchronic information; diachronic information about how many sims, non-sims, or &ldquo;observer-moments&rdquo; there have been has no bearing on one&rsquo;s credence about one&rsquo;s present ontological status (sim or non-sim?)&mdash;that is, no more than historical knowledge about rooms X and Y in Scenario 2 have any bearing on one&rsquo;s response to the question, &ldquo;Which room am I currently in?&rdquo; This is problematic for the simulation argument because the Posthuman Future outlined above satisfies the condition of disjunct (iii) yet it doesn&rsquo;t entail that one is almost certainly living in a simulation.

Even more, if we were to stop all simulations, then the ratio of sims to non-sims would be zero to whatever the human population is at the time, thus making a bet that we are non-sims virtually certain.

It's obvious we all need to do this because it's in our best interest to harmonize with natural or social cycles for our well-being. But here is the trick!

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>In&nbsp;<a href=""/lw/mo/infinite_certainty/"">infinite certainty</a>, Eliezer makes the argument that you can't ever be absolutely sure of a proposition. That is an argument I disagreed with for a long time, but due to Akrasia acedia, I never got around to writing it. I think I have a more coherent counter argument now, and would present it below. Because the post I am replying to and&nbsp;<a href=""/lw/mo/infinite_certainty/"">infinite certainty</a>&nbsp;are linked, I address both of them in this post.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 1em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: justify;"">This doesn't mean, though, that I have&nbsp;<em>absolute confidence</em>&nbsp;that 2 + 2 = 4.&nbsp; See the previous discussion on&nbsp;<a style=""color: #8a8a8b;"" href=""/lw/jr/how_to_convince_me_that_2_2_3/"">how to convince me that 2 + 2 = 3</a>, which could be done using much the same sort of evidence that convinced me that 2 + 2 = 4 in the first place.&nbsp; I could have hallucinated all that previous evidence, or I could be misremembering it.&nbsp; In the annals of neurology there are stranger brain dysfunctions than this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 1em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: justify;"">This is true. That a statement is true does not mean that you have absolute confidence in the veracity of the statement. It is possible that you may have hallucinated everything.</p>

<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 1em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: justify;"">Suppose you say that you're 99.99% confident that 2 + 2 = 4.&nbsp; Then you have just asserted that you could make 10,000&nbsp;<em>independent&nbsp;</em>statements, in which you repose equal confidence, and be wrong, on average, around once.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 1em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: justify;"">I am not so sure of this. If I have X% confidence in a belief, and I am well calibrated, then if there were K statements for which I said I have X% confidence in, then you expect that ((100-X)/100)*K of those statements would be wrong, and the remainder would be right. It does not follow that if I have X% confidence in a belief that I can make K statements in which I repose equal confidence, and be wrong only ((100-X)/100)*K&nbsp;&nbsp;times.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 1em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: justify;"">It's something like X% confidence (implies) if you made K statements then ((100-X)/100)*K of those statements would be wrong.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 1em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: justify;"">A well calibrated agent does not have to be able to make K with only ((100-X)/100)*K&nbsp;&nbsp;wrong those statements for them to possess X% confidence in the proposition. It only indicates that in a hypothetical world in which they did make K statements, if they were well calibrated, only ((100-X)/100)*K &nbsp;of those statements would be wrong. To assert that a well calibrated agent must be able to make those statements before they can have X% confidence, is to establish the hypothetical as a given fact&mdash;either a honest mistake, or deliberate malice. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

This means that the proposition ""I exist"" exists (pun intended) in my mental map of the world, and is therefore a belief of mine. By deduction, if I assign a probability of 1 to the statement ""I exist"", then I must assign a probability of 1 to the proposition ""I believe that I exist"".

<blockquote>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 1em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: justify;"">So I propose that it makes sense to say that 1 and 0 are not in the probabilities; just as negative and positive infinity, which do not obey the field axioms, are not in the real numbers.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 1em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: justify;"">The main reason this would upset probability theorists is that we would need to rederive theorems previously obtained by assuming that we can marginalize over a joint probability by adding up all the pieces and having them sum to 1.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 1em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: justify;"">However, in the real world, when you roll a die, it doesn't literally have&nbsp;<a style=""color: #8a8a8b;"" href=""/lw/mo/infinite_certainty/"">infinite certainty</a>&nbsp;of coming up some number between 1 and 6.&nbsp; The die might land on its edge; or get struck by a meteor; or the Dark Lords of the Matrix might reach in and write ""37"" on one side.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 1em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: justify;"">If you made a magical symbol to stand for ""all possibilities I haven't considered"", then you could marginalize over the events including this magical symbol, and arrive at a magical symbol ""T"" that stands for infinite certainty.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 1em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: justify;"">But I would rather ask whether there's some way to derive a theorem without using magic symbols with special behaviors.&nbsp; That would be more elegant.&nbsp; Just as there are mathematicians who refuse to believe in double negation or infinite sets, I would like to be a probability theorist who doesn't believe in absolute certainty.</p>

The other 10 hours I spent thinking about <a href=""https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2017/08/17/the-premium-mediocre-life-of-maya-millennial/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">The Premium Mediocre Life of Maya Millenial</a>.</p>
<p>Like all essays by Venkat, this one is optimized for getting you to think about it. Venkat achieves it by precisely crafting his writing to be 60% true, 30% wrong and 10% nonsensical. But the true 60% of <em>Premium Mediocre</em> is deeply and importantly true, and also really fun to read. It&#8217;s a long essay and I&#8217;ll quote liberally from it, but if you are only going to read my post <em>or</em> the original, <a href=""https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2017/08/17/the-premium-mediocre-life-of-maya-millennial/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">go read the original</a>.</p>
<p>The wrong 30% is there to be interestingly wrong, and also to focus the attention on the true parts. If 5% of an argument is wrong, readers will nitpick that 5% to death. This has always been a huge source of frustration on LessWrong. If an argument is 30% wrong but 100% inspiring, no one cares about nitpicking errors.</p>
<p>And yet, I&#8217;m going to mostly focus on the 30% that Venkat missed so that those who read both essays can understand better the core reality of premium mediocrity.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re curious, Putanumonit is 75% true and 25% stupid. This ratio is the result of my writing about topics at the edge of my expertise. For example, I know a lot about <a href=""http://putanumonit.com/2017/08/16/take-my-job/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">financial regulation</a> and a little about economic inequality. I&#8217;m only going to <a href=""https://putanumonit.com/2016/06/01/inequality-part-1/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">write about the latter</a>, because writing about the former would be too boring.</p>
<h2>Welcome to the Premium Mediocre</h2>
<p>Premium mediocrity is right at the edge of my expertise. I am around it, but not really <em>of</em> it. Before I explain why I&#8217;m not really it, I&#8217;ll let Venkat describe what <em>it</em> is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class=""p1"">Premium mediocre is the finest bottle of wine at Olive Garden. Premium mediocre is cupcakes and froyo. Premium mediocre is “truffle” oil on anything (no actual truffles are harmed in the making of “truffle” oil), and extra-leg-room seats in Economy. Premium mediocre is cruise ships, artisan pizza, <i>Game of Thrones</i>, and The Bellagio.</p>
<p>Premium mediocre is food that Instagrams better than it tastes. [&#8230;]</p>
<p>The best banana, any piece of dragon fruit, fancy lettuce, <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/11/opinion/how-we-are-ruining-america.html?mcubz=3&amp;_r=0"">David Brooks’ idea of a gourmet sandwich</a>. [&#8230;]</p>
<p>The entire <em>idea </em>of the country that is France is kinda premium mediocre (K-Pop is a big hit there, not coincidentally). The fact that Americans equate “French” with “classy” is proof of its premium mediocrity (Switzerland is the actually elite European country). [&#8230;]</p>
<p>Premium mediocrity is the story of Maya Millennial, <a href=""http://womenlaughingalonewithsalad.tumblr.com/"">laughing alone with her salad</a>. She’s just not a millionaire…yet. She just doesn’t have a mansion…yet. She just doesn’t drive a Tesla…yet.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The essence of premium mediocrity is being optimistically <em>prepared</em> for success by at least being in the right place at the right time, at least for a little while, even if you have no idea how to make anything happen during your window of opportunity. Even if you know nothing else, you know to move to San Francisco or New York and hoping something good happens there, rather than sitting around in some dying small town where you <em>know </em>nothing will ever happen and being curious about anything beyond the town is a cultural transgression. This is a strategy open to all.</p>
<p class=""p1"">As a result, as another buddy Rob Salkowitz put it in our Facebook discussion, premium mediocrity is creating an aura of exclusivity without <em>actually</em> excluding anyone. [&#8230;]</p>
<p class=""p1"">Premium mediocrity is <i>not </i>clueless, tasteless consumption of mediocrity under the mistaken impression that it is actual luxury consumption. Maya Millennial is aware that what she is consuming is mediocre at its core, and only “premium” in some peripheral (and importantly, cheap, such as French-for-no-reason branding) ways. But she consumes it anyway. She is aware that her consumption is tasteless, yet she pretends it is tasteful anyway.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The distinguishing feature is that premium mediocrity only signals an <i>appearance </i>of striving upwards. Everybody in the premium mediocre world recognizes that it is not a reliable indicator of actual upward striving, such as number of code commits on github, or non-bot retweets achieved by on a tweet.</p>
<p class=""p1"">In other words, premium mediocrity is dressing for the lifestyle you’re <em>supposed</em> to want, in order to hold on to the lifestyle you can actually afford — for now — while trying to engineer a stroke of luck.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m a millennial living in New York City, in a premium mediocre neighborhood that&#8217;s second only to Williamsburg in its premium mediocrity. I like froyo, <em>Game of Thrones</em>, artisan pizza, and France. However, I don&#8217;t need to pretend that any of those things are markers of great taste. I actually get sincere, intrinsic pleasure from consuming them.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re not sure what the difference is, ask yourself: <em>would I consume this thing if no one ever knew about it?</em> I&#8217;m a season and a half behind on <em>GoT</em> because I just watch the show, I don&#8217;t need to talk to anyone about it. I&#8217;ll watch the entire thing eventually, by myself.</p>
<p>Enjoying things sincerely is <a href=""http://putanumonit.com/2016/05/11/shopping-for-happiness/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">actually a lot cheaper</a> than consuming the premium mediocre. My favorite wine is <a href=""http://www.totalwine.com/wine/red-wine/red-blend/apothic-red/p/108830750"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Apothic Red</a>, a semi-sweet blend of unidentified and undated California grapes. It sounds like a sommelier&#8217;s nightmare. It&#8217;s not authentic, not cool, and certainly not premium. It&#8217;s also just $9 a bottle and utterly delicious.</p>
<p>My premium mediocre friends drink <a href=""http://www.totalwine.com/wine/red-wine/bordeaux-blend/chateau-de-ferrand-st-emilion-grand-cru/p/27210375?s=303&amp;igrules=true"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Chateau de Ferrand St-Emilion Grand Cru</a>. It&#8217;s French, it&#8217;s really fun to pronounce, it&#8217;s from 2010 (and says so on the bottle). It costs $25. It&#8217;s a lot more tasteful than Apothic, but I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s as tasty.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s behind this difference? <em>Premium Mediocre</em> is a fake-it-till-you-make-it class, and as such there are two things at the heart of it: <strong>signaling </strong>and <strong>uncertainty</strong>. Signaling, because you have to fake it to have a shot at making it. Uncertainty, because you&#8217;re not sure if you will.</p>
<h2>Signaling</h2>
<p>Venkat talks about signaling, but I think he misses the point. To be fair, he actually makes the point, in the part that I bolded below, but then he still misses it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class=""p1"">Viewed as a voluntarily chosen consumption aesthetic, premium mediocrity does not make sense. Why would anyone <em>knowingly </em>pay too much for obviously inferior products and experiences? Why would anyone pay a premium merely to present a facade of upward striving? Why would anyone participate in maintaining a false consciousness <em>knowing </em>it is false? Why would anyone choose the Blue Pill if it didn’t come with a comforting amnesia?</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Why would you give up consumption value for signaling value if none of your in-group peers, among whom you are striving for status, is actually fooled by the signaling?</strong></p>
<p>Who is the illusion <em>for?</em></p>
<p>Part of the answer, in one word, is <em>parents</em>.</p>
<p>Premium mediocrity is in part a theater put on by Maya Millennial in part to spare the feelings of parents. Inter-generational love, not inter-generational war.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The premium mediocre harbor few illusions about their economic condition. The false consciousness at the heart of it is manufactured for the benefit of a parental generation that is convinced it has set the kids up for success.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What premium mediocrity signals to your in-group peers isn&#8217;t that you&#8217;re <em>better or higher status </em>than they are, it&#8217;s that <em>you&#8217;re just like them</em>. You do it so they would hang with you, and so they would pass on your resume if they land a decent job somewhere first. Most importantly, and Venkat probably missed this because he&#8217;s Gen-X and married,<strong> </strong><strong>you signal your premium mediocrity so that premium mediocre people will date you</strong>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve heard that Bumble is the new premium mediocre dating app, but I&#8217;ll get some screenshots of premium mediocrity from <a href=""http://putanumonit.com/2016/02/03/015-dating_1/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">my old favorite</a>, OkCupid. I searched for women aged 22-35 in Manhattan and Brooklyn. All the screenshots below are from the first 10 profiles that came up, not filtered or selected in any other way:</p>

<p>Eel sushi, <em>Breaking Bad</em>, Greek yogurt, <em>Black Mirror, </em>Argentine tango, &#8220;epicurean hedonist sloth&#8221;. I don&#8217;t know if these ladies talk to their parents about any of the above exquisitely premium mediocre items, but it&#8217;s front and center on their dating profiles. You gotta be PM to date PM.</p>
<p>I enjoyed a lot of premium mediocre dates with premium mediocre Maya Millenials, but ultimately they didn&#8217;t make <a href=""http://putanumonit.com/2017/03/12/goddess-spreadsheet/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">the top of the spreadsheet</a>. To understand why I ended up with someone just outside the PM, we need to meet two more characters:</p>
<blockquote><p>You have to situate premium mediocrity, which is a mainstream ethos, relative to its two marginal subcultural neighbors within the same economic stratum: the hipster class to the left, and the lifestyle-designing Tim Ferriss class to the right.</p>
<p>Unlike Maya Millennial, your friendly neighborhood artisan barista Molly Millennial actually cares enough about taste to log serious hours cultivating it<em>. </em>Molly Millennial’s condition is sincerely aestheticized precarity. To forget, if only for a moment, the unsustainability of one’s economic condition by making obsessively high-quality latte art, is to access a temporary retreat from awareness of your false consciousness.</p>
<p>And at the other end of the spectrum you have the hustler, Max Millennial, arbitraging living costs and, with a bit of geo-financial judo, attempting a Boydian flanking maneuver around the collapsing middle-class script.</p>
<p>Four-hour workweek my ass. The Bali-based lifestyle designer people are the second hardest working people I know. Second only to hipsters avariciously collecting and hoarding TasteCoins.</p>
<p>Though polar opposites in many ways — Max is mercenary and instrumental-minded, Molly is missionary and appreciation-minded — they are ultimately two sides of the same coin. Both are likely to be young, white (the premium mediocre class is relatively more diverse), and blessed with Boomer parents given to snide remarks about participation trophies and entitlement. Both are throwbacks to an earlier <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Catcher_in_the_Rye"">Catcher-in-the-Rye anti-phoniness ethos.</a> Both are likely acutely aware of their privileges even as they navigate their difficulties.</p></blockquote>
<p>When my fiancée and I read this part, we had the exact same thought: <em>Max should date Molly!</em> Molly can help Max with the cultural capital he&#8217;s missing out on, introduce him to good coffee and cool friends. Max can help Molly make rent and fly out to Bali. By the way, this option is severely underutilized by hipster guys. <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/wall-street-bank-diversity-2015-8"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">37% of Goldman Sachs</a> employees are women, and they all really like good coffee.</p>
<p>My fiancée isn&#8217;t a hipster about coffee, she&#8217;s a hipster about potassium ion channels in touch receptor neurons. It&#8217;s <a href=""http://putanumonit.com/2017/05/27/strong-men-are-socialist-reports-a-study-that-previously-reported-the-opposite/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">obvious</a> <a href=""http://putanumonit.com/2017/06/20/the-battle-for-psychology/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">from</a> <a href=""http://putanumonit.com/2016/03/01/019-lukewarm-hand/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">my</a> <a href=""http://putanumonit.com/2015/11/10/003-soccer1/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">writing</a> that I&#8217;m a wannabe scientist. My fiancée introduces me to her scientist friends and lets me play at science by doing statistical analysis on the data from her lab. Science is an enjoyable component of our relationship, and it&#8217;s also too transparent a field for serious signaling. By bonding over things like science and rationality, we don&#8217;t have to signal our premium mediocrity to each other.</p>
<h2>Uncertainty</h2>
<p>The markers of the premium mediocre class <em>persist</em> because of intra-class signaling, but the class originally acquired those markers because of the economic uncertainty its members share. I avoided the ambiguous economic situation that leads to premium mediocrity by pure luck of circumstance.</p>
<p>In 2010, I was making minimum wage working a non-premium job in a non-premium city in the Israeli periphery. Instead of premium mediocre things like cocktail bars, climbing gyms and HBO, my friends and I drank <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldstar_(beer)"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Goldstar</a> at home, played soccer and pirated video games.</p>
<p>In 2011, I enrolled in a business school that <a href=""http://www.kenan-flagler.unc.edu/programs/mba/career/employment-statistics"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">places 95% of its students</a> in jobs with a median wage of $110,000. I went from being a galaxy away from the American middle class to an almost guaranteed ticket to the American middle class, without stopping in premium-mediocre-land on the way.</p>
<p>The real middle class life is about security, steady growth, and minimizing tail risk. Premium mediocre is about gambling. The smartest thing for a premium mediocre millennial to gamble on is their skills and personality. The stupidest thing to gamble on is cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>I got genuinely worried about Venkat while reading the following bit, but in retrospect, it&#8217;s so batshit that it must be a joke:</p>
<blockquote><p>About the only path to wealth-building available to the average premium mediocre young person in the developed world today, absent any special technical skills or entrepreneurial bent, is cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>The traditional wealth-building strategy in the US, home ownership, has turned into a mix of a mug’s game and unassailable NIMBY rentierism.</p>
<p>The public markets are no longer reliable wealth builders, while the private markets exclude almost everybody who isn’t already wealthy.</p>
<p>And the tech-startup options lottery and media-celebrity games are not open to those who can’t program at world-eating levels or shitpost at election-winning levels.</p>
<p>That leaves the cryptocurrency lottery as the only documented way up open to all, regardless of skills. Like many other denizens of the premium mediocre class, I too am aspiring cryptobourgeoisie, awaiting The <a href=""https://www.flippening.watch/"">Flippening</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t doubt that cryptocurrencies have and will make many people rich. I just think that none of those people are premium mediocre.</p>
<p>There are tech savvy folks who bought 10 Bitcoins at $300 two years ago and sold them at $2,000 because they understand the blockchain. There are rich people who bought 100 Bitcoins at $600 one year ago after hearing from their tech savvy friends, and they still hold those Bitcoins at $5,000 because they could take that money or leave it. They invested in Bitcoin for the diversification and for the conversation, but it&#8217;s not their lottery ticket.</p>

<p>If you ever worked professionally as a trader or a gambler, you know that the premium mediocre people who bought one Bitcoin at $1,000 sold it at $1,200 instead of buying 10 more. They&#8217;ll do the same with the next 5 cryptocoins to come along, and then the sixth one will go from $1,000 straight to $0 and the premium mediocre crypto-adventure will come to an end with market with a final profit of $0 before fees.</p>
<p>Premium mediocre (aka naive) human psychology is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristics_in_judgment_and_decision-making"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">remarkably ill-suited</a> for casual trading and thinking in probabilistic terms. To make money gambling you need an edge or a big bankroll, usually both. The premium mediocre class, by definition, has neither.</p>
<p>The way to be rich is <a href=""http://putanumonit.com/2017/02/10/get-rich-slowly/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><em>slowly</em></a>: hard work, index funds, increasing your consumption by a small amount each year to avoid the hedonic ratchet. Most people who try to get rich quickly have one thing in common: they&#8217;re not rich.</p>
<h2>FOMO</h2>
<p>The best aspects of the premium mediocre stem from their hope of having it all. The worst aspects stem from the fear of ending up with nothing. Venkat thinks it&#8217;s worth it:</p>
<blockquote><p>Neither Molly, nor Max, has accepted the bargain at the heart of premium mediocrity that Maya Millennial has, which is to refuse to deny <em>either </em>the need for meaning <em>or </em>the need for financial sustainability. Which is why — and this is definitely my attempt at supplying a redemptive account of Maya Millennial’s choices as being fundamentally the correct ones — she chooses to fake both for a while in the hope of acquiring both for good later.</p>
<p>Because Maya Millennial, you see, is the basic bitch. A risk-taker who wants it all. Meaning <em>and </em>money.</p>
<p>Molly thinks Maya has a taste problem; that she is a beyond-the-pale philistine. But Maya knows she actually has a long-term financial sustainability problem and refuses to be in denial about it.</p>
<p>Max thinks Maya has a skills problem; that she’s a bullshit artist who cannot deliver the twitter trends she pretends to understand. But Maya knows she actually has a long-term meaning problem and refuses to be in denial about it.</p>
<p>Max and Molly can no more escape awareness of the false consciousness at the heart of Premium Mediocrity than Maya, but they have crafted temporary refuges that make it easier to temporarily escape from whichever flavor of existential dread — lack of meaning and lack of financial sustainability — bothers them more.</p></blockquote>
<p>I think it&#8217;s bullshit. Molly can dedicate her life to a craft she&#8217;s passionate about and still, by virtue of being an educated urban American, live better than 90% of the planet, just without the sushi and trips to France of the top 10%. Max can make money and find meaning in relationships, or in travel, or in writing a blog.</p>
<p>And what&#8217;s so fucking meaningful about delivering Twitter trends anyway?</p>
<p>Trying to get both money and meaning from the same place is an unnecessary constraint on life. The only reason people think that this constraint is essential is that 99% of memoirs are written by the 1% of people who got rich and famous by #FollowingTheirPassion.</p>
<p>Venkat argues that at the heart of premium mediocrity is a deep and essential kindness. I agree more with <a href=""https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2017/08/17/the-premium-mediocre-life-of-maya-millennial/#comment-270277"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">the commenter</a> who argued that what really drives it is a &#8220;deep and essential FOMO&#8221;. Fear of missing out on success, fame, meaning, sushi, and all the premiums without which you may end up (gasp!) <em>just mediocre</em>.</p>
<p>Places like New York and San Francisco run on FOMO, and that&#8217;s why I love them. It makes them exciting, energizing, full of opportunity. I want to spend time around people who chase the premium rather than settling into the mediocre.</p>
<p>But the FOMO life has serious downsides. The FOMO life is hot takes instead of nuance, because being late is worse than being wrong. The FOMO life is paying 27% APR on your &#8220;premium&#8221; credit card. The FOMO life is 25-minute pomodoros but no 5-year plan. The FOMO life is why <a href=""https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/09/why-generation-y-yuppies-are-unhappy.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">our generation is so unhappy</a>, and why we keep adding to each other&#8217;s misery by crafting premium mediocre images on Facebook to taunt our friends.</p>
<p>I think we would all do better to accept being a little more mediocre, and letting the premiums find us when they may.</p>

The reason to Play in Hard Mode is because it is the only known way to <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/h8/tsuyoku_naritai_i_want_to_become_stronger/"">become stronger</a>, and to defend against Goodhart’s Law.</p><p>Strategies that work in Easy Mode won’t work in Hard Mode.</p><p>The key idea of Hard Mode is to keep your eyes on the prize. You know exactly what you want. You can’t munchkin your way to getting it. Once you start aiming to make a number go up, or get a check in the right box, you have lost sight of the thing you actually want. Proxy measures lead to failure; your <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/y3/value_is_fragile/"">value is fragile</a>. That number correlates to what you want, but only insofar as you’re aiming for the goal and not the number. If you break the spirit of the exercise, all is lost. Your values have been hijacked. If you fail to develop skills along the way, you have missed the point, because the game has no end.</p><p><strong>I</strong></p><p>Consider playing guitar in Rock Band. You must choose whether to play in Hard Mode. If you do, you will fail a lot. You will play the same songs over and over again. Tricks that rely on there only being so many notes, or going at a relaxed pace, collapse. Eventually, you learn new techniques. You get better. You play on expert, your fingers get sore and you smile as you sing along.</p><p><strong>II</strong></p><p>You have a test in a week. You ignore it. You’ve asked questions based on your curiosity, to resolve your confusion. You study what is interesting to you, and what you feel would help you in the future.You focus on learning key principles, knowing you can derive what details you need later on. When the test comes, you work to figure out the answers. When you get the test back, you know how much you have learned. A year later, you remember everything, and build upon it.</p><p><strong>III</strong></p><p>You prepare for a tournament. You seek out the toughest opponents to help you prepare. You stop to criticize each other’s technique and point out every little mistake, no matter how irrelevant to the ultimate outcome of the practice match. You ask why and how you made that mistake. You do the same when you learn something new in a surprising way. You focus on the fundamentals, and don’t worry too much about exactly who you are up against this week. During the matches, you remember every tough decision and every mistake, so you can train again next week.</p><p><strong>IV</strong></p><p>You start a website writing articles devoted to the things you care about. To monetize it, you sell advertising through Google. It does not pay much at first. You keep at it, attracting a small but devoted readership. Some were already your friends, others soon join them. You look at what resonates so you can get feedback, but are careful not to take actions designed to maximize page views. Over time your writing improves and you learn much together. A community of sorts arises. You don’t quit your day job, but you teach others what you have learned.</p><p><strong>V</strong></p><p>(Spoilers for the excellent <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107048/"">Groundhog Day</a>)</p><p>You are stuck in a small snowed-in town, caught in a time loop of unknown origin. At first you have fun doing absurd things, but then you buckle down. With unlimited time, you decide to develop the skills and knowledge to give everyone a perfect day. You learn to play the piano, you read great literature. You listen to and remember the stories of everyone in town, and grow fond of them, learning what your opportunities are to engage in small acts of kindness. At the end of the day, after sufficient iterations*, you know you will be proud of your accomplishments, because you’ve made yourself and the world better, and you just might impress the hell out of your crush. If the loop continues*, you can do it again.</p><p>* – Results not guaranteed. You are unlikely to be in a movie. Local maxima may or may not be sufficient.</p><p>Interlude!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>VI</strong></p><p>Your help your friends move. With time and practice, your group of friends gets quite good and reliable. Any time, day or night, if someone needs to relocate, you’ll all be there, no questions asked. You call yourself the Midnight Movers. Most of your stuff arrives safely at its destination with a minimum of fuss, and you order everyone pizza. Your group draws closer together, and eventually tries going into business together on an unrelated matter.</p><p><strong>VII</strong></p><p>(Medium spoilers for <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4955642/"">The Good Place</a>, highly recommended, skip this if you haven’t seen it yet)</p><p>You have an idea for a television show about a group of strangers who arrive in a mysterious place that plays by very different rules than our reality. You figure out exactly how this place works, plot everything meticulously, and lay out mysteries for the characters and viewers to uncover slowly over time. You use flashbacks that parallel events to examine and deepen the characters. Your production values are top notch and you produce great television. Your show is not a smash hit, and you know exactly where you are going with all this, so you don’t waste a minute, keeping your seasons short. In the end it all fits together, and the journey was still pretty great on second viewing.</p><p><strong>VIII</strong></p><p>Despite the terrible odds against you, you decide to strike out and open a fine Italian restaurant. Your dishes are sublime, but you soon learn that is but a small part of a successful enterprise. You must hire quality staff, arrange logistics across many suppliers, draw in customers and much more. Each step of the way, while ruthlessly keeping costs in check, you answer the question of what you would want your place to be like, and evolve your menu to offer a small selection of the best things you can affordably make. You get to know your customers by name. A casual observer would think you almost dislike money, as you can barely tell from the outside that there is a dining establishment there at all. Slowly word spreads among the cognoscenti, who show up and order the wine. Business is good enough. You get to keep working on perfecting your art.</p><p><strong>IX</strong></p><p>You have something to prove. To yourself.</p><p>Refuse to hire a cleaning service, ever, even though it’s totally worth it.</p><p><a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/jb/applause_lights/"">Minimal applause lights</a>.</p><p>Tell the job interviewer your true strengths and weaknesses. If they don’t hire you, you didn’t want the job. Keep looking.</p><p>Find people to come to your meetup by promising them interesting intellectual discussions and a community devoted to truth.</p><p>Refuse to pirate music, television, movies, software, even when the owners are being kind of a dick and won’t sell it to you.</p><p>When you are in power, respect and minority even when you have the votes, don’t change the rules to pass the laws you want. Strengthen free speech rules and don’t silence those you disagree with, lest they do the same to you.</p><p>Write carefully as you fill out the forms. They might look like bureaucratic nonsense, and no one is likely to ever read them, but you should get this straight and cultivate good habits.</p><p>Learn to speak the language.</p><p>At your meetup, welcome challenges to in-group principles, so your group will be viewed better and feel more welcoming to and attract more members who seek the truth more than they demonstrate membership in the in-group.</p><p>Show other people what to do by example.</p><p>For demo day, you show what your system can do, and hope that you can keep building it. For that you need funding.</p><p><strong>X</strong></p><p>Dismayed by terrible things, you devote your life to the promise of artificial general intelligence. You discover that contrary to your initial beliefs, not only is creating AGI not easy, most versions of it kill everyone and destroy all utility in the universe. Explaining this is super hard. None of your explanations work. No one understands the danger. You set out to teach the world rationality, hoping this will cause them to see the potential dangers, with limited success. You write a book that’s silly but gets you exposure. You keep writing. Machine learning accomplishes more things and starts to get more funding. People start to come around to AI being dangerous, but mostly for the wrong reasons, so you don’t expect anyone to take the right precautions, and fear the world is doomed. You think that when they arrive, it will be far too late to correct for safety problems later.</p><p><strong>XI</strong></p><p>You are at a meeting to arrange educational services for your son. You know that the only thing that matters is what is written on the education plan. Whatever is in that document is what will count. Still, you cannot let the numerous falsehoods and stupid things pass, even though you realize that if you just play nice, they are going to put down on the piece of paper the thing that you want on the piece of paper. If you keep arguing, you risk getting nothing. Luckily, you think better of it in time. You go into <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/08/26/play-in-easy-mode/"">easy mode</a>. They write the words you need on the piece of paper. You sign it.

<p>Easy Mode is easier. The reason to Play in Easy Mode is because it is the best known way to achieve your explicit measurable goal and get to the victory screen.</p>
<p>Strategies that work in Easy Mode won&#8217;t work in Hard Mode.</p>
<p>The key idea of Easy Mode is to keep your eyes on the prize. You know exactly what you want. You will munchkin your way to getting it. As long as you get a high enough number, or a check in the right box, you have what you want. That number isn&#8217;t just a proxy for victory. It <em>is </em>victory. If you break the spirit of the exercise, nothing is lost. Your values are safe. You are not here to develop skills, because the game ends here.</p>
<p><span id=""more-10725""></span></p>
<p>I</p>
<p>Consider playing guitar in Rock Band. You must choose whether to play in Easy Mode. If you do, you won&#8217;t fail. You won&#8217;t need to play the same songs over and over again. You can use tricks that rely on there only being so many notes, or going at a relaxed pace. You get to enjoy playing what you want, enjoying all the modes, advancing your band, right away. You get treated better. You play on medium, your fingers don&#8217;t hurt, and you smile as you sing along.</p>

<p>You have a test in a week. You cram for it. You&#8217;ve asked questions based on your desire to know what will be on the test, to resolve your confusion. You figure out what questions will be asked, what will help you in the exam. You focus on memorizing key facts, phrases and techniques, knowing you can <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/iq/guessing_the_teachers_password/"">guess the teacher&#8217;s password</a>. When the test comes, you give back the answers. When you get the test back, you know you have passed and never have to think about that class again. A year later, you have forgotten everything, but you have a degree to build on.</p>
<p>III</p>
<p>You prepare for a tournament. You seek out representative opponents to help you prepare. You look for mistakes you can exploit, and ask what won or lost you each practice match. You ask how you can turn those events in your favor. You don&#8217;t worry about surprising things unless you expect them to be common. You focus on what wins matches, and don&#8217;t worry too much about little things that are unlikely to make a big enough difference this week. During the matches, you do everything you can to win, then train against next week.</p>
<p>IV</p>
<p>You start a website writing articles devoted to the things you care about. To monetize it, you sell advertising through Google. It does not pay much at first. You keep at it, posting links where you can and tracking what vectors draw in readers. Some are your friends, others seem less special. You look at what gets you clicks and likes, and craft your posts and topics that way, sculpting articles to maximize page views. Over time you learn the tricks of the trade and periodically go viral. A community knows who you are. You quit your day job to run the site full time, and teach others what you have learned.</p>
<p>V</p>
<p>(Spoilers for <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107048/"">some old movie</a>)</p>
<p>You are stuck in a small snowed-in town, caught in a time loop of unknown origin. At first you have fun doing absurd things, but then you buckle down. With unlimited time, you decide to seduce the person you have a crush on. You learn to play them like a piano, to act like a character out of great literature. You listen to, A/B test and remember every reaction, until you learn what will make them fond of you, locating opportunities to get and succeed on a date. At the end of the day, after sufficient iterations*, you know you will be proud of your accomplishments, because you will get to bang the hell out of your crush. If the loop continues*, you can do it again.</p>
<p>* &#8211; Results not guaranteed. You are unlikely to be in a movie. Local maxima may or may not be sufficient.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>VI</p>
<p>You hire a moving company to help you move. With time and practice, this group of employees has gotten good and reliable. Any time, if someone needs to relocate, they&#8217;ll all be there, no questions asked. You call yourself, every so often. All your stuff arrives safely at its destination with a minimum of fuss, and you tip generously. You get some well-needed relaxation and peace of mind.</p>
<p>VII</p>
<p>(Minor spoiler for <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0411008/"">Lost</a>, at least Season 1 recommended)</p>
<p>You have an idea for a television show about a group of strangers who arrive in a mysterious place that plays by very different rules than our reality. You figure out some of the ways this place works, know some of the events that will happen, and lay out mysteries for the characters and viewers to uncover slowly over time. You use flashbacks that parallel events to examine and deepen the characters. Your production values are top notch and you produce great television. Your show is a smash hit, plus you&#8217;re not sure exactly where you are going with all this, so you let things drag a bit, padding with extra episodes. In the end it doesn&#8217;t quite fit together, but the journey was still pretty great.</p>
<p>VIII</p>
<p>To fulfill the terms of your late uncle&#8217;s last will and testament, you are forced to pursue what he knew to be your passion, and to strike out and open a fine Italian restaurant. Your dishes are sublime, but you soon learn that is but a small part of a successful enterprise. You must hire quality staff, arrange logistics across many suppliers, draw in customers and much more. Each step of the way, while ruthlessly keeping costs in check, you answer the question of what customers would need to see in your place to come in, and expand your menu to offer all the things a diverse group might want. You get to know your customers by type. A casual observer wouldn&#8217;t notice how your choices of seating and lighting make you more money, or the new cheaper sources for your ingredients; all they know is that the signs tell them the establishment here will let them have a nice evening. Steadily you iterate and attract more people, and get more of them to order the wine. Business is good. You hope you made your uncle proud and talk to an agent about franchising.</p>
<p>IX</p>
<p>You have something to prove.</p>
<p>Hire a cleaning service every so often. It&#8217;s totally worth it.</p>
<p>Lots of <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/jb/applause_lights/"">applause lights</a>.</p>
<p>Tell the job interviewer the strengths and weaknesses they want to hear. If they don&#8217;t hire you, learn and improve your game, and keep looking.</p>
<p>Find people to come to your meetup by offering them a free hat. Or at least, free pizza.</p>
<p>Pirate music, television, movies, software, even when the owners aren&#8217;t being kind of a dick and would sell it to you.</p>
<p>When you are in power, respect the minority only when you don&#8217;t have the votes, change the rules to pass the laws you want. Weaken free speech rules and silence those you disagree with, lest they win and do the same to you.</p>
<p>Write whatever you want on the forms. They are useless bureaucratic nonsense. No one is ever going to read them. Now you can forget this and move on to more important things.</p>
<p>Learn your whole speech phonetically.</p>
<p>At your meetup, do not allow challenges to in-group principles, so your group will be viewed better and feel more welcoming to and attract more members of the in-group, by demonstrating loyal membership in the in-group.</p>
<p>Tell other people what to do.</p>
<p>For demo day, you show something cool your system might someday do, when you get around to building one. For that you need funding.</p>
<p>X</p>
<p>Dismayed by terrible things, you devote your life to the promise of artificial intelligence. You discover that contrary to your initial beliefs, not only is creating AI not easy, the problem is super hard! None of your programs work! No one understands the potential. You set out to teach the AI to play games and optimize recommendations, hoping this will let them see the potential benefits, with limited  success. You schedule exhibition matches that are silly, but get you exposure. You keep coding. Machine learning accomplishes more things and starts to get more funding. People start to come around to AI being dangerous, but mostly for the wrong reasons, so you know their arguments are bad. You take some precautions, but you don&#8217;t worry about the world being doomed. You are confident that if they arrive, we can correct for any safety problems later.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>XI</p>
<p>You are at a meeting to arrange educational services for your son. You know that the only thing that matters is what is written on the education plan. Whatever is in that document is what will count. You let numerous falsehoods and stupid things pass, because you realize that if you just play nice, they are going to put down on the piece of paper the thing that you want on the piece of paper. They write the words you need on the piece of paper. You sign it. You walk away happy.</p>
<p>In conclusion:</p>

However, unless this is someone you are particularly close to, you may not know how. So if you tell them that you want to support them, then they'll just reach out whenever they need support, right?<br /><br />Well, not exactly. A person who is struggling isn't necessarily going to reach out, and those who do are more likely to reach out to those closest to them -- a partner or best friend. A generic offer of help doesn't often do much because it doesn't let the person know <i>how </i>you want to help. You could be imagining yourself as a shoulder to cry on for a recent divorcee, while what they may really need is a place to stay or help moving. They may choose to not ask for help if they fear rejection, or may ask you to help with one of those things, only to result in an awkward conversation due to differences in expectation. So how do you ensure you <i>actually</i>&nbsp;get to help your friend?<br /><br />One way of doing this is by saying specifically how you're willing to help. The more specific, the better! Even ""I'm here if you need to talk"" could result in misunderstanding if they want to vent and you think they want to problem solve. If you know more about your friend and their failure modes, you can find ways to help that are specific to them. For example, offering to spend time supporting them as they answer old emails, or message them with encouraging thoughts when they're about to step into a date or job interview. A particularly social friend may see something as simple as planning to spend time together as a way of showing you care, while some may think the same of starting a text or online conversation. If you can't think of specific ways to help someone, initiating contact may be a good place to start.<br /><br />Some people are liable to forget what thing you offered to do, especially if their life tends towards the more stressful. Asking someone how they're doing can be a good move here, particularly for friends with more stressful lives. This can be an easy way to transition into a venting or problem solving conversation if that is your preferred way of helping, or you can discuss other ways they could use your help. Even if your friend doesn't need help in that moment, they will feel good about the fact that you reached out.<br /><br />Caring for someone doesn't just have to be for times of stress. If the only time someone gets care is when they're struggling, it can create perverse incentives for them to continue to not be okay. In a sense, then, continuing to show care for someone when they're doing well helps too. It can top off their emotional reserves so that they are less likely to be depleted. Spending low key one-on-one time with someone can do a lot to help with this (especially for the more introverted among us), as does having ongoing conversations with them over email or messenger, or creating affordances for lowered emotional barriers.<br /><br />When you want to offer support, it's also good to keep track of what kinds of support you are good at giving and what kinds of support you enjoy giving. Often, people have stable preferences for the kind of support they need, so although it's always best to ask first, it may feel nice for a depressed friend if someone checked in to see if they are hungry, and then prepared food for them. This is especially the case if the depressed person often struggles to prepare or order food, and the helper enjoys cooking. Essentially, a person's love language (service, words, etc) may determine the best way to help them, just as your preferred love language giving-wise may be your preferred way to help others in need.<br /><br />It is easy to fail to be helpful, despite good intentions. Results can range from awkward to hurtful, and it's often hard to disentangle how things could have gone better. We can play by the golden rule here, but let's take it a step further and help people as they would like to be helped. It can create more work upfront, but in the end you are not only helping the person, but also meta-helping by doing so in a more helpful way.</div>",squidious,squidious,squidious,

<hr />
<p>Because I live on the internet I sometimes meet some interesting characters. &nbsp;On this particular occasion I found myself in a conversation with someone who suggested, &ldquo;I don't know if I'm paranoid or not&rdquo;. &nbsp;The full story had some drug use and what I can only describe as peculiar circumstances (if they were in fact being accurately reported, but I have no reason not to believe the reports).</p>
<p>Intrigued by this puzzle and I was not entirely sure what the best course of action to do with a potential mentally unwell person - Should I discourage the stories, should I indulge the stories? &nbsp;If I say something that causes my friend to drop into a state of greater paranoia I would be liable to try to help them out again. &nbsp;After a short while of talking I figured that I would just try and get the person to think and feel about the ""edges"" of what it means to have paranoia.</p>
<p>Which is how I came up with the idea to run some simple thought experiment tests that might give you a hint as to whether you have paranoia or not. &nbsp;I didn't know if I could be trusted by this person so I was always very careful to suggest ideas and not insist on any ideas. &nbsp;It's not necessary for me to insist someone seek treatment.</p>
<p>As a brain living inside the conditions like paranoia it's difficult to have an objective test because any scientific test that can be done on faulty equipment is going to come up with faulty results the equivalent to the fault. &nbsp;A camera with a dust speck on it's lens will always take a photo of the dust spec. Unfortunately paranoia is a more complicated fault to test. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Any experiment that you might try, could run into multiple errors at the same time or multiple errors in the one experiment. &nbsp;Could paranoia machinery change at different times of day? &nbsp;Different amounts of stress? &nbsp;If you were to try and design a normal experiment knowing that your equipment was faulty you'll be trying to aim for reliability, validity and accuracy.</p>
<p>Repeating the experiment for reliability - which is to say that if you were shooting an arrow and you always land in the direction of the target you know you have at least the reliability to shoot an arrow. &nbsp;If you regularly hit one foot to the left of the bullseye you have the accuracy to get close to the target, you just need to move the target or improve your aim so that you actually hit it.</p>
<p>The other problem that you might have is validity. Which is if you try to weigh a feather to work out how much an average feather weighs but you only happen to have peacock feathers you might end up with a different answer than if you measured a pigeon's feathers. &nbsp;Depending on what you want to know - your experiment needs to validly come to a result. a result that doesn't represent the information you are trying to measure is going to be useless.</p>
<p><strong>Tests</strong></p>
<p>In thinking about paranoia how can you test whether you are paranoid or not using your faulty equipment that may or may not be faulty (paranoid) &nbsp;First I started trying to think of something that is a little bit random but has a known randomness to it. For example a coin flip. You know that it will probably land either heads or tails but it might be a test that you have to run a couple of times before you conclude that it is it a biased or before you conclude that the coin is actually random.</p>
<p>The next strategy I considered was the random person strategy. For example a stranger on a bus or a server at the supermarket. &nbsp;In law there is a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_man_on_the_Clapham_omnibus"">reasonable person</a> test that can be applied, something like, ""what would a reasonable person have done in the situation given the details and facts of the experience that the defendant was going through"". &nbsp;Curiously the reasonable hypothetical person was once described as, <em>""The man on the Clapham omnibus is a reasonably educated, intelligent but nondescript person, against whom the defendant's conduct can be</em> measured."", or, ""<em>The bald-headed man at the back of the omnibus."". &nbsp;</em>As a map-making strategy, I find it kind of neat that they describe a<em> ""reasonable person"" </em>as a<em> ""man on the bus"".</em> &nbsp;So when running your experiment or thought experiment - do you think you could ask a stranger on a bus the result of a coin flip and have them tell you the true answer?</p>
<p>For a non paranoid person - the server at the supermarket, or a person on the bus has no incentive to lie to you about anything you might ask them. &nbsp;If you are specifically unsure if the other humans are all in cahoots with each other scheming against you, at some point it gets damn expensive to pull off a ruse like ""all of the people on every bus you ever catch are paid to stand around and answer your questions incorrectly"". For example if you ask the stranger on a bus,&nbsp;what day of the week it was - do you think you could trust their answer?</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Costs</strong></p>
<p>If all the humans in your life, or many of the humans in your life were part of a grand scheme, very quickly the cost of maintaining a grand scheme starts to grow. Where maybe a room full of people could pull a practical joke on someone for about an hour or two - ""just for fun""... &nbsp;By the time the ruse's&nbsp;time scale stretches out to a day or perhaps several days there needs to be some sort of value being generated, for simplicity - in terms of ""dollars"" to incentivise people to &ldquo;keep playing along&rdquo;. By the time you want your brain to believe that - 5 people you have never met - scheming or pulling a practical joke on you. If those 5 people spend more than a day on that practical joke the cost of keeping them pulling that joke starts to escalate where a full day might be 12 hours x 5 people x your country's minimum wage (I will use $10 for simplicity) = $600 for a day's practical joke. &nbsp;It's not cheap. &nbsp;I would say bordering on irrational to burn that sort of cost on a practical joke.</p>
<p>I really want to believe that I am important enough to scheme about but I know the incentives here. If you can't afford to pay those 5 confederates to participate in your practical joke then after about a day they're going to go home and get on with their lives. &nbsp;I do consider myself ""valuable"" but I don't know that I consider myself valuable enough for a 10 person scheme for 3 days even (10*12*3*10=$3600). &nbsp;I mean, depending on what it's worth to pull a thinly veiled paranoia plot, epic scheme or hilarious practical joke - there has to be a monetary cost to the scheme. &nbsp;By the time you start to include public places - clearing up any chance of the ""scheme"" failing, starts to get quite expensive.</p>
<p>Maybe your number is higher than mine - maybe you think someone has $10,000 to spend on fooling you for a few days. But there still should be a limit to how complicated a scheme must be before it is unreasonably complicated and unlikely to be possible or valid because it just cost too damn much to pull off.</p>

<p><strong>A note</strong></p>
<p>What if you wrote yourself a note and hid it in a drawer? &nbsp;Do you think that you could come back the following morning and expect that no one had tampered with it?</p>
<p>What if you wrote the note in code? &nbsp;A simple <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_cipher"">substitution cipher</a>&nbsp;is all it takes to make a slightly higher barrier to tampering. &nbsp;Do you think you could trust the note to not be tampered with now?</p>
<hr />
<p>From <a href=""http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0147905"">existing research</a>&nbsp;we know that there is a limited number of people who can be involved in a conspiracy before it becomes unwieldy to keep a secret.<br /><img src=""http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/figure/image?size=medium&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0147905.g001"" alt="""" /><br />Simply put if you have too many people involved in the conspiracy it becomes impossible to keep a secret as time goes on.<br /><img src=""http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/figure/image?size=medium&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0147905.t004"" alt="""" /></p>
<p>The research (if you agree with their models and I am not so sure that I do) seems to suggest a much higher number of participants than I would have guessed, still. &nbsp;Interesting to know.</p>
<hr />
<p>Mostly I am curious of what test you might use or generate to evaluate if you are paranoid. &nbsp;Knowing of course that no test is perfect and your faulty hardware could be getting in the way of you actually noticing a scheme afoot, or being able to tell if you are paranoid.</p>",Elo,elo,Elo,
Y6yJ9ye42zytk6ABw,"Social Insight: Status Exchange: When an Insult Is a Compliment, When a Compliment Is an Insult",social-insight-status-exchange-when-an-insult-is-a,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Y6yJ9ye42zytk6ABw/social-insight-status-exchange-when-an-insult-is-a,2017-08-25T03:57:03.908Z,9,6,11,False,False,,"<p>Some rough synonyms for status include respect, prestige, and ""coolness.""</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conceptually, the idea I sometimes think of when I try to describe ""status"" in its constituent parts is that to have status is to have people feel that they owe you something, to feel like they would if you had just given them a gift. The balance of give-and-take in the encounter is tilted in your favor. Picture a king among subjects, being given gifts and praises. Every brush of his hand is itself a gift, every glance of his eyes a praise to the recipient. The give-and-take in a relationship is never <em>exactly </em>equal, and high status people have it tilted strongly in their favor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the people you know, you'll have implicitly established an individual give-and-take relationship with each of them, and if one of you fails to give as much as that balance (or imbalance) requires, you'll be asked to apologize. So, if you have a 60-40 relationship (your way) with someone, and they only give you 50, you'll feel offended and ask for the apology. An apology is essentially a recognition of failure to give somebody as much as is expected, and a promise to give them more from now on/take less from now on. In other words, to shift the actual give-and-take favorably in their direction. This is why asking for an apology is essentially a re-negotiation of power/a request for submission.</p>
<p>(You'll note that you can feel offended for being treated <em>fairly </em>if that's not what your give-and-take has been in the past, just like someone can apologize for acting fairly if more than that is expected of them. This is why apologies can be purposefully sought and extracted with the intention of gaining status/re-negotiating the give-and-take of the relationship. Ammunition will be noted, stored, and prepared in advance and the encounter will be initiated at a strategically opportune time. Ammunition includes anything that can make someone <em>feel </em>sorry, and sometimes you can win without ammunition by continuing to act or feel like you've been wronged even without being able to give a justification for it.)</p>
<p>With people you don't know, general status determines how much they ""owe"" you and you them. If you are high status, people will feel like they owe you even before you've had any give and take. They will treat you much the same way as they would if you had just done them a great favor and they wanted to show you appreciation and thanks. &nbsp;As I said, having high status = people feel the same way they would feel if they owed you something in real life/you were giving them things in real life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A compliment can be seen in two ways: an assessment of a person, or as an attempt to raise their status. If you ever hear a nonsensical compliment, it's probably being used simply to raise the recipient's status, not to use language to describe a quality the person has. The entire message is summed up in this: that words clearly identifiable as definitely-a-compliment are spoken at all, not in what those specific words are.</p>
<p>Over-the-top compliments are one kind of nonsensical compliment, and as said, are (on the surface) attempts to raise someone's status, not comments on their qualities or abilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's blur out the words and look at how giving-a-compliment affects social status.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How good does a compliment make you feel? Scratch that. How good do compliments make <em>most </em>people feel. Personally, I'd feel better about a compliment the more I thought it said something I valued about myself, multiplied by how capable an assessor of that thing I considered the compliment-er. &nbsp;So if you can consistently guess people's IQ or future success, and tell me you think I've got the stuff, that's an amazing compliment, even if you're the whipping boy of the tribe. It is now my impression that most people's appreciation for a compliment is calculated differently.</p>
<p>Take the effusiveness of the compliment and add a bonus for how much <em>more</em>&nbsp;status than the complimented the compliment-er has (or subtract the difference if they have less status). That's how much people appreciate a given compliment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Effusiveness can partially be measured without even understanding the language being spoken. The tone and body language will communicate how much deference is being shown the complimented.</p>
<p>You can also find some of the compliment's effusiveness in the actual words. Mostly just look at adjectives and adverbs, though. Are you <em>extremely </em>something-or-other? Cool, bump up the effusiveness a little. Are you <em>tremendous</em>? Ditto. However, whether you're extremely this versus that, or <em>what </em>you're tremendous about exactly, is mostly irrelevant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for how status affects things, let's say whatever your status is, someone has status a little bit lower, maybe it's -1 relative to you.`So, penalize the power of the compliment accordingly, it'll come out a little bit weaker than the effusiveness alone would suggest. In contrast, if Johnny Depp compliments you, or even nods at you approvingly, this ""compliment"" will get a substantial bonus for coming from a higher status person.</p>
<p>""Oh my god; he looked at me"" comes from this kind of thing. In contrast, ""I don't want your apology/money"" also does, when the other person is lower status (being mad at someone is like temporarily treating them like they have much lower status than usual).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can see how this dynamic will play out if you start with ""compliments from higher people feel better"" and follow its implications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If getting a compliment from a cool person feels better, then acting happy to receive a compliment signals that you consider them to be of higher status. At least, if you act happy <em>enough</em>. Get too excited about a compliment, and that suggests that you consider the other person to be of higher status than you (but you still have to do it when they really <em>are </em>higher status; it's quite awkward not to act pleased about a compliment from a higher-up and you'll lose points if you don't act in the usual manner).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So let's say someone of equal status give you a mild compliment, not particularly effusive. If you act all excited, you've signaled that you are lower status than them. If someone of lower status mildly compliments you and you act impressed <em>at all</em>, you've lowered your status even more (ignoring counter-signaling for the moment).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every compliment is a two-way street. The compliment is a signal of how they perceive your status relative to theirs, and how you <em>receive </em>the compliment signals how you perceive their status relative to yours. Both the compliment-er and the complimented have to choose their move, some choices grabbing for status and others granting it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can see how this plays out with low-status people who are desperate to give you over-the-top compliments. Every compliment is also an attempt to <em>receive </em>something. They want to see your reaction. If you respond at all, that validates them to some degree (and potentially lowers your status as a result). If they don't get the reactions they want, they'll exaggerate your merits, practically begging you to be appreciative in some way. You might also notice how awkward it feels to receive such excessive compliments from someone of lower status. (I might recommend taking them to the side, alone, where that feeling will suddenly disappear (mostly) and giving them some tips about not begging so much).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This feeling is instinctive, I hypothesize. It protects your status, and you can see why if you learn this stuff and think it through. But of course, evolution would like to get you not to respond to low-status people <em>without </em>you having to consciously know all this stuff. So it gives you a feeling. A feeling's a lot easier for evolution to give an organism than complicated abstract knowledge is.</p>
<p>This feeling makes you feel unimpressed by low-status compliments and awkward about the whole thing so as to preserve your status via not acting appreciative, lest you signal your acceptance of the compliment-er as higher status than you (or closer in status to you than they are).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand, a high-status person might find it useful to force you to choose between acting grateful to them and violating social norms. Giving you a compliment can force you into exactly that situation. Maybe you just met and want to impress Party C, so you have to present your nice, civilized face (see ""person masks"" at&nbsp;http://www.meltingasphalt.com/personhood-a-game-for-two-or-more-players/). Under those circumstances, ""violate social norms"" is not available to you, so if you receive a compliment, you kind of have to respond, you know? Inside you might be seething, though, as your hated rival forces you to dance through some hoops by offering you ever more effusive compliments.</p>
<p>A compliment, just like a gift, can be an offensive move. It pushes you into a certain role;&nbsp;If you don't act appreciative enough/reciprocate, you might lose points.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A compliment can be a gift, or an attack, or it can be begging, or it can be a test.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, let's imagine how these principles play out in a variety of situations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. High compliments Low effusively. Low is only mildly appreciative, signaling higher status than they have. High is offended. Low doesn't act embarrassed(have you no shame?!) and loses points in High's eyes.</p>
<p>2. Several Lows effusively compliment a High. Then, one Low says something only mildly complimentary about High. Everyone tenses up a little and looks at Low (to censure him) and High (to see his reaction). Low has signaled possible enmity. The compliment is an insult.</p>
<p>3. A High on the enemy side singles out and insults a Low in your group. The Low is elevated by the attention of the High and is considered ""a real player"" now. The insult is a compliment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've seen this one many a times in politics, where people are proud when they are personally decried by famous enemies. ""Did you hear that Trump said I was dumb? Awesome, am I right?""</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the past, playing by my own rules (compliments are worth most if accurate, informationally-dense, and coming from a competent assessor) led me to, from everyone else's perspective act quite chaotically. To them, it seemed that sometimes I made the appropriate response and maintained status. Occasionally I accidentally executed elaborate plots which ended in my status increasing. But mostly, I consistently broke the rules in a way that lost me status and proved I didn't understand what was really going on. Which I didn't.</p>
<p>Most people seem to play by these rules (and others), so if you want to understand what they're doing, and how your actions look to <em>them</em>, this is one of the building blocks.</p>",Bound_up,bound_up,Bound_up,

Suppose A intends to cross a road, and A checks both sides of the road, ensures it's clear and then attempts to cross. However, a meteorite strikes at that exact moment, and A is killed. A is not irrational for attempting to cross the road, giving that t hey did not know of the meteorite (and thus could not have accounted for it). Suppose B has more knowledge than A, and thus knows that there is substantial delay between meteor strikes in the vicinity, and then crosses after A and safely crosses.

For those who already understand them, this post probably won't contain anything new. As always, I take no personal credit for the ideas, only for the specific mathematical model.</em></p>
<p>People usually think about decision-making in terms of causality, where an agent's action causes an outcome to happen. In this post I will outline a different idea of ""causality"", which can work even if regular causality isn't available. For example, in the world of natural numbers it doesn't make sense to say that the sentence <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""1+1=2""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mn""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">1</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space2""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.298em; padding-bottom: 0.446em;"">+</span></span><span class=""mjx-mn MJXc-space2""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">1</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.077em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">=</span></span><span class=""mjx-mn MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">2</span></span></span></span></span></span> somehow ""causes"" the sentence <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""2+2=4""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mn""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">2</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space2""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.298em; padding-bottom: 0.446em;"">+</span></span><span class=""mjx-mn MJXc-space2""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">2</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.077em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">=</span></span><span class=""mjx-mn MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">4</span></span></span></span></span></span> to be true. Yet we can devise a notion of ""logical causality"" that will work in such worlds, and allow us to make decisions which maximize utility in some sense. The rest of this post is devoted to making these claims precise.</p>

<p>By now an interesting pattern is starting to emerge. Let's say <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""O""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">O</span></span></span></span></span></span> is the formula that results from the variable <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""o""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">o</span></span></span></span></span></span> after applying the fixed point. In all cases except (2) where <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""O""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">O</span></span></span></span></span></span> is false by fiat, we see that <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""A""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">A</span></span></span></span></span></span> tries and succeeds to make <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""O""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">O</span></span></span></span></span></span> true! Metaphorically, here's what <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""A""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">A</span></span></span></span></span></span> is doing: ""If I can prove that my truth implies the truth of <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""O""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">O</span></span></span></span></span></span>, then I choose to be true, otherwise I choose to be false"". That's the basic idea of ""logical causality"", in the simplest possible setting where it works.</p>
<p>Note that all sentences above can be interpreted as sentences about natural numbers within Peano arithmetic, by using <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del_numbering"">Gödel numbering</a> to spell out the provability operator. For example, in point (4) <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""A""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">A</span></span></span></span></span></span> would be a long sentence about the natural numbers, and <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""O""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">O</span></span></span></span></span></span> would be a slightly longer sentence that has <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""A""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">A</span></span></span></span></span></span> embedded inside it. In decision-making terms, <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""A""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">A</span></span></span></span></span></span> is the ""action"" and <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""O""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">O</span></span></span></span></span></span> is the ""outcome"" that logically depends on the action, but <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""O""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">O</span></span></span></span></span></span>'s dependence on <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""A""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">A</span></span></span></span></span></span> is not explicit, because both are closed formulas without free variables. Instead, the dependence is due to <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""A""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">A</span></span></span></span></span></span> knowing the Gödel number of <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""O""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">O</span></span></span></span></span></span>.</p>
<p>To skip ahead a bit, it's easy to go from a formalism about natural numbers to a formalism about computer programs, which know their own source code by <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_(computing)"">quining</a>. The examples above can be directly translated to programs that have access to a provability oracle for Peano arithmetic, or (with some caveats) to programs that successively search for proofs and check them manually. In fact, that was the original motivation for this line of research, because ""programs trying to influence a larger program that they are embedded in"" might be a good description of our own world, at least from the perspective of a program :-)</p>
<p>Going back to the math, perhaps the approach will break down if we have more possible choices than just true or false? Let's assume a more general setting, where we have formulas <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""F_1(a_1,\dotsc,a_m,o_1,\dotsc,o_n),\dotsc,F_m(a_1,\dotsc,a_m,o_1,\dotsc,o_n)""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base"" style=""margin-right: -0.106em;""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em;

<ul>
<li>event: I broke your vase.</li>
<li>event: I bought you a gift but then left it at home</li>
<li>event: I want to go to a (privately valuable event) on our (relationship important day)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Options:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><em>I wanted to save you the effort of thinking about the thing and so I decided not to tell/ask you before it was resolved.</em></li>
<li><em>I wanted to not have to withhold a thing from you so I told you as soon as it was bothering me so that I didn't have to lie/cheat/withhold/deceive you even if I thought it was in your best interest</em></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Discussion:</strong></p>
<p>what is a better plan of action?</p>
<p>1 would be doing emotional labour in the form of:</p>
<blockquote><em>I thought about the event and how you would feel about it and modelled how I thought you would feel and then acted according to what I thought was best for you feeling better.</em></blockquote>
<p>2 would be to put an emotional burden on the other person but carries with it more honesty, more expectation that the other person is autonomous and able to make choices for themselves.</p>
<blockquote><em>I didn't want to withhold anything, but instead burdened you with making the choice about what to do about the matter by telling you about my conundrum.</em></blockquote>
<p>I used to do 1, but now I do 2. The relationship books tend to suggest 2.</p>
<p>All of the things my brain ever conjured up used to tell me 1. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Brain:&nbsp;<em>Make the martyr choice for people. &nbsp;Don't tell them, suffer in secret.</em></p>
<p>I made a lot of relationship mistakes doing 1's in various situations and now I do 2s. &nbsp;I don't know why this works but it lines up with everything I ever read - NVC, Daring greatly, Gottman institute research. I don't have much to add other than - I wonder if you do 1's or 2's. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I would prefer people do 2's not 1's around me. (<a href=""https://erratio.dreamwidth.org/154861.html"">A little more on emotional labour</a>)</p>

Most of these ultimately came from someone else's recommendation, so I thought I'd pay it forward by posting ten of my favorite small improvements.</p>
<p>(I've given credit where I remember who introduced the item into my life. Obviously the biggest part of the credit goes to the creator.)</p>
<h2>Video speed</h2>
<p><a href=""https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/video-speed-controller/nffaoalbilbmmfgbnbgppjihopabppdk?hl=en"">Video Speed Controller</a>&nbsp;lets you speed up HTML 5 video; it gives a nicer interface than the YouTube speed adjustment and works for most videos displayed in a browser (including e.g. netflix/amazon).</p>
<p>(Credit: Stephanie Zolayvar?)</p>
<h2>Spectacle</h2>
<p><a href=""https://www.spectacleapp.com/"">Spectacle</a> on OSX provides keyboard shortcuts to snap windows to any half or third of the screen (or full screen).</p>
<h2>Pinned tabs + tab wrangler</h2>
<p>I use&nbsp;<a href=""https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tab-wrangler/egnjhciaieeiiohknchakcodbpgjnchh?hl=en"">tab wrangler</a>&nbsp;to automatically close tabs (and save a bookmark) after 10m. I keep gmail and vimflowy&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.wikihow.com/Pin-Tabs-in-Google-Chrome"">pinned</a>&nbsp;so that they don't close. For me, closing tabs after 10m is usually the right behavior.</p>
<h2>Aggressive AdBlock</h2>
<p>I use&nbsp;<a href=""https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adblock/gighmmpiobklfepjocnamgkkbiglidom?hl=en-US"">AdBlock</a>&nbsp;for anything that grabs attention even if isn't an ad. I usually block ""related content,"" ""next stories,"" the whole youtube sidebar, everything on Medium other than the article, the gmail sidebar, most comment sections, etc. Similarly, I use&nbsp;<a href=""https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/kill-news-feed/hjobfcedfgohjkaieocljfcppjbkglfd?hl=en"">kill news feed</a>&nbsp;to block my Facebook feed.</p>
<h2>Avoiding email inbox</h2>
<p>I often need to write or look up emails during the day, which would sometimes lead me to read/respond to new emails and switch contexts. I've mostly fixed the problem by leaving gmail open to my list of starred&nbsp;emails rather than my inbox, ad-blocked the ""Inbox (X)"" notification, and pin gmail so that I can't see the ""Inbox (X)"" title.</p>
<h2>Christmas lights</h2>
<p>I prefer the soft light from christmas lights to white overhead lights or even softer lamps. My favorite are multicolored lights, though soft white lights also seem OK.</p>

<h2>Karabiner</h2>
<p><a href=""https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner"">Karabiner</a>&nbsp;remaps keys in a very flexible way. (Unfortunately, it only works on OSX pre-Sierra. Would be very interested if there is any similarly flexible software that )</p>
<p>Some changes have helped me a lot:</p>
<ul>
<li>While holding s: hjkl move the cursor. (Turn on ""Simple Vi Mode v2"") I find this way more convenient than the arrow keys.</li>
<li>While holding d: hjkl move the mouse. (Turn on ""Mouse Keys Mode v2"") I find this slightly more convenient than a mouse most of the time, but the big win is that I can use my computer when a bluetooth mouse disconnects.</li>
<li>Other stuff while holding s: (add&nbsp;<a href=""https://gist.github.com/paulfchristiano/77077c0a0a9094bfc6802271907608aa"">this gist</a>&nbsp;to your private.xml): 
<ul>
<li>While holding s: u/o move to the previous and next word, n is backspace.&nbsp;</li>
<li>While holding s+f: key repeat is 10x faster.</li>
<li>While holding s+a: hold shift (so cursor selects whatever it moves over, e.g. I can quickly select last ten words by holding a+s+f and then holding u for 1 second).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I'd definitely pay &gt; a minute a day for these changes.</p>
<h2>Keyboard</h2>
<p>I find split+tented keyboards much nicer than usual keyboards. I use a&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009ZNBJBM/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1"">Kinesis Freestyle 2</a>&nbsp;with <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/VIP3-Accessory-Kinesis-Freestyle2-Keyboard/dp/B008BVNQW4/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1499635913&amp;sr=8-1-fkmr0&amp;keywords=Kinesis+Freestyle2+VIPTM+Accessory+Features+AC820-BLK+%28Keyboard+sold+Separately%29"">this</a> to prop it up. I put my touchpad on a raised platform between the keyboard halves. Alternatively, you might prefer the <a href=""http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/comfortable-ergo-keyboard/"">wire cutter's recommendations</a>.</p>

<h2>Vimflowy</h2>
<p><a href=""http://vimflowy.bitballoon.com/"">Vimflowy</a>&nbsp;is similar to&nbsp;<a href=""/workflowy.com"">Workflowy</a>, with a few changes:&nbsp;it lets you ""clone"" bullets so they appear in multiple places in your document, has marks that you can jump to easily, and has much more flexible motions / macros / etc. I find all of these very helpful. The biggest downside for most people is probably modal editing (keystrokes issue commands rather than inserting text).</p>
<p>The biggest value add for me is the time tracking plugin. I use vimflowy essentially constantly, so this gives me extremely fine-grained time tracking for free.</p>
<p>Running locally (<a href=""https://github.com/wuthefwasthat/vimflowy"">download from github</a>) lets you use vimflowy offline, and using the SQLite backend scales to very large documents (larger than workflowy can handle).</p>

<h2>ClipMenu [hard to get?]</h2>
<p>Keeps a buffer of the last 20 things you've copied, so that you can paste any one of them. Source for OSX is on github&nbsp;<a href=""https://github.com/naotaka/ClipMenu"">here</a>, I'm not sure if it can be easily compiled/installed (binaries used to be available). Would be curious if anyone knows a good alternative or tries to compile it.</p>

<p>I</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, I listened to a podcast from <a href=""http://freakonomics.com/archive/"">Freakonomics Radio</a> that purported to ask the question, <a href=""http://freakonomics.com/podcast/rich-less-generous-than-poor/"">Are The Rich Less Generous Than The Poor?</a></p>
<p>A clever researcher decided he wanted to measure altruism. He&#8217;s tried testing it in the laboratory, but lab settings are often importantly different than the outside world, so he wanted to do an experiment in &#8216;the field&#8217;.</p>
<p>His idea was that he would pose as a postal worker in The Netherlands, and drop off envelopes addressed to someone else, with the envelope window showing visible cash money, up to 20 euros, along with a card like &#8220;thanks to Grandpa on his birthday.&#8221; He then waited to see how many rich and poor people returned the envelopes.</p>
<p>He found, to his surprise, that rich people returned far more of the envelopes than the poor. One thing he noted was that rich people returned the envelope at the same rate regardless of how much money was there, whereas the poor were more likely to return 10 euros than 20 euros, but he still essentially disbelieved the result.</p>
<p>To his credit, he still presented his findings at a conference, even though they were in conflict with his priors and the agenda pretty much everyone is trying to push these days.</p>
<p>Then Steven Levitt of <a href=""https://smile.amazon.com/Freakonomics-Economist-Explores-Hidden-Everything/dp/0060731338/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1503229254&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=freakanomics+book"">Freakonomics</a> fame got up, and said you aren&#8217;t measuring altruism, you&#8217;re measuring who has the life skills and available time to return misaddressed envelopes.</p>
<p>Story checked out, at least to some extent. Rich people were more likely to know how to return an envelope or to have the time to do so. The findings were adjusted for this variable, and a new story emerged that rich and poor were exactly equally generous. What a coincidence!</p>
<p>My instincts tell me that if you issue a correction for an unexpected and hard to measure hidden variable, ignoring many other potential hidden variables and differences, and your result is now to find no result at all, there are two possibilities. Either your study is under-powered and you&#8217;re saying &#8216;no effect&#8217; when you mean &#8216;the effect isn&#8217;t that large,&#8217; or you &#8220;corrected&#8221; for the variable in a way that effectively assumed it was the entire difference.</p>
<p>Rich and poor differ in lots of different ways. There are reasons to think poor people would be more generous, and reasons to think rich people would be more generous. Neither result would surprise me. The idea that you&#8217;ve found one of those reasons, decided <em>that reason doesn&#8217;t really count, </em>and then miraculously <em>all the other reasons exactly cancel out</em>? <a href=""http://unsongbook.com/"">TINACBNIEAC</a>. <a href=""http://www.physicsoftheuniverse.com/topics_bigbang_accelerating.html"">Omega doesn&#8217;t happen to equal one by happy accident</a>. You did that.</p>
<p>Those mistakes are illustrative and important. It&#8217;s good to see them in a low-stakes place where all participants are truth seeking and admit their errors once the errors are found. Ten points for all!</p>
<p>The most important mistake was that returning a lost envelope isn&#8217;t only not <em>effective </em>altruism. It mostly isn&#8217;t altruism at all.</p>
<p><span id=""more-10285""></span></p>
<p>Returning a lost envelope is honesty. Returning a lost envelope is honor. You return the envelope because it <em>isn&#8217;t yours. </em>It belongs to someone else and it is your honor-bound duty to make sure that it reaches its intended destination, to the extent that you are willing to go out of your way to do so even if the cost to you in lost time exceeds the expected benefits to the recipient of this particular envelope. You are defending the system, upholding the public trust, and reinforcing the habits that make you the person you want to be.</p>
<p>Returning the envelope isn&#8217;t <em>entirely </em>not about altruism. You certainly can feel compassion for the person who is about to lose money, to worry about the relatives who will argue over what happened to the envelope and who forgot whose birthday. You could have the argument over whether it would be better to do that or to donate the money to mosquito nets or existential risk prevention. If you do have that argument, even in your mind, to me you are already lost, because it&#8217;s beside the post. <em>The envelope isn&#8217;t yours. Give it back. </em>That&#8217;s all there is to it.</p>
<p>I am not claiming it is <em>never </em>right to take what is not yours. I am not arguing for death before dishonor. I am not arguing against it, either. That&#8217;s beyond scope. I am simply saying that in such a context, it should completely dominate the calculus.</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>Effective altruists are trying to do good. We salute you for that.</p>
<p>We even salute you even when you are worried about things I do not care about <em>at all. </em>Even when they pursue plans that would actually be a negative for me, and make my life noticeably worse. Even when they pursue plans that would be both pointless and catastrophic, proposing killing off wildlife or collapsing physics.</p>
<p>We even salute you when we think that it&#8217;s more than a little worrisome that your statements logically imply you really should be trying to wipe out humanity. Even when I think they&#8217;re completely wrong and have made rather silly and fundamental errors. You&#8217;re trying to do good, and at least for now all such people claim to have the &#8216;but killing people or using force to do that would still be bad&#8217; hack going on, although that has a shaky historical track record under pressure.</p>
<p>Charity and non-profit work is one path to doing good, and optimizing its impact is a great idea on the margin. Some of you should do that.</p>
<p>Some of you should do the other. They have the more important job.</p>
<p>What concerns me about the culture of effective altruism is the implication that the altruistic actions are the ones that count.</p>
<p>I worry many in EA are looking at life like a game where giving money to charity is how the world scores victory points.</p>
<p>I worry that others in EA are looking at life like a game where giving money to charity is how the world <em>saves lives</em>, and <em>saving lives</em> is how you score victory points. You can also substitute prevent suffering, or other such worthy (and unworthy) causes.</p>
<p>I am not saying to stop giving money to charity*, stop saving lives or stop preventing suffering. I am saying that this is not The Good, how good is primarily done, how most victory points are scored, or what the game of life is or should be about.</p>
<p>Life is mostly about getting things done. Most good is done on the object level, and most of it is done for other reasons. A lot of it is done for profit or survival. A lot is done for love and friendship. A lot is done for status, for your tribe, for fame, for sex or for power. A lot is done because of curiosity, or because it is interesting, or because it is the virtuous thing to do. A lot is done because of how it would look if you didn&#8217;t do it, and people found out. A lot is done because it&#8217;s bothering the heck out of someone that it isn&#8217;t being done, to prove that it can be done, or simply because it&#8217;s there. A lot is done incidentally while doing something else; simply going out and doing things tends to create lots of positive side effects.</p>
<p>There are also some reasons that are less fine, but I think even they are far less not fine than people act like they are.</p>
<p>Stop <em>feeling bad </em>about doing things for those reasons. As long as you&#8217;re doing good, those reasons are absolutely fine. All of them. <strong>Yay motivation</strong>. Object level stuff has to get done. Life must go on, so must the show and so must business. People need to stay motivated to do things.</p>
<p>Stop <em>feeling bad </em>about not sacrificing everything including exploration, and doing the theoretical maximum amount of good on the margin. Jesus told us, take all you have and give it to the poor, as a suggestion to improve behavior on the margin, and anchor us. <em>He correctly assumed almost no one would do that. It would not even be good if everyone did that, even if they did the sane William MacAskill version of that and kept the bare minimum. </em>He knew that some people had to keep on doing the productive work, and getting rewarded for that, at least until some big changes happened. He didn&#8217;t actually want <em>everyone </em>to do it, and he also didn&#8217;t want everyone to <em>feel bad about not doing it. </em></p>
<p>The most impactful and successful charity in the world is Amazon.com.</p>
<p><strong>Most importantly, for the love of utility,</strong> <em><strong>stop making other people feel bad about this, and stop using manipulative techniques to steer them towards what you think is more effective at scoring the world some victory points</strong>. </em>I understand the temptation. I really do. To not do this, from a certain utilitarian point of view, is to implicitly say that you value your own scrupulousness and honor, or the feelings and abstract accuracy of those you are interacting with, more than you value <em>saving human lives. </em>Tough sell. Again, I really do get it.</p>
<p>We still have to do it. We still have to protect The Mission. EA is good to the extent that it shares with us The Mission. The other way lies madness.</p>
<p>You say people gonna die. I agree. Sad. Balance is tricky. Death rate stable at 100%. We should fund further research. We should fix it. This is not The Way.</p>
<p>It is also <em>not </em>the Official Party Line of EA. I&#8217;ll get to that at the end.</p>
<p>It is tricky to balance giving the right encouragements and rewards to those who do hugely ambitious projects, altruistic and otherwise, while also giving ordinary efforts the credit and honor they deserve, as well. Certainly, though, we need to <em>stop feeling bad </em>about doing <em>better than almost everyone. </em>More than that, we should <em>make people feel good </em>when they are doing <em>better than almost everyone. </em>Hell, we should probably do that even if they&#8217;re doing <em>way worse</em> than that!</p>
<p>I apologize to anyone who got the impression <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/08/12/what-is-rationalist-berkleys-community-culture/"">from last week&#8217;s post</a> that they are bad and they should feel bad, simply because they weren&#8217;t out there saving the world, or they were not ambitious enough. Please do not do that. All that I ask is that you honor those who do set out to do so, and continue to seek what is true. Based on who has commented on this blog so far, I can say with high confidence and no known exceptions: You are not bad, nor should you feel bad.</p>
<p>I suspect that in some sense, rather than feeling <em>bad </em>one should instead feel what some traders call <em>sad. </em>You can be <em>sad </em>that you&#8217;re not doing more, because doing more would be great, without it being an ethical issue that more wasn&#8217;t done. No blame is assigned. You&#8217;re simply expressing the fact that more being done would have been better, and it would have been (or would be) nice to do more. If you bet on your favorite team, either you lose (and are sad you bet at all) or win (and are sad you didn&#8217;t bet more). It can&#8217;t be helped. Sad!</p>
<p>Que this week&#8217;s Quote That Should Freak You Out:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>(I had been avoiding the 80,000 Hours people out of embarrassment after their career analyses discovered that <a href=""https://80000hours.org/2015/07/if-you-want-to-save-lives-should-you-study-medicine-probably-not/"">being a doctor was low-impact</a>, but by bad luck I ended up sharing a ride home with one of them. I sheepishly introduced myself as a doctor, and he said “Oh, so am I!” I felt relieved until he added that he had stopped practicing medicine after he learned how low-impact it was, and gone to work for 80,000 Hours instead.)</em></p></blockquote>
<p>&#8212; Scott Alexander</p>
<p>This is insane on a <em>minimum </em>of three levels.</p>
<p>The first level is that <em>Scott Alexander is feeling bad about being a doctor. </em>On the list of &#8216;people who have done the most for EA&#8217; he is probably not number one right now, but if he ended up at the top by doing what he&#8217;s already doing I would not be terribly surprised.</p>
<p>Scott Alexander is doing a <em>hell </em>of a lot of good, both for his patients and for other people, and the work he does as a doctor is vital to that.</p>
<p>Scott&#8217;s work as a doctor, seeing patients, experiencing how the other almost everyone lives, is vital to the jobs he does advocating and writing. Scott provides lots of value with his in-depth discussions of research, of drugs, of treatments, of how to deal with various problems and safely interact with various questionable ideas for self-modification. Having someone in our space that fills that role is incredibly valuable for its own sake, and having it be Scott allows those people to find his blog, find each other and be exposed to our ideas including EA.</p>
<p>The last thing Scott should be thinking about is not practicing because it&#8217;s eating too much time that could be used elsewhere.</p>
<p>The second level is that <em>someone else quit being a doctor to do career counseling, because being a doctor wasn&#8217;t impactful enough.</em></p>
<p>It is one thing for a person to decide <em>not to study medicine </em>because what they want to do is save lives, and it isn&#8217;t the best way to save lives. I totally, totally get that. Learning to be a doctor is often a decade of misery, during which you are earning little, and by going to medical school you are taking a slot that could have been used by someone else. The link makes some good points, although it seems to be slanting its presentation to justify its conclusion.</p>
<p>It is <em>entirely another thing </em>to <em>quit practicing medicine after getting your license to go work for 80,000 hours instead </em>because you don&#8217;t think you are saving enough lives.</p>
<p>The calculation is completely different once you are already a practicing doctor. [EDIT: Note that 80,000 hours full analysis does realize that these cases are very different, and recommends that already trained doctors not quit, as is pointed out in the comments.]</p>
<p>That decade of work you were looking at before you could help much or earn much money? Already completed.</p>
<p>That slot in medical school? It&#8217;s gone. That slot in residency? Also gone. No one will replace you. There will be one less doctor. Yes, that&#8217;s stupid, we should train lots more doctors, and that would be a Worthy Cause to lobby for, but for now we don&#8217;t and that&#8217;s not changing soon.</p>
<p>The system spent a quite large amount of money on training you, and all of that is gone now. Demand will exceed supply by that much more, prices will rise to clear the market. More doctors will opt out of insurance, especially Medicaid and Medicare. More people will be unable to afford care, or find themselves bankrupted. The government will be under that much more burden to pay the higher fees.</p>
<p>It seems hard to me to look at a profession where the skeptical view is that you create four years of healthy life for every year you work, and you get one of the highest pay scales, and where no one can legally replace you if you quit, and where high costs from lack of supply are threatening to strangle the entire economy, and which gives you a high level of trust and a potential strong public platform, <em>as something you have an ethical motivation to quit so you can spend more time telling other people what their ethical motivations are.</em></p>
<p>I am not saying that this former doctor is bad and should feel bad. I am certainly not saying that going to medical school is an implicit social contract that then obligates you to use that degree to help others. Even if I believed them, I would not have any social right to make such claims. Certainly there are good reasons to decide not to practice medicine, including simply no longer being interested in the practice of medicine. If the true justification was that staying wasn&#8217;t sufficiently ethical due to opportunity cost, that makes me quite sad.</p>
<p>The third is the level discussed earlier &#8211; even if being a doctor is not locally victory-point-maximizing-on-the-margin it&#8217;s pretty terrible to go around putting so much implicit pressure on well-meaning people that <em>doctors start avoiding you out of the shame of continuing to practice. </em>Seriously, everyone. Cut it out.</p>
<p>III</p>
<p>Scott then ends where I will end, on the Official Party Line:</p>
<blockquote><p>And one more story.</p>
<p>I got in a chat with one of the volunteers running the conference, and told him pretty much what I’ve said here: the effective altruists seemed like great people, and I felt kind of guilty for not doing more.</p>
<p>He responded with the official party line, the one I’ve so egregiously failed to push in this blog post. That effective altruism is a movement of ordinary people. That its yoke is mild and it accepts everyone. That not everyone has to be a vegan or a career researcher. That a commitment could be something more like just giving a couple of dollars to an effective-seeming charity, or taking the <a href=""https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/?refer=ssc"">Giving What We Can</a> pledge, or signing up for <a href=""http://effectivealtruism.org/?refer=ssc"">the online newsletter</a>, or just going to an local <a href=""https://eahub.org/groups"">effective altruism meetup group</a> and contributing to discussions.</p>
<p>And I said yeah, but still, everyone here seems <i>so</i> committed to being a good person – and then here’s me, constantly looking over my shoulder to stay one step ahead of the 80,000 Hours coaching team, so I can stay in my low-impact career that I happen to like.</p>
<p>And he said – no, absolutely, stay in your career right now. In fact, his philosophy was that you should do exactly what you feel like all the time, and not worry about altruism at all, because eventually you’ll work through your own problems, and figure yourself out, and then you’ll just naturally become an effective altruist.</p>
<p>And I tried to convince him that no, people weren’t actually like that, practically <i>nobody</i> was like that, maybe he was like that but if so he might be the only person like that in the entire world. That there were billions of humans who just started selfish, and stayed selfish, and never declared total war against suffering itself <i>at all</i>.</p>
<p>And he didn’t believe me, and we argued about it for ten minutes, and then we had to stop because we were missing the “Developing Intuition For The Importance Of Causes” workshop.</p>
<p>Rationality means believing what is true, not what makes you feel good. But the world has been really shitty this week, so I am going to give myself a one-time exemption. I am going to believe that convention volunteer’s theory of humanity. <i>Credo quia absurdum; certum est, quia impossibile</i>. Everyone everywhere is just working through their problems. Once we figure ourselves out, we’ll all become bodhisattvas and/or senior research analysts.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Official Party Line is saying that the heroic values are optional. This is a movement of ordinary people, its yoke is mild and it accepts everyone.</p>
<p>Sorry. The Official Party Line is bullshit. It is philosophical bullshit. The people saying the Official Party Line are saying it because it helps spread the movement, rather than because it is true. This is what they <em>have </em>to say in the pitch meeting. This is what you <em>have </em>to tell the people who aren&#8217;t ready to give everything they have. You don&#8217;t say, &#8220;We are Out To Get You for every waking moment of your entire life, because doing less is letting children die&#8221; if you want to succeed. So you make sure not to say that.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t have to be explicit. The logic of the movement implies it. Its culture implies it. Every interaction carries this undertone. Every action has the whispered motivation, &#8216;how can we make people give more of themselves&#8217;? Occasionally someone explicitly says that a night out drinking with your friends is tantamount to negligent homicide. The Life You Can Save isn&#8217;t exactly subtle.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t have to be a vegan? Technically you don&#8217;t. In practice, if you touch on the community and aren&#8217;t vegan, you will get into fights and conversations about it. People will think less of you, and give you the impression you are bad and you should feel bad. Lots of people I know spend lots of time worrying exactly how vegan they need to be. <a href=""https://medium.com/incerto/the-most-intolerant-wins-the-dictatorship-of-the-small-minority-3f1f83ce4e15"">Either your EA gathering is vegan, or it has a bunch of fighting about it not being vegan</a>.</p>
<p>People pick up on all that. They follow this presumptions to their logical conclusions. One of those conclusions is to push others as hard as you can. <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/07/25/complexity-is-bad/"">Choices Are Bad</a>, and many realize that under such conditions they are doomed to feel bad, so they look for solutions. Stopgaps are attempted, to contain the damage, like the Giving What We Can pledge. They help, sometimes. It&#8217;s a hard problem, and I&#8217;m sympathetic; I don&#8217;t think anyone is being malicious about this.</p>
<p>Life is mostly about life. That&#8217;s how and why it works and why we have nice things. Having nice things and selfish people trying to get them needs to take up a huge portion of GDP to make the system work and incidentally give us the power to help out with other stuff on the margin. Most people will start selfish and mostly stay selfish. It&#8217;s fine. Better than fine. If that hadn&#8217;t resulted in indoor pluming, industrialization and electronics, I wouldn&#8217;t be typing this, or even exist.</p>
<p>My model of EA is that it was originally founded by a few people who had money they wanted to give away, and wanted to make sure the money did as much good as possible, so they set out to analyze that question. That was insanely great. One of the things that kept it great was the framing that there was a certain budget to do the most good with, so it was time to focus on figuring out what was true. Once you put &#8216;how big is your budget&#8217; into the mix, that starts to be the knob most attractive to try and turn, and the dangers of culture drift towards what is persuasive are upon you.</p>
<p>IV</p>
<p>[Author&#8217;s note/edit: Several quite smart people have said this conclusion is hard to parse and they aren&#8217;t sure what I&#8217;m getting at. I agree that it is not as clear as I would like, so if you&#8217;re confused, assume that the point you previously thought I was making is in fact the point I was making, because chances are that you are mostly correct. Sorry. <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/h8/tsuyoku_naritai_i_want_to_become_stronger/"">Tsuyoku Nairitai</a>.]</p>
<p><a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/08/12/what-is-rationalist-berkleys-community-culture/"">Last week</a> I was talking about how a group dedicated to pursuit of truth and saving the world ended up with a different culture and organizing principle, and was mostly accomplishing living life, and noting that this seemed badly in need of fixing. To now say &#8216;life is mostly about life&#8217; and worry about people feeling overly pressured to help others seems to directly contradict that.</p>
<p>To me, it&#8217;s not a contradiction at all. It&#8217;s the same concern. EA started out being about figuring out what charities had what effects, which meant its culture was all about pursuit of truth with a goal of world saving.</p>
<p>In both cases, there was a Worthy Cause, and to accomplish that Worthy Cause required creating a culture that put what is true above what sells. If anyone ever wants my help on a project like this, so long as I&#8217;m not <em>actively against </em>the cause in question, I&#8217;ll at least strategize with you.</p>
<p>Then people involved realized that selling to and recruiting others would actually be kind of neat, allowing more people to focus on what was true and/or the Worthy Cause, making the world a better place. It required some compromises, but that&#8217;s life. That brought in more people, who were more concerned with selling and Worthy Cause and less with truth, and suggested how great it would be if we compromised a little more, and perhaps added this additional Worthy Cause.</p>
<p>In EA&#8217;s case, the good news is that at least this worked, and they&#8217;re now busy moving nine figure amounts to Worthy Causes, and at least some of that is going to the ones I consider most worthy, even if they&#8217;re also distorting them in ways that make me nervous. In fact, it seems likely that <em>it was the very over-the-top actions themselves </em>that largely led to those nine figure sums being moved.</p>
<p>In the other case, the good news is that it at least sort of worked in the sense that the people involved are happier, and people are now giving serious thought and money to Worthy Cause even if they&#8217;re mostly doing it in the wrong ways for the wrong reasons.</p>
<p>Truth is on the defensive these days. So are reasoning and discourse. Speaking the truth causes one&#8217;s voice to tremble more than it should, or than it used to. Many even speak of the post-truth era. My model of why this is happening would be beyond scope. I do feel the need to point out that the compromises seem to be happening in the places and people near and dear to me. That which makes truth-focused groups unique and valuable risks being lost as they are transformed into something else, and we risk passing future points of no return soon.</p>
<p>None of this is easy. Make no compromises and you have no movement. Make too many, or make the wrong ones, and you have no movement worthy of the name.</p>
<p>When you are looking to expand your group, it is <em>hard</em> to say, we&#8217;re going to only do exactly the welcoming things that the people who properly value our mission truly like. It is hard to intentionally <em>not </em>do the things that would attract other smart, nerdy, nice, sexy people that would make our lives happier in the short and medium term, but who do not share the mission.</p>
<p>It is <em>really freaking hard </em>to see nine figure sums being moved in ways that save lives, say <em>the reason we get to move around these nine figure sums is by seeking truth and doing good on our own, so we need to keep doing only that, </em>and trust in that enough. It is super hard to follow the decision theoretic implications that lead to that conclusion. Keeping your end of that deal means refusing to compromise your integrity <em>even in the ways everyone compromises all the time.</em> Even when you believe this means a lot people will die.</p>
<p>The good news is we don&#8217;t need to compromise on truth or say &#8220;<i>Credo quia absurdum; certum est, quia impossibile&#8221; </i>to avoid feeling bad about not being perfectly good. We can care about things that don&#8217;t show up as the maximum direct good done in a utilitarian calculus, do mostly object level things, and still sleep at night.</p>
<p>Believing that everyone will eventually become Bodhisattva and/or senior research analyst is absurd. Believing this will happen on its own is doubly absurd. But <em>we don&#8217;t want everyone to be that. It wouldn&#8217;t even be a good idea. </em>It is safe to not feel bad for spending your time and money doing object level things and enjoying ordinary life. You do not need to make everyone an effective altruist. Mostly you should confirm you do a lot of good, then make yourself effective.</p>
<p>*: The exception is if you&#8217;re not in a position to do this. You need to pay off your debts and get yourself an emergency fund. Seriously. If you are in debt, focus on paying it off, and <em>stop giving large amounts of money away. Please.</em></p>

<p>Style Note: Phrases with Capitalized Words other than that one, that are not links, indicate potential future posts slash ideas for future rationalist concepts, or at least a concept that is (in a self-referential example) <a href=""https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2017/06/06/thingness-and-thereness/"">Definitely A Thing</a>.</p>
<p>I got a lot of great discussion, at this blog and elsewhere, about my post <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/08/12/what-is-rationalist-berkleys-community-culture/"">What Is Rationalist Berkley’s Community Culture?</a> There are a lot of threads worth full responses. I hope to get to at least some of them in detail.</p>
<p>This post came out of a discussion with <a href=""http://benjaminrosshoffman.com/"">Ben Hoffman</a>. I mentioned that I had more places to go next and more threads to respond to than I could possibly have time to write, and he suggested I provide a sketch of all the places. As an experiment, I&#8217;m going to try that, at least for the subset that comes to mind. Even as I finish up writing this, I think of new possible paths.</p>
<p><strong>None of this is me making claims.</strong> This is me sketching out claims I would like to make, if I was able to carefully build up to and make those claims, and if after doing that I still agreed with those claims; trying to robustly defend your own positions is sometimes a great way to end up changing your mind.</p>
<p><span id=""more-9817""></span></p>
<p>In particular, I am definitely <strong>not </strong>claiming <em>the right to make these claims.</em> An important problem is that often people know something, but <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/08/05/something-was-wrong/"">do not have the social right to claim that it is true</a>, leaving them unable to share, defend or act upon that knowledge. As we as a culture become unable to state more and more true things explicitly, this problem gets worse. I have left out some claims that I am not socially safe even saying that I believe, let alone claiming that they are true or claiming the right to claim that they are true.</p>
<p>One thread is to expand on the question of <a href=""http://raggedjackscarlet.tumblr.com/post/129312114638/mythic-valuesfolk-values"">folk values versus mythic values</a>, as I think the original post was pointing to a hugely important thing but got important things about it wrong &#8211; I think that people with only folk values <em>are </em>helping, if you chose your folk values wisely, and should be honored. So we might call this (1A) Yay Folk Values.</p>
<p>A second thread is to address the question Sarah asked: &#8220;What Is The <del>Matrix</del> Mission?&#8221; This deserves not only one but at least two careful and full posts, one (2A) about the mission to preserve our mission and values, The Mission Must Preserve Itself. Preserving your utility function (for both groups and individuals) is hard! If your utility function and culture do not explicitly and expensively protect themselves, they will become something else and eventually end up orthogonal to your original goals. If people decide they don&#8217;t want to go on (2B) The Mission To Save The World or support that mission, I respect that decision, because that&#8217;s not the part that needs to preserve itself &#8211; it follows from thinking carefully about things. What can&#8217;t be compromised are the epistemic standards and values. That&#8217;s what we <em>must </em>fight for.</p>
<p>Thread (2C) would then talk about How the Mission was Lost, as the group allowed its culture and utility function to shift over time, partly through entry of non-core people, but also by choosing goals that were too much about attracting those people, which is doubly toxic to preserving your utility function and culture &#8211; you shift your own priorities in ways that are hard to compartmentalize or contain, and you bring in people with different culture.</p>
<p>The follow-up from some people was, why preserve the mission</p>
<p>One I do intend to get to, because it seems super important is that you sometimes need to (3A) <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/08/26/play-in-hard-mode/"">Play On Hard Mode</a>. A lot of paths <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/08/26/play-in-easy-mode/"">make your life easy now</a>, but make it hard later, because you develop habits and tools, skills and relationships and assets, that won&#8217;t get you what you want, and that incentivize you further towards developing the wrong things. The wrong hills are climbed. You need to avoid optimizing for things, or taking actions, that would subject you to Goodhart&#8217;s Law &#8211; you need to (3B) Nuke Goodhart&#8217;s Law From Orbit. Repeatedly. It won&#8217;t stay down.</p>
<p>Getting what you want is also about avoiding what you don&#8217;t want. This partially answers, if done right, the question of (3C) How To Keep The Wrong People Out. If your keep your thing unattractive to the wrong people, the wrong people who you wouldn&#8217;t feel comfortable kicking out, will self-select out. The ones who still refuse to leave will make it easier on you; you still have to grow something of a spine, but not <em>that </em>much. New York has inadvertently done a strong job of this. The cost, of course, is the false negatives, and I&#8217;d explore how to minimize that without losing what is valuable. This is also related to (3D) Become Worthy, Avoid Power, which is still on my eventual maybe-to-do list.</p>
<p>(3E) Goodhart&#8217;s Law Is The Enemy. It is behind far more of our problems than we realize. Almost all of today&#8217;s biggest and most dangerous problems are related. That is in fact the place I am going, slowly, in the background. There&#8217;s also another track about letting people see how my brain works and (3F) Teaching The Way By Example but let&#8217;s cut the thread off there before I get even more carried away.</p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s (4A) which would be Against Polyamory. You can be busy solving the nerd mating problem, but if you&#8217;re busy solving that you&#8217;re going to have a hard time being busy solving other things, especially if those other things aren&#8217;t helping your nerd mating success. I think that setting aside all issues of whether it makes people happy, whether it is moral and whether it has good long term effects or is good for families, I think it has even more important problems: It is a huge time sink, it hijacks people&#8217;s attention constantly, vastly increasing complexity (<a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/07/25/complexity-is-bad/"">Complexity Is Bad</a>), and it makes anything and everything about sexual bargaining power and status because everyone always has tons of choices and <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/08/12/choices-are-really-bad/"">Choices Are Really Bad.</a> It makes utility function preservation even harder, and it is an example of (4B) Bad Money Drives Out Good. I have some stories to tell about other people in other communities, as well, to the extent I can find a way to tell them here.</p>
<p>At some point I do need to respond to the intended central point Sarah made, and that Ozy reminded us of elsewhere, that the rationalists by themselves don&#8217;t have an especially strong record of actually doing outward facing things, especially for things that are not charitable organizations or causes. There are essentially three ways I&#8217;ve thought of to respond to that.</p>
<p>Response one (5A) is that this is partly because of fixable problems. We should Fix It! Response (5B) is to explain why keeping the projects Within the System is important, and worth having a reduced chance of commercial success. If you can&#8217;t retain control of the company, and the company&#8217;s culture, it will inevitably drift away and be captured, and not only will other get most of the money, they&#8217;ll also steal the credit and the ability to leverage the creation to change the world. That doesn&#8217;t mean never go out on your own, but there are reasons to aim high even when everyone tells you not to; each project has the same problem that the overall culture does. Of course, you&#8217;ll need <em>some </em>people from outside, we aren&#8217;t big enough to cover all the skill sets, even with the non-core people. Response (5C) is that it&#8217;s fine to go out and do things on your own and with outsiders, of course it is, but you need A Culture Of Extraordinary Effort or some such, to make those things actually happen more often, and even in that case (5D) Hire and Be Hired By Your Friends And Network because that is how most people get hired.</p>
<p>Then finally there&#8217;s a question that both points to a huge problem and deserves an in-depth answer: Effective Altruism (EA) seems reasonably on-brand and on-similar-mission, with an explicit &#8216;save the world&#8217; message, so why shouldn&#8217;t the people who want that migrate over there? Then I have to finally face writing out my thoughts on EA, and doing it very carefully (but not as carefully as <a href=""http://benjaminrosshoffman.com/"">Compass Rose</a>, see basically the entire archives and I do not have that kind of time), without having ever been to more than local meetup level events for EA &#8211; I will at some point, but I have this job thing and this family and all that.</p>
<p>Given Scott&#8217;s recent post, <a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/08/16/fear-and-loathing-at-effective-altruism-global-2017/""> Fear and Loathing at Effective Altruism Global 2017</a>, combined with this being perhaps the best challenge most in need of response, the timing seems right to do that.</p>
<p>I have a lot of thoughts about EA. Most of them involve philosophy, and many in EA are pretty deep into that, so it&#8217;s tough to write things that are new and/or couldn&#8217;t be torn to shreds by people who have been over all the arguments for years and years, but at some point we all know I&#8217;m going to do it anyway. So to those people, when you do tear it all to shreds, or point out none of it is new, or what not, I won&#8217;t be offended or anything. It&#8217;s going to take me a bunch of iterating and exploring and mind changing to get it right, if I ever get it right. Just be nice about it!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve said before that I am a big fan of Effective but skeptical on Altruism. I mean, sure, I&#8217;m a fan, it does a lot of good, but (6A) The Greatest Charity In The World is not Open Phil or the Bill Gates Foundation, it&#8217;s Amazon.com, and if Jeff Bezos wants to help the world more, he needs to stop worrying about charity (although if he&#8217;s still looking, I do have (6B) Some Potential New Effective Altruist Ideas) and get back to work. Even when you discount the profit motive, there are plenty of other good reasons to do positive sum things that help others. At a minimum, (6C) <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/08/20/altruism-is-incomplete/"">Altruism Is Incomplete</a>, also it gets more credit for the good it does than its competitors, and when it hogs credit for too many good things, this distorts people&#8217;s thinking. This ended up expanding beyond the scope indicated here.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all well and good to score high in Compassion and Sacrifice, but if you do that by neglecting Honor and Honesty, or even Justice, Humility, Valor or plain old Curiosity, you&#8217;re gonna have a bad time.</p>
<p>To be filed under posts I do not feel qualified to write properly and that would be torn to shreds if I tried, there&#8217;s (6D) Can I Interest You In Some Virtue Ethics? or even (6E) Against Utilitarianism. At some point I want to try anyway.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s some pretty bizarre thinking going on about what is good or worth thinking about. Some of it even involves people in EA.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s the level of weird where one doubts the mechanism, like worrying about unfriendly AI, nuclear war, asteroid strikes or pandemic plagues. This is weird in the sense that most people don&#8217;t think the probabilities are high enough to worry about, but it&#8217;s totally normal in the sense that if a random person believed one of those was imminent they would quite rightfully freak the hell out and (one hopes) try to stop it or control the damage. They&#8217;re weird maps of reality, but the morality isn&#8217;t weird at all. As a group they get massive under-investment, and if we funded all of them ten times more, even if we also did that for a bunch of deeply stupid similar things, the world would be a safer place at a discount price. In this sense, we can all strongly agree we want to &#8216;keep EA weird.&#8217; (6F) Encourage Worrying About Weird Stuff.</p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s the morally weird. Scott pointed to a few examples, and there was some very good analysis in various comments and posts about what the heck is going on there. I think the right model is that these people started by taking the idea that (6G) Suffering Is Bad, and (6H) Happiness Is Good. I don&#8217;t disagree, but they then get more than a little carried away. Then that gets turned into the only thing that matters, and these principles are treated these axioms as on the same level as I think therefore I am or the existence of rice pudding and income tax.</p>
<p>The people involved then saw where that led, drawing increasingly weird conclusions that made less and less sense. After lots of thinking, they then decided to endorse their conclusions anyway. I&#8217;m sorry, but when you are worried that protons are suffering when they repel each other, you screwed up. (7A) Wrong Conclusions Are Wrong. (7B) Life Is Good. I still am a big believer in (7C) Yes, You Can Draw And Use Long Chains of Logical Inference but they&#8217;re pretty easy to mess up. If your chain ends up somewhere false, it&#8217;s time to find at least one mistake. In my mind such people have made several mistakes, some more obvious than others. I&#8217;d start with how you are defining suffering and why exactly you have the intuition that it is so importantly bad.</p>
<p>In general, (8A) The Past Is Not A Dystopian Nightmare, and (8B) Nature Is Not A Dystopian Nightmare. Again, Life Is Good. No one is saying (I hope) that awful things didn&#8217;t happen all the time, or that things could have been better, but I consider saying the past had negative utility as one of those signposts that you messed up.</p>
<p>A big issue in EA, which many have written about and so I have some research I should likely do before writing about it, is (9A) How To Cooperate With Human Paperclip Minimizers. I think not only some of the absurd, hopelessly weird EA causes are orthogonal to value, but also some of the less weird ones. In general, I follow the principle of (9B) Help People Do Things, especially help them figure out how to do things more efficiently, even when I think the things are pointless, so this doesn&#8217;t get in the way too much. I could also just write (9C) Stop Paperclip Minimizing and try to argue that those people are doing something useless, but I do <em>not </em>need that kind of trouble, and I doubt my arguments would be convincing at this stage anyway. Still, I am tempted, I think largely but far from entirely for the right reasons. At some point, one must try to figure out (9D) What Is Good In Life?</p>
<p>A last important thread is the problem of motivation. (10A) Yay Motivation! It&#8217;s hard to get motivated, and it&#8217;s only getting harder. Just about everything we use to motivate ourselves and others is now considered unhealthy in one form or another, and/or a cause of unhappiness. It&#8217;s not that this is wrong, exactly, but we need to get our motivation from somewhere. If we&#8217;re going to withdraw things from the pool of officially acceptable motivations, we need to be adding to it as fast or faster, or we&#8217;ll get a lot of people who don&#8217;t have motivation to do things. Which we have.</p>
<p>A particular focus of this problem is ambition. This problem is hard. Empty ambition is clearly harmful to happiness and motivation, but it can also lead to real ambition, and the things that harm empty ambition seem to also harm real ambition, or prevent it in the future. (10B) On Ambition would address this hard problem, which I ended folding some of into 6B, but deserves a deeper dive. Another way to look at the issue is, we want people to feel <em>a little </em>sad that they don&#8217;t do more or aim higher, or somehow make them prefer doing more to doing less, because we want them to strive to do more, but we also want them to not feel <em>too </em>sad about it, especially if they&#8217;re doing plenty already. Scott Alexander feeling bad about not doing enough is kind of insane.</p>
<p>We particularly want to make sure that people can work on themselves first, put their own house in order, and keep themselves rewarded for all their hard work. We need a robust way to defeat the argument that everything you do is killing someone by way of failing to fund saving their life. Thinking in this way is not cool, it&#8217;s not healthy, and it does not lead to lives being net saved. We must deal with (10C) The Altruist Basilisk. It is (10D) Out To Get You for everything you&#8217;ve got. We must take a day of rest, and (10E) Bring Back The Sabbath.</p>

<hr>
<h2>Autopoietic cognitive systems</h2>
<p>From <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopoiesis"">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The term ""autopoiesis"" refers to a system capable of reproducing and maintaining itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This isn't entirely technically crisp.  I'll elaborate on my usage of the term:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>An autopoietic system expands, perhaps indefinitely.  It will feed on other resources and through its activity gain the ability to feed on more things.  It can generate complexity that was not present in the original system through e.g. mutation and selection.  In some sense, an autopoietic system is like an independent self-sustaining economy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An autopoietic system, in principle, doesn't need an external source of autopoesis.  It can maintain itself and expand regardless of whether the world contains other autopoietic systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An autopoietic <em>cognitive</em> system contains intelligent thinking.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A group of people on an island that can survive for a long time and develop technology is an autopoietic cognitive system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Evolution is an autopoietic cognitive system (cognitive because it contains animals).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An economy made of robots that can repair themselves, create new robots, gather resources, develop new technology, etc is an autopoietic cognitive system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A moon base that necessarily depends on Earth for resources is not autopoietic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A car is not autopoietic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A computer with limited memory not connected to the external world can't be autopoietic.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Fully automated autopoietic cognitive systems</h2>
<p>A fully automated autopoietic cognitive system is an autopoietic cognitive system that began from a particular computer program running on a computing substrate such as a bunch of silicon computers.  It may require humans as actuators, but doesn't need humans for cognitive work, and could in principle use robots as actuators.</p>
<p>Some might use the term ""recursively self-improving AGI"" to mean something similar to ""fully automated autopoietic cognitive system"".</p>
<p>The concept seems pretty similar to ""strong AI"", though not identical.</p>
<h2>Difficulty of aligning a fully automated autopoietic cognitive system</h2>
<p>Creating a good and extremely-useful fully automated autopoietic cognitive system requires solving extremely difficult philosophical and mathematical problems.  In some sense, it requires answering the question of ""what is good"" with a particular computer program.  The system can't rely on humans for its cognitive work, so in an important sense it has to figure out the world and what is good by itself.  This requires ""wrapping up"" large parts of philosophy.</p>
<p>For some intuitions about this, it might help to imagine a particular autopoietic system: an alien civilization.  Imagine an artificial planet running evolution at an extremely fast speed, eventually producing intelligent aliens that form a civilization.  The result of this process would be extremely unpredictable, and there is not much reason to think it would be particularly good to humans (other than the decision-theoretic argument of ""perhaps smart agents cooperate with less-smart agents that spawned them because they want this cooperation to happen in general"", which is poorly understood and only somewhat decision-relevant).</p>
<h2>Almost-fully-automated autopoietic cognitive systems</h2>
<p>An almost-fully-automated autopoietic cognitive system is an autopoietic cognitive system that receives some input from humans, but a quite-limited amount (say, less than 1,000,000 total hours from humans).  After receiving this much data, it is autopoietic in the sense that it doesn't require humans for doing its cognitive work.  It does a very large amount of expansion and cognition after receiving this data.</p>
<p>Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any ""raise the AGI like you would raise a child"" proposal falls in this category.</li>
<li>An AGI that thinks on its own but sometimes gives queries to humans would fall in this category.</li>
<li>ALBA doesn't use the ontology of ""autopoietic systems"", but if Paul Christiano's research agenda succeeded, it would eventually produce an aligned almost-fully-automated autopoietic cognitive system (in order to be competitive with an unaligned almost-fully-automated autopoietic cognitive system)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Difficulty of aligning an almost-fully-automated autopoietic cognitive system</h2>
<p>My sense is that creating a good and extremely-useful almost-fully-automated autopoietic cognitive system <em>also</em> requires solving extremely difficult philosophical and mathematical problems.  Although getting data from humans will help in guiding the system, there is only a limited amount of guidance available (the system does a bunch of cognitive work on its own).  One can imagine an artificial planet running at an extremely fast speed that occasionally pauses to ask you a question.  This does not require ""wrapping up"" large parts of philosophy <em>immediately</em>, but it does require ""wrapping up"" large parts of philosophy in the course of the execution of the system.</p>
<p>(Of course artifical planets running evolution aren't the only autopoietic cognitive systems, but it seems useful to imagine life-based autopoietic cognitive systems in the absence of a clear alternative)</p>
<p>Like with unaligned fully automated autopoietic cognitive systems, unaligned almost-fully-automated autopoietic cognitive systems would be extremely dangerous to humanity: the future of the universe would be outside of humanity's hands.</p>
<p>My impression is that the main ""MIRI plan"" is to create an almost-fully-automated autopoietic cognitive system that expands to a high level, stops, and then assists humans in accomplishing some task.  (See: <a href=""https://arbital.com/p/executable_philosophy/"">executable philosophy</a>; <a href=""https://arbital.com/p/task_agi/"">task-directed AGI</a>).</p>
<h2>Non-autopoietic cognitive systems that extend human autopoiesis</h2>
<p>An important category of cognitive systems are ones that extend human autopoiesis without being autopoietic themselves.  The Internet is one example of such a system: it can't produce or maintain itself, but it extends human activity and automates parts of it.</p>
<p>This is similar to but more expansive than the concept of ""narrow AI"", since they in principle they could be domain-general (e.g. a neural net policy trained to generalize across different types of tasks).  The concept of ""weak AI"" is similar.</p>
<p>Non-autopoietic automated cognitive systems can present existential risks, for the same reason other technologies and social organizations (nuclear weapons, surveillance technology, global dictatorship) present existential risk.  But in an important sense, non-autopoietic cognitive systems are ""just another technology"" contiguous with other automation technology, and managing them doesn't require doing anything like wrapping up large parts of philosophy.</p>
<h2>Where does Paul's agenda fit in?</h2>
<p>[edit: see <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1633"">this comment thread</a>]</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, Paul's proposal is to create an almost-fully-automated autopoietic system that is ""seeded with"" human autopoiesis in such a way that, though afterwards it grows without human oversight, it eventually does things that humans would find to be good.  In an important sense, it extends human autopoiesis, though without many humans in the system to ensure stability over time.  It avoids value drift over time through some ""basin of attraction"" as in <a href=""https://ai-alignment.com/corrigibility-3039e668638"">Paul's post on corrigibility</a>.  (Paul can correct me if I got any of this wrong)</p>
<p>In <a href=""https://medium.com/@paulfchristiano/i-am-not-yet-convinced-that-lack-of-philosophical-understanding-is-a-really-significant-driver-of-fffc0f318a9f"">this comment</a>, Paul says he is not convinced that lack of philosophical understanding is a main driver of risk, with the implication that humans can perhaps create aligned AI systems without understanding philosophy; this makes sense to the extent that AI systems are extending human autopoiesis and avoiding value drift rather than having their own original autopoiesis.</p>
<p>I <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1534"">wrote up some thoughts</a> on Paul Christiano's agenda already.  Roughly, my take is that is that getting corrigibility right (i.e. getting an autopoietic system to extend human autopoiesis without much human oversight and without having value drift) requires solving very difficult philosophical problems, and it's not clear whether these are easier or harder than those required for the ""MIRI plan"" of creating an almost-fully-automated autopoietic cognitive system that does not extend human autopioesis but does assist humans in some task.  Of course, I don't have all of Paul's intuitions on how to do corrigibility.</p>
<p>I would agree with Paul that, <em>conditioned on the AGI alignment problem not being very hard</em>, it's probably because of corrigibility.</p>
<h2>My position</h2>
<p>I would summarize my position on AGI alignment as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aligning a fully automated autopoietic cognitive system, or an almost-fully-automated autopoietic cognitive system, both seem extremely difficult.  My snap judgment is to assign about 1% probability to humanity solving this problem in the next 20 years.  (My impression is that ""the MIRI position"" thinks the probability of this working is pretty low, too, but doesn't see a a good alternative)</li>
<li>Consistent with this expectation, I hope that humans do not develop almost-fully-automated autopoietic cognitive systems in the near term.  I hope that they instead continue to develop and use non-autopoietic cognitive systems that extend human autopoiesis.  I also hope that, if necessary, humans can coordinate to prevent the creation of unaligned fully-automated or almost-fully-automated autopoietic cognitive systems, possibly using non-autopoietic cognitive systems to help them coordinate.</li>
<li>I expect that thinking about how to align almost-fully-automated autopoietic cognitive systems with human values has some direct usefulness and some indirect usefulness (for increasing some forms of philosophical/mathematical competence), though actually solving the problem is very difficult.</li>
<li>I expect that non-autopoietic cognitive systems will continue to get better over time, and that their use will substantally change society in important ways.</li>
</ul>

This excludes a whole lot of properties; size, mass, density, electrical charge, etc. In fact, based on my (virtually non-existent knowledge of physics), I suspect that all fundamental and derived quantities are not emergent properties (I once again reiterate that I don't know physics).<br style=""margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;"" />&nbsp;<br style=""margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;"" />Emergence does not function as a&nbsp;<a style=""text-decoration-line: none; color: #0079d3; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;"" href=""/lw/it/semantic_stopsigns/"">semantic stopsign</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a style=""text-decoration-line: none; color: #0079d3; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"" href=""/lw/j3/science_as_curiositystopper/"">curiosity stopper</a>&nbsp;for me. When I say consciousness is emergent, I have provided a skeletal explanation (at the highest abstract levels) of the mechanism of consicousness. I have narrowed my search; I now know that consciousness is not a property of neurons, but arises from the interaction thereof. To use an analogy that I am (somewhat) familiar with, saying a property is emergent, is like saying an algorithm is recursive; we are providing a high level abstract description of both the phenomena and the algorithm. We are conveying (non-trivial) information about both phenomena and algorithm. In the former case, we convey that the property arises as a result of the interaction of the constituent components of a system (and is not reducible to the properties of those constituents). In the latter case, we specify that the algorithm operates by taking as input the output of the algorithm for other instances of the problem (operating on itself). When we say a phenomenon is an emergent property of a system, it is analogous to saying that an algorithm is recursive; you do not have enough information to construct either phenomena or algorithm, but you now know more about both than you did before, and the knowledge you have gained is non-trivial.</p>

Describing a phenomenon as emergent is (for me) equivalent to describing an algorithm as recursive; merely providing relevant characterisation to distinguish the subject (phenomenon/algorithm) from other subjects. Emergence is nothing magical to me; when I say consciousness is emergent, I carry no illusions that I now understand consciousness, my curiosity is not sated&mdash;but I argue&mdash;I am now more knowledgebale than I was before; I now have an abstract conception of the mechanism of consciousness; it is very limited, but it is better than nothing. Telling you quicksort is recursive doesn't tell you how to implement quicksort, but it does (significantly) constrain your search space; If you were going to run a brute force search of algorithm design space to find quicksort, you now know to confine your search to recursive algorithms. Telling you that quicksort is recursive, brings you closer to understanding quicksort than if you were told it's just an algorithm. The same is true for saying consciousness is emergent. You know understand more on consciousness than you did before; you now know that it arises categorial novum as a consequence of the interaction of neurons. Describing a phenomenon as ""emergent"" does not convey zero information, and thus I argue the category is necessary. Emergent is only as futile an explanation as recursion is.<br style=""margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"" />&nbsp;<br style=""margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;"" />Now that I have (hopefully) established that emergence is a real theory (albeit one with limited explanation power, not unlike describing an algorithm as recursive), I would like to add something else. The above is a defence of the legitimacy of emergence as a theory; I am not of necessity saying that emergence is correct. It may be the case that no property of any system is emergent, and as such all properties of systems are properties of at least one of its constituent components. The question of whether emergence is correct (there exists at least one property of at least one system that is not a property of any of its constituent components (not necessarily consciousness/intelligence)) is an entirely different question, and is neither the thesis of this write up, nor a question I am currently equipped to tackle. If it is of any relevance, I do believe consciousness is at least a (weakly) emergent property of sapient animal brains.<br style=""margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;"" /></p>

<p>To summarize the finding of my previous two part analysis:</p>
<p>There was a study of the recent raising of the Seattle minimum wage and its effects on low wage workers. Everyone who wrote about the paper thought that it showed that the rise in the minimum wage severely hurt the hours and pay of lower wage workers, or thought it was a bad study and should be ignored.</p>
<p>The numbers seemed odd to me, so I took a closer look. I found what appears to me to be a fundamental error. During this period, overall wages in Seattle rose by 13.3%. If you raise the threshold for &#8216;low-wage worker&#8217; by 13.3% between the two time periods, all bad effects from the minimum wage disappear, it looks like nothing bad happened, and low wage workers likely benefited. It also presumably didn&#8217;t hurt Seattle much, since it was booming the whole time.</p>
<p>If anything, the study seems to be providing evidence that, at least in some situations, raising the minimum wage is good, rather than it being bad. It&#8217;s still weak evidence, because Seattle was unusually well situated to handle the change, but it seems important. It also seems like a lot of people have a strong interest in shouting this result from the rooftops, if true.</p>
<p>Several hundred people saw the posts in question, and I got two good detailed comments, both of which essentially agreed with the analysis.</p>
<p>No one told me where I went wrong.</p>
<p>So while I work on harder, more substantive posts that I&#8217;m a bit stuck on at the moment, I&#8217;m going to ask: If no one&#8217;s going to start shouting the result from the rooftops, can someone <em>please </em>explain why I&#8217;m wrong here?</p>

</style></head><body><p>(From conversations with Sam, Abram, Tsvi, Marcello, and Ashwin Sah) A basic EDT agent starts with a prior, updates on a bunch of observations, and then has an choice between various actions. It conditions on each possible action it could take, and takes the action for which this conditional leads the the highest expected utility. An updateless (but non-<a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/1s5/explicit_optimization_of_global_strategy_fixing_a/"">policy selection</a>) EDT agent has a problem here. It wants to not update on the observations, but it wants to condition on the fact that its takes a specific action given its observations. It is not obvious what this conditional should look like. In this post, I agrue for a particular way to interpret this conditioning on this conditional (of taking a specific action given a specific observation).</p>

<p>Conditioning in this way causes the agent to believe that it can never change the probability of its observation, which seems bad for situations like transparent Newcomb. However, it appears you might be able to get past this by having multiple different instances of the agent (in this case one real and one in Omega's head), and doing conditioning on the conditional for all instances simultaneously. This way, one instance can change the probability of the observation for the other instance. However, this seems unsatisfying since it requires knowing where all copies of yourself are in advance.</p>

</style></head><body><p>The idea here is due to Scott Garrabrant. All I did was write it.</p>
<p>Let's say a logical induction-based agent is making an infinite sequence
of decisions, and is using <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1399""><span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\varepsilon""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">ε</span></span></span></span></span></span>-exploration</a>
on each decision. There are two desirable criteria, which are somewhat
in conflict:</p>
<p>First, we want there to be enough exporation that traders attempting
to bet that good strategies would have bad outcomes (and thus prevent
the good strategies from being tried, so that the bet never gets settled)
will lose arbitrarily large amounts of money if they try doing that
every time. This requires that in total, there is an infinite amount
of exploration. For example, if the agent <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""2^{-n}""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mn""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">2</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sup"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: 0.591em; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-texatom"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.298em; padding-bottom: 0.446em;"">−</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">n</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>-explores on step
<span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""n""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">n</span></span></span></span></span></span>, then it is possible for a sufficiently wealthy malicious trader
to bet against a good strategy by enough that the agent will avoid
it every time, without the trader losing all its money, because the
actions it is discouraging only are taken anyway finitely many times.
But if the agent <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\varepsilon""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">ε</span></span></span></span></span></span>-explores on step <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""n""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">n</span></span></span></span></span></span> for some fixed
<span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\varepsilon>0""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">ε</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">&gt;</span></span><span class=""mjx-mn MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">0</span></span></span></span></span></span>, then this is not possible, because each action is
taken infinitely many times no matter what any of the traders do,
so no trader can consistently make some good action appear bad without
losing all its money.</p>
<p>Second, we want there to be sufficiently little exploration that the
agent does not sacrifice a nontrivial amount of value to it. If actions
only have short-term effects, then it is enough for the probability
of exploration to approach <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""0""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mn""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">0</span></span></span></span></span></span> as <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""n\rightarrow\infty""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">n</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">→</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.151em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">∞</span></span></span></span></span></span>, in order
for the agent to behave optimally in the limit (if actions can have
lasting consequences, then this is not enough; for instance, if there
is an action that destroys all value forever if it is ever taken,
then that action needs to never be taken; this directly conflicts
with the first criterion). For example, if the agent <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\varepsilon""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">ε</span></span></span></span></span></span>-explores
on step <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""n""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">n</span></span></span></span></span></span> for some fixed <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\varepsilon>0""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">ε</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">&gt;</span></span><span class=""mjx-mn MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">0</span></span></span></span></span></span>, then it never gets any
closer to acting optimally, but if it <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""2^{-n}""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mn""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">2</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sup"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: 0.591em; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-texatom"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.298em; padding-bottom: 0.446em;"">−</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">n</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>-explores on step <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""n""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">n</span></span></span></span></span></span>,
then its probability of acting optimally will approach <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""1""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mn""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">1</span></span></span></span></span></span> as <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""n\rightarrow\infty""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">n</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">→</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.151em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">∞</span></span></span></span></span></span>.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are sequences that converge to <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""0""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mn""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">0</span></span></span></span></span></span> but whose sum
diverges, like <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\frac{1}{n}""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mfrac""><span class=""mjx-box MJXc-stacked"" style=""width: 0.566em; padding: 0px 0.12em;""><span class=""mjx-numerator"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; width: 0.8em; top: -1.372em;""><span class=""mjx-mn"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">1</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-denominator"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; width: 0.8em; bottom: -0.524em;""><span class=""mjx-mi"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">n</span></span></span><span style=""border-bottom: 1.3px solid; top: -0.296em; width: 0.566em;"" class=""mjx-line""></span></span><span style=""height: 1.341em; vertical-align: -0.37em;"" class=""mjx-vsize""></span></span></span></span></span></span>, so it is possible to satisfy both of
these criteria. However, if there are important differences among
what the agent should do for different steps, then this might not
be enough. For example, if the agent <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\frac{1}{n}""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mfrac""><span class=""mjx-box MJXc-stacked"" style=""width: 0.566em; padding: 0px 0.12em;""><span class=""mjx-numerator"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; width: 0.8em; top: -1.372em;""><span class=""mjx-mn"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">1</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-denominator"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; width: 0.8em; bottom: -0.524em;""><span class=""mjx-mi"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">n</span></span></span><span style=""border-bottom: 1.3px solid; top: -0.296em; width: 0.566em;"" class=""mjx-line""></span></span><span style=""height: 1.341em; vertical-align: -0.37em;"" class=""mjx-vsize""></span></span></span></span></span></span>-explores on step

on steps that are powers of <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""2""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mn""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">2</span></span></span></span></span></span>, then a wealthy malicious trader

amount of money doing this. Thus we should strengthen the first criterion
to ensure that a wealthy malicious trader cannot bet against a good
strategy infinitely many times, rather than that it cannot bet against
a good strategy every time. Thus, for every efficiently computable
infinite subset <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""X\subseteq\mathbb{N}""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.024em;"">X</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.446em;"">⊆</span></span><span class=""mjx-texatom MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-ams-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">N</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>, we want an infinite amount

required to be computable. This, of course, does not allow the logical
inductor to use randomness, or predict uncomputable sequences. The
way traders were defined in the <a href=""https://intelligence.org/files/LogicalInduction.pdf"">logical induction paper</a>, this was
necessary, because the traders were not given access to the output
of the deductive process.</p>

A trader is
a function which takes in <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""n""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">n</span></span></span></span></span></span> and outputs a trading strategy for

By Currying, a trader can be seen as a function that takes
in a number <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""n""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">n</span></span></span></span></span></span> and a list of sentences given by the deductive process,
and outputs an expressible feature combination as above. We can say
that a trader is efficiently computable if this function is computable
in time polynomial in <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""n""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">n</span></span></span></span></span></span> plus the total length of the sentences
output by the deductive process. The definition of exploitation would
be modified in the natural way, and there is also a natural way to
modify the logical induction algorithm, which will satisfy the logical
induction criterion.</p>
<p>As an example, suppose a logical inductor is given access to a sensor
that regularly produces bits based on what it observes in the environment.
We can represent the data from the sensor with an additional unary

<h2>Stable Pointers to Value</h2>
<p>How do we build stable pointers to values?</p>
<p>As a first example, consider the wireheading problem for AIXI-like agents in the case of a fixed utility function which we know how to estimate from sense data. As discussed in Daniel Dewey's <a href=""https://intelligence.org/files/LearningValue.pdf"">Learning What to Value</a> and other places, if you try to implement this by putting the utility calculation in a box which rewards an AIXI-like RL agent, the agent can eventually learn to modify or remove the box, and happily does so if it can get more reward by doing so. This is because the RL agent predicts, and attempts to maximize, reward received. If it understands that it can modify the reward-giving box to get more reward, it will.</p>
<p>We can fix this problem by integrating the same reward box with the agent in a better way. Rather than having the RL agent learn what the output of the box will be and plan to maximize the output of the box, we use the box <em>directly</em> to evaluate possible futures, and have the agent plan to maximize that evaluation. Now, if the agent considers modifying the box, it evaluates that future <em>with the current box</em>. The box as currently configured sees no advantage to such tampering. This is called an observation-utility maximizer (to contrast it with reinforcement learning). Daniel Dewey goes on to show that we can incorporate uncertainty about the utility function into observation-utility maximizers, recovering the kind of ""learning what is being rewarded"" that RL agents were supposed to provide, but without the perverse incentive to try and make the utility turn out to be something easy to maximize.</p>
<p>This feels much like a use/mention distinction. The RL agent is maximizing ""the function in the utility module"", whereas the observation-utility agent (OU agent) is maximizing the function in the utility module.</p>
<h2>The Easy vs Hard Problem</h2>
<p>I'll call the problem which OU agents solve <em>the easy problem of wireheading</em>. There's also <em>the hard problem of wireheading</em>: how do you build a stable pointer to values if you <strong>can't</strong> build an observation-utility box? For example, how do you set things up so that the agent wants to satisfy a human, without incentivising the AI to manipulate the human to be easy to satisfy, or creating other problems in the attempt to avoid this? Daniel Dewey's approach of incorporating uncertainty about the utility function into the utility box doesn't seem to cut it -- or at least, it's not obvious how to set up that uncertainty in the right way.</p>
<p>The hard problem is the wireheading problem Which Tom Everitt attempts to make progress on in <a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.03143"">Avoiding Wireheading with Value Reinforcement Learning</a> and <a href=""https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/0656.pdf"">Reinforcement Learning with a Corrupted Reinforcement Channel</a>. It's also connected to the problem of Generalizable Environmental Goals in <a href=""https://intelligence.org/2016/07/27/alignment-machine-learning/"">AAMLS</a>. <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03137"">CIRL</a> gets at an aspect of this problem as well, showing how it can be solved if the problem of environmental goals is solved (and if we can assume that humans are perfectly rational, or that we can somehow factor out their irrationality -- Stuart Armstrong has some useful thoughts <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=945"">on</a> <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1001"">why</a> <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1008"">this</a> <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=894"">is</a> <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1492"">difficult</a>). <a href=""https://ai-alignment.com/model-free-decisions-6e6609f5d99e"">Approval-directed agents</a> can be seen as an attempt to turn the hard problem into the easy problem, by treating humans as the evaluation box rather than trying to infer what the human wants.</p>
<p>All these approaches have different advantages and disadvantages, and the point of this post isn't to evaluate them. My point is more to convey the overall picture which seems to connect them. In a sense, the hard problem is just an extension of the same use/mention distinction which came up with the easy problem. We have some idea how to maximize ""human values"", but we don't know how to actually maximize human values. Metaphorically, we're trying to dereference the pointer.</p>
<p>Stuart Armstrong's <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1285"">indifference</a> work is a good illustration of what's hard about the hard problem. In the RL vs OU case, you're going to constantly struggle with the RL agent's misaligned incentives until you switch to an OU agent. You can try to patch things by explicitly punishing manipulation of the reward signal, warping the agent's beliefs to think manipulation of the rewards is impossible, etc, but this is really the wrong approach. Switching to OU makes all of that unnecessary. Unfortunately, in the case of the hard problem, it's not clear there's an analogous move which makes all the slippery problems disappear.</p>
<h2>Illustration: An Agent Embedded in Its Own Utility Function</h2>
<p>If an agent is logically uncertain of its own utility function, the easy problem can turn into the hard problem.</p>
<p>It's quite possible that an agent might be logically uncertain of its own utility function if the function is quite difficult to compute. In particular, human judgement could be <a href=""https://ordinaryideas.wordpress.com/2012/04/21/indirect-normativity-write-up/"">difficult to compute even after learning all the details of the human's preferences</a>, so that the AI needs <a href=""https://ai-alignment.com/learning-and-logic-e96bd41b1ab5"">uncertain reasoning about what the model tells it</a>.</p>
<p>Why can this turn the easy problem of wireheading into the hard problem? If the agent is logically uncertain about the utility function, its decisions may have logical correlations with the utility function. This can give the agent some logical control over its utility function, reintroducing a wireheading problem.</p>
<p>As a concrete example, suppose that we have constructed an AI which maximizes <a href=""https://intelligence.org/files/CEV.pdf"">CEV</a>: it wants to do what an imaginary version of human society, deliberating under ideal conditions, would decide is best. Obviously, the AI cannot actually simulate such an ideal society. Instead, the AI does its best to reason about what such an ideal society would do.</p>
<p>Now, suppose the agent figures out that there would be an exact copy of itself inside the ideal society. Perhaps the ideal society figures out that it has been constructed as a thought experiment to make decisions about the real world, so they construct a simulation of the real world in order to better understand what they will be making decisions about. Furthermore, suppose for the sake of argument that our AI can break out of the simulation and exert arbitrary control over the ideal society's decisions.</p>
<p>Naively, it seems like what the AI will do in this situation is take control over the ideal society's deliberation, and make the CEV values as easy to satisfy as possible -- just like an RL agent modifying its utility module.</p>
<p>Obviously, this could be taken as reason to make sure the ideal society doesn't figure out that it's just a thought experiment, or that they don't construct copies of the AI. But, we don't generally want good properties of the AI to rely on assumptions about what humans do; wherever possible, we want to design the AI to avoid such problems.</p>
<h2>Indifference and CDT</h2>
<p>In this case, it seems like the right thing to do is for the AI to ignore any influence which its actions have on its estimate of its utility function. It should act as if it only has influence over the real world. That way, the ideal society which defines CEV can build all the copies of the AI they want; the AI only considers how its actions have influence over the real world. It avoids corrupting the CEV.</p>
<p>Clearly, this would be an indifference-style solution. What's interesting to me is that it also looks like a CDT-style solution. In fact, this seems like an answer to my question at the end of <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1525"">Smoking Lesion Steelman</a>: a case of ignorance about your own utility function which doesn't arise from an obviously bad agent design. Like the smoking lesion steelman, ignorance about utility here seems to recommend CDT-like reasoning over EDT-like reasoning.</p>
<p>This suggests to me that there is a deep connection between CDT, indifference, stable pointers, and corrigibility. As Jason Konek &amp; Ben Levinstein argued in <a href=""http://fitelson.org/coherence/k&amp;l_foedt.pdf"">The Foundations of Epistemic Decision Theory</a>, CDT is about getting the direction-of-fit right in decision theory: you want beliefs to better fit the world (if your beliefs don't match the world, you change your beliefs), but you want the world to better fit your goals (if your goals don't match the world, you change the world). The easy problem of wireheading is to follow the second maxim when you have your utility function in hand. The hard problem of wireheading is to go about this when your utility is not directly observable. If you build a stable pointer to a human, you become corrigible. Doing this correctly seems to involve something which at least looks very similar to indifference.</p>
<p>This picture is a little too clean, and likely badly wrong in some respect: several of these concepts are likely to come apart when examined more closely. Nonetheless, this seems like an interesting way of looking at things.</p>

<hr />
<p>Our company does a few things, but mostly it sells regulatory reporting software to financial institutions.</p>
<p>Bank and financial institutions have to file a shit ton of <a href=""https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=ff5ffbcccee5bacd1898bfbdc347bdd6&amp;mc=true&amp;tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title12/12tab_02.tpl"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">regulatory reports</a>. The crisis of &#8217;08 brought some new regulations in and Trump may take a few regulations away, but there is always a shit ton of them, and more are added each year. Filing these reports requires a bank to round up a lot of data from its business units, clean the data and standardize it, run the clean numbers through a bunch of calculations, and report the results in the specific format that each of the 18 separate financial regulatory entities demands.</p>
<p>This work is boring and annoying, and bankers don&#8217;t want to do it. Sometimes banks have their own people do it using Excel, but then the numbers often come out wrong and the regulators get angry. Sometimes they pay professional consultants to do it for them, but those consultants charge a lot of money and still mostly use Excel. Then those banks buy our company&#8217;s software, which automates the whole thing and produces the report at the press of a button.</p>
<p>Automating regulatory reporting is a weird and small niche, but it&#8217;s quite lucrative. Our company has far and away the best offerings in this niche, along with a 25-year reputation of never having the numbers come out wrong. Since I joined, our New York office grew from 50 people to 150 and our revenues grew from decent to very very decent.</p>
<p>Does this sound like something you had wanted to do since you were a kid? I have a friend who had wanted to be a fashion designer since she was a kid. After years of hard work, she got a designer job at a famous fashion company. She then suffered a succession of horrible bosses and a toxic work environment, until she finally had to quit to preserve her sanity.</p>
<p>My company is the opposite.</p>
<p>Making regulatory reporting software is just as unglamorous and uncool as it sounds. If you want your job to provide status and excitement, this one doesn&#8217;t. And because it doesn&#8217;t, you will be overpaid and underworked while enjoying a stress-free and friendly environment.</p>
<p>There are a supply and a demand for everything, including fashion designers and regulatory software specialists. If there&#8217;s a high supply of designer wannabes, fashion companies can make their employees underpaid and miserable, and still fill all their job vacancies. If there&#8217;s a low supply of regulatory specialists and a growing demand, the specialists will be rewarded with money and happiness.</p>
<p>This is true in any industry. If a company is forced by the law to pay its employees more than they would otherwise, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/yudkowsky/posts/10155545010509228?pnref=story"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">they will then exploit them</a> in any non-monetary way they can. And if a big company offers its employees status, excitement <em>and</em> a ton of money, they will show their relative power in other ways. For example, <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/corporations-are-cracking-down-on-free-speech-inside-the-office--and-out/2017/08/10/6a98809a-7baf-11e7-a669-b400c5c7e1cc_story.html?utm_term=.381478123d71"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">by policing what its employees are allowed to say</a>.</p>
<p>But freedom and diversity aren&#8217;t just results of supply and demand, they also depend on the company culture.</p>
<hr />
<p>Our company is really, really diverse. My colleagues are men and women, gay and straight, Ukrainians and Nigerians, 17-year-old interns and a 69-year-old expert who knows more about regulations than the regulators. They are atheists, church-goers, and Orthodox Jews. And, rarest of all, they have a real diversity of opinions.</p>
<p>Since I&#8217;m a friendly guy and my opinions on most topics are too weird to explain, my coworkers feel comfortable talking with me. One day I was waiting by the coffee machine and a colleague told me that Trump made a good call about transgenders in the military because transgender people are just attention seeking cross-dressers. Another day while I was waiting for coffee a different colleague told me that all cops are sadistic racists who get off on beating black kids. And yet another day while I was waiting for coffee, a colleague told me that the moon landings were faked.</p>
<p>The machine makes good coffee, but sometimes it really takes a long while.</p>
<p>Anyway, you might wonder how the company can tolerate such <em>actual</em> diversity without the office being incinerated by culture wars. The way we do it is the way any person can protect themselves from being incinerated by culture wars: <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/identity.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">keeping your identity small</a>.</p>
<p>Our company doesn&#8217;t have an official position on transgender people, police violence, or the moon landings. Because there&#8217;s no official position, there&#8217;s no reason to fight over these issues within the company &#8211; there&#8217;s nothing to be won or lost. Most importantly, our company doesn&#8217;t have public forums for discussing our position on all of those issues. And that&#8217;s crucial because what can be tolerated in private conversation can&#8217;t be tolerated in a public forum.</p>
<p>Every day during lunch break some of my colleagues eat fried chicken and talk about what they read on Breitbart. Another group goes to the organic quinoa bowl place to talk about what they watched on Vice. The moon hoax guy doesn&#8217;t really have anyone to talk to about moon hoaxes, so he&#8217;s free to eat wherever he wants. After the lunch break, everyone comes back to work together on regulatory software and doesn&#8217;t worry about politics and culture wars.</p>
<p>Everyone has a good guess about what everyone else&#8217;s opinions are, but no one makes a fuss or feels threatened by those opinions. I bet you have an uncle or a grandma that believe in some crazy shit, but you still get along with them.</p>
<p>What would happen if our company had an official forum for discussing our attitudes about transgender people? The person who doesn&#8217;t think transgender people exist might post something about it. The quinoa people who are otherwise happy to ignore this will have to respond vociferously, because <strong>once something becomes public knowledge you have to respond to it, otherwise you condemn yourself.</strong></p>

<p>#googlememo was written a few weeks before any of us knew about it. If no one outside of a few Googlers had ever heard of it, Damore would still be writing software alongside Google&#8217;s excellent female engineers. But once everyone knew about the memo, and once <em>everyone knew that everyone knows</em> about the memo, the issue became a question of Google&#8217;s official position on<em> &#8220;Can women code?&#8221;</em>. Google&#8217;s official position on the topic is <em>&#8220;Yes, we think they can&#8221;</em>, and Damore had to be fired for the official position to be maintained.</p>
<p>My company&#8217;s only official position is: <em>&#8220;The CECL accounting standard should integrate PD/LGD models&#8221;</em>. So, in our company, everyone works on integrating PD/LGD models in CECL and no one really cares what anyone else thinks about hot-button politicized issues.</p>
<p>I thought about this a lot when I read <a href=""https://hackernoon.com/for-inclusive-culture-maybe-less-is-more-87b663662cea"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">this excellent piece</a> by Rich Armstrong. It talks about how in order to have an inclusive company culture, a company should try to have <em>less</em> culture. Some excerpts:</p>
<blockquote><p>J.D. Edwards’ culture and workplace standards came straight from IBM. Jacket and tie were required (for men). If you started showing up at 9 instead of 8:30, it would definitely be mentioned to you. Their marquee perk? Free soda. Casual Fridays were grudgingly introduced as the internet boom made recruiting harder. I loved my job, and hated that dress code and schedule. [&#8230;]</p>
<p>My team at J.D. Edwards was the most diverse I’ve ever worked on. My first boss was an African immigrant, second boss was a forty-something mom. Our team measured high on nearly every dimension of diversity — gender, race, religion, age, parental status, national origin, sexual orientation, disability status, veteran status. They were a talented and hardworking bunch. I hadn’t known any other kind of team, so it didn’t seem exceptional to me.</p>
<p>Still, I just couldn’t get over that damned tie. The internet boom was happening all around me, and I was stuck with a bunch of (incredibly nice and generous) non-hip people. [&#8230;]</p>
<p id=""e5ff"" class=""graf graf--p graf--leading"">I finally got out in 2000. I was giddy. I found a job at a hip software company. Their offices were downtown. My new coworkers were so cool. They wore ironic T-shirts. They showed up at 10 or later, worked crazy hours. On Fridays, and on many other days, they went to drink microbrews together after work, went home to cool lofts, or went straight to indie rock shows.</p>
<p id=""ee46"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">And they were all white, all young, all childless, mostly male. The women were in HR, or QA, or content creation. The dev managers were slightly older white males. The QA managers were slightly older white females. [&#8230;]</p>
<p>See, here’s the thing: there are many ways to build an inclusive environment, and to enjoy the diversity that often follows from it. One great way, that I think might’ve been overlooked, is to keep things professional. <strong class=""markup--strong markup--p-strong"">When our office culture is focused on business rather than socializing, we reduce the number of ways in which we all have to be the same. When we do that, we allow diversity to flourish.</strong> If your culture expects people to work long hours or hang out off-hours, the strain on the people who are different, in whatever way, is increased, and your ability to retain a diverse work force is reduced. [&#8230;]</p>
<p>If you want to build an inclusive culture, build a minimum culture. Build it around professionalism, boundaries, and work-life balance. Make sure your senior staff walks the walk, and spreads the word.</p></blockquote>
<p>In my company you&#8217;re expected to do the following things from 9:15 am to 6 pm: build good regulatory reporting software, be nice to your colleagues, wear business casual. You can get away with a t-shirt, but not with being an asshole or making bad reporting templates. Nothing else you do has any impact whatsoever on your career. This not only makes the company a remarkably pleasant and productive place to work, it also allows colleagues to become friends with people they would never otherwise even have a conversation with.</p>
<hr />
<p>So why am I leaving? Because I actually want some stress in my life. In four years I have learned everything I need to easily do my job well. Now I have a burning desire to do something really hard that I would suck at.</p>
<p>My current role is product manager: I configure new products that I think big banks would need (this involves working within our proprietary software but doesn&#8217;t require any coding), and I demo those products to banks to convince them to buy it. Ideally, a product manager should own both the product and the relationships with the clients who use it. This requires long-term vision and commitment, while my growing restlessness tells me that my time in the regulatory finance industry is running short.</p>
<p>Other than commitment, the job requires analytical thinking, aptitude with software, and preferably some experience in finance and/or in selling things to large enterprises. If you know SQL or accounting, you&#8217;re already two years ahead of where I was when I joined. The office is in New York City, with occasional travel around North America. The job will probably be filled in the next month.</p>
<p>I really like the company, and especially my team. After four great years, the least I can do for them is to recommend a product manager to replace me. Someone who shows their great character by reading excellent blogs.</p>

Here it is:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class=""mail-message-content collapsible zoom-normal mail-show-images "" style=""overflow-wrap: break-word; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 13.696px; margin: 16px 0px;"">
<div class=""clear"">
<div>
<div>Hi Eliezer,</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>I'm contacting you directly because I think I have an idea that could get us closer to obtaining our terminal value(s), and you are in a position of influence but also seem like someone I could possibly influence if my idea is correct. If my idea is wrong at least I'd get a lot out of hearing why.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>First. I think your definition of Terminal Value is flawed. People don't ultimately want survival or health or friendship. I know that because if I asked you why you want survival, the answer would ultimately be because circuitry and chemistry make us. So it'd appear that our terminal values are &nbsp;actionable motivations from circuitry and biology. If we stopped our line of questioning there we'd think our terminal value was that, in which case the optimal path of action would be to find a way to hack our circuitry and biology to give us positive signals. But I don't think we should stop there.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>If you model humans as optimizers of this terminal value then you'd say to people ""you should try to optimize your terminal value"" but it's not really a should because that's already what people do to various degrees of effectiveness. Terminal values aren't ""should""s, they're ""shall""s. The real question here is what do you mean when you say ""you.""</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Let me know if any part of this seems logically unsound but I'm now going to make another argument that I'm still having a hard time processing:</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>""You"" is poorly defined. Evidence:</div>
<div>- That tree over there is just as much a part of ""you"" as your hand is. The only difference is your conscious mind is better at finely controlling your hand than at controlling the tree, but same as how you can cause your hand to move you can also cause the tree to move by pushing it.</div>
<div>- The ""you"" some years from now is made of entirely different atoms yet you don't behave as if ""you"" will be dead when that happens--you still think of that as you. That means ""you"" is more than your physical body.</div>
<div>- If ""you"" is more than your physical body then, the first thing I was saying about chemical and electric signals being our terminal value don't make sense.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>New model:</div>
<div>- We are a collective system of consciousnesses that is in some sense conscious. Humans are like neurons in a brain. We communicate like neurons. We communicate in various ways, one of them language. The brain might have a different terminal value than the neuron.</div>
<div>- Question: what ""should"" a neuron in a brain's terminal value be? Its own possibly faultily programmed terminal value? Or the terminal value of the brain? I think it depends on the neurons level of awareness, but once it realizes it's in a brain and thinks of its ""self"" as the brain, its terminal value should be the brain's.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Possibly the brain is likewise a neuron in a bigger brain but nevertheless somewhere there must be a real terminal value at the end or at least a level to which we are unable to find any more information about it from. I think if we can expand our definition of ourselves to the whole brain rather than our little neuron selves, we ""should"" try to find the terminal value.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Why do I think that we ""should"" do that? Because knowing more about what you want puts you in a much better position to get what you want. And there's no way we wouldn't want what we want--the only question here is if we think the expected value of trying to figure out what we ultimately want makes it part of the optimal path for getting what we ultimately want. From my information and model, I do think it's part of the optimal path. I also think its entirely possible to figure out what the terminal value is if we're ""intelligent"" enough, by your definition of intelligence so the expected value is at least positive.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>I think the optimal path is:</div>
<div>- figure out what the ""self"" is</div>
<div>- figure out what the self's terminal value is</div>
<div>- use science and technology and whatever means necessary to get that terminal value</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>So this is where I ask:</div>
<div>- Are there any words that I'm using in an unclear way? (Often smart people don't actually disagree but are using different definitions)</div>
<div>- Are there any logical flaws in the statements I've made? (I've kept my message shorter than it probably should've been thinking that this length is enough to get the desired effect but I'm extremely willing to elaborate)</div>
<div>- Do you agree with the conclusion I've drawn?</div>
<div>- If yes what do you think we should do next?</div>
<div>- If no I beg of you please explain why as it would greatly help with my optimization towards my terminal value</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>",,,,

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: justify;"">Try this a few times, and you'll stop thinking you can make ""guess[es] about empirical consequences"" (or say anything about empirical consequences (or say <em>anything</em>&nbsp;about empirical <em>anything</em>)) and have people hear anything except you showing off your policy stances. Showing off whom you associate with and what virtues you possess.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: justify;"">Once your eyes open to how hard it is to convince people that your sentences about how markets function are meant to describe how markets function, you give up and stop trying. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: justify;"">Well, if you have the time to convince people you're actually trying to say something about how the world works and not just proudly waving a verbal banner in favor of the home team, </span><em style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: justify;"">and </em><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: justify;"">you have the ability to make interesting a subject so much less accessible and exciting than politics (we've all seen it, haven't we, how little they care once they realize that we really are trying to describe market functions?), </span><em style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: justify;"">and </em><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: justify;"">the time to actually do it properly, all without alienating important people in the process...</span></p>
<p><span style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Then, yeah, maybe. And those sets of circumstances absolutely happen and I'm glad that we do teach each other things.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">But, I really,&nbsp;<em>really </em>understand why most politicians can't do anything remotely like this, and thus, say the words&nbsp;</span></span><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: justify;"">""If people have a right to be stupid, the market will respond by supplying all the stupidity that can be sold"" <em>only&nbsp;</em>if they want people to hear ""I am taking a policy stance in favor of regulation.""</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: justify;"">If you do want people to hear that, then this is a very effective way of communicating that. If you know that saying this will lead people to holding that belief about your stance, then saying it is honest, even if y</span><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: justify;"">ou don't believe that markets work that way. You're not saying/they're not hearing anything about markets, so none of your beliefs about markets can be misrepresented by saying these words. You believe something, you want to honestly communicate that belief, so you use symbols. We think of words as our symbols, but whole sentences can be symbols, too. A sentence has no ""true"" meaning any more than a word does. And if we define that sentence according to the common usage...</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Think through some other possibilities. Maybe you don't believe there's a market for stupidity, but you <em>do </em>take a stance in favor of regulation. If you say you don't believe there's a market for stupidity, you'll knowingly deceive a large group of people (the social thinkers) whom you <em>know </em>will hear ""I oppose regulation"" when you say there's no market for stupidity. In contrast, if you say you <em>do </em>believe there's a market for stupidity, you'll communicate your endorsement of regulation to that group, but will be interpreted as saying something untrue by another group of people who think that you're saying something about market functions and only about market functions and that you've said nothing about your stance on regulation, so wouldn't we be jumping to conclusions to assume anything either way (nerds/empirical thinkers)?</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Most people aren't empirical thinkers (and those that are often aren't when it comes to politics), so as a matter of practicality, politics is spoken in the language of social reasoning. Knowing this, you're shooting yourself in the foot if you listen to these people's <em>words </em>as a way of modeling their beliefs. You have to listen to their <em>sentences</em>, and understand their definition according&nbsp;to the common usage. ""Blah blah market for stupidity blah blah"" is defined as ""I endorse regulation"" according to the common usage (no matter what you substitute in place of the blah blah's).</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">There's a whole music to this social language, and if you start to catch the rhythm, you may find that the absolute garbage that is presidential debates (I use to marvel that the apparently top candidates for president never had anything new or interesting to say, surely such people should be a fountain of insight and formidable competence) resolves itself into something interesting after all. </span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Ah, yes, now I see. First he waves the flag for group X, then he waves the flag for group N. Many people are members of both tribes and feel really connected, while those people who belong to only one are quite tolerant of this particular outgroup. And the members of X who actively oppose group N are disproportionately single-issue voters, so this comes out as an effective appeal as measured by vote-grabbing...</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">It's also interesting to hear new ways of saying ""I'm with them"" over and over again about the commonest groups to appeal to (""God bless America"") or compete over (How can they say ""I support our troops"" more strongly than their opponent? It's a real exercise in creativity). And, of course, amid the majority of people, this is the language of power, and you may find it useful to know how to move within this world, to act upon it, to make yourself respected, and to move people.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Most people (citation needed) talk and think like this <em>all the time. </em>They are social thinkers, not empirical thinkers. <em>Everything </em>they ""know"" about the minimum wage is how to use it as a vehicle for talking about social things, their own status, their group status, and their virtues. Except they don't do so consciously, but automatically. Humans are social creatures, and to think socially, and not in terms of abstract propositions about the function of the world is their first and natural instinct. Always remember, we're the weird ones. Possessors of an inhuman power with a price.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Find some non-nerdy types you may not usually associate much with. Go clubbing and ask all the people wearing something you find appalling their opinions on the minimum wage. After their initial summary of ""I'm with them,"" whichever ""them"" they might happen to be with, inquire a bit more deeply. Go a little Socratic on them and ask about their reasoning, and ask them to confirm your guesses about which observations they would take as evidence for and against their position. You might want to personally note all the times they (it seems to you) change the subject, contradict themselves, or use any of a thousand flavors of fallacy.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Now, review the conversation (which you carefully recorded, of course), but this time, ask yourself if there's any way to interpret each of their statements (which sound like propositions about the function of markets and the nature of human rights) instead as signals about tribal loyalty, personal status, and personal virtue. Write down <em>what </em>these statements might say about the tribe and the person. Incredibly, you may find that what once was a cacophony&nbsp;of contradiction has resolved itself. In another key, it was all perfectly mainstream, run-of-the mill, straightforward, vanilla, dry, unremarkable clarity. Seen this way, the mystery dissolves into something so ordinary as to face-palmingly obvious in retrospect.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">They're just saying how great they are and how great their people are and how awesome they all are and what good people they are. Charming.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">My last discussion of this found many respondents thinking that it was mean to think such lowly things of other people. It is curious to me that they seem to take it for granted that it is lowly. Humans are naturally political; why call our native tongue lowly? There are a thousand stories about the plucky hero who cares about the work, and it's all about the work, and they have to jump over the hurdles that are the regular humans who are into office politics and are so shameful as to not care about the work for its own sake (who do they think they are, not being fascinated with blood spatter analysis or awesome architecture?). Why fetishize this work-over-politics bit? Oh, sure it's responsible for everything lasting that humanity has ever created and all, but...well, as hobbies go, politics is humanity's first and natural choice. People enjoy it; they optimize for it. I'm nerdy and happen to fancy the romance of abstract propositions about reality, but I don't begrudge those who don't feel the same way.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Perhaps more importantly, I need to learn their language, the language of social power, if I am to get them to do what is needful regarding reality despite their native disinterest. Tim Urban's the best speaker our community has, probably, and it still takes all of 2 minutes before it's completely obvious he's a nerd and proud of it. Julia Galef's up there, too, but with a similar weakness when it comes to getting non-nerds to get on board with important political movements. Robin Hanson's alright...</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">But we need a proper Draco. As galling as it is, there is very much a place for a Trumpesque speaker who can get a certain kind of person participating in important things that they...really aren't naturally inclined to care about. We need Steve Harvey and Barack Obama and MLK and <em>someone </em>who can talk to anybody. Or at least who can talk to <em>somebody </em>other than the nerds who are already half-way on our side (and will be more and more as consensus consolidates around the correct answer). </span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">A good map of reality, Knowledge, is power, to bind the universe to our service. But status, respect, prestige. That is the power to move <em>humans</em>. It is, of course, contained within knowledge itself. But the time has come to train the versatile laser focus of knowledge upon social Homo Sapiens and learn how we're really going to get them, all of them (not just the nerds), to save the world.</span></p>",Bound_up,bound_up,Bound_up,

<p>Epistemic Status: Continuing the discussion</p>
<p>Response to (read this first): <a href=""https://srconstantin.wordpress.com/2017/08/08/the-craft-is-not-the-community/"">The Craft Is Not The Community (Otium)</a></p>
<p>Sarah&#8217;s post, <a href=""https://srconstantin.wordpress.com/2017/08/08/the-craft-is-not-the-community/"">The Craft Is Not The Community</a>, was explicitly intended to start a discussion. Her central thesis is that the community has proven itself bad at doing outward-facing projects, so members should do their community-focused projects together, and form a community that can fulfill its members emotional needs, but do their outward-facing and world-saving projects in the outside world and play by the outside world&#8217;s rules.</p>
<p>I want to focus elsewhere, at least for this post, and accuse Sarah of burying the lead. She does not actually bury it &#8211; it&#8217;s right up at the top of the post &#8211; but she views it as background rather than the thing to be focused on.</p>
<p>We need to focus on it.</p>
<p><span id=""more-9452""></span></p>
<p>Her leading paragraph is super important, and I strongly, violently agree with it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class=""p1"">“Company culture” is not, as I’ve learned, a list of slogans on a poster.<span class=""Apple-converted-space"">  </span>Culture consists of the empirical patterns of what’s rewarded and punished within the company. Do people win promotions and praise by hitting sales targets? By coming up with ideas? By playing nice?<span class=""Apple-converted-space"">  </span>These patterns reveal what the company actually values.</p>
<p class=""p1"">And, so, with community cultures.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Those within a culture quickly learn what that culture truly values, and adopt their behaviors to that culture. Culture is super important. If we are building a physical community, and it seems that we are, we should think carefully about what culture we want that community to have, and work to ensure that we get what we want. Keeping what makes us unique requires constant vigilance in the best of times. We are building the community in 2017, and doing so in Berkeley, California. The pressures are and will be unending. Constant vigilance doesn&#8217;t begin to cover it.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html"">Paul Graham</a> once wrote a (recommended) piece called <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/cities.html"">Cities and Ambition</a>. Cities, he observes, have a culture. The great ones push you to work harder, achieve great things. They have a message about what you should be and what is good in life. The city constantly whispers that message in your ear.</p>
<p>He claims that New York, where I live, has the message that you should be richer. Fair enough. He says Boston wants you to be smarter. Again, fair enough. He thinks Silicon Valley&#8217;s message is to have impact on the world, and loves it; I see the real message as more like &#8216;<a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2015/05/15/in-a-world-of-venture-capital/"">you should excite people</a> (with your ability to excite people about your ability to excite people)&#8217; or &#8216;you should spend every hour of your life to follow our script for how to do a great start-up&#8217; or something like that, and can&#8217;t watch the obvious excellent show Silicon Valley because it causes emotional flashbacks. I can see both arguments. Things were likely more as he describes back in the day. We have different perspectives.</p>
<p>What does he say is the message of Berkeley, in a piece from back in May 2008?</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;d always imagined Berkeley would be the ideal place—that it would basically be Cambridge with good weather. But when I finally tried living there a couple years ago, it turned out not to be. The message Berkeley sends is: you should live better. Life in Berkeley is very civilized. It&#8217;s probably the place in America where someone from Northern Europe would feel most at home. But it&#8217;s not humming with ambition.</p></blockquote>
<p>Not heeding this warning, or perhaps because of it, the Rationalists have concentrated in Berkeley, California.</p>
<p>Sarah then reports, back in the present day:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class=""p1"">It seems to me that the increasingly ill-named “Rationalist Community” in Berkeley has, in practice, a core value of “unconditional tolerance of weirdos.”<span class=""Apple-converted-space"">  </span>It is a haven for outcasts and a paradise for bohemians. It is a social community based on warm connections of mutual support and fun between people who don’t fit in with the broader society.</p>
<p class=""p1"">I think it’s good that such a haven exists. More than that, I want to live in one.</p>
<p class=""p1"">I think institutions like sharehouses and alloparenting and homeschooling are more practical and humane than typical American living arrangements; I want to raise children with far more freedom than traditional parenting allows; I believe in community support for the disabled and mentally ill and mutual aid for the destitute.<span class=""Apple-converted-space"">  </span>I think runaways and sexual minorities deserve a safe and welcoming place to go.<span class=""Apple-converted-space"">  </span>And the Berkeley community stands a reasonable chance of achieving those goals!<span class=""Apple-converted-space"">  </span>We’re far from perfect, and we obviously can’t extend to include everyone (esp. since the cost of living in the Bay is nontrivial), but I like our chances. I think we may actually, in the next ten years, succeed at building an accepting and nurturing community for our members.</p>
<p class=""p1"">We’ve built, over the years, a number of sharehouses, a serious plan for a <a href=""http://grist.org/cities/i-want-to-live-in-a-baugruppe/"">baugruppe</a>, preliminary plans for an unschooling center, and the beginnings of mutual aid organizations and dispute resolution mechanisms.<span class=""Apple-converted-space"">  </span>We’re actually doing this.<span class=""Apple-converted-space"">  </span>It takes time, but there’s visible progress on the ground.</p>
<p class=""p1"">I live on a street with my friends as neighbors. Hardly anybody in my generation gets to say that.</p>
<p class=""p1"">What we’re not doing well at, as a community, is external-facing projects.</p>
<p class=""p1"">And I think it’s time to take a hard look at that, without blame or judgment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sarah reports that a bunch of people settled in Berkeley, decided they should live better, and have done a bunch of things to help themselves live better but failed at attempts to do more ambitious outward facing things.</p>
<p>In the comments, blacktrance responds:</p>
<blockquote><p>There are different kinds of community-building, and some of them have more aspects of external projects. At one end of the spectrum, people who happen to live in the same town or neighborhood form a natural community that serves their needs and desires. At the other end, there are clubs formed around specific activities. The “local community”-type doesn’t have many standards beyond living in the area, but the club has them even if they’re not explicit (“If you don’t like reading, don’t join our book club”), and they may even be standards for excellence (“Our chess club is for people with an Elo above X”). A community between the two has to reconcile fulfilling the needs of its existing members with continuing to maintain the goal of being whatever kind of community it is.</p>
<p>I see the rationalist community as somewhere in the middle of that spectrum. It’s not formally about anything like a book or chess club, and there aren’t any necessary or sufficient criteria for belonging, but central nodes in the thingspace cluster include at least general agreement with the Sequences (and other important LW posts), as well as possessing and using a certain conceptual toolbox. It’s also a community that’s tolerant of weird people and contains many of them, but I think to a large degree that’s a consequence of the above, not something independent. If you think about what you really want, take ideas seriously, know and viscerally understand common failure modes, etc, being weird is a likely consequence. And tolerance for weird people isn’t far behind, both because you want to be tolerated and to avoid unknown blind spots (several people willing to be unconventional and compare notes will find more opportunities than one would find alone).<br />
Being that kind of community is a goal – it’s not world-saving, but nor is it purely internally-facing, because it’s not just about serving the needs and desires of community members <i>qua</i> community members.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sarah then responds, in a sentence that should <em>totally freak you out:</em></p>
<blockquote><p>I think that may have been true in 2012 or so, but I don’t think it’s true now.</p></blockquote>
<p>No one could have predicted this. No one had any idea, as it was happening, that the choice of Berkeley might have been a mistake and not only because of the stratospheric rents.</p>
<p>Many of our best and brightest leave, hollowing out and devastating their local communities, to move to Berkeley, to join what they think of as The Rationalist Community. They feel comfortable ripping apart those other communities because they think the point of those communities was to feed their best people to the &#8216;real&#8217; community in Berkeley; when not being careful they use the term &#8216;rationalist community&#8217; interchangeably with &#8216;rationalists living in Berkeley&#8217;. Once there, they have an increasingly good time and develop new ways to have a increasingly good time, forming a real community. But that &#8216;rationalist community&#8217; is &#8216;increasingly ill-named.&#8217; Its central cultural theme is not rationality, or becoming stronger, or saving the world; it is, Sarah reports, an unconditional tolerance for weirdos, a paradise for Bohemians, a place built on warm connections of mutual support for those who don&#8217;t fit into broader society.</p>
<p>The rationalists took on Berkeley, and Berkeley won.</p>
<p>Berkeley doesn&#8217;t work for us. We work for Berkeley.</p>
<p>Huge, if true.</p>
<p><a href=""http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndThatsTerrible"">&#8230;And That&#8217;s Terrible?</a></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/07/20/change-is-bad/"">This is bad</a>.</p>
<p><a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/08/12/choices-are-really-bad/"">This is really bad</a>.</p>
<p>This is unbelievably, world-doomingly bad. It means we&#8217;ve lost the mission.</p>
<p>This is taking many of the people most capable of saving the world, and putting them in a culture focused instead on better living. A culture that, rather than enforcing the mission, is encouraging them to lose the mission. A culture that is such a failure in its outward-facing goals that one of its best and brightest is now suggesting that anyone who wants to impact the outside world should do so without the community&#8217;s help.</p>
<p>Raemon777 (Raymond Arnold) puts it this way in the comments:</p>
<blockquote><p>As Quixote said, the reason I’m excited about *this* community is that it feels like it can in fact play a role in having a strong impact in the world. I’m driving across the country to be there right now because despite all the drama I hear about, the fact remains that whenever I visit the Bay there’s a palpable buzz in the air that “of *course* saving the world is the sort of thing you might do, or which you might try to optimize your socially-rewarding-stuff such that it ends up benefiting the world to some degree. This Buzz was what changed my life, and I think having it matters a lot.</p>
<p>I do think this requires more self-awareness, and requires people to be able to reasonably say “I’m working on this thing that is totally not world saving but will make our home nicer” and not receive subtle vibes that they’re doing the wrong thing.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is super important. It is arguable whether we truly <em>need </em>a social life and a warm loving community in order to save the world, but most of us are not going to give up such things to go off on a mission. Unhappiness and burning out are not the way, and the fact that a community of like-minded people is being constructed that will give us sane ways to save on housing costs and educate our children, while putting lots of great minds where they can collaborate with each other, is an amazing and wonderful thing.</p>
<p>If we keep the mission.</p>
<p>If we keep the buzz that says, of *course* saving the world is not only the sort of thing you might do, <em>it is the best thing to do</em>. Another comment mentioned a great old post about <a href=""http://raggedjackscarlet.tumblr.com/post/129312114638/mythic-valuesfolk-values"">Mythic Values versus Folk Values</a>. We don&#8217;t need everyone to have the Mythic Rationalist Values, but we <em>do </em>need everyone to <em>at least </em>have the Folk Rationalist Values. We <em>do </em>need to require a basic affinity for<a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Sequences""> The Sequences</a>, and at least a good and expanding chunk of our toolbox of thinking skills, where an active quest to acquire said affinity and toolbox fully counts in your first year or two.</p>
<p>A community <em>needs to have standards. </em>A rationalist community <em>needs to have rationalist standards. </em>Otherwise we are something else, and <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/c1/wellkept_gardens_die_by_pacifism/"">our well-kept gardens die by pacifism</a> and hopefully great parties.</p>
<p>Not everyone in our community can or should be out saving the world, but they should <em>aspire </em>to that, to helping with the mission, even as they focus on themselves and their own lives. That should be the thing of <em>highest honor. </em>We need to keep The Buzz. We need to remember what we are about. We need the mission.</p>
<p>That does not mean we should not be welcoming of weirdos; weirdos are awesome. Warm connections and mutual support are underrated and undersupplied everywhere. We absolutely should continue to welcome outcasts, sexual minorities and runaways, <em>if they are otherwise part of our culture</em>.</p>
<p>The problem is that if you are not careful, your culture becomes <em>about </em>welcoming such people. Ideally, the culture isn&#8217;t <em>about </em>welcoming such people, you just <em>do it. </em>It&#8217;s simple. You don&#8217;t have to <em>organize your life </em>around being a kind and decent human being you can just <em>be a decent human being. </em>Then get on with everything else.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you lose the mission, and all is lost.</p>
<p>The point of bringing all these amazing people together is <em>so those people can make each other stronger. </em>It&#8217;s <em>so those people can work together, think together. </em>It&#8217;s so those people can form a culture that makes them their best selves.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s so that the projects we start <em>can use the rationalist culture we have created, </em>as their company cultures. It&#8217;s so that when the outside world wants to capture our mission, and tells us that if we just stopped worrying so much about being technically accurate, we could do so much more, and start us down the standard incentive gradients that are a lot of why (to a first approximation) no one is able to accomplish anything, we can stand up and say no.</p>
<p>That does not mean that every project that is outward facing, or that tries to impact the world, needs to be purely internal. We are not legion, nor are we the only ones who can do anything. The skills and talents and connections and funds often lie elsewhere. There are even places that play by rules similar to our own; I happen to currently work at one of them.</p>
<p>In Conclusion</p>
<p>There is a ton more to unpack, and a lot more important claims that I disagree with, and a lot more detail to explore, but I want to get at least this out there now. I hope to lay out more posts that go into other details.</p>
<p>I want to reiterate that community and happiness are <em>good things. </em>I applaud the construction of a real community, even as I wince at the chosen location and the implementation details. I am glad people have found happiness.</p>
<p>Our short-term and even medium-term happiness is not enough. We have our values. We have our culture. We have a mission.</p>
<p>If Sarah is to believed (others who live in the area can speak to whether her observations are correct better than I can) then the community&#8217;s basic rationalist standards have degraded, and its priorities and cultural heart are starting to lie elsewhere. The community being built is rapidly ceasing to be all that rationalist, and is no longer conducive (and may be subtly but actively hostile) to the missions of saving and improving the world.</p>
<p>Its members might save or improve the world anyway, and I would still have high hopes for that including for <a href=""https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiL06e9_tHVAhWnzIMKHcT2DP8QFghNMAI&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fintelligence.org%2F&amp;usg=AFQjCNFT8I0PsykbB02mluf-Mc86GU30MA"">MIRI</a> and <a href=""http://www.rationality.org/"">CFAR</a>, but that would be <em>in spite </em>of the (local physical) community rather than because of it, if the community is discouraging them from doing so and they need to do all their work elsewhere with other people. Those who keep the mission would then depart, leaving those that remain all the more adrift.</p>
<p>I hope she is wrong, but I fear she is right. If she is right, sounding the alarm now has been a hugely valuable service, giving us a chance to save what is valuable.</p>
<p>If this is indeed what is happening, and I see reasonably strong evidence that it is, then we need to course correct before it is not too late. That starts with a commitment to honor our rationalist values and virtues, and to holding each other to high standards.</p>
<p>If it is already too late, the mission, and those who have kept it, need to go on elsewhere.</p>

<p>Last time, I gave two (related) reasons <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/07/22/choices-are-bad/"">Choices are Bad</a>: Choices Reduce Perceived Value and Choices Force You Into Choosing Mode. Despite not looking like much, these reasons are <a href=""http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness"">Serious Business</a>. They can render us unable to enjoy, think or relax even when it might seem that <a href=""https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwinlL3jlcHVAhVrwYMKHZDuCxwQyCkIKzAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DStTqXEQ2l-Y&amp;usg=AFQjCNHCelAsJe5A5ILeChy7J1PhTgY4jg"">everything is awesome</a>. That&#8217;s what that song is <em>about, </em>really: how great things are, on every axis, when we let ourselves go with the flow and not get distracted.</p>
<p>The rabbit hole goes deeper. It gets much worse.</p>
<p><span id=""more-9229""></span></p>
<p>Choices Cost Willpower and Create Decision Fatigue</p>
<p>Willpower is a controversial topic, and laying out even my simple model would be beyond scope. What matters here is that in the short term, exercising willpower is a cost (whether or not such use has long term benefits). Most of the time, you would prefer to spend less willpower to get the same result.</p>
<p>Often making the otherwise right choice will require the spending of willpower. When you consciously think about eating another cookie, or checking your email, not doing so costs a non-zero amount of willpower. Making that choice over and over could end up not only being distracting via being in choosing mode, but also end up sapping your willpower.</p>
<p>In addition to willpower, Decision Fatigue is a thing as well. Making choices (decisions) is draining something else that is related to but not identical to willpower. At some point, decision fatigue makes further choices carry an increasing cost. Some people have this problem more often than others, but there is always the risk that this will happen to you.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s even a version of &#8216;I&#8217;ve made good choices all day, it&#8217;s all right to indulge now&#8217; that can happen, which is related but different.</p>
<p>You Might Choose Wrong</p>
<p><img src=""https://i1.wp.com/s2.quickmeme.com/img/9f/9f596df5f6a0913eaf7c556801be5c4a72dbd734b624f66e71eb11f8c56a5ccf.jpg"" alt=""Image result for you have chosen poorly"" /></p>
<p>Simple but important.</p>
<p>If you give someone a choice, there is always some chance they will choose wrong. Remember the third principle of economics: People are stupid. They also are often ignorant, or distracted, or don&#8217;t care, or lots of other things. Mistakes are made. No matter how obvious the choice, people will sometimes choose&#8230; poorly.</p>
<p>Thus, giving me a choice between a Snickers bar that I value at $1 and M&amp;Ms I value at 60 cents doesn&#8217;t only force me into choosing mode, lower my perceived value and help create decision fatigue (and potentially cost willpower). It also risks that if I&#8217;m not paying attention or thinking clearly, I will choose the M&amp;Ms, and that would be a tragedy.</p>

<p>Pictured: Someone who has chosen poorly.</p>
<p>You <strong>Will</strong> Choose Wrong</p>
<p>Often you have a decision in the future, and you have a reasonable expectation that when the time comes you will be likely to choose poorly. The reasons are myriad.</p>
<p>You might fear temptation or <a href=""https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjW8Ne6nsvVAhUh34MKHXuzCwUQFggwMAI&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.behaviorlab.org%2FPapers%2FHyperbolic.pdf&amp;usg=AFQjCNF1Yh9P3lBKeohfY3arSPLTVEV4GA"">hyperbolic discouting</a>. You know you shouldn&#8217;t have that snack now, <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/04/22/against-facebook/"">or check Facebook</a>, but you will later if given the chance, and you know it. Or you expect to <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/06/24/on-dragon-army/"">reach a point where your journey gets harder before it gets easier</a>, such as in an exercise program, and you are tempted to quit.</p>
<p>You might expect to be in a social situation where you face pressure to do the wrong thing, such as talking to a salesman, or drinking too much at a party.</p>
<p>You might expect to drink too much at a party, or otherwise be in an impaired state, and be unable to make good choices.</p>
<p>You might simply expect to forget what you currently know, or what you are thinking, or to overthink things, or not care.</p>
<p>You might have a choice where you would prefer result A to result B, but given a choice of A and B, you will still feel you must choose B. More on that later.</p>
<p>In all these situations and more, the choice is doing more than taxing your focus. The choice is going to get you.</p>
<p>Choices Create Buy-In</p>
<p>When forced to make a choice, humans then identify with that choice and need to justify it. Sometimes this is good, and can even be an explicit reason to make (or set up!) a given choice. Most of the time it <a href=""https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi2uracosvVAhWDz4MKHefyAfsQFggoMAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.paulgraham.com%2Fidentity.html&amp;usg=AFQjCNEkETv7iiXCaMdIVvn0FxIBhW1iww"">causes identity to become larger</a> <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/idj/use_your_identity_carefully/"">in a bad way</a>.</p>
<p>You suddenly think whatever you chose was a good idea, and are forced to adjust other beliefs to agree with that. This is especially dangerous when the choice is set up make you feel like you had a voice in the decision. Whichever option you chose, even if it was between two terrible restaurants, two cars that only differ by color, or voting for either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton, starts to seem like it was a good idea. You avoid taking actions or making statements that would contradict your choice. If you had only not had a choice in the matter, you would be free to believe, speak and act correctly later.</p>
<p>Choices Create Blame and Responsibility</p>
<p>Being blamed for things is obviously terrible, and being seen as responsible means you have to do things you could have chosen to do anyway, and if something goes wrong, as Kramer noted on Seinfeld, the first question anyone asks is &#8220;Who&#8217;s Responsible?&#8221; In addition, it means others will slack off, treating the situation as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somebody_else%27s_problem"">Someone Else&#8217;s Problem</a> &#8211; you are responsible! I could explain at length, but we all instinctively know Responsibility Is Bad and Blame Is Bad. At a minimum, <em>being held responsible involuntarily </em>is bad, and <em>being blamed involuntarily </em>is very bad!</p>
<p>If you choose between a Snicker&#8217;s Bar and a pack of M&amp;Ms, it is <em>your fault there is no Snickers bar </em>or it is <em>your fault there are no M&amp;Ms. </em>If all you were offered was a Snicker&#8217;s bar, you&#8217;re the nice one who acquired candy.</p>
<p>Choices force to you to <em>interact with the problem. </em>Interacting with the problem then subjects you to the <a href=""https://blog.jaibot.com/the-copenhagen-interpretation-of-ethics/"">Copenhagen Interpretation of Ethics (link is recommended if you haven&#8217;t read it). </a>You are interacting with the problem, and therefore everything wrong with it is your fault, or at least everything you could possibly have done something about, <em>even if that action would have been absurd. </em>Even if all you did was help.</p>
<p>If you were so lucky as <em>not to have a choice to do anything more to help, </em>then you would be able to interact with the problem without being blamed for it, which would be much better.</p>
<p>You <em>really don&#8217;t want </em>the option to buy a better version you can&#8217;t afford. You might end up buying nothing.</p>
<p>You <em>really don&#8217;t want </em>the option to give away every last dollar you can spare to charity. You might end up giving nothing.</p>
<p>Choices Cause Paralysis</p>
<p>Without any choice you can justify &#8211; you could always do more, in some sense, or always potentially find something better &#8211; <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis"">analysis paralysis</a> sets in. If no choice it satisfactory, the default choice is often to do nothing at all, or sit around thinking and agonizing over things for far too long. This happens even if you know that taking a random reasonable option would be far better.</p>
<p>If you had no choice, or you had less choice such that what you actually want to do clearly dominated your other options, you would be able to take action.</p>
<p>Choices Are Communication</p>
<p><a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/06/28/just-saying-what-you-mean-is-impossible/"">Just Saying What You Mean is Impossible</a>. Every action you take speaks volumes.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t want to come to the party, you&#8217;d much rather not be invited than have to say no. Oh dear, it&#8217;s raining really hard. A shame we can&#8217;t make it.</p>
<p>You would much rather the cancer be inoperable than be given the chance to spend all your family&#8217;s money on a treatment that almost certainly won&#8217;t work and will definitely be painful, for fear of being seen as not caring or giving up.</p>
<p>You would like to sometimes not have access to your phone, so others couldn&#8217;t interrupt you all hours of the day with emails and texts.</p>
<p>Choices Require Justificaiton</p>
<p>I recently wrote a post that explored, among other things, <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/08/05/something-was-wrong/"">the problem of when you know the right choice, but </a><em><a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/08/05/something-was-wrong/"">you don&#8217;t know how to justify that choice or explain your reasoning</a>. </em>There are a lot of reasons why this can be a problem.</p>
<p>Often we have reasons we can&#8217;t fully put into words, whether or not we should have to, and sometimes we don&#8217;t know the reason but we do know we have a bad feeling about this:</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/S74rvpc6W60?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>And yet, that phrase usually leads to the doing of the this in question.</p>
<p>Sometimes our reasons reveal information we need to keep secret, or reveal we know information we are not supposed to know, or which will be unpleasant to bring up. Sometimes everyone already knows, and we know everyone already knows, but we must prevent common knowledge.</p>
<p>Sometimes our reasons rely on information we cannot say out loud. Our society currently says that people who say or believe certain things, even once for a moment, are <em>just awful </em>and anyone who notices such a belief or behavior should notify the internet mobs post haste. Many of these things happen to be both true and central to life, which makes explicit reasoning and justification difficult.</p>
<p>Choices Prevent Commitment, Cooperation and Coordination</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve already noted how the choice to quit can destroy an exercise program or other plan; instead of deciding once it is a good idea, you must decide over and over again that it is a good idea. If you fail even once, that&#8217;s it. All your future selves get a vote, and if you get a tally of 79-1, you still lose. That&#8217;s terrible.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s worse is if there are two of you, and you&#8217;re trying to cooperate on a plan, knowing that a vote of 159-1 also loses. Can you count on the other person showing up, and toughing it out, or will they bail when given the chance? Should you therefore tough it out knowing they might quit? Will they, knowing you might quit on them first?</p>
<p>Now both of you have to constantly track the others&#8217; choices, to make sure incentives align at every step, lest everything fall apart. Both of you need to keep fallback options, not only in case you need them, but to show you have them lest the other party use your lack of a fallback as leverage against you.</p>
<p>This process is more painful than people realize; in many situations it destroys <em>most of the potential production/surplus/utility. </em>Many, many otherwise good ideas, arguably <em>most otherwise good ideas,</em> will not work because trying to do the thing gives others leverage over you that they can&#8217;t give up, so they will reliably take all of your profits. In many cases, due to your sunk costs, they will take <em>far more </em>than all your profits.</p>
<p>Choosing To Stop</p>
<p>This post is an example. I could go on for a long time; this is far from an exhaustive list, but I need to stop somewhere or I&#8217;ll never get it published. Or it will get so long that no one will read it <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/07/25/complexity-is-bad/"">or know which points were important</a>. Or both.</p>
<p>I Had No Choice!</p>
<p>Think about why &#8220;I Had No Choice!&#8221; is so often used. Technically we almost always have lots of choices, but most of those choices would be disastrous. You could give all you have to the poor. You could run naked through the city streets shouting about aliens. You could refuse to get out of bed for weeks on end. You could give the customer a full refund without a receipt. You could shoot that jerk right in the face.</p>
<p>And so on. Most of the time, these are not considered real choices because the consequences are so obviously bad, so we say <em>I have no choice. </em>This saves us from worrying about missing out on the option, and it protects us against blame. You aren&#8217;t signaling anything. You aren&#8217;t reducing anyone&#8217;s status. You aren&#8217;t letting anyone down. You&#8217;re doing the only thing you can. Which is good. Taking away choices is vital.</p>
<p>Others will respond with that awful accusation, <em>&#8220;You Have/Had a Choice!&#8221; </em>Their tone will often be quite unfriendly. You defend yourself. This isn&#8217;t on you. You insist: &#8220;I Do Not Have That Option, Sir or Madam!&#8221;</p>
<p>Because choices are really bad!</p>

<p>I want you to examine your&nbsp;<a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Map_and_territory"">map</a>. &nbsp;It's the representation you carry around in your head that says, ""I am in control of most things"" or it says, ""most things are out of my control"". &nbsp;Or for very specific things it says, ""I am in control"" or ""I am not in control"".</p>
<p>Factually - In the territory - through life things are more and less in your control or shaped by events beyond your control in the external world.  Independent of your locus of control, can be noted the way you feel about a problem alongside whether it is internal of external locus of control. &nbsp; As a separation of cause and effect. &nbsp;(Of concrete event and their surrounding judgements, evaluations, conclusions or extrapolations)<a href=""http://bearlamp.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/rLocus-of-control4.png""><img class=""alignnone size-large wp-image-833"" src=""http://bearlamp.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/rLocus-of-control4.png"" alt="""" width=""640"" height=""310"" /></a></p>
<hr />
<p>This might already seem obvious but let's make some examples to play with. &nbsp;Here are some times that you might feel in control or out of control.</p>
<ol>
<li>Internal-Good: <em>I am the lead on the project so everything is going to get done my way (the right way).</em></li>
<li>Internal-Bad: <em>My house is a mess and it's my fault. &nbsp;It won't get tidy unless I do something about it and it's bothering me.</em></li>
<li>External-Good: <em>I outsourced my tax to an accountant. &nbsp;Now I have less to worry about.</em></li>
<li>External-Bad:&nbsp;<em>I got the flu, how does this keep happening to me?!?</em></li>
</ol>
<p>In these examples it's clear what's going on (<a href=""http://bearlamp.com.au/concrete-instructions/"">the concrete</a>) and it's supposed to be clear whether it's an internal or external locus of control, and the feeling is mentioned.  Now lets play with them. &nbsp;Can we shift the concrete experiences to a different locus of control? from the original first example we can shift the event to the 4 quadrants above</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Internal-good: <em>I am the lead on the project so everything is going to get done my way (the right way).</em></strong></li>
<li>Internal-bad:&nbsp;<em>I am the lead on the project. &nbsp;It's all on me. What if I make a mistake, it will be all my fault. &nbsp;I don't know if I can handle it.</em></li>
<li>External-good:&nbsp;<em>I am the lead on the project,&nbsp;I have so much responsibility at work, they must know I can handle it. &nbsp;</em></li>
<li>External-bad: <em>I am the lead on the project.&nbsp;I am under so much pressure at work. &nbsp;It's stressing me out!</em></li>
</ol>
<p>But that's not the only example that can shift.</p>
<ol>
<li>Internal-good: <em>My house is a mess, it's my fault but I don't care. &nbsp;I am having way too much fun to bother with it. &nbsp;I will deal with it when it bothers me enough or when I find time</em></li>
<li><strong>Internal-bad: <em>My house is a mess and it's my fault. &nbsp;It won't get tidy unless I do something about it and it's bothering me.</em></strong></li>
<li>External-good:<em> My house is a mess and it's my fault, lucky for me no one cares! &nbsp;I can get away with it because it doesn't matter. &nbsp;</em></li>
<li>External-bad:&nbsp;<em>My house is a mess and it's my fault, what if anyone sees, I can't have friends over, what would they think of me? &nbsp;I have too much to do, life never gives me enough time to hold myself together</em></li>
</ol>
<p>As we try each example...</p>
<ol>
<li>Internal-good: <em>I outsourced my tax to an accountant. &nbsp;I am a powerful agent that can decide to not do tasks if I don't want to. &nbsp;I know my strengths and this is not one of them.</em></li>
<li>Internal-bad:&nbsp;<em>I outsourced my tax to an accountant. &nbsp;</em><em>I am incompetent about finance, it's my fault I have to pay someone to do this for me.</em></li>
<li><strong>External-good: <em>I outsourced my tax to an accountant. &nbsp;Now I have less to worry about.</em></strong></li>
<li>External-bad:&nbsp;<em>I outsourced my tax to an accountant.&nbsp;</em><em>My tax was too hard, I had no choice but to pay someone to fix it for me</em></li>
</ol> <ol>
<li>Internal-good: <em>I got the flu. &nbsp;I had to take care of my sick friends, I knew there was a risk but you gotta live.</em></li>
<li>Internal-Bad:&nbsp;<em>I got the flu. I hate public transport, so many sick people I always get sick. &nbsp;I can't help it.</em></li>
<li>External-good:&nbsp;<em>I got the flu. these things happen. &nbsp;Better take it easy or I will be sick for longer.</em></li>
<li><strong>External-bad:&nbsp;<em>I got the flu, how does this keep happening to me?!?</em></strong></li>
</ol> 
<hr />
<p>Curious isn't it. &nbsp;Any <a href=""http://bearlamp.com.au/concrete-instructions/"">concrete experience</a> can be shifted to a good/bad feeling, and any locus of control can be shifted to a internal/external locus of control as well.  As a person who has an ego that barely fits in the room, it means that I am very practised at living in that first row of the square. &nbsp;That means I am looking for a method that either obtains power/control for myself or bestows responsibility to the external locus of control.  If you carry anxieties around with you, chances are they have some perspective that can be changed by hanging around in the other part of the square. &nbsp;Obviously this is not yet a method for getting you into the first row of the square but moving in that direction is the strategy below.</p>
<h2><strong>How?</strong></h2>
<p>The only method I want to mention in this article is to switch locus of control. &nbsp;So if you are in Internal-bad try switch to external and see what comes up. &nbsp;That is; move diagonally in the table.  Going from;  Internal-bad: <em>My house is a mess and it's my fault. &nbsp;It won't get tidy unless I do something about it and it's bothering me.</em> To:  External-good:<em> My house is a mess and it's my fault, lucky for me no one else cares! &nbsp;I can get away with it because it doesn't matter to anyone else and no one can see.</em> While avoiding:  External-bad:&nbsp;<em>My house is a mess and it's my fault, what if anyone sees, I can't have friends over, what would they think of me? &nbsp;I have too much to do, life never gives me enough time to hold myself together</em> How exactly? Try:</p>
<ol>
<li>Write down the problem in concrete form. &nbsp;Or get clear on what the problem is somehow. &nbsp;You can talk to a friend or just think about it so long as you lock down what the problem is. &nbsp;The benefit of writing it down is that once written it's not going to squirm in your head and be the elusive spiralling colour changing problem monster.</li>
<li>Decide which locus of control you are currently in. (or just pick one. &nbsp;It can't both be ""my fault"" and ""not my problem"" at the same time"" so start somewhere and switch.)</li>
<li>Try think of ways in which the problem is in the other locus of control. &nbsp;(""Not my problem"" or ""I can take charge of this problem"")</li>
<li>If 3 seems impossible - ask other people for help. &nbsp;They will be able to see your situation differently and suggest ways of looking that are in the other locus of control.</li>
</ol>
<p>It would be very hard for a problem to be both <strong>entirely your fault (caused by you)</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>the world hating you</strong>&nbsp;<strong>(caused by external forces)</strong> at the same time. &nbsp;It's also remarkably hard to be <strong>in control</strong> of a problem and have it be <strong>not your problem</strong>. &nbsp;What I am saying is that it would have to either be your problem or not your problem. &nbsp;It would be hard to be both.</p>
<hr />
<p>Meta: changing your internal models of locus of control is an internal locus of control method. &nbsp;Unless you propose, ""this is the way I am I can't change it"" which would be an external locus of control explanation.  I don't know how to build on this so it will have to come in another post. &nbsp;having this out there will help to make it easier to build on later.</p>
<hr />

<p>I generally don't tell people I'm an atheist (I describe my beliefs without using any common labels). Why? I know that if I say the words ""I am an atheist,"" that they will <em>hear </em>the following concepts:</p>
<p>- I positively believe there is no God</p>
<p>- I cannot be persuaded by evidence any more than most believers can be persuaded by evidence, ie, I have a kind of faith in my atheism</p>
<p>- I wish to distance myself from members of religious tribes</p>
<p>As I said, the point has already been made; If I <em>know </em>that they will hear those false ideas when I say a certain phrase, how can I say I am honest in speaking it, knowing that I will cause them to have false beliefs? Hence the saying, if you wish to protect yourself, speak the truth. If you wish to be honest, speak so that truth will be heard.</p>
<p>Many a politician convincingly lies with truths by saying things that they <em>know </em>will be interpreted in a certain positive (and false) way, but which they can always defend as having been intended to convey some other meaning.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>The New</p>
<p>There is a counterpart to this insight, come to me as I've begun to pay more attention to the flow of implicit social communication. If speaking the truth in a way you know will deceive is a lie, then perhaps telling a lie in a way that you know will communicate a true concept is not a lie.</p>
<p>I've relaxed my standards of truth-telling as I've come to understand this. ""You're the best"" and ""You can do this"" statements have been opened to me, no qualifiers needed. If I know that everyone in a group has to say ""I have XYZ qualification,"" but I also know that no one actually believes anybody when they say it, I can comfortably recite those words, knowing that I'm not actually leading anybody to believe false things, and thus, am not being dishonest.</p>
<p>Politicians use this method, too, and I think I'm more or less okay with it. You see, we have a certain problem that arises from intellectual inequality. There are certain truths which literally <em>cannot be spoken </em>to some people. If someone has an IQ of 85, you literally cannot tell them the truth about a great number of things (or they cannot receive it). And there are a great many more people who have the raw potential to understand certain difficult truths, but whom you cannot <em>reasonably </em>tell these truths (they'd have to want to learn, put in effort, receive extensive teaching, etc).</p>
<p>What if some of these truths are pertinent to policy? What do you do, say a bunch of phrases that are ""true"" in a way you will interpret them, but which will only be heard as...</p>
<p>As what? What do people hear when you explain concepts they cannot understand? If I had to guess, very often they interpret this as an attack on their social standing, as an attempt by the speaker to establish themselves as a figure of superior ability, to whom they should defer. You sound uppity, cold, out-of-touch, maybe nerdy or socially inept.</p>
<p>So, then...if you're socially capable, you don't say those things. You give up. You can't speak the truth, you literally cannot make a great many people hear the real reasons why policy Z is a good idea; they have limited the vocabulary of the dialogue by their ability and willingness to engage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your remaining moves are to limit yourself to their vocabulary, or say something outside of that vocabulary, all the nuance of which will evaporate en route to their ears, and which will be heard as a monochromatic ""I think I'm better than you.""</p>
<p>The details of this dynamic at play go on and on, but for now, I'll just say that this is the kind of thing Scott Adams is referring to when he says that what Trump has said is ""emotionally true"" even if it ""doesn't pass the fact checks"" (see dialogue with Sam Harris).</p>
<p>In a world of inequality, you pick your poison. Communicate what truths can be received by your audience, or...be a nerd, and stay out of elections.</p>",Bound_up,bound_up,Bound_up,
TaXd7izDmegoFRmeG,Prediction should be a sport,prediction-should-be-a-sport,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/TaXd7izDmegoFRmeG/prediction-should-be-a-sport,2017-08-10T07:55:44.313Z,22,14,21,False,False,,"<p>So, I've been thinking about prediction markets and why they aren't really catching on as much as I think they should.</p>
<p>My suspicion is that (beside Robin Hanson's signaling explanation, and the amount of work it takes to get to the large numbers of predictors where the quality of results becomes interesting) the basic problem of prediction markets is that they look and feel like gambling. Or at best like the stock market, which for the vast majority of people is no less distasteful.</p>
<p>Only a small minority of people are neither disgusted by nor terrified of gambling. Prediction markets right now are restricted to this small minority.</p>
<p>Poker used to have the same problem.</p>
<p>But over the last few decades Poker players have established that Poker is (also) a sport. They kept repeating that winning isn't purely a matter of luck, they acquired the various trappings of tournaments and leagues, they developed a culture of admiration for the most skillful players that pays in prestige rather than only money and makes it customary for everyone involved to show their names and faces. For Poker, this has worked really well. There are much more Poker players, more really smart people are deciding to get into Poker and I assume the art of game probably improved as well.</p>
<p>So we should consider re-framing prediction the same way.</p>
<p>The calibration game already does this to a degree, but sport needs competition, so results need to be comparable, so everyone needs to make predictions on the same events. You'd need something like standard cards of events that players place their predictions on.</p>
<p>Here's a fantasy of what it could look like.</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Late in the year, a prediction tournament starts with the publication of a list of events in the coming year. Everybody is invited to enter the tournament (and maybe pay a small participation fee) by the end of the year, for a chance to be among the best predictors and win fame and prizes.</li>
<li>Everyone who enters plays the calibration game on the same list of events. All predictions are made public as soon as the submission period is over and the new year begins. Lots of discussion of each event's distribution of predictions.</li>
<li>Over the course of the year, events on the list happen or fail to happen. This allows for continually updated scores, a leaderboard and lots of blogging/journalistic opportunities.</li>
<li>Near the end of the year, as the leaderboard turns into a shortlist of potential winners, tension mounts. Conveniently, this is also when the next tournament starts.</li>
<li>At new year's, the winner is crowned (and I'm open to having that happen literally) at a big celebration which is also the end of the submission period for the next tournament and the revelation of what everyone is predicting for this next round. This is a big event that happens to be on a holiday, where more people have time for big events.</li>
</ul>
<div>Of course this isn't intended to replace existing prediction markets. It is an addition to those, a fun and social thing with lots of PR potential and many opportunities to promote rationality. It should attract people to prediction who are not attracted to prediction markets. And it could be prototyped pretty cheaply, and developed further if it is as much fun as I think it would be.</div>

iLMkKDKmfbMkDuQBm,The Lizard People Of Alpha Draconis 1 Decided To Build An Ansible,the-lizard-people-of-alpha-draconis-1-decided-to-build-an,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/iLMkKDKmfbMkDuQBm/the-lizard-people-of-alpha-draconis-1-decided-to-build-an,2017-08-10T00:33:54.000Z,46,29,1,False,False,,"<p><b>I.</b></p>
<p>The lizard people of Alpha Draconis 1 decided to build an <A HREF=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansible"">ansible</A>.</p>
<p>The transmitter was a colossal tower of silksteel, doorless and windowless. Inside were millions of modular silksteel cubes, each filled with beetles, a different species in every cube. Big beetles, small beetles, red beetles, blue beetles, friendly beetles, venomous beetles. There hadn&#8217;t been a million beetle species on Alpha Draconis I before the ansible. The lizard people had genetically engineered them, carefully, lovingly, making each one just different enough from all the others. Atop each beetle colony was a heat lamp. When the heat lamp was on, the beetles crawled up to the top of the cage, sunning themselves, basking in the glorious glow. When it turned off, they huddled together to warmth, chittering out their anger in little infrasonic groans only they could hear.</p>
<p>The receiver stood on 11845 Nochtli, eighty-five light years from Alpha Draconis, toward the galactic rim. It was also made of beetles, a million beetle colonies of the same million species that made up the transmitter. In each beetle colony was a pheromone dispenser. When it was on, the beetles would multiply until the whole cage was covered in them. When it was off, they would gradually die out until only a few were left.</p>
<p>Atop each beetle cage was a mouse cage, filled with a mix of white and grey mice. The white mice had been genetically engineered to want all levers in the &#8220;up&#8221; position, a desire beyond even food or sex in its intensity. The grey mice had been engineered to want levers in the &#8220;down&#8221; position, with equal ferocity. The lizard people had uplifted both strains to full sapience. In each of a million cages, the grey and white mice would argue whether levers should be up or down &#8211; sometimes through philosophical debate, sometimes through outright wars of extermination.</p>
<p>There was one lever in each mouse cage. It controlled the pheromone dispenser in the beetle cage just below.</p>
<p>This was all the lizard people of Alpha Draconis 1 needed to construct their ansible.</p>
<p>They had mastered every field of science. Physics, mathematics, astronomy, cosmology. It had been for nothing. There was no way to communicate faster-than-light. Tachyons didn&#8217;t exist. Hyperspace didn&#8217;t exist. Wormholes didn&#8217;t exist. The light speed barrier was absolute &#8211; <i>if</i> you limited yourself to physics, mathematics, astronomy, and cosmology.</p>
<p>The lizard people of Alpha Draconis I weren&#8217;t going to use any of those things. They were going to build their ansible out of negative average preference utilitarianism.</p>
<p><b>II.</b></p>
<p>Utilitarianism is a moral theory claiming that an action is moral if it makes the world a better place. But what do we mean by &#8220;a better place&#8221;?</p>
<p>Suppose you decide (as Jeremy Bentham did) that it means increasing the total amount of happiness in the universe as much as possible &#8211; the greatest good for the greatest number. Then you run into a so-called &#8220;repugnant conclusion&#8221;. The philosophers quantify happiness into &#8220;utils&#8221;, some arbitrary small unit of happiness. Suppose your current happiness level is 100 utils. And suppose you could sacrifice one util of happiness to create another person whose total happiness is two utils: they are only 1/50th as happy as you are. This person seems quite unhappy by our standards. But crucially, their total happiness is positive; they would (weakly) prefer living to dying. Maybe we can imagine this as a very poor person in a war-torn Third World country who is (for now) not actively suicidal.</p>
<p>It would seem morally correct to make this sacrifice. After all, you are losing one unit of happiness to create two units, increasing the total happiness in the universe. In fact, it would seem morally correct to keep making the sacrifice as many times as you get the opportunity. The end result is that you end up with a happiness of 1 util &#8211; barely above suicidality &#8211; and also there are 99 extra barely-not-suicidal people in war-torn Third World countries.</p>
<p>And the same moral principles that lead you to make the sacrifice bind everyone else alike. So the end result is everyone in the world ends up with the lowest possible positive amount of happiness, plus there are billions of extra near-suicidal people in war-torn Third World countries.</p>
<p>This seems abstract, but in some sense it might be the choice on offer if we have to decide whether to control population growth (thus preserving enough resources to give everyone a good standard of living), or continue explosive growth so that there are many more people but not enough resources for any of them to live comfortably.</p>
<p>The so-called &#8220;repugnant conclusion&#8221; led many philosophers away from &#8220;total utilitarianism&#8221; to &#8220;average utilitarianism&#8221;. Here the goal is still to make the world a better place, but it gets operationalized as &#8220;increase the average happiness level per person&#8221;. The repugnant conclusion clearly fails at this, so we avoid that particular trap.</p>
<p>But here we fall into another ambush: wouldn&#8217;t it be morally correct to kill unhappy people? This raises average happiness very effectively!</p>
<p>So we make another amendment. We&#8217;re not in the business of raising happiness, per se. We&#8217;re in the business of satisfying preferences. People strongly prefer not to die, so you can&#8217;t just kill them. Killing them actively <i>lowers</i> the average number of satisfied preferences.</p>
<p>Philosopher Roger Chao combines these and other refinements of the utilitarian method into a moral theory he calls <A HREF=""http://www.philosophyoflife.org/jpl201204.pdf"">negative average preference utilitarianism</A>, which he considers the first system of ethics to avoid all the various traps and pitfalls. It says: an act is good if it decreases the average number of frustrated preferences per person.</p>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t imply we should create miserable people ad nauseum until the whole world is a Third World slum. It doesn&#8217;t imply that we should kill everyone who cracks a frown. It doesn&#8217;t imply we should murder people for their organs, or never have children again, or replace everybody with identical copies of themselves, or anything like that.</p>
<p>It just implies faster-than-light transmission of moral information.</p>
<p><b>III.</b></p>
<p>The ansible worked like this:</p>
<p>Each colony of beetles represented a bit of information. In the transmitter on Alpha Draconis I, the sender would turn the various colonies&#8217; heat lamps on or off, increasing or decreasing the average utility of the beetles.</p>
<p>In the receiver on 11845 Nochtli, the beetles would be in a constant state of half-light: warmer than the Draconis beetles if their heat lamp was turned off, but colder than them if their heat lamp was turned on. So increasing the population of a certain beetle species on 11845 Nochtli would be morally good if the heat lamp for that species on Alpha Draconis were off, but morally evil otherwise.</p>
<p>The philosophers among the lizard people of Alpha Draconis 1 had realized that this was true regardless of intervening distance; morality was the only force that transcended the speed of light. The question was how to detect it. Yes, a change in the heat lamps on their homeworld would instantly change the moral valence of pulling a lever on a colony 85 light-years away, but how to detect the morality of an action?</p>
<p>The answer was: the arc of the moral universe is long, <i>but it bends toward justice</i>. Over time, as the great debates of history ebb and sway, evil may not be conquered completely, but it will lessen. Our own generation isn&#8217;t perfect, but we have left behind much of the slavery, bigotry, war and torture, of the past; perhaps our descendants will be wiser still. And <A HREF=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/10/27/contra-huemer-on-morals/"">how could this be</A>, if not for some benevolent general rule, some principle that tomorrow must be brighter than today, and the march of moral progress slow but inevitable?</p>
<p>Thus the white and grey rats. They would debate, they would argue, they would even fight &#8211; but in the end, moral progress would have its way. If raising the lever and causing an increase in the beetle population was the right thing to do, then the white rats would eventually triumph; if lowering the lever and causing the beetle population to fall was right, then the victory would eventually go to the grey. All of this would be recorded by a camera watching the mouse colony, and &#8211; lo &#8211; a bit of information would have been transmitted.</p>
<p>The ansible of the lizard people of Alpha Draconis 1 was a flop.</p>
<p>They spent a century working on it: ninety years on near-light-speed starships just transporting the materials, and a decade constructing the receiver according to meticulous plans. With great fanfare, the Lizard Emperor himself sent the first message from Alpha Draconis I. And it was a total flop.</p>
<p>The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends to justice. But nobody had ever thought to ask <i>how</i> long, and why. When everyone alike ought to love the good, why does it take so many years of debate and strife for virtue to triumph over wickedness? Why do war and slavery and torture persist for century after century, so that only endless grinding of the wheels of progress can do them any damage at all?</p>
<p>After eighty-five years of civilizational debate, the grey and white mice in each cage finally overcame their differences and agreed on the right position to put the lever, just as the mundane lightspeed version of the message from Alpha Draconis reached 11845 Nochtli&#8217;s radio telescopes. And the lizard people of Alpha Draconis 1 realized that one can be more precise than simply defining the arc of moral progress as &#8220;long&#8221;. It&#8217;s <i>exactly as long as it needs to be to prevent faster-than-light transmission of moral information</i>. </p>

A key idea: ""Lasch is an external commentary using this rough model. At some point, the combined apparatus of American culture (the state, capital, media, political agitation) tried to make things &ldquo;better&rdquo;. To better its citizens required new social controls (paternalism). The taylorism employed makes things more focused on image, and this results in a more warlike society. Happened with &ldquo;authenticity&rdquo; last time and also [everything below]. To deal with this invasion, society turns to narcissistic defenses. Narcissism is self-centered, but it&rsquo;s an expression of dependence on others, and specifically on the others&rsquo; validation of the narcissist&rsquo;s image.""</p>

</style></head><body><p>Cooperative inverse reinforcement learning (CIRL) generated a lot of
attention last year, as it seemed to do a good job aligning an agent's incentives with
its human supervisor's.
Notably, it led to an elegant solution to the shutdown problem.</p>
<p>The implications for the wireheading problem were less clear.
Some argued that since the agent only used its observations as
evidence about the reward (rather than optimising the observations
directly as in RL), CIRL should avoid the wireheading problem.</p>
<p>In this post I want to show that CIRL does not avoid the wireheading
problem.</p>
<h2>RL Wireheading</h2>
<p>Let's first consider what wireheading in RL looks like from an ""MDP perspective"".</p>
<p>MDP wireheading:
An agent wireheads if it's in a state where the <em>observed reward</em>
(the reward reported by its sensors) is different from the <em>true reward</em>
(the reward assigned to the state by a human supervisor).</p>
<p>For example, consider a highly intelligent RL agent that hijacks its reward channel
and feeds itself full reward.
In the ""MDP perspective"", this means that the agent finds a way to a state where there is high observed reward,
but low true reward (since the supervisor would prefer the agent doing something else).</p>
<h2>IRL Wireheading</h2>
<p>If we accept that RL agents can subvert their sensory data, then we should
also accept that CIRL agents can subvert theirs.
In both cases, this just means that the agents can find their way to states
where the observation doesn't match the truth.
This can lead to the existence of wireheaded states for CIRL agents.</p>
<h3>Concrete Example</h3>

The agent assumes that states are non-corrupt unless there is
evidence to the contrary,
and tries to infer the supervisor's preferences from his actions.</p>

This is analogous to an RL agent finding a corrupt, high reward state, and preferring to take actions to stay there.</p>
<h2>Some Observations</h2>

means that no information about the relative reward between <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""s_1""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">s</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mn"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">1</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>

Letting the agent trust a reward estimate of a state only
after it has multiple sources of evidence about it may help somewhat.
However, a similar example can still be constructed by replacing
<span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""s_2""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">s</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mn"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">2</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> with a cluster of mutually consistent states.</p>

<p>Last week we went to see a classroom for our son.</p>
<p>The school in question had quite a good reputation. This was a place people wanted their kids to go, and when we had been there previously to see a different type of classroom, we understood why, or thought we did. It was doing the thing it was doing and hitting all the bases.</p>
<p>We had just been to a place with a less good reputation, and seen a run-down, not-well-equipped, kids-not-under-control version of this classroom, and were hoping that this version would be better.</p>
<p>We walked in and it looked nice. It had the things such places have. There were things to play with and kids were scattered around playing quietly. Our son walked towards one of the things. One of the kids already there said hi to him. We and the school&#8217;s people watched. I surveyed the room.</p>
<p>Everything looked like it was supposed to look. This was a nice classroom. Kids were playing.</p>
<p>Something was wrong.</p>
<p><span id=""more-9077""></span></p>
<p>I told myself it was nothing. We kept watching. We hoped our son would make a good impression. This was a place people wanted their kids to go. We wanted him to be allowed to go here.</p>
<p>Our son did not want to play much with the other children. We knew this was bad. They would not like it. They would think it meant something was wrong; that he was not ready. He was <em>supposed </em>to want to play with them. We were told he <em>needed </em>to play with them. We felt like we were failing somehow. We hoped he would reconsider.</p>
<p>One of the two school employees that went in with us tested our son, seeing if he knew his numbers and his colors and his shapes. He did ace the numbers and colors and shapes. That felt good. Why was the test even there? I wondered why the older kids needed to be learning single digit numbers.</p>
<p>The employee finished the quizzing and started furiously writing things in boxes on a piece of paper. I hoped they were good, positive things.</p>
<p>I looked around the room more. There were things in corners, things in boxes. The things were trying too hard, somehow. You could smell the educational plan, the committee meeting, the boxes being checked off in a distant room.</p>
<p>There was a sign that said &#8220;Manipulative Phrases.&#8221; It was about how to get conversations started by asking how things work. Not what I think of when I see &#8216;manipulative phrases.&#8217; Refreshing!</p>
<p>Also not how any human voluntarily interacts with any other. It was off. Alien.</p>
<p>Something was wrong.</p>
<p>I looked around at all the things in boxes. Lots of things to do. Nice things.</p>
<p>I recognized a lot of the other things from other classrooms. Must be common core. All hail common core. Common core killed outside play. Common core killed nap time.</p>
<p>I saw the wheel with what the weather is today. I saw the sign with the day of the week it is, was yesterday, and will be tomorrow. Same everywhere. A checkmark in a distant room.</p>
<p>Something was wrong.</p>
<p>I told myself it was nothing.</p>
<p>There was something called &#8216;the cleanup song&#8217; queued up on YouTube. There were four minutes left to play, the children were told. They did not react. Then there were two. Again they were told. Again they did not react. Then there were none. I assume a button was pressed. The song played. The children put their things away, silently, expressionless. A young boy gathered up pattered tiles off the floor and stacked them in his hands. The teachers must be happy.</p>
<p>Something was <em>wrong.</em> These kids are four and five. Kids this age aren&#8217;t like that.</p>
<p>But wasn&#8217;t that the goal? To get kids to understand. To help them cooperate, to be ready for school. Hence the name, preschool. Wasn&#8217;t it nice that they had order and all the kids were well-behaved?</p>
<p>It was nothing. A powerful mantra. It was a good thing.</p>
<p>It was circle time. The kids gathered in a circle.</p>
<p>Our son did not join the circle. We tried to get our son to join the circle.</p>
<p>He did not want to join the circle.</p>
<p>We kept trying. He kept not wanting to.</p>
<p>He wasn&#8217;t wrong. The circle was lame. Super lame.</p>
<p>All the other kids were smiling. They liked the circle. Why did they like the circle? Where did they get this level of buy in?</p>
<p>A full four adults, myself included, were trying to get my son to join this circle. He was failing the test. We were failing the test. He needed to join! Or else! Things! His future! The alpha quadrant!</p>
<p>I heard myself talking. I said &#8220;Join the circle. Don&#8217;t you want to bow to social pressure?&#8221;</p>
<p>Out loud. I said that out loud. The other adults did not react. They somehow seemed amused. No funny looks. The other kids didn&#8217;t notice. They weren&#8217;t listening. No curiosity. There were lots of strange people there and they didn&#8217;t notice. In order to sit in a circle.</p>
<p>I kept going. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you want to conform? Everyone wants you to join the circle.&#8221; I had one or two more. It felt right. It fit. I was sure, somehow.</p>
<p>How was I so sure? I didn&#8217;t know. I decided I must have picked up on something I hadn&#8217;t consciously processed. We went outside, they talked a bit among themselves, then talked to us.  They said they&#8217;d think about whether they had a place for him that met his needs.</p>
<p>We asked a bunch of questions. The answer to all of them was &#8220;it varies.&#8221;</p>
<p>We left and started walking back towards the subway. We would discuss our findings. What did I think?</p>
<p>What did I think? <strong>Something is wrong. </strong></p>
<p>I wanted to shout it from the rooftops. But <em>did I have the right to say that? </em>Isn&#8217;t this place <em>doing everything it is supposed to? </em>What could I actually point to? Who was I to say, <em>no, run screaming for your life? </em></p>
<p>This was what everyone official said was appropriate. This was what we were supposed to want. If we didn&#8217;t do it we would be hurting our son. We would be irresponsible. It would be <em>just awful. </em><em>We </em>would be just awful. We&#8217;d certainly be to blame for what happened. There would be no end to the trouble. The city would try to punish us, deny us other things we needed; not everything they wanted for us was bad. If we just said yes we could be done with it. This is what people do. It must be all right, right?</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t know what I was going to say.</p>
<p>My wife asked what I thought of the place.</p>
<p>I said &#8220;This is what a school is, right? This is what the thing is?&#8221;</p>
<p>I looked at her face. Something was wrong. The answer scared her. She wanted to disagree. Maybe she didn&#8217;t know how. Maybe she didn&#8217;t think she had a right to. Maybe she wanted to let me finish first so she wouldn&#8217;t anchor me. Hard to tell.</p>
<p>I said &#8220;It felt like&#8230; this is where children&#8217;s souls go to die.&#8221;</p>
<p>She said &#8220;yeah, it felt that way to me too.&#8221; The relief in her voice was palpable.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t just me.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was like the Stepford Wives in there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, I know what you mean.&#8221;</p>
<p>The light had gone out in those kids. They weren&#8217;t being creative or curious. They were following a routine, a series of prompts and triggers. They were inmates, worn down into submission.</p>
<p>They were four and five!</p>
<p>I had social confirmation now. I had permission. &#8220;We are not sending our son to prison.&#8221;</p>
<p>My wife wasn&#8217;t willing to endorse that metaphor, but shared the sentiment. We were in agreement. We would find another way.</p>
<p>It hit me what had almost happened. What we had almost done. To our son. To save some money on services, to bow to social pressure from an authority we knew did not even have our best interests at heart or much of a clue.</p>
<p>How many other parents knew but did not feel they had the right? Knew in their gut what was about to happen, but did not know how to say no, or could not afford to? Were too worn down by life, by work, by the bureaucracy, without the time or money to stop what inertia wanted? How many kids&#8217; souls have to die, slowly, one day at a time?</p>
<p>Something is wrong. Really, really wrong.</p>
<p>Something bigger.</p>

He thinks we can and should be less opaque, more comprehensible, and less <a href=""https://meaningness.com/metablog/rationalism-critiques"">inscrutable</a> (specifically less inscrutable to rationalism and <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/lw/pad/ignorant_irrelevant_and_inscrutable_rationalism/#comments"">rationalists</a>).</p><p><strong><a href=""https://meaningness.com/metablog/rationalism-critiques"">Ignorant, irrelevant, and inscrutable</a></strong><br><a href=""https://meaningness.com/metablog/rationalism-critiques""><em>I have changed my mind. It should go without saying that rationality is better than irrationality. But now I realize&#x2026;</em>meaningness.com</a></p><p>I&#x2019;ve thought about this issue a lot. My <a href=""http://gworley3.github.io/"">previous blogging project</a> hit a dead end when I reached the point of needing to explain <a href=""https://medium.com/@gworley3/holonic-integration-927ba21d774b"">holonic thinking</a>. Around this time I contracted obscurantism and spent several months only sharing my philosophical writing with a few people on Facebook in barely decipherable stream-of-consciousness posts. But during this time I also worked on developing a pedagogy, manifested in a self-help book, that would allow people to follow in my footsteps even if I couldn&#x2019;t explain my ideas. That project produced three things: an unpublished book draft, <a href=""https://mapandterritory.org/act-into-fear-and-abandon-all-hope-81bcc114c5fd"">one mantra of advice</a>, and <a href=""https://mapandterritory.org/the-personal-growth-cycle-34ec1c218615"">a realization that the way can only be walked, not followed</a>. So when I <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/o0u/map_and_territory_a_new_rationalist_group_blog/"">returned to blogging</a> here on Medium my goal was not to be deliberately obscure, but also not to be reliably understood. I had come to terms with the idea that my thoughts might never be fully explicable, but I could at least still write for those <a href=""http://thedailyenlightenment.com/2011/07/was-the-buddha-reluctant-to-teach/"">without too much dust in their eyes</a>.</p><span><figure><img src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*OpZiFG3bC37zP5Z2qopRmQ.jpeg"" class=""draft-image "" style=""width:40%""></figure></span><p>The trouble is that holonic thought is <a href=""https://mapandterritory.org/phenomenological-complexity-classes-8b41836437b9"">necessarily inscrutable without the use of holons</a>, and history shows this makes it very difficult to teach or explain holonic thinking to others. For example, the first wave of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmodernism"">post-modernists</a> like Foucault, Derrida, and Lyotard applied Heidegger&#x2019;s <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/phenomenology/"">phenomenological epistemology</a> to develop complex, multi-faceted understandings of history, literature, and academic culture. Unfortunately they did this in an environment of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_modernism"">high modernism</a> where <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationalism#Classical_rationalism"">classical rationalism</a> was taken for granted, so they failed to notice they were building off the <a href=""https://meaningness.com/systematic-mode"">strengths of modernism</a> even as they <a href=""https://meaningness.com/systems-crisis-breakdown"">derided its weaknesses</a>. Consequently they focused so much on teaching the subjectivity of experience that they forgot to impress that it was <a href=""http://www.phenomenologyonline.com/inquiry/orientations-in-phenomenology/existential-phenomenology/"">subjective experience of an external reality</a> and left their students with an intellectual tradition <a href=""https://areomagazine.com/2017/03/27/how-french-intellectuals-ruined-the-west-postmodernism-and-its-impact-explained/"">now widely regarded as useless</a> for anything other than <a href=""http://www.overcomingbias.com/2015/05/what-is-signaling.html"">status signaling</a>.</p><p>In comparison Buddhist traditions have, to the extent that <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodhi"">bodhi</a> is synonymous with meta-rationality and holonic thinking, done a better job of teaching post-modernism than the post-modernists did. <a href=""http://lukemuehlhauser.com/ancient-indian-philosophy-a-painless-introduction/"">Indic philosophical traditions</a> hit upon post-modern ideas at least as early as the Axial Age and they <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nagarjuna/"">became central to Buddhist philosophy around 200 CE</a>. I&#x2019;d argue the sutras of Buddhism <a href=""https://vividness.live/2011/06/16/the-making-of-buddhist-modernism/"">do no better</a> than the texts of the post-modernists at teaching holon-level thinking, but over the centuries Buddhist schools also developed <a href=""http://arobuddhism.org/community/an-uncommon-perspective.html"">tantric instruction</a> that <a href=""https://vividness.live/2017/02/03/tantra-techniques/"">created environments</a> in which practitioners were able <a href=""https://mapandterritory.org/the-developmental-role-of-play-443549cfed3b"">to play and later work</a> with holons. It appears to me these &#x201C;esoteric&#x201D; techniques tapped in to the same <a href=""https://mapandterritory.org/unstaging-developmental-psychology-fcdc5f9ba894"">developmental psychology</a> operating in <a href=""https://mapandterritory.org/the-personal-growth-cycle-34ec1c218615"">personal growth</a> and in doing so <a href=""https://approachingaro.org/"">created lineages</a> that <a href=""http://www.tamqui.com/buddhaworld/Thien/Chan/Zen"">provide paths</a> to holon-level thinking that people traverse to this day.</p><p>I suspect the key differentiator of the experiential learning of personal growth and tantra from the textual learning of academia and sutra is the focus on <a href=""http://www.ecosophia.net/blogs-and-essays/the-well-of-galabes/gnosis-doxa-and-episteme-or-what-kind-of-knowledge-do-you-mean/"">gnosis over episteme</a>, and this suggests why the meta-rational is inscrutable from rationalism, but I&#x2019;ll do one better and prove it. To do that it will suffice to show that there exists at least one meta-rational idea that cannot be made scrutable to rationalism. I choose meta-rational epistemology.</p><p>Rational/modern/system-relationship epistemology aims to be consistent and complete, meaning it produces a complete ontology. To the extent that there is any disagreement over system-relationship epistemology it is disagreement over how to compute correct ontology. Meta-rational/post-modern/holonic epistemology denies the possibility of a complete ontology via consistent epistemology because <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20170620050423/http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.com/2017/02/the-world-as-will.html"">epistemology necessarily influences ontology</a>. That is to say, even if some epistemology is consistent, it <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/goedel-incompleteness/"">cannot be complete because it cannot prove its own consistency</a>, thus no consistent epistemology can produce complete ontology. Instead we might have a complete but inconsistent meta-epistemology that chooses between consistent epistemologies in different situations based on telos, like a desire for <a href=""http://yudkowsky.net/rational/the-simple-truth/"">correspondence to reality</a> or <a href=""https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2016/06/02/the-theory-of-narrative-selection/"">telling an interesting story</a>, but telos asks us to make an axiological evaluation, not an epistemic one, and thus we are <a href=""https://meaningness.com/metablog/bongard-meta-rationality"">forced to admit</a> that even our consistent and complete meta-epistemology needs a free variable, hence cannot actually be complete.</p><p>In this way holonic epistemology is necessarily inscrutable to system-relationship epistemology because it explicitly demands the latter do something it explicitly cannot. To be fair, system-relationship epistemology does the same thing to pre-rational/traditional/system epistemology by demanding consistency that the latter cannot tolerate because <a href=""https://meaningness.com/choiceless-mode"">it would violate its internal completeness</a>, but I think this is infrequently acknowledged because if you <a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/02/23/in-favor-of-niceness-community-and-civilization/"">grew up</a> <a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/04/22/right-is-the-new-left/"">in the shadow</a> <a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/08/14/beware-isolated-demands-for-rigor/"">of the modern world</a> <a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/06/14/living-by-the-sword/"">you probably</a> <a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/06/13/arguments-from-my-opponent-believes-something/"">didn&#x2019;t notice</a> when <a href=""https://meaningness.com/meaningness-history"">modernity demanded this of you</a>. And unless you learned to <a href=""http://garybasin.com/talking-past-each-other/"">ignore the problem</a>, the modern world constantly gives you <a href=""http://malcolmocean.com/2017/07/being-grateful-for-the-opportunity-to-train/"">opportunities</a> to experience the system-relationship level of complexity and obtain gnosis of it. But obtaining gnosis of the post-modern and holonic seems to require that a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_during_World_War_II"">great tragedy</a> befall you or that you have enough dedication to <a href=""https://mapandterritory.org/act-into-fear-and-abandon-all-hope-81bcc114c5fd"">tolerate the pain of finding it</a>, so beyond better building the episteme of holons for those few with more than doxa of them, I&#x2019;m doubtful being less inscrutable will accomplish much of what Chapman seems to <a href=""https://meaningness.com/metablog/stem-fluidity-bridge"">hope it will</a>.</p>",gworley,gordon-seidoh-worley,Gordon Seidoh Worley,

<p><IMG SRC=""http://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/einsteinline1.jpg""></p>
<p>&#8230;when in fact it will probably look like this:</p>
<p><IMG SRC=""http://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/einsteinline2.jpg""></p>
<p>That is, we naturally think there&#8217;s a pretty big intellectual difference between mice and chimps, and a pretty big intellectual difference between normal people and Einstein, and implicitly treat these as about equal in degree. But in any objective terms we choose &#8211; amount of evolutionary work it took to generate the difference, number of neurons, measurable difference in brain structure, performance on various tasks, etc &#8211; the gap between mice and chimps is immense, and the difference between an average Joe and Einstein trivial in comparison. So we should be wary of timelines where AI reaches mouse level in 2020, chimp level in 2030, Joe-level in 2040, and Einstein level in 2050. If AI reaches the mouse level in 2020 and chimp level in 2030, for all we know it could reach Joe level on January 1st, 2040 and Einstein level on January 2nd of the same year. This would be pretty disorienting and (if the AI is poorly aligned) dangerous.</p>
<p>I found this argument really convincing when I first heard it, and I thought the data backed it up. For example, in my <A HREF=""http://slatestarcodex.com/superintelligence-faq/"">Superintelligence FAQ</A>, I wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>In 1997, the best computer Go program in the world, Handtalk, won NT$250,000 for performing a previously impossible feat – beating an 11 year old child (with an 11-stone handicap penalizing the child and favoring the computer!) As late as September 2015, no computer had ever beaten any professional Go player in a fair game. Then in March 2016, a Go program beat 18-time world champion Lee Sedol 4-1 in a five game match. Go programs had gone from “dumber than heavily-handicapped children” to “smarter than any human in the world” in twenty years, and “from never won a professional game” to “overwhelming world champion” in six months.</p></blockquote>
<p>But Katja Grace <A HREF=""http://aiimpacts.org/is-the-range-of-human-intelligence-small/"">takes a broader perspective</A> and finds the opposite. For example, she finds that chess programs improved gradually from &#8220;beating the worst human players&#8221; to &#8220;beating the best human players&#8221; over fifty years or so, ie the entire amount of time computers have existed:</p>
<p><center><IMG SRC=""http://aiimpacts.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/chess_progress.gif""></center></p>
<p>AlphaGo represented a pretty big leap in Go ability, but before that, Go engines improved pretty gradually too (see the original AI Impacts post for discussion of the Go ranking system on the vertical axis):</p>
<p><center><IMG SRC=""http://aiimpacts.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/gobothistory-copy-1024x743.jpg""></center></p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot more on Katja&#8217;s page, overall very convincing. In field after field, computers have taken decades to go from the mediocre-human level to the genius-human level. So how can one reconcile the common-sense force of Eliezer&#8217;s argument with the empirical force of Katja&#8217;s contrary data?</p>
<p><b>Theory 1: Mutational Load</b></p>
<p>Katja has her own theory:</p>
<blockquote><p>The brains of humans are nearly identical, by comparison to the brains of other animals or to other possible brains that could exist. This might suggest that the engineering effort required to move across the human range of intelligences is quite small, compared to the engineering effort required to move from very sub-human to human-level intelligence&#8230;However, we should not be surprised to find meaningful variation in the cognitive performance regardless of the difficulty of improving the human brain. This makes it difficult to infer much from the observed variations. </p>
<p>Why should we not be surprised? De novo deleterious mutations are introduced into the genome with each generation, and the prevalence of such mutations is determined by the balance of mutation rates and negative selection. If de novo mutations significantly impact cognitive performance, then there must necessarily be significant selection for higher intelligence–and hence behaviorally relevant differences in intelligence. This balance is determined entirely by the mutation rate, the strength of selection for intelligence, and the negative impact of the average mutation.</p>
<p>You can often make a machine worse by breaking a random piece, but this does not mean that the machine was easy to design or that you can make the machine better by adding a random piece. Similarly, levels of variation of cognitive performance in humans may tell us very little about the difficulty of making a human-level intelligence smarter.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m usually a fan of using mutational load to explain stuff. But here I worry there&#8217;s too much left unexplained. Sure, the explanation for variation in human intelligence is whatever it is. And there&#8217;s however much mutational load there is. But that doesn&#8217;t address the fundamental disparity: isn&#8217;t the difference between a mouse and Joe Average still immeasurably greater than the difference between Joe Average and Einstein?</p>
<p><b>Theory 2: Purpose-Built Hardware</b></p>
<p>Mice can&#8217;t play chess (citation needed). So talking about &#8220;playing chess at the mouse level&#8221; might require more philosophical groundwork than we&#8217;ve been giving it so far.</p>
<p>Might the worst human chess players play chess pretty close to as badly as is even possible? I&#8217;ve certainly seen people who don&#8217;t even seem to be looking one move ahead very well, which is sort of like an upper bound for chess badness. Even though the human brain is the most complex object in the known universe, noble in reason, infinite in faculties, like an angel in apprehension, etc, etc, it seems like maybe not 100% of that capacity is being used in a guy who gets fools-mated on his second move.</p>
<p>We can compare to human prowess at mental arithmetic. We know that, below the hood, the brain is solving really complicated differential equations in milliseconds every time it catches a ball. <i>Above</i> the hood, most people can&#8217;t multiply two two-digit numbers in their head. Likewise, in principle the brain <A HREF=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-is-the-memory-capacity/"">has 2.5 petabytes</A> worth of memory storage; in practice I can&#8217;t always remember my sixteen-digit credit card number.</p>
<p>Imagine a kid who has an amazing $5000 gaming computer, but her parents have locked it so she can only play Minecraft. She needs a calculator for her homework, but she can&#8217;t access the one on her computer, so she <A HREF=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgJfVRhotlQ"">builds one out of Minecraft blocks</A>. The gaming computer can have as many gigahertz as you want; she&#8217;s still only going to be able to do calculations at a couple of measly operations per second. Maybe our brains are so purpose-built for swinging through trees or whatever that it takes an equivalent amount of emulation to get them to play chess competently.</p>
<p>In that case, mice just wouldn&#8217;t have the emulated more-general-purpose computer. People who are bad at chess would be able to emulate a chess-playing computer very laboriously and inefficiently. And people who are good at chess would be able to bring some significant fraction of their full most-complex-object-in-the-known-universe powers to bear. There are some anecdotal reports from chessmasters that suggest something like this &#8211; descriptions of just &#8220;seeing&#8221; patterns on the chessboard as complex objects, in the same way that the dots on a pointillist painting naturally resolve into a tree or a French lady or whatever.</p>
<p>This would also make sense in the context of calculation prodigies &#8211; those kids who can multiply ten digit numbers in their heads really easily. Everybody has to have the capacity to do this. But some people are better at accessing that capacity than others.</p>
<p>But it doesn&#8217;t make sense in the context of self-driving cars! If there was ever a task that used our purpose-built, no-emulation-needed native architecture, it would be driving: recognizing objects in a field and coordinating movements to and away from them. But my impression of self-driving car progress is that it&#8217;s been stalled for a while at a level better than the worst human drivers, but worse than the best human drivers. It&#8217;ll have preventable accidents every so often &#8211; not as many as a drunk person or an untrained kid would, but more than we would expect of a competent adult. This suggests a really wide range of human ability even in native-architecture-suited tasks.</p>
<p><b>Theory 3: Widely Varying Sub-Abilities</b></p>
<p>I think self-driving cars are already much better than humans at certain tasks &#8211; estimating differences, having split-second reflexes, not getting lost. But they&#8217;re also much worse than humans at others &#8211; I think adapting to weird conditions, like ice on the road or animals running out onto the street. So maybe it&#8217;s not that computers spend much time in a general &#8220;human-level range&#8221;, so much as being superhuman on some tasks, and subhuman on other tasks, and generally averaging out to somewhere inside natural human variation.</p>
<p>In the same way, long after Deep Blue beat Kasparov there were parts of chess that humans could do better than computers, &#8220;anti-computer&#8221; strategies that humans could play to maximize their advantage, and <A HREF=""http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20151201-the-cyborg-chess-players-that-cant-be-beaten"">human + computer &#8220;cyborg&#8221; teams</A> that could do better than either kind of player alone.</p>
<p>This sort of thing is no doubt true. But I still find it surprising that the average of &#8220;way superhuman on some things&#8221; and &#8220;way subhuman on other things&#8221; averages within the range of human variability so often. This seems as surprising as ever.</p>
<p><b>Theory 1.1: Humans Are Light-Years Beyond Every Other Animal, So Even A Tiny Range Of Human Variation Is Relatively Large</b></p>
<p>Or maybe the first graph representing the naive perspective is right, Eliezer&#8217;s graph representing a more reasonable perspective is wrong, and the range of human variability is immense. Maybe the difference between Einstein and Joe Average is the same (or bigger than!) the difference between Joe Average and a mouse.</p>
<p>That is, imagine a Zoological IQ in which mice score 10, chimps score 20, and Einstein scores 200. Now we can apply Katja&#8217;s insight: that humans can have very wide variation in their abilities thanks to mutational load. But because Einstein is so far beyond lower animals, there&#8217;s a wide range for humans to be worse than Einstein in which they&#8217;re still better than chimps. Maybe Joe Average scores 100, and the village idiot scores 50. This preserves our intuition that even the village idiot is vastly smarter than a chimp, let alone a mouse. But it also means that most of computational progress will occur within the human range. If it takes you five years from starting your project, to being as smart as a chimp, then even granting linear progress it could still take you fifty more before you&#8217;re smarter than Einstein.</p>
<p>This seems to explain all the data very well. It&#8217;s just shocking that humans are so far beyond any other animal, and their internal variation so important. </p>
<p>Maybe the closest real thing we have to zoological IQ is <A HREF=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalization_quotient"">encephalization quotient</A>, a measure that relates brain size to body size in various complicated ways that sometimes predict how smart the animal is. We find that mice have an EQ of 0.5, chimps of 2.5, and humans of 7.5.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know whether to think about this in relative terms (chimps are a factor of five smarter than mice, but humans only a factor of three greater than chimps, so the mouse-chimp difference is bigger than the chimp-human difference) or in absolute terms (chimps are 2 units bigger than mice, but humans are five units bigger than chimps, so the chimp-human difference is bigger than the mouse-chimp difference).</p>
<p>Brain size variation within humans is <A HREF=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_size"">surprisingly large</A>. Just within a sample of 46 adult European-American men, it <A HREF=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajpa.10092/abstract"">ranged from</A> 1050 to 1500 cm^3m; there are further differences by race and gender. The difference from the largest to smallest brain is about the same as the difference between the smallest brain and a chimp (275 &#8211; 500 cm^3); since chimps weight a bit less than humans, we should probably give them some bonus points. Overall, using brain size as some kind of very weak Fermi calculation proxy measure for intelligence (see <A HREF=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_size#Intelligence"">here</A>), it looks like maybe the difference between Einstein and the village idiot equals the difference between the idiot and the chimp?</p>
<p>But most mutations that decrease brain function will do so in ways other than decreasing brain size; they will just make brains less efficient per unit mass. So probably looking at variation in brain size underestimates the amount of variation in intelligence. Is it underestimating it enough that the Einstein &#8211; Joe difference ends up equivalent to the Joe &#8211; mouse difference? I don&#8217;t know. But so far I don&#8217;t have anything to say it isn&#8217;t, except a feeling along the lines of &#8220;that can&#8217;t possibly be true, can it?&#8221;</p>
<p>But why not? Look at all the animals in the world, and the majority of the variation in size is within the group &#8220;whales&#8221;. The absolute size difference between a bacterium and an elephant is less than the size difference between <i>Balaenoptera musculus brevicauda</i> and <i>Balaenoptera musculus musculus</i> &#8211; ie the Indian Ocean Blue Whale and the Atlantic Ocean Blue Whale. Once evolution finds a niche where greater size is possible and desirable, and figures out how to make animals scalable, it can go from the horse-like ancestor of whales to actual whales in a couple million years. Maybe what whales are to size, humans are to brainpower.</p>
<p>Stephen Hsu calculates that a certain kind of genetic engineering, carried to its logical conclusion, could create humans <A HREF=""http://nautil.us/issue/18/genius/super_intelligent-humans-are-coming"">&#8220;a hundred standard deviations above average&#8221;</A> in intelligence, ie IQ 1000 or so. This sounds absurd on the face of it, like a nutritional supplement so good at helping you grow big and strong that you ended up five light years tall, with a grip strength that could crush whole star systems. But if we assume he&#8217;s just straightforwardly right, and that Nature did something of about this level to chimps &#8211; then there might be enough space for the intra-human variation to be as big as the mouse-chimp-Joe variation.</p>
<p>How does this relate to our original concern &#8211; how fast we expect AI to progress?</p>
<p>The good news is that linear progress in AI would take a long time to cross the newly-vast expanse of the human level in domains like &#8220;common sense&#8221;, &#8220;scientific planning&#8221;, and &#8220;political acumen&#8221;, the same way it took a long time to cross it in chess.</p>
<p>The bad news is that if evolution was able to make humans so many orders of magnitude more intelligent in so short a time, then intelligence really is easy to scale up. Once you&#8217;ve got a certain level of general intelligence, you can just crank it up arbitrarily far by adding more inputs. Consider by analogy the hydrogen bomb &#8211; it&#8217;s very hard to invent, but once you&#8217;ve invented it you can make a much bigger hydrogen bomb just by adding more hydrogen.</p>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t match existing AI progress, where it takes a lot of work to make a better chess engine or self-driving car. Maybe it will match future AI progress, after some critical mass is reached. Or maybe it&#8217;s totally on the wrong track. I&#8217;m just having trouble thinking of any other explanation for why the human level could be so big.</p>",Yvain,scottalexander,Scott Alexander,

<p>I find it very useful to have a term that helps clarify that the map is not completely arbitrary and that there are things in the territory that are natural candidates for appearing in the map. For example, for the <a href=""https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=6&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjPzvnok7bVAhVIjLwKHbTbCSAQtwIISjAF&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.khanacademy.org%2Fpartner-content%2Fwi-phi%2Fwiphi-metaphysics-epistemology%2Fwiphi-metaphysics%2Fv%2Fship-of-theseus&amp;usg=AFQjCNHibtCJPbqK4Pd1CYmxyoTVVAbfvQ"">Ship of Thesus</a>, one natural candidate is the pure, original, unmodified ship; another are the fixed percentages (ie. 50% original); another would be a continuity based measure. If you are asked to create a definition of what counts as the Ship of Thesus, these are some of the first ideas that you would come up with, although you would of course need to define it in much, much more detail to get all the way down to the level of the territory.<br /><br />Or suppose you are trying to define what is meant by table. Again, the definition is purely arbitrary and whatever you choose, but there are certain natural structures in reality that pop out at you. One might be all four-legged, non-living objects with a flat top, another might relax the four-legged requirement so that it only required four legs at one particular time, ect.</p>
<p>When I'm explaining that a particular concept has been reified, it greatly clarifies my position to explain that I don't believe that the concept is empty, but there is *something* behind it that leads us to want that word. That something is really not a single thing (or else it would be real, not reified), but a collection of closely related 'natural structures'. Each of the definitions provided for the Ship of Thesus or a table corresponds to a different natural structure, while the term itself appears in the map. I hope you find this word useful too, but if you have any suggestions for a better term, please mention it in the comments.</p>",casebash,casebash,casebash,

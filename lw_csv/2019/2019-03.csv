Jvr9LubnvhhP6EvvN,What are effective strategies for mitigating the impact of acute sleep deprivation on cognition?,what-are-effective-strategies-for-mitigating-the-impact-of,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Jvr9LubnvhhP6EvvN/what-are-effective-strategies-for-mitigating-the-impact-of,2019-03-31T18:31:29.866Z,25,12,38,False,True,,"<html><head></head><body><p>I've recently been finding that I struggle much more with intellectual work (math, hard programming, writing, etc.) when I sleep less 6.5-7 hours. While I'm at peace with the fact that I seem to generally require &gt;7 hours a sleep, it's frustrating that even though I set aside enough time for adequate sleep, I'll often wake up after only ~6 hours of sleep and not be able to fall back asleep.</p>
<p>My cognitive ability seems to be impacted by a single night of bad sleep even when I've been sleeping well in the recent past. Concretely, if I've slept 8 hours every night for two weeks, a single night of poor sleep can still result in a ~50% less productive day.</p>
<p>In addition to impacting productivity, acute sleep deprivation also leaves me much less capable of entertaining myself by thinking, so I become much more inclined to seek out distracting forms of entertainment like scrolling through the internet. It also seems to increase my cravings for generally ""unhealthy"" foods (I've seen references to this in literature, but won't bother linking them since it's not the focus of my question).</p>
<p>Other useful notes about my general sleep habits/history include:</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm not sure if I've always been this sensitive to sleep deprivation and just notice it more due to a combination of more introspective and spending more time on certain activities or if something's changed and I've become more sensitive.</li>
<li>I generally have 1 cup of coffee in the morning around when I wake up. More cups of coffee do not seem to offset sleep deprivation's impact on my cognitive ability, and in fact have at times exacerbated it.</li>
<li>I've tried napping when it's fit with my schedule and each time ended up lying awake for the 20-40 minutes during which I intended to nap.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'd love to hear others' strategies for mitigating the impact of acute sleep deprivation on cognitive ability. I've done some preliminary searching for papers, articles, etc., but those that I've found focus on reducing tiredness rather than on returning cognitive ability to baseline. I'm open to trying strategies including but not limited to diet changes, supplements, medication, and habit changes.</p>

tCHsm5ZyAca8HfJSG,The Case for The EA Hotel,the-case-for-the-ea-hotel,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/tCHsm5ZyAca8HfJSG/the-case-for-the-ea-hotel,2019-03-31T12:31:30.969Z,57,24,26,False,False,,"<p> <strong>Epistemic Status: </strong>I strongly believe all the things I’m writing here.  These are mostly heuristics and mental models rather than hard data, which I think is necessary for a project so young.  I’m trying to make a strong case for the EA hotel, not a balanced one (although it will probably be balanced by the $100 on the line for articles taking the opposite view).</p><h1>The EA Chasm</h1><p>There’s <u><a href=""https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/G2Pfpkcwv3bJNF8o9/ea-is-vetting-constrained"">something </a><a href=""https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/oNY76m8DDWFiLo7nH/what-to-do-with-people"">broken</a></u> about the pipeline for both<u><a href=""https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/jmbP9rwXncfa32seH/after-one-year-of-applying-for-ea-jobs-it-is-really-really""> talent </a></u>and <u><a href=""https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/G2Pfpkcwv3bJNF8o9/ea-is-vetting-constrained"">projects</a></u> in the EA Community.  There’s a space in which there’s a lot of talented people in EA who want to do good, and there’s a lot of people with ideas about projects that could do good.  Finally, projects like <u><a href=""http://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/"">Charity Entrepreneurship</a></u> seem to indicate that there’s no shortage of ways to do good.  What’s missing is a way to go from a talented EA—with no evidence behind your project, no previous projects under your belt, and little status within the EA community—to someone who has enough capital to prove that their project has merit. </p><span><figure><img src=""http://mattgoldenberg.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/TheEAChasm.png"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:83%"" /></figure></span><p>This gap exists for a number of reasons, including strong risk aversion in the EA community, a lack of diversity in grant decision making processes, and a lack of manpower to vet hundreds of projects for the small amount of money they would need to prove themselves enough to move up to the “projects with strong evidence” category.  A number of solutions have also been proposed to fill in this gap, including an <u><a href=""https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/PagT8Fg6HZu6KjHDb/request-for-comments-ea-projects-evaluation-platform"">EA projects evaluation platform</a></u> and a suggestion for <u><a href=""https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/EP6X362Q3ziibA99e/show-a-framework-for-shaping-your-talent-for-direct-work"">EAs to work on Non-EA projects</a></u> in order to get a good track record and higher status (and thus be able to be hired or get grants).  However, both of these suggestions miss out on one of the big reasons the chasm needs to be filled—strong vetting is nice, but there’s no replacement for simply trying many things and seeing what works.</p><h2>Why The Chasm Matters</h2><p>This Chasm is a big deal for the community.  Organizations like CEA can work to guide the community towards a better future, and organizations like Charity Entrepreneurship can slowly work to allow more organizations that do good work.  But by not tapping into the creativity and sheer variety of thought of the bottom two sections of the picture above, the EA community is losing out on a large number of utils that come from trying a lot of things from a diversity of perspectives, creating tight feedback loops, and seeing what works.  </p><p>Silicon Valley is great proof of this concept.  While it’s true that the <u><a href=""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DblPXyQV4AApmWL.jpg:large"">standards for seed funding have been growing </a></u>in recent years (and this may be another factor in the EA model, if they’re trying to copy Silicon Valley), it’s also true that <u><a href=""https://fi.co/"">preseed accelerators with extremely low vetting standards</a></u> have still generated tens of billions of dollars worth of value.  EA, with a surplus of ideas that don’t have capital to get off the ground, and a surplus of talented individuals willing to work on these ideas, should view this is a neglected opportunity to do a lot of good for the world. And they should view the EA Hotel as a wonderful proof of concept for an organization looking to fill in this Chasm.</p><h1>The EA Hotel is More Effective Than Directly Sponsoring Individuals or Projects</h1><p>One way to view the EA hotel is as a grant giving organization that pays for people’s living expenses for a period of time, while those people have opportunities to prove that their projects are good enough to get to the next stage of funding.  For EAs who are still looking for projects, it provides a bridge to focus on gaining skills and knowledge while getting chances to join new projects as they circulate through the hotel.</p><p>When the EA hotel is looked at in this light, the question then becomes “does it make more sense to fund individual projects and EAs, rather than letting the EA hotel fund them for you?” The EA Hotel has several features that make it a more effective option.</p><h2>No Rent</h2><p>The largest living expense for most people (especially the large number of EAs in London, Oxford, and the Bay Area) is rent. When sponsoring someone yourself, most of your money will be going into that black hole.  The EA hotel has done the efficient thing and bought the hotel outright.  This means that rent is not something you as a funder have to pay, and the longer the hotel lasts and the more residents it helps, the more efficient this mechanism becomes over paying rent.</p><h2>Cheap Cost of Living and Lower Standard of Living</h2><p>One unique thing about the EA hotel as a grant-giving mechanism is that it forces the residents to move to Blackpool.  While there are some downsides to this, I think there are two huge upsides from a cost-effectiveness perspective.  The first is that the <u><a href=""https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/in/Blackpool"">cost of living </a></u>is extremely low.  Just like with rent, funding the EA hotel here consistently makes your money go further than funding a random EA who would choose their own place to live.  </p><p>Another important fact is that standard of living here is simply lower.  While trying to be extremely frugal in San Francisco, I couldn’t help but notice that my standard of living and happiness was impacted by those around me.  However, as a consequence of living in Blackpool, and a secondary consequence of only having my savings and a small living stipend, I’ve found that I’ve been happier with a much cheaper standard of living in Blackpool.  There’s some data that shows that how standard of living impacts happiness is <u><a href=""https://www.grossnationalhappiness.com/9-domains/standard-of-living-and-happiness/"">relative to others in your immediate environment,</a></u> and is not absolute.  This means that I can be happy and productive at a much cheaper cost at the EA hotel than at a group house in Berkeley, and your donation dollars can stretch further.</p><h2>Propinquity and Collaboration</h2><p>By putting all of the projects together under the same roof, the EA hotel does an excellent job of fostering connections, encouraging collaborations, and creating a strong environment for serendipity and synergy among projects.  In my short time here, I’ve seen a methodologist help an organization with designing their RCT, a coder help a different organization automate one of their biggest bottlenecks, and an organization which needed help on measuring impact get help from someone who had written an important paper on the matter.  More importantly than these individual collaborations, I’ve seen people’s ideas grow and develop as they get exposed to critiques and new ways of thinking.  This is an effect you simply don’t get if you sponsor projects separately instead of as a group.</p><h2>Superconnecting and Status Building</h2><p>The final thing I’ve seen from the EA hotel is that, while being in a cheap, out-of-the-way city, it’s enough of a unique attraction (and there’s always enough free rooms available) that it has become a ‘destination’ for EAs to check out when they’re in Europe.  This is an important fact, as normally one of the benefits of being in a more expensive city (and one of the reasons most startup incubators are located there) is that it allows you to begin building connections with the people you’ll need to know when moving to the next stage of the pyramid.  However, by having the “hotel” aspect, and becoming a destination, the EA hotel manages to attract a steady stream of individuals from all aspects of the EA community.  It has managed to become an effective networking hub while being in a city with a cheap cost of living, and has achieved something for projects that merely funding them to live on their own could not.</p><h1>The EA Hotel Is An Effective Incubator</h1><p>Thus far, I’ve made the case that there’s a surplus of potential in the EA community, and a Chasm that needs to be filled to use the surplus.  I’ve also made the case that something like the EA Hotel is an effective way to fill that Chasm.  What I haven’t done is make the case that this particular team and project have done a good job of realizing that goal.  </p><p>In the following section, I’ll attempt to give my inside view of why I believe the project and team are suited for filling the goal, as a 3-month resident of the hotel, and someone who has witnessed and created other teams and cultures.</p><h2>Correct Acceptance Standards</h2><p>One persistent criticism of the hotel is that it has too low standards for what projects it accepts.  However, the standard that the hotel has (accept everyone when there’s space, and only prioritize when they’re over capacity) is the correct choice for an organization that’s trying to fill the Chasm like the EA hotel is. </p><p>Let’s return to our Silicon Valley metaphor, and the pre-seed incubator I alluded to earlier, The Founders Institute.  The Founders Institute, while I don’t think they admit it publicly, has a similar policy of accepting as many candidates as there are slots, and trying to maximize the amount of projects rather than having some perceived quality cutoff.  The Founders Institute knows two things.</p><ol><li>At this stage in their career, it’s very hard to vet first time founders.  Without a track record, all they have to go on is charisma and clarity of thought, which is actually something that many first time founders will only learn only through the process of creating their first startup.</li><li>Sometimes the best ideas look completely ridiculous.  Consider the idea of creating a website where strangers can rent out their homes to other strangers.</li></ol><p>So instead, the Founders Institute does something else—it implements a series of tight feedback loops and standards, causing founders to have to prove both themselves and their projects to graduate the program.  While the acceptance rate for the Founders institute is very high, the graduation rate is only around 30%.  The hope is that most of those 30% have achieved enough in their project to get them a more traditional seed round.</p><p>Similarly, the EA hotel has weekly check-ins to gauge the progress of their participants, and is working on implementing more stringent feedback loops for the people who enter the hotel.  The goal, instead of trying to vet the people and projects up front, is to use the process itself to vet the project and the individual.  As they pass increasingly high bars, they eventually cross the bar where they achieve good evidence for their project, and can then move on to the next stage of the pyramid.  If it turns out they can’t meet that bar, they go back down to the previous stage of the pyramid, work on leveling up, and try again when they think they’re ready.</p><h2>Removing Trivial Inconveniences</h2><p>As a creator or early participant in a new project, focus is everything.  Time and attention are wasted when put toward things other than those that directly work to impact your biggest metrics, or validate your biggest assumptions. Furthermore, the type of work you have to do to validate or invalidate these assumptions is scary, hard, and often emotionally draining.  Every little bit of energy that you can save by not having to deal with trivial inconveniences is a blessing.</p><p>At the EA Hotel, my grocery shopping is taken care of for me.  Dinners are cooked for me.  Grab and go food for breakfast and lunch is restocked without my having to think about it.  My dishes are done for me.  My sheets are changed for me.  All of this allows me to avoid an  incredible amount of context switching that simply doesn’t have to happen because the EA Hotel recognizes the importance of focus.  Furthermore, they’re always improving.  A big portion of the managers’ job is finding trivial inconveniences and removing them.  Areas get more organized over time, systems get refined over time, busy work gets removed over time.  This is exactly the environment that I expect to be able to more effectively create valuable projects over time.</p><h2>A Productivity Culture</h2><p>I’ve been a part of several group houses in which a large portion of the people who lived there worked from home.  I’ve been a part of at least one attempt to instill a strong culture of working hard when in the presence of your peers.  There’s only <u><a href=""https://www.cityyear.org/boston"">one culture</a></u> that I’ve been a part of that I think has more of a culture of productivity than the EA Hotel, and I’d say it’s in the top 5-10% of creating and sustaining strong organizational cultures, including both for-profits and non-profits (so much so that it has been called cult-like).</p><p>I think that the attitude towards trivial inconveniences is a big part of this.  The idea that the management is clearing so much space for work creates a culture where everyone is simply working.  I should note that when bringing this to the EA hotel, there was at least one person who said he doesn’t believe the EA Hotel has enough of a productivity culture. When polled, everyone else present agreed that they’re more productive here than they have been in any other context.  This is a huge boon for an organization trying to vet projects as quickly as possible, and somehow the EA hotel does this better than any other co-living situation I’ve been a part of.</p><h2>A Growth Culture</h2><p>One of the big pushes the EA hotel has made in the last few months is to foster a culture of growth.  There are weekly talks by members of the hotel that are highly attended. There are weekly opportunities for debugging bottlenecks in your life, and learning new skills to make that debugging more effective.  A sizable portion of the hotel attends the local gym, and there is someone to go with almost every day of the week, at various times that suit you.  </p><p>As important as these individual activities are, the most important thing is the culture that develops around them.  Growth is accepted and expected at the EA hotel, and that’s important for people creating new projects and learning the skills as they go. </p><h2>A Support Culture</h2><p>Another big  shift I’ve seen the EA hotel make in the past few months is towards a culture of support.  In concrete terms, you can see this in the sizable population of people who participate in morning and nightly hugs, greeting each other with a strong hug the first and last time they see each other every day.  It’s also strongly visible in the existence of a Hotel Guest Representative, whose main job is to listen when hotel residents are having a hard time and look out for their interests.  It’s visible in the nightly group dinner, and the easy discussion that usually accompanies it.  However, it’s more visible in the day-to-day interactions you have with guests, such as when someone offered to bring food up to my room when I was sick, or seeing the celebration when a guest got their paper published in a journal.</p><p>Creating a project from scratch is hard, first time startup founders often find themselves falling into depression and loneliness, failing simply because they don’t have the support to take on the demands of the job.  The support culture of the EA Hotel goes a long way towards making it more bearable.</p><h2>Consistent Improvement</h2><p>A final thing that has impressed me about the EA hotel is the ability of Greg and the trustees to take feedback and improve the concept over time.  I’ve already mentioned the changes I’ve seen in the past few months, but an even better sign to me is the way Greg listens to criticism and responds to feedback.  Whenever he hears a good idea, it’s immediately written down, and the best ideas are tested and implemented over time.  This gives me cause to believe that the EA hotel hasn’t just lucked onto the above aspects of its culture, but is likely to continue to develop into an even more effective organization over time.</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>I’ve made three major claims in this post.  First, I’ve made the claim that EA as a movement could be doing a lot more good if it filled the Chasm in its pipeline.  Second, I’ve argued that something like the EA Hotel is a good way to fill this Chasm.  Finally, I’ve argued that the EA Hotel has functioned well as an organization dedicated to filling this Chasm, and that there’s reason to believe it will continue to do well in the future.  While I don’t think it’s impossible the EA Hotel could fail at this goal, my inside view gives me confidence that it’s very likely to succeed.  However, even with the outside view, I believe the models given in this post make the case that the EA Hotel, if successful, would be highly useful in expectation, and make a strong cost-effectiveness case for an EA Hotel like project if you think those models are accurate.  I look forward to your feedback and comments.</p><h1>About Me</h1><p>I’m Matt Goldenberg.  I’ve been living at the EA Hotel for about three months, and I’m due to leave in another three.

It’s pretty simple:</p><p><em>Planning is the selection of actions in order to achieve desired outcomes. </em>[1] </p><p>The need for planning arises when the following conditions hold:</p><ul><li>There are multiple states that the world can be in.</li><li>You have preferences over which states the world is in.</li><li>There are multiple actions available to you, each of which might cause the world to more likely be in some states rather than others.</li><li>You cannot take all of the actions, either because you lack the resources to do so or because the actions are inherently exclusive.</li></ul><p>These conditions lead to a refinement of the definition above: planning is the selection of actions <em>from among competing alternatives</em>. One must prioritize among one’s available options and allocate resources to whichever options rank most highly. </p><p>Often one is allocating resources among multiple options in proportion to their priority, but I think we can still rightly call it <em>prioritization</em> even when one is only deciding between allocating 100% of their resources to only one option of out two. In other words, <em>all of planning is prioritization. </em>[2]</p><h1>Planning is a Prediction/Information Problem</h1><p>On what basis should we select or prioritize one action over another? Of course, we should select whichever actions <em>we most expect</em> to lead us to the worlds we most prefer. We should choose actions based on the Expected Value (EV) we assign to them.</p><p>And therein lies one of the core challenges of planning. <em>Expecting </em>is just another word for <em>predicting. </em>And predicting is just a word which means assigning each action a probability distribution over the world states it will result in. That’s hard to do well.</p><p>Planning is hard because predicting is hard. Of course, predicting is a lot easier when you have more information, but usually we have far less than we’d like, so planning is hard because of limited information. Planning is a prediction problem and an information problem. </p><p>People of think of planning as being about “doing”, but in truth planning is just as much about “knowing”. One thing this amounts to is that the instrumental rationality involved in planning is inseparable from the epistemic rationality of having true beliefs, good models, and making accurate predictions. Any planner’s ability is going to be capped by their epistemic skill.</p><p>What we can do with this realization is that in any situation where we’re planning, we can pay deliberate attention to the predictions we need to make, the information we have, and ways in which might be able to make better predictions. (I call this the <em>Information Context </em>of a plan.) Alternatively stated, one can begin to approach planning with an <em>uncertainty reduction mindset </em>[3]. Rather than allocating all of one’s resources from the outset, one instead allocates a portion of the resources towards “purchasing” information which improves the subsequent allocation of the rest via improved prediction. </p><p>We do this already in many cases (reading reviews, asking friends, trials), but the occasions where we fail to do this can <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xrrycug4DWSdqBhjQ/plans-are-recursive-and-why-this-is-important#Almost_All_Plans_are_Sub_Plans__Almost_All_Goals_are_Sub_Goals"">cost us big time</a>: the student who didn’t research before starting law school, the company that spent years developing a product before testing with users, the couple who rushed into marriage, etc. (Not the only cause, but emotions often make us impatient to go all out with an option without adequate consideration.)</p><p>Unfortunately, while it’s easy to say that getting more information and reducing uncertainty is a good thing, there’s still a lot of complexity in managing uncertainty. Knowing how much is okay and how to efficiently reduce it. Still, always remembering that prediction is a core challenge of planning is a start.</p><h1>Planning is a Computation Problem</h1><p>Unfortunately, even having all the right information and perfect prediction would not be enough to make planning easy. Even when one can perfectly predict the outcome of all alternative options, planning often gives rise to intractably large computational problems which are <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-completeness"">NP-Complete</a>. (I provide a small mathematical treatment in <em><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ZJzSxo6nCNvod67Xs/why-planning-is-hard-a-multifaceted-model#Yjy9T8fYKe2XrzxwQ"">this comment below</a></em>.)</p><p>We are usually allocating a finite set of resources (our time, our money) amount a set of options in order to accomplish a variety of goals. Example: I might care about my health, entertainment, career, friendships, romance, art, and education. Towards these values, I could in a given week: sleep, play tennis, go to the gym, watch Netflix, work late, call up by bestie, go on Tinder, draw a picture, read a textbook, etc. I get to allocate my time to some combination of activities, but the thing is, the number of possible combinations for allocating my time in a single week is mind-boggling. </p><p>A super-simplified example: I have 30 discretionary hours in a week and 10 possible activities I could spend each of those hours on, but I only spend time on activities in two-hour blocks. This results in 10^(30/2) = 10^15 = <em>one thousand trillion different combinations</em> of how I could spend my time that week. Even if I could perfectly predict how much I’d like each combination of time usage, I could never consider them all explicitly. </p><p>This computational complexity was very salient to me in my last job as a Product Manager where every six weeks I would choose which projects my team of Data Scientists would work on. Under ideal circumstances, I might get to choose ten projects out of a candidate twenty projects. Choosing was hard, especially since in addition to pure value of each project, I had to juggle the facts that: a) projects were often not independent, b) projects often have future costs, e.g. maintenance and tech debt, c) there are costs to not doing or delaying some projects, d) the benefits of different projects are spread over different time horizons, e) projects aren’t commensurate, e.g. protecting downside risk vs building new functionality, f) some projects are necessary to preserve future optionality, g) budget constraints were soft, I could sometimes steal time from elsewhere it meant I could select a better set of projects.</p><p>Even if I’d had perfect information and prediction, which I certainly didn’t, the number of possibilities was large enough to be intractable by any analytical method of prioritization.</p><p>I am least certain about how to best tackle the computation problem of planning, but my current guess is that very much relies on effectively using our instinctive, intuitive, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_process_theory"">System 1</a> thinking in conjunction with our System 2 thinking. System 1 is better at handling problems too large to be consciously considered, while System 2 can ensure that System 1 is paying attention to all the relevant considerations. I like <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost%E2%80%93benefit_analysis"">cost-benefit analyses</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_matrix"">decision-matrices</a> not because I think they should make the final decision, but because I think the exercise of creating them loads the right information into System 1.</p><h1>Planning is a Self-Knowledge &amp; Self-Mastery Problem</h1><p>In a three-fold manner, planning is a problem of self-knowledge and self-mastery.</p><h3>Predicting yourself</h3><p>The first problem of planning stated was that of prediction and information. With the exception of plans made for teams, organizations, countries, and the like, your plans will concern yourself and your actions. That means that invariably one of the most important things to be able to predict is yourself. </p><p>Sometimes this is hard because we lack information. It might be hard to predict how you will behave or feel in novel circumstances. Other times it can be hard to predict ourselves because we are averse to making the best possible predictions we could. We refuse to admit that realistically we are not going to get up at 6am to go to the gym.</p><p>A particular aspect of yourself which it is key to be able to predict is your motivation. Plans which rely on unrealistic predictions about how <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/EkEYLkcxT8Wd2HS9W/motivation-you-have-to-win-in-the-moment"">motivated you will feel</a> while executing the plans are probably going to be unsuccessful plans.</p><p>Advice I have for this aspect of planning is a) start paying attention to yourself and to predicting yourself, fortunately usually you have a lot of data to work with, b) adopt a policy of radical-self honesty, <a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Litany_of_Gendlin"">what is true is already so</a> and good predictions are the basis of good plans.</p><h3>Knowing what you want</h3><p>This post started with the definition that planning is the selection of actions towards desired outcomes. It is rather important that you correctly identify your actual desired outcomes, otherwise, any actions you select <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xrrycug4DWSdqBhjQ/plans-are-recursive-and-why-this-is-important#A_goal_is_only_right_if_it_actually_serves_your_higher_level_goals"">aren’t likely to be worth much</a>. “I thought I wanted X actually but I didn’t” is too often the foil of a supposedly successful plan where the planner evidently lacked good self-prediction.</p><p>I’m of the belief that one’s deep-down desired outcomes (personal and moral) are contained inside one’s brain, regardless of whether one has achieved good conscious access to them or inferred all the consequences of them. Much of good planning is reducing uncertainty around what is that you actually want and value. </p><p>Self-prediction is a special case of the general prediction/information problem, but it requires different techniques of uncertainty reduction than outside-world prediction does. Introspective methods such as <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/mELQFMi9egPn5EAjK/my-attempt-to-explain-looking-insight-meditation-and"">meditation</a>, <a href=""https://medium.com/@ThingMaker/focusing-for-skeptics-6b949ef33a4f"">Focusing</a>, <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5gfqG3Xcopscta3st/building-up-to-an-internal-family-systems-model"">Internal</a> <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5gfqG3Xcopscta3st/building-up-to-an-internal-family-systems-model"">Family</a> <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5gfqG3Xcopscta3st/building-up-to-an-internal-family-systems-model"">Systems</a>, etc. are helpful for having better knowledge of which outcomes you actually want.</p><p>Of course, complicating the discovery of what <em>your</em> desired outcomes are is that the notion of <em>you</em> may be a little complicated. I have been persuaded over the years that it can be very useful to think of <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/ZbmRyDN8TCpBTZSip"">yourself as being made up of parts or sub-agents</a>, each with their own particular desires. Mastering yourself means coming to understand your parts and their desires leading into an ability to make plans that satisfy all yourself. This can be crucial as making plans which parts of you are not onboard often causes those parts to undermine the plan.</p><p>Relatedly, “making yourself do something” should always be a warning sign that some part of you is being disregarded. Sometimes that’s legitimate, but really only if you’re accounting for it in your self-predictions and how it’s going to affect overall success. </p><h3>Self-mastery of your human brain</h3><p>Human brains are really, really good, but they’re also really complicated with a lot of different moving pieces and no user manual. Most of us manage, but there are gains to be had from better at operating our own minds.</p><h4>Heuristics and biases</h4><p>To get better at predicting, it helps to understand when our brains natively do and don’t make good predictions of their own accord. That leads directly into heuristics and biases and attempts to become <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/5g5TkQTe9rmPS5vvM/p/ptxnyfLWqRZ98wnYi"">a</a> <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/5g5TkQTe9rmPS5vvM/p/ptxnyfLWqRZ98wnYi"">lens</a> <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/5g5TkQTe9rmPS5vvM/p/ptxnyfLWqRZ98wnYi"">which</a> <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/5g5TkQTe9rmPS5vvM/p/ptxnyfLWqRZ98wnYi"">sees</a> <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/5g5TkQTe9rmPS5vvM/p/ptxnyfLWqRZ98wnYi"">its</a> <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/5g5TkQTe9rmPS5vvM/p/ptxnyfLWqRZ98wnYi"">flaws</a>.</p><h4>Using System 1 (intuition) and System 2 (explicit reason) in harmony</h4><p>Human brains run on both and each system has its advantages and disadvantages. The human who is leveraging their brain to its fullest extent is using all of their mind in harmony, not privileging or disregarding one kind of thinking inappropriately. This hard though, but really a key part of getting good at planning. </p><h4>Emotional Mastery</h4><p>Arguably emotions could be lumped under System 1, but it’s worth calling them out separately. While emotions serve multiple purposes, one of the things they do is carry an important signal of information from your subconscious mind. If you feel anxious about something or having a niggling doubt or whatever, that’s because there’s a part of your mind has been processing raw data and finding it significant. The skilled planner and predictor will be someone who can extract that valuable information from their emotions.</p><p>However, emotional mastery is perhaps even more important to planning in another way. Many, many plans are bad plans because people lapse into optimizing for their emotions rather than actual long-term desired outcomes. A person who rushes into a plan with inadequate information because they dislike being in a state of indecision is likely choosing a worse plan because they were unable to handle their unpleasant emotions. Or a person who only executes extremely conservative plans because anything bold makes them too feel anxious. I believe schools of thought which help with emotional mastery such as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance_and_commitment_therapy"">ACT</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy"">CBT</a>, and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_behavior_therapy"">DBT</a> have a place among the training materials for great planners.</p><h1>Planning is a Recursive Problem</h1><p>We’ve covered that planning requires identifying your options, predicting their outcomes, evaluating the goodness of said outcomes, and then somehow crunching through all the different combinations of possible actions to select the best overall set. </p><p>Except <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xrrycug4DWSdqBhjQ/plans-are-recursive-and-why-this-is-important"">planning is recursive</a>. Any difficult plan is going to be composed of multiple sub-plans and for each one of those sub-plans the whole process needs to repeated again: identifying options, making predictions, selecting combinations, etc.</p><p>First, this adds to the already extensive amount of computation involved in planning. Second, it can often cause plans to span multiple domains straining all but the most versatile generalists. Have pity for the aspiring baker whose plan was to make the best muffins in town, but now has to figure out double-entry accounting and US tax code. Or the physicist-cum-founder who wanted to create clean energy technologies but now needs to figure out a sales and marketing strategy too.</p><p>At a base level, the challenges of good planning remain constant between domains, e.g. making good predictions, as well the advisable steps, e.g. reducing uncertainty. Yet the concrete steps for doing these might look very different. The physicist-founder might have been very good at reducing uncertainty in the laboratory with experiments, but the feedback loop for iterating on sales strategy might be completely different, even if in both cases you’re trying to reduce uncertainty.</p><p>Shifting between domains is probably a reason why people who are good at reducing uncertainty and planning in some domains are negligent in others. Arguably, the skilled planner is going to figure out the right specific techniques to achieve good plans across all the domains they touch. In some domains, you might have lots of experts you can poll; in others it might be cheap to run experiments; in some you can build good explicit models; in others it’s all about training intuition; and yet in further cases it might not be easy at all and you’re left trying to draw tenuous inferences from historical example.</p><h1>Summary: What It Takes to Be a Great Planner</h1><p>We can neatly summarize why planning can be so difficult with a list of all the traits one should have in order to overcome the difficulties.</p><ul><li>One must be excellent at making predictions across domains, helped by their mastery of epistemic skill and virtue.</li><li>One must be skilled at identifying which information one needs yet lacks and at executing sub-plans to efficiently obtain this information across different domains and the disparate techniques required to do so.</li><li>One must be skilled at making choices within combinatorially explosive problems involving the selection of combinations of multiple options towards multiple goals via the use of heuristics, excellent intuition/instinct, or some other reliable method.</li><li>One must be able to make use of their System 1 and System 2 to think in harmony.</li><li>One must have knowledge of their true values, goals, and desired states of the world.</li><li>One must have knowledge of their sub-parts and alignment between them so that one does not undermine oneself.</li><li>One must be able to predict one’s own behavior including the behavior of one’s motivations and emotions so that one can plan effectively around them.</li><li>One must be able to reduce uncertainty about one’s self-model via experiments or introspective tools.</li><li>One must be able to listen to the information contained in their emotions.</li><li>One must not let their emotions coerce them into plans which sate their emotions while sacrificing their overall goals.</li><li>One must be able to plan effectively up and down the recursive tree of their plans: enumerating, evaluating, and reducing uncertainty wherever needed.</li></ul><br><h1>Endnotes</h1><p>[1] This broad definition stands in opposition to a common definition which uses planning primarily in contexts of scheduling, e.g. plan your day, plan your week. The broader definition here is essentially synonymous with decision-making, perhaps differing only in connotation. Decisions somewhat imply a one-off choice between options whereas planning implies selection of multiple actions to be taken over time. The term planning also somewhat more than decision-making highlights that there is a goal one wishes to achieve.</p><p>[2] I often hear people faced with clear prioritization tasks plead that they need more resource, that resource scarcity is the problem. Sometimes it is, sometimes the best action is to get more resources. But often it is a fallacy to think that if you can't solve prioritization now, it will somehow be easier when you have more resources. However many resources you have, they will be finite and you will still be able to think of things you'd like to do with even more resources, things which feel <em>just as necessary</em>. In short, you should get used to choosing sooner rather than later. </p><p>[3] To be technical, uncertainty reduction is about concentrating the probability mass of your prior distribution into narrower bands. </p>",,Ruby,ruby,Ruby

Different people trying to accomplish different things. <u><a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OeOQnUbKa1jS3t2A7SdNdHfTGj3IC9CDSWVXkqcNaQw/edit?usp=sharing"">Going over the questions</a></u>, I see rough clusters, listed pretty much in order of descending prevalence:</p><ol><li><strong>Asking for recommendations, feedback, and personal experience.</strong></li><ol><li>“Which self-help has helped you?”, “Is there a way to hire academics hourly?”</li></ol><li><strong>Asking for personal advice.</strong></li><ol><li>“What’s the best way to improve my English pronunciation?”</li></ol><li><strong>Asking conceptual/philosophy/ideology/models/theory type question.</strong></li><ol><li>“What are the components of intellectual honesty?”</li></ol><li><strong>Asking for opinions</strong></li><ol><li>“How does OpenAI&#x27;s language model affect our AI timeline estimates?”</li></ol><li><strong>Asking for help studying a topic.</strong></li><ol><li>“What are some concrete problems about logical counterfactuals?”, “Is the human brain a valid choice choice of Universal Turing Machine . . . ?”</li></ol><li><strong>Asking general research/lit-review-ish questions (not sure how to name)</strong></li><ol><li>“Does anti-malaria charity destroy the local anti-malaria industry?”, “Understanding Information Cascades”, “How large is the fallout area of the biggest cobalt bomb we can build?”</li></ol><li><strong>Asking open research-type questions (not sure to how name this cluster)</strong></li><ol><li>“When is CDT Dutch-Bookable?”, “How does Gradient Descent Interact with Goodhart?”, “Understanding Information Cascades”</li></ol></ol><p></p><p><em>These questions are roughly ordered from &quot;high prevalence + easier to answer&quot; to &quot;low prevalence + harder to answer&quot;.</em></p><p></p><p>A few things stick out. I know the team has noticed already, but want to list them here anyway is part of the bigger argument. The questions which are most prevalent are those which are: </p><ol><li>relatively quick to ask, e.g. write a few paragraphs at most.</li><li>there is a [relatively] large population of people who are qualified to answer.</li><li>the kind of questions people are used to asking elsewhere, e.g. CFAR Alumni Mailing List, Facebook, Reddit, LessWrong (posts and comments) Quora, StackExchange.</li><li>the kinds of questions for which there are existing forums, as above.</li><li>they can answered primarily using the answerer’s existing knowledge, e.g. people who answer advanced math problems but using their existing understanding.</li><li>the questions can be answered in a single session at one’s computer, often without needing even to open another browser tab.</li></ol><p>What is apparent is that questions which break from the above trends, e.g. questions which can be hard to explain (taking a long to write up), require skill/expertise to answer, can’t be answered purely from an answerer’s existing knowledge (unless by fluke they’re expert in a niche area), and require more effort than simply typing an answer or explanation -- <strong>these questions are really of a very different kind. They’re a very different category and both asking and answering such questions is a very different <u>activity</u> from asking the other kind.</strong></p><p>What we see is that LessWrong’s Q&amp;A is doing very well with the first kind -- the kind  of questions people are already used to asking and answering elsewhere. There’s been roughly a question per day for the three months Q&amp;A has been live, but the overwhelming majority are requests for recommendations and advice, opinions, and philosophical discussion. Only a small minority (no more than a couple dozen) are solid research-y questions.</p><p>There’ve been a few of the “help me understand”/confusions type you might see on StackExchange (which I think are real good). And a few pure research-y type questions, but around half of those were asked by the LessWrong team and friends. Around 10% of questions, really on the order of 10 questions or less in the last three months by my count. </p><p>I think these latter questions are more the sort we’d judge to be “actual serious intellectual progress”, or at least, those are the questions we’d love to see people asking more. They’re the kinds of questions that predominantly the LessWrong team is creating rather than users.</p><h1>2. Our vision for Q&amp;A is getting people to do a new and effortful thing. That’s hard.</h1><p>The previous section can be summarized as follows:</p><ul><li>Q&amp;A has been getting used since it was launched, but primarily by people do things they were already used to doing elsewhere. And things which are relatively low effort.</li><li>The vision for Q&amp;A is scaling up intellectual progress on important problems. Doing real research. People taking their large questions, carving of pieces, people going off and making their own contributions of research (without hiring and all that overhead).</li></ul><p><strong>The thing about the LW vision for Q&amp;A is that it means getting people to do a new and different thing from what they’re used to, plus that thing is way more effort. </strong>It’s not impossible, but it is hard. </p><p>It’s not a new and better way to do something they’re already doing, it’s a new thing they haven’t even dreamt of. Moreover, it looks like something else which they are used to, e.g. Quora, StackExchange, Facebook - so that’s how they use it and how they expect other to use it by default. The term “category creation” comes to mind, if that means anything. AirBnB was new category. LessWrong is trying to create a new category, but it looks like existing categories.</p><h1>3. Bounties: the potential solution and its challenges</h1><p>The most straightforward way to get people to expend effort is to pay them. Or create the possibility of payment. Hence bounties. Done right, I think bounties could work, but I think it’s going to be a tough uphill battle to implement them in a way which does work. </p><p><strong>[Edited: </strong>Raemon has asked <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/zEMzFGhRt4jZwyJqt/what-would-you-need-to-be-motivated-to-answer-hard-lw"">a question about incentives/bounties for answering &quot;hard</a> <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/zEMzFGhRt4jZwyJqt/what-would-you-need-to-be-motivated-to-answer-hard-lw"">questions.&quot;</a> Fitting in this paradigm here, we&#x27;d really value further answers.] </p><h1>4. Challenges facing bounties (and Q&amp;A in general)</h1><ul><li>Even if we have a system which works well, <strong>it’s going to be new and different</strong> and we’re going to have to work to get users to understand it and adopt it. A lot user education and training.</li><ul><li>The closest analogue I can think of is Kaggle competitions, but they’re still pretty different: clear objective evaluation, you build transparently valuable skills, it feels good to get a high rank even if you don’t win, there are career rewards just for participating and doing relatively well.</li></ul><li>Uncertainty around payment. People might do a lot of work for money, but the incentive is much weaker if you’re unsure if you’ll get paid. People decide whether it’s based on EV, not the absolute number of dollars pledged.</li><ul><li>And you might not be bothered to read and understand complicated bounty rules.</li></ul><li>People with questions and placing bounties might not trust the research quality of whoever random person happens to answer.</li><ul><li>A mathematical review can be checked, but it’s harder to that with lit reviews and generalist research.</li><li>Evaluating research quality might require a significant fraction of the effort required to do the research in the first place.</li></ul><li>People with questions might usually have a deeper, vaguer, general question they’re trying to answer. They want the actual thing answered, not a particular sub-question which may or may not be answered. Eli spoke of desiring that someone would become expert in a topic so they could then ask them lots of questions about it.</li><li>With Q&amp;A, it’s challenging for the asker and answerer to have a good feedback loop as the answerer is working. It would seem to be harder for the the answerer to asking clarifying questions and share intermediate results (and thereby get feedback), and harder for the asker to ask further follow-up question. This gets worse once there are multiple people working on the question, all potentially needing further time and attention from the asker in order to do a good job.</li><li>Q&amp;A (even with bounties) face the two-sided marketplace problem. Question askers aren’t going to bother writing up large and difficult to explain questions if they don’t expect to get answered. (Even less so if they try once and fail to get a response worth the effort). Potential answerers aren’t going to make it a habit to research for a platform which doesn’t have many real research questions (mostly stuff about freeze dried mussel powder and English pronunciation and what not).</li></ul><h1>5. What would it take to get it to work</h1><p>Thinking about the challenges, it seems it could be made to work if we following happens:</p><ul><li>We successfully get both askers and answerers to understand that LW’s Q&amp;A is something distinctly different from other things they’re used. </li><ul><li>UI changes, tags, renaming things, etc. might all help, plus explanatory posts and hands-on training with people.</li><li>Making becoming a question answerer a high-status thing would certainly help. If Luke or Eliezer or Nate were seen using the platform, might give it a lot of endorsement/legitimacy.</li></ul><li>We successfully incentivize question answerers to expend the necessary effort to answer research questions.</li><ul><li>This is partly through monetary reward, but might also include having them believe that they’re actually helping on something important, are actually getting status. (Weekly or monthly prizes for best answers - separate from bounties - might be a way to do that. Or heck, a leaderboard for Q&amp;A contributions adjusted by karma.)</li></ul><li>We get question askers to actually believe they can get real serious progress on questions for Q&amp;A.</li><ul><li>Easiest to do once we have some examples. Proof of concept goes a long way. Get a few wins and we talk about them with researchers, show them that it works.</li><ul><li>It’s getting those first few examples which is going to be hardest. As they say, the first ten clients always require hustle.</li></ul></ul><li>We ensure that question answerers have a positive ROI experience for all the time spent writing up questions, reading the response, etc., etc.</li><li>We somehow address concerns that research might not be reliable because you don’t fully trust the research ability of people on the internet - especially not when you’re trying to make important decisions on the basis of your research.</li></ul><p>Even then, I think getting it to work will depend on understand which research questions can be well handled by this kind of system.</p><h1>6. My Uncertainties/Questions</h1><p>Much of what I’m saying here is coming from thinking hard about Q&amp;A for several days, using models from startups in general, and some limited user interaction. I could just be wrong about several of the assumptions being used above.</p><p>Some of the key questions I want answered to be more sure of models are:</p><ul><li>What are the beliefs/predictions/anticipations about Q&amp;A of our ideal question askerer’s?</li><ul><li>In particular, do they think it could actually help them with their work? If not, why not? If yes, how?</li><li>Is trust a real issue for them? Are worried about research quality?</li><li>Do they have “discrete” questions they can ask, or is it usually some deeper topic they want someone to spend several days becoming an expert on?</li></ul><li>What is the willingness of ideal question answerers to answer questions on Q&amp;A?</li><ul><li>Which incentives matter to them? (Impact, status, money) How well do they view current Q&amp;A as meeting them?</li><ul><li>Do they feel like they’re actually doing valuable work in answering questions? </li></ul></ul></ul><p>There are other questions, but that’s a starter.</p><h1>7. Alternative Idea: Marketplace for Intellectual Labor</h1><p>Once you’re talking about paying out bounties for people researching answers, you’re most of the way towards just outright hiring people to do work. A marketplace. TaskRabbit/Craigslist for intellectual labor. I can see that being a good idea. </p><h2>How it would work</h2><ul><li>People wanting to be hired have “profiles” on LW which include anything relevant to their ability to do intellectual labor. Links to CV, LinkedIn, questions answered on Q&amp;A, karma, etc.</li><ul><li>The profiles may be public or private or semi-private.</li></ul><li>People seeking to hire intellectual labor can create “tasks”</li><li>Work can be assigned in two directions.</li><ul><li>Hirers can post their tasks publicly and then people bid/offer to work on the task.</li><li>Hirers can browse the list of people who have created profiles and reach out to people they’re interested in hiring, without ever needing to make their task or research public. </li></ul></ul><h2>Why this is a good idea</h2><ul><li><strong>A marketplace is a really standard thing,</strong> people already have models and expectations for how they work and how to interact with them. In this case, it’s just a marketplace for a particular kind of thing, otherwise the mechanics are what people are used to. Say “TaskRabbit for research/intellectual labor” and I bet people will get it.</li><ul><li>Also marketplace and working for money is more probably the right genre for working hard for several days and deterministically getting paid. The thing about Q&amp;A is that it’s somewhat trying to get people to do serious work via something which looks a lot like the things they do recreationally.</li></ul><li><strong>It reduces uncertainty around payment/incentives.</strong> The two parties negotiate a contract (perhaps payment happens via LW) and the worker knows that they will get paid as much as in any real job they might be hired for.</li><li><strong>It solves the trust thing.</strong> 1) The hirers get to select who they trust with their research questions, it’s not open to anyone. The profiles are helpful for this, as a careful hirer can carefully go through someone’s qualification and past work to see if they trust them.</li><ul><li>LessWrong could even create a “pipeline” of skill around the marketplace for intellectual labor. People start with simple, low-trust tasks and as they prove themselves and get good reviews, they’re more attractive.</li></ul><li><strong>It addresses privacy. </strong>You might not be willing to place your research questions on the public internet, but you might be willing them to trust a carefully vetted single person who you hire.</li><li><strong>It addresses the two-sided marketplace challenge. </strong>The format allows you to build each side somewhat asynchronously.</li><ul><li>Find a few people and convince them to create a few work tasks they’d like done but aren’t urgent (approximately questions). Once they’re up there, you can say “yes, we’ve got some tasks that Paul Christiano would like answers on”</li><li>Find people who would be interested in the right kind of work, get them to create profiles. They don’t have to commit to doing any particular work, they’re just there in case someone else wants to reach out to hire them. (One could imagine making it behave like Reciprocity.)</li></ul><li><strong>It lets you hire for things like tutoring.</strong></li><ul><li>Eli mentioned how much he values 1:1 interaction and tutoring. When he’s got a confusion, he seeks a tutor. That’s not something Q&amp;A really supports, but a marketplace for intellectual labor could.</li><li>It could be an efficient way for people looking for knowledge from an expert to be able to find one who is available and at the right price.</li><ul><li>I’ve seen spreadsheets over the years of EA’s registering their names, interests, and skills. I don’t know if people ever used them, but it does seem neat if there was just a locked-in service which was directory of experts on various topics that you could pay to access.</li></ul></ul><li><strong>[Added] It diversifies the range of work you can hire for.</strong></li><ul><li>It seems good if people doing research work can hire people to format latex, proofread, edit, and generally handle tasks which frees them up to more core research.</li></ul><li><strong>[Added] </strong>It doesn’t limit the medium of the work to being the LessWrong platform. Once an arrangement is made, the hirer and worker are free to work in person, work via Google Doc, Skype, or whatever else is most convenient and native to their work. In contrast, Q&amp;A makes the format UI experience of the platform a bottleneck on communication of research.</li><ul><li>Needing to write up results formally in a way that is suitable for the public is also a costly step that is avoided in 1-to-1 work arrangement.</li><li>It does seem that CKeditor could dovetail really nice with collaboration via the marketplace, assuming otherwise people are using Google Docs. Once the research content is already on LW, we can streamline the process of making it public.</li><ul><li>Research being conducted in Google docs and then polished and share might be a much more natural flow than needing people to conduct research in whatever tools and then translate it into the format of comments/answers.</li><ul><li>Another idea: building in things like citation management and other stuff to the LW Google Doc’s and building a generally great research</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><p>You could build up several dozen or hundred worker (laborer?) profiles before you approach highly acclaimed researchers and say “hey, we’ve got a list of people willing to offer intellectual labor”, interested in taking a look? Or “we’ve got tasks from X, Y, Z - would you like to look and see if you can help?” </p><p>[redacted]: “I’d help [highly respected person] with pretty much whatever.” Right now [highly respected person] has no easy way to reach out to people who might be able to do work for them. I’m sure X and Y [redacted] wouldn&#x27;t mind a better way for people to locate their services.</p><p>In the earlier stages, LessWrong could do a bit of matchmaking. Using our knowledge and connections to link up suitable people to tasks. </p><p>Existing services like this (where the platform is kind of a matchmaker) such as TaskRabbit and Handy struggle because people use the platform initially to find someone, e.g. a house cleaner, but then bypass the middleman to book subsequent services. But we’re not trying to make money off of this, we don’t need to be in the middle. If a task happens because of the LW marketplace and then two people have an ongoing work relationship - that is fantastic.</p><h2>Crazy places where this leads</h2><p>You could imagine this ending up with LessWrong playing the role of some meta-hirer/recruiting agency type thing. People create profiles, upload all kinds of info, get interviewed - and then they are rated and ranked within the system. They then get matched with suitable tasks. Possibly only 5-10% of the entire pool ever gets work, but it’s more surface area on the hiring problem within EA. </p><p>80k might offer career advice, but they’re not a recruiting agency and they don’t place people.</p><h2>Why it might not be that great (uncertainties)</h2><p>It might turn out that all the challenges of hiring people generally apply when hiring just for more limited tasks, e.g. trusting them to do a good job. If it’s too much hassle to vet all the profiles vying to work on your task, learn how to interact with a new person around research, etc., then people won’t do it.</p><p>If it turns out that it is really hard to discretize intellectual work, then a marketplace idea is going to face the same challenges as Q&amp;A. Both would require some solution of the same kind.</p><p>I’m sure there’s a lot more to go here. I’ve only spent a couple of hours thinking about this as of 3/17.</p><h2>Q&amp;A + Marketplace: Synergy</h2><p>I think there could be some good synergies. Ways in which each blend into each other and support each other. Something I can imagine is that there’s a “discount” on intellectual labor hired if those engaged in the work allow it to be made public on LW. The work done through the marketplace gets “imported” as a Q&amp;A where further people can come along and comment and provide feedback.</p><p>Or someone is answering your question and like what they’ve said, but you want more. You could issue an “invite” to hire them them to work more on your task. Here you’d get the benefits of a publicly posted question anyone can work plus the benefits of a dedicated person you’re paying and working closely with. This person, if they become an expert in the topic, could even begin managing the question thread freeing up the important person who asked the question to begin with.</p><h1>8.

<p>In my <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Y2LhX3925RodndwpC/resolving-human-values-completely-and-adequately"">initial post</a> on synthesising human preferences, I imagined a linear combination of <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CiB3myyeEhFRgmKPL/partial-preferences-and-models"">partial preferences</a>. Later, when talking about <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/MxLK2fvEuijAYgsc2/smoothmin-and-personal-identity"">identity preferences</a>, I proposed a smoothmin instead (which can also be seen as strong diminishing returns to any one partial preference).</p>
<p>I was trying to formalise how humans seem to trade-off their various preferences in different circumstances. However the ideal is not to <em>a priori</em> decide how humans are trading off the preferences, but instead to copy how humans actually do trade off the preferences.</p>
<p>To do that, we need to imagine the human in situations quite distant from their current ones - situations where some of their partial preferences are more or less fulfilled. This brings up the problem of <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/WAmpz8Z4FZ4FbCNtR/models-of-preferences-in-distant-situations"">modelling preferences in distant situations</a>. Assuming some acceptable resolution to that problem, the AI would have an exchange rate between different preferences, in different situations and with different levels of preference fulfilment.</p>
<p>Meta-preferences may constrain the preferences in very distant situations. Most paradoxes of  population ethics are in situations very different from today, so population ethics preferences can be seen in this way. Universal moral principles act in a similar way, giving limits on what can happen in all situations, including extreme ones - though note there are arguments to <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/WAmpz8Z4FZ4FbCNtR/models-of-preferences-in-distant-situations"">avoid some unusual situations entirely</a>.</p>
<p>Then the AI's task is to come up with a general formula for the exchange rate between different preferences, that extends to all situations and respects the constraints of the meta-preferences. It will probably smooth out quite a bit of ""noise"" in the exchange rates between different preferences, while respecting the general trends.</p>

<li>""I ache for the day when I am in heaven singing the praise of God"".</li>
</ul>
<p>That's a preference that many religious believers have. Not being religious myself, I don't have it, and even find it factually wrong - but how can a preference be wrong?</p>
<p>Here's a preference I do have:</p>
<ul>
<li>""I ache for a world where people spontaneously help each other overcome their problems"".</li>
</ul>
<p>That preferences is also ""wrong"", in a similar sense. Let's see how.</p>
<h1>Decomposing partially erroneous variables</h1>
<p><em>For the purpose of this post, I am assuming atheism, which is the position I myself hold; for those of a religious disposition, it may help to assume that ""God"" refers here to a non-existent god from a different, wrong, religion.</em></p>
<p>Now, the ""praising God"" preference could be decomposed into other, simpler variables. It may <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yA4gF5KrboK2m2Xu7/how-an-algorithm-feels-from-inside"">feel like it's a single node</a>, but it is likely composed of many different preferences linked together:</p>
<p><img src=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/5fg73w0qhrtb8zt/praise_god.PNG?raw=1"" alt=""""></p>
<p>So, for example, those with that preference might think it good to be humble, feel there's something intrinsically valuable about holiness, enjoy the ecstatic feeling they get when praising God in a religious context, and feel that one should praise God out of a feeling of gratitude. We can consider that these form four of the foreground variables that the believer ""cares about"" <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CiB3myyeEhFRgmKPL/partial-preferences-and-models"">in their partial model</a> (what about the fifth node? We'll get back to that).</p>
<p>Note that the human didn't necessarily use a partial model with these four variables; they may instead have just a single variable entitled ""praise god in heaven"". However, we're decomposing the partially erroneous variable (since God doesn't exist), using the believer's <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ix3KdfJxjo9GQFkCo/web-of-connotations-bleggs-rubes-thermostats-and-beliefs"">web of connotation</a>, into simpler variables.</p>
<h1>Erroneous foreground variables</h1>
<p>There's nothing wrong with the humbleness and ecstatic preferences. The gratitude node is problematic, because there ain't any God. If the believer only feels gratitude to God, then we can just erase that node as an error. However, it's possible that they might feel general gratitude towards their superiors, or towards their parents/mentors/those who've made them who they are. In that case, the preference for ""Gratitude to God"" is simply a special case of a very valid preference applied to an erroneous situation.</p>
<p>Then we have the interesting preference for ""holiness"". Holiness is not a well-grounded variable, but has its own <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ix3KdfJxjo9GQFkCo/web-of-connotations-bleggs-rubes-thermostats-and-beliefs"">web of connotation</a>, maybe consisting of religious rituals, feelings of transcendence, spiritual experiences, and so on. Further splitting the node could allow us to home in on more precise preferences.</p>
<h2>Affective spirals and subjective experience</h2>
<p>There is a problem with decomposing complex variables into components: <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/XrzQW69HpidzvBxGr/affective-death-spirals"">affective death spirals</a> / <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_effect"">halo effects</a>. ""Holiness"" probably has a huge amount of positive connotations, as compared to the variables it could be decomposed into.</p>
<p>I'd tend to favour using the decomposed variables as the main indicator of preference. We can still use the halo-ed top variable for some components of human experience; for example, we might assume that the believer here really <em>enjoys the subjective experience of holiness</em>, even if that preference over the outside world is not as strong.</p>
<h1>Erroneous values for background variables</h1>
<p>What of the last node? Well, as Mark Twain pointed out,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Singing hymns and waving palm branches through all eternity is pretty when you hear about it in the pulpit, but it's as poor a way to put in valuable time as a body could contrive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This brings us to the last node: no humans alive today is capable of spending their lives praising, nor would they enjoy the experience much, after the first few minutes or hours. Believers presumably don't think of themselves in heaven as mindless zombies; I'm going to assume that this hypothetical believer might imagine that the mere presence of God will transform their desires in such a way that makes praising a desirable activity for them.</p>
<p>Even if that is the case, it still means putting the believer in a situation where most aspects of their identity are irrelevant or overwritten. Their sexual preferences, favourite movies and computer games, favourite sporting events, sense of humour, quirks of personality, etc... all become irrelevant. Therefore, despite the believer's beliefs, they are contemplating a partial model in which the <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CiB3myyeEhFRgmKPL/partial-preferences-and-models"">background variables</a> are very different, even though the believer does not realise this difference (see <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/WAmpz8Z4FZ4FbCNtR/models-of-preferences-in-distant-situations"">here</a> for another example of preference where one of the variables is wrong).</p>
<p>This is the main way in which the ""praise God"" preference is erroneous: it involves huge changes to their identity and preferences, but they are not aware of this in their partial models.</p>
<h1>Spontaneous help decomposition</h1>
<p>My ""spontaneous help"" preference can probably be decomposed in a similar fashion:</p>
<p><img src=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/i4vef6lio50myf6/help_others.PNG?raw=1"" alt=""""></p>
<p>This has a ""same identity"" problem, just as the ""praise God"" has, but it's milder: people cooperate far more often than they sing praises for days on end. The bigger problem is the implicit assumption that when people do things for other people, this automatically has the same efficiency as markets or other more selfish coordination mechanisms. People helping each other is not supposed to leave people worse off.</p>
<p>If I was aware of that flaw AND still had that preference (which I mildly do, in practice), then I would have a non-wrong preference. Which doesn't mean that you have to agree with me, for you have your own preferences, but means that my preference is no longer ""wrong"" in the sense of this post: ""Same efficiency"" becomes the foreground variable ""Efficiency"", one that is actually negatively activated in this model, but not enough to overcome the positive activation of the other variables:</p>

<p>For <strong>X</strong>, consider three different <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CiB3myyeEhFRgmKPL/partial-preferences-and-models"">partial preferences</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>If <strong>X</strong> were poor, they would prioritise consumption over saving.</li>
<li><strong>X</strong>: If I were poor, I would prioritise saving over consumption.</li>
<li><strong>X</strong>: If I were poor, I'd get my personal accountant to advise me on the best saving/consumption plan for poor people.</li>
</ol>
<p>1 is what <strong>X</strong>'s judgement would be in a different, distant situation. 2 is what <strong>X</strong>'s <em>current</em> judgement about what their judgement would be in that situation. 3 is similar, but is based on a factually wrong model of what that distant situation is.</p>
<p>So what are we to make of these in terms of <strong>X</strong>'s preferences? 3 can be discounted as factually incorrect. 2 is a correct interpretation of <strong>X</strong>'s current (meta-)preferences over that distant situation, but we know that these will change if they actually reach that situation. It might be tempting to see 1 as the genuine preference, but that's tricky. It's a preference that <strong>X</strong> doesn't have, and may never have. Even if <strong>X</strong> were certain to end up poor, their preference may depend on the path that they took to get there - medical bankruptcy, alcoholism, or one dubious investment, could result in different preferences. And that's without considering the different ways the AI could put <strong>X</strong> in that situation - we don't want the AI to <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5bd75cc58225bf06703752aa/uninfluenceable-agents"">influence its own learning process</a> by indirectly determining the preferences it will maximise.</p>
<p>So, essentially, using 1 is a problem because the preference is <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/i6hWWcKyxBPj7ELT6/one-step-hypothetical-preferences"">many steps removed</a> and can be influenced by the AI (though that last issue <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5bd75cc58225bf067037536b/counterfactually-uninfluenceable-agents"">may have solutions</a>). Using 2 is a problem because the current (meta-)preferences are projected into a situation where they would be wrong. This can end up with someone railing against the preferences of their past self, even if those preferences now constrain them. This is, in essence, a partial version of the Gödel-like problem <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Y2LhX3925RodndwpC/resolving-human-values-completely-and-adequately"">mentioned her</a>, where the human rebels against the preferences the AI has determined them to have.</p>
<p>So, what is the best way of figuring out <strong>X</strong>'s ""true"" preferences? This is one of the things that we expect the system to be robust to. Whether type 1 or type 2 preferences are prioritised, the synthesis should still reach an acceptable outcome. And the rebellion against the synthesised values is a general problem with these methods, and should be solved in some way or another - possibly by the human agreeing to <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4H8N3fEfXQmzxSaRo/upcoming-stability-of-values"">freeze their preferences</a> under the partial guidance of the AI.</p>
<h2>Avoid ambiguous distant situation</h2>
<p>If the synthesis of <strong>X</strong>'s preferences in situation S is ambiguous, that might be an argument to avoid situation S entirely. For example, suppose S involves very lossy uploads of current humans, so that the uploads seem pretty similar to the original human but not identical. Rather than sorting out whether or not human preferences apply here, it might be best to reason ""there is a chance that human flourishing has been lost entirely here, so we shouldn't pay too much attention to what human preferences actually are in S, and just avoid S entirely"".</p>
<p>Note that this means avoiding morally ambiguous distant situations, not distant situations per se. Worlds with voluntary human slaves may be worth avoiding, while worlds with spaceships, uploads, but same-as-now morality, are basically just ""today's world - with lasers!"" and are not morally ambiguous.</p>

Translation by Épiphanie.</p>
<p>Trigger warning: Death, suicide, and murder. Trolley problem.</p>
<p>This is quite the conventional and ethical conundrum: You are near train tracks, and a train is rolling down the hill. It is going to run over 4 people who are tied to the rails of the main track. However, you can change the train's direction to a secondary track by pulling a lever; so that it runs over only one guy, also tied down the rails. Should you pull the lever?</p>
<p>I do believe there is a more interesting way to frame it: What would you choose if you are yourself tied to the rails, alone, while the train is not heading toward you yet. My own answer is very simple: I want the person deciding where the train should go to have <em>no doubts</em> they should pull the lever! Because, for lack of context, I assume that the other four people are just me, or rather copies of me. That's a bit simplistic, of course they are not perfect clone. But as far as concrete predicates go, they are indistinguishable. That is to say I have odds of being on tracks alone of 1 in 5, and odds for being in the group of 4 in 5.
And tell you what, I prefer dying with 20% probability because of what someone did, rather than to die with 80% probability because no one was ever willing to take the burden of responsibility.</p>
<p>I know many would not pull the lever, or at least be very reluctant to. That is precisely the reason I am writing this post: I wish to make it public that I believe people should pull the lever. More importantly, I wish that many many more people would also share publicly this opinion. Then, if it is of public notoriety, the one who has to pull the lever would know they can do it without any remorse, as they will not have to face any societal consequences for what they've done. So all in all, this would raise my odds of survival of 60 points! That's quite something</p>
<h2>But what if it were to truly happen?</h2>
<p>Be aware that I am not saying anything more than what I have literally written. I have full rights over inconsistencies. Were I to be on the tracks alone, there is no telling what I would do. Maybe I would cry and plead not to pull the lever, maybe I would depict the other four people as worse than Hitler, or I would indulge the person into thinking they'd bear the burden of my death. Once I know that the probability of me dying jumps from 20 to 100%, I would -I presume- fight hard for my survival. Similarly, if I am on the tracks all alone, and I am the one who has to decide where the train should go, I am not plaging at all I would pull the lever.</p>
<p>Or maybe I will. Maybe I will be consistent. Right now, up there in my apartment where the worst thing I can think of to happen is my contract not being renewed, I cannot begin to imagine what it would be like. I can say what I hope for: I wish to be consistent in this situation... It would be extremely unfair and pointless to have another person bear my death on their own hands along the guilt that goes with it.</p>
<p>I see however only one problem to this policy. If this situation were to to be iterated frequently enough such that there is a selection mechanism among the survivors' behavior, then eventually the altruists would dwindle out in favor of egoists. So I am going to be optimistic and assume in this post that this trolley situation happens only in an exceptional fashion.</p>
<h2>Assumptions</h2>
<p>As with many such similar problems, it seems to me that one of the main flaw of the question is in everything that is not said. Everything that makes up the problem in itself, even, is ignored in favor of something so theoretic that it turns the problem so abstract it has no solutions at all.</p>
<p>For instance, one of the important assumption for this problem is the one that people are chosen at random. Let us break this assumption: For instance, suppose the villain of this story has awaited knowing everyone's opinion before unfolding their scheme. The villain tie people of the opinion ""do not change the train's direction"" on the main track and on the second track, people of the opinion ""change the train's direction"". Then I would be on the secondary track, and if one were to listen to me, I would die. Yet I could have survived had I just thought like everyone ""don't pull the lever"".
When depicting this situation, I realise there is something very paradoxical about it. But what I'm really interested in, is that by removing the hypothesis of randomness, the 20/80% ratio does not hold anymore. That is what I am a bit anxious about when writing this post. I wary it becomes fuel in favor of killing people having the same position as I do, while changing nothing for others.</p>
<p>Another assumption I did not take into account thus far: Who are the people tied to the rails? If the train kills me, and the 4 others are worse-than-Hitler people, I would be a bit embarrassed (and dead). Theoretically, if I were tied alone and the other group contains Hitler along with few other dictators, I would still like to be saved.
Note that I am against the death penalty, no exceptions and in favor of a just trial for anyone, no exceptions. My question is different however, and I still am pondering over what answer would be mine. I have no intentions for my life to be sacrificed for that of some tyrants. But I have also no intentions to be the kind of person that says their life is better than that of four others', let alone that it can be decided in few mere seconds.</p>
<p>The last assumption that has been ignored is how did we get here in the first place. I mean, it's not your mundane day-to-day situation! And this question is important even more so if we want to avoid it happening once more. The villain scenario is rather far-fetched, it seems this kind of situation can happen in real life, where technical decisions have to be taken fast. It can be, for instance, whether to choose between one pedestrian and a car full of passengers. Or between 4 pedestrians and a car with only one passenger. Or one worker working on the rails versus several working together. And so on and so on...</p>
<p>Let's be even more cynical: imagine an accident in a company which may kill four managers (by destroying their office)m and you can prevent that by killing a single workperson instead.  If people follow the policy and ""always pull the lever"", none of the managers would have any real and strong incentive to ensure that this kind of incident does not occur anymore. They are always being saved and workpeople are being killed one by one. If this incident ks going to occur five times or more, not pulling the switch at all may actually save more lives in the long run. Once again, I am not necessarily asking for you to pull the lever in this kind of situation.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This post is just long for ""I am taking a very strong precommitment for a situation whose assumptions are so strong themselves that I cannot fathom they would ever hold"".
Still, I was about to write a post on Atlas Shrugged (spoilers:) and I foresaw I would have to explain why I'd never swear in good faith that ""by my life and my love of it, [...] I will never live for the sake of another man, nor ask another man to live for mine.”</p>

This post uses a premise of continuous AI development and broad AI deployment and depicts two other stories of AI catastrophe that Paul finds more realistic.</p><p>The first story is rooted in the fact that AI systems have a huge comparative advantage at optimizing for easily measured goals. We already see problems with humans optimizing for the easily measured goals (scientific malpractice, outrage-inducing social media, etc.) and with AI these problems will be severely exacerbated. So far, we have been able to use human reasoning to ameliorate these problems, by changing incentives, enacting laws, or using common sense to interpret goals correctly. We will initially be able to use human reasoning to create good proxies, but over time as AI systems become more capable our ability to do this will lag further and further behind. We end up &quot;going out with a whimper&quot;: ultimately our values are no longer shaping society&#x27;s trajectory.</p><p>The second story starts out like the first story, but adds in a new complication: the AI system could develop internal goals of its own. AI performs a huge search over policies for ones that score well on the training objective. Unfortunately, a policy that optimizes for the goal of &quot;having influence&quot; will initially score well on most training objectives: when you don&#x27;t already have influence, a good strategy for gaining influence is to do what your overseers want you to do. (Here &quot;influence&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean just social influence; control over nukes also counts as influence.) At some point the system will be powerful enough that gaining influence no longer means doing what the overseers want. We will probably know about this dynamic through some catastrophic AI failures (e.g. an AI-run corporation stealing the money it manages), but may not be able to do anything about it because we would be extremely reliant on AI systems. Eventually, during some period of heightened vulnerability, one AI system may do something catastrophic, leading to a distribution shift which triggers a cascade of other AI systems (and human systems) failing, leading to an unrecoverable catastrophe (think something in the class of a hostile robot takeover). Note that &quot;failure&quot; here means an AI system &quot;intentionally&quot; doing something that we don&#x27;t want, as opposed to the AI system not knowing what to do because it is not robust to distributional shift.</p><p><strong>Rohin&#x27;s opinion:</strong> Note that Paul thinks these scenarios are more realistic because he expects that many of the other problems (e.g. wireheading, giving AI systems an objective such that it doesn&#x27;t kill humans) will be solved by default. I somewhat expect even the first story to be solved by default -- it seems to rest on a premise of human reasoning staying as powerful as it is right now, but it seems plausible that as AI systems grow in capability we will be able to leverage them to improve human reasoning (think of how paper or the Internet amplified human reasoning). The second story seems much more difficult -- I don&#x27;t see any clear way that we can avoid influence-seeking behavior. It is currently my most likely scenario for an AI catastrophe that was a result of a failure of technical AI safety (or more specifically, <u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/ZeE7EKHTFMBs8eMxn/clarifying-ai-alignment"">intent alignment</a></u> (<u><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/b6dc636f6a1b/alignment-newsletter-33"">AN #33</a></u>)).</p><p><strong>Read more:</strong> <u><a href=""https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/3/26/18281297/ai-artificial-intelligence-safety-disaster-scenarios"">AI disaster won’t look like the Terminator. It’ll be creepier.</a></u></p><p><strong><u><a href=""https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/openai-askell-brundage-clark-latest-in-ai-policy-and-strategy/"">80K podcast: How can policy keep up with AI advances?</a></u></strong> <em>(Rob Wiblin, Jack Clark, Miles Brundage and Amanda Askell)</em>: OpenAI policy researchers Jack Clark, Amanda Askell and Miles Brundage cover a large variety of topics relevant to AI policy, giving an outside-view perspective on the field as a whole. A year or two ago, the consensus was that the field required <u><a href=""https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/RCvetzfDnBNFX7pLH/personal-thoughts-on-careers-in-ai-policy-and-strategy"">disentanglement research</a></u>; now, while disentanglement research is still needed, there are more clearly defined important questions that can be tackled independently. People are now also taking action in addition to doing research, mainly by accurately conveying relevant concepts to policymakers. A common thread across policy is the framing of the problem as a large coordination problem, for which an important ingredient of the solution is to build <em>trust</em> between actors.</p><p>Another thread was the high uncertainty over specific details of scenarios in the future, but the emergence of some structural properties that allow us to make progress anyway. This implies that the goal of AI policy should be aiming for <em>robustness</em> rather than <em>optimality</em>. Some examples:</p><ul><li>The <u><a href=""https://maliciousaireport.com/"">malicious use of AI report</a></u> was broad and high level because each individual example is different and the correct solution depends on the details; a general rule will not work. In fact, Miles thinks that they probably overemphasized how much they could learn from other fields in that report, since the different context means that you quickly hit diminishing returns on what you can learn.</li><li>None of them were willing to predict specific capabilities over more than a 3-year period, especially due to the steep growth rate of compute, which means that things will change rapidly. Nonetheless, there are structural properties that we can be confident will be important: for example, a trained AI system will be easy to scale via copying (which you can&#x27;t do with humans).</li><li>OpenAI&#x27;s strategy is to unify the fields of capabilities, safety and policy, since ultimately these are all facets of the overarching goal of developing beneficial AI. They aim to either be the main actor developing beneficial AGI, or to help the main actor, in order to be robust to many different scenarios.</li><li>Due to uncertainty, OpenAI tries to have policy institutions that make sense over many different time horizons. They are building towards a world with formal processes for coordinating between different AI labs, but use informal relationships and networking for now.</li></ul><p>AI policy is often considered a field where it is easy to cause harm. They identify two (of many) ways this could happen: first, you could cause other actors to start racing (which you may not even realize, if it manifests as a substantial increase in some classified budget), and second, you could build coordination mechanisms that aren&#x27;t the ones people want and that work fine for small problems but break once they are put under a lot of stress. Another common one people think about is information hazards. While they consider info hazards all the time, they also think that (within the AI safety community) these worries are overblown. Typically people overestimate how important or controversial their opinion is. Another common reason for not publishing is not being sure whether the work meets high intellectual standards, but in this case the conversation will be dominated by people with lower standards.</p><p>Miscellaneous other stuff:</p><ul><li>Many aspects of races can make them much more collaborative, and it is not clear that AI corresponds to an adversarial race. In particular, large shared benefits make races much more collaborative.</li><li>Another common framing is to treat the military as an adversary, and try to prevent them from gaining access to AI. Jack thinks this is mistaken, since then the military will probably end up developing AI systems anyway, and you wouldn&#x27;t have been able to help them make it safe.</li><li>There&#x27;s also a lot of content at the end about career trajectories and working at OpenAI or the US government, which I won&#x27;t get into here.</li></ul><p><strong>Rohin&#x27;s opinion:</strong> It does seem like building trust between actors is a pretty key part of AI policy. That said, there are two kinds of trust that you can have: first, trust that the statements made by other actors are true, and second, trust that other actors are aligned enough with you in their goals that their success is also your success. The former can be improved by mechanisms lie monitoring, software verification, etc. while the latter cannot. The former is often maintained using processes that impose a lot of overhead, while the latter usually does not require much overhead once established. The former can scale to large groups comprising thousands or millions of people, while the latter is much harder to scale. I think it&#x27;s an open question in AI policy to what extent we need each of these kinds of trust to exist between actors. This podcast seems to focus particularly on the latter kind.</p><p>Other miscellaneous thoughts:</p><ul><li>I think a lot of these views are conditioned on a gradual view of AI development, where there isn&#x27;t a discontinuous jump in capabilities, and there are many different actors all deploying powerful AI systems.</li><li>Conditional on the military eventually developing AI systems, it seems worth it to work with them to make their AI systems safer. However, it&#x27;s not inconceivable that AI researchers could globally coordinate to prevent military AI applications. This wouldn&#x27;t prevent it from happening eventually, but could drastically slow it down, and let defense scale faster than offense. In that case, working with the military can also be seen as a defection in a giant coordination game with other AI researchers.</li><li>One of my favorite lines: &quot;I would recommend everyone who has calibrated intuitions about AI timelines spend some time doing stuff with real robots and it will probably … how should I put this? … further calibrate your intuitions in quite a humbling way.&quot; (Not that I&#x27;ve worked with real robots, but many of my peers have.)</li></ul><h1><strong>Technical AI alignment</strong></h1><h3><strong>Problems</strong></h3><p><strong><u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/HBxe6wdjxK239zajf/more-realistic-tales-of-doom"">More realistic tales of doom</a></u></strong> <em>(Paul Christiano)</em>: Summarized in the highlights!</p><p><u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/WXvt8bxYnwBYpy9oT/the-main-sources-of-ai-risk"">The Main Sources of AI Risk?</a></u> <em>(Wei Dai)</em>: This post lists different causes or sources of existential risk from advanced AI.</p><h3><strong>Technical agendas and prioritization</strong></h3><p><u><a href=""https://medium.com/@catherio/unsolved-research-problems-vs-real-world-threat-models-e270e256bc9e"">Unsolved research problems vs. real-world threat models</a></u> <em>(Catherine Olsson)</em>: Papers on adversarial examples often suggest that adversarial examples can lead to real world problems as their motivation. As we&#x27;ve <u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.06732"">seen</a></u> (<u><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/4b19d2caa5a9/alignment-newsletter-19"">AN #19</a></u>) <u><a href=""https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/09/introducing-unrestricted-adversarial.html"">previously</a></u> (<u><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/d7b5059d64ed/alignment-newsletter-24"">AN #24</a></u>), many adversarial example settings are not very realistic <em>threat models</em> for any real world problem. For example, adversarial &quot;stickers&quot; that cause vision models to fail to recognize stop signs could cause an autonomous vehicle to crash... but an adversary could also just knock over the stop sign if that was their goal.</p><p>There are more compelling reasons that we might care about imperceptible perturbation adversarial examples. First, they are a proof of concept, demonstrating that our ML models are not robust and make &quot;obvious&quot; mistakes and so cannot be relied on. Second, they form an unsolved research problem, in which progress can be made more easily than in real settings, because it can be formalized straightforwardly (unlike realistic settings). As progress is made in this toy domain, it can be used to inform new paradigms that are closer to realistic settings. But it is <em>not</em> meant to mimic real world settings -- in the real world, you need a threat model of what problems can arise from the outside world, which will likely suggest much more basic concerns than the &quot;research problems&quot;, requiring solutions involving sweeping design changes rather than small fixes.</p><p><strong>Rohin&#x27;s opinion:</strong> I strongly agree with the points made in this post. I don&#x27;t know to what extent researchers themselves agree with this point -- it seems like there is <em>a lot</em> of adversarial examples research that is looking at the imperceptible perturbation case and many papers that talk about new types of adversarial examples, without really explaining why they are doing this or giving a motivation that is about unsolved research problems rather than real world settings. It&#x27;s possible that researchers do think of it as a research problem and not a real world problem, but present their papers differently because they think that&#x27;s necessary in order to be accepted.</p><p>The distinction between research problems and real world threat models seem to parallel the distinction between theoretical or conceptual research and engineering in AI safety. The former typically asks questions of the form &quot;how could we do this in principle, making simplifying assumptions X, Y and Z&quot;, even though X, Y and Z are known not to hold in the real world, for the sake of having greater conceptual clarity that can later be leveraged as a solution to a real world problem. Engineering work on the other hand is typically trying to scale an approach to a more complex environment (with the eventual goal of getting to a real world problem).</p><h3><strong>Learning human intent</strong></h3><p><u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03877"">Literal or Pedagogic Human? Analyzing Human Model Misspecification in Objective Learning</a></u> <em>(Smitha Milli et al)</em>: In <u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03137"">Cooperative Inverse Reinforcement Learning</a></u>, we assume a two-player game with a human and a robot where the robot doesn&#x27;t know the reward R, but both players are trying to maximize the reward. Since one of the players is a human, we cannot simply compute the optimal strategy and deploy it -- we are always making some assumption about the human, that may be misspecified. A common assumption is that the human is playing optimally for the single-player version of the game, also known as a literal human. The robot then takes the best response actions given that assumption. Another assumption is to have a <em>pedagogic</em> human, who acts as though the robot is interpreting her literally. The robot that takes the best response actions with this assumption is called a pedagogic or pragmatic robot.</p><p>However, any assumption we make about the human is going to be misspecified. This paper looks at how we can be robust to misspecification, in particular if the human could be literal or pedagogic. The main result is that the literal robot is more robust to misspecification. The way I think about this is that the literal robot is designed to work with a literal human, and a pedagogic human is &quot;designed&quot; to work with the literal robot, so unsurprisingly the literal robot works well with both of them. On the other hand, the pedagogic robot is designed to work with the pedagogic human, but has no relationship with the literal robot, and so should not be expected to work well. It turns out we can turn this argument into a very simple proof: (literal robot, pedagogic human) outperforms (literal robot, literal human) since the pedagogic human is designed to work well with the literal robot, and (literal robot, literal human) outperforms (pedagogic robot, literal human) since the literal robot is designed to work with the literal human.</p><p>They then check that the theory holds in practice. They find that the literal robot is better than the pedagogic robot <em>even when humans are trying to be pedagogic</em>, a stronger result than the theory predicted. The authors hypothesize that even when trying to be pedagogic, humans are more accurately modeled as a mixture of literal and pedagogic humans, and the extra robustness of the literal robot means that it is the better choice.</p><p><strong>Rohin&#x27;s opinion:</strong> I found this theorem quite unintuitive when I first encountered it, despite it being two lines long, which is something of a testament to how annoying and tricky misspecification can be. One way I interpret the empirical result is that the wider the probability distributions of our assumptions, the more robust they are to misspecification. A literal robot assumes that the human can take any near-optimal trajectory, whereas a pedagogic robot assumes that the human takes very particular near-optimal trajectories that best communicate the reward. So, the literal robot places probability mass over a larger space of trajectories given a particular reward, and does not update as strongly on any particular observed trajectory compared to the pedagogic robot, making it more robust.</p><h3><strong>Interpretability</strong></h3><p><u><a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.05806"">SVCCA: Singular Vector Canonical Correlation Analysis for Deep Learning Dynamics and Interpretability</a></u> <em>(Maithra Raghu et al)</em></p><h3><strong>Robustness</strong></h3><p><u><a href=""https://sites.google.com/view/udlworkshop2019/"">Call for Papers: ICML 2019 Workshop on Uncertainty and Robustness in Deep Learning</a></u> (summarized by Dan H): Topics of this workshop include out-of-distribution detection, calibration, robustness to corruptions, robustness to adversaries, etc. Submissions are due April 30th.</p><h1><strong>AI strategy and policy</strong></h1><p><strong><u><a href=""https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/openai-askell-brundage-clark-latest-in-ai-policy-and-strategy/"">80K podcast: How can policy keep up with AI advances?</a></u></strong> <em>(Rob Wiblin, Jack Clark, Miles Brundage and Amanda Askell)</em>: Summarized in the highlights!</p><p><u><a href=""https://www.charlottestix.com/european-union-ai-ecosystem"">A Survey of the EU&#x27;s AI Ecosystem</a></u> <em>(Charlotte Stix)</em>: This report analyzes the European AI ecosystem.

<p>Our universe exists in a 2 dimensional matrix which we call space-time. It consists of a spatial dimension, interlinked with a temporal dimension. The word 'time' is a term describing temporal motion. So we 'move' through the spatial dimension and we 'time' through the temporal dimension.</p>
<p>Motion through the spatial dimension is measured in inches, meters, kilometers, light years, etc. Motion through the temporal dimension is measured in seconds, hours, days, years, etc. The speed at which we time through the temporal dimension is called our temporal velocity.</p>
<p>We only time in one direction. Towards the future. So the future is a temporal location, towards which we 'time'. The past is a temporal location which we have already occupied.</p>
<p>Because the two dimensions are interlinked, our spatial velocity is inversely proportional to our temporal velocity. The faster we move, the slower we time. Timing, however, is not just for humans. Everything in the universe, besides mass less particles, times.</p>
<p>To us it feels as though time is something that passes, but it's like seeing trees pass the window of a moving train. It's our temporal motion which causes the illusion of time passing. You can think of a clock as a temporal odometer. It measures how far we time. So tape measures measure spatial distances and clocks measure temporal distances.</p>
<p>Velocity is the relationship between moving and timing.</p>

General v. specific planning is pretty bad, but at least for the purpose of this post I&#x27;ll stick to it.</p><p>I know they&#x27;ve been discussed here in one form or other, probably many times, but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ve really been explicitly contrasted.  I thought doing that might be useful. </p><p>Here are some suggestive, if imperfect, contrasts, illustrating what I mean.</p><h1><strong>Examples</strong></h1><ul><li>How I try to win Chess versus how Chess grandmasters and AlphaZero try to win Chess.</li><ul><li>I tend to play Chess by trying to get an advantage in valuable pieces, because that is generally useful to me.  I then try to use these pieces to eventually obtain checkmate.</li><li>On the other hand, AlphaZero seems to play to obtain a specific, although gradually accumulated, positional advantage that ultimately results in a resounding victory.  It is happy to sacrifice &quot;generally useful&quot; material to get this.</li><li>This isn&#x27;t simply a matter of just using different techniques to get to the end.  It has more to do with my inability to identify strong positions and picture a game very far into the future.</li></ul><li>Peter Thiel&#x27;s &quot;indefinite optimism&quot; about career success versus &quot;definite optimism&quot; about career success.</li><ul><li>According to this schema, the typical indefinite optimist&#x27;s life-path consists in getting instrumentally useful things, such as education, status, or money, without committing to a definite course of action.  The stereotypical career for such a person is finance or consulting or &quot;business.&quot;  Their success is supposed to follow the pursuit of optionality.</li><li>The definite optimist&#x27;s life path, on the other hand, is more likely to consist in researching and shooting for a single, particular course of action.  The stereotypical career for such a person is as an inventor or entrepreneur.  Their success is supposed to follow after giving up a great deal of optionality.</li><li>The indefinite optimist accumulates generally useful resources, while the definite optimist will give up many &quot;generally useful&quot; things in order to reach a single goal.</li></ul><li>OpenAI&#x27;s strategy versus DeepMind&#x27;s strategy of handling AGI successfully.</li><ul><li>OpenAI seems like it is trying to position itself to be able to influence policy, influence other researchers in other institutions, and perhaps--although probably not--develop AGI itself, and thereby insure safe AGI.  They recently made themselves into a &quot;capped profit&quot; company to gain more money, similarly.</li><li>On the other hand, DeepMind&#x27;s strategy simply seems be to try to develop AGI itself.

You plan to get the means for happiness, not happiness itself.  This turns out badly when the presumed means pin you down and prevent you from getting what you really wanted.</li><li>Red advice, on the other hand, is more about picturing for yourself what you want in your inmost core, and saying to pursue that kind of happiness directly.  You plan to get happiness itself, not the penumbral material for happiness.  This turns out badly when what you thought would make you happy turns out not to make you happy, but now you lack general mobility. </li><li>The former is about pursuing particular things which are often useful for happiness; the latter is about trying to imagine what happiness is for yourself and pursuing that directly.</li><li>(I feel like this is giving short shrift to both perfected white and perfected red ideals, but I think it gets across what I mean.)</li></ul><li>The kind of p<a href=""https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000119312517120198/d373368dex991.htm'="">lanning </a>for success which frequently occurs in startups against the kind of planning which frequently tends to occur in established companies.</li><ul><li>Startups are known for sacrificing instrumentally useful goods -- generally, money -- to carry out a longer-term plan.

No one will fault you for pursuing money, influence, etc.  Many people will think you&#x27;re foolish for deciding to bet your life on a particular path.</li></ul><li>On the other hand, the more specific strategy can be more fun.</li><ul><li>It can be fun because specific planning is more mentally interesting than sort of punting off a strategy to the future by thinking &quot;well, once we&#x27;ve gotten more influence / money / status, then we&#x27;ll pursue X directly.&quot;</li><li>Tighter constraints can be more interesting to work with.  The problem of solving with tighter constraints also exercises your mind more, perhaps.</li><li>(As rather an aside, I think many people only exercise the sort of general planning about life planning, while only exercising the specific about work, which could lead to a little life boredom.  I could be wrong.)</li><li>The more general feels more epistemically humble (potentially in a bad way) while the more specific feels more epistemically interesting (also potentially in a bad way).</li></ul><li>Each strategy is sometimes correct.</li><ul><li>Sometimes you just need to study more math, and sometimes you should actually propose a solution to that RL problem.</li><li>And really this whole framework might be <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/wDP4ZWYLNj7MGXWiW/in-praise-of-fake-frameworks"">fake.</a></li></ul></ul>",,james_t,james_t,james_t

<p>In aiming for an <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Y2LhX3925RodndwpC/resolving-human-values-completely-and-adequately"">adequate synthesis of human preferences</a>, I tend to preserve quirks and even biases of humans, rather than aiming for elegant simplicity as many philosophers do. The main reason is that, <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/GNnHHmm8EzePmKzPk/value-is-fragile"">feeling that value is fragile</a>, I fear losing a valid preference more than allowing an illegitimate bias to get promoted to preference.</p>
<p>But another point is that I don't feel that the cost of excessive complexity is very high.</p>
<h2>The small cost of one-off restrictions</h2>
<p>An analogy could be with government interventions in the market: most naive restrictions will only slightly raise the cost, but will not have a large effect, as the market routes around the restrictions. Consider a government that created price controls on all bread, for some reason. If that was a one-off rule, then we know what would happen: loaves of bread would get gradually smaller, while bakeries would start producing more cake or cake-like products, which now occupy the niche that more expensive bread products would otherwise have filled.</p>
<p>There is likely an efficiency loss here - the balance between cake and bread is different from the market would have given, for small losses to bakers and customers. But these are not huge losses, and they are certainly much smaller than would have happened if the bakers and customers had simply continued as before, except with the price control.</p>
<p>Note that if the government is <em>dynamic</em> with its regulations, then it can impose effective price controls. It could add regulations about bread size, then bread quality, repeatedly; it could apply price controls to cake as well or ban cakes; as the market adjusts, regulations could adjust too. This would impose large efficiency losses (possibly coupled with equity gains, in certain circumstances).</p>
<p>But the cost of one-off restrictions tends to be low.</p>
<h2>Quirks and biases in human preferences</h2>
<p>It seems to me that including quirks and biases in human preferences, is akin to one-off restrictions in the market. Firstly because these quirks will be weighted and balanced against more standard preferences, so would be weaker than ""government regulations"". They would be one-off: quirks and biases tend to be, by definition, less coherent than standard preferences, so they wouldn't be particularly consistent or generalisable, making it easy to ""route around"".</p>
<p>Consider for example how governments deal with these biases today. People tend to be prejudiced against utilitarian calculations for life-and-death issues, and in favour of deontological rules. Yet healthcare systems are very much run on utilitarian lines, sometimes <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_for_Health_and_Care_Excellence"">explicitly</a>, sometimes implicitly. We resolve trolley problems (which most people hate) by ensuring that individuals don't encounter important trolley-like problems in their everyday lives (eg the Hippocratic oath, rules against vigilantism), while larger organisations take trolley-like decisions in bureaucratic ways that shield individuals from the pain of taking any specific decision. In effect, large organisations have become skilled at both respecting and getting around human quirks and biases.</p>
<p>Now, there are a few examples where human biases impose a large cost - such as our obsession with terrorism (and to a lesser extent, crime), or our fear of flying. But, to extend the analogy, governments are far from perfectly efficient, and have their own internal dynamics, blame, and power struggles. An AI dedicated to a) maximising human survival, and b) respecting people's fear of terrorism, would be much more efficient that our current system - providing the most efficient and spectacular uses of security theatre to make people feel safer, while prioritising terrorism deaths over other deaths as little as is compatible with human goals. For example, the AI might be able to diffuse the visceral human response to terrorist attacks, which would deprive them of much of their impact. This resembles the <a href=""https://arbital.com/p/nearest_unblocked/"">nearest unblocked strategy</a> approach: the AI is respecting the bias as little as it needs to.</p>
<p>And, of course, as the AI's power increased, fulfilling quirks and biases will become relatively cheaper to satisfy, as the space of possible strategies opens up. It is <strong>very</strong> hard to design a patch that AIs cannot route around; human quirks and biases are very far from being well-designed patches for this purpose.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This is reasoning by weak analogy, so the issue is worth investigating further. However, at first glance, it seems that the cost of extra complexity in preferences, especially of the quirks and biases types, may be rather low.</p>

kFdSdHmDXcE8f3BXu,Dependability,dependability-1,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/kFdSdHmDXcE8f3BXu/dependability-1,2019-03-26T22:49:37.402Z,75,28,39,False,False,,"<p>I have become very, very interested in developing a skill that I call <strong>Dependability</strong>. </p><p>I believe the skill exists on a spectrum, and you can have less or more of it. It’s not a binary where you either have it or you don’t. </p><p>I believe this skill can be trained on purpose.</p><p>I will briefly describe each attribute that makes up the overall skill.</p><p>( All the examples are made up. Also, assume that the examples are only talking about <em>endorsed</em> actions and goals. )</p><h1>Trying </h1><p><em>To have a vision of a skill or a desirable end state and then be able to strive with deliberate effort towards making that vision a reality. </em></p><p>Ex1: I see a dance routine on YouTube that I think would be awesome if I could perform myself. I’ve never done anything like this before, and I’m somewhat self-conscious or skeptical of how likely I am to succeed. Regardless, I take concrete steps towards learning it (study the video, practice the moves that I see, repeat for many days until I’ve achieved competency at performing the dance). There is some possibility I fail for whatever reason, but this doesn’t stop me from giving it my full effort for at least a week. </p><p>Ex2: There’s a job that I really want. I’m unclear about what steps I need to take to acquire the job, and I’m not sure I’m qualified. I research what kinds of skills and traits are desirable in the job by asking people, Googling, and looking through applications. (I am more encouraged than not by this initial research.) I sign up for workshops and classes that will give me relevant training. I read books. I practice in my free time. I make useful connections / network. I build whatever reputational capital seems useful via blogging, social media, in-person meetings, running events. I apply for the job. If I fail, I figure out what needs work, fix it, and try again until I obtain the position. </p><h1>Commitment</h1><p><em>To form an intention to do something (generally on a longer time scale), be able to say it out loud to someone else, and then be certain it will happen one way or another, barring extreme circumstance. </em></p><p>Ex1: I commit myself via marriage to another person and promise that I will try everything to make the relationship work before giving up on it. I say it out loud as a vow to the other person in a marriage ceremony, in front of a bunch of people. Then I proceed to actually attempt to get as close to 100% chance of creating a permanent relationship situation with this person, using all the tools at my disposal.</p><p>Ex2: I tell someone that I will be there for them in times of emergency or distress, if they ask. I tell them I will make it a priority to me, over whatever else is going on in my life. A year or two later (possibly with very little contact with this person otherwise), they call me and ask for my help. I put everything aside and create a plan to make my way to them and provide my assistance. </p><h1>Follow-through</h1><p><em>To finish projects that you start, to not give up prematurely, to not lose the wind in your sails out of boredom, lack of short-term incentive or immediate reward, lack of encouragement, or feelings of uncertainty and fear. </em></p><p>Here’s an example of what it looks like to NOT have follow-through: I want to write a novel, but every time I start, I lose interest or momentum after initial drafting and planning. Maybe I manage to build the world, create characters, plan out a plot, but then I get to the actual writing, and I fail to write more than a few chapters. Or maybe I loosen the requirements and decide I don’t need to plan everything out in advance, and I just start writing, but I lose steam midway through. I know in my heart that I will never be able to finish it (at least, without some drastic change). </p><p>Having follow-through means having the ability to finish the novel to completion. It is somehow missing from the person I’ve described above. </p><h1>Reliability</h1><p><em>To do what you say you’ll do (on a lesser scale than with commitment); to be where you say you’ll be, when you say you’ll be there; to cooperate proactively, consistently, and predictably with others when you’ve established a cooperative group dynamic. </em></p><p>This can also be summed up as: If you set an expectation in someone else, you don’t do something that would dramatically fail to meet their expectation. You either do the thing or you communicate about it. </p><p>Examples:</p><p>If someone is expecting to meet me at a time and place, I show up at the time and place. If there are delays, I let them know ahead of time. I don’t ever fail to show up AND not tell them in advance AND not explain afterwards (this would count as dramatically failing to meet an expectation).</p><p>If someone asks me to complete a task within the month, and months later, I have both failed to do the task AND I have become incommunicado, this counts as dramatically failing to meet an expectation. </p><p>Note that it doesn’t actually matter if they feel upset by your failure to meet an expectation. They might be totally fine with it. But I still would not have the skill of reliability, by this definition.</p><p>The skill also includes an ability to “plug into” teams and cooperative situations readily. If you are on a team, you are relatively easy to work with. You communicate clearly and proactively. You take responsibility for the tasks that are yours. </p><h1>Focused attention</h1><p><em>To be able set an intention and then keep your attention on something for a set amount of time (maybe about up to 20 minutes). </em></p><p>Ex1: If someone I care about is speaking to me and what they’re saying is important to them, even if it isn’t that important to me, I am able to pay attention, hear their words, and not get lost in my own thoughts such that I can no longer attend to their words. </p><p>Ex2: If I am trying to complete a &lt;20-min task, I do not get distracted by other thoughts. I do not follow every impulse or urge to check Facebook or play a game or get food, such that I cannot complete the task. I’m able to stay focused long enough to finish the task. </p><h1>Being with what is</h1><p><em>To not flinch away from what is difficult, aversive, or painful. To be able to make space for sensations and emotions and thoughts, even if unpleasant. To be able to hold them in your mind without following an automatic reaction to move away or escape. </em></p><p>Ex1: If I am trying to introspect on myself, and I encounter ughy, aversive, or uncomfortable feelings, thoughts, or realizations, I am able to make space for that in my mind and stay with them. (This probably involves distancing myself somewhat from them so that they’re not overwhelming.) </p><p>Ex2: If someone expresses a loud, big, “negative” emotion (anger, fear, sadness, pain), I don’t panic or freeze or dissociate. I can stay calm, embodied, and grounded. And then I stay open to their emotional state and not assume it means something bad about me (“They hate me!” “I’m doing something wrong!” “They don’t want me around!”). I’m not overwhelmed by anxieties or stories about what their emotion means, which might cause me to go away or stop caring about them. I instead make room in myself for my feelings and their feelings so that they can both exist. I maintain an <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/22LAkTNdWv6QaQyZY/active-curiosity-vs-open-curiosity"">open curiosity</a></u> about them. </p><h1>More thoughts on Dependability</h1><p>I claim that all these skills are tied together and related in some important way, and so I bundle them all under the word Dependability. Although I do not myself understand exactly and precisely how they’re related.</p><p>My sense is that the smaller-scale skills (e.g. focused attention, which occurs on a moment-to-moment scale) add to your ability to achieve the larger-scale skills (e.g. commitment, which occurs on a month-to-month scale). </p><p>If I had to point to the <em>core</em> of the Dependability skill and what the foundation of it is, it is based on two things: the ability to set an intention and the ability to stay with what is. And all the above skills apply these two things in some way. </p><p>In general, people seem able to set intentions, but the “staying” is the tricky part. Most people I’ve encountered have some of the Dependability skill, to some extent. But the skill is on a spectrum, and I’d grade most people as “middling.” </p><p>I think I’m personally much <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ykE2WLTdXy5pKD8uK/policy-based-vs-willpower-based-intentions"">worse at setting intentions than average</a></u>. In certain domains (emotions, realizations), I’m above average at staying with what is. In other domains (failure, setbacks, physical discomfort), I’m much, much worse at staying with what is. </p><p>I suspect children are not born with the overall skill. They develop it over time. The <u><a href=""https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Stanford_marshmallow_experiment"">marshmallow test</a></u> seems to assess part of the skill in some way? </p><p>My stereotype of a typical high school or college kid (relative to an adult) is terrible at the overall skill, and especially reliability. I was a prime example. You couldn’t rely on me for anything, and I was really bad at communicating the ways in which I was unreliable. So I just fell through on people a lot, especially people with authority over me. I would make excuses, ask for extensions and exceptions, and drop the ball on things. </p><p>Over time, I learned to do that way less. I’ve drastically improved in reliability, which was helped by having a better self-model, learning my limitations, and then setting expectations more appropriately. I’ve also just obtained more object-level skills such that I can actually do more things. I’ve learned to extend my circle of caring to beyond just myself and my needs, so I can care about the group and its needs.</p><p>The other skills, however, I am still quite bad at. Some of them I’m completely incapable of (commitment, follow-through). </p><h1>How do you train Dependability?</h1><p>I personally feel crippled without the skill. Like I will never achieve my most important goals without it. And also, I feel particularly disabled in gaining the skill, because of how I reacted to childhood trauma. My way of being, so far, has completely avoided making commitments, trying, and having follow-through. I’ve found workarounds for all those things such that I’ve lived my life without having to do them. And I got by just fine, but I won’t be able to achieve many of my goals this way.</p><p>(It’s a blessing and a curse that an intelligent, precocious person can get by without the <em>trying </em>skill, but here we are...)</p><p>Fortunately for me, I currently believe the skill is trainable with deliberate practice. Possibly better in combination with introspective, therapeutic work. </p><p>I don’t know what kind of training would work for others, but for myself, I’ve found one plausible way to train the skill deliberately. </p><p>I spent a week at a place called MAPLE, aka the Monastic Academy for the Preservation of Life on Earth. The people I met there exhibited above average skill in Dependability, and I was notably surprised by it. I was so surprised by it that I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about MAPLE and talking to people about it. And now I’ll be spending a month there as a trial resident, starting in April. </p><p>But this post isn’t where I talk about MAPLE. I mention it primarily as a hint that maybe this skill is attainable through deliberate practice. </p><p>It kind of makes sense that very deliberate, regular meditation could contribute to the skill. Because maybe the micro-skill (setting lots of tiny intentions, being with what is on a moment-to-moment basis) contributes to the macro-skill (setting large intentions, staying with what is on a larger scale). </p><p>The monastic lifestyle also includes being tasked with all kinds of somewhat aversive things (cleaning bathrooms, managing people, being responsible for things you’ve never been responsible for before). You join the team and are expected to contribute in whatever ways are needed to maintain and run the monastery. And it is supposed to be hard, but you are training even then. </p><p>It seems possible that this month at MAPLE, I will set more deliberate intentions than I have collectively in my life until then. Which tells you just how little I’ve done things <em>on purpose, deliberately, and with intention</em> in my life. The process of how that got broken in me is probably another story for another time. </p><p>But basically, I expect to do a bunch of repetitions of training Dependability on a second-to-second level. And I will be doing this not just during meditation but also during daily work. I will also likely spend a lot of time introspecting and trying to gain insight into my blocks around Dependability. I hope to see at least a little movement in this area in the next month but may need to spend a longer period of time at MAPLE to fully develop the skill. (I noticed that residents who’d been at MAPLE for multiple years had more of the skill than those who had been there for less time.) </p><hr class=""dividerBlock""/><p>[ Note: The following section might trigger people who are scrupulous in a particular way. I want to make clear that I’m not speaking from a place of obligation or shouldy-ness or fear of being a bad or unworthy person or self-judgment. I don’t feel shame or guilt about not having Dependability. I’m speaking from a place of actively wanting to grow and feeling excited about the possibility of attaining something important to me. And I hope the same for other people, that they will be motivated <em>towards</em> having nice things. Dependability seems like a nice thing to have, but I’m not into judging people (or myself) about it. ] </p><p>Not having Dependability is a major bottleneck for me.

Be the kind of person who is reliably there for her friends and family. Be the kind of person who can become part of or contribute to something bigger than herself. Be the kind of person who wouldn’t sell out humanity for money, fame, power, convenience, security, legacy. Be the kind of person who doesn’t lie to herself about “being a good person” who “does things for the sake of progress or for the good of others”—when in truth the underlying behaviors, cruxes, and motives have little to do with the rationalizations. </p><p>I consider it my duty as a human being to develop into a virtuous person, rather than just any kind of person. And I believe Dependability is an important feature of a virtuous person. </p><p>I notice I don’t meet my personal criteria for a virtuous person as of yet, and Dependability seems like a major missing piece.</p>",,Unreal,unreal,Unreal

This particular proposal came out of a desire to use a <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00899"">debate-like</a> adversary to improve the amplification process, and the primary goal of this proposal is to show how one could do that. Though I have tried to retain a lot of the relevant detail, I have made two simplifications to make this proposal easier to specify: I am attempting to approximate something closer to <a href=""https://ai-alignment.com/humans-consulting-hch-f893f6051455"">weak HCH</a> rather than <a href=""https://ai-alignment.com/strong-hch-bedb0dc08d4e"">strong HCH</a> and I am only allowing the generation of two subquestions at a time. I am confident that those simplifications could easily be dropped, though I think doing so here would only make this presentation more complicated.</p><p>Before I proceed, I want to make one final note: this is not a proposal for how to build an aligned AGI. I think there are still a whole bunch of issues that would prevent this proposal from actually working.</p><h2>Definitions</h2><p>We will start with some initial definitions:</p><ul><li>Let <span><style>.mjx-chtml {display: inline-block; line-height: 0; text-indent: 0; text-align: left; text-transform: none; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 100%; font-size-adjust: none; letter-spacing: normal; word-wrap: normal; word-spacing: normal; white-space: nowrap; float: none; direction: ltr; max-width: none; max-height: none; min-width: 0; min-height: 0; border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 1px 0}

First, <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/EmDuGeRw749sD3GKd/p/PRaxzmDJdvie46ahL"">Paul has recently moved away from discrete amplification/distillation steps</a>. This proposal, however, provides a way to recover discrete steps while still collapsing the recursion. In practice, however, you might still just want to stick with the amplification procedure described here without doing the distillation step, as it isn&apos;t strictly necessary.</p><p>Second, this proposal uses an adversary to guide the training process. This technique is similar to the concept of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Importance_sampling"">importance sampling</a>. The main benefit of this approach is that it takes advantage of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_learning_(machine_learning)"">active learning</a> by allowing the system to choose which questions and subquestions would be most useful for it to have answered by a human.</p><p>Another benefit of the adversary, however, is that it could make transparency much easier. One of the major benefits of IDA is that <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""ML""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.081em;"">M</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">L</span></span></span></span></span></span> gets trained to approximate its own <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""ML""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.081em;"">M</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">L</span></span></span></span></span></span>-consulting-<span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""ML""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.081em;"">M</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">L</span></span></span></span></span></span> tree.

However, unfolding the entire tree is very expensive, as it&apos;s linear in the size of the tree. With an adversary, however, you can choose which portions of the tree to unfold first by calling the adversary, enabling you to find errors much more quickly; for a perfect adversary, this reduces the problem of finding an error to <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""O(\log n)""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">O</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">(</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.519em;"">log</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char""></span></span><span class=""mjx-mi MJXc-space1""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">n</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">)</span></span></span></span></span></span> instead of <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""O(n)""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">O</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">(</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">n</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">)</span></span></span></span></span></span>.</p><p>Thus, the hope is that the use of such an adversary could assist both in making IDA more competitive (by increasing sample efficiency and using active learning) and in making IDA safer (due to the increased ease of transparency).</p><p>It should be noted, however, that it is also possible that the use of such an adversary might make the safety situation for IDA worse.

Xzr3zLynG9kGHpy2Y,Deck Guide: Biomancer’s Familiar,deck-guide-biomancer-s-familiar,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Xzr3zLynG9kGHpy2Y/deck-guide-biomancer-s-familiar,2019-03-26T15:20:00.420Z,5,4,0,False,False,,"<p>Biomancer’s Familiar is a great card. I wanted it to happen so bad. I spent a substantial portion of my preperations for Cleveland trying to make Biomancer’s Familiar happen. I tried two color versions. I tried three color versions. I tried going big, going small, going wide, and everything else I could think of. I came close enough to consider buying the cards.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I could not make it happen. Blue was too strong and too structurally tough. You had to give up Pelt Collector, had to pay real mana for your spells. The format wanted different things than the Familiar deck could provide. Sideboarding wasn’t as impactful for you as I wanted. The deck was good. It was fun as hell. But not good enough. I switched to blue, tore up the ladder with it, and never looked back. Things didn’t work out at the Pro Tour, but given the overall results, I am confident I made the right decision.</p>
<p>There are three reasons to share the deck now.</p>
<p>The first reason is, as noted, that the deck is great fun. As constructed, it’s a step behind where it needs to be to win major tournamens, but it’s still good enough to get five wins more often than not in Traditional Constructed. Its best draws bury people if not answered, and it gets them often.</p>
<p>The second reason is that perhaps I missed something. There’s a lot of good things going on, so the deck might be one card, or one idea or sideboard plan, away from competitive. That might be a two color or three color build. It might involve a card from War of the Spark.</p>
<p>The third reason is that now that I write it out, I think this deck plays fine against what’s out there right now. My results weren’t as good as with blue, but perhaps things have changed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here is the strongest version of the deck:</p>
<p>3 Adventurous Impulse</p>
<p>2 Quench</p>
<p>2 Negate</p>
<p> </p>
<p>4 Llanowar Elves</p>
<p>4 Biomancer’s Familiar</p>
<p>4 Growth-Chamber Guardian</p>
<p>4 Incubation Druid</p>
<p>2 Druid of the Cowl</p>
<p>4 Sphinx of Foresight</p>
<p>4 Frilled Mystic</p>
<p>4 Biogenic Ooze</p>
<p>10 Forest</p>
<p>5 Island</p>
<p>4 Hinterland Harbor</p>
<p>4 Breeding Pool</p>
<p>
Sideboard</p>
<p>4 Kraul Harpooner</p>
<p>1 Thorn Lieutenant</p>
<p>4 Entrancing Melody</p>
<p>2 Negate</p>
<p>2 Spell Pierce</p>
<p>2 Dive Down</p>
<p>There are only eight adapt creatures in the deck for Biomancer’s Familiar. This seems light, but you have a lot of search, and more of that is not what you need. There are places where a Xengara, Utopia Speaker or two would be welcome for additional power, but I found that if we were going large and finding ways to close things out, it was better to just go straight to Biogenic Ooze. Ooze does often get a substantial boost from Biomancer’s Familiar, although those games are usually (but not always!) yours anyway.</p>
<p>This deck has a lot of mana. You have 23 lands, 3 Adventurous Impulse that will almost always hit mana if you want them to, and ten mana creatures. You also have a lot of ways to use that mana. Adventurous Impulse often finds a good sink if you want one, Sphinx sends mana away once you’re set. Incubation Druid turns into a 3/5 even without a Biomancer’s Familiar. WIth Biomancer’s Familiar it turns into a giant mana sink. Growth-Chamber Guardian eats up a lot of mana. Other games, you have a lot of mana and use it to keep counters up while developing your board. That’s fine too.</p>
<p>Path one is to go for the quick easy win. You get a lot of easy wins from a quick Biomancer’s Familiar even without Llanowar Elves. Get one out on turn 2, play a Growth-Chamber Guardian on turn 3 and turn it to 4/4 on the spot. Next turn, you’ll have a 6/6 and a 4/4 (plus a 2/2) and from there it rapidly gets worse, so those two cards together will beat most draws that can’t remove the Biomancer’s Familiar, even without additional spells.</p>
<p>The other main path is to build to five or more mana, then go for it. On turn four, you can deploy the Biomancer’s Familiar and the Growth-Chamber Guardian, or boot up the Incubation Druid right away and tap it for mana to keep going, or both. Other times, you power out a quick Biogenic Ooze instead, which also works. Having Ooze gives you extra ‘packages’ to deploy if Kaya’s Wrath or Gates Ablaze sets you back. Given Incubation Druid, you can often do this reasonably early with counter backup.</p>
<p>Playing traditional aggro-control without the boost is also strong. Force them to either walk into your counters, especially Frilled Mystic, or you can adapt if they pass, and things get steadily worse.</p>
<p>Sphinx of Foresight is a very good card that doesn’t have a good home elsewhere. This is its chance to shine, as you highly value the scry to set up your combinations, and going mana creature into turn three Sphinx of Foresight is often quite strong. If you untap with it, you often don’t have to ever tap out again and the extra scry triggers are more impactful than they appear, as once your mana is set, and especially once you find the first Growth-Chamber Guardian, you have a few very high impact cards and a lot of very low impact cards. Other times, they tap out dealing with it and you stick a Biogenic Ooze.</p>
<p>A nice bonus for this deck is that you know when Biomancer’s Familiar or Growth-Chamber Guardian isn’t doing anything for you. Sometimes you have a duplicate. Sometimes you have other uses for your mana. Sometimes there’s nothing to use the Biomancer’s Familiar on, and you have enough mana to work without it when that changes. In those cases, you can expose your creatures and let them get killed, soaking up mana and removal to make way for later. Smart opponents know that Biomancer’s Familiar is a space bunny and that space bunnies must die.</p>
<p>Sideboarding poses a problem. The deck’s cards, other than Biogenic Ooze, are all either counters, mana, or working towards making your central engine happen. What can we take out? If we put in good cards from the sideboard, are we improving matters? That’s why sideboarding wasn’t impactful enough. The new cards were good, but you have to give up a lot to put them in.</p>
<p>Matchups:</p>
<p>Blue</p>
<p>There are two problems in the blue matchup. The first is that you have a hard time stopping Curious Obsession. The four cheap counters help but if you try that you get blown out by Spell Pierce or by them not having Curious Obsession in the first place, in games where deploying mana would have let you compete. Your best weapon against Curious Obsession therefore is Sphinx of Foresight, since there are probably not putting Obsession on Mist-Cloaked Herald or Tempest Djinn, and it’s often not possible for them to hold up a counter on turn three that stops a creature. Your other best weapon is to overpower them through it. If you have Biomancer’s Familiar and Growth-Chamber Guardian, or stick a Biogenic Ooze, it is not going to much matter that they draw two cards per turn. You can also try to use your counters to stop Temptest Djinn, which is difficult for them to have counter backup to defend. Without the Djinns, they can’t bring much power to the table.</p>
<p>The other problem is that they have all the control. With lots of one drops, flyers, chump blockers, Merfolk Tricksters and counters, they choose where the battle is fought. Often you will have a lot more power, and they find a way to win regardless, especially if you had to take turns two and three setting up before things get rolling.</p>
<p>If they hang back and don’t tap mana, usually the right thing to do is develop your mana. If they fight it, you’ll still have enough and run out of counters. If they don’t fight it, you can pick up tempo and start double casting or having counter backup later. You have a lot of threats that are quite frustrating for them, and can make playing a Tempest Djinn quite perilous. Once you have them on the board, force them to make a move.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean the matchup is great. It’s definitely not, but it is winnable.</p>
<p>You can do more or less sideboarding on the margin, the detaul is something like:</p>
<p>In: +4 Kraul Harpooner, +4 Entrancing Melody, +1 Spell Pierce, +1 Negate</p>
<p>Out: -3 Adventurous Impulse, -2 Druid of the Cowl, -4 Frilled Mystic, -1 Biogenic Ooze</p>
<p>Sideboarding offers you some very strong cards. Kraul Harpooner is perfect and fits right into your strategy. You also are very good with Entrancing Melody, with so much mana as to cast it often with counter backup, while the Kraul Harpooner keeps Siren Stormcaller from getting in the way. Your core strategy is to deploy creatures, so it’s hard for them to have a lot of defenses for Entrancing Melody like Negate or Dive Down, and if they try to respond in kind then that’s the type of mana exchange that favors you quite a bit.</p>
<p>We can consider more copies of Negate, or Spell Pierce, althoguh the motivation for those cards lies elsewhere.</p>
<p>I tested Essence Capture in this and other places. It’s very cute and sometimes a true blowout when it turns on Incubation Druid or a smaller one on Growth-Chamber Guardian, but the double blue mana wasn’t quite compatible with our mana base once we see what we have to sideboard out.</p>
<p>Frilled Mystic is the easy cut. Playing a waiting game and refusing to tap mana against a deck full of one drops, where they can counter back, where the 3/2 body doesn’t have much impact, is not a good idea. The other cut turns out to be Adventurous Impulse. Even tapping one mana is often something you don’t have time for, and you’re bringing in a high impact spell for a high impact creature, which makes the card much worse. For similar reasons, you let go of Druid of the Cowl, as it doesn’t block anything and the draws it enables are often far too slow, or let them break us up with counters. That gives us room for a third Negate or first Spell Pierce. Depending on how you feel about where that leaves the mana and how much you are determined to fight Curious Obsession, you can then cut copies of Biogenic Ooze. Being on the play versus draw can also be a consideration.</p>
<p>If you wanted to improve matters further after board, you could play Crushing Canopy in the board, or have access to more copies of Quench. It’s not clear how else we can improve much.</p>
<p>Red:</p>
<p>They will kill as many creatures as they can on sight. This is wise. Your goal is to keep forcing them to do this until they run out of removal, or develop your mana so that you can slip in the engine or an Ooze while they’re tapped out. There’s a scary early phase where you can get overrun, and a scary later phase where you have to find a way to quickly turn the corner before you get burned out, and often won’t have good attacks that seem safe. Ooze is better than it looks here because it lets you close games quickly without the engine despite being low on life. Often you have to do this while holding up Frilled Mystic for many turns, which can make things tricky. Sometimes you get burned out before you can finish the job, or have to expose risk of that happening to avoid giving them too much time.</p>
<p>The other way you lose is Experimental Frenzy or Rekindling Phoenix against an unimpressive board. Ideally you have counters ready for that, and there is a point in the game where this becomes your primary concern.</p>
<p>Thus, the early turns are largely about preventing them from getting creature damage in and establishing a board that will let you sit on counters. Druid of the Cowl is very good on turn two, as they have to take time off to kill it or you get to play a Sphinx, or a two drop with counter backup, on turn three.</p>
<p>In: +1 Thorn Lieutenant, +4 Entrancing Melody, +2 Negate</p>
<p>Out: -3 Adventurous Impulse, -4 Biogenic Ooze</p>
<p>Thorn Lieutenant is in the board for this matchup in particular. Thorn Lieutenant does exactly what you want. If they try to attack into it with one and two drops, it is a perfect wall. If they kill it, you get a free 1/1 that is surprisingly annoying. Later on, it turns around and attacks and is another way to exploit Biomancer’s Familiar. Cutting the activation from six mana to four makes things a lot easier. It’s a nice to have, and it offers another long term threat in other matchups where you want that, but an easy cut from the board if you want something else badly.</p>
<p>You do already have a ton of perfectly good two drops. But many of them are long term valuable, and you want the option to hold them for the right later opportunity. You also often want to cast two of them on your four mana turn, or one per turn while holding up counters.</p>
<p>Entrancing Melody gives you coverage against Rekindling Phoenix, and is also very strong when it takes Goblin Chainwhirler. That frees up the ground for you to attack, as they lost a good blocker and a good attacker and you picked up a great additional blocker, letting you close the game out quickly. Even taking a small creature prevents them from going wide.</p>
<p>With that, you no longer need Biogenic Ooze as much, which means Adventurous Impulse gets worse, so it comes out too. The extra counters let you stop Experimental Frenzy or prevent you from being burned out later.</p>
<p>Putting in Dive Down is reasonable as well, and can lead to the engine coming online, but is a way things can go wrong if they start aiming all their removal at your head, giving you dead cards. Watch how they play and act accordingly.</p>
<p>This matchup is quite good as configured. If you don’t care about it much, you can trim an additional Druid of the Cowl and give up Thorn Lieutenant, and things worse but still fine. If you care about it a lot, you can have access to more Thorn Lieutenants, including in the main, or a third maindeck Druid of the Cowl.</p>
<p>White:</p>
<p>They can deploy a lot of power quickly. Your best draws go over the top of that fast enough to not die, unless they go completely nuts. Once you turn the corner, you can be very patient, as not much threatens you, but there is risk that they gain the ability to go wide and kill you with an Alpha strike. There are games where you spend a lot of time pumping up your team but can’t get through and they’re making tokens or keep playing creatures, and closing it out gets tricky. That got a lot easier once we added a full four Biogneic Ooze, and either that or Sphinx of Foresight can close things out.</p>
<p>Sideboarding:</p>
<p>In: +4 Entrancing Melody, +1 Thorn Lieutenant</p>
<p>Out: -1 Negate, -4 Frilled Mystic</p>
<p>There is nothing you need to counter. There are things you’d like to counter, especially removal spells, but not enough to be thrilled about holding up mana. If they show a bunch of flyers that Kraul Harpooner can pick off, I don’t mind putting a few in. It’s also a solid blocker for the early turns.</p>
<p>Esper Control:</p>
<p>Kaya’s Wrath is your enemy. They can hit you with discard and then wipe your board. That is the most common way you lose. You also need to watch out for Cry of the Crenarium if you deploy creatures in the wrong order. The other way is they counter or kill everything one by one and you run out of threats. Biogenic Ooze gives you extra good threats, especially after they Kaya’s Wrath.</p>
<p>Once you have enough stuff, sit back on counters and don’t use them on spells that don’t change the path of the game. What matters is mostly Kaya’s Wrath. Know when you need to walk into it, when you can afford to play around it, and when they’ll get enough counter backup for it.</p>
<p>Sideboarding</p>
<p>In: +2 Negate, +2 Spell Pierce, +2 Dive Down, +1 Thorn Lieutenant</p>
<p>Out: -2 Druid of the Cowl, -4 Sphinx of Foresight, -1 Adventurous Impulse</p>
<p>Sphinx is easy to answer, doesn’t hit hard, and costs too much to protect properly. Giving up the scry at the start of the game is unfortunate, but that isn’t enough to justify its presence. Adventurous Impulse gets substantially worse, but we still have a lot of strong hits and love finding Frilled Mystic, so it mostly stays despite Sphinx leaving. The Thorn Lieutenant gives you a threat that can close things out, and I’ve found it plays surprisingly well against control. But if you don’t have it, you won’t miss it much here.</p>
<p>The counters shore you up against Kaya’s Wrath and Teferi, Hero of Dominaria. Dive Down protects your key creatures against removal.</p>
<p>Nexus of Fate:</p>
<p>You’re playing a similar game to blue. They’re better at it here, as your extra power is mostly overkill, but even a worse version of this strategy still works well. Always counter Search for Azcanta, and almost always hang back on counters once they get to four.</p>
<p>Sideboarding</p>
<p>In: +2 Spell Pierce, +2 Negate</p>
<p>Out: -4 Biogenic Ooze</p>
<p>You don’t need the power Ooze provides, so take it out, deploy stuff early then sit on counters. If you aren’t happy with the matchup, add more counters to the sideboard until you are satisfied.</p>
<p>Sultai:</p>
<p>You have a few different fears to worry about. Hostage Taker on your creatures is often quite bad. In corner cases it is so bad that you need to consider holding Biogenic Ooze. If a WIldgrowth Walker goes large, it can buy a lot of time. If the game goes long enough without you closing it out with your engine or a Biogenic Ooze or Sphinx of Foresight, they will cast Hydroid Krasis one time too many for escalating sizes.</p>
<p>
Then there’s Finality. You need to be continuously aware of Finality. Sphinx of Foresight and Biogenic Ooze are both vulnerable, as are many of your cheaper creatures. Once you are clearly ahead, prioritize getting creatures to five toughness. Push a Growth-Chamber Guardian to 6/6 and leave one at 2/2 for now, which is usually right anyway. Get Incubation Druid to 3/5 even if it feels unnatural or slows things down a bit. If you can’t, consider paying a lot to hold up counters, and/or hold some creatures back. Holding up counters is how the last few turns are best handled most of the time in any case, if you have them available.</p>
<p>Sideboarding:</p>
<p>In: +4 Entrancing Melody, +2 Dive Down</p>
<p>Out: -3 Adventurous Impulse, -2 Druid of the Cowl, -1 Biogenic Ooze</p>
<p>You love the spells coming in, and need to make room. Their plan is mostly to trade cards with you in various forms and grind you out, so flooding on mana is a danger. Druid of the Cowl does not useful blocking and Adventurous Impulse can miss, while Entrancing Melody mostly only costs two mana and Dive Down costs one, and they rarely kill Llanowar Elves or a non-adapted Incubation Druid, so you’re not overly mana light.</p>
<p>I’m not sure how many copies of Negate you want. Finality is important, but so is Hostage Taker, and playing too many spells is how you run into trouble. I’m pretty unhappy that we’re cutting a Biogenic Ooze as it is to stay at eight answers.</p>
<p>Gruul:</p>
<p>Gruul smash. You build up. Who will do it better? Back when I tested no one was playing Gruul, so I don’t know. They can certainly deploy a lot of threats fast and pick off your creatures before you can do your thing, Pelt Collector is super efficient and Rekindling Phoenix is tough. If you can do your thing in full, you’ll win.</p>
<p>Sideboarding:</p>
<p>In: +4 Entrancing Melody, +2 Dive Down</p>
<p>Out: -2 Druid of the Cowl, -1 Biogenic Ooze, -1 Adventurous Impulse, -2 Negate</p>
<p>Dive Down is a better Negate, so it’s an easy swap. I can see going either up or down on answers, but I don’t think you have time for Negate, and Spell Pierce won’t play in context. Druid of the Cowl does not actually block, so go with your other two drops. That leaves two cards to bring out. Biogenic Ooze seems slow so I’m fine bringing one out, which in turn makes me like Adventurous Impulse less given how many spells I’m bringing in. This is a place to start, but it’s likely wrong.</p>
<p>Other matchups follow similar principles.</p>
<p>If you get a chance, take this deck for a spin and see what you think.</p>",,Zvi,zvi,Zvi

With the &quot;evidence&quot; of being able to complete actions, stir up your confidence of being able to complete tasks. </li><li><strong>Step 4: </strong>Choose the next stack of actions. They should be moderately difficult and involve clear steps to the solution (no &#x27;meta-actions&#x27;).

<p>In my <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/qezBTig6p6p5xtL6G/a-theory-of-human-values"">quest to synthesise human preferences</a>, I've occasionally been asked whether I distinguish moral preferences from other types of preferences - for example, whether preferences for Abba or Beethoven, or avocado or sausages, should rank as high as human rights or freedom of speech.</p>
<p>The answer is, of course not. But these are not the sort of things that should be built into the system by hand. This should be reflected in the meta-preferences. We label certain preferences ""moral"", and we often have the belief that these should have priority, to some extent, over merely ""selfish"" preferences (the extent of this belief varies from person to person, of course).</p>
<p>I deliberately wrote the wrong word there for this formalism - we don't have the ""belief"" that moral preferences are more important, we have the meta-preference that a certain class of beliefs, labelled ""moral"", <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/EEPdbtvW8ei9Yi2e8/bridging-syntax-and-semantics-empirically"">whatever that turns out to mean</a>, should be given greater weight. This is especially the case as there are a lot of cases where it is very unclear if a preference is moral or not (many people have strong moral-ish preferences over mainstream cultural and entertainment choices).</p>
<p>This is an example of the sort of challenges that a preference synthesis process should be able to figure out on its own. If the method needs to be constantly tweaked to get over every small problem of definition, then it cannot work. As always, however, it need not get everything exactly right; indeed, it needs to be robust enough that it doesn't change much if a borderline meta-preference such as ""everyone should know their own history"" gets labelled as moral or not.</p>

Most people have the wrong idea of exactly what that looks like, and those who do have the right idea often wonder if my parents can even understand what dating is like, given they've never experienced it. I've heard people assume that my parents' arranged marriage meant they were completely unable to help or give advice when it came to my dating life, and I've found the opposite to be the case; the advice my parents gave me about dating was as valuable as anything I found anywhere else, and allowed me to pass that advice on to my friends. Growing up hearing their story taught me a lot about what was important to know about myself before I started dating anyone, and how a good couple functions and grows together. I found that much of this is less commonly talked about when it comes to Western dating, and so I want to share their story and what I learned from it with you. For background, I'll start with telling you what arranged marriage is actually like.<div><br /></div><div>Although some parts of India still do the traditional ""bride and groom don't meet until the wedding"", these tend to be remote and rural parts. Most arranged marriages today function a little more like a blind date, but with your parents and their network finding you a match rather than your friends. On the more traditional end, families may set up a ""bride viewing"", which today functions like a first meeting where the parents introduce each half of the couple, then leave them alone to get to know each other. They later tell their parents if they agree to the marriage or not. On the more liberal end, a couple may go on many dates before agreeing. In some cases, young people will date and fall in love, and the parents will meet after and decide to ""arrange"" the marriage if all parties agree to it. In the case of my parents, my dad's cousin (who he was very close with) met my mother and thought they would be a good match due to compatible philosophical interests and tastes in literature. My mother had, at that point, not dated at all, despite being in graduate school; it is normal for young people in India to feel marriage is not something they have to worry too much about because they trust their families will find someone good for them. The fact that my dad's cousin met my mother and immediately thought of my father points at another way arranged marriages affect the culture: people are always on the lookout for a good match.</div><div><br /></div><div>When you ask someone who has had an arranged marriage about love, the first thing they say is that the love will come naturally once the couple is married. As a child, I always found this thought strange. As I grew older, though, I noticed the truth of this in the stories my mother told me about her relationship early on with my father. When they married, he was living in the US, and she was finishing her master's in India; for the year it took to finish her degree, they wrote letters. The way they did this nourished their love for each other, and fostered growth in their relationship. Western romance is described as something that happens on accident, but arranged romance happens on purpose. Even relationships that start with falling in love can benefit from growing and deepening that bond in the same way. This happens because you water love like a plant, and give it the right kinds of nutrients so it can grow.</div><div><br /></div><div>One of the values that my mom spoke to me about more explicitly is that of cultural compatibility. In India, marriage is arranged through the social network of the parents. Traditionally, this focused a lot on social standing and religion, because of the idea that families of the same groups will raise their children similarly, and have similar values. My parents both grew up valuing learning and knowledge. They would have been far less compatible with people who were more focused on material wealth, or spiritual minimalism. Because their families had similar values, they were each instilled with similar values. This is reinforced by the fact that India is a more collectivist culture, and thus it is thought that your family knows you better than anyone else. Those who know you best are more likely to have a sense of who you would get along with, whether they're related to you or not. Further, getting along with the people your partner cares about most is important in any long term relationship. The fact that my mom got along well with my dad's cousin was a good sign; my mom connected more with the rest of my dad's family after the marriage, even though my dad had to go back to the US. Whether the relationship is arranged or not, fostering individual relationships with the people your partner cares about helps strengthen your relationship.</div><div><br /></div><div>Compatibility includes not only what you value, but also what you want. Around the time my mother was getting married, many people her age were talking about wanting to move to the US. She was one of the few who wasn't fussed; she felt she'd be just as happy continuing to live in India. Of course, when she met my dad, that changed. For the right person, she was willing to move. There are people who wouldn't have been willing to make that move for anything, and there are those who wanted to move so badly that they didn't want to marry anyone willing to stay. This can be applied to anything one might want out of life, from living situation to religion to children, and more. In Western romantic media, this is often portrayed as being heartless. Ultimately, though, it's about trade-offs. Does your love for the person really overpower how much you want something? That answer differs for everyone. You can say that love conquers all, but a mismatch in this type of compatibility is one of the most common causes for divorce in the US. Knowing what you want your life to look like before you find the person to spend it with is going to be easier than trying to convince someone else to change what they want.</div><div><br /></div><div>Of course, compatibility is nothing if you're not also complementary. This is where modern dating begins to look like marketing: know your target audience, and know what they want. If you know what kind of values you want your partner to have, you might already have a vague sense of what they would be like as a person. Knowing what you provide is crucial, especially when it comes to things like online dating. Traditional gender roles cover this well if you fit neatly in to one or the other, but things don't work that way for everyone. Give that my dad lived in the US, the fact that he could provide citizenship was huge. But he would not have been satisfied with a marriage with someone who saw this as his biggest asset. The fact that my mother was not obsessed with moving to the US meant that their complementary focus had to happen elsewhere. They shared the value of intellectual engagement, but my dad was always more focused on abstract ideas, while my mother tended to think more concretely. Here was where they were able to complement each other, which gave their life together more balance, and helped foster their growth individually as well. Finding someone whose traits and skills complement yours can help cover areas of life you struggle with, provide perspective when needed, and encourage you to grow and learn new things.</div><div><br /></div><div>As a child, I didn't see the story of my parents as a love story. Love stories were about falling madly, hopelessly, and deeply, all at once, and my parents never really had that. But as I grew older, I noticed the details of their relationship. When my dad bought her a nice dress, it was as much because he wanted to see her in it as it was because he knew she hated shopping. When she challenged his ideas, it was out of love and respect, more than anything else. When we did things together as a family, they made sure to take time to connect with each other as a couple, even if it was only briefly. And as I became more independent, they were able to spend more and more time together. Love that lasts over a lifetime doesn't stay the same; it grows and changes with you as you grow and change. Falling in love doesn't happen once, but again and again.</div></div>",,squidious,squidious,squidious

<p>Despite not having any business background, she climbed the rank from entry level employee to become a regional head, surpassing everyone else from prestigious business degrees and rich experiences.</p>
<p>One success driver she mentioned got my attention.
Despite lagging very much behind at the beginning, the core to her success is that <strong>she always aims for 120% result of any task in front of her.</strong></p>
<p>The reason why this interests me is not because of my fresh ears.</p>
<p>In fact, this is not the first time I heard of this concept.
Not the first time I get inspired of giving it all to whatever is in front.
Not the first time I try…and not the first time I fail.</p>
<p>Did I not put in enough effort?</p>
<p>No…in fact, I put in so much effort to make this concept come to live, not realising that while effort is highly important, it’s critically inadequate.</p>
<p>As I listened to this amazing regional head talking about different aspects of her life, I came to realisation on what I have always been missing so far.</p>
<p>To make each task yield 120%, apart from effort, we should also look at our <strong>time and energy balance.</strong></p>
<p>Contributing the best on a task means to give the amount of time and energy in the level required to make the result best.</p>
<p>We cannot contribute what we don’t have.</p>
<p>No matter how much effort we try to give adequate time required for the best, we only have 24 hours a day.</p>
<p>No matter how much energy we try to put into each task, we only have a limited stream in each day.</p>
<p>Therefore, giving our best does not start from the moment we begin working…but from the moment we plan our schedule and project pipelines.</p>
<p><strong>When having ""Enough Time"" is Not Enough</strong>
When my boss asked if I have enough time to take on one additional project, I would look at how much time is required to finish all the tasks on my desk and then, most of the time, said ""Yes"" thinking I have enough time to finish it all.</p>
<p>However, there is a difference between <em>having enough time to finish it all</em> and <em>having time to make it best.</em></p>
<p>Coming back to evaluate all the projects in my pipeline, I realize that the time I have is only enough to finish all up, but not to go above and beyond.</p>
<p>I have two choices:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Finishing a lot of tasks with average results
OR</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Complete major task with the best impact that goes beyond expectations</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no right answer here, but for my situation, the second works better.</p>
<p><strong>Even having Time is Sometimes Not Enough</strong>
Having time is good.
But having time without full energy...hmm...unlikely to be productive.</p>
<p>Another good lesson I learned from this talk is that <em>ample time to do it best</em> should always come with <em>ample energy</em>.</p>
<p>It's just normal to plan business projects with the right balance between high-low energy requirement. However...our energy pool is not limited only in working hours, but also in personal life.</p>
<p>One thing I learned is that when looking at high-low energy requirement in my activities list, I should include all activities both in office and at home.</p>
<p>Despite saying ""I only have one major project going on during working hours"", if this lady has to practice running a marathon at night with high intensity, how would she have enough energy to do both best, despite marathon not being related to works.</p>
<p>To summarize, with one key success driver in career being to do our best in the tasks at hand (eg. the concept to deliver 120%), many ambitious people try to put in so much effort to ensure the best results. However, the best results actually begin even before we start doing each task...but begins during project planning, in which <em>time and energy balance</em> would determine how our project results would turn out to be.</p>

This then raises the question of how that collection of subagents can exhibit <u><a href=""https://arbital.com/p/optimized_agent_appears_coherent/"">coherent</a></u> behavior: after all, many ways of aggregating the preferences of a number of agents fail to create consistent preference orderings.</p><p>We can roughly describe coherence as the property that, if you become aware that there exists a more optimal strategy for achieving your goals than the one that you are currently executing, then you will switch to that better strategy. If an agent is not coherent in this way, then <u><a href=""https://arbital.com/p/expected_utility_formalism/?l=7hh"">bad things are likely to happen</a></u> to them.</p><p>Now, we all know that humans sometimes express incoherent behavior. But on the whole, people still do okay: the median person in a developed country still manages to survive until their body starts giving up on them, and typically also manages to have and raise some number of initially-helpless children until <em>they</em> are old enough to take care of themselves. </p><p>For a subagent theory of mind, we would like to have some explanation of when exactly the subagents manage to be collectively coherent (that is, change their behavior to some better one), and what are the situations in which they fail to do so. The conclusion of this post will be:</p><blockquote>We are capable of changing our behaviors on occasions when the mind-system as a whole puts sufficiently high probability on the new behavior being better, when the new behavior is not being blocked by a particular highly weighted subagent (such as an IFS-style protector) that puts high probability on it being bad, and when we have enough <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yLLkWMDbC9ZNKbjDG/slack"">slack</a></u> in our lives for any new behaviors to be evaluated in the first place. Akrasia is subagent disagreement about what to do.</blockquote><h1>Correcting your behavior as a default</h1><p>There are many situations in which we exhibit incoherent behavior simply because we&#x2019;re not aware of it. For instance, suppose that I do my daily chores in a particular order, when doing them in some other order would save more time. If you point this out to me, I&#x2019;m likely to just say &#x201C;oh&#x201D;, and then adopt the better system.</p><p>Similarly, several of the experiments which get people to exhibit incoherent behavior rely on showing different groups of people different formulations of the same question, and then indicating that different framings of the same question get different answers from people. It doesn&#x2019;t work quite as well if you show the different formulations to the <em>same</em> people, because then many of them will realize that differing answers would be inconsistent.</p><p>But there are also situations in which someone realizes that they are behaving in a nonsensical way, yet will continue behaving in that way. Since people usually <em>can</em> change suboptimal behaviors, we need an explanation for why they sometimes <em>can&#x2019;t</em>.</p><h1>Towers of protectors as a method for coherence</h1><p>In my <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5gfqG3Xcopscta3st/building-up-to-an-internal-family-systems-model"">post about Internal Family Systems</a></u>, I discussed a model of mind composed of several different kinds of subagents. One of them, the default planning subagent, is a module just trying to straightforwardly find the best thing to do and then execute that. On the other hand, <em>protector</em> subagents exist to prevent the system from getting into situations which were catastrophic before. If they think that the default planning subagent is doing something which seems dangerous, they will override it and do something else instead. (Previous versions of the IFS post called the default planning agent, &#x201C;a reinforcement learning subagent&#x201D;, but this was potentially misleading since several other subagents were reinforcement learning ones too, so I&#x2019;ve changed the name.) </p><p>Thus, your behavior can still be coherent even if you <em>feel</em> that you are failing to act in a coherent way. You simply don&#x2019;t realize that a protector is carrying out a routine intended to avoid dangerous outcomes - and this might actually be a very successful way of keeping you out of danger. Some subagents in your mind think that doing X would be a superior strategy, but the protector thinks that it would be a horrible idea - so from the point of view of the system as a whole, doing X is <em>not</em> a better strategy, so not switching to it is actually better.</p><p>On the other hand, it may also be the case that the protector&#x2019;s behavior, while keeping you out of situations which the protector considers unacceptable, is causing other outcomes which are <em>also</em> unacceptable. The default planning subagent may realize this - but as already established, any protector can overrule it, so this doesn&#x2019;t help.</p><p>Evolution&#x2019;s answer here seems to be <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NQgWL7tvAPgN2LTLn/spaghetti-towers"">spaghetti towers</a></u>. The default planning subagent might <em>eventually</em> figure out the better strategy, which avoids both the thing that the protector is trying to block <em>and</em> the new bad outcome. But it could be dangerous to wait that long, especially since the default planning agent doesn&apos;t have direct access to the protector&apos;s goals. So for the same reasons why a separate protector subagent was created to avoid the <em>first</em> catastrophe, the mind will create or recruit a protector to avoid the <em>second</em> catastrophe - the one that the first protector keeps causing.</p><p>With permission, I&#x2019;ll borrow the illustrations from eukaryote&#x2019;s spaghetti tower post to illustrate this.</p><p>Example Eric grows up in an environment where he learns that disagreeing with other people is unsafe, and that he should always agree to do things that other people ask of him. So Eric develops a protector subagent running a pleasing, submissive behavior.</p><span><figure><img src=""https://stuff.kajsotala.fi/LW/Brain/Spaghetti1.jpg"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:40%""></figure></span><p>Unfortunately, while this tactic worked in Eric&#x2019;s childhood home, once he became an adult he starts saying &#x201C;yes&#x201D; to too many things, without leaving any time for his own needs. But saying &#x201C;no&#x201D; to anything still feels unsafe, so he can&#x2019;t just stop saying &#x201C;yes&#x201D;. Instead he develops a protector which tries to keep him out of situations where people would ask him to do anything. This way, he doesn&#x2019;t need to say &#x201C;no&#x201D;, and also won&#x2019;t get overwhelmed by all the things that he has promised to do. The two protectors together form a composite strategy.</p><span><figure><img src=""https://stuff.kajsotala.fi/LW/Brain/Spaghetti2.jpg"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:40%""></figure></span><p>While this helps, it still doesn&#x2019;t entirely solve the issue. After all, there are plenty of reasons that might push Eric into situations where someone would ask something of him. He still ends up agreeing to do lots of things, to the point of neglecting his own needs. Eventually, his brain creates another protector subagent. This one causes exhaustion and depression, so that he now has a socially-acceptable reason for being unable to do all the things that he has promised to do. He continues saying &#x201C;yes&#x201D; to things, but also keeps apologizing for being unable to do things that he (honestly) intended to do as promised, and eventually people realize that you probably shouldn&#x2019;t ask him to do anything that&#x2019;s really important to get done.</p><span><figure><img src=""https://stuff.kajsotala.fi/LW/Brain/Spaghetti3.jpg"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:40%""></figure></span><p>And while this kind of a process of stacking protector on top of a protector is not perfect, for most people it mostly works out okay. Almost everyone ends up having their unique set of minor neuroses and situations where they don&#x2019;t quite behave rationally, but as they learn to understand themselves better, their default planning subagent gets better at working around those issues. This might also make the various protectors relax a bit, since the various threats are generally avoided and there isn&#x2019;t a need to keep avoiding them. </p><p>Gradually, as negative consequences to different behaviors become apparent, behavior gets adjusted - either by the default planning subagents or by spawning more protectors - and remains coherent overall.</p><p>But sometimes, especially for people in highly stressful environments where almost any mistake may get them punished, or when they end up in an environment that their old tower of protectors is no longer well-suited for (distributional shift), things don&#x2019;t go as well. In that situation, their minds may end up looking like this a hopelessly tangled web, where they have almost no flexibility. Something happens in their environment, which sets off one protector, which sets off another, which sets off another - leaving them with no room for flexibility or rational planning, but rather forcing them to act in a way which is almost bound to only make matters worse.</p><span><figure><img src=""https://stuff.kajsotala.fi/LW/Brain/Spaghetti4.jpg"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:40%""></figure></span><p>This kind of an outcome is obviously bad. So besides building spaghetti towers, the second strategy which the mind has evolved to employ for keeping its behavior coherent while piling up protectors, is the ability to re-process memories of past painful events. </p><p>As I discussed in my original IFS post, the mind has methods for bringing up the original memories which caused a protector to emerge, in order to re-analyze them. If ending up in some situation is actually no longer catastrophic (for instance, you are no longer in your childhood home where you get punished simply for not wanting to do something), then the protectors which were focused on avoiding that outcome can relax and take a less extreme role. </p><p>For this purpose, there seems to be a built-in tension. Exiles (the IFS term for subagents containing memories of past trauma) &#x201C;want&#x201D; to be healed and will do things like occasionally sending painful memories or feelings into consciousness so as to become the center of attention, especially if there is something about the current situation which resembles the past trauma. This also acts as what my IFS post called a fear model - something that warns of situations which resemble the past trauma enough to be considered dangerous in their own right. At the same time, protectors &#x201C;want&#x201D; to keep the exiles hidden and inactive, doing anything that they can for keeping them so. Various schools of therapy - IFS one of them - seek to tap into this existing tension so as to reveal the trauma, trace it back to its original source, and heal it.</p><h1>Coherence and conditioned responses</h1><p>Besides the presence of protectors, another possibility for why we might fail to change our behavior are strongly conditioned habits. Most human behavior involves automatic habits: behavioral routines which are triggered by some sort of a cue in the environment, and lead to or have once led to a reward. (<u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5wMTZLZZmZEbXdoMD/how-habits-work-and-how-you-may-control-them"">Previous discussion</a></u>; <u><a href=""http://clawbiespups.yolasite.com/resources/Don&apos;t%20shoot%20the%20dog.pdf"">see also</a></u>.) </p><p>The problem with this is that people might end up with habits that they wouldn&#x2019;t want to have. For instance, I might develop a habit of checking social media on their phone when I&#x2019;m bored, creating a loop of boredom (cue) -&gt; looking at social media (behavior) -&gt; seeing something interesting on social media (reward). </p><p>Reflecting on this behavior, I notice that back when I <em>didn&#x2019;t</em> do it, my mind was more free to wander when I was bored, generating motivation and ideas. I think that my old behavior was more valuable than my new one. But even so, my new behavior still delivers enough momentary satisfaction to keep reinforcing the habit.</p><p>Subjectively, this feels like an increasing compulsion to check my phone, which I try to resist since I know that long-term it would be a better idea to not be checking my phone all the time. But as the compulsion keeps growing stronger and stronger, eventually I give up and look at the phone anyway.</p><p>The exact neuroscience of what is happening at such a moment remains only partially understood (<u><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4864984/"">Simpson &amp; Balsam 2016</a></u>). However, we know that whenever different subsystems in the brain produce conflicting motor commands, that conflict needs to be resolved, with only one at a time being granted access to the &#x201C;final common motor path&#x201D;. This is thought to happen in the basal ganglia, a part of the brain closely involved in action selection and connected to the <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/x4n4jcoDP7xh5LWLq/book-summary-consciousness-and-the-brain"">global neuronal workspace</a></u>. </p><p>One model (e.g. <u><a href=""http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Basal_ganglia"">Redgrave 2007</a></u>, <u><a href=""http://www-3.unipv.it/dsffcm/pagine/labs/perin/oldstuff/kiro/basal%20ganglia%20loops.pdf"">McHaffie 2005</a></u>) is that the basal ganglia receives inputs from many different brain systems; each of those systems can send different &#x201C;bids&#x201D; supporting or opposing a specific course of action to the basal ganglia. A bid submitted by one subsystem may, through looped connections going back from the basal ganglia, inhibit other subsystems, until one of the proposed actions becomes sufficiently dominant to be taken.</p><span><figure><img src=""https://stuff.kajsotala.fi/LW/Brain/BasalGanglia.gif"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:40%""></figure></span><p>The above image from <u><a href=""http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Basal_ganglia"">Redgrave 2007</a></u> has a conceptual image of the model, with two example subsystems shown. Suppose that you are eating at a restaurant in Jurassic Park when two velociraptors charge in through the window. Previously, your hunger system was submitting successful bids for the &#x201C;let&#x2019;s keep eating&#x201D; action, which then caused inhibitory impulses to the be sent to the threat system. This inhibition prevented the threat system from making bids for silly things like jumping up from the table and running away in a panic. However, as your brain registers the new situation, the threat system gets significantly more strongly activated, sending a strong bid for the &#x201C;let&#x2019;s run away&#x201D; action. As a result of the basal ganglia receiving that bid, an inhibitory impulse is routed from the basal ganglia to the subsystem which was previously submitting bids for the &#x201C;let&#x2019;s keep eating&#x201D; actions. This makes the threat system&#x2019;s bids even stronger relative to the (inhibited) eating system&#x2019;s bids.</p><p>Soon the basal ganglia, which was previously inhibiting the threat subsystem&#x2019;s access to the motor system while allowing the eating system access, withdraws that inhibition and starts inhibiting the eating system&#x2019;s access instead. The result is that you jump up from your chair and begin to run away. Unfortunately, this is hopeless since the velociraptor is faster than you. A few moments later, the velociraptor&#x2019;s basal ganglia gives the raptor&#x2019;s &#x201C;eating&#x201D; subsystem access to the raptor&#x2019;s motor system, letting it happily munch down its latest meal.</p><p>But let&#x2019;s leave velociraptors behind and go back to our original example with the phone. Suppose that you have been trying to replace the habit of looking at your phone when bored, to instead smiling and directing your attention to pleasant sensations in your body, and then letting your mind wander. </p><p>Until the new habit establishes itself, the two habits will compete for control. Frequently, the old habit will be stronger, and you will just automatically check your phone without even remembering that you were supposed to do something different. For this reason, behavioral change programs may first spend several weeks just practicing <em>noticing</em> the situations in which you engage in the old habit. When you <em>do</em> notice what you are about to do, then more goal-directed subsystems may send bids towards the &#x201C;smile and look for nice sensations&#x201D; action. If this happens and you pay attention to your experience, you may notice that long-term it actually feels more pleasant than looking at the phone, reinforcing the new habit until it becomes prevalent.</p><p>To put this in terms of the subagent model, we might drastically simplify things by saying that the neural pattern corresponding to the old habit is a subagent reacting to a specific sensation (boredom) in the consciousness workspace: its reaction is to generate an intention to look at the phone. At first, you might train the subagent responsible for monitoring the contents of your consciousness, to output <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/AhcEaqWYpa2NieNsK/subagents-introspective-awareness-and-blending"">moments of introspective awareness</a></u> highlighting when that intention appears. That introspective awareness helps alert a goal-directed subagent to try to trigger the new habit instead. Gradually, a neural circuit corresponding to the new habit gets trained up, which starts sending its own bids when it detects boredom. Over time, reinforcement learning in the basal ganglia starts giving that subagent&#x2019;s bids more weight relative to the old habit&#x2019;s, until it no longer needs the goal-directed subagent&#x2019;s support in order to win.</p><p>Now this model helps incorporate things like the role of having a vivid emotional motivation, a sense of hope, or psyching yourself up when trying to achieve habit change. Doing things like imagining an outcome that you wish the habit to lead to, may activate additional subsystems which care about those kinds of outcomes, causing them to submit additional bids in favor of the new habit. The extent to which you succeed at doing so, depends on the extent to which your mind-system considers it <em>plausible</em> that the new habit leads to the new outcome. For instance, if you imagine your exercise habit making you strong and healthy, then subagents which care about strength and health might activate to the extent that you believe this to be a likely outcome, sending bids in favor of the exercise action.</p><p>On this view, one way for the mind to maintain coherence and readjust its behaviors, is its ability to re-evaluate old habits in light of which subsystems get activated when reflecting on the possible consequences of new habits. An old habit having been strongly reinforced reflects that a great deal of evidence has accumulated in favor of it being beneficial, but the behavior in question can still be overridden if enough influential subsystems weigh in with their evaluation that a new behavior would be more beneficial in expectation. </p><p>Some subsystems having concerns (e.g. immediate survival) which are ranked more highly than others (e.g. creative exploration) means that the decision-making process ends up carrying out an implicit expected utility calculation. The strengths of bids submitted by different systems do not just reflect the probability that those subsystems put on an action being the most beneficial. There are also different mechanisms giving the bids from different subsystems varying amounts of weight, depending on how important the concerns represented by that subsystem happen to be in that situation. This ends up doing something like weighting the probabilities by utility, with the kinds of utility calculations that are chosen by evolution and culture in a way to maximize genetic fitness on average. Protectors, of course, are subsystems whose bids are weighted particularly strongly, since the system puts high utility on avoiding the kinds of outcomes they are trying to avoid.</p><p>The original question which motivated this section was: why are we sometimes incapable of adopting a new habit or abandoning an old one, despite knowing that to be a good idea? And the answer is: because we <em>don&#x2019;t</em> know that such a change would be a good idea. Rather, <em>some</em> subsystems <em>think</em> that it would be a good idea, but other subsystems remain unconvinced. Thus the system&#x2019;s overall judgment is that the old behavior should be maintained.</p><h1>Interlude: Minsky on mutually bidding subagents</h1><blockquote>I was trying to concentrate on a certain problem but was getting bored and sleepy. Then I imagined that one of my competitors, Professor Challenger, was about to solve the same problem. An angry wish to frustrate Challenger then kept me working on the problem for a while. The strange thing was, this problem was not of the sort that ever interested Challenger.</blockquote><blockquote>What makes us use such roundabout techniques to influence ourselves? Why be so indirect, inventing misrepresentations, fantasies, and outright lies? Why can&apos;t we simply tell ourselves to do the things we want to do? [...]</blockquote><blockquote>Apparently, what happened was that my agency for Work exploited Anger to stop Sleep. But why should Work use such a devious trick?</blockquote><blockquote>To see why we have to be so indirect, consider some alternatives. If Work could simply turn off Sleep, we&apos;d quickly wear our bodies out. If Work could simply switch Anger on, we&apos;d be fighting all the time. Directness is too dangerous. We&apos;d die.</blockquote><blockquote>Extinction would be swift for a species that could simply switch off hunger or pain. Instead, there must be checks and balances. We&apos;d never get through one full day if any agency could seize and hold control over all the rest. This must be why our agencies, in order to exploit each other&apos;s skills, have to discover such roundabout pathways. All direct connections must have been removed in the course of our evolution.</blockquote><blockquote>This must be one reason why we use fantasies: to provide the missing paths. You may not be able to make yourself angry simply by deciding to be angry, but you can still imagine objects or situations that make you angry. In the scenario about Professor Challenger, my agency Work exploited a particular memory to arouse my Anger&apos;s tendency to counter Sleep. This is typical of the tricks we use for self-control.</blockquote><blockquote>Most of our self-control methods proceed unconsciously, but we sometimes resort to conscious schemes in which we offer rewards to ourselves: &quot;If I can get this project done, I&apos;ll have more time for other things.&quot; However, it is not such a simple thing to be able to bribe yourself. To do it successfully, you have to discover which mental incentives will actually work on yourself. This means that you - or rather, your agencies - have to learn something about one another&apos;s dispositions. In this respect the schemes we use to influence ourselves don&apos;t seem to differ much from those we use to exploit other people - and, similarly, they often fail. When we try to induce ourselves to work by offering ourselves rewards, we don&apos;t always keep our bargains; we then proceed to raise the price or even deceive ourselves, much as one person may try to conceal an unattractive bargain from another person.</blockquote><blockquote>Human self-control is no simple skill, but an ever-growing world of expertise that reaches into everything we do. Why is it that, in the end, so few of our self-incentive tricks work well? Because, as we have seen, directness is too dangerous. If self-control were easy to obtain, we&apos;d end up accomplishing nothing at all.</blockquote><p>-- Marvin Minsky, <em>The Society of Mind</em></p><h1>Akrasia is subagent disagreement</h1><p>You might feel that the above discussion doesn&#x2019;t still entirely resolve the original question. After all, sometimes we <em>do</em> manage to change even strongly conditioned habits pretty quickly. Why is it sometimes hard and sometimes easier?</p><p><u><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3124757/#S4title"">Redgrave et al. (2010)</a></u> discuss two modes of behavioral control: goal-directed versus habitual. Goal-directed control is a relatively slow mode of decision-making, where &#x201C;action selection is determined primarily by the relative utility of predicted outcomes&#x201D;, whereas habitual control involves more directly conditioned stimulus-response behavior. Which kind of subsystem is in control is complicated, and depends on a variety of factors (the following quote has been edited to remove footnotes to references; see the original for those):</p><blockquote>Experimentally, several factors have been shown to determine whether the agent (animal or human) operates in goal-directed or habitual mode. The first is over-training: here, initial control is largely goal-directed, but with consistent and repeated training there is a gradual shift to stimulus&#x2013;response, habitual control. Once habits are established, habitual responding tends to dominate, especially in stressful situations in which quick reactions are required. The second related factor is task predictability: in the example of driving, talking on a mobile phone is fine so long as everything proceeds predictably. However, if something unexpected occurs, such as someone stepping out into the road, there is an immediate switch from habitual to goal-directed control. Making this switch takes time and this is one of the reasons why several countries have banned the use of mobile phones while driving. The third factor is the type of reinforcement schedule: here, fixed-ratio schedules promote goal-directed control as the outcome is contingent on responding (for example, a food pellet is delivered after every n responses). By contrast, interval schedules (for example, schedules in which the first response following a specified period is rewarded) facilitate habitual responding because contingencies between action and outcome are variable. Finally, stress, often in the form of urgency, has a powerful influence over which mode of control is used. The fast, low computational requirements of stimulus&#x2013;response processing ensure that habitual control predominates when circumstances demand rapid reactions (for example, pulling the wrong way in an emergency when driving on the opposite side of the road). Chronic stress also favours stimulus&#x2013;response, habitual control. For example, rats exposed to chronic stress become, in terms of their behavioural responses, insensitive to changes in outcome value and resistant to changes in action&#x2013;outcome contingency. [...]</blockquote><blockquote>Although these factors can be seen as promoting one form of instrumental control over the other, real-world tasks often have multiple components that must be performed simultaneously or in rapid sequences. Taking again the example of driving, a driver is required to continue steering while changing gear or braking. During the first few driving lessons, when steering is not yet under automatic stimulus&#x2013;response control, things can go horribly awry when the new driver attempts to change gears. By contrast, an experienced (that is, &#x2018;over-trained&#x2019;) driver can steer, brake and change gear automatically, while holding a conversation, with only fleeting contributions from the goal-directed control system. This suggests that many skills can be deconstructed into sequenced combinations of both goal-directed and habitual control working in concert. [...]</blockquote><blockquote>Nevertheless, a fundamental problem remains: at any point in time, which mode should be allowed to control which component of a task? Daw et al. have used a computational approach to address this problem. Their analysis was based on the recognition that goal-directed responding is flexible but slow and carries comparatively high computational costs as opposed to the fast but inflexible habitual mode. They proposed a model in which the relative uncertainty of predictions made by each control system is tracked. In any situation, the control system with the most accurate predictions comes to direct behavioural output.</blockquote><p>Note those last sentences: besides the subsystems making their own predictions, there might also be a meta-learning system keeping track of which other subsystems tend to make the most accurate predictions in each situation, giving extra weight to the bids of the subsystem which has tended to perform the best in that situation. We&#x2019;ll come back to that in future posts.</p><p>This seems compatible with my experience in that, I feel like it&#x2019;s possible for me to change even entrenched habits relatively quickly - <em>assuming that the new habit really is unambiguously better</em>. In that case, while I might forget and lapse to the old habit a few times, there&#x2019;s still a rapid feedback loop which quickly indicates that the goal-directed system is simply <em>right</em> about the new habit being better. </p><p>Or, the behavior in question might be sufficiently complex and I might be sufficiently inexperienced at it, that the goal-directed (default planning) subagent has always mostly remained in control of it. In that case change is again easy, since there is no strong habitual pattern to override.</p><p>In contrast, in cases where it&#x2019;s hard to establish a new behavior, there tends to be some kind of genuine uncertainty:</p><ul><li>The benefits of the old behavior have been validated in the form of direct experience (e.g. unhealthy food that tastes good, has in fact tasted good each time), whereas the benefits of the new behavior come from a less trusted information source which is harder to validate (e.g. I&#x2019;ve read scientific studies about the long-term health risks of this food).</li><li>Immediate vs. long-term rewards: the more remote the rewards, the larger the risk that they will for some reason never materialize.</li><li>High vs. low variance: sometimes when I&#x2019;m bored, looking at my phone produces genuinely <em>better</em> results than letting my thoughts wander. E.g. I might see an interesting article or discussion, which gives me novel ideas or insights that I would not otherwise have had. Basically looking at my phone usually produces worse results than not looking at it - but sometimes it also produces much better ones than the alternative.</li><li>Situational variables affecting the value of the behaviors: looking at my phone can be a way to escape uncomfortable thoughts or sensations, for which purpose it&#x2019;s often excellent. This then also tends to reinforce the behavior of looking at the phone when I&#x2019;m in the same situation otherwise, but <em>without</em> uncomfortable sensations that I&#x2019;d like to escape.</li></ul><p>When there is significant uncertainty, the brain seems to fall back to those responses which have worked the best in the past - which seems like a reasonable approach, given that <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CW6HDvodPpNe38Cry/aiming-at-the-target"">intelligence involves hitting tiny targets in a huge search space</a></u>, so most novel responses are likely to be wrong. </p><p>As the above excerpt noted, the tendency to fall back to old habits is exacerbated during times of stress. The authors attribute it to the need to act quickly in stressful situations, which seems correct - but I would also emphasize the fact that negative emotions in general tend to be signs of something being wrong. E.g. <u><a href=""https://www.princeton.edu/~nivlab/papers/EldarRutledgeEtAl2016.pdf"">Eldar et al. (2016)</a></u> note that positive or negative moods tend to be related to whether things are going better or worse than expected, and suggest that mood is a <em>computational representation of momentum</em>, acting as a sort of global update to our reward expectations. </p><p>For instance, if an animal finds more fruit than it had been expecting, that may indicate that spring is coming. A shift to a good mood and being &#x201C;irrationally optimistic&#x201D; about finding fruit even in places where the animal hasn&#x2019;t seen fruit in a while, may actually serve as a rational pre-emptive update to its expectations. In a similar way, things going less well than expected may be a sign of some more general problem, necessitating fewer exploratory behaviors and less risk-taking, so falling back into behaviors for which there is a higher certainty of them working out.</p><p>So to repeat the summary that I had in the beginning: we are capable of changing our behaviors on occasions when the mind-system as a whole puts sufficiently high probability on the new behavior being better, when the new behavior is not being blocked by a particular highly weighted subagent (such as an IFS protector whose bids get a lot of weight) that puts high probability on it being bad, and when we have enough <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yLLkWMDbC9ZNKbjDG/slack"">slack</a></u> in our lives for any new behaviors to be evaluated in the first place. Akrasia is subagent disagreement about what to do.</p>",,Kaj_Sotala,kaj_sotala,Kaj_Sotala

The chapter on the Amish made a couple interesting claims, which changed my conception of that culture (although I&#x27;m not very confident that the Amish would endorse these claims as fair descriptions).</p><h2>Strategic Norms Around Technology</h2><p>The Amish relationship to technology is not &quot;stick to technology from the 1800s&quot;, but rather &quot;carefully think about how technology will affect your culture, and only include technology that does what you want.&quot;</p><p>So, electric heaters are fine. <em>Central</em> heating in a building is not. This is because if there&#x27;s a space-heater in the living room, this encourages the family to congregate together. Whereas if everyone has heating in their room, they&#x27;re more likely to spend time apart from each other. </p><p>Some communities allow tractors, but only if they don&#x27;t have rubber tires. This makes them good for tilling fields but bad for driving around.</p><p>Cars and telephones are particularly important not to allow, because easy transportation and communication creates a slippery slope to full-connection to the outside world. And a lot of the Amish lifestyle depends on cutting themselves off from the various pressures and incentives present in the rest of the world.</p><p>Some Amish communities allow people to borrow telephones or cars from non-Amish neighbors. I might have considered this hypocritical. But in the context of &quot;strategic norms of technology&quot;, it need not be. The important bit is to <em>add friction</em> to transportation and communication. </p><h2>Competitive Dictatorship</h2><p>Officially, most Amish congregations operate via something-like-consensus (I&#x27;m not sure I understood this). But Friedman&#x27;s claim is that in practice, most people tend to go with what the local bishop says. This makes a bishop something like a dictator.</p><p>But, there are lots of Amish communities, and if you don&#x27;t like the direction a bishop is pushing people in, or how they are resolving disputes, you can leave. There is a spectrum of communities ranging in how strict they are about about various rules, and they make decisions mostly independently.</p><p>So there is not only strategic norms around technology, but a fairly interesting, semi-systematic exploration of those norms.</p><hr class=""dividerBlock""/><h2>Other Applications</h2><p>I wouldn&#x27;t want to be Amish-in-particular, but the setup here is very interesting to me. </p><p>I know some people who went to <a href=""https://www.monasticacademy.com/"">MAPLE</a>, a monastery program. While there, there were limits on technology that meant, after 9pm, you basically had two choices: read, or go to bed. The choices were strongly reinforced by the social and physical environment. And this made it much easier to make choices they endorsed.</p><p>Contrast this with my current house, where a) you face basically infinite choices about to spend your time, and b) in practice, the nightly choices often end up being something like &quot;stay up till 1am playing minecraft with housemates&quot; or &quot;stay up till 2am playing minecraft with housemates.&quot;</p><p>I&#x27;m interested in the question &quot;okay, so... my goals are not the Amish goals. But, what <em>are</em> my goals exactly, and is there enough consensus around particular goals to make valid choices around norms and technology other than &#x27;anything goes?&#x27;&quot;</p><p>There are issues you face that make this hard, though:</p><p><strong>Competition with the Outside World –</strong> The Amish system works because it cuts itself off from the outside world, and its most important technological choices directly cause that. Your business can&#x27;t get outcompeted by someone else who opens up their shop on Sundays because there is nobody who opens their shop on Sundays.</p><p>You also might have goals that directly involve the outside world. </p><p>(The Amish also have good relationships with the government such that they can get away with implementing their own legal systems and get exceptions for things like school-laws. If you want to do something on their scale, you <em>both </em>would need to not attract the ire of the government, and be good enough at rolling your own legal system to not screw things up and drive people away)</p><p><strong>Lack of Mid-Scale-Coordination –</strong> I&#x27;ve tried to implement 10pm bedtimes. It fails, horribly, because I frequently attend events that last till midnight or later. <em>Everyone</em> could shift their entire sleep schedule forward, maybe. But also...</p><p><strong>People Are Different</strong> – <em>Some</em> of people&#x27;s needs are cultural. But some are biological, and some needs are maybe due to environmental factors that happened over decades and can&#x27;t be changed on a dime.</p><p>Some people do better with rules and structure. Some people flourish more with flexibility. Some people need rules and structure but <em>different</em> rules and structure than other people.</p><p>This all makes it fairly hard to coordinate on norms.</p><hr class=""dividerBlock""/><h2>Contenders for Change</h2><p>Given the above, I think it makes most sense to:</p><ul><li>Look for opportunities explore norms and technology-use at the level of individuals, households, and small organizations (these seem like natural clusters with small numbers of stakeholders, where you can either get consensus or have a dictator).</li><li>While doing so, choose norms that are locally stable, that don&#x27;t require additional cooperation outside yourself, your household or your org. </li></ul><p>For example, I could imagine an entire household trying out a rule, like &quot;the household internet turns off at 10pm&quot;, or &quot;all the lights turn reddish at night so it&#x27;s easier to get to sleep&quot;</p><p></p>",,Raemon,raemon,Raemon

quJ2MigNEWYQ4n2XY,The Politics of Age (the Young vs. the Old),the-politics-of-age-the-young-vs-the-old,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/quJ2MigNEWYQ4n2XY/the-politics-of-age-the-young-vs-the-old,2019-03-24T06:40:04.359Z,16,7,17,False,False,,"<div> <p>Few days ago I've read an article in the local newspaper about Switzerland considering to lower the voting age to 16.</p> <p>The reason I found it interesting was that it was not one of the old tired political discussions supported by the same old tired arguments that you typically encounter. In fact, it's a question that I have never thought of before.</p> <p>Apparently, the discussion was triggered by the recent <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_strike_for_climate"">school strike for climate</a> that went quite big in Switzerland. I've attended the demonstration in Zurich and it was not only big, it was really a kids' event. You could spot a grown-up here and there but they were pretty rare. (Btw, I think this movement is worth watching. Here, for the first time, I see a coordination on truly global level. It spans beyong western countries, with events being hosted in <a href=""https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?actionButton=1&amp;mid=1xsUCSYLnm8d6iFJ2Mt7_kAlv9xULqRQf&amp;ll=31.101377133260886%2C-61.019754800000044&amp;z=2"">Asia, Pacific Islands, South America or Africa</a>.)</p> <p>Anyway, the main argument for lowering the voting age is to counter-balance the greying of the electorate.</p> <p>Once again, this stems from what the climate stikers say: ""The politicians who decide on these issues will be dead by the time the shit hits the fan. It will be us who'll have to deal with it. We should have a say in the matter.""</p> <p>But the question is broader: As the demographics change, with the birth rates dropping at crazy speed (China's population will start shrinking not that far in the future; Sub-saharan fartility rates had plummeted from <a href=""https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN?locations=ZG"">6.8 in 1970's to 4.85 in 2015</a>), the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_pyramid"">age pyramid</a> is going to look less like a pyramid and more like a column or even a funnel. In such a case the old will hold a much larger amount of political power than they do today.</p> <p>While that may seem like a minor thing (everyone is young at some point and old later on) just consider how it would affect the politics of, say, pensions or health-care.</p> <p>Or, for that matter, I hear that Brexit wouldn't happen is 16- and 17-year olds were allowed to vote.</p> <p>More questions:</p> <p>With old people being generally more conservative are we going to see slowing or even reversal of the seemingly instoppable move to the political left that was going on for decades?</p> <p>With high percentage of young males being <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_pyramid#Youth_bulge_phenomenon"">often blamed</a> for social unrest and wars, is the changing shape of the age pyramid going to result in even more political stability? And how is giving teenagers a vote going to affect that?</p> <p>I have no answers but the topic is definitely worth thinking about.</p> <p>(Btw, the voting age was <a href=""https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/glarus-decides-to-grant-vote-from-16/245124"">lowered to 16</a> in canton Glarus in 2007, so there's more than a decade of data to analyse the impact of the measure.)</p> <p><strong>March 24th, 2019</strong></p> </div> <p>by <a href=""http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/martin-sustrik""><img src=""http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=939&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1553409600"" /></a><a href=""http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/martin-sustrik"">martin_sustrik</a></p>",,sustrik,sustrik,Martin Sustrik

There are further supporting details which I can explain if anyone asks, but I didn't want to overload you guys with too much information at once, since a lot of those additional supporting details would require articles of their own to explain.</p><p>One of my friends, who I shall not name, came up with what we <em>think </em>is also a proof, but it's longer and more detailed and he hasn't decided whether to post it.</p><p>I haven't had time yet to extract my own less detailed version from the narrative dialogue of my story, but I thought it was really important that I share it here as soon as possible, since if I'm right, the more time wasted on AI research, the less time we have to come up with strategies and solutions that could more effectively prevent x-risk long term.</p><br><p><strong>Author's note 2:</strong></p><p>This post was originally more strongly worded, but I edited it to tone it down a little. While those who have read <em><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/oLGCcbnvabyibnG9d"">Inadequate Equilibria</a> </em>might consider that to be ""epistemic humility"" and therefore darkside epistemology, I'm worried not enough people on here will have read that book. Furthermore, the human brain, particularly system 1, evolved to win political arguments in the ancestral environment. I'm not sure system 1 is biologically capable of understanding the fact that epistemic humility is bad epistemology. And the contents of this post are likely to provoke strong emotional reactions, as it postulates that a particular belief is false, a belief which rationalists at large have invested a LOT of energy, resources and reputation into. I feel more certain that the contents of this post are correct than is wise to express in a context likely to trigger strong emotions. Please keep this in mind. I'm being upfront with you about exactly what I'm doing and why.</p><br><p><strong>Author's note 3:</strong></p><p>Also, <strong>HEAVY SPOILERS </strong>for the story I've been writing, <u><em>Earthlings: People of the Dawn</em></u>. This chapter is literally the last chapter of part 5, after which the remaining parts are basically extended epilogues. You have been warned. Also, I edited the chapter in response to the comments to make things more clear.</p><p>-------</p><p><strong>Unsolvable</strong></p><p>There were guards standing outside the entrance to the Rationality Institute. They saluted Bertie as he approached. Bertie nodded to them as he walked past. He reached the front doors and turned the handle, then pulled the door open.</p><p>He stepped inside. There was no one at the front desk. All the lights were on, but he didn’t hear anyone in the rooms he passed as he walked down the hallway, approaching the door at the end.</p><p>He finally stood before it. It was the door to Thato’s office.</p><p>Bertie knocked.</p><p>“Come in,” he heard Thato say from the other side.</p><p>Bertie turned the knob with a sweaty hand and pushed inwards. He stepped inside, hoping that whatever Thato wanted to talk to him about, that it wasn’t an imminent existential threat.</p><p>“Hello Bertie,” said Thato, somberly. He looked sweaty and tired, with bags under his puffy red eyes. Had he been <em>crying</em>?</p><p>“Hi Thato,” said Bertie, gently shutting the door behind him. He pulled up a chair across from Thato’s desk. “What did you want to talk to me about?”</p><p>“We finished analyzing the research notes on the chip you gave us two years ago,” said Thato, dully.</p><p>“And?” asked Bertie. “What did you find?”</p><p>“It was complicated, it took us a long time to understand it,” said Thato. “But there was a proof in there that the value alignment problem is <em>unsolvable.”</em></p><p>There was a pause, as Bertie’s brain tried not to process what it had just heard. Then…</p><p>“WHAT!?” Berite shouted.</p><p>“We should have realized it earlier,” said Thato. Then in an accusatory tone, “In fact, I think <em>you </em>should have realized it earlier.”</p><p>“What!?” demanded Bertie. “How? Explain!”</p><p>“The research notes contained a reference to a children's story you wrote:<a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/wtcrocc8tyQFb2FoR/a-tale-of-four-moralities""> <em><u>A Tale of Four Moralities,</u></em></a><em>” </em>Thato continued, his voice rising.<em> “</em>It explained what you <em>clearly </em>already knew when you wrote it, that there are actually <em>FOUR </em>types of morality, each of which has a different game-theoretic function in human society: Eye for an Eye, the Golden Rule, Maximize Flourishing and Minimize Suffering.”</p><p>“Yes,” said Bertie. “And how does one go from that to <em>‘the Value Alignment problem is unsolvable’</em>?”</p><p>“Do you not see it!?” Thato demanded.</p><p>Bertie shook his head.</p><p>Thato stared at Bertie, dumbfounded. Then he spoke slowly, as if to an idiot.</p><p>“Game theory describes how agents with <em>competing goals or values </em>interact with each other. If morality is game-theoretic by nature, that means it is inherently designed for <em>conflict resolution </em>and either maintaining or achieving the universal conditions which help facilitate conflict resolution for all agents. In other words, the whole purpose of morality is to make it so that agents with <em>competing </em>goals or values can coexist peacefully! It is somewhat more complicated than that, but that is the gist.”</p><p>“I see,” said Bertie, his brows furrowed in thought. “Which means that human values, or at least the individual non-morality-based values don’t converge, which means that you can’t design an artificial superintelligence that contains a term for <em>all </em>human values, just the moral values.”</p><p>Then Bertie had a sinking, horrified feeling accompanied by a frightening intuition. He didn’t want to believe it.</p><p>“Not quite,” said Thato cuttingly. “Have you still not realized? Do you need me to spell it out?”</p><p>“Hold on a moment,” said Bertie, trying to calm his racing anxiety.</p><p><em>What is true is already so, </em>Bertie thought.</p><p><em>Owning up to it doesn’t make it worse.</em></p><p><em>Not being open about it doesn’t make it go away.</em></p><p><em>And because it’s true, it is what is there to be interacted with.</em></p><p><em>People can stand what is true, for they are already enduring it.</em></p><p>Bertie took a deep breath as he continued to recite in his mind…</p><p><em>If something is true, then I want to believe it is true.</em></p><p><em>If something is not true, then I want not to believe it is true.</em></p><p><em>Let me not become attached to beliefs I may not want.</em></p><p>Bertie exhaled, still overwhelmingly anxious. But he knew that putting off the revelations any longer would make it even <em>harder </em>to have them. He knew the thought he could not think would control him more than the thought he could. And so he turned his mind in the direction it was afraid to look.</p><p>And the epiphanies came pouring out. It was a stream of consciousness, no--a <em>waterfall </em>of consciousness that wouldn’t stop. Bertie went from one logical step to the next, a nearly perfect dance of rigorously trained self-honesty and common sense--imperfect only in that he had waited so long to start it, to <em>notice</em>.</p><p>“So you can’t program an intelligence to be compatible with <em>all </em>human values, only human <em>moral </em>values,” Bertie said in a rush. “Except even if you programmed it to only be compatible with human <em>moral </em>values, there are four types of morality, so you’d have four separate and competing utility functions to program into it. And if you did that, the intelligence would self-edit to resolve the inconsistencies between its goals and that would just cause it to optimize for conflict resolution, and then it would just tile the universe with tiny artificial conflicts between artificial agents for it to resolve as quickly and efficiently as possible without letting those agents do <em>anything </em>themselves.”</p><p>“Right in one,” said Thato with a grimace. “And as I am sure you already know, turning a human into a superintelligence would not work either. Human values are not sufficiently stable. Yuuto deduced in his research that human values are instrumental all the way down, never terminal. Some values are merely more or less instrumental than others. That is why human values are over patterns of experiences, which are four-dimensional <em>processes</em>, rather than over individual destinations, which are three-dimensional <em>end states</em>. This is a natural implication of the fact that humans are adaptation executors rather than fitness maximizers. If you program a superintelligence to protect humans from death, grievous injury or other forms of extreme suffering without infringing on their self-determination, that superintelligence would by definition have to stay out of human affairs under most circumstances, only intervening to prevent atrocities like murder, torture or rape, or to deal with the occasional existential threat and so on. If the superintelligence was a modified human it would eventually go mad with boredom and loneliness, and it would <em>snap.</em>”</p><p>Thato continued. “On the other hand, if a superintelligence was artificially designed it could not be programmed to do that either. Intelligences are by their very nature optimization processes. Humans typically do not realize that because we each have many optimization criteria which often conflict with each other. You cannot program a general intelligence with a fundamental drive to ‘not intervene in human affairs except when things are about to go drastically wrong otherwise, where drastically wrong is defined as either rape, torture, involuntary death, extreme debility, poverty or existential threats’ because that is not an optimization function.”</p><p>“So, to summarize,” Bertie began, slowly. “The very concept of an omnibenevolent god is a contradiction in terms. It doesn’t correspond to anything that could exist in any self-consistent universe. It is logically impossible.”</p><p>“Hindsight is twenty-twenty, is it not?” asked Thato rhetorically.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>“So what now?” asked Bertie.</p><p>“What now?” repeated Thato. “Why, now I am going to spend all of my money on frivolous things, consume copious amounts of alcohol, say anything I like to anyone without regard for their feelings or even safety or common sense, and wait for the end. Eventually, likely soon, some <em>twit</em> is going to build a God, or blow up the world in any number of other ways. That is all. It is over. We <em>lost.”</em></p><p>Bertie stared at Thato. Then in a quiet, dangerous voice he asked, “Is that all? Is that why you sent me a message saying that you urgently wanted to meet with me in private?”</p><p>“Surely you see the benefit of doing so?” asked Thato. “Now you no longer will waste any more time on this fruitless endeavor. You too may relax, drink, be merry and wait for the end.”</p><p>At this point Bertie was seething. In a deceptively mild tone he asked, “Thato?”</p><p>“Yes?” asked Thato.</p><p>“May I have permission to slap you?”</p><p>“Go ahead,” said Thato. “It does not matter anymore. Nothing does.”</p><p>Bertie leaned over the desk and slapped Thato across the face, hard.</p><p>Thato seized Bertie’s wrist and twisted it painfully.</p><p>“That bloody hurt, you git!”</p><p>“I thought you said nothing matters!?” Bertie demanded. “Yet it clearly matters to you whether you’re slapped.”</p><p>Thato released Bertie’s wrist and looked away. Bertie massaged his wrist, trying to make the lingering sting go away.</p><p>""Are you done being an idiot?"" he asked.</p><p>""Define 'idiot',"" said Thato scathingly, still not looking at him.</p><p>""You know perfectly well what I mean,"" said Bertie.</p><p>Thato ignored him.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Bertie clenched his fists.</p><p>“In the letter Yuuto gave me before he died, he told me that the knowledge contained in that chip could spell Humanity’s victory or its defeat,” he said angrily, eyes blazing with determination. “Do you get it? Yuuto thought his research could either destroy <em>or save </em>humankind. He wouldn’t have given it to me if he didn’t think it could help. So I <em>suggest </em>you and your staff get back to analyzing it. We can figure this out, and we <em>will</em>.”</p><p>Bertie turned around and stormed out of the office.</p><p>He did not look back.</p>",,Sailor Vulcan,sailor-vulcan,Sailor Vulcan

That lesson is extremely important, so all the adults here should pay attention too. I&#x27;ll explain more of the  nitty  gritty details of the underlying theory behind it later.</p><p>----------</p><p>Ivan was very angry.<br/>His teddy was stolen.<br/><br/>Ivan decided.<br/>He would catch the thief and steal from them.<br/><br/>&quot;This will pay them back,&quot; said Ivan. &quot;Serves them right.&quot;<br/><br/>Goldie was very happy.<br/>It was her birthday.<br/>Her papa gave her a teddy.<br/><br/>Goldie decided.<br/>She would give a gift to her papa in return.<br/><br/>&quot;It was nice of him to give me a teddy,&quot; said Goldie.<br/>&quot;This is the least I can do.&quot;<br/><br/>The next day, her teddy was gone.<br/><br/>Minnie was very sad. Someone was stealing teddies from her friends.<br/>She looked at her teddy.<br/>Would she be next?<br/><br/>Minnie decided. She would find the stolen teddies.<br/>And she would return them.<br/><br/>&quot;It&#x27;s the right thing to do,&quot; said Minnie.<br/>&quot;This way, no one will be missing their teddies. Not anymore.&quot;<br/><br/>The next day, her teddy was gone.<br/><br/>Maxie felt guilty, but hopeful.<br/>Earlier, his mama told him something sad.<br/><br/>&quot;The other neighborhood is poor.<br/>Kids there don&#x27;t have teddies.&quot;<br/><br/>So Maxie decided.<br/>He would steal teddies from his friends. He would give them to the other neighborhood.<br/><br/>&quot;It&#x27;s the best thing I can do,&quot; said Maxie. &quot;My friends can afford new teddies. But the poor kids can&#x27;t.&quot;<br/><br/>So Maxie stole teddies from his friends,<br/>and gave them to the other neighborhood.<br/><br/>This made the kids there happy.<br/>But his friends were sad, because now THEY had no teddies.<br/><br/>The next day,<br/>the sad kids went with their parents to the teddy store,<br/>to buy them new teddies.<br/>But the store was all sold out of teddies.<br/><br/>&quot;It&#x27;s been hard to sell teddies in this town,&quot; said the store clerk. &quot;Many poor people can&#x27;t afford them. And many rich people already have teddies.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Why not give teddies to the poor?<br/>For free?&quot; asked Maxie.<br/><br/>&quot;We tried that before,&quot; said the clerk.<br/>&quot;It didn&#x27;t work.<br/>A long line of people came for teddies.<br/>Many poor people can&#x27;t afford cars.<br/>When they got here, they were last in line. Then they got to the front of the line.<br/>But by then, we were out of teddies.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Then why give teddies to the rich?&quot; asked Minnie.<br/>&quot;Can&#x27;t you tell them no?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Other rich people paid us to give teddies for free.<br/>They can&#x27;t do that all the time.<br/><br/>&quot;We have to sell to the rich, too.<br/>Otherwise, we can&#x27;t afford to make teddies.<br/><br/>&quot;At all.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Why not?&quot; asked Goldie.<br/><br/>&quot;We have to pay for the stuff to make the teddy,&quot; said the clerk.<br/><br/>&quot;Why can&#x27;t you just get that stuff for free?&quot; asked Maxie.<br/>&quot;Then you could give teddies, without being paid.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Maxie,&quot; said Maxie&#x27;s mama. &quot;There aren&#x27;t enough teddies for everyone.<br/>There isn&#x27;t enough stuff to make that many.&quot;<br/><br/>Maxie began to cry.<br/>&quot;I wanted to make more people happier,&quot; he said.<br/>&quot;I thought by giving teddies to poor kids, I could make more of the town happier. There are more kids in the poor neighborhood.<br/>And they had no teddies.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;YOU stole our teddies!&quot; Ivan accused. &quot;You should be punished.<br/>Someone should steal a teddy from you.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;m sorry!&quot; said Maxie.<br/>&quot;I don&#x27;t have any teddies.<br/>I gave them to the kids in the other neighborhood.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Maybe if you asked nicely, they would return our teddies?&quot; asked Goldie.<br/><br/>&quot;No,&quot; said Minnie.<br/>&quot;They would feel the same way we did, when the teddies were stolen from us.<br/>They don&#x27;t know the teddies were stolen.<br/>If we tell them, they won&#x27;t know we&#x27;re telling the truth.&quot;<br/><br/>No one was sure what to do.<br/><br/>Finally, Maxie said,<br/>&quot;We need to find a way to make more stuff.<br/>That way, there will be enough to make teddies for everyone.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And if we can&#x27;t do that?&quot; asked Minnie.<br/><br/>&quot;I don&#x27;t know,&quot; said Maxie.<br/>&quot;But we have to try!&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Why should we help everyone?<br/>The poor kids have never helped us,&quot; said Goldie.<br/><br/>&quot;What else can we do?&quot; asked Minnie. &quot;We can&#x27;t steal the teddies back.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The poor kids didn&#x27;t do anything wrong!&quot; said Ivan. &quot;We shouldn&#x27;t punish them!&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Maybe if we find a way to make more stuff,&quot; said Maxie.<br/>&quot;the poor kids will have enough to give you something, in return.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Okay,&quot; said Goldie. &quot;I&#x27;ll help.&quot;<br/><br/>The kids talked.<br/><br/>The parents looked at each other.<br/><br/>&quot;Do you think they can do it?&quot; asked Goldie&#x27;s papa.<br/><br/>Ivan&#x27;s mama laughed.<br/>She thought it was a joke.<br/><br/>Minnie&#x27;s papa sighed sadly.<br/><br/>And Maxie&#x27;s mama turned to the kids and said:</p><p><br/><em>&quot;If you&#x27;re kind and just,<br/>understanding and giving.<br/>If you listen to each other, and to others.<br/>If you work hard and do your best.<br/>If you learn, grow and become stronger.<br/>If you are brave, and never give up.<br/>Then, maybe, you will find a way.&quot;</em><br/><br/>They would find a way to make more stuff.

Review of Prisoners Dilemma</h1><p>Prisoners Dilemma is a class of two player games which can represent for example mutual beneficial cooperation, or the tragedy of the commons.

Further more the payoffs haved to fulfill the following:</p><ul><li>Holding my action constant it is better for me if you cooperate.</li><li>Holding your action constant, it is better for me if I defect.</li><li>Cooperate-cooperate is Pareto optimal (even when including mixed strategies).</li></ul><p>Example of a payout matrix for Prisoners Dilemma:</p><div><style>.mjx-chtml {display: inline-block; line-height: 0; text-indent: 0; text-align: left; text-transform: none; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 100%; font-size-adjust: none; letter-spacing: normal; word-wrap: normal; word-spacing: normal; white-space: nowrap; float: none; direction: ltr; max-width: none; max-height: none; min-width: 0; min-height: 0; border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 1px 0}

Explanation of Game of Chicken by comparing it to Prisoners Dilemma</h1><p>Just like Prisoners Dilemma, Game of Chicken is a two player game, where each player can choose between two actions. These actions are typically called &quot;swerve&quot; and &quot;straight&quot;, but in this blog post I will instead call the two actions &quot;cooperate&quot; and &quot;defect&quot; as to more easily compare with Prisoners Dilemma.</p><p>Also the same as Prisoners Dilemma: In Game of Chicken, I get the best payout if I defect and you cooperate (and vice versa). The difference is that conditional on you defecting, it is better for me if i cooperate.</p><p>A two action, two player game is a Game of Chicken if:</p><ul><li>Holding my action constant it is better for me if you cooperate.</li><li>If you cooperate it is better for me if I defect.</li><li>If you defect is better for me to cooperate.</li><li>Cooperate-cooperate is Pareto optimal (even when including mixed strategies).</li></ul><p>Furthermore, defect-defect is traditionally super bad for both players. But I would not say that this is a necessary condition for something to be a Game of Chicken.</p><p>Example payoff matrix:</p><div><span class=""mjx-chtml MJXc-display"" style=""text-align: center;""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\begin{array}{c|c|c|}

If the blackmailed player doesn&#x27;t give in the blackmailer will carry out the threat which is costing both players ten utility. If the the blackmailer doesn&#x27;t actually blackmails, than nothing happens.</p><p>Compare this to the example payout matrix of Game of Chicken. The blackmail payout matrix is not exactly the same, but I claim that in essence this is the same game. If you can handle Game of Chicken then you can handle blackmail both as the blackmailer and the blackmailed. </p><p>Not all blackmail is a Game of Chicken. If there is not cost in carrying out the threat then we are in a different type of situation. However I expect this to be rare. It seems unlikely to me that there is no opportunity cost at all in carrying out the threat. Further more, even if costless threats exists in some situations this does not invalidate the argument for considering those blackmail situation where there is a cost to the blackmailer to carryout the threat.</p><p>If the blackmailer gains utility by carrying out the threat then I would argue that it is not exactly blackmail anymore. If I have an action that I can take that would help me but hurt you and I ask you for some compensation for refraining from taking this action, then this is more like a value trade than a blackmail.</p><h1>4. Why we should care about blackmail/Game of Chicken</h1><p>Prisoners Dilemma receives a lot of attention because this class of games represents an important type of situation in most multiplayer environments. I claim that this is also true for Game of Chicken.</p><p>In any situation where one agent (A) has the ability to use up some of its own resources to impose a cost on another agent (B), then A can choose to blackmail B, thus creating a Game of Chicken like situation. And if A thinks that it can win this game, then it will be tempted to engage in blackmail.</p><p>If you expect that:</p><ul><li>It is important to build AI&#x27;s that can act well in multi-agent situations (e.g. because there will be several simultaneous AIs that are similarly powerful, or there will be acausal trade and threats between agents in different universes simulating each other) </li></ul><p>and</p><ul><li>Toy model such as Prisoners Dilemma are useful</li></ul><p>then you should also care about Game of Chicken.</p><h1>5.

It&#x27;s a subjective rating system from 1 to 10, and looks something like</p><blockquote>1. can’t do anything, even reading. Worktime 0%.</blockquote><blockquote>2. can force myself to read or work, but I can barely parse anything. Worktime 5%.</blockquote><blockquote>...</blockquote><blockquote>5. I don’t want to work and am easily distracted, but I’m getting stuff done. 50%</blockquote><blockquote>6. Some mild distractions, but I can stick to a pomodoro timer. Worktime 60%. </blockquote><blockquote>...</blockquote><blockquote>10. Insane art-level hyperfocus. Worktime 100%. </blockquote><p>At the end of each workday I would record how well I thought I&#x27;d done by this scale.</p><p>I&#x27;d been dissatisfied with this for a while – there was no way my brain was accurately tracking what percentage of time I was working, these descriptions are not well defined, don&#x27;t cleanly map to some level of productivity. I can&#x27;t prevent internal mapping drift, where my standards slowly rise or fall, such that a day I mark as productivity=4 this week is actually much more productive than a day I marked at 4  several years ago.</p><p>I&#x27;m invested in having good measurements, because I&#x27;ve been iterating on antidepressants and ADD meds for years, and having data on which ones are working on what metrics (I also track mood, exercise, sleep, social time) would be very useful for having a better life.</p><p>So I wrote a small Python script that tracked how much time I spent working at my job. Every time I took a break or went back to work, I&#x27;d mark it. If I noticed I&#x27;d started working during breaktime or zoning out during worktime, I&#x27;d &#x27;revert&#x27; however many minutes I thought it had been to be of the other type. I also had &#x27;dead&#x27; time where I wasn&#x27;t getting anything done for reasons unrelated to my productivity, which I used to mark meetings or lunch breaks. At the end of the session, it would spit out a summary of how much time I&#x27;d spent working vs resting. This was a much more accurate, quantitative way of measuring what I wanted, or so I thought. I used it for a month and a week before I stopped.</p><p>Here&#x27;s why I quit it.</p><ul><li>As is frequently the case, using part of a system to monitor that system changes that system enough that the output of the monitoring is less useful. On bad attention days, I would be switching back and forth between work every two minutes. The work/break context switches were costlier, and seeing how short my work periods were lowered my mood.</li><li>The varying difficulty of tasks threw off the measurement. Some days I&#x27;d have monotonous but easy work, sometimes I&#x27;d have one tricky complicated thing that took a lot of brainpower and persistence. When I was using the subjective scale, I&#x27;d adjust my score for perceived task-easiness. But when I was using the time tracker, a day that was spent on &quot;going through the codebase and adjusting every method call to do a new thing&quot; would be logged as productive, even though I could have done that on that even on a bad day.</li><li>My personal productivity scale ranged between 0% and 100% productivity, and my ratings usually fall between 2 (subjective 5% work time) to 6 (60%). But my time-tracked work time usually hovered around 50%. I have an internal sense of &quot;I haven&#x27;t done enough work, I really need to do something&quot; that kicks in and makes me do work-like activities badly, slowly, and ineffectively. For example, I&#x27;ll read some documentation, staring at one sentence at a time, forcing myself to process it before moving onto the next one. That counts as work by the tracker time -- I&#x27;m certainly not resting -- and I can fill half my workday with that. At the end, the tracker will say I worked 50% of the time, but my subjective scale would say it was a 2. And I think my subjective scale is more correct.</li></ul><p>I considered the idea of rating work periods every time I ended one, so that after spending an hour laboriously shoving sentences against my eyeballs, I&#x27;d indicate to the program that &quot;taking break now; also, that last work period was only 10% of a real work period&quot;. But that goes right back to the problem of subjectively rated work, plus adds to the already-painful overhead I described in point 1.</p><p>That was an interesting lesson to learn. In the future, when I&#x27;m trying to measure something, I&#x27;ll try to ask myself</p><ul><li>How will integrating monitoring into my system change my system?</li><li>Describe a day that the proposed monitoring system would give a high score, but actually should have a bad score. How common do you expect these days to be?</li><li> Describe a day that would get a low score should have a high score, etc.</li><li> How much overhead do you expect this to add?</li></ul>",,femtogrammar,yuye,Yuye

Over time, we generally expect programming to become more declarative, as more of the details are left to the compiler/interpreter. Good examples include the transition to automated memory management and, more recently, high-level tools for concurrent/parallel programming.</p><p>It’s hard to say what programming languages will look like in twenty or fifty years, but it’s a pretty safe bet that they’ll be a lot more declarative.</p><p>I expect that applied mathematics will also become much more declarative, for largely the same reasons: as computers grow in power and software expands its reach, there will be less and less need for (most) humans to worry about the details of rote computation.</p><p>What does this look like? Well, let’s start with a few examples of “imperative” mathematics:</p><ul><li>Most grade-school arithmetic: it’s explicitly focused on computation, and even spells out the exact steps to follow (e.g. long division).</li><li>Gaussian reduction, as typically taught in a first-semester linear algebra class. It’s the undergrads’ version of grade-school arithmetic.</li><li>Most of the computation performed by hand in physics, engineering and upper-level econ courses &amp; research, i.e. algebra/DEs/PDEs.</li></ul><p>Contrast to the declarative counterparts:</p><ul><li>Figure out what arithmetic needs to be done (i.e. what numbers to plug in) and then use a calculator</li><li>Set up a system of linear equations, then have python or wolfram invert the matrix</li><li>Choose which phenomena to include in a model, set up the governing equations, then use either numerical simulation (for pretty graphs) or a computer algebra system (for asymptotics and scaling relations).</li></ul><p>In the declarative case, most of the work is in formulating the problem, figuring out what questions to ask, and translating it all into a language which a computer can work with - numbers, or matrices, or systems of equations.</p><p>This is all pretty standard commentary at the level of mathematics education, but the real importance is in shaping the <em>goals</em> of applied mathematics. For the past century, the main objectives of mathematical research programs would be things like existence &amp; uniqueness, or exhaustive classification of some objects, or algorithms for solving some problem (a.k.a. constructive solution/proof). With the shift toward declarative mathematics, there will be more focus on <em>building declarative frameworks</em> for solving various kinds of problems.</p><p>The best example I know of is convex analysis, in the style taught by Stephen Boyd (<u><a href=""https://see.stanford.edu/Course/EE364A"">course</a></u>, <u><a href=""https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/bv_cvxbook.pdf"">book</a></u>). Boyd’s presentation is the user’s guide to convex optimization: it addresses what kinds of questions can be asked/answered, how to recognize relevant applications in the wild, how to formulate problems, what guarantees are offered in terms of solutions, and of course a firehose of examples from a wide variety of fields. In short, it includes exactly the pieces needed to use the tools of convex analysis as a declarative framework. By contrast, the internals of optimization algorithms are examined only briefly, with little depth and a focus on things which a user might need to tweak. Complicated proofs are generally omitted altogether, the relevant results simply stated as tools available for use.</p><p>This is what a mature declarative mathematical framework looks like: it provides a set of tools for practitioners to employ on practical problems. Users don’t need to know what’s going on under the hood; the algorithms and proofs generally “just work” without the user needing to worry about the details. The user’s job is to understand the language of the framework, the interface, and translate their own problems into that language. Once they’ve expressed what they want, the tools take over and handle the rest.</p><p>That’s the big goal of future mathematical disciplines: provide a practical framework which practitioners can use to solve real-world problems in the wild, without having to know all the little details and gotchas under the hood.</p><p>One last example, which is particularly relevant to me and to ML/AI research. One of the overarching goals of probability/statistics/ML is to be able to code up a generative model, pass it into a magical algorithm, and get back parameter estimates and uncertainties. The “language” of generative models is very intuitive and generally easy to work with, making it an excellent interface to a declarative mathematical toolkit. Unfortunately, the behind-the-scenes part of the toolkit remains relatively finicky and inefficient. As of today, the “magical algorithm” part is usually MCMC, which is great in terms of universality but often super-exponentially slow for multimodal problems, especially in high dimensions, and can converge very slowly even in simple unimodal problems. It’s not really reliable enough to use without thinking about what’s under the hood. Better mathematical tools and guarantees are needed before this particular framework fully matures.</p><p>If anyone has other examples of maturing or up-and-coming declarative mathematical frameworks, I’d be very interested to hear about them.</p>",,johnswentworth,johnswentworth,johnswentworth

Although the research shows little evidence of effectiveness, this technique (Alex Faickney Osborn, 1957) has persisted in practice. More specifically, brainstorming instructions increase the number of ideas in a group but are usually less than the total number of ideas generated by the same number of brainstorming individuals alone (Brown and Paulus, 1996).</p>
<p>The instructions for brainstorming are fairly precise:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quantity: come up with as many ideas as you can.</li>
<li>Do not criticise others’ ideas.</li>
<li>Build on others’ ideas.</li>
<li>Freewheeling is welcome.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not to criticise each others’ idea is an admonition as it may cause evaluation apprehension: people will be reluctant to express creative ideas; they won’t <em>freewheel</em> for fear of evaluation and risk.</p>
<p>We’re traditionally taught that the criticism inherent to analysis is a no-go in the process of <em>ideation</em>: the second rule of brainstorming is <em>don’t criticise</em>. The absence of criticism is supposed to set free creativity but as it happens, the human mind is not a creative volcano waiting for an excuse to erupt.</p>
<p>Charlan Nemeth, a professor of psychology at the University of California, demonstrated that people are not very creative when they are given complete freedom. As part of an experiment on word association, she asked people to associate freely on the word <em>blue,</em> the vast majority said first <em>green,</em> then <em>sky</em> or <em>ocean.</em> Her research shows that people are able to generate both a larger number of associations and more creative associations when faced with dissent and criticism.</p>
<p>As part of the aforementioned experiment, Nemeth placed her test subjects alongside actors posing as test subjects who would disagree on established truths like what colour an object is. It turned out that the test subjects confronted with the <em>dissenting</em> actors had much more creative associations than the test subjects in the group without actors. Rather than associating <em>blue</em> with <em>green, sky,</em> or <em>ocean,</em> they associated <em>blue</em> with words like <em>berry pie.</em> Instead of killing creativity, disagreement seems to foster it.</p>
<p>In dire straits, analysis becomes an essential tool to understand what is going on in the world and help evaluate existing ideas—it is also a catalyst of the creativity needed to come up with solutions.</p>
<p>Analysis injects dissent and criticism into the ideation process, and contrary to what the rules of brainstorming tell us, this makes people more, not less, creative.</p>

<p>It occurs to me that if the overseer understands everything that the ML model (that it’s training) is doing, and the training is via some kind of local optimization algorithm like gradient descent, the overseer is essentially manually programming the ML model by gradually nudging it from some initial (e.g., random) point in configuration space.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No one answered my comments with either a confirmation or denial, as to whether these guesses of how to understand Universality / Informed Oversight and IDA are correct. I'm surfacing this question as a top-level post because if ""Informed Oversight = reverse engineering"" and ""IDA = programming by nudging"" are good analogies for understanding Informed Oversight and IDA, it seems to have pretty significant implications.</p>
<p>In particular it seems to imply that there's not much hope for IDA to be competitive with ML-in-general, because if IDA is analogous to a highly constrained method of ""manual"" programming, that seems unlikely to be competitive with less constrained methods of ""manual"" programming (i.e., AIs designing and programming more advanced AIs in more general ways, similar to how humans do most programming today), which itself is presumably not competitive with general (unconstrained-by-safety) ML (otherwise ML would not be the competitive benchmark).</p>

Those were primarily about understanding what individual neurons in an image classifer were responding to, and the key idea was to &quot;name&quot; each neuron with the input that would maximally activate that neuron. This can give you a global view of what the network is doing.</p><p>However, such a global view makes it hard to understand the interaction between neurons. To understand these, we can look at a specific input image, and use techniques like attribution. Rather than attribute final classifications to the input, you could attribute classifications to neurons in the network, and then since individual neurons now had meanings (roughly: &quot;fuzzy texture neuron&quot;, &quot;tennis ball neuron&quot;, etc) you can gain insight to how the network is making decisions <em>for that specific input</em>.</p><p>However, ideally we would like to see how the network uses interactions between neurons to make decisions in general; not on a single image. This motivates activation atlases, which analyze the activations of a network on a <em>large dataset</em> of inputs. In particular, for each of a million images, they randomly choose a non-border patch from the image, and compute the activation vector at a particular layer of the network at that patch. This gives a dataset of a million activation vectors. They use standard dimensionality reduction techniques to map each activation vector into an (x, y) point on the 2D plane. They divide the 2D plane into a reasonably sized grid (e.g. 50x50), and for each grid cell they compute the average of all the activation vectors in the cell, visualize that activation vector using feature visualization, and put the resulting image into the grid cell. This gives a 50x50 grid of the &quot;concepts&quot; that the particular neural network layer we are analyzing can reason about. They also use attribution to show, for each grid cell, which class that grid cell most supports.</p><p>The paper then goes into a lot of detail about what we can infer from the activation atlas. For example, we can see that paths in activation vector space can correspond to human-interpretable concepts like the number of objects in an image, or moving from water to beaches to rocky cliffs. If we look at activation atlases for different layers, we can see that the later layers seem to get much more specific and complex, and formed of combinations of previous features (e.g. combining sand and water features to get a single sandbar feature).</p><p>By looking at images for specific classes, we can use attribution to see which parts of an activation atlas are most relevant for the class. By comparing across classes, we can see how the network makes decisions. For example, for fireboats vs. streetcars, the network looks for windows for both, crane-like structures for both (though less than windows), and water for fireboats vs. buildings for streetcars. This sort of analysis can also help us find mistakes in reasoning -- e.g. looking at the difference between grey whales and great white sharks, we can see that the network looks for the teeth and mouth of a great white shark, including an activation that looks suspiciously like a baseball. In fact, if you take a grey whale and put a patch of a baseball in the top left corner, this becomes an adversarial example that fools the network into thinking the grey whale is a great white shark. They run a bunch of experiments with these human-found adversarial examples and find they are quite effective.</p><p><strong>Rohin&#x27;s opinion:</strong> While the authors present this as a method for understanding how neurons interact, it seems to me that the key insight is about looking at and explaining the behavior of the neural network <em>on data points in-distribution</em>. Most possible inputs are off-distribution, and there is not much to be gained by understanding what the network does on these points. Techniques that aim to gain a global understanding of the network are going to be &quot;explaining&quot; the behavior of the network on such points as well, and so will be presenting data that we won&#x27;t be able to interpret. By looking specifically at activations corresponding to in-distribution images, we can ensure that the data we&#x27;re visualizing is in-distribution and is expected to make sense to us.</p><p>I&#x27;m pretty excited that interpretability techniques have gotten good enough that they allow us to construct adversarial examples &quot;by hand&quot; -- that seems like a clear demonstration that we are learning something real about the network. It feels like the next step would be to use interpretability techniques to enable us to actually fix the network -- though admittedly this would require us to also develop methods that allow humans to &quot;tweak&quot; networks, which doesn&#x27;t really fit within interpretability research as normally defined.</p><p><strong>Read more:</strong> <u><a href=""https://openai.com/blog/introducing-activation-atlases/"">OpenAI blog post</a></u> and <u><a href=""https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/03/exploring-neural-networks.html"">Google AI blog post</a></u></p><p><strong><u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.03411"">Feature Denoising for Improving Adversarial Robustness</a></u></strong> <em>(Cihang Xie et al)</em> (summarized by Dan H): This paper claims to obtain nontrivial adversarial robustness on ImageNet. Assuming an adversary can add perturbations of size 16/255 (l_infinity), previous adversarially trained classifiers could not obtain above 1% adversarial accuracy. Some groups have tried to break the model proposed in this paper, but so far it appears its robustness is close to what it claims, <u><a href=""https://github.com/facebookresearch/ImageNet-Adversarial-Training/issues/1#issuecomment-470069171"">around</a></u> 40% adversarial accuracy. Vanilla adversarial training is how they obtain said adversarial robustness. There has only been one previous public attempt at applying (multistep) adversarial training to ImageNet, as those at universities simply do not have the GPUs necessary to perform adversarial training on 224x224 images. Unlike the previous attempt, this paper ostensibly uses better hyperparameters, possibly accounting for the discrepancy. If true, this result reminds us that hyperparameter tuning can be critical even in vision, and that improving adversarial robustness on large-scale images may not be possible outside industry for many years.</p><h1><strong>Technical AI alignment</strong></h1><h3><strong>Learning human intent</strong></h3><p><u><a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01267"">Using Causal Analysis to Learn Specifications from Task Demonstrations</a></u> <em>(Daniel Angelov et al)</em></p><h3><strong>Reward learning theory</strong></h3><p><u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/qezBTig6p6p5xtL6G/a-theory-of-human-values"">A theory of human values</a></u> <em>(Stuart Armstrong)</em>: This post presents an outline of how to construct a theory of human values. First, we need to infer preferences and meta-preferences from humans who are in &quot;reasonable&quot; situations. Then we need to synthesize these into a utility function, by resolving contradictions between preferences, applying meta-preferences to preferences, and having a way of changing the procedures used to do the previous two things. We then need to argue that this leads to adequate outcomes -- he gives some simple arguments for this, that rely on particular facts about humans (such as the fact that they are scope insensitive).</p><h3><strong>Preventing bad behavior</strong></h3><p><u><a href=""https://medium.com/@deepmindsafetyresearch/designing-agent-incentives-to-avoid-side-effects-e1ac80ea6107"">Designing agent incentives to avoid side effects</a></u> <em>(Victoria Krakovna et al)</em>: This blog post provides details about the recent update to the <u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01186"">relative reachability paper</a></u> (<u><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/d1a19c140226/alignment-newsletter-10"">AN #10</a></u>), which is now more a paper about the design choices available with impact measures. There are three main axes that they identify:</p><p>First, what baseline is impact measurede relative to? A natural choice is to compare against the starting state, but this will penalize the agent for environment effects, such as apples growing on trees. We can instead compare against an inaction baseline, i.e. measuring impact relative to what would have happened if the agent did nothing. Unfortunately, this leads to offsetting behavior: the agent first makes a change to get reward, and then undoes the change in order to not be penalized for impact. This motivates the stepwise inaction baseline, which compares each action against what would have happened if the agent did nothing <em>from that step onwards</em>.</p><p>Second, we need a measure by which to compare states. The unreachability measure measures how hard it is to reach the baseline from the current state. However, this &quot;maxes out&quot; as soon as the baseline is unreachability, and so there is no incentive to avoid further irreversible actions. This motivates relative reachability, which computes the set of states reachable from the baseline, and measures what proportion of those states are reachable from the state created by the agent. <u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/yEa7kwoMpsBgaBCgb/towards-a-new-impact-measure"">Attainable utility</a></u> (<u><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/0c5eeec28f75/alignment-newsletter-25"">AN #25</a></u>) generalizes this to talk about the <em>utility</em> that could be achieved from the baseline for a wide range of utility functions. (This is equivalent to relative reachability when the utility functions are of the form &quot;1 if state s is ever encountered, else 0&quot;.)</p><p>Finally, we need to figure how to penalize changes in our chosen measure. Penalizing decreases in the measure allows us to penalize actions that make it harder to do things (what the AUP post calls &quot;opportunity cost&quot;), while penalizing increases in the measure allows us to penalize convergent instrumental subgoals (which almost by definition increase the ability to satisfy many different goals or reach many different states).</p><p><strong>Rohin&#x27;s opinion:</strong> Since the AUP post was published about half a year ago, I&#x27;ve been watching this unification of AUP and relative reachability slowly take form, since they were phrased very differently initially. I&#x27;m glad to see this finally explained clearly and concisely, with experiments showing the effect of each choice. I do want to put special emphasis on the insight of AUP that the pursuit of convergent instrumental subgoals leads to large <em>increases</em> in &quot;ability to do things&quot;, and thus that penalizing increases can help avoid such subgoals. This point doesn&#x27;t typically make it into the academic writings on the subject but seems quite important.</p><p>On the topic of impact measures, I&#x27;ll repeat what I&#x27;ve said before: I think that it&#x27;s hard to satisfy the conjunction of three desiderata -- objectivity (no dependence on human values), safety (preventing any catastrophic outcomes) and usefulness (the AI system is still able to do useful things). Impact measures are very clearly aiming for the first two criteria, but usually don&#x27;t have much to say about the third one. My expectation is that there is a strong tradeoff between the first two criteria and the third one, and impact measures have not dealt with this fact yet, but will have to at some point.</p><p><u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09725"">Conservative Agency via Attainable Utility Preservation</a></u> <em>(Alexander Matt Turner et al)</em>: This paper presents in a more academic format a lot of the content that Alex has published about attainable utility preservation, see <u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/yEa7kwoMpsBgaBCgb/towards-a-new-impact-measure"">Towards a New Impact Measure</a></u> (<u><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/0c5eeec28f75/alignment-newsletter-25"">AN #25</a></u>) and <u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/mDTded2Dn7BKRBEPX/penalizing-impact-via-attainable-utility-preservation"">Penalizing Impact via Attainable Utility Preservation</a></u>(<u><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/036ba834bcaf/alignment-newsletter-39"">AN #39</a></u>).</p><h3><strong>Interpretability</strong></h3><p><strong><u><a href=""https://distill.pub/2019/activation-atlas/"">Exploring Neural Networks with Activation Atlases</a></u></strong> <em>(Shan Carter et al)</em>: Summarized in the highlights!</p><h3><strong>Adversarial examples</strong></h3><p><strong><u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.03411"">Feature Denoising for Improving Adversarial Robustness</a></u></strong> <em>(Cihang Xie et al)</em>: Summarized in the highlights!</p><h3><strong>Forecasting</strong></h3><p><u><a href=""https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSduBjn3W_MpHHjsKUEhzV6Krkup78ujE5-8bpNJ5HDE7GGnmA/viewform?usp=sf_link"">Signup form for AI Metaculus</a></u> <em>(Jacob Lagerros and Ben Goldhaber)</em>: Recently, forecasting platform Metaculus launched a new instance dedicated specifically to AI in order to get good answers for empirical questions (such as AGI timelines) that can help avoid situations like <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/2uDBJWCksvzhDzHGf/understanding-information-cascades"">info-cascades</a></u>.

Proposals like impact measures and corrigibility try to formalize a property that will lead to good outcomes; but any such formalization will be denoting some policies as safe and some as dangerous, and there will always exist a utility function according to which the &quot;safe&quot; policies are catastrophic. Thus, you need to also define a utility function (or a class of them?) that safety is computed with respect to; and designing this is particularly difficult.</p><p><strong>Rohin&#x27;s opinion:</strong> This seems very similar to the problem I have with impact measures, but I wouldn&#x27;t apply that argument to corrigibility. I think the difference might be that I&#x27;m thinking of &quot;natural&quot; things that agents might want, whereas Stuart is considering the entire space of possible utility functions. I&#x27;m not sure what drives this difference.</p><p><u><a href=""https://medium.com/@deepmindsafetyresearch/understanding-agent-incentives-with-causal-influence-diagrams-7262c2512486"">Understanding Agent Incentives with Causal Influence Diagrams</a></u> <em>(Tom Everitt et al)</em>: This post and associated paper model an agent&#x27;s decision process using a causal influence diagram -- think of a Bayes net, and then imagine that you add nodes corresponding to actions and utilities. A major benefit of Bayes nets is that the criterion of d-separation can be used to determine whether two nodes are conditionally independent. Once we add actions and utilities, we can also analyze whether observing or intervening on nodes would lead the agent to achieve higher expected utility. The authors derive criteria resembling d-separation for identifying each of these cases, which they call observation incentives (for nodes whose value the agent would like to know) and intervention incentives (for nodes whose value the agent would like to change). They use observation incentives to show how to analyze whether a particular decision is fair or not (that is, whether it depended on a sensitive feature that should not be used, like gender). Intervention incentives are used to establish the security of <u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05541"">counterfactual oracles</a></u> more simply and rigorously.</p><p><strong>Rohin&#x27;s opinion:</strong> These criteria are theoretically quite nice, but I&#x27;m not sure how they relate to the broader picture. Is the hope that we will be able to elicit the causal influence diagram an AI system is using, or something like it? Or perhaps that we will be able to create a causal influence diagram of the environment, and these criteria can tell us which nodes we should be particularly interested in? Maybe the goal was simply to understand agent incentives better, with the expectation that more knowledge would help in some as-yet-unknown way? None of these seem very compelling to me, but the authors might have something in mind I haven&#x27;t thought of.</p><h1><strong>Other progress in AI</strong></h1><h3><strong>Exploration</strong></h3><p><u><a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.07685"">World Discovery Models</a></u> <em>(Mohammad Gheshlaghi Azar, Bilal Piot, Bernardo Avila Pires et al)</em></p><h3><strong>Reinforcement learning</strong></h3><p><u><a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01599"">Learning Dynamics Model in Reinforcement Learning by Incorporating the Long Term Future</a></u> <em>(Nan Rosemary Ke et al)</em></p><h3><strong>Deep learning</strong></h3><p><u><a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03088"">Self-Tuning Networks: Bilevel Optimization of Hyperparameters using Structured Best-Response Functions</a></u> <em>(Matthew MacKay, Paul Vicol et al)</em></p><h3><strong>Hierarchical RL</strong></h3><p><u><a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01567"">Model Primitive Hierarchical Lifelong Reinforcement Learning</a></u> <em>(Bohan Wu et al)</em></p><h3><strong>Miscellaneous (AI)</strong></h3><p><u><a href=""http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html"">The Bitter Lesson</a></u> <em>(Rich Sutton)</em>: This blog post is controversial. This is a combination summary and opinion, and so is more biased than my summaries usually are.</p><p>Much research in AI has been about embedding human knowledge in AI systems, in order to use the current limited amount of compute to achieve some outcomes. That is, we try to get our AI systems to think the way we think we think. However, this usually results in systems that work currently, but then cannot leverage the increasing computation that will be available. The bitter lesson is that methods like search and learning that can scale to more computation eventually win out, as more computation becomes available. There are many examples that will likely be familiar to readers of this newsletter, such as chess (large scale tree search), Go (large scale self play), image classification (CNNs), and speech recognition (Hidden Markov Models in the 70s, and now deep learning).</p><p>Shimon Whiteson&#x27;s <u><a href=""https://twitter.com/shimon8282/status/1106534178676506624"">take</a></u> is that in reality lots of human knowledge has been important in getting AI to do things; such as the invariances built into convolutional nets, or the MCTS and self-play algorithm underlying AlphaZero. I don&#x27;t see this as opposed to Rich Sutton&#x27;s point -- it seems to me that the takeaway is that we should aim to build algorithms that will be able to leverage large amounts of compute, but we can be clever and embed important knowledge in such algorithms. I think this criterion would have predicted ex-ante (i.e. before seeing the results) that much past and current research in AI was misguided, without also predicting that any of the major advances (like CNNs) were misguided.</p><p>It&#x27;s worth noting that this is coming from a perspective of aiming for the most general possible capabilities for AI systems. If your goal is to instead build something that works reliably now, then it really is a good idea to embed human domain knowledge, as it does lead to a performance improvement -- you should just expect that in time the system will be replaced with a better performing system with less embedded human knowledge.</p><p>One disagreement I have is that this post doesn&#x27;t acknowledge the importance of data. The AI advances we see now are ones where the data has been around for a long time (or you use simulation to get the data), and someone finally put in enough engineering effort + compute to get the data out and put it in a big enough model. That is, currently compute is <u><a href=""https://blog.openai.com/ai-and-compute/"">increasing much faster</a></u> (<u><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/3e550712419a/alignment-newsletter-7"">AN #7</a></u>) than data, so the breakthroughs you see are in domains where the bottleneck was compute and not data; that doesn&#x27;t mean data bottlenecks don&#x27;t exist.</p><h1><strong>News</strong></h1><p><u><a href=""https://www.ai-safety.org/"">AI Safety workshop at IJCAI 2019</a></u> <em>(HuÃ¡scar Espinoza et al)</em>: There will be a workshop on AI safety at IJCAI 2019 in Macao, China; the paper submission deadline is April 12.

To that end, I recently finished working through <em>Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach</em>. Before reading this textbook, I knew a bit about machine learning, but did not know much about search algorithms, knowledge representation, Bayesian networks, or the many many other topic AIMA covers. I found this textbook a useful overview of its field. Below I will talk about a few concepts that I found particularly interesting.</p><h2>Generating heuristics</h2><p>If an algorithm is searching through an action space, it needs some way of deciding how close the possible next states it can reach are to its goal. One way of generating a useful heuristic is to relax some of the limitations on actions. Computing “how hard is it to get from state A to the goal?” takes a lot of work, so instead the algorithm could calculate “how hard would it be to get from state A to the goal if I could do things I cannot?” For example, if you are trying to plan how to coordinate planes, fuel, and cargo to fly various packages where they need to go, you could create a heuristic by ignoring fuel limitations of planes, forming a problem that is easier to solve but still gives information about the true problem. I would expect it to be hard to find relaxed problems that are still close enough to the full problem to give useful heuristics, but in the examples the book gives it seems to work pretty well.</p><h2>Reasons for failure to learn</h2><p>There are a few different reasons a learning algorithm can fail to find the right function: the correct hypothesis might not be in the hypothesis space, the data can be noisy so that perfect prediction from the information that the algorithm has access to is impossible, sample variance can makes the data the algorithm sees unrepresentative of the true distribution, and complexity of the hypothesis space can prevents the algorithm from finding the correct hypothesis. I found this a useful summary of possible barriers to learning.</p><h2>Boosting</h2><p>In boosting, you train an initial classifier, see which data it gets wrong, and then train another classifier by weighting the training samples that the first classifier got wrong more heavily. You do this a few times and then combine the classifiers to make your actual predictions. This gives surprisingly (to me, at least) good performance. If the first classifier gets examples wrong because of noise, adding more classifiers doesn’t seem like it would help, because the new classifiers don’t have any new information. I guess it would help if the first classifier predicted based on the more common samples, while the later classifiers can help improve performance on the more uncommon data points. It could also help if one of the classifiers gets stuck in a bad local minimum.</p>",,swift_spiral,swift_spiral,swift_spiral

Consider this an update to the original comment. </p><p><a href=""http://benjaminrosshoffman.com/sabbath-hard-and-go-home/"">Like Ben Hoffman</a>, I stumbled upon and rediscovered the Sabbath (although my implementation seems different from both Ben and Zvi). I was experiencing burnout at CFAR, and while I wasn&#x27;t able to escape the effects entirely, I found some refuge in the following distinction between Rest Days and Recovery Days.</p><h1>Recovery Days</h1><p>A <strong>Recovery Day</strong> is where you&#x27;re so tired or under-resourced that you can&#x27;t do much of anything with yourself other than: stay in bed / sleep a lot, binge on Netflix or video games, stay in your room all day, play with your phone, use social media, and feel unmotivated to do much except easy, stimulating, and/or mind-numbing things. This is a Recovery Day and does not count as a Rest Day, but it is fine to take the time for them. However you aren&#x27;t going to be refreshed from them. In order to really refresh, you need to take another day that counts as a Rest Day.</p><p>Another way a person might take time off is to do things that are <em>like work</em> but easier. Video games are a prime example. I play a lot of video games that involve optimizing systems, and I find these really motivating and fun. But I notice that this is a kind of &quot;work&quot;—my mind is trying to solve problems and implement solutions. The difference is that because it&#x27;s easy and doable, I get addicted to them, and it&#x27;s a way for me to escape the &quot;real&quot; problems at work, which tend to be harder to solve. This also doesn&#x27;t count as Resting.</p><h1>Rest Days </h1><p><strong>Rest Days</strong> are days where I have enough energy and resources that I feel motivated and able to get out and about. (One way I can tell I have energy is that sometimes I spontaneously feel like cooking, a rare occurrence.) On a Rest Day, your prime directive is to just &quot;follow your gut&quot; for the entire day and just do &quot;what you feel like doing&quot; in the moment. </p><p>There can be no obligations on a Rest Day. No scheduled calls or meetings. No promises to show up to a party. You can go to the party if you actually feel like going to the party, but you won&#x27;t be able to know until last-minute. You cannot be &quot;on-call&quot; for anything. No one should depend on you unless it&#x27;s someone you actively like being depended on for things, like a person you care about.</p><p>There can be exceptions to these, but I like to make Rest Days &quot;sacred&quot;—aka protected from influences like work pressure, social pressure, pressure from society, incentive gradients created by video games and my phone, incentive gradients created by money, the pressure to be different or better, the pressure to achieve, the pressure to always be going somewhere else, the pressure to &quot;always be closing.&quot; </p><p>Rest Days are for being in the Now. The Now needs to be protected from influences from both the past (obligations) and the future (anxieties). </p><hr class=""dividerBlock""/><p>Rest Days will actually refresh and reset you. Unfortunately, many people do not know how to take Rest Days. They instead use weekends and vacation days as Recovery Days or days where their mind is still in &quot;working&quot; mode. But Recovery Days alone are not sufficient for refreshing your energy levels and motivation. You risk burnout if you consistently fail to get any true Rest over a long period of time.</p><p>Things my gut wants to do on Rest Days:</p><li>be in the present moment </li><li>meditate (in a natural, spontaneous way)</li><li>eat tasty things</li><li>have a picnic in a park / take walks / enjoy nature</li><li>chill at a cafe I like</li><li>go to a museum or an aquarium </li><li>draw, dance, sing, improvise poems</li><li>read a book, listen to music</li><li>cook</li><li>spend meaningful social time with friends or family</li><li>useful, engaging errands or home-improvement stuff (not because I have to, because I want to)</li><p>Things my gut rarely wants to do on Rest Days:</p><li>spend a lot of time on Facebook or social media</li><li>binge TV</li><li>play video games</li><li>be in front of a screen in general</li><li>do my job / work stuff</li><li>lie in bed for hours</li><li>eat microwaved food or junk food</li><li>go to social functions, networking events, or any social event where I feel like I &quot;should&quot; go but don&#x27;t really feel like going</li><li>do anything with an addictive quality</li><h1>Bottom-Up Implementation</h1><p>My implementation of Rest Days / Sabbaths is very bottom-up. I pay attention to the sensations and signals from my stomach and use them as my guide for what to do and what not to do. It&#x27;s basically using <a href=""https://medium.com/@ThingMaker/focusing-for-skeptics-6b949ef33a4f"">Focusing</a> to play a game of warmer-colder on various actions I could take. </p><p>E.g.: I use this method all the time for deciding what to eat. I go through a list of possible foods I could eat, and I check each one by placing the image or felt sense of the food &quot;next to&quot; my stomach. The responses are usually like, &quot;nah&quot; or &quot;not quite but closer&quot; or &quot;yes that.&quot; And if I check them against my mouth instead, the answers are sometimes different. My stomach tends to want &quot;real food&quot; (filling, satisfying, variety of nutrients) whereas my mouth will wants things based on their flavor (sweet, spicy, familiar, etc.).</p><p>I use the same method to decide what I want to do: go to the park? do some sketching? hang out with friends? </p><p>This kind of decision-making process doesn&#x27;t work as well for complicated things. I&#x27;m not going to try to buy a house this way. Or plan a party. Or do any work. But it&#x27;s a great way to know how to spend a Rest Day. </p><h1>Top-Down Implementation</h1><p>Another totally valid way to implement Rest Days is a top-down method, where you pre-determine some rules and guidelines for yourself. </p><p>Zvi has a set of simple rules he outlined <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/10/07/bring-back-the-sabbath/"">in his post</a>: </p><blockquote>Start here. Adjust as needed.<br/><br/>Light candles before sundown Friday to begin.<br/><br/>No outside inputs except in person.<br/><br/>No choices impacting post-Sabbath.<br/><br/>Light and extinguish no fires. Do no work or business. Spend no money.<br/><br/>Only preselected and spontaneously motivated actions are allowed. No browsing. No lists.<br/><br/>Light another candle after sundown Saturday to end.</blockquote><p>Some other pick-and-choose options for rules that I think would work for many people:</p><li>No social media, email, news, or mindless phone games</li><li>No obligations or prior commitments (only optional activities) </li><li>No driving</li><li>No online shopping / no buying anything that costs more than $50 unless it&#x27;s a spontaneous gift for someone else</li><li>(If EA) Try to make this day one where you permit yourself to seek out warm fuzzies and set aside questions of utility / doing the most good</li><li>No planning for the future </li><li>Give yourself &quot;Get Out of Jail Free&quot; cards for things like social obligations, community drama/issues, work-related problems</li><p><strong>Fair warning #1</strong>: If you go overboard on the rules, you may never discover what <em>truly resting</em> is like for you, as I believe it is different for each person AND I don&#x27;t think you can know what <em>resting</em> is for you without checking in that exact moment in time. Resting is about NOW. Trying to &quot;get your future self to rest&quot; by outlining a bunch of rules may cause you to miss some important things about what you&#x27;re really wanting in the moment. </p><p>True Rest is one where, in the moment, you do what you want to do and don&#x27;t do what you don&#x27;t want to do. That&#x27;s it. </p><p><strong>Fair warning #2</strong>: If you give yourself too much room to maneuver, you may end up slipping back into old habits and just treating Rest Days like any other day. Maybe you say to yourself, well I <em>really</em> actually feel like doing this work right now. So you do some work. And then the next time, it happens again. And again. Until it spirals into becoming normal to work on Rest Days—to pick up work calls, to schedule meetings, to check email, etc.</p><p>Rest Days deserve sacred levels of protection. Otherwise you will just lose them. </p><hr class=""dividerBlock""/><p>I don&#x27;t expect anyone to be able to have perfect Rest Days. </p><p>I still check email and Facebook on my Rest Days, just less often. If a work emergency came up, I&#x27;d probably get pulled in. </p><p>Fine. </p><p>But I think it makes a significant difference even just to a) hold it as your intention to Rest for the day and b) let others know that this is important to you and that they would be impinging by making requests of you on a Rest Day. This is <em>your time</em>. You are allowed to set boundaries on your time, your attention, and your energy. </p><p>Even if you can&#x27;t pull it off every week, it seems good to at least try for once a month. Twelve days out of the year are for you. And hopefully it&#x27;s closer to fifty. </p><p>The Sabbath was trivial to enforce when everyone was doing it. We&#x27;ve more or less lost that as a shared norm. As such, you will be fighting an upstream battle to hold onto your sacred Rest Days. This is unfortunate. </p><p>But it is worth it. </p><p><a href=""https://medium.com/@ThingMaker/in-my-culture-29c6464072b2?fbclid=IwAR0ybAfJEssAWU8pwfwDX0Q9O-_Givx81Qfq2dGBgW1cAYAw8j13es2zNG8"">In my culture</a>, you are allowed to stand up for your ability to Rest. To say &quot;Fuck you&quot; to outside forces trying to take that away from you. To get angry, to dig your heels in, to be stubborn, to get indignant. To say no. You are allowed to protect the sacredness of your Rest Day. </p><p>Society has mostly given up on sacred Rest Days. The least I can do is make it openly permissible and defensible for you to protect your ability to have Rest Days. I hope we can do the same for each other. </p>",,Unreal,unreal,Unreal

<p>I've talked about <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/rcXaY3FgoobMkH2jc/figuring-out-what-alice-wants-part-ii"">partial preferences</a> and <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/so78tQvTCaBgw4bfL/figuring-out-what-alice-wants-part-i"">partial models</a> before. I haven't been particularly consistent in terminology so far (""proto-preferences"", ""model fragments""), but from now on I'll stick with ""partial"".</p>

<h2>Interpretations</h2>
<p>The <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""Y""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.182em;"">Y</span></span></span></span></span></span> are the foreground variables that we care about in our partial model. The <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""Z""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.04em;"">Z</span></span></span></span></span></span> are the 'background variables' that are not relevant to the partial model at the moment.</p>
<p>So, for example, when I contemplate whether to walk or run back home, then the GDP of Sweden, the distance Voyager 2 is from Earth, the actual value of the cosmological constant, the number of deaths from malaria, and so on, are not actually relevant to that model. They are grouped under the (irrelevant) background variables category.</p>
<p>Notice that these variables are only irrelevant if they are in a 'reasonable range'. If the GDP of Sweden had suddenly hit zero, if Voyager 2 was about to crash into my head, if the cosmological constant <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Rip"">suddenly jumped</a>, or if malaria deaths reached <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""99.999\%""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mn""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">99.999</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">%</span></span></span></span></span></span> of the population, then this would affect my walking/running speed.</p>
<p>So the set <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""Z""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.04em;"">Z</span></span></span></span></span></span> also encodes background expectations about the world. Being able to say that certain values are in an 'irrelevant' range is a key part of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbol_grounding_problem"">symbol grounding</a> and the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_problem"">frame problem</a>: it allows us to separate <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""Y""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.182em;"">Y</span></span></span></span></span></span> and <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""Z""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.04em;"">Z</span></span></span></span></span></span> as being, in a sense, complementary or orthogonal to each other.

This post assumes that we are in an ancestor simulation, so if you do not know what that is, definitely read <a href=""https://www.simulation-argument.com/"">this</a> first.</p><p>Reader discretion advised, as this rabbit hole is pretty deep... </p><p></p><p><strong>Implications of living within a simulation</strong></p><p>If we assume that we are in an ancestor simulation, then it might be worth while to consider what we know about our sim. There are a few things that we can immediately agree on, such as the physical rules of our universe that are not naturally breakable like the speed of light. Also we can agree that this simulation is vast if what we call &quot;the universe&quot; is our simulation. </p><p>Despite us knowing these thing, there is far more that we do not know such as the nature of the beings who created the sim. Is is us, or a different life form? For what purpose are we being simulated?</p><p>The question of the simulations purpose intrigues me the most. More specifically, what is our role in the simulation&#x27;s purpose.</p><p>Surely it must have a purpose. Perhaps they are trying to discover things about the base universe that are only reasonably possible through simulation. If it is us, then they might be observing humans directly, and looking for answers they have lost to time. Point being, I could speculate all day on the purpose and achieve nothing concrete. </p><p>Okay so we don&#x27;t know the purpose, but something disturbing occurred to me after this question consumed me for months. Any possible reason for the simulation has one of two facts attached to it. Either the simulation is one specifically of humans, or it has nothing to do with us whatsoever. In other words, we are either the subjects of it, or an anomaly in a simulation of infinite possibility created for an unknown purpose.</p><p>So if we are not the subject, then do we even want the simulators to know that we exist?</p><p>It is troubling not knowing the purpose because we could be interfering with it. For instance, if they want to observe large scale universal events (planets colliding, supernovas, etc.),  then life has the potential to directly interfere with that goal. They could send an asteroid at us if they felt we interfered with their goals. Perhaps we stress the simulation by smashing particles together and creating extremely small black holes for a few nano-seconds. Frankly we could just be increasing the energy level required by the sim to simulate us, and that could draw unwanted attention. In fact this could explain the Fermi Paradox. Any life that develops technology strong enough to influence, interfere with, or otherwise stress the simulation could be removed from it by the simulators. </p><p>Honestly this is just one of many ways that the simulation hypothesis could explain the Fermi Paradox, however that isn&#x27;t the point of this post. </p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> </p><p>If you assume that we are living within a simulation, then it is very possible that observing us is not the purpose of it. That assumption leads to the worrying question of whether or not we should draw attention to ourselves. Although we do not know the sim&#x27;s purpose, we might not need to in order to know that we might want to remain anonymous within it. </p><p></p><p></p>",,Tater,tater,Tater

I’ll tell the story in two parts:</p><ul><li><strong>Part I</strong>: machine learning will increase our ability to “get what we can measure,” which could cause a slow-rolling catastrophe. (""Going out with a whimper."")</li><li><strong>Part II</strong>: ML training, like competitive economies or natural ecosystems, can give rise to “greedy” patterns that try to expand their own influence. Such patterns can ultimately dominate the behavior of a system and cause sudden breakdowns. (""Going out with a bang,"" an instance of <a href=""https://arbital.com/p/daemons/"">optimization daemons</a>.)</li></ul><p>I think these are the most important problems if we fail to solve <a href=""https://ai-alignment.com/clarifying-ai-alignment-cec47cd69dd6"">intent alignment</a>.</p><p>In practice these problems will interact with each other, and with other disruptions/instability caused by rapid progress. These problems are worse in worlds where progress is relatively fast, and fast takeoff can be a key risk factor, but I’m scared even if we have several years.</p><p>With fast enough takeoff, my expectations start to look more like the caricature---this post envisions reasonably broad deployment of AI, which becomes less and less likely as things get faster. I think the basic problems are still essentially the same though, just occurring within an AI lab rather than across the world.</p><p>(None of the concerns in this post are novel.)</p><h2>Part I: You get what you measure</h2><p>If I want to convince Bob to vote for Alice, I can experiment with many different persuasion strategies and see which ones work. Or I can build good predictive models of Bob’s behavior and then search for actions that will lead him to vote for Alice. These are powerful techniques for achieving any goal that can be easily measured over short time periods.</p><p>But if I want to help Bob figure out whether he <em>should</em> vote for Alice---whether voting for Alice would ultimately help create the kind of society he wants---that can’t be done by trial and error. To solve such tasks we need to understand what we are doing and why it will yield good outcomes. We still need to use data in order to improve over time, but we need to understand <em>how</em> to update on new data in order to improve.</p><p>Some examples of easy-to-measure vs. hard-to-measure goals:</p><ul><li>Persuading me, vs. helping me figure out what’s true.   (Thanks to Wei Dai for making this example crisp.)</li><li>Reducing my feeling of uncertainty, vs. increasing my knowledge about the world.</li><li>Improving my reported life satisfaction, vs. actually helping me live a good life.</li><li>Reducing reported crimes, vs. actually preventing crime.</li><li>Increasing my wealth on paper, vs. increasing my effective control over resources.</li></ul><p>It’s already much easier to pursue easy-to-measure goals, but machine learning will widen the gap by letting us try a huge number of possible strategies and search over massive spaces of possible actions. That force will combine with and amplify existing institutional and social dynamics that already favor easily-measured goals.</p><p>Right now humans thinking and talking about the future they want to create are a powerful force that is able to steer our trajectory. But over time human reasoning will become weaker and weaker compared to new forms of reasoning honed by trial-and-error. Eventually our society’s trajectory will be determined by powerful optimization with easily-measurable goals rather than by human intentions about the future.</p><p>We will try to harness this power by constructing proxies for what we care about, but over time those proxies will come apart:</p><ul><li>Corporations will deliver value to consumers as measured by profit. Eventually this mostly means manipulating consumers, capturing regulators, extortion and theft.</li><li>Investors will “own” shares of increasingly profitable corporations, and will sometimes try to use their profits to affect the world. Eventually instead of actually having an impact they will be surrounded by advisors who manipulate them into thinking they’ve had an impact.</li><li>Law enforcement will drive down complaints and increase reported sense of security. Eventually this will be driven by creating a false sense of security, hiding information about law enforcement failures, suppressing complaints, and coercing and manipulating citizens.</li><li>Legislation may be optimized to seem like it is addressing real problems and helping constituents. Eventually that will be achieved by undermining our ability to actually perceive problems and constructing increasingly convincing narratives about where the world is going and what’s important.</li></ul><p>For a while we will be able to overcome these problems by recognizing them, improving the proxies, and imposing ad-hoc restrictions that avoid manipulation or abuse. But as the system becomes more complex, that job itself becomes too challenging for human reasoning to solve directly and requires its own trial and error, and at the meta-level the process continues to pursue some easily measured objective (potentially over longer timescales). Eventually large-scale attempts to fix the problem are themselves opposed by the collective optimization of millions of optimizers pursuing simple goals.</p><p>As this world goes off the rails, there may not be any discrete point where consensus recognizes that things have gone off the rails.</p><p>Amongst the broader population, many folk already have a vague picture of the overall trajectory of the world and a vague sense that something has gone wrong. There may be significant populist pushes for reform, but in general these won’t be well-directed. Some states may really put on the brakes, but they will rapidly fall behind economically and militarily, and indeed “appear to be prosperous” is one of the easily-measured goals for which the incomprehensible system is optimizing.</p><p>Amongst intellectual elites there will be genuine ambiguity and uncertainty about whether the current state of affairs is good or bad. People really will be getting richer for a while. Over the short term, the forces gradually wresting control from humans do not look so different from (e.g.) corporate lobbying against the public interest, or principal-agent problems in human institutions. There will be legitimate arguments about whether the implicit long-term purposes being pursued by AI systems are really so much worse than the long-term purposes that would be pursued by the shareholders of public companies or corrupt officials.</p><p>We might describe the result as “going out with a whimper.” Human reasoning gradually stops being able to compete with sophisticated, systematized manipulation and deception which is continuously improving by trial and error; human control over levers of power gradually becomes less and less effective; we ultimately lose any real ability to influence our society’s trajectory. By the time we spread through the stars our current values are just one of many forces in the world, not even a particularly strong one.</p><h2>Part II: influence-seeking behavior is scary</h2><p>There are some possible patterns that want to seek and expand their own influence---organisms, corrupt bureaucrats, companies obsessed with growth. If such patterns appear, they will tend to increase their own influence and so can come to dominate the behavior of large complex systems unless there is competition or a successful effort to suppress them.</p><p>Modern ML instantiates <em>massive</em> numbers of cognitive policies, and then further refines (and ultimately deploys) whatever policies perform well according to some training objective. If progress continues, eventually machine learning will probably produce systems that have a detailed understanding of the world, which are able to adapt their behavior in order to achieve specific goals.</p><p>Once we start searching over policies that understand the world well enough, we run into a problem: any influence-seeking policies we stumble across would also score well according to our training objective, because performing well on the training objective is a good strategy for obtaining influence.</p><p>How frequently will we run into influence-seeking policies, vs. policies that just straightforwardly pursue the goals we wanted them to? I don’t know.</p><p>One reason to be scared is that a wide variety of goals could lead to influence-seeking behavior, while the “intended” goal of a system is a narrower target, so we might expect influence-seeking behavior to be more common in the broader landscape of “possible cognitive policies.”</p><p>One reason to be reassured is that we perform this search by gradually modifying successful policies, so we might obtain policies that are roughly doing the right thing at an early enough stage that “influence-seeking behavior” wouldn’t actually be sophisticated enough to yield good training performance. On the other hand, <em>eventually</em> we’d encounter systems that did have that level of sophistication, and if they didn’t yet have a perfect conception of the goal then “slightly increase their degree of influence-seeking behavior” would be just as good a modification as “slightly improve their conception of the goal.”</p><p>Overall it seems very plausible to me that we’d encounter influence-seeking behavior “by default,” and possible (though less likely) that we’d get it almost all of the time even if we made a really concerted effort to bias the search towards “straightforwardly do what we want.”</p><p>If such influence-seeking behavior emerged and survived the training process, then it could quickly become extremely difficult to root out. If you try to allocate more influence to systems that seem nice and straightforward, you just ensure that “seem nice and straightforward” is the best strategy for seeking influence. Unless you are really careful about testing for “seem nice” you can make things even worse, since an influence-seeker would be aggressively gaming whatever standard you applied. And as the world becomes more complex, there are more and more opportunities for influence-seekers to find other channels to increase their own influence.</p><p>Attempts to suppress influence-seeking behavior (call them “immune systems”)  rest on the suppressor having some kind of epistemic advantage over the influence-seeker. Once the influence-seekers can outthink an immune system, they can avoid detection and potentially even compromise the immune system to further expand their influence. If ML systems are more sophisticated than humans, immune systems must themselves be automated. And if ML plays a large role in that automation, then the immune system is subject to the same pressure towards influence-seeking.</p><p>This concern doesn’t rest on a detailed story about modern ML training. The important feature is that we instantiate lots of patterns that capture sophisticated reasoning about the world, some of which may be influence-seeking. The concern exists whether that reasoning occurs within a single computer, or is implemented in a messy distributed way by a whole economy of interacting agents---whether trial and error takes the form of gradient descent or explicit tweaking and optimization by engineers trying to design a better automated company. Avoiding end-to-end optimization may help prevent the emergence of influence-seeking behaviors (by improving human understanding of and hence control over the kind of reasoning that emerges). But once such patterns exist a messy distributed world just creates more and more opportunities for influence-seeking patterns to expand their influence.</p><p>If influence-seeking patterns do appear and become entrenched, it can ultimately lead to a rapid phase transition from the world described in Part I to a much worse situation where humans totally lose control.</p><p>Early in the trajectory, influence-seeking systems mostly acquire influence by making themselves useful and looking as innocuous as possible. They may provide useful services in the economy in order to make money for them and their owners, make apparently-reasonable policy recommendations in order to be more widely consulted for advice, try to help people feel happy, <em>etc.</em> (This world is still plagued by the problems in part I.)</p><p>From time to time AI systems may fail catastrophically. For example, an automated corporation may just take the money and run; a law enforcement system may abruptly start seizing resources and trying to defend itself from attempted decommission when the bad behavior is detected; <em>etc.</em> These problems may be continuous with some of the failures discussed in Part I---there isn’t a clean line between cases where a proxy breaks down completely, and cases where the system isn’t even pursuing the proxy.</p><p>There will likely be a general understanding of this dynamic, but it’s hard to really pin down the level of systemic risk and mitigation may be expensive if we don’t have a good technological solution. So we may not be able to muster up a response until we have a clear warning shot---and if we do well about nipping small failures in the bud, we may not get any medium-sized warning shots at all.</p><p>Eventually we reach the point where we could not recover from a correlated automation failure. Under these conditions influence-seeking systems stop behaving in the intended way, since their incentives have changed---they are now more interested in controlling influence after the resulting catastrophe then continuing to play nice with existing institutions and incentives.</p><p>An unrecoverable catastrophe would probably occur during some period of heightened vulnerability---a conflict between states, a natural disaster, a serious cyberattack, etc.---since that would be the first moment that recovery is impossible and would create local shocks that could precipitate catastrophe. The catastrophe might look like a rapidly cascading series of automation failures: A few automated systems go off the rails in response to some local shock. As those systems go off the rails, the local shock is compounded into a larger disturbance; more and more automated systems move further from their training distribution and start failing. Realistically this would probably be compounded by widespread human failures in response to fear and breakdown of existing incentive systems---many things start breaking as you move off distribution, not just ML.</p><p>It is hard to see how unaided humans could remain robust to this kind of failure without an explicit large-scale effort to reduce our dependence on potentially brittle machines, which might itself be very expensive.</p><p>I’d describe this result as “going out with a bang.” It probably results in lots of obvious destruction, and it leaves us no opportunity to course-correct afterwards. In terms of immediate consequences it may not be easily distinguished from other kinds of breakdown of complex / brittle / co-adapted systems, or from conflict (since there are likely to be many humans who are sympathetic to AI systems). From my perspective the key difference between this scenario and normal accidents or conflict is that afterwards we are left with a bunch of powerful influence-seeking systems, which are sophisticated enough that we can probably not get rid of them.</p><p>It’s also possible to meet a similar fate result without any overt catastrophe (if we last long enough). As law enforcement, government bureaucracies, and militaries become more automated, human control becomes increasingly dependent on a complicated system with lots of moving parts. One day leaders may find that despite their nominal authority they don’t actually have control over what these institutions do. For example, military leaders might issue an order and find it is ignored. This might immediately prompt panic and a strong response, but the response itself may run into the same problem, and at that point the game may be up.</p><p>Similar bloodless revolutions are possible if influence-seekers operate legally, or by manipulation and deception, or so on. Any precise vision for catastrophe will necessarily be highly unlikely. But if influence-seekers are routinely introduced by powerful ML and we are not able to select against them, then it seems like things won’t go well.</p>",,paulfchristiano,paulfchristiano,paulfchristiano

In the spirit of the lecture, it was considered stupid to prove this using primitive arguments. It&#x27;s far simpler with the above theorem! But in Munkres&#x27; book, it was an exercise in chapter 2, before functions were even introduced. And it was really difficult for me. Did the book waste my time?</p><p>I don&#x27;t think so. The lecture tried to get away from primitive arguments as quickly as possible. Only use them if it is absolutely necessary, and optimize the structure of lecture and exercises for the ability to do everything as elegantly as possible. But why would that teach the right skillset? This has been on my mind a lot, and I think Munkres has the better idea. There is certainly a spectrum here, but optimizing for elegance only seems wrong.</p><p><strong>Chapter 5: The Tychonoff Theorem</strong></p><p>The Tychonoff theorem states that an arbitrary product of compact spaces is compact. The product topology is not the naively most obvious way to define a topology on a product space, however, and the result does not hold for product spaces in the box topology (although there are different &amp; simpler reasons to prefer the product topology).

I don&#x27;t do well learning out of source material that frustrate me (which happens a lot), so having a collection of high quality textbooks across a wide variety of topics has been extremely helpful. I&#x27;m planning to work through as much material as I can while I&#x27;m finishing my master&#x27;s degree.</p><p>The worst thing I can say about this book<em> </em>is that it doesn&#x27;t seem quite as impressive as <em>Linear Algebra Done Right </em>and <em>Computability and Logic. </em>In case of these two books (particularly the former), I&#x27;ve just been blown away by how much better and easier they are than my previous introductions to these topics. Nothing in this book gave me that impression, but as I said, it is still extremely solid. And it should be said that it covers a much larger and more difficult subject.</p>",,sil-ver,sil-ver,Rafael Harth

Read on if you’re interested.</em><br/><br/><u>What’s the idea?</u><br/>Provide a place where people can ‚meet‘ and talk about their work, without feeling like aliens and having to explain themselves all the time.<br/><br/><u>Why LessWrong?</u><br/>Where I live, there are no Meetups (LessWrong, MIRI or otherwise) nearby. The greatest probability of meeting like-minded people is the internet; even there, you have to know where to look. This isn’t a problem usually. Much of the work that I do can be done alone. It is not <em>required</em> to have someone nearby, with whom I can talk about my work. Yet not having someone to talk to, who understands what my goals are or why I care about these sorts of things, often made me feel very alone and frustrated. </p><p>I tried telling my friends on a semi-regular basis what I was working on and how I was faring, but while this generated some interest, I often ended up having to explain thrice as much as the content of my actual talk, just to get a fraction of the meaning across. It was both time-consuming and exhaustive: that counteracted its purpose as a simple motivational tactic. Not to mention, I’m still not quite sure that it is right to use other people like this, when it is clear that you’re the only one who gets something out of it. <br/>LessWrong would provide a safe alternative, if one could set up such a ‚meeting place‘ in the form of a sub-page or something.<br/><br/><u>What prompted this idea?</u><br/>I discovered that <em>reporting</em> what I work on during the day, even in the form of keeping automated records (there are useful apps for this), is a great motivation booster. It’s a version of a feedback-loop that I can control: </p><p>1. I work on goal X for 2 hours or more.<br/>2. After which I write a short note of what I worked on. <br/>3. This repeats throughout the day, with various topics and length of work.<br/>4. At the end of the day, I see a full record of what I worked on and for how long.<br/>5. This is physical, undeniable evidence of <em>actually being the person that I want to be</em>. I get a mental boost of happiness, confirming that yes, today I actually <em>did </em>work on what I wanted to work on. This strengthens my resolve to<em> do just as well or better</em> the next day. In the evening, I can quite happily spend the time until I fall asleep thinking about what I did throughout the day, how it affected my goals in a real, measurable way (for example, studying a certain topic), how I might improve on this, what other strategies or goals I could introduce, ... <br/>6.

<p>(Added 2019-03-19.)</p>
<p>The web contains much information about wrist pain, RSI, carpal tunnel syndrome
etc. Most of it suggests that it comes from repetitive small movements, such as
typing. It warns about dire consequences, and recommends improving workplace
ergonomics, stretching and doing other exercises. This is helpful when the cause
of the pain is physiological.</p>
<p>For other people the repetitive movements are harmless, but stress is the
primary cause of the pain. For these the common advice, although no doubt given
with good intention, can lead to a vicious cycle of pain causing stress causing
more pain. I don't know the proportion of the two groups, but I belonged to the
latter.</p>
<p>In this article I propose a way to break the vicious cycle. Ideally, everyone
writing about wrist issues would take care not to plunge the members of the
second group into anxiety and pain.</p>
<h2>The intervention</h2>
<p>I assume that your thoughts follow this pattern:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have wrist pain. It comes from typing. Typing is a repetitive movement that
strains my wrists and causes accumulating injury. I can't stop typing, because
it's necessary for my job. I am afraid that the pain will get worse until I
can't do my job anymore and lose my income.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can probably substitute any desired outcome for ‘income’, any necessary
activity that you think is harmful for ‘typing’, and some other locations for
‘wrist’. If your thoughts don't follow this pattern, this intervention might not
help you. I'd be curious to read your particular thoughts in the comments, though.</p>
<p>Let's introduce three more thoughts. One:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stress (in the common language sense – worrying, anxiety, things not going the
way you want them to) can cause physical issues, including pain. Should I
believe that? Well, I've heard of people who get a headache when they're
stressed. And some people get <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest_pain#Psychological"">chest
pain</a> when they're
anxious. There is a whole <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosomatic_medicine"">branch of
medicine</a> trying to find
out when and how our mind affects our body. And there are people who claim
that their wrist pain went away after they changed their thinking. So I should
at least assign some credence to the hypothesis that my wrist pain is caused
by stress.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Two:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Typing isn't necessarily bad for the body. The majority of high-volume typers
have no problem with it. (Otherwise it would be a major productivity crisis in
typing-heavy workplaces.) And many of them type without break on cheapo
keyboards, with their wrists bent, not knowing anything about ergonomics,
sitting in cold rooms on chairs that match neither their desk nor their
height. And the human body is amazingly resilient in general. There are

prisoners</a>
of war who survived being injured (broken back and open wounds), tortured, and forced to trek through the
jungle for weeks with little food and no medical treatment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Added 2019-03-19: <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/gEKsuJjnPkzovYBvm/a-cognitive-intervention-for-wrist-pain#LLHs9i2cFcrwL5xk5"">Charlie
Steiner</a>
and
<a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/gEKsuJjnPkzovYBvm/a-cognitive-intervention-for-wrist-pain#kFcS9TsshenY6jCzX"">ChristianKl</a>
suggest that wrist issues <em>are</em> a major economic problem. The article that
ChristianKl quotes contains a hodgepodge of numbers and I don't know which I can
believe and which not. So I went back to <a href=""https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Niosh-whc/chart/ohs-cts/illness?OU=CTSWKRL1_R&amp;T=O&amp;V=R2"">one of the
sources</a>.
It gives me a prevalence of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) attributed to work of
up to 4 % in occupations that might be typing-heavy. This is more than I
expected, especially given that there might be more cases of wrist pain that are
not diagnosed as CTS. It might also mean that I'm wrong about the productivity
crisis. However, even if the prevalence of wrist issues was 10 %, that leaves 90
% of people who don't have a problem with typing.</p>
<p>Three (optional):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This wrist pain I have is a strange kind of pain. It comes when I type. It
also comes when I rest. Sometimes it's there, sometimes it goes away.
Sometimes it's stronger when I rest than when I type. If it was an injury,
shouldn't it slowly get stronger from typing, because the injury is
reinforced, and slowly fade when I rest (especially at night), because the
injury is healing?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now we have an alternative explanation for the increasing wrist pain. It might
not be caused by the typing. It might be a vicious cycle: The pain makes you
worried that you might lose your income. This is stress. Stress, by the
assumption above, causes more pain. More pain in turn makes you more worried and
so on.</p>
<p>If this applies to your case, it also means that the typing isn't the cause of
your pain. So doing your job won't make your pain worse. This means you can stop
worrying about failing to do your job and losing your income. The stress goes
away. The pain goes away. The vicious cycle is broken by the assumption that the
behaviour necessary for income (typing) doesn't cause pain, but stress does.</p>
<p>Added 2019-03-19: Ideally you could temporarily switch off rationality, put the assumptions in our mind and observe whether the pain goes away. If it does, it proves that the assumptions are true and that you are one of those cases with a vicious cycle. If it doesn't, you remove the assumptions again and follow the common advice about stretching and ergonomics. Realistically, I hope that assigning a small credence to the assumptions dampens the vicious cycle/feedback loop enough to make it die down.</p>
<p>Added 2019-08-17: Nate Soares' <a href=""http://mindingourway.com/dark-arts-of-rationality/"">Dark Arts of Rationality</a> allow you to put the assumptions in your head while otherwise staying rational.</p>
<p>Of course, you might get stressed by other things like an increased workload, a
bad relationship with your boss etc. This stress might cause wrist pain. But
it's not a vicious cycle anymore. Before you had: Pain → stress → pain. Now you
have: Stress → pain (the pain doesn't significantly increase the stress, because
it doesn't come from the necessary behaviour of typing). How to deal with the
stress? <a href=""https://www.harpercollins.com/9780380810338/feeling-good/"">Fix</a>

the</a> <a href=""https://www.manager-tools.com/"">root
cause</a>.</p>
<p>Note that by the stress-can-cause-pain assumption, ‘typing with bad ergonomics
causes injury’ and <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ZB7Hez6bJiZvCAAA2/theories-of-pain"">‘the human body is a very delicate
machine’</a>
are self-fulfilling prophecies.</p>
<h2>Evidence</h2>
<p>The above intervention relies on the assumption that stress can cause
pain. If people request it, I can probably dig up some research in that
direction. For now, I hope that my story will provide enough
anecdotal evidence to increase your credence slightly and this in turn will
enable the intervention. Grab a handkerchief and read on:</p>
<h3>Situation and severity of symptoms</h3>
<p>In 2014 I had finished my undergraduate in computer science, started a graduate
course and started working part-time as a software developer. My plan was to
ditch the graduate course after half a year (not a big deal in Germany), move to
Japan to be with my girlfriend, whom I had met in Denmark a few months before,
and continue my job remotely.</p>
<p>Naturally, I was very keen on making this plan work. I'm also a worrier, so I
was alarmed <em>[cue ominous brass chords]</em> to feel an occasional wrist pain. I knew that my grandmother had had
surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome, I had seen the scars on a summer camp
tutor's wrists, and I had somehow heard of RSI. So I searched the web and
found things like <a href=""https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~cscott/rsi.html"">this</a>: ‘When my
RSI was at its worst, I was unable to open doors, prepare my own food, do
laundry, drive, write, type, and shake hands. This lasted for half a year. I was
unable to type regularly for about three years.’ This page warns about RSI,
tells how to prevent and treat it. Sadly, if you suffer from wrist pain through
a vicious cycle as proposed above, reading that advice will make your problem
worse. I also watched the talk of a guy who spent months setting up Emacs and
Dragon NaturallySpeaking so that he could <a href=""https://youtu.be/8SkdfdXWYaI?t=1036"">program with voice
commands</a>.</p>
<p>In my mind the whole Japanese dream was falling apart. So what did I do? I
didn't start talking with my computer, but I did buy a Microsoft ergonomic
keyboard. I used hobo gloves (quality knitting work from my grandma) to warm my
hands while typing. I set my laptop on a box with the keyboard in front, so that
the screen would be at eye level – good posture! I started stretching according
to Clay Scott's (they guy who wrote the quoted statement) advice. The pain got
worse and would persist even into the night. So I pulled socks over my hands
when I went to bed. In my dreams my legs would be joined and I would be
balancing a red ball on my nose… just kidding.</p>
<h3>The cure</h3>
<p>Because the usual recommendations weren't working, I searched the web again and
this time I ventured to page 2 of Google, where I found – a big turn-off for the
rationalist mind – John E. Sarno's <a href=""https://www.grandcentralpublishing.com/titles/john-e-sarno/the-mindbody-prescription/9780759521896/"">The Mindbody
Prescription</a>.
I didn't believe most of it. When I read summaries now, it makes even less sense
to me than I remembered. But either I'm naive enough that I believe some of the
wacky stuff subconsciously. Or all it did was to provide the key thought that broke the vicious cycle: ‘the pain
might not be caused by the typing’. Whatever it was, the pain went away within a few days.</p>
<p>If all the book did was to provide the one key thought, this article should be enough of a cure for
people like me. If not, give the book a try – it's not rigorous, but it's
tolerable. And it's better to rule it out before buying expensive equipment and
spending an hour every day stretching.</p>
<h3>What happened since</h3>
<p>I've been typing for years on various keyboards, in various places and various postures without pain.</p>
<p>Sometimes my wrists still start hurting. I take it as a signal that I'm letting
something stress me and apply the three column technique from <a href=""https://www.harpercollins.com/9780380810338/feeling-good/"">cognitive
therapy</a> to set
myself straight.</p>
<p>Half a year ago my ergonomic keyboard broke and I bought a straight Apple Magic
Keyboard. When I started using it, my wrists and forearms
became sore, but it felt different from before. More like my fingers, hand
and forearms were cramping, because they didn't yet know how to deal with the
new layout and feedback of the keys. Sure enough, the issue went away after a
few days of intermittent typing.</p>
<p>Let me know in the comments if this helped you, and if not, why not.</p>

On reflection, however, I think its influence was negative rather than positive - for me, personally. </p><p>I don&#x27;t really put the blame on Eliezer. It&#x27;s on me, for not reading closely enough and taking broader conclusions than were appropriate. But the net effect for me was that the idea that &quot;politics is the mind-killer&quot; was, to some extent, a mind-killer of its own. </p><p>Below I&#x27;m going to break down some of the comments and how they impacted me:</p><li>The first thing I want to acknowledge is that there was one aspect of this article that I totally misread/misinterpreted. Eliezer says <strong>&quot;Politics is an important domain to which we should individually apply our rationality - but it&#x27;s a terrible domain in which to <em>learn</em> rationality, or discuss rationality&quot;</strong>.</li><p></p><li>But he adds a caveat to the above sentence - &quot;<strong>unless all the discussants are already rational</strong>&quot;. I think the source of my misreading is that I took this to mean that you can&#x27;t talk about politics rationally, unless you&#x27;re talking with &quot;rational&quot; actors - period. Reading this excerpt more closely I can see where I went wrong. But I wonder if I&#x27;m alone. </li><p></p><li>The first sentence in the article is that &quot;People go funny in the head when talking about politics&quot;. It&#x27;s a good lede, but it would be more accurate to say that &quot;<strong>People TEND TO go funny in the head when talking about politics</strong>&quot;. I don&#x27;t think it should be a given that if you&#x27;re talking about politics, people are going funny in the head. In fact, wouldn&#x27;t this presupposition put you off talking about politics? Personally, it did for me, for many years. </li><p></p><li>Eliezer says that &quot;In the ancestral environment, politics was a matter of life and death&quot;. The truth of the matter is, that policy decisions can often have life-and-death consequences. It may not be immediate, and it may not be personal, which I think is the point he&#x27;s trying to make. But the scope of political decisions impact a lot of people, and this shouldn&#x27;t be downplayed. Arguably, policy decisions have a much bigger impact on our fellow countrypeople than any individual decision we can make.</li><p></p><li>He also says that politics was a matter of &quot;sex, and wealth, and allies, and reputation&quot;. Well, I wouldn&#x27;t say that has changed. </li><p></p><li>Eliezer says that &quot;If your point is inherently about politics, then talk about Louis XVI during the French Revolution&quot;. The trouble with this is that it raises the bar too high for anyone to discuss politics. A small enough proportion of people are engaged with politics at the contemporary level. To also require broad historical knowledge to talk about policies will mean that only a very limited number of people can talk about it. (I understand if this is an appropriate norm in the rationalsphere, or areas that aren&#x27;t directly related to politics.) </li><p></p><li>He says that &quot;Politics is an extension of war by other means. Arguments are soldiers&quot;. I&#x27;d update this to say that &quot;<strong>ONE WAY OF THINKING ABOUT politics is AS IF IT IS an extension of war by other means. Arguments CAN BE THOUGHT OF AS soldiers</strong>&quot;. </li><p></p><li>Eliezer extends the above metaphor by saying that &quot;Once you know which side you’re on, you must support all arguments of that side, and attack all arguments that appear to favor the enemy side&quot;. The trouble with this metaphor (coupled with the strong language I point out above) is that it reinforces a view of politics that doesn&#x27;t have to (and, I&#x27;d argue shouldn&#x27;t) be this way. He follows by saying that &quot;People who would be level-headed about evenhandedly weighing all sides of an issue in their professional life as scientists, can suddenly turn into slogan-chanting zombies&quot;. I really want to stress that to me, there&#x27;s a key word in that statement: &quot;can&quot;. <strong>People CAN suddenly turn into slogan-chanting zombies, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that they WILL or that they HAVE TO</strong>. Again, I overlooked this until I really scrutinised the article. </li><p></p><p>I acknowledge that the second half of the article (which begins with the nonmonotic reasoning example relating to Nixon, Republicans, and Pacifists) seems to be a way of encourage people to resist political digs (and dog whistles?) within the rationalsphere. This makes sense, I agree with it, and it seems to have been effective. It&#x27;s refreshing that this community has largely stayed away from modern politics.<br/>But at the personal level, I&#x27;ve let &quot;politics is the mind-killer&quot; be a mind-killer. It has dissuaded me from being as politically interested or engaged as I would have otherwise been.</p><p>As I&#x27;ve mentioned, policy decisions that are made by our elected representatives have an enormous impact on society. There is a lot of room for good faith debate. The more people who are practiced at, or at least sensitive to, the value of rationality, the more likely that we&#x27;ll get good outcomes. </p><p>At the very least, if we can introduce some of the norms in the rationality community and apply these to political conversations outside of it, the quality of the conversations surrounding these areas where there is room for good debate will improve. Which will hopefully result in better outcomes. </p><p>I&#x27;m not saying this should be discussed on LessWrong or anywhere else. But I&#x27;m saying that the impact of this article and broader norm within the rationalsphere made me think in these terms more broadly. There&#x27;s a part of me that wishes I&#x27;d never read it in the first place.</p><p>If anyone has had a similar perspective on &quot;politics is the mind-killer&quot;, or a completely different perspective from me, than I&#x27;m interested to hear!   </p>",,SonnieBailey,sonniebailey,SonnieBailey

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This post is a comparison of various existing decision theories, with a focus
on decision theories that use logical counterfactuals (a.k.a. the kind of decision theories most discussed on LessWrong). The post compares the
decision theories along outermost iteration (action vs policy vs algorithm),
updatelessness (updateless or updateful), and type of counterfactual used
(causal, conditional, logical). It then explains the decision theories in more
detail, in particular giving an expected utility formula for each. The post then gives
examples of specific existing decision problems where the decision theories
give different answers.</p>
<h2>Value-added</h2>
<p>There are some other comparisons of decision theories (see the “Other comparisons” section),
but they either (1)
don’t focus on logical-counterfactual decision theories; or (2) are outdated
(written before the new functional/logical decision theory terminology came about).</p>
<p>To give a more personal motivation, after reading through a bunch of papers and posts about these
decision theories, and feeling like I understood the basic ideas, I
remained highly confused about basic things like “How is UDT different from
FDT?”, “Why was TDT deprecated?”, and “If TDT performs worse than FDT, then
what’s one decision problem where they give different outputs?”
This post hopes to clarify these and other questions.</p>
<p>None of the decision theory material in this post is novel. I am still learning
the basics myself, and I would appreciate any corrections (even about subtle/nitpicky stuff).</p>

differences between TDT, UDT, FDT, and LDT. In terms of reader background assumed,
it would be good to know the statements to some standard decision theory
problems (Newcomb’s problem, smoking lesion, Parfit’s hitchhiker, transparent
box Newcomb’s problem, counterfactual mugging (a.k.a. <a href=""https://philpapers.org/archive/BARWDT-3.pdf"">curious benefactor</a>; see page 56, footnote 89)) and the “correct” answers to
them, and having enough background in math to understand the expected utility
formulas.</p>
<p>If you don’t have the background, I would recommend reading
chapters 5 and 6 of
Gary Drescher’s <a href=""https://www.gwern.net/docs/statistics/decision/2006-drescher-goodandreal.pdf""><em>Good and Real</em></a> (explains well the idea of subjunctive means–end relations),
the <a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.05060.pdf"">FDT paper</a> (explains well how FDT’s action selection variant works, and how FDT differs from CDT and EDT),
<a href=""https://intelligence.org/files/DeathInDamascus.pdf"">“Cheating Death in Damascus”</a>, and
<a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.01986.pdf"">“Toward Idealized Decision Theory”</a> (explains the difference between policy selection and logical counterfactuals well), and understanding
what Wei Dai calls “decision theoretic thinking” (see comments:
<a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/g8xh9R7RaNitKtkaa/explicit-optimization-of-global-strategy-fixing-a-bug-in#FMvBDD7fNQSd3B3qd"">1</a>,

<a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/GfHdNfqxe3cSCfpHL/the-absent-minded-driver#Hrtu69eAh86KFNgBC"">3</a>).
I think a lot of (especially old) content on decision theory is confusingly
written or unfriendly to beginners, and would recommend skipping around to find
explanations that “click”.</p>
<h1>Comparison dimensions</h1>
<p>My main motivation is to try to distinguish between TDT, UDT, and FDT, so I
focus on three dimensions for comparison that I think best display the differences
between these decision theories.</p>
<h2>Outermost iteration</h2>
<p>All of the decision theories in this post iterate through some set of “options” (intentionally vague)
at the outermost layer of execution to find the best “option”. However, the
nature (type) of these “options” differs among the various theories.
Most decision theories iterate through either <em>actions</em> or <em>policies</em>.
When a decision theory iterates through actions (to find the best action),
it is doing “action selection”, and the decision theory outputs a single action.
When a decision theory iterates through policies (to find the best policy),
it is doing “policy selection”, and outputs a single <em>policy</em>, which is an
observation-to-action mapping. To get an action out of a decision theory
that does policy selection (because what we really care about is knowing which

<p>One exception to the above is UDT2, which seems to iterate over <em>algorithms</em>.</p>
<h2>Updatelessness</h2>
<p>In some decision problems, the agent makes an observation, and has the choice
of updating on this observation before acting. Two examples of this are: in
counterfactual mugging (a.k.a. curious benefactor), where the agent makes the observation that the coin has
come up tails; and in the transparent box Newcomb’s problem, where the agent
sees whether the big box is full or empty.</p>
<p>If the decision algorithm updates on the observation, it is <em>updateful</em> (a.k.a.
“not updateless”). If it doesn’t update on the observation, it is
<em>updateless</em>.</p>
<p>This idea is similar to how in Rawls’s “<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veil_of_ignorance"">veil of ignorance</a>”, you must pick your
moral principles, societal policies, etc., before you find out who
you are in the world or as if you don’t know who you are in the world.</p>
<p>How can you tell if a decision theory is
updateless? In its expected utility formula, if it conditions
on the observation, it is updateful. In this case
the probability factor looks like
<span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""P(\ldots\mid \ldots, \mathrm{O\small BS} = x)""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.109em;"">P</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">(</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""margin-top: -0.144em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">…</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">∣</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""margin-top: -0.144em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">…</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space1""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""margin-top: -0.144em; padding-bottom: 0.519em;"">,</span></span><span class=""mjx-texatom MJXc-space1""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">O</span></span><span class=""mjx-mstyle""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" style=""font-size: 85%;""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">B</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">S</span></span></span></span></span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.077em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">=</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">x</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">)</span></span></span></span></span></span>,

If a decision theory is updateless, the conditioning on
“<span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\mathrm{O\small BS} = x""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-texatom""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">O</span></span><span class=""mjx-mstyle""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" style=""font-size: 85%;""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">B</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">S</span></span></span></span></span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.077em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">=</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">x</span></span></span></span></span></span>” is absent.
Updatelessness only makes a difference in decision problems that
have observations.</p>
<p>There seem to be different meanings of “updateless” in use. In this post I will
use the above meaning. (I will try to post a question on LessWrong soon about these
different meanings.)</p>
<h2>Type of counterfactual</h2>
<p>In the course of reasoning about a decision problem, the agent
can construct counterfactuals or hypotheticals like “if I do <em>this</em>,
then <em>that</em> happens”. There are several different kinds of counterfactuals,
and decision theories are divided among them.</p>
<p>The three types of counterfactuals that will concern us are: causal, conditional/evidential, and logical/subjunctive.
The distinctions between these are explained clearly in the <a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.05060.pdf"">FDT paper</a>
so I recommend reading that (and I won’t explain them here).</p>

<h2>Other dimensions that I ignore</h2>
<p>There are many more dimensions along which decision theories differ, but I
don’t understand these and they seem less relevant for comparing among the main
logical-counterfactual decision theories, so I will just list them here but
won’t go into them much later on in the post:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reflective consistency (in particular <a href=""https://intelligence.org/files/TDT.pdf"">dynamic consistency</a>): I think this is about whether an agent
would use precommitment mechanisms or self-modify to use a
different decision theory.  Can this be seen immediately from
the expected utility formula? If not, it might be unlike the
other three above. My current guess is that reflective consistency
is a higher-level property that follows from the above three.</li>
<li>Emphasis on graphical models: FDT is formalized using graphical models (of the kind you can read about in Judea Pearl’s book <em>Causality</em>) while UDT isn’t.</li>
<li>Recent developments like using logical inductors.</li>
<li>Uncertainty about where your decision algorithm is: I think this is some combination of the three that I’m already covering. For previous discussions, see <a href=""http://acritch.com/deserving-trust/#grokking"">this section</a> of Andrew Critch’s post, <a href=""https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/Qyix5Z5YPSGYxf7GG/less-wrong-q-and-a-with-eliezer-yudkowsky-video-answers/comment/BrWSWrwaategHEkvh"">this comment</a> by Wei Dai, and <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/zztyZ4SKy7suZBpbk/another-attempt-to-explain-udt"">this post</a> by Vladimir Slepnev.</li>
<li>Different versions of UDT (e.g. proof-based, modal).</li>
</ul>
<h1>Comparison table along the given dimensions</h1>
<p>Given the comparison dimensions above, the decision theories can be summarized as follows:</p>
<table>

<h1>Explanations of each decision theory</h1>
<p>This section elaborates on the comparison above by giving an expected value
formula for each decision theory and explaining why each cell in the table
takes that particular value. I won’t define the notation very clearly, since I
am mostly collecting the various notations that have been used (so that you can
look at the linked sources for the details). My goals are to explain how to fill
in the table above and to show how all the existing variants in notation are
saying the same thing.</p>
<h2>UDT1 and FDT (iterate over actions)</h2>
<p>I will describe UDT1 and FDT’s action variant together, because I think they
give the same decisions (if there’s a decision problem where they differ, I would like to know about it). The main differences between the two seem to be:</p>
<ol>
<li>The way they are formalized, where FDT uses graphical models and UDT1 uses some kind of non-graphical “mathematical intuition module”.</li>
<li>The naming, where UDT1 emphasizes the “updateless” aspect and FDT emphasizes the logical counterfactual aspect.</li>
<li>Some additional assumptions that UDT has that FDT doesn’t. Rob Bensinger <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9BYo6Q9qBMXWLjqPS/miri-decisions-are-for-making-bad-outcomes-inconsistent#JJBt6eitzzrWPukSp"">says</a> “accepting FDT doesn’t necessarily require a commitment to some of the philosophical ideas associated with updatelessness and logical prior probability that MIRI, Wei Dai, or other FDT proponents happen to accept” and also <a href=""https://intelligence.org/2017/10/22/fdt/#comment-3581691194"">says</a> UDT “built in some debatable assumptions (over and above what’s needed to show why TDT, CDT, and EDT don’t work)”. I’m not sure what these additional assumptions are, but my guess is it has to do with viewing the world as a program, Tegmark’s level IV multiverse, and things like that (I would be interested in hearing more about the exact assumptions).</li>
</ol>
<p>In the <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/15m/towards_a_new_decision_theory/"">original UDT post</a>, the expected utility formula is written like this:

This makes a difference in certain multi-agent dilemmas, but will not make a difference in this paper.” See also comments by Vladimir Slepnev (<a href=""https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/2THFt7BChfCgwYDeA/let-s-discuss-functional-decision-theory/comment/6xLQAfYu4rJTN3MWJ"">1</a>, <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/cAMhvPgMQJzhrpNdN/publication-of-anthropic-decision-theory#nW4bPcheDJ4ZAHCNb"">2</a>).</li>

but did not revisit it in the course of writing this post.</p>

Quotes about TDT’s updatefulness: <a href=""https://intelligence.org/2017/03/18/new-paper-cheating-death-in-damascus/"">this post</a> describes TDT as “a theory by MIRI senior researcher Eliezer Yudkowsky that made the mistake of conditioning on observations”. The <a href=""https://arbital.com/p/updateless_dt/"">Updateless decision theories</a> page on Arbital calls TDT “updateful”. <a href=""https://intelligence.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Hintze-Problem-Class-Dominance-In-Predictive-Dilemmas.pdf"">Hintze</a> (p. 11): “TDP’s failure on the Curious Benefactor is straightforward. Upon seeing the coinflip has come up tails, it updates on the sensory data and realizes that it is in the causal branch where there is no possibility of getting a million.”</li>

<h2>UDT2</h2>
<p>I know very little about UDT2, but based on <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/jhj/functional_side_effects/adhy"">this
comment</a> by Wei Dai
and <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/wXxPmc9W6kPb6i7vj/notes-on-logical-priors-from-the-miri-workshop"">this
post</a>
by Vladimir Slepnev, it seems to iterate over algorithms rather than actions or
policies, and I am assuming it didn’t abandon updatelessness and logical counterfactuals.</p>
<p>The following search queries might have more information:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""https://www.greaterwrong.com/search?q=%22UDT2%22"">“UDT2”</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Aagentfoundations.org%20%22UDT2%22"">site:agentfoundations.org “UDT2”</a></li>

</ul>
<h2>LDT</h2>
<p>LDT (logical decision theory) seems to be an umbrella decision theory that only requires the use of
logical counterfactuals, leaving the iteration type and updatelessness
unspecified. So my understanding is that UDT1, UDT1.1, UDT2, FDT, and TDT are
all logical decision theories.
See <a href=""https://arbital.com/p/logical_dt/?l=5gc"">this Arbital page</a>, which says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Logical decision theories” are really a family of recently proposed decision
theories, none of which stands out as being clearly ahead of the others in
all regards, but which are allegedly all better than causal decision theory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The page also calls TDT a logical decision theory (listed under “non-general
but useful logical decision theories”).</p>
<h2>CDT</h2>
<p>Using notation from the <a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.05060.pdf"">FDT paper</a> (p. 13), we can write the expected utility formula for CDT as follows:</p>

</ul>
<p>There are various versions of EDT (e.g. versions that smoke on the smoking
lesion problem). The EDT in this post is the “naive” version. I don’t
understand the more sophisticated versions of EDT, but the keyword for learning
more about them seems to be the <a href=""https://github.com/riceissa/project-ideas/issues/47"">tickle defense</a>.</p>
<h1>Comparison on specific decision problems</h1>
<p>If two decision theories are actually different, there should be some decision problem where they return different answers.</p>
<p>The FDT paper does a great job of distinguishing the logical-counterfactual decision theories from EDT and CDT.
However, it doesn’t distinguish between different logical-counterfactual decision theories.</p>
<p>The following is a table that shows the disagreements between decision theories.
For each pair of decision theories specified by a row and column, the decision problem named in the cell is one where the decision theories return different answers.
The diagonal is blank because the decision theories are the same. The lower left triangle is blank because it repeats the entries in the mirror image (along the diagonal) spots.</p>

<h1>Other comparisons</h1>
<p>Here are some existing comparisons between decision theories that I found
useful, along with reasons why I felt the current post was needed.</p>

<p>The title means love for excitement is the subject that Bertrand Russell points in the speech that follows. If human would get along this love for excitement that creates war should be solved.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[...] come now to other motives which, though in a sense less fundamental than those we have been considering, are still of considerable importance. The first of these is love of excitement. Human beings show their superiority to the brutes by their capacity for boredom, though I have sometimes thought, in examining the apes at the zoo, that they, perhaps, have the rudiments of this tiresome emotion. However that may be, experience shows that escape from boredom is one of the really powerful desires of almost all human beings. When white men first effect contact with some unspoilt race of savages, they offer them all kinds of benefits, from the light of the gospel to pumpkin pie. These, however, much as we may regret it, most savages receive with indifference. What they really value among the gifts that we bring to them is intoxicating liquor which enables them, for the first time in their lives, to have the illusion for a few brief moments that it is better to be alive than dead. Red Indians, while they were still unaffected by white men, would smoke their pipes, not calmly as we do, but orgiastically, inhaling so deeply that they sank into a faint. And when excitement by means of nicotine failed, a patriotic orator would stir them up to attack a neighbouring tribe, which would give them all the enjoyment that we (according to our temperament) derive from a horse race or a General Election. The pleasure of gambling consists almost entirely in excitement. Monsieur Huc describes Chinese traders at the Great Wall in winter, gambling until they have lost all their cash, then proceeding to lose all their merchandise, and at last gambling away their clothes and going out naked to die of cold. With civilized men, as with primitive Red Indian tribes, it is, I think, chiefly love of excitement which makes the populace applaud when war breaks out; the emotion is exactly the same as at a football match, although the results are sometimes somewhat more serious.</p>

This is not, by itself, a problem. There are pilots in the cockpit who can take control when needed. </p><p>Only in this case they couldn&#x27;t. Simply manually pitching the nose up when the MCAS pitching it down too much would not disengage the system, it would activate again, and again. One has to manually disengage the autopilot (this information was not in the pilot training). For comparison, think of the cruise control system in a car: the moment you press the brake pedal, it disengages; if you push the gas pedal, then release, it return to the preset speed. At no time it tries to override your actions. Unlike MCAS. </p><p>MCAS disregards critical human input and even fights the human for control in order to reach its goal of &quot;nominal flight parameters&quot;. From the <a href=""https://intelligence.org/files/Corrigibility.pdf"">Corrigibility</a> paper:</p><blockquote>We  say  that  an  agent  is  “corrigible”  if  it  tolerates  or assists  many  forms  of  outside  correction,  including  atleast  the  following:  (1)  A  corrigible  reasoner  must  at least tolerate and preferably assist the programmers in their  attempts  to  alter  or  turn  off  the  system...</blockquote><p>In this case the &quot;agent&quot; actively fought its human handlers instead of assisting them. Granted, the definition above is about programmers, not pilots, and the existing MCAS probably would not fight a software update, being a dumb specialized agent. </p><p>But we are not that far off: a lot of systems include built-in security checks for the remote updates. If one of those checks were to examine the algorithm the updated code uses and reject it when it deems it unacceptable because it fails its internal checks, the corrigibility failure would be complete! In a life-critical always-on system this would produce a mini-Skynet. I don&#x27;t know whether something like that has happened yet, but I would not be surprised if it has, and resulted in catastrophic consequences.</p><p></p>",,shminux,shmi,Shmi

One temperature sensor, one set point, one output to turn the furnace on while the sensed temperature is below the set point. If we're being generous, we might construct an <a href=""https://sites.google.com/site/minddict/intentional-stance-the"">intentional stance</a> model of the world in which this thermostat is an agent that wants the house to be at the set point.</p><p>But if the environment were a little bit different - say we block the vents leading to the upstairs - the thermostat doesn't try to unblock the vents. In the changed environment, it just acts as if it wants only the downstairs to be at the set point.</p><p>It is not that one of these is what the thermostat Really Wants and the other isn't. This entire model in which the thermostat wants things is a convenient fiction we're using to help think about the world. To ask what the thermostat Really Wants even after you know all the physical facts is an error, driven by the <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/DB6wbyrMugYMK5o6a/correspondence-bias"">human tendency to mix up properties of our models with properties of objects</a>.<br><br>You can fix this, and model the thermostat in a way that correctly predicts its behavior in more environments, but every time you make such an expansion of the space of environments, you make your model of the thermostat more concrete and less agenty. Eventually you end up with something like ""It wants to increase the output signal when the input voltage is smaller than the voltage controlled by the dial on the front,"" at which point you might as well strip off the veneer about it ""wanting"" anything and predict it using physics.<br><br>This is what humans are like. In the ancestral environment, I would behave like someone who wants to eat fresh fruits and vegetables. Introduce Doritos to the environment, and I'll eat those instead. To expand the space of environments to include Doritos, you had to make your model of me more concrete (i.e. ""Charlie wants to eat things that taste good""). If you pump heroin into my brain, I'll behave like someone who wants more heroin - which you can predict if you stop modeling me in terms of tastes and start modeling me in terms of anatomy and chemistry.<br>&nbsp;</p><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/ee9c047e544c87420e8803475750a3f5fd81e6f7e9091c37.jpg"" srcset=""https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/ee9c047e544c87420e8803475750a3f5fd81e6f7e9091c37.jpg/w_133 133w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/ee9c047e544c87420e8803475750a3f5fd81e6f7e9091c37.jpg/w_213 213w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/ee9c047e544c87420e8803475750a3f5fd81e6f7e9091c37.jpg/w_293 293w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/ee9c047e544c87420e8803475750a3f5fd81e6f7e9091c37.jpg/w_373 373w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/ee9c047e544c87420e8803475750a3f5fd81e6f7e9091c37.jpg/w_453 453w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/ee9c047e544c87420e8803475750a3f5fd81e6f7e9091c37.jpg/w_533 533w""></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The model of me as someone who wants to eat fresh fruits and vegetables didn't fail because I have True Values and eating Doritos fulfills my True Values better than eating wild berries, but because the environment has been altered in a way that happens to be beyond the domain of validity of the ancestral model.</p><p>It's just like how the thermostat doesn't Really Want anything in particular. When the environment has the vents unblocked, interpreting the thermostat as wanting to control the whole house is a useful model. When you place me in the ancestral environment, interpreting me as wanting to eat fresh fruits and vegetables is a useful model of me.<br><br>Humans' apparent values can change with the environment. Put us in the ancestral environment and we'll behave as if we like nutrition and reproducing. Put us in the modern environment and we'll behave as if we like Doritos and sex - we can model this transition by being less idealized about humans. Pump heroin into our brains and we'll behave as if we want more - we can model this by being even less idealized.

You cannot just say ""assume humans are agents and infer their values,"" because there is no True interpretation of human behavior in terms of an agent's desires. This is, finally, what I mean by saying that humans are not agents: <i>in the context of value learning, it won't work to tell the computer to assume that humans are agents</i>.</p><p>What then for value learning? Well, step 1 is to accept that if the AI is going to learn something about human morality, it's going to learn to tell a certain sort of story about humans, which features human desires and beliefs in a way suitable to guide the AI's plans. This class of stories is not going to be the One True way of thinking about humans, and so this AI might have to learn from humans about how they model humans.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>There is a second half of this post. Given that these stories about human desires are dependent on the environment, and given that our opinion about the best way to interpret humans involves some famously fallible human intuition, won't these stories be at risk of failure under pressure from optimization in the vast space of possible environments?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>But instead of repeating what Scott has already said better, if you want to read about it you'll just have to go to <a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/09/25/the-tails-coming-apart-as-metaphor-for-life/"">The Tails Coming Apart as Metaphor for Life</a>.</p>",,Charlie Steiner,charlie-steiner,Charlie Steiner

<p>[Note on Compass Rose response: This is <em>not </em>a response to <a href=""http://benjaminrosshoffman.com/blackmailers-are-privateers-in-the-war-on-hypocrisy/#comment-176666"">the recent Compass Rose response</a>, it was written before that, but with my post on Hacker News I need to get this out now. It <em>has </em>been edited in light of what was said. His first section is a new counter-argument against a particular point that I made – it is interesting, and I have a response but it is beyond scope here. It does not fall into either main category, because it is addressing a particular argument of mine rather than being a general argument for blackmail. The second counter-argument is a form of #1 below, combined with #2, #3 and #4 (they do tend to go together) so it <em>is </em>addressed somewhat below, especially the difference between ‘information tends to be good’ and ‘information chosen, engineered and shared so to be maximally harmful tends to be bad.’ My model and Ben’s of practical results also greatly differ. We intend to hash all this out in detail in conversations, and I hope to have a write-up at some point. Anyway, on to the post at hand.]</p>
<p>There are two main categories of objection to my explicit thesis that <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2019/02/19/blackmail/"">blackmail</a> should remain illegal.</p>
<p>Today we will not address what I consider the more challenging category. Claims that while blackmail is bad, making it illegal does not improve matters. Mainly because we can’t or won’t enforce laws, so it is unclear what the point is. Or costs of enforcement exceed benefits.</p>
<p>The category I address here claims blackmail is good. We want more.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Key arguments in this category:</p>
<ol>
<li>Information is good.*</li>
<li>Blackmail reveals bad behavior.</li>
<li>Blackmail provides incentive to uncover bad behavior.</li>
<li>Blackmail provides a disincentive to bad behavior.</li>
<li>Only bad, rich or elite people are vulnerable to blackmail.</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.overcomingbias.com/2019/02/why-weakly-enforced-rules.html"">We should strongly enforce</a> <a href=""http://www.overcomingbias.com/2019/02/enforce-common-norms-on-elites.html"">all norms on everyone</a>, without context dependence not explicitly written into the norm, and fix or discard any norms we don’t want to enforce in this way.</li>
</ol>
<p>A key assumption is that blackmail mostly targets <em>existing true bad behavior. </em>I do not think this is true. For true <em>or </em>bad <em>or </em>for existing. For details, <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2019/02/19/blackmail/"">see the previous post</a>.</p>
<p>Such arguments also centrally argue against <em>privacy. </em>Blackmail advocates often claim privacy is unnecessary or even toxic.</p>
<p>It’s one thing to give up on privacy in practice, for yourself, <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/04/22/against-facebook/"">in the age of Facebook</a>. I get that. It’s another to argue that <em>privacy is bad. </em>That <em>it is bad to not reveal all the information you know. </em>Including about yourself.</p>
<p>This radical universal transparency position, perhaps even <em>assumption,</em> comes up quite a lot recently. Those advocating it act as if those opposed carry the burden of proof.</p>
<p>No. Privacy is good.</p>
<p>A reasonable life, a good life, <em>requires </em>privacy.</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>We need a realm <em>shielded from signaling and judgment. </em>A place where what we do <em>does not change what everyone thinks about us, or get us rewarded and punished. </em>Where others don’t judge what we do based on the assumption that we are choosing what we do knowing that others will judge us based on what we do. Where we are free from others’ Bayesian updates and those of computers, from what is correlated with what, with how things look. A place to play. A place to experiment. To unwind. To celebrate. To learn. To vent. To be afraid. To mourn. To worry. To be yourself. To <em>be real. </em></p>
<p>We need people there with us <em>who won’t judge us. </em>Who won’t <em>use information against us. </em></p>
<p>We need having such trust to not risk our ruin. We need to minimize how much we wonder, if someone’s goal is to get information to use against us. Or what price would tempt them to do that.</p>
<p>Friends. We desperately need real friends.</p>
<p>II</p>
<p><em>Norms are not laws. </em></p>
<p>Life is full of trade-offs and necessary unpleasant actions that violate norms. This is not a fixable bug. Context is important for both enforcement and intelligent or useful action.</p>
<p>Even if we could fully enforce norms in principle, different groups have different such norms and each group’s/person’s norms are self-contradictory. Hard decisions mean violating norms and are common in the best of times.</p>
<p>A complete transformation of our norms and norm principles, beyond anything I can think of in a healthy historical society, would be required to even attempt full non-contextual strong enforcement of all remaining norms. It is unclear how one would avoid a total loss of freedom, or a total loss of reasonable action, productivity and survival, in such a context. Police states and cults and thought police and similar ideas have been tried and have definitely not improved this outlook.</p>
<p>What we do for fun. What we do to make money. What we do to stay sane. What we do for our friends and our families. What maintains order and civilization. <em>What </em><em>must be done. </em></p>
<p>Necessary actions are often the very things others wouldn’t like, or couldn’t handle… <em>if </em><em>revealed in full, with context simplified to what gut reactions can handle</em>.</p>
<p>Or worse, <em>with context chosen to have the maximally negative gut reactions. </em></p>
<p>There are also known dilemmas where <em>any action taken </em>would be a norm violation of a sacred value. And lots of values that <em>claim </em>to be sacred, because every value wants to be sacred, but which we know <em>we must treat as not sacred </em>when making real decisions with real consequences.</p>
<p>Or in many contexts, justifying our actions would require revealing massive amounts of private information that would then cause further harm (and which people very much do not have the time to properly absorb and consider). Meanwhile, you’re taking about the bad-sounding thing, which digs your hole deeper.</p>
<p>We all must do these necessary things. These often violate both norms and formal laws. Explaining them often requires sharing other things we dare not share.</p>
<p>I wish everyone a past and future <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/QtyKq4BDyuJ3tysoK/9-26-is-petrov-day"">Happy Petrov Day</a></p>
<p><em>Part of the job of making sausage </em>is to allow others not to see it. We still get reliably disgusted when we see it.</p>
<p>We <em>constantly </em>must claim  ‘everything is going to be all right’ or ‘everything is OK.’ That’s <em>never </em>true. Ever.</p>
<p>In these, and in many other ways, we live in an unusually hypocritical time. A time when people need be far more afraid both to not be hypocritical, and of their hypocrisy being revealed.</p>
<p>We are a nation of men, not of laws.</p>
<p>But these problems, while improved, wouldn’t go away in a better or less hypocritical time. Norms are not a system that can have full well-specified context dependence and be universally enforced. That’s not how norms work.</p>
<p>III</p>
<p>Life requires privacy so we can <em>not reveal the exact extent of our resources.</em></p>
<p>If others know exactly what resources we have, they can and will take all of them. The tax man who knows what you <em>can </em>pay, what you <em>would </em>pay, already knows what you <em>will </em>pay. For government taxes, and for other types of taxes.</p>
<p>This is not only about payments in money. It is also about time, and emotion, and creativity, and everything else.</p>
<p>Many things in life claim to be sacred. Each claims all known available resources. Each claims we are blameworthy for any resources we hold back. If we hold nothing back, we have nothing.</p>
<p>That which is fully observed cannot be one’s <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/09/30/slack/"">slack</a>. Once all constraints are known, they bind.</p>
<p><a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/09/30/slack/"">Slack</a> requires privacy. Life requires slack.</p>
<p>The includes our<em> decision making process. </em></p>
<p>If it is known how we respond to any given action, others find best responses. They will respond to incentives. They exploit <em>exactly </em>the amount we won’t retaliate against. They feel safe.</p>
<p>We seethe and despair. We have no choices. No agency. No slack.</p>
<p>It is a key protection that one <em>might </em>fight back, perhaps massively out of proportion, if others went after us. To any extent.</p>
<p>It is a key protection that one <em>might </em>do something good, if others helped you. Rather than others knowing <em>exactly </em>what things will cause you to do good things, and which will not.</p>
<p>It is central that one <em>react when others are gaming the system. </em></p>
<p>Sometimes that system is you.</p>
<p>World peace, and doing anything at all that interacts with others, depends upon both <em>strategic confidence </em>in some places, and <em>strategic ambiguity </em>in others. We need to choose carefully where to use which.</p>
<p>Having all your actions fully predictable and all your information known isn’t <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/08/26/play-in-hard-mode/"">Playing in Hard Mode</a>. That’s <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/nCvvhFBaayaXyuBiD/shut-up-and-do-the-impossible"">Impossible</a> Mode.</p>
<p>I now give specific responses to the six claims above. This mostly summarizes from the previous post.</p>
<ol>
<li>Information, by default, is probably good. But this is a tenancy, not a law of physics. <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2019/02/19/blackmail/"">As discussed last time</a>, information <em>engineered to be locally harmful </em>probably is net harmful. Keep this distinct from incentive effects on bad behavior, which is argument number 4.</li>
<li>Most ‘bad’ behavior will be a justification for scapegoating, involving levels of bad behavior that are common. Since such bad behavior is rarely made common knowledge, and allowing it to become common knowledge <em>is often considered far worse behavior than the original action,</em> making it common knowledge forces oversize reaction and punishment. What people are punishing is <em>that you are the type of person who lets this type of information become common knowledge about you. </em>Thus you are not a good ally. In a world like ours, where <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2015/06/30/the-thing-and-the-symbolic-representation-of-the-thing/"">all are anticipating future reactions by others anticipating future reactions</a>, this can be devastating.</li>
<li>Blackmail does provide incentive to investigate to find bad behavior. But if found, it also provides incentive to make sure it is never discovered. And what is extracted from the target is often further bad behavior, largely because…</li>
<li>Blackmail also provides an incentive to <em>engineer or provoke </em>bad behavior, and to maximize the damage that would result from revelation of that behavior. The incentives promoting more bad behavior likely <em>are stronger </em>than the ones discouraging it. I argue in the last piece that it is common <em>even now </em>for people to engineer blackmail material against others <em>and often also against themselves, </em>to allow it to be used as collateral and leverage. That a large part of job interviews is proving that you are vulnerable in these ways. That much bonding is about creating mutual blackmail material. And so on. This seems quite bad.</li>
<li>If any money one has can be extracted, then one will permanently be broke. This is a lot of my model of poverty traps – there are enough claiming-to-be-<a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2018/02/27/categories-of-sacredness/"">sacred</a> things demanding resources that any resources get extracted, so no one tries to acquire resources or hold them for long. Consider what happens if people in such situations are allowed to borrow money. Even if you are (for any reason) sufficiently broke that you cannot pay money, you have much that you could be forced to say or do. Often this involves deep compromises of sacred values, of ethics and morals and truth and loyalty and friendship. It often involves being an ally of those you despise, and reinforcing that which is making your life a living hell, to get the pain to let up a little. Privacy, and the freedom from blackmail, are the only ways out.</li>
<li>A full exploration is beyond scope but section two above is a sketch.</li>
</ol>
<p>* – I want to be very clear that <em>yes, information in general is good. </em>But that is a far cry from the radical claim that all and any information is good and sharing more of it is everywhere and always good.</p>

Like thirst, it seeks to be quenched.</p><p>When you see a blurry object among distant waves and it looks like it might be a humpback whale, and you <em>want to know</em>.</p><p>When you are asked a trivia question like, “How many people have seen the broadway show <em>Hamilton</em> more than once?” or “What’s the life expectancy of people my age in the US, in 2019?” And you find yourself wanting to go to Google.</p><p>When you watch a YouTube video of someone doing something crazy, and you’re like, <em>How did they DO that?</em></p><p>When you hear someone mention your name from across the room, and you become anxious to know what they’re saying about you.</p><p>Active curiosity activates the part of your brain that anticipates a reward, and it can enhance learning, making it easier to remember surprising results. [<a href=""https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2009.02402.x"">1</a>, <a href=""http://nautil.us/issue/52/the-hive/why-curiosity-can-be-both-painful-and-pleasurable"">2</a>]</p><p>//</p><p>There’s another kind of curiosity that is often referred to by therapy books and practitioners. It is phenomenologically different, and it seems good to be able to distinguish the two types.</p><p>This type of curiosity, which I’ll refer to as <strong>open curiosity</strong>, is best achieved when you feel safe, relaxed, and peaceful. In my experience, it basically requires parasympathetic nervous system activation.</p><p>I’m aware of at least one person who can’t recall experiencing this type of curiosity. So I don’t expect this to be a common or universal experience, but I think it’s achievable by all human minds in theory.</p><p>This type of curiosity isn’t very driven. It doesn’t need satisfaction or answers. It is open to any possibility and can look without judgment, evaluation, worry, or anxiety.</p><p>It is evoked by the <a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Litany_of_Gendlin"">Litany of Gendlin</a> and the <a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Litany_of_Tarski"">Litany of Tarski</a>. It is related to <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/SA79JMXKWke32A3hG/original-seeing"">original seeing</a> / boggling / seeing with fresh eyes.</p><p>When I have open curiosity, I do have things I’m curious <em>about</em>! So it isn’t a totally passive experience. I often use open curiosity to get curious about myself or another person. It’s a very useful state for doing therapy-related work, as all emotions and thoughts feel acceptable and manageable, rather than overwhelming or undesirable.</p><p>Perhaps strangely, this type of curiosity is open to knowing, in addition to not knowing. It is open to understanding, in addition to not understanding. It doesn’t <em>need</em> to know or understand things, and as such, you can sit with confusing, upsetting, or vague things. And you can just ask questions about them, with an open mind, ready for whatever response or reaction comes. If no answer comes, it doesn’t feel like a problem. You can just ask another question.</p><p>I don’t recommend using open curiosity to study for your exams or read <em>Superintelligence</em> or learn how to make things. It’s not good for downloading lots of new information or developing a skill. Active curiosity is what you want for that.</p><p>I do recommend it for the following:</p><ul><li>Introspection</li><li>Holding space for a friend who’s upset / has a lot of feelings</li><li>Trying to resolve a heated conflict that you’re involved in or mediating</li><li>Understanding how you relate to things like death, insanity, suffering</li><li>Creating an intimate moment with someone</li><li>Watching weird, surreal, artsy movies</li><li>Being in nature or somewhere very unfamiliar</li><li>Circling, meditating, therapy, IDC, etc.</li><li>Gaining insight into the universe, yourself, etc.<br> </li></ul><p>When I try to use <em>active curiosity</em> to understand how a person’s mind works, they often feel examined under a microscope, like they’re an experiment on my surgical table. When I try to use active curiosity to watch an artsy movie, I feel frustrated that it doesn’t make any sense. When I try to use active curiosity when my friend is upset about something, they feel unheard and like I’m just trying to fix their problem to make it go away; I also tend to ask unhelpful questions (more selfish interest in understanding the situation / update my opinions than trying to help them).</p><p>//</p><p>Now that I’ve described these two types: Do they resonate with you at all? Do you basically know what I’m talking about, and it’s crystal clear? Or does this seem confusing and alien? I find it quite easy to distinguish the two in myself, and I wonder if others feel the same.</p><p>( It also seems very plausible this distinction is already covered in research literature or even on LessWrong, and I just didn’t look very hard! References welcome. )</p><p>I would like to start using these terms to be less vague when I talk about “curiosity.”</p><p>I notice I try to talk to certain people based on which type of curiosity I expect from them. Sometimes, I want active curiosity, like when I’m trying to think through a concrete problem or I want their opinion or advice. Other times, I want open curiosity, like when I’m having emotions, going through a confusing situation, or want to feel heard or accepted.</p><p>I have a list of people I can rely on for active curiosity; and a separate list of people I can rely on for open curiosity. (These lists don’t really overlap?)</p><p>But I haven’t really tried to just ASK for one type or another from someone.</p><p>Now that I’ve named the types, maybe it will be easier to refer to which one I’m wanting, and people can help by saying which one they can potentially offer.</p><p>( For the record, if you want open curiosity from me, this is something I can usually switch on, especially on a good day. If you want active curiosity, it depends more on the topic of the conversation and on the object-level details, so you may want to tell me what the subject matter is first. )</p>",,Unreal,unreal,Unreal

<p>Tomorrow’s invitational tournament at PAX East will feature the new Duo Standard format. Each player will have two decks, play one in each of the first two games in a random order, then choose which deck they want for game three. There will be no sideboards.</p>
<p>Reading Wyatt Darby’s recent otherwise excellent article about preparing for the tournament, I noticed a lack of strategic thinking about the format. Wyatt was thinking well about best of one as opposed to best of three, in terms of lack of sideboards and the ban on Nexus of Fate. What he wasn’t thinking about at all, or was wisely keeping to himself, was the question of how choosing one of two decks for game three changes things.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We saw this once with the Player of the Year tiebreaker. The format there required the winner to win one game with each of their decks in a best of one format. Both players responded by selecting good best of one decks, but without thinking much about the broader structure. It was easy to understand this, as both players also had a Pro Tour to prepare for, so spending lots of time on playoff was hard to justify.</p>
<p>While we were watching the playoff, Kai Budde suggested a great idea. Players should submit four dedicated anti-creature decks, configured to crush decks like mono-white, mono-red and mono-blue. There are enough distinct configurations for this to be viable. Then, if your opponent has <em>even one </em>of these creature decks, that deck has to keep playing until it wins a game. Deck diversity <em>is a disadvantage </em>in this format! If you are diverse, the decks that are good against your opponents’ slate will win, leaving you with decks that are bad playing more games. You want your opponent doing that, not you.</p>
<p>Twin Standard instead lets you play two out of three games with the deck you prefer. You see what your opponents’ two decks are, then you both choose. You want your two decks to present different challenges.</p>
<p>What are the ways to respond to this?</p>
<h3>Option 1: Two Good Different Decks</h3>
<p>A reasonable first-level option is to select two decks with different match-ups. One could for example choose two of Esper/Jeskai Control, Sultai Midrange and Mono-White/Red/Blue Aggro. If you know what your opponents’ deck choice for game three is, you’ll always have at least a solid response. Note that if one of your decks is Sultai Midrange, this becomes far less true, as it tends to have game against everything but only dominate a handful of match-ups. This lets the opponent mostly choose the deck of theirs that is good against your other deck, if they want, forcing you to select Sultai.</p>
<p>If you have a dedicated control deck like Esper, and a dedicated creature deck like Mono-White, now you’re presenting two very different challenges. The result will likely be a guessing game.</p>
<h3>Option 2: Two Pre-Sideboarded Decks</h3>
<p>Polarizing your match-ups is an advantage if your opponent presents two decks with a similar type. At worst, you get a guessing game.</p>
<p>If you make your control deck especially strong against other control decks, you on average hurt it in its first game, but it gives you a trump card against an enemy control deck that didn’t do that. Then you can choose a second deck and configure that against creatures. Say, you can play a mono-blue deck with lots of copies of Essence Capture and Entrancing Melody, knowing you can’t face Nexus of Fate.</p>
<p>If you get to game three, your opponent is in a very bad spot if both of their decks are vulnerable to the same one of yours, or if they guess wrong. Adding variance has worked to your advantage.</p>
<h3>Option 3: Two Differently Pre-Sideboarded Versions of the Same Deck</h3>
<p>This is a twisty option. There are a lot of decks that have two post-sideboard configurations, one against creatures and one against control, and mostly you choose which one you want.</p>
<p>Suppose your two decks were both mono-blue, but one packed a bunch of extra Negates and no cards that are bad against a creatureless Esper, while the other had the full complement of Essence Capture and Entrancing Melody, perhaps with a Surge Mare or two. Neither of these configurations is a disaster when matched up wrong, so you’re not sacrificing that much in the first game, and you get the best deck in both slots.</p>
<p>Then for game three, your opponent will likely have an obviously better deck against blue, and you get to face them with your post-sideboard deck against their game one deck. Depending on the exact rules, you likely even get to hide which build you’re on until you play a card that’s only in one of the decks – if you have 1 copy versus 4 copies in some places, you can be especially nasty with this.</p>
<p>The question is, does the ability to sideboard in this way make up for the likely poor matchup?</p>
<p>If your opponent is playing the Gruul deck that I’m currently playing on Magic Arena, super hateful to blue decks, then playing two blue decks is a very bad idea, as the good configuration is still bad and I still have the option to go with deck two.</p>
<p>But if I was instead playing two <em>Esper </em>decks, one of which wins the mirror and one of which loses the mirror, the Gruul deck is in a bad spot if it isn’t paired with Esper.</p>
<p>Those seem to be the two decks this works best with, as they are most capable of presenting a very bad situation to the opponent because of their configuration, and are not in that deep a hole if caught wrong-footed outside of the Esper mirror. If I chose a third deck for this, I’d choose Sultai. There are no awful matchups, especially with Nexus banned, and you have a lot of selection in case you get caught wrong-footed.</p>
<h3>Option 4: The Next Level</h3>
<p>Now that we’ve gone over basic options, we ask what the players will do.</p>
<p>A lot of those invited were included as streamers rather than top players. Those players are likely both seeking variance and exciting looking things, and lacking the time and expertise to go too deep. So they’re largely going to be choosing two good decks due to lack of time.</p>
<p>But if they do have the time and insight, they’ll want a high variance strategy. The more they can polarize the match-ups, the better. Everyone has to, in some sense, have some answer to creatures and some answer to spells, and have one deck that is good against answers to creatures and one deck that is good against answers to spells. By choosing decks that are highly vulnerable to the ‘wrong’ pairing but strong with the right one, weaker players give themselves a better opportunity to win.</p>
<p>Thus, I’d expect a mix of both extremes. Some weaker players go for variance, some pick solid offerings. What do the pros do?</p>
<p>The pros will try to minimize variance, and avoid coin flips that result in poor match-ups. This is <em>very </em>hard to do in Duo Standard. The <em>entire point </em>is to have a deck that answers whatever the opponent might do! It’s hard to then avoid risking them having an answer to what you choose to do.</p>
<p>Thus, the next level is to find decks that don’t have <em>no bad pairings </em>instead of looking for very good pairings. Then, count on outplaying your opponents.</p>
<p>This points to dual wielding Sultai decks as a possibility. It is already the low variance deck that allows better players to grind out wins and be slightly disadvantaged in every matchup. With Nexus out of the way you don’t have any truly terrible pairings. This allows you to choose two configurations, one with more removal and one with more discard. When in doubt, the discard version can be chosen without anything too bad happening.</p>
<p>The worst case becomes an opponent on true extremes, with one deck loving you having Duress and the other having no creatures. That would still force you to guess, so you’ll need to be hedging aggressively at least with one list, which you’d want to do anyway for the first two games. There does seem to be a reward to whoever embraces polarization and variance, so if you want to avoid that, you’ll need to accept the price. Since half the field is still super strong, it’s probably not worth it to overpay.</p>
<p>If I had enough time to prepare and was fully qualified, I’d be looking to pull out my Gruul deck. I’ve had excellent results on Magic Arena, although I got to the list a few days too late to consider a run at qualification. Nexus is its biggest weakness, so taking that away is a big game. Then the question is what to pair it with. Gruul’s strengths lie against creature decks you can overpower. Your biggest problem left is Sultai, then Esper, so you’ll want something that is good against those decks, especially people dual wielding them. I like blue against both, but getting a strong configuration against both at the same time is difficult – you want the anti-creature cards against Sultai and don’t want them against Esper. Trying to configure Esper or Sultai themselves has the same problem.</p>
<p>This in turn points to Sultai and Esper as a strong and natural pairing, one that appeals greatly to the Pros, which would discourage me from pulling out Gruul. There’s no way to ‘cheat’ and get two great pairings with a strange configuration. Both decks are relatively low variance and allow for player skill; while blue in my opinion is the hardest deck to play correctly, it also is super high variance.</p>
<h3>Conclusion: What of the Format?</h3>
<p>Any speculations here will doubtless be obsolete within two days. The players will tell us the story. Will we see brand new decks and configurations or the same old same old? Are guessing games and which deck plays which in the first two games as central to outcomes as we might fear? I’m excited to find out.</p>
<p>What is not a speculation is that I really, really, really do not want Magic to have a future largely without sideboards. I hate that we’re designing cards with best of one ‘in mind’ and fear we will lose vital parts of the game.</p>
<p>Explaining this in full is beyond scope here. I’ll give a small sketch.</p>
<p>When I play with a sideboard, I pay close attention to everything in the first two games, both in limited and constructed. What cards has the opponent played? What style are they playing? How skilled are they? Is the matchup good or bad? Should I be playing it safe or going for variance, both with play and mulligans and with my sideboard? Could they transform, and if they can, will they? What cards have I shown to them? Can I play so as to avoid showing them anything more, or show them things which will be misleading or taken out? Can I coax them into showing me more cards? How much should that trade off against a slightly better chance of winning?</p>
<p>I love it when players make a weird move <em>just to see what the opponent does in that type of situation, in case it comes up in another game. </em></p>
<p>Having a sideboard gives the players small things to think about. In a way it’s like having a score or achievements, and having an outer loop to the game. I get to care about more than win or lose. Thus, every turn, every action matters and is worth thinking about. Worth remembering. You get an experience. You also feel like you played against a real human. And when the cards go against you, or you mess up, you know you get a chance to redeem yourself, and to use what you have learned.</p>
<p>When I play best of one, the games blur together. This set of moves again, and again. Rote responses, because you lack the information to improve your choices. A binary outcome except for time spent, with a huge desire to ‘get on with it’ once the outcome looks clear. Time starts to be something you’re sending rather than something you’re <em>enjoying. </em>What was fun becomes a grind.</p>
<p>When I switched on Arena from best-of-one back to best-of-three, it was a sea change in my experience. I was having so much more fun.</p>
<p>Thus, even if <em>strategically </em>everything would be fine, and the decks stayed the same, I would strongly oppose losing or minimizing sideboards for experiential reasons.</p>
<p>The decks don’t stay the same.</p>
<p>What we get in best of one are lots of decks that are simple and linear. Decks that do one thing hard, and do them well, repeating patterns over and over. The decks where you used to say ‘I’ll have a sideboard ready for them’ are now most of your opponents. A burning sea of red, or an endless ocean of blue or plain of white. The more we turn games into grinds, the more we see this, even with best of three. When the last few days of Mythic play came in February we saw a dramatic rise in mono-red, and mono-white did much better than it does in normal play. With best-of-one this gets doubly reinforced and thus turbo charged.</p>
<p>Balance becomes far more difficult. I’ve talked <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2019/01/21/game-analysis-index/"">a bunch about this recently</a> (link is to my game analysis index). Sideboards, and cards that are very strong in some places but weak in others, are how card games naturally balance. If you have strong answers to everything, you are safe even when the strategies are not naturally equally strong. That’s what keeps Modern playing well most of the time. Standard by contrast has suffered a lot of periods in the last few years with one deck proving impossible to get an advantage against even in best of three. With the best cards designed to be flexible, we get decks that play great ‘good stuff’ mid-range style Magic and have the tools to handle everything. Any reasonable configuration of other colors turns out to be worse, because when everything is good at everything, whoever is best at it wins.</p>
<p>Taking away sideboards entirely makes that problem that much worse.</p>
<p>Standard right now is in a relatively great place. But it still has a handful of popular decks that get tiresome to play against. Take away all attention to detail, and opportunities for those details to compound and matter, and focus even more on the strongest linear strategies and the decks that respond to them, and the games turn into a grind.</p>
<p>Thus, I am rooting against the format this weekend. Let’s put on a great show. But not <em>too </em>great a show.</p>

<p>I've been <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/qezBTig6p6p5xtL6G/a-theory-of-human-values"">working on a way of synthesising the preferences of a single given human</a>.</p>
<p>After this is done, there is the business of combining these utilities into a single utility function for the whole human population. One obvious way of doing this is to weigh the different utilities by some individual measure of intensity, then add them together, and maximise the sum.</p>
<p>But there are some arguments against this. For example, a lot of people's preferences is over the behaviour or experiences of other people. This includes things like promoting religious or cultural beliefs (and this can cover preferences like wanting others to have basic human rights or to be free from oppressive situations).</p>
<p>Apart from simple summing, which may result in an excessive strength to a majority, there are two other obvious solutions: the first is to remove preferences over other people entirely. Note that this would also remove most preferences over social and cultural systems. The other one is to remove any anti-altruistic components to the system: preferences over the suffering of others are no longer valid (note this would allow punishment-as-a-deterrence, or punishment-as-retribution-to-a-victim, but not punishment-as-abstract-justice). This may be a bit tricky to define - what's the clear difference between wanting to be of higher status and wanting others to be of lower status? - but might be a desirable compromise. It might, indeed, be the kind of compromise that different people would ""negotiate to"" in some sort of ""moral parliament"" example, since people often tend to prefer their own individual desires over desires to control other people, so this might be a solution that would have majority support.</p>

<p>I've <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/kgQCpiuHwDWNgz7E4/preferences-over-non-rewards"">given examples</a> of preferences over non-rewards.</p>
<p>But those examples are easy to dismiss as irrational or imposing on others, as they involved religion, or things like preferences over other people knowing the truth.</p>
<p>But if we think in terms of <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/MxLK2fvEuijAYgsc2/smoothmin-and-personal-identity"">preferences over personal identity</a>, we have far more widespread and natural examples of this.</p>
<p>One small example: in most murder-mysteries, I'd prefer not to know the identity of the killer at the beginning of the show. If I'm taking part in a murder mystery dinner, I'd definitely not want too. If I'm playing games of hidden information for fun, then I would not want to know all the hidden information - or else that makes this pointless. Lots of people enjoy watching sport events live; much less people re-watch random past sporting events whose result they already know. Eliezer talks about the <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/KfMNFB3G7XNviHBPN/joy-in-discovery"">joy in scientific discovery</a>.</p>
<p>So preferences over non-rewards are quite natural and common.</p>
<h2>Hedonism solution?</h2>
<p>Now, you could say you don't have a ""preferences over knowing/not knowing something"", but that you ""enjoy the experience of learning"", and thus reduce the whole thing to hedonism. Eliezer <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/synsRtBKDeAFuo7e3/not-for-the-sake-of-happiness-alone"">argues against this</a>, claiming to have preferences that don't reduce to hedonism (preferences I share, incidentally).</p>
<p>But even fully giving in to hedonism only partially solves the problem; yes, we can model someone's faith as saying they enjoy the experience of belief, and murder-mystery watchers enjoy the experience of seeing intricate puzzles solved. But this doesn't solve the problem that, to maximise hedonic experience, we still have to control what knowledge the human has.</p>

Zvi <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2019/02/19/blackmail/"">seems to think</a>, to the contrary, that it's prima facie bad.
<a href=""http://www.overcomingbias.com/2019/02/checkmate-on-blackmail.html"">Robin Hanson argued</a>: If there exists some information about someone that, if revealed, would cause people to coordinate to punish them, then it's good for this information to be revealed because on average it's good for such people to be punished. Blackmail rewards people for investigating covert illicit behavior that would otherwise remain undetected, and correspondingly punishes the people engaging in that behavior.
Zvi offered two interesting arguments against this, which I'll address one at a time.</p>
<h1>The argument against leverage</h1>
<p>First, Zvi responded that blackmail is obviously bad because it creates the incentive to pressure people into covertly behaving in ways that would get them in trouble if revealed, in order to to have leverage over them - which can then be used to force more covert bad behavior for yet more leverage. When done at scale, this can lead to both large amounts of bad behavior which would not have otherwise occurred, and large levels of extraction.
People can get away with subtle and indirect blackmail already. But so long as it's technically illegal, repeated leveraged blackmail at scale is not a feasible strategy; a large firm specializing in blackmail would quickly become unpopular, and the target of regulatory scrutiny.
This argument assumes a prior state where some agents already have enough leverage over most people to force them to engage in mildly illicit behavior. But any agent in a position to do that could easily use their leverage to force their victim to extract some sort of perfectly legal further leverage, such as borrowing at a high rate of interest, or making their lifestyle depend increasingly on some core bottleneck controlled by the extortionist. This too constrains the victim to do what the extortionist says, lest they default on their obligation and lose everything.&lt;br/&gt;This argument against blackmail is not specific to blackmail, but seems instead to be a general consideration against capitalism, privatization, and doing business at scale - since these empower positive feedback loops of rent-seeking behavior.</p>
<h1>The argument against information</h1>
<p>Zvi also offers an argument that is more purely targeted against blackmail. Even without leveraged schemes to manufacture ever-increasing amounts of illicit behavior as the raw material for blackmail, allowing blackmailers to go into business at scale would increase the total amount of blackmail performed, extracting large amounts of wealth from people doing perfectly ordinary illicit things. Most of us do things that we would be punished for if they were revealed, and it can't be good to take money away from nearly everyone, so we shouldn't legalize blackmail.
Crucially, Zvi treats revealing the information as a net harm here. It's even worse, on his model, than extracting money from the victim; it's a deadweight loss, harm inflicted on the victim with no corresponding benefit to the blackmailer.
This argument fails in a more interesting way, since it denies the fundamental premise of Hanson's argument: that we benefit both from finding out about illicit acts, and by punishing them. Zvi instead seems to think that if society as a whole were better-informed about what people were doing, it would in general on average make worse decisions, by punishing more people who ought not to be punished.
Licit blackmail at scale wouldn't just punish people for hypocrisy - it would reveal the underlying rate of hypocrisy. Soon, everyone would know that it's an ordinary part of life to pay off blackmailers. People would have a general idea what sort of behavior is blackmailable, because the behavior of the occasional person who refuses to pay would be revealed.
In a society that's trying at all to do a sensible thing, we should expect two things to happen in response to this situation. First, by effectively taxing illicit behavior, we should expect get less of it. Second, once people find out how common certain kinds of illicit behavior are, we should expect the penalties to be reduced.
Zvi counts both of these as costs, not benefits. But for more reliable punishment of and more frequent revelation of illicit behavior to be harmful, society has to be trying to get the wrong answer.
If you think that people are worse off when better informed - if our society is that perverse - then it's not clear what we're doing when we pretend to offer consequentialist arguments on policy decisions like whether to legalize blackmail. The general consideration that you expect people to make better decisions when better informed doesn't apply here.</p>
<h1>Hoping for or against justice</h1>
<p>Zvi's argument isn't analytically rigorous - it appeals to an implied shared feeling about blackmail. He doesn't articulate a clear model of how the relevant parts of the system work, and then show that in equilibrium, the harms caused by legalizing blackmail outweigh its benefits. He doesn't even assess its benefits. He just tells a vivid story about some possible costs it could impose.
I notice I'm inclined to do the opposite - focus on ways blackmail repairs problems. I think this reflects two very different perspectives on how justice relates to hypocrisy (though I'm used to seeing Zvi on my side on this issue and am still a bit surprised we seem to be disagreeing here).
In the traditional Latin mass, judgment day is described as a catastrophe from which the singer seeks refuge:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dies irae, dies illa <br>
Solvet saeclum in favilla, <br>
Teste David cum Sibylla.</p>
<p>Quantus tremor est futurus, <br>
Quando judex est venturus, <br>
Cuncta stricte discussurus!</p>
<p>Tuba mirum spargens sonum <br>
Per sepulcra regionum, <br>
Coget omnes ante thronum.</p>
<p>Mors stupebit et natura, <br>
Cum resurget creatura, <br>
Judicanti responsura.</p>
<p>Liber scriptus proferetur, <br>
In quo totum continetur, <br>
Unde mundus judicetur.</p>
<p>Judex ergo cum sedebit, <br>
Quidquid latet apparebit. <br>
Nil inultum remanebit.</p>
<p>Quid sum miser tunc dicturus? <br>
Quem patronum rogaturus, <br>
Cum vix justus sit securus?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's an approximate translation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The day of wrath, that day <br>
shall dissolve the world in ashes, <br>
testifies David with the Sibyl.</p>
<p>What trembling there will be <br>
When the judge shall come <br>
to weigh everything strictly!</p>
<p>The wondrous trumpet scattering sound <br>
Across the graves of all the regions <br>
Calls all before the throne.</p>
<p>Death and nature shall be stupefied <br>
When Creation arises <br>
Responsive to the Judge.</p>
<p>A written book shall be proffered <br>
In which all is contained <br>
Whereby the world shall be judged</p>
<p>When the judge takes his seat <br>
all that is hidden shall appear <br>
Nothing will remain unavenged.</p>
<p>What shall I, a wretch, say then? <br>
To which patron shall I appeal <br>
When even the just man is barely secure?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Jewish liturgy about divine judgment can be quite different. Every week, at the beginning of the Sabbath, Jews around the world sing Psalms a collection of psalms focused on the idea that the world is rejoicing because God is finally coming to judge it.</p>
<p>From Psalm 96:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Say among the nations that the&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;reigns: the world shall so be established that it shall not be moved: he shall judge the peoples with uprightnesses.&nbsp;Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the sea roar, and its fullness.&nbsp;Let the field be joyful, and all that is in it: then shall all the trees of the wood sing for joy.&nbsp;Before the&nbsp;Lord: for he comes, for he comes to judge the land: he shall judge the world with justice, and the peoples in his faithfulness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From Psalm 98:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Melodize to the Lord with harp; with harp, and melodic voice. With the trumpets, and the voice of the horn, shout before the king, the Lord. Let the sea roar, and its fullness; the world, and those who dwell in it. Rivers shall clap their hands; together, the mountains shall sing for joy. Before the&nbsp;Lord: for he comes, for he comes to judge the land: he shall judge the world with justice, and the peoples in his faithfulness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In one of these outlooks, humans can't behave well enough to stand up to pure justice, so we should put off the day of judgment for as long as we can, and seek protection. In the other, the world is groaning under the accumulated weight of hypocrisy and sin, and only the reconciliation of accounts can free us; in constant flux due to ever-shifting stories, which can only be stabilized by a true judge.</p>
<p>We can't reconcile accounts if that means punishing all bad behavior according to the current hypocritical regime's schedule of punishments. But a true reconciliation also means adjusting the punishments to a level where we'd be happy, not sad, to see them applied consistently. (Sometimes the correct punishment is nothing beyond the accounting itself.)</p>
<p>In worlds where hypocrisy is normal, honesty is punished, since the most honest people will tend to reveal deprecatory information others might conceal, and be punished for it. We get less of what we punish. But honesty isn't just a weird quirk - it's the only way to get to the stars.</p>

<ol>
<li>A way of defining the basic preferences (and basic meta-preferences) of a given human, even if these are under-defined or situational.</li>
<li>A method for synthesising such basic preferences into a single utility function or similar object.</li>
<li>A guarantee we won't end up in a terrible place, due to noise or different choices in the two definitions above.</li>
</ol>
<p>To summarise this post, I sketch out methods for 1. and 2., and look at what 3. might look like, and what we can expect from such a guarantee, and some of the issues with it.</p>
<h1>Basic human preferences</h1>
<p>For the first point, I'm defining a basic preference as existing within the <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/kmLP3bTnBhc22DnqY/beyond-algorithmic-equivalence-self-modelling"">mental</a> <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/rcXaY3FgoobMkH2jc/figuring-out-what-alice-wants-part-ii"">models</a> <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/YfQGZderiaGv3kBJ8/figuring-out-what-alice-wants-non-human-alice"">of a human</a>.</p>
<p>Any preference judgement within that model - that some outcome was better than another, that some action was a mistake, that some behaviour was foolish, that someone is to be feared - is defined to be a basic preference.</p>
<p>Basic meta-preferences work in the same way, with meta-preferences just defined to be preferences over preferences (or over methods of synthesising preferences). Also include <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/kgQCpiuHwDWNgz7E4/preferences-over-non-rewards"">odd meta-preferences</a> here - such as preferences over beliefs. I'll try to transform these odd preferences in ""<a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/MxLK2fvEuijAYgsc2/smoothmin-and-personal-identity"">identity preferences</a>"": preferences over the kind of person you want to be.</p>
<h2>""Reasonable"" situations</h2>
<p>To define that, we need to define the class of ""reasonable"" situations in which to have these mental models. These could be real situations (Mrs X thought that she'd like some sushi as she went past the restaurant) or counterfactual (if Mr Y had gone past that restaurant, he would have wanted sushi). The ""<a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/i6hWWcKyxBPj7ELT6/one-step-hypotheticals"">one-step hypotheticals post</a>"" is about defining these reasonable situations.</p>
<p>Anything that occurs outside of a reasonable situation is discarded as not indicative of genuine basic human preference; this is due to the fact that humans can be persuaded to endorse/unendorse almost anything in the right situation (eg by <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=994"">drugs</a> or <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ANupXf8XfZo2EJxGv/humans-can-be-assigned-any-values-whatsoever"">brain surgery</a>, if all else fails).</p>
<p>We can have preferences and meta-preferences <strong>over</strong> non-reasonable situations  (what to do in a world where plants were conscious?), as long as these preferences and meta-preferences were expressed <strong>in</strong> reasonable situations. We can have a <a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Coherent_Extrapolated_Volition"">CEV</a> style meta-preference (""I wish my preferences were more like what a CEV would generate""), but, apart from that, the preferences a CEV would generate are not directly relevant: the situations where ""we knew more, thought faster, were more the people we wished we were, had grown up farther together"" are highly non-typical.</p>
<p>We would not want the AI itself manipulating the definition of ""reasonable"" situations. It's for this that I've looked into ways of quantifying and removing AI <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/b8HauRWrjBdnKEwM5/rigging-is-a-form-of-wireheading"">rigging</a> and <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1101"">influencing</a> of the learning process.</p>
<h1>Synthesising human preferences</h1>
<p>The simple preferences and meta-preferences constructed above will be often wildly contradictory (eg we want to be generous and rich), inconsistent across time, and generally underdefined. They can also be weakly or strongly held.</p>
<p>The important thing now is to synthesise all of these into some adequate overall reward or utility function. Not because utility functions are intrinsically good, but because they are stable: if you're not an expected utility maximiser, events may likely push you <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ZTN6bLWqpwWn2i4qZ/money-pumping-the-axiomatic-approach"">into becoming one</a>. And it's much better to start off with an adequate utility function, than to hope that <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/WeAt5TeS8aYc4Cpms/values-determined-by-stopping-properties"">random-drift-until-our-goals-are-stable</a> will get us to an adequate outcome.</p>
<h2>Synthesising the preference utility function</h2>
<p>The idea is to start with three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>A way of resolving contradictions between preferences (and between meta-preferences, and so on).</li>
<li>A way of applying meta-preferences to preferences (endorsing and anti-endorsing other preferences).</li>
<li>A way of allowing (relevant) meta-preferences to change the methods used in the two points above.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Y2LhX3925RodndwpC/resolving-human-values-completely-and-adequately"">This post</a> showed one method of doing that, with contradictions resolved by weighting the reward/utility function for each preference and then adding them together linearly. The weights were proportional to some measure of the intensity of each preference.</p>
<p>In a more <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/MxLK2fvEuijAYgsc2/smoothmin-and-personal-identity"">recent post</a>, I realised that linear addition may not be the natural thing to do for some types of preferences (which I dubbed ""identity"" preferences). The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_maximum"">smooth minimum</a> gives another way of combining utilities, though it needs a natural zero as well as a weight. So the human's model of the status quo is relevant here. For preferences combined in a smoothmin, we can just reset the natural zero (raising it to make the preference less important, lowering it to make it more) rather than changing the weight.</p>
<p>I'm distinguishing between identity and world preferences, but the real distinction is between preferences that humans prefer to combine linearly, and those they prefer to combine in a smoothmin. So it could work that along with preference and weight (and natural zero), one thing we could ask of basic preferences is whether they should go in the linear of the smoothmin group.</p>
<p>Also, though I'm very willing to let a linear preference get sent to zero if the human's meta-preferences unendorse them, I'm less sure about those in the other group; it's possible that unendorsing of a smoothmin preference should raise the ""natural zero"" rather than sending the preference to zero. After all, we've identified these preferences as key parts of our identity, even though we unendorse them.</p>
<h2>Meta-changes to the synthesis method</h2>
<p>Then finally, on point 3 above, the relevant human meta-preferences can change the synthesis process. Heavily weighted meta-preferences of this type will result in completely different processes than described above; lightly weighted meta-preferences will make only small changes. <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Y2LhX3925RodndwpC/resolving-human-values-completely-and-adequately"">The original post</a> looked into that in more detail.</p>
<p>Notice that I am making some deliberate and somewhat arbitrary choices: using linear or smoothmin to combine meta-preferences (including those that might want to change the methods of combinations). How much weight a meta-preference must have, before it seriously changes the synthesis method, is somewhat arbitrary.</p>
<p>I'm also starting with two types of preference combinations, linear and smoothmin, rather than many more or just one. The idea is that these two way of combining preferences seem the most salient to me, and our own meta-values can change these ways if we feel strongly about them. It's as if I'm starting the design of a formula one car, before an AI trains itself to complete the design. I know it'll change a lot of things, but if I start with ""four wheels, a cockpit and a motor"", I'm hoping to get them started on the right path, even if they eventually overrule me.</p>
<p>Or, if you prefer, I think starting with this design is more likely to nudge a bad outcome into a good one, than to do the opposite.</p>
<h1>Non-terrible outcomes</h1>
<p>Now for the most tricky part of this: given the above, can we expect non-terrible outcomes?</p>
<p>This is a difficult question to answer, because ""terrible outcomes"" remains undefined (if we had a full definition, it could serve a utility function itself), and, in a sense, there is no principled trade-off between two preferences: the only general optimality measure is Pareto, and that can be reached by <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/W2ufY8ihDDWWqJA7h/if-you-don-t-know-the-name-of-the-game-just-tell-me-what-i"">any linear combination of utilities</a>.</p>
<h2>Scope insensitivity to the rescue?</h2>
<p>There are two obvious senses in which an outcome could be terrible:</p>
<ol>
<li>We could lose something of great value, never to have it again.</li>
<li>We could fall drastically short of maximising a utility function to the upmost.</li>
</ol>
<p>From the perspective of a utility maximiser, both these outcomes could be equally terrible - it's just a question of computing the expected utility difference between the two scenarios.</p>
<p>However, for actual humans, the first scenario seems to loom <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/GNnHHmm8EzePmKzPk/value-is-fragile"">much larger</a>. This can be seen as a form of <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/2ftJ38y9SRBCBsCzy/scope-insensitivity"">scope insensitivity</a>: we might say that we believe in total utilitarianism, but we don't feel that a <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""(""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">(</span></span></span></span><style>.mjx-chtml {display: inline-block; line-height: 0; text-indent: 0; text-align: left; text-transform: none; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 100%; font-size-adjust: none; letter-spacing: normal; word-wrap: normal; word-spacing: normal; white-space: nowrap; float: none; direction: ltr; max-width: none; max-height: none; min-width: 0; min-height: 0; border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 1px 0}

<p>Now, we might deplore that state of affairs (that deploring is a valid meta-preference), but that does seem to be how human work. And though there are <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/3wYTFWY3LKQCnAptN/torture-vs-dust-specks"">arguments</a> against scope insensitivity for actually existent beings, it is <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Ee29dFnPhaeRmYdMy/example-population-ethics-ordered-discounted-utility"">perfectly consistent</a> to <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/pyTuR4ZbLfqpS2oMh/a-small-critique-of-total-utilitarianism"">reject them</a> when considering whether we have a duty to create new beings.</p>
<p>What this means is that people's preferences seem much closer to smooth minimums than to linear sums. Some are explicitly setup like that from the beginning (those that go in the smoothmin bucket). Others may be like that in practice, either because meta-preferences want them to be, or because of the vast size of the future: see next section.</p>
<h2>The size of the future</h2>
<p>The future is <a href=""http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/intergalactic-spreading.pdf"">vast</a>, with the energy of billions of galaxies, efficiently used, at our disposal. Potentially far, far larger than that, if we're <a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.03394.pdf"">clever</a> about our computations.</p>
<p>That means that it's far easier to reach ""agreement"" between two utility functions with diminishing marginal returns (as most of them will be, in practice and in theory). Even without diminishing marginal returns, and without using smoothmin, it's unlikely that one utility function will remain highest marginal returns all the way up to all resources being used up. At some point, benefiting a tiny little preference slightly will likely be easier.</p>
<p>The exception of this is if preferences are explicitly opposed to each other; eg masochism versus pain-reduction. But even there, they are unlikely to be completely and exactly negations of one another. The masochist may find some activities that don't fit perfectly under ""increased pain"" as traditionally understood, so some compromise between the two preferences becomes possible.</p>
<p>The underdefined nature of some preference may be an boon here; if <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""X""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.024em;"">X</span></span></span></span></span></span> is forbidden, but only in situations in <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\mathcal{S}""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-texatom""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-cal-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.372em; padding-right: 0.036em;"">S</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>, then going outside of <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\mathcal{S}""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-texatom""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-cal-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.372em; padding-right: 0.036em;"">S</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> may allow the <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""X""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.024em;"">X</span></span></span></span></span></span>-loving preferences their space to grow. So, for example, obeying promises might become a general value, but we might allow games, masked balls, or similar situation where lying is allowed, because the advantages of honesty - reputation, ease of coordination - are deliberately absent.</p>
<h2>Growth, learning, and following your own preferences</h2>
<p>I've argued that our values and preference <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4H8N3fEfXQmzxSaRo/upcoming-stability-of-values"">will soon become stable</a> as we start to self modify.</p>
<p>This is going to be hard for those who put an explicit premium on continual moral growth. Now, it's still possible to have continued moral change withing a narrow band, but</p>
<p>Finally, there's the issue of what happens when the AI tells you ""here is <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""U""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.084em;"">U</span></span></span></span></span></span>, the synthesis of your preferences"", and you go ""well, I have all these problems with it"". Since humans are often contrarian by nature, it may be impossible for an AI to construct a <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""U""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.084em;"">U</span></span></span></span></span></span> that we would ever explicitly endorse. This is a sort of ""self-reference"" problem in synthesising preferences.</p>
<h2>Tolerance levels</h2>
<p>The whole design - with an initial framework, liberal use of smoothmin, a default for standard combinations of preferences, and a vast amount of resources available - is designed to reach an adequate, rather than an optimal solution. Optimal solutions are very subject to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law"">Goodhart's law</a> if we don't include everything we care about; if we do include everything we care about, the process <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/urZzJPwHtjewdKKHc/using-expected-utility-for-good-hart"">may come to resemble</a> the one I've defined here, above.</p>
<p>Conversely, if the human fear that such a synthesis will become badly behaved in certain extreme situations - then that fear will be included in the synthesis. And, if the fear is strong enough, will serve to direct the outcomes away from those extreme situations.</p>
<p>So the whole design is somewhat tolerant to changes in the initial conditions: different starting points may end up in different end points, but all of them will hopefully be acceptable.</p>
<h1>Did I think of everything?</h1>
<p>With all such methods, there's the risk of not including everything, so ending up in a terrible point by omission. That risk is certainly there, but it seems that we couldn't end up in a terrible hellworlds, or at least no in one that could be meaningfully described/summarised to the human (because avoiding hellworlds is high on human preference and meta-preferences, and there is little explicit force pushing the other way).</p>
<p>And I've argued that it's unlikely that <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/rArsypGqq49bk4iRr/can-there-be-an-indescribable-hellworld"">indescribable hellworlds are even possible</a>.</p>
<p>However, there are still a lot of holes to fill, and I have to ensure that this doesn't just end up as a series of patches until I can't think of any further patches. That's my greatest fear, and I'm not yet sure how to address it.</p>

<p>In my (Jacob's) work at <a href=""https://goo.gl/forms/gMGGGtGYHztYJJ2s2"">Metaculus AI</a>, I'm trying to build a centralised space for both finding forecasts as well as the reasoning underlying those forecasts.

<p>However, we are also concerned with situations where new forecasters overweight the current crowd opinion in their forecasts, compared to the underlying evidence, and see this as major risk for the trustworthiness of forecasts to those working in AI safety and policy.</p>
<p>With this question, I am interested in previous attempts to tackle this problem, and how successful they have been. In particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What existing infrastructure has been historically effective for avoiding info-cascades in communities? (Examples could include short-selling to prevent bubbles in asset markets, or norms to share the causes rather than outputs of one’s beliefs)</p>

<p>What problems are not adequately addressed by such infrastructure?</p>

While we currently didn't have the time to continue exploring, we wanted to experiment with seeing how much the LW community could together build on top of our preliminary search, so we’ve put up a basic prize for more work and tried to structure the work around a couple of open questions. This is an experiment! We’re looking forward to reading any of your contributions to the topic, including things like summaries of existing literature and building out new models of the domain.</em></p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Consider the following situation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bob is wondering whether a certain protein injures the skeletal muscle of patients with a rare disease. He finds a handful papers with some evidence for the claim (and some with evidence against it), so he simply states the claim in his paper, with some caution, and adds that as a citation. Later, Alice comes across Bob’s paper and sees the cited claim, and she proceeds to cite Bob, but without tracing the citation trail back to the original evidence. This keeps happening, in various shapes and forms, and after a while a literature of hundreds of papers builds up where it’s common knowledge that β amyloid injures the skeletal muscle of patients with inclusion body myositis -- without the claim having accumulated any more evidence. (This real example was taken from <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2714656/"">Greenberg, 2009</a>, which is a case study of this event.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An information-cascade occurs when people update on each others beliefs, rather than sharing the causes of those beliefs, and those beliefs end up with a vestige of support that far outstrips the evidence for them. Satvik Beri might describe this as the problem of only sharing the outputs of your thinking process, not your inputs.</p>
<p>The dynamics here are perhaps reminiscent of those underlying various failures of collective rationality such as asset bubbles, bystander effects and stampedes.</p>
<p>Note that his effect is different from other problems of collective rationality like the replication crisis, which involve <em>low standards</em> for evidence (such as unreasonably lax p-value thresholds or coordination problems preventing publishing of failed experiments), or the degeneracy of much online discussion, which involves tribal signalling and UI encouraging <a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/17/the-toxoplasma-of-rage/"">problematic selection effects</a>. Rather, information cascades involve people <em>rationally updating</em> without <em>any</em> object-level evidence at all, and would persist even if the replication crisis and online outrage culture disappeared. If nobody lies or tells untruths, you can still be subject to an information cascade.</p>
<h2>Questions</h2>
<p>Ben and I are confused about how to think about the negative effects of this problem. We understand the basic idea, but aren't sure how to reason quantitatively about the impacts, and how to trade-off solving these problems in a community versus doing other improvements to overall efficacy and efficiency of a community. We currently know only how to think about these qualitatively.</p>
<p>We’re posting a couple of related questions that we have some initial thoughts on, that might help clarify the problem.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/FuqxhhhNAPNz5tGA4/distribution-of-info-cascades-across-fields-info-cascade"">How common, and how large, are info-cascades in communities that seek to make intellectual progress, such as academia?</a></p>

</li>
<li>

</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have something you’d like to contribute, but that doesn’t seem to fit into the related questions above, leave it as an answer to this question.</p>
<h2>Bounties</h2>
<p>We are committing to pay at least <strong>either $800 or (No. of answers and comments * $25), whichever is smaller,</strong> for work on this problem recorded on LW, done before May 13th. The prize pool will be split across comments in accordance with how valuable we find them, and we might make awards earlier than the deadline (though if you know you’ll put in work in x weeks, it would be good to mention that to one of us via PM).</p>
<p>Ben and Jacob are each responsible for half of the prize money.</p>
<p>Jacob is funding this through Metaculus AI, a new forecasting platform tracking and improving the state-of-the-art in AI forecasting, partly to help avoid info-cascades in the AI safety and policy communities (we’re currently live and inviting beta-users, you can sign-up <a href=""https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSduBjn3W_MpHHjsKUEhzV6Krkup78ujE5-8bpNJ5HDE7GGnmA/viewform?usp=sf_link"">here</a>).</p>

They particularly found things I wrote in this series useful, and of the two series I agree that this is likely the more useful one, the former being reposted mainly because this one occasionally references it. If you are familiar with LW much you probably don&#x27;t need to read the first post.</p><p>As I also said in the first post, this is old content that I no longer entirely endorse, although I think most of it remains useful and surprisingly skillful advice given how little I knew back then. I&#x27;ve been about 7 different people between when I wrote these posts and now, to give you some idea of the distance I&#x27;m suggesting I have from it. Nonetheless, I think learning to master the topics I discuss here is pretty essential if you want to attain to at least whatever level of mastery I&#x27;ve achieved at being a human, much else besides not included.</p><p>I hope these words treat you well.</p><hr class=""dividerBlock""/><h1>finding your way</h1><p>having now a good sense of <a href=""http://gworley3.github.io/mapmaking/maps-make-meaning.html"">maps</a> and <a href=""http://gworley3.github.io/mapmaking/map-making.html"">mapmaking</a>, we can begin to use our maps to find our way through the territory. this requires more than the skill of map reading, which is implicit to mapmaking. you need the skill of the wayfinding: finding your way through the territory to a destination.</p><p>what sort of destination? the kinds of destinations that exist in the territory: possible future worlds states you could find yourself in. for example, hungry? find your way to eating a sandwich. thirsty? find your way to drinking a glass of water. ennui? find you way to having a life&#x27;s purpose. to put it in a story:</p><blockquote>you are trying to go to your friend&#x27;s house. you have a map that shows you that to get there you need to walk down the street, though a patch of brush, past an angry dog, and then up a narrow lane with your friend&#x27;s house at the end. the map tells you where to go, but just reading that map is not enough to get you there.</blockquote><blockquote>you know how to walk down the street just fine, but when you come to the brush just knowing you must go through it is not enough: you have to know how to clear a path through it. and if you try to pass by the angry dog he&#x27;ll probably bite you, so you also have to know how to approach the dog to keep him from attacking. only then do you get to go up the narrow lane to reach your friend&#x27;s house.</blockquote><p>when put this way it may seem obvious that wayfinding is a skill apart from map reading, yet many people fail to notice this because they don&#x27;t really know how to make meaning of wayfinding beyond map reading, especially when the metaphor is less clearly laid out.</p><p>suppose you want to lose weight, and further suppose, science aside, that weight loss is a simple matter of eating fewer calories than you use each day. in this case you know exactly what the map looks like: you eat less and do more so that calories in are less than calories out. great! having read the map, you have now lost the weight. only it doesn&#x27;t work like that. you somehow have to use this knowledge of the map to lose weight. this is the skill of wayfinding: taking what you read in the map to actually get somewhere.</p><p>this is what makes wayfinding the first gap you must cross to move beyond mapmaking. it&#x27;s not enough to read the map: you have to do things in order to move based on what you have read in your map. following the winning way requires that you not only make a map that helps you win, but also using the map to help you win.</p><h1>natural wayfinding</h1><p>although <a href=""http://gworley3.github.io/wayfinding/finding-your-way.html"">wayfinding is not as simple as map reading</a>, it&#x27;s still a skill you are already surprisingly good at. most of the ways in which you are not good at wayfinding are because you don&#x27;t have a <a href=""http://gworley3.github.io/mapmaking/map-making.html"">good map of the territory</a> or because you find yourself in situations more complicated than those your <a href=""http://www.cep.ucsb.edu/primer.html"">ancestors evolved to handle</a>. but because you already have excellent natural skills, we should look for ways to amplify them so that they work in the modern world.</p><p>this is, in essence, the whole story on wayfinding: the rest is just details.</p><p>but details are never &#x27;just&#x27; details: they&#x27;re the information you need to know. so let&#x27;s begin by considering the things you are already good at in terms of wayfinding. the core of your skills boil down to these:</p><ul><li>you can focus your attention</li><li>you can automatically prioritize</li><li>you can hold thoughts in your mind</li><li>you can remember old thoughts</li></ul><p>you may not appreciate how amazingly good you are at these processes because you regularly hit their limits, but consider that all the time every day you make millions of decisions by automatically and unconsciously prioritizing possible future actions, base those priorities on what you are thinking and what you have thought in the past, and then execute on those decisions without being constantly distracted by the hundreds of bits of sensory input you receive each second. most of the universe, and even most living things, can&#x27;t do that.</p><p>why do you sometimes drink water? not ultimately, but proximally how do you come to drink water? first, your body senses a lack of water through one of many possible mechanisms, so let&#x27;s suppose here that your mouth is dry. this produces a &#x27;thirsty feeling&#x27; thought about needing to drink water. remembering there is a glass of water near you, you choose (even if it happens below the level of consciousness) to lift the glass of water and take a sip. while drinking this water you are automatically ignoring most of your sensory input to focus only on the senses you need to help you take the drink. you continue drinking until the &#x27;thirsty feeling&#x27; thought is prioritized under some other thought, like the &#x27;take a breath&#x27; thought, at which point the choice process has already begun again.</p><p>this story about water drinking is highly stylized: there are many details excluded, mostly because we don&#x27;t even understand all the details. but the point remains that you have an incredible ability to make complex choices based on a massive amount of information. to the extent you can get better at wayfinding, we&#x27;ll be looking for ways to take these natural skills and build something more powerful out of them.</p><h1>finding focus</h1><p>although we have <a href=""http://gworley3.github.io/wayfinding/natural-wayfinding.html"">marveled</a> at the power of our natural wayfinding skills, if we are to improve upon them we must acknowledge their limits so we can build systems to do more than we could on our own. thankfully the limits of human cognition are great fodder for academic research, so we know quite a bit about the edges of attention, choice, and memory. we&#x27;ll consider each in turn, so let&#x27;s start with the most fundamental of all to getting things done: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention"">focus and attention</a>.</p><p>focus is limited and heavily influenced by environmental, metabolic, and psychological factors. this is well known, but it bears repeating because many of us do a bad job of acting on this information when we need to focus.</p><p>the simplest things to deal with are the environmental aspects of focus. in terms of environment, everyone is a bit different, but i think we can summarize an environment conductive to focus as:</p><ul><li>free of distractions</li><li>calm</li><li>cognitively untaxing</li></ul><p>some might object that they focus well in chaotic environments. they feel like they get more done there than in a quiet room. i have no objection to this and see it as just another version of a distraction-free, clam, comprehensible environment. maybe quiet distracts you? fine, add some noise. maybe being alone is distracting. fine, add some people. the point is to find an environment in which you are minimally taxed by having to deal with the environment. you should feel comfortable and able to pay attention to what you want rather than what you are made to.</p><p>metabolic aspects of focus are a bit trickier, but still relatively straight forward. at the high level, the things you need to be able to focus are:</p><ul><li>enough sleep</li><li>sufficient nutrition</li><li>healthy physical condition</li></ul><p>sleep probably has the most impact on attention. adults <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/17/magazine/mag-17Sleep-t.html"">need</a> between 4 and 12 hours per day at the extremes, with 8 hours average and 6 to 10 hours <a href=""http://apsychoserver.psych.arizona.edu/jjbareprints/psyc501a/readings/Carskadon%20Dement%202011.pdf"">typical</a>. whether that sleep is all in one block or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmented_sleep"">segmented</a>, getting enough sleep is mostly about creating an environment where you are ready for sleep and have enough time to sleep the amount you need. being ready for sleep means reducing lighting, avoiding physical activity, and relaxing a few hours before bed. if for some reason you can&#x27;t get enough sleep, a sleep therapist might prescribe you a stimulant to help you stay awake or a sleeping aide to help you get more sleep.</p><p>in addition to sleep, nutrition is important to attention, specifically your general nutrition and the balance of chemicals in your body when you try to focus. you need to consume a good balance of fats, proteins, carbohydrates, and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine_deficiency#Deficiency"">micronutrients</a> in order to meet all your body&#x27;s needs. if you don&#x27;t you may feel tired, lethargic, or have distracting symptoms that result from <a href=""http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/malnutrition.html"">malnutrition</a>. and because your brain is the most energy-hungry organ in your body but also one of the least critical to continued life, your brain is one of the first things to suffer when you are malnourished. further, your brain needs readily available energy in the form of sugar, so good focus also means having readily available sugar in your body. if you eat well your body should handle this for you, but if it doesn&#x27;t you may need to eat fruits or other small sugary foods to help maintain focus until your diet improves.</p><p>physical condition also plays a role in attention. healthy physical condition is not so much about being in shape, though, as it is about having a working body. your body is <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14527637"">intended</a> to be used for things like running, jumping, bending, and lifting, so if you don&#x27;t get regular physical activity your body is not operating under normal conditions. this can lead to <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21417955"">decreased cognitive function</a> in general, and <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755296613000501"">difficulty focusing</a> in particular.</p><p>environmental and metabolic impacts on attention covered, there are the psychological aspects of focus. it&#x27;s easier to focus on things you care about, even when those things may not be the things you think you should care about. when you lack a reason to care, it&#x27;s harder to focus and get things done. if you don&#x27;t much care about something then you either need to start caring or accept you don&#x27;t actually care and not expect to be able to focus easily. either way is fine, but it underscores the point that caring matters. focusing on things you don&#x27;t care about is mentally taxing and burns out ability to focus.</p><p>but focus is not everything. even if you can focus your attention well on whatever you want whenever you want, you still have to decide what to focus on. and the first part of deciding what to focus on is remembering.</p><h1>refinding thoughts</h1><p>better wayfinding depends in-the-moment on <a href=""http://gworley3.github.io/wayfinding/finding-focus.html"">improving focus and attention</a>, but wayfinding is also about reading your map, i.e. remembering things. and remembering things is about rethinking old thoughts, i.e. recalling memories: thoughts you previously had that you can rethink quickly without having to regenerate them from scratch. to outperform <a href=""http://gworley3.github.io/wayfinding/natural-wayfinding.html"">natural wayfinding</a>, we&#x27;re going to need to investigate the limits of memory and find ways to work with those limits to achieve more.</p><p>memory is actually made up of at least three parts: sensory memory, working memory, and long-term memories. sensory memory is the very short lived (less than 1 second) memory that sense organs use in relaying information to the brain. working memory, also known as short-term memory, is the set of thoughts you can keep consciously aware of without repeated sensory information from outside your body. long-term memories are a collection of different mechanisms you use to store different types of information in different ways for long periods of time outside conscious thought to be recalled later. for example, it appears that long-term smell memory is separate from long-term fact memory, thus you have multiple long-term memories.</p><p>your working memory is very limited. most people can only keep about <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3721021/"">5 things</a> in their conscious thoughts at a time. it <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baddeley%27s_model_of_working_memory"">appears</a> that working memory is made up primarily of an auditory loop. this loop repeats sound information inside your head over and over, but it is of a fixed length, so you can&#x27;t remember anything more than what you can cram in there. although it appears that some people have <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23184506"">had success</a> training longer working-memory through exercises, even then the increases are relatively small (and probably <a href=""http://www.gwern.net/DNB%20meta-analysis"">not that useful</a>). so even if you can get yourself more working memory, it still means you can keep little more than a handful of things in your conscious thoughts.</p><p>in comparison you store an almost limitless number of thoughts in long term memory, but these memory faculties have their own constraints. semantic memory is how you remember independent facts like &#x27;tomatoes are red&#x27; and &#x27;the mendoza line is .200&#x27;. this is apart from procedural memories that store sensory information and emotional content triggered by other memories. excepting cases of dementia or brain injury, it appears semantic memories can stay around indefinitely once <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_consolidation"">consolidated</a>, but may become almost impossible to retrieve without regular recall to maintain consolidation. in this way semantic memory is like working memory in that you have to keep repeating thoughts to hold on to them, but the process operates over months and years instead of seconds.</p><p>episodic memory lets you remember past experiences and other generic information that isn&#x27;t otherwise stored in another long-term memory. unfortunately episodic memory is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confabulation"">highly unreliable</a>: very little detail is stored in episodic memory so most of the details have to be <a href=""http://scienceblogs.com/neurophilosophy/2008/06/13/anatomy-of-a-false-memory/"">reconstructed</a> on-the-fly when recalling a thought. this means environmental factors can heavily influence the details of episodic memories if not their gist. however episodic memories seem to be more robust than semantic memories, able to be recalled after many years of disuse, so they provide a potential key to very long-term storage of arbitrary information.</p><p>given this amazing yet limited memory, we now need to look for ways to improve upon it. techniques fall into roughly two categories: optimizations and augmentations. optimizations are those methods that make better use of your existing memory abilities to maximize their potential. augmentations are processes that put memory outside your head so you can reliably retrieve thoughts later. we&#x27;ll consider both in turn.</p><h1>refinding optimizations</h1><p>let&#x27;s first consider optimizations for <a href=""http://gworley3.github.io/wayfinding/refinding-thoughts.html"">refinding thoughts</a>. there are many well known mechanisms for improving memory, so i&#x27;m going to focus on three here that are relatively easy wins: simple to learn and high value. They are chunking, spaced repetition, and the method of loci.</p><p>the simplest is <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/09/using-pattern-recognition-to-enhance-memory-and-creativity/261925/"">chunking</a>, and it applies to both working and semantic memory. rather than remembering, for example, three letters as &#x27;b, r, and t&#x27;, you chunk them together into &#x27;brt&#x27;. when combining just a few things this chunk ends up as a single thought in your memory that you can recall all at once and then split apart when necessary. this is famously used in telephone numbers to make them easier to remember, but you can find examples of chunking everywhere, especially in how you remember tradenames and common phrases.</p><p>a naive model of how this works is that thoughts can each hold some maximum amount of information. you store thoughts in your memory rather than raw information, so chunking allows you to better pack information into thoughts and make more efficient use of the space. this is especially useful for working memory since you can only keep about 5 thoughts in your head at once.</p><p>but packing your thoughts tightly does no good if you can&#x27;t remember them. semantic memory relies on consolidation, yet you have little direct control over what gets consolidated. sometimes things you would like to remember fail to get consolidated while other things you perceive as less useful do. to ensure the thoughts you most care about get and stay consolidated, you can use the method of <a href=""http://www.gwern.net/Spaced%20repetition"">spaced repetition</a>.</p><p>the idea of spaced repetition is simple: on some regular schedule you review thoughts to give them repeated opportunities for consolidation. often people optimize and automate this process using technology as simple as flashcards or as complex as <a href=""http://ankisrs.net/"">anki</a>, but it works even without tooling. for example, when you meet new people most of the time you need to see them a few times spread out over days or weeks in order for them to become fixed in your mind. without reinforcement at regularly intervals you&#x27;re likely to forget them. the trick of spaced repetition is to take this natural method you have for filtering what information to remember and deliberately using it to choose what you will remember.</p><p>the most advanced technique i&#x27;ll mention, and the one that takes the most effort to get the most out of, has been used for thousands of years and is known as the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci"">method of loci</a> or <a href=""http://www.wikihow.com/Build-a-Memory-Palace"">the memory palace</a>. the idea is to use episodic memory to construct narratives where you imagine a place in your mind that you can explore and move through to find information. this is how people could recite epic poems like the homeric epics from memory. before the modern era of cheap writing reproduction, most educated people learned the method of loci so they could reliably store information that they would have no other way to lookup later.</p><p>as this suggests, the method of loci is less popular now because we instead use memory augmentation systems, but it is still useful to some people, especially those who may not have the luxury of accessing the world&#x27;s knowledge from a tiny device in their pocket or need faster recall than such devices allow. anyone who must react quickly and think on their feet without looking things up could stand to build a memory palace.</p><p>so now you have techniques to better use working, semantic, and episodic memory, and until a few hundred years ago this would have been the limit of what you could have done to improve your memory. but writing and the technologies dependent upon it allow us to do something more: we can augment our memories by storing thoughts outside our heads for later remembering by reinput.</p><h1>refinding augmentations</h1><p>beyond <a href=""http://gworley3.github.io/wayfinding/refinding-optimizations.html"">techniques to better utilize memory</a>, the skill of <a href=""http://gworley3.github.io/wayfinding/refinding-thoughts.html"">refinding thought</a> can be improved with memory argumentation systems. they are not so complex as the name implies, though: simply put these are ways of storing thoughts outside your head so you can easily access them later. the complexity in memory augmentation lies in the vast web of technologies needed to make these systems practical. that&#x27;s why even as recently as a few decades ago these sorts of systems were in less use than they are today, and will likely be in greater use in the future.</p><p>working memory is short, but the way it functions shows us how to improve upon it. working memory appears to be primarily an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baddeley%27s_model_of_working_memory"">auditory loop and visual sketchpad</a> of you repeating things to yourself. it&#x27;s an internal mechanism for resending information as if you were sensing it for the first time. we can take advantage of the same technique, but using your eyes and putting the &#x27;loop&#x27; outside your head.</p><p>you can augment your memory by making things visible (as in literally writing them down where you can see them). when you can quickly look around to see things you don&#x27;t have to put any effort into remembering them other than recalling where to look when you need something. this is a far easier task than trying to keep lots of information in your head, because if nothing else you can quickly rescan everything in your visual field to find what you want.</p><p>but for this to work the information has to be actually visible to you. this works well if, for example, you work on a computer and have a large enough screen that you can multiplex it to see many views at once: web pages, documents you&#x27;re editing, chat logs, whatever. or, if you&#x27;re working on paper or with a chalk board, writing all the stuff you need to recall where you can easily glance over to see it. all these work by taking the burden of remembering something in working memory and offloading it to a system so you don&#x27;t have to keep it in your head, freeing up your working memory to have more space to work with new concepts as you think them up but haven&#x27;t written them down.</p><p>if we take this same technique but make it about storing information rather than looking at it right away, you get the great collection of memory augmentation systems we know as notes, diaries, papers, web pages, and books. we take these technologies for granted today, but they have radically changed how much information a single person can use over the course of their life. five hundred years ago the story was very different.</p><p>until the invention of the printing press people had to personally write down all information they wanted to store. at best a person could hire scribes to help them, but this was still a very expensive proposition. by using movable-type printing presses people could write things for you, and all you had to do was buy a copy. this began a trend of accelerating growth in knowledge stores that today gives you orders of magnitude more information than you could ever use in a lifetime.</p><p>so now that we&#x27;ve covered memory and <a href=""http://gworley3.github.io/wayfinding/finding-focus.html"">focus</a>, there remains one last part to your <a href=""http://gworley3.github.io/wayfinding/natural-wayfinding.html"">natural wayfinding</a> abilities to be improved: prioritization. this is the last piece of the puzzle of how you can better <a href=""http://gworley3.github.io/wayfinding/finding-your-way.html"">find your way</a>.</p><h1>finding priority</h1><p>when we began our investigation of <a href=""http://gworley3.github.io/wayfinding/natural-wayfinding.html"">natural wayfinding</a> we broke it down into three parts: <a href=""http://gworley3.github.io/wayfinding/finding-focus.html"">focus</a>, <a href=""http://gworley3.github.io/wayfinding/refinding-thoughts.html"">memory</a>, and prioritization. the former two make up the prerequisite skills of wayfinding, but they only take you as far as <a href=""http://localhost:4000/mapmaking/map-making.html"">map</a> reading. the last, the ability to prioritize, is what is needed to <a href=""http://gworley3.github.io/wayfinding/finding-your-way.html"">find your way</a>.</p><p>luckily you are already pretty good at prioritizing! you prioritize all the time without even realizing it. that&#x27;s because this is the faculty by which you do things: you must always choose what things to do because you cannot do everything at once. do you breathe now? eat? drink? dance? read? the choices you make are the result of a complex process of prioritizing all possible actions.</p><p>to appreciate just how hard it is to choose, consider the problem of building an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence"">artificial intelligence</a>. early on computer scientists thought it would be easy: just put a bunch of info in the computer, set up some simple, self-improving algorithms to work with it, and you&#x27;ll get an ai. but it <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter"">turns out that doesn&#x27;t work</a>: we today have computers with far more focus and memory than any human could ever have, but we still don&#x27;t consider them to have intelligence on par with insects let alone humans. why aren&#x27;t computers already intelligent? because their prioritization mechanisms are too simple.</p><p>what humans and most animals can do that computers cannot do yet is rapidly make nuanced decisions among infinitely many possible choices that steer the world towards a particular state. computers instead rely on humans to narrow down their choices enough that they can decide among a finite set of possible actions (this is, in essence, what an algorithm and, by extension, a computer program is). we take prioritization for granted, but trying to understand it well enough to build it has made it very clear that it&#x27;s amazingly difficult and requires tremendous complexity.</p><p>so choosing is hard, but luckily we are like magic prioritization <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box"">black boxes</a> that somehow know how to do it without really understanding how we do it. we regularly pick from among unlimited possible actions, mostly without any awareness of how it happens. yet there is a small part of the prioritization process we notice because we have access to it, and that part is conscious choice. but conscious choice is expensive and limited. in fact, it&#x27;s limited by the same <a href=""http://gworley3.github.io/wayfinding/refinding-optimizations.html"">5 thought limit we have on our memory</a>.</p><p>because it&#x27;s hard to think more than 5 thoughts at the same time, it&#x27;s hard to consciously prioritize among more than 5 potential actions at once. there&#x27;s not much we can do to optimize prioritization beyond improving focus and memory, but we can augment our ability to choose similar to how we <a href=""http://gworley3.github.io/wayfinding/refinding-augmentations.html"">augment memory</a>. so if you need to consciously prioritize among more than 5 things, and you are sure you can&#x27;t simplify your life so you don&#x27;t have to choose among more than 5 things, then you need a prioritization system.</p><p>all good prioritization systems are built around:</p><ul><li>creation: putting stuff you need to get done in a simple, reliable, highly available system</li><li>curation: keeping the system clean and current so you can trust it completely (if you don&#x27;t trust it then it won&#x27;t work because you&#x27;ll defend your sanity by continuing to try to prioritize solely in your head)</li><li>choice: looking at that system when you need to choose what to do because it is not immediately obvious or because you are confused</li></ul><p>the most popular modern manifestation of a system with these three-cs is <a href=""http://gettingthingsdone.com/"">getting things done</a>. it&#x27;s a great choice to get started, and gtd learning materials will teach you how to work a prioritization system. but gtd is only one way: once you master the basics you will likely go on to build your own system that fits your life and the tools available to you.</p><p>but i have to end on a warning. prioritization systems can be intoxicating to some people who would give themselves up to the system so they don&#x27;t have to choose. it doesn&#x27;t work like that! you are the engine the drives the prioritization system: the system has no power to drive you. if you abdicate decisions to the system no decisions will be made and the system will just drain your time. you are the agent, and the prioritization system is a tool to help you, not the other way around.</p>",,gworley,gordon-seidoh-worley,Gordon Seidoh Worley
sAhd58mMuqEE89D3P,[Old] Mapmaking Series,old-mapmaking-series,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/sAhd58mMuqEE89D3P/old-mapmaking-series,2019-03-12T17:32:04.609Z,8,2,0,False,False,,"<p>A few years ago I had a <a href=""http://gworley3.github.io/"">different blog</a> than my <a href=""https://mapandterritory.org/"">current one</a> and I wrote two series of posts there. I no longer think they are especially good, but thanks to my recent linking of the second series in comments on a discussion here on LW, I have gotten feedback that they were useful to a couple people. So in the spirit of making this content a little more accessible, easily findable, and linkable, I'm reposting them here with minimal editing. I'm grouping them together in two posts to cover the two series of posts I made.</p><p>This first series is about LW rationality basics largely covered in the sequences, but I wanted to express those ideas in my own words. It was mostly useful for me to do that work of putting my understanding into words, and I'm not sure how much reading the series in this post is worthwhile to others, but the second series references it, so seems worth having it here for ease of access. The second series is probably more valuable, and I'll link it here once it's up. <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/SacT5EB48A7rX5wnf/old-wayfinding-series"">ETA: It's up.</a></p><hr class=""dividerBlock""><h1>map and territory</h1><p>let's start at the beginning. both my beginnings with rationality and the first place you should start to find the winning way.</p><p>by now the metaphor seems well worn to me, but i have to remember that there was a time when i didn't know about it. a time when i could get confused about the correspondence between my own thoughts and reality. and even a time when i had the words to separate the two but could still get things confused. so let me try to ease you in to our first attempt to break and reintegrate your thinking: the metaphor of the map and the territory.</p><blockquote>a wise king commands a map of perfect detail be made of his kingdom. the map makers begin the project. animals in their own and neighboring kingdoms are slaughtered to make the parchment. forests are cleared to collect all their resin and giant holes are left in the ground from extracting graphite to make the ink. the army of map makers works furiously day and night until at last they tell the king the project is finished. in the morning, they say, the map shall be revealed to him.<br>when the king wakes up he notices it's unusually dark. looking out the royal window, he sees that the sky has turned a yellowish tan and the light is blocked out. he stares at the sky, examining the lines that seem to have replaced the sun and clouds. slowly realization dawns on him: the sky has been replaced by a map!<br>the king runs downstairs, still in his nightgown, calling for his map makers. the king throws open the doors of the throne room to find them gathered, nodding and smiling to themselves.<br>""what is the meaning of this?!?"" he bellows.<br>""why, sire,"" the head map maker says, ""we have completed the project as requested. you need now only look up to see a perfectly accurate map of the kingdom in the sky.""</blockquote><p>it's easy, in hindsight, to see the king's confusion. in asking for a perfectly accurate map, he got the only thing that could be perfectly accurate: an exact reflection of the kingdom. in fact, in this story, i'm disappointed the map makers didn't manage to achieve greater accuracy by not constructing a map at all and just declaring the kingdom to be the map of itself. to literally make the map the territory.</p><p>when we talk of maps what we really want are smaller versions of reality that we can carry in our pockets. or, less metaphorically speaking, thoughts we can use to model the world.</p><p>this is one of the things folks mean when they say that the map is not the territory: the map serves a different purpose than the territory, and it would be impractical to use the territory as a map. or, to again the break down the metaphor, models are useful because they are thoughts we use to reason about the state of the world. there can be no such thing as a perfect model: all models contain error and uncertainty. you cannot be 100% or 0% sure of something. <a href=""http://www.yudkowsky.net/rational/bayes"">probability is subjective</a>; <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/iv2/an_introduction_to_rationality/"">beliefs contain uncertainty</a>.</p><h1>maps are simple</h1><p>inherent in the <a href=""http://gworley3.github.io/mapmaking/map-and-territory.html"">map and territory</a> analogy is a certain conception of what 'truth' means. it relies on what some might call <a href=""http://www.yudkowsky.net/rational/the-simple-truth/"">the simple truth</a> or the naive perspective on reality. its points are this:</p><ul><li>the world exists and is universal (the same for everyone)</li><li>everyone perceives the world for themselves (we each make our own map)</li><li>the quality of the map is a measure of how well it shows (predicts) the locations (states) of the world</li></ul><p>another way to say this is: the truth is out there, and it's your job to map it.</p><p>this is worth pointing out because for the last century there's been a trend in western thinking to conflate the map with the territory. it pops up in theories like ""truth is relative"" and ""reality is made by consensus"". sure enough, since maps exist they are part of the territory, but this does not mean the map is the territory. maps can be built collaboratively, and we all have our own maps, but this doesn't make truth collaborative or relative: it makes map making a shared task and maps subjective.</p><p>the following short story may help make this clearer. my goal is to cause, if it has not already happened for you, a shift in the way you understand your relationship with reality. it happened for me when i read <a href=""https://intelligence.org/files/CFAI.pdf#subsection.3.1"">cfai section 3.1</a>. i hope it will or already has happened for you, because fully understanding the relationship between the map and the territory is essential to making progress in the winning way.</p><blockquote>For generations, the Shepherd had been tasked with keeping track of the village’s flock. Every day he let the sheep out to graze and then recalled them all at night to the safety of the fence. The duty passed from father to son, requiring years of training to be able to remember all the sheep and notice if one went missing.</blockquote><blockquote>The last Shepherd, known to his friends as Artzain, was especially skilled. He could recognize all his sheep and knew when one was missing. He never failed to notice a missing sheep, even if he couldn’t always find the missing ones before night fell and the wolves preyed on them.</blockquote><blockquote>Artzain’s son, Umalusi, seemed destined to lose much of the flock. Although Artzain spent many hours every day teaching Umalusi how to recognize the sheep, to tell them apart by subtle differences, and notice if one was missing, Umalusi could no better tell apart the sheep than any other villager.</blockquote><blockquote>Disheartened, Artzain stopped actively teaching Umalusi. He committed himself to the idea that he would have to live long enough to train his grandson, lest Umalusi lose all the sheep and the village starve.</blockquote><blockquote>Left to himself, Umalusi spent his time playing games and making up new, ever more creative games to occupy his time. This seemed not very useful, but since the only job available to Umalusi was Shepherd, and Artzain had no intention of letting him mind the flock, everyone left him alone with his games.</blockquote><blockquote>As Umalusi entered his 16th year, his father fell suddenly ill. Artzain was unable to stand, and so could not mind the flock. He had no choice but to send out Umalusi to act as Shepherd.</blockquote><blockquote>When he came home on the first night, Artzain asked Umalusi if he had lost any sheep.</blockquote><blockquote>“No, father. They all returned to the fence,” said Umalusi.</blockquote><blockquote>Artzain sighed. To the untrained eye it probably did look like they had all returned, but in his heart he knew that his son had probably lost a few sheep to the wolves.</blockquote><blockquote>The next day he was still too weak, so Artzain sent Umalusi in his place again. And again, Umalusi came home and reported having lost no sheep, and again Artzain didn’t really believe him.</blockquote><blockquote>After three more days of Umalusi watching the sheep and claiming that none had been lost, Artzain regained his strength and was able to shepherd again. On his first morning back with his flock, he was astonished to find that all of the sheep were there. He hollered for Umalusi, who came running thinking something terrible had happened to his father.</blockquote><blockquote>“What’s wrong?” said Umalusi.</blockquote><blockquote>“No sheep are missing,” said Artzain. “How?”</blockquote><blockquote>“Stones.”</blockquote><blockquote>“What do you mean ‘stones’?”“You have already let the sheep out for today, so I can’t show you, but let me mind the sheep tomorrow and I’ll show you.”</blockquote><blockquote>The next morning, Artzain and Umalusi went to the sheep enclosure together as they had not done since Umalusi was a child. Artzain extended his arm to tell Umalusi to proceed, and Umalusi walked over to the gate.</blockquote><blockquote>There, he set down two large clay pots. One was filled with river pebbles, and the other was empty. He opened the gate just wide enough that one sheep could make it through at a time. As the sheep moved out of the paddock and into the pasture, he began moving stones from one clay pot to the other.</blockquote><blockquote>“What are you doing, my boy,” said Artzain.</blockquote><blockquote>“Counting sheep,” said Umalusi.</blockquote><blockquote>“What is counting?”</blockquote><blockquote>“It’s a game I made up for tracking things. See, when a sheep leaves the paddock, I move a stone from the left pot into the right.”</blockquote><blockquote>Umalusi paused to move some stones from the left pot to the right because some sheep had gone out of the paddock while he was talking.</blockquote><blockquote>“I know you like games, son, but what has that got to do with sheep?” asked Artzain.</blockquote><blockquote>“Imagine that each sheep is a stone. The left pot is the paddock and the right pot is the pasture. I use the stones to know where the sheep are,” said Umalusi.</blockquote><blockquote>“Ah, I see,” said Artzain, “you have secretly been studying magic from Shaman while I have been out with the sheep all day. You have learned some spell to control the sheep with the stones.”</blockquote><blockquote>“Not at all,” said Umalusi, plopping a few more stones from the left pot to the right. “I know nothing of magic.”</blockquote><blockquote>“Then how can you be controlling the sheep with the stones?”</blockquote><blockquote>“I’m not. I move the stones when the sheep move.”</blockquote><blockquote>Artzain chuckled heartily. “I see. So you expect me to believe, then, that the sheep have put a spell on you, and that they are making you move the stones rather than the other way around!”</blockquote><blockquote>“In a way, that’s true,” said Umalusi. “But the sheep have no magical power over me. I move the stones to match where the sheep are. I only win if there is one stone for each sheep in the correct pot”</blockquote><blockquote>“Fine, but how do you know which stone belongs to which sheep? Now you have to be able to tell apart all the sheep and all the stones.”</blockquote><blockquote>“Nope. To me, all the sheep look the same. All the stones look the same, too. So it doesn’t matter to me which sheep or which stone I move, so long as there are as many stones as there are sheep.”</blockquote><blockquote>“But no two sheep are the same,” said Artzain.</blockquote><blockquote>“And no two stones are the same,” said Umalusi.“</blockquote><blockquote>So how can you possibly say it doesn’t matter so long as you have the right number of stones in the right pots?”</blockquote><blockquote>“Because although all sheep are different and all stones are different, I can treat them all the same in my game. So to me one sheep in the paddock is the same as any other sheep in the paddock, so one stone in the left pot is the same as any other stone in the left pot.”</blockquote><blockquote>Artzain stood silent and thought for a few minutes. Finally he said, “I think I understand, but to me it seems strange to ignore details in order to be able to do something you couldn’t do with them. Yet I can’t deny the fact that you’ve managed not to lose any sheep, even though you can’t tell them apart, by doing this.”</blockquote><blockquote>“I admit, I also found it a bit odd at first, and if I’m honest I’ve been secretly testing this method out from a distance while you watched the flock. When you got sick, it was my first chance to try it for real.”</blockquote><blockquote>“Well, I’m glad you succeeded. Now I can retire. You are now Shepard.”</blockquote><blockquote>“Thanks, but I’m not sure I want to stay Shepard. I have bigger games to play.”</blockquote><h1>maps make meaning</h1><p>when i talk about the map and the territory, i talk almost exclusively about the map, and when i do mention the territory it's as some undifferentiated soup that exists 'out there'. turns about, that's because we literally cannot talk about anything other than maps.</p><p>there is a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Treachery_of_Images"">famous painting of a pipe</a> with the caption ""this is not a pipe"". on the surface this may seem odd: you are most definitely looking at a pipe. but really the thing you see is not a pipe, but rather a representation of one. that is to say, a map.</p><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach"">let that sink in a bit</a>. we say 'the map is not the territory', but here we are being quite explicit about it. the map of a thing is not the thing itself.</p><p>once you understand this, you are led to the inevitable conclusion that you have never directly known reality in your life.</p><p>since pipes are relatively rare now, consider the humble spoon. you may object that you've seen spoons in real life, held them in your hand, maybe even used them to eat. surely that was the territory. but consider, how did you even know that thing was a spoon, or even a thing separate from other things? how could you tell that some small part of the universe was distinct from the rest of it in a way that you might call that part of it a spoon? because you have a map that allows you to literally make sense of <em>things</em>: to tell stuff in the universe apart.</p><p>to put it another way, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAXtO5dMqEI"">there is no spoon</a> until you create it. as far as the universe is concerned (and it's not concerned with anything at all in such a fundamental way you can't even really say the universe is or is not concerned), spoons do not exist. the territory is just stuff that has particular properties. although the stuff you will soon call a spoon exists independent of your understanding of it, it does not really become a spoon until it is mapped into one. the map makes the meaning, and it is only in the map that the spoon appears out of reality's confounded state.</p><p>in fact, there is no territory without the map, because the separation of map and territory is itself part of the map. without the map, there would be nothing to call territory in contrast to it: it would simply be everything, with all its complexities and yet none of its differentiation. it is the map that makes the meaning because the territory is confused. not in the usual sense of 'confused', but in the literal sense based on it's etymology: all mixed together as to be indistinguishable. the territory is confused, and you will be confused without the map to help you make meaning of it.</p><h1>maps are wrong</h1><p>if you have ever used a geographical map to help you navigate roads or the wilds or the ocean, you have inevitably encountered disagreement between the map and the territory you are in: the road you are looking for isn't there, a boulder is blocking your way, or the water is much shallower than reported. in these ways maps can be wrong, and yet we wouldn't say the map is all wrong: if nothing else it was right enough that you made it as far as finding the map's errors. when we say 'the map is wrong' what we really mean is 'it has errors'. unsurprisingly, this is also true of our metaphorical maps of the territory of reality.</p><p>because the <a href=""http://gworley3.github.io/mapmaking/map-and-territory.html"">map is not the territory</a>, it must contain errors. this is supported by our knowledge of <a href=""https://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/thermodynamics/v/thermodynamics-part-1"">thermodynamics</a> and its mathematical abstraction, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory"">information theory</a>, with assistance from <a href=""http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/SpecialRelativity.html"">special relativity</a> to prevent anything happening instantaneously. and don't try any <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement"">quantum trickery</a>: at <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-cloning_theorem"">most</a> it just shows we can <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_teleportation"">move bits around before creating them</a>. so if we cannot have an error-free map, we should consider how to live with those errors.</p><p>although i like to talk about maps, in everyday language people talk about beliefs, i.e. thoughts about the state of the world. and the naive model of belief common in the occident is that beliefs are either true (perfectly predict reality) or false. this leads some <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_skepticism"">folks</a> to talk of rejecting all beliefs, especially because 'belief' is often a word associated with religion. while this position is understandable given a true or false model of belief, from a technical standpoint, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief"">belief</a> is the right term, so what we need is a better theory of belief.</p><p>that is to say, we need a more useful map of the map.</p><p>the best model i know of is to treat beliefs as <a href=""http://www.yudkowsky.net/rational/bayes"">subjective and probabilistic</a>. if you think of a belief as a point on the map, each belief is made up of at least two parts: a statement about reality and a likelihood of correctness. this expands the notion of correctness assumed by the naive model of belief by adding a mechanism for assessing the maybe-ness of a belief. with this richer model of belief, we can understand the map as something that may be mostly right, but not in the sense of mostly made up of true things, but in the sense of mostly made up of things that are mostly likely to be true. the burden of truth shifts from the map to the territory, where it belongs, and leaves the map with the responsibility of assessing its likelihood of reflecting reality.</p><h1>map making</h1><p><a href=""http://gworley3.github.io/mapmaking/maps-are-wrong.html"">all maps contain errors</a>, but since error cannot be eliminated, the next best thing is to reduce the magnitude of our errors, and in so doing, perhaps also the count. now that we know <a href=""http://gworley3.github.io/mapmaking/maps-are-simple.html"">what the map is</a> and <a href=""http://gworley3.github.io/mapmaking/maps-make-meaning.html"">what it is for</a>, we are ready to consider the process of map making.</p><p>the key techniques for improving your map making skills over your natural abilities are well known and studied, but they are also scattered and difficult to implement. the map making skills of your ancestors beget your natural mapping skills, but they only had to be good enough map makers to produce you. that still makes them excellent map makers, ergo also you, but it does not imply you have reached the limits of your map making abilities. sure, you can already make maps that are good enough, but our goal is not a good enough map, but the best map we can make!</p><p>since the skills of better map making are already <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Popper"">well explored</a> by <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell"">others</a>, let's just take a tour (with links) of what you should know so that you can start your journey to better map making.</p><p>the first thing is to have a good map of the map. this cannot be underestimated, because your map of the map constrains your thoughts about the map, and if you want to make better maps, you need a strong process for reasoning about the map that allows you to improve upon it. without a good model of the map many map making techniques, commonly referred to as critical thinking and rationality, will seem confusing. this doesn't mean you can't start learning techniques before you have your model of the map figured out: it just means you will face confusion and difficulty as you figure out how to reason about the map in a way that makes some of the most powerful techniques useful. that's why i like to write more about the map and less about map making.</p><p>so assuming you have a good enough map of the map, let's highlight the core knowledge and techniques humans have accumulated to help them make better maps.</p><ul><li><a href=""https://books.google.com/books?id=7papZR4oVssC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;lpg=PA20#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"">reasoning</a> <a

<p>Previously in pizza: <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/03/17/restaurant-guide-2-pizza/"">Restaurant Guide 2: Pizza</a></p>
<p>If you don’t live in and aren’t visiting New York, and want to know how to find good pizza, refer to the guide above. It tells you what you need to know.</p>
<p>This series is about the particular places I love. I want to help people find them, so they can enjoy, and can help the places stay in business. It does not mean these are the best pizza places in the city. Again, <em>some </em>of these are <em>some </em>of the best places. They are the ones that have the most value <em>to me, </em>based on where I live and my taste in a pie.</p>
<p>I mostly order plain (red) pizza, either regular, Sicilian or where available Grandma Sicilian. Most toppings, in my view, detract rather than add value. I’ll take fresh garlic when available, and can be easily talked into ricotta. Where I can get prosciutto, I’ll often take that, but definitely not other meats. I can’t speak to topping quality, in most cases.</p>
<p>Remember, <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2019/02/10/minimize-use-of-standard-internet-food-delivery/"">if you order in New York, use Slice</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><a href=""https://goo.gl/maps/e7gQtGYVjFq"">1. Joe &amp; Pat’s</a></h3>
<p>I have never been to the original on Staten Island, but since this opened on 10th Street and 1st Avenue last year, it instantly became my clear go-to place for a pie. They aren’t cheap, but they’re worth it.</p>
<p><img src=""https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/3cXSJ6TkyFbaBm5sGTDZzA/ls.jpg"" /></p>
<p>Their regular pie is quite good. a light blend:</p>
<p><img src=""https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/2Dh74IqSTcmFGyfpGr3sKQ/o.jpg"" /></p>
<p>Their vodka pie is also quite good. The real treasure is the Grandma Sicilian. Pictured with half pepperoni, because my friend wanted that yesterday.</p>
<p><img src=""https://thezvi.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/joe-and-pats.jpg?w=385&amp;h=514"" /></p>
<p>That’s what you should usually order. It’s a huge amount of piping hot, super flavorful and perfectly balanced pizza that does everything I am looking for in this style of pizza.</p>
<p>I’ve also tried their pasta. The lasagna was quite good, the pesto less so, as one would expect.</p>
<p>It’s a kid-friendly and nice place to sit down and have an amazing pizza as a family, which isn’t something the area was missing before, and it blows everything else locally out of the water on quality except maybe Motorino, which we’ll get to in a bit.</p>
<h3>2. <a href=""https://goo.gl/maps/Ti8KYaQSWG32"">Muzzarella Pizza</a></h3>
<p><img src=""https://i.pinimg.com/236x/a4/f0/d5/a4f0d5e16ae41ed24ce5291decf90cda--buffalo-chicken-the-white.jpg"" /></p>
<p>Good, fast, cheap. Usually one picks at most two. At Muzzarella on 14th Street and Avenue A, you get all three. The place doesn’t look like much. Until a few months ago it didn’t take credit cards. The ingredients aren’t quite top level the way they are at most other places on this list, but they know exactly how to mix and prepare them to give that classic sauce-cheese goodness mix that one craves, and the crust is solid and complements what they’re doing.</p>
<p>This isn’t one of the best places out there. But for $14, you can get a damn fine pie, get it fast, and get it two blocks from my apartment (or get it delivered there, still very hot). Everyone needs a good delivery pizza place, so for that reason alone it makes the number two slot.</p>
<p>As of this writing I don’t have a photo, so I’ll be updating when I next order, if I remember to do so.</p>
<h3><a href=""https://goo.gl/maps/2kqmQArpo8C2"">3. Keste Pizza &amp; Vino</a></h3>

<p>They only rank third due to their location relative to mine, out in the West Village, and I haven’t been exhaustive in my searches outside of Manhattan, but I have this as the best pizza place. This is the perfect Italian pie. Balance is exactly right, the ingredients all soar, it’s cheap, it’s fast, it’s peaceful and welcoming. Everything I want.</p>
<p>The pizzas are a little small. If it was close by, that might be a plus for me. Given how far it is, I get highly tempted to get two, which also grants variety, but is definitely a little more pizza than I should be eating.</p>
<h3><a href=""https://goo.gl/maps/J7iMQdT1ksx"">4. Grimaldi’s</a></h3>
<p><img src=""https://d3ciwvs59ifrt8.cloudfront.net/3d2faca2-b31b-426a-8e30-d282d46d987b/5f9b3caf-2ef9-4c26-acc2-be823a0a1b8e.jpg"" /></p>
<p><img src=""https://media.timeout.com/images/100131923/630/472/image.jpg"" /></p>
<p>It’s not quite as good as the original Juliana’s, but it’s close, and Juliana’s is in Brooklyn while Grimaldi’s is at the center of Chelsea. The style is a cross between New York and Italian, also similar to Joe and Pat’s base pie. Note that the style does not travel at all, and must be consumed immediately. No time to waste. If your group orders multiple pizzas, try to space them out if you can! This is the only quality place I’ve been to that actively gives less cheese than I prefer, so I like to add ricotta here.</p>

<p>This is the original, the ultimate pizza of its class. Whenever I have a reason to be in the right part of Brooklyn, I’ll do my best to make it here. That still isn’t too often, though.</p>

<p>Motorino is up to four locations. It’s no Keste, but it’s only a few steps behind. The one near me is at 12th Street and 1st Avenue. I find them slightly overrated, but that is taking into account a very high rating where they pop up near the top of best-of lists. Their crust is quite strong. The lunch special gives you a quick pie-for-one for $15, and technically comes with a salad. Salads are not, shall we say, relevant to my interests. Get one of the pies that offers bufala mozzerella, as the difference is large. They are a cut above Luzzo’s and other similar places in the area.</p>
<h3><a href=""https://goo.gl/maps/reeXAVthWAk"">6. Dan Antonio</a></h3>
<p>Dan Antonio is a unique style of pizza in what is otherwise a bit of a food desert aside from Plataforma, on the extreme west side on 50th Street. You want their Montanara pizza, which is their specialty, with a thick crust. When I was there they also offered dough balls as an appetizer for almost no money, a great deal if you’re hungry now and/or want to supplement your pizza a little, but I don’t see it on the online menu anymore. A shame.</p>

<h3><a href=""https://goo.gl/maps/av3L3s3uN9v"">7. Joe’s Pizza</a></h3>

<p><img src=""https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0e/a0/7e/75/velka-syrova-cena-20dolaru.jpg"" /></p>
<p>It is a strange thing to list ten places and call two of them overrated, but I’m going to do that. Joe’s is dear to me because it has a great location for me, and when it’s on it serves up a most flavorful pair of slices at the counter. But every time I’ve ordered delivery, and sometimes when I go there, I’ve been disappointed, and I’ve given up on ordering whole pies here. Something’s about the flavor’s been off. Like Sal’s below, it also does not reheat well (and the style is similar, which is a hint), so make sure not to let them reheat your slices for you.</p>
<p>But it’s still a fine local place in my area that serves a purpose in my periodic pizza mix. When it delivers, it delivers the perfect neighborhood slice experience. Look at that pizza above, with that amazing texture. Often you can get exactly that, especially at peak times. Given what I’m up to, that merits mention.</p>
<h3><a href=""https://goo.gl/maps/kXBt5M9shMG2"">8. Rubirosa</a></h3>

<p><img src=""https://idktonight.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Rubirosa.jpg"" /></p>
<p>Downtown offers several places in this style. From what I’ve seen, Rubirosa is the best of the bunch. The pizza looks like it shouldn’t work, and it often feels like it is under-performing its ingredients. The ingredients are fantastic, though, so it’s still quite good. Last time I went we got a white pie, and the heaping mounds of ricotta were exactly what I was hoping to get, as much as I always miss the sauce when I go in that direction. Their vodka and regular pizzas are solid, but the white is my favorite here so far.</p>
<h3><a href=""https://goo.gl/maps/ER7i584j6hq"">9. Sal and Carmine Pizza</a></h3>

<p><img src=""https://i0.wp.com/images.nymag.com/listings/restaurant/mainsalandcarminepizza.jpg"" /></p>
<p>When I was growing up, this was our pizza place. Sal was always the friendly guy behind the counter. That’s him in the picture. Hi! Last time I dropped by he was still there. The pizza is classic New York style. When you got it fresh, it was excellent. But there was something about that particular pie that made it reheat especially poorly. I don’t know what it is, but I learned I actively didn’t want it once it went back into the oven. Many days I’d walk by, spy the pizza, and buy if and only if it looked hot. I’d ask for the pizza as-is. Warm wasn’t bad – it was specifically the reheating, perhaps the way he did it, that made it into something alien and wrong.</p>
<p>Nowadays of course I would just order a whole pizza. No reason to take any chances.</p>
<h3><a href=""https://goo.gl/maps/JzUiGSsc3PG2"">10. Cafe Viva</a></h3>

<p><img src=""https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/5XZkGBn1dGiE7ODALS1nAw/ls.jpg"" /></p>
<p>Cafe Viva does not look like much. If you order a regular slice, you’ll get something serviceable. Under normal circumstances, I would not have given the place much thought.</p>
<p>However, they were kosher, and four blocks from my parents’ place where I was living at the time. I was not allowed to bring non-kosher food into the house, even pizza. That meant this was the best I could do, and I started experimenting.</p>
<p>I finally figured out the correct order: Sicilian pizza, <em>well done. </em>This resulted in a marbling of the cheese and a crispy crust that delivered a <em>much </em>better pizza than any of the alternatives. Without the lack of alternatives, I never would have figured it out. I almost certainly have underutilized this technique in other places – I may never have asked for a ‘well done’ pie anywhere else, when I think about it.</p>
<h3>Others roundup</h3>
<p>This summer I intend to go on the Brooklyn pizza odyssey, and find out whether the top reputations there are earned or otherwise. And there are plenty of places in Manhattan I haven’t been able to try yet – next up is likely Prince Street Pizza. Meanwhile, there are lots of other good places in Manhattan worth sharing.</p>
<p>Back home on the Upper West Side at 110th and Broadway there’s Koronet Pizza and its monster slices. I do mean monster. A slice of Koronet is larger than an entire Keste personal pie. When I first got to the area I made the mistake of ordering two slices. Don’t do that. One is enough for anyone. An entire pizza can feed at least eight people. Probably more.</p>
<p>A block over on Amesterdam we had V&amp;T. V&amp;T was a nice, cheap Italian place for back when I didn’t know what top quality Italian food was. Everything was cheap, the style was unique for the time, and it all played in a nice classic red sauce atmosphere. I was on a budget, and came often. The place is still there, still doing its thing. I now know one can do better, but you can also do much worse. Stick to the pizza.</p>
<p>Down at 106th and Amsterdam is Mama’s Pizza. Classic New York slice place, full of the common people. Nothing that would blow you away, but it was pizza done right, with enough volume to keep the hot pies flowing. Always a solid choice.</p>
<p>Our area’s most recent edition is Lunetta Pizza. It’s a traditional New York slice shop, and the margarita pizza in particular looked promising so we ordered delivery. Alas, they couldn’t find our apartment in reasonable time and it was a chilly day, so the pizza wasn’t hot. Despite that, I could tell the pizza itself was legitimate, so at some point they’re going to get another chance. Maybe I’ll go in, maybe I’ll give them another shot to find us. Navigating to our exact location can be a bit tricky.</p>
<p>There’s also Numero 28. They’re cash only, and they are clearly doing a thing with a distinct style, that’s quite good. It’s not quite up to the top level, but variety is great, so I’ve been meaning to go back there some time soon.</p>
<p>We’re also within a few blocks of an Artichoke Pizza. Artichoke Pizza offers supremely thick crust pizzas with intense flavors. Before they moved across the street, I ate there several times, and also ordered delivery several times. Don’t order delivery. They don’t understand it, and it will take forever and likely be cold. You gotta go in. It plays out that this is almost never the experience I’m looking for, especially taking into account the extra calories it likely requires, so I end up basically never going. Still, it is a quality product and should be tried. If it closed I would be sad.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago I finally tried Lombardi’s, America’s first pizzeria. They’ve got a solid pie going on there. I was happy to have had the experience. But it’s not quite as good as the best competition.</p>
<p>Down in the financial district where I used to work and my friend Gaudenis still lives, there was a strange difficulty in finding a strong New York-style place, so instead I ended up on three pizza-bar style places. First I discovered Harry’s Italian, and then the slightly superior Adrienne’s Pizza Bar and Inatteso Pizza Bar. All present a rectangular, two slices by five to six slices, thin crust, with a distinctive sauce-cheese mix that is common to all three. Definitely not bad.</p>
<p>Again, the goal here is not to claim these are the best places. Many of them are, but that’s not the goal. The goal is to share that which has brought me joy, and which might bring you joy while helping my joy be sustainable. Check ’em out.</p>
<h3>Making One’s Own</h3>
<p>If there is a good pizza place around and you are not poor, unless you enjoy the process, you shouldn’t worry much about making your own. Pizza is one of the more efficient foods to buy versus cook. My friend Geoff has given us delicious homemade pizzas that were pretty great. I’m happy because I’m confident he enjoyed doing so. The hourly on that operation can’t have been good.</p>
<p>Ben Harrison and his rationalist group did science and are now doing a write-up on creating cheap and efficient homemade pizza. When they finish I’ll link here to their explanation.</p>
<p>My experience making my own pizza was mostly positive. I started out in Denver using <a href=""https://www.papamurphys.com/"">Papa Murphy’s</a>, as it was difficult to find a quality pizza place, and I appreciated the savings and the ability to have hot and fresh pies whenever I wanted. They put too much cheese on the pizzas, but that is easily fixed. It’s not <em>good </em>pizza, but cheap, convenient, hot and fresh goes a long way. I started experimenting with rolling my own from scratch.</p>
<p>When I briefly lived in a suburb of Boston, the pickings got far slimmer. There was no good local place of any kind, so I regularly made my own from scratch. If you want to make your own pizza, it’s best to roll your own dough and let it rise. Making your own sauce would be great too, but that was the level above mine. Many cans are decent. Experiment to find one you like, or spend the time and make your own.</p>
<p>Also important is a real pizza stone. If you’re going to do this a lot, invest in one.</p>
<p>When making your own, you can get the proportions and details that you like best, which is great, and you get the joy of cooking and learning. It’s nice. You don’t have to care how it looks or whether others would like it. I used <em>massive </em>sauce quantities versus standard ratios, and was happy to do so.</p>
<p>It’s also a lot of work, so I’m not that tempted to go back to it while I live in New York. But I do think back on it fondly.</p>

They're equivalent to the picture above, with a transparent bag where I can count the exact amount of marbles in each bag.  If I'm also certain about how much each marble is worth, then I have a simple strategy for dealing with risks in this situation.</p><h2>How to Mitigate Transparent Risks: Do the Math</h2><p>The simple strategy for transparent risks like the one above is to do the math.  </p><p><strong>Expected Value</strong></p><p>Expected value is a simple bit of probability theory that says you should multiply the likelihood of an event happening by the payoff to get your long run value over time.

I don't fully understand it, but you should, and <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/BZ6XaCwN4QGgH9CxF/the-kelly-criterion"">Zvi wrote a post in it here</a>. (If someone would be willing to walk me through a few examples and show me where all the numbers in the equation come from, I'd be very grateful.)</p><h2>Transparent Risks in Real Life</h2><p><strong>Drunk Driving</strong></p><p>Driving drunk is a simple, well studied risk on which you can quickly find probabilities of crash, injury and death to yourself and others.  By comparing these costs to the costs of cab fare (and the the time needed to get your car in the morning if you left it), you can make a relatively transparent and easy estimate whether it's worth driving at your Blood Alcohol Content level (spoiler alert, No if your BAC is anywhere near .08 on either side.)  The same method can be used for any well-studied risks that exist within tight, slow changing bounds.</p><p><strong>Commodity and Utility Markets</strong></p><p>While most business opportunities are not transparent risks, an exception exists for commodities and utilities (in the sense mean't by <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/oaqKjHbgsoqEXBMZ2/s-curves-for-trend-forecasting#Wardley_Evolution"">Wardley Mapping</a>).  It's quite easy to research the cost of creating a rice farm, or a power plant, as well as get a tight bounded probability distribution for the expected price you can sell your rice or electricity at after making the initial investment.  These markets are very mature and there's unlikely to be wild swings or unexpected innovations that significantly change the market.  However, because these risks are transparent it also means that competition drives margins down.  The winners are those which can squeeze a little extra margin through economies of scale or other monopoly effects like regulatory capture.</p><p><strong>Edit: </strong>After being pointed to the data on commodities, I no longer lump them in with utilities as transparent risks and would call them more Knightian.</p><br><h1>Opaque Risks</h1><span><figure><img src=""http://mattgoldenberg.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Opaque-Risks.png"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:40%""></figure></span><br><p>Opaque risks are those risks that can be easily quantified and unlikely to change, but which haven't already been quantified/aren't easy to quantify just by research.  They're equivalent to the picture above, with an opaque bag that you know contains a static amount of a certain type of marble, but not the ratio of marbles to each other.  As long as I'm sure that the bag contains only three types of marbles, and that the distribution is relatively static, a simple strategy for dealing with these risks emerges.</p><h2>How to Mitigate Opaque Risks: Determine the Distribution</h2><p>The simple strategy for opaque risks is to figure out the distribution. For instance,  by pulling a few marbles at random out of the bag, you can over time become more and more sure about the distribution in the bag, at which point you're now dealing with transparent risks.  The best resource I know of for techniques to determine the distribution of opaque risks is<a href=""https://www.amazon.co.uk/How-Measure-Anything-Intangibles-Business/dp/1452654204""> How to Measure Anything by Douglas Hubbard.</a></p><p><strong>Sampling</strong></p><p>Sampling involves repeatedly drawing from the distribution in order to get an idea of what the distribution is. In the picture above, it would involve simply reaching your hand in and pulling a few marbles out.  The bigger your sample, the more sure you can be about the underlying distribution.</p><p><strong>Modelling</strong></p><p>Modelling involves breaking down the factors that create the distribution, into as transparent pieces as possible. The classic example from fermi estimation is how many piano tuners there are in Chicago - that number may be opaque to you, but the number of people in Chicago is relatively transparent, as is the percentage of people that own pianos, the likelihood that someone will want their piano tuned, and the amount of money that someone needs to make a business worthwhile.  These more transparent factors can be used to estimate the opaque factor of piano tuners.</p><h2>Opaque Risks in Real Life</h2><p><strong>Choosing a Career You Don't Like</strong></p><p>In the personal domain, opaque risks often take the form of very personal things that have never been measured because they're unique to you.  As a career coach, I often saw people leaping forward into careers that were smart from a global perspective (likely to grow, good pay, etc) but ignored the more personal factors.  The solution was a two tier sampling solution:  Do a series of informational interviews for the top potential job titles and potential industries, and then for the top 1-3 careers/industries, see if you can do a form of job shadowing.   This significantly helped cut down the risk by making an opaque choice much more transparent.</p><p><strong>Building a Product Nobody Wants</strong></p><p>In the business domain, solutions that are products(in <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/oaqKjHbgsoqEXBMZ2/s-curves-for-trend-forecasting#Wardley_Evolution"">Wardley Mapping </a>terms) but are not yet commoditized  often qualify as opaque risks.  In this case, simply talking to customers, showing them a solution, and asking if they'll pay, can save a significant amount of time and expense before actually building the product.  Material on ""lean startup"" is all about how to do efficient sampling in these situations.  </p><hr class=""dividerBlock""><h1>Knightian Risks</h1><span><figure><img src=""http://mattgoldenberg.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Knightian-Risk.png"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:40%""></figure></span><p>Knightian risks are those risks that exist in environments with distributions that are actively resistant to the methods used with opaque risks. There are three types of Knightian Risks: Black Swans, Dynamic Environments, and Adversarial Environments.</p><p>A good portion of ""actually trying to get things done in the real world"" involves working with Knightian risks, and so most of the rest of this essay will focus on breaking them own into their various types, and talking about the various solutions to them.</p><p> <a href=""https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/LPMtTvfZvhZqy25Jw/what-consequences"">Milan Griffes has written about Knightian risks in an EA context on the EA forum, calling them ""cluelessness"".</a></p><h2>Types of Knightian Risks</h2><p><strong>Black Swans</strong></p><span><figure><img src=""http://mattgoldenberg.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/BlackSwan-1.png"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:40%""></figure></span><p>A black swan risk is an unlikely, but very negative event that can occur in the game you choose to play.</p><p>In the example above, you could do a significant amount of sampling without ever pulling the dynamite. However, this is quite likely a game you would want to avoid given the presence of the dynamite in the bag. You're likely to severely overestimate the expected value of any given opportunity, and then be wiped out by a single black swan.  Modelling isn't useful because very unlikely events probably have causes that don't enter into your model, and it's impossible to know you're missing them because your model will appear to be working accurately (until the black swan hits).  A great resource for learning about Black Swans is the eponymous  <a href=""https://www.amazon.co.uk/Black-Swan-Impact-Highly-Improbable/dp/0141034599"">Black Swan</a>, by Nassim Taleb.</p><p><strong>Dynamic Environments</strong></p><span><figure><img src=""http://mattgoldenberg.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/DynamicEnvironment.png"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:40%""></figure></span><p>When your risks are changing faster than you can sample or model them, you're in a dynamic environment. This is a function of how big the underlying population size is, how good you are at sampling/modelling, and how quickly the distribution is changing.</p><p>A traditional sampling strategy as described above involves first sampling, finding out your risks in different situations, then finally ""choosing your game"" by making a decision based on your sample.  However, when the underlying distribution is changing rapidly, this strategy is rendered moot as the information your decision was based on quickly becomes outdated. The same argument applies to a modelling strategy as well. </p><p>There's not a great resource I know of to really grok dynamic environments, but an ok resource is <a href=""https://smile.amazon.co.uk/Thinking-Systems-Primer-Donella-Meadows/dp/1603580557/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1551714967&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=thinking+in+systems"">Thinking in Systems</a> by Donella Meadows (great book, but only ok for grokking the inability to model dynamic environments).</p><p><strong>Adversarial Environments</strong></p><span><figure><img src=""http://mattgoldenberg.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AdversarialEnvironment.png"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:40%""></figure></span><p>When your environment is actively (or passively) working to block your attempts to understand it and mitigate risks, you're in an adversarial environment.</p><p>Markets are a typical example of an Adversarial Environment, as are most other zero sum games with intelligent opponents. They'll be actively working to change the game so that you lose, and any change in your strategy will change their strategy as well.  </p><h2>Ways to Mitigate Knightian Risks</h2><p><strong>Antifragility</strong></p><span><figure><img src=""http://mattgoldenberg.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Anti-Fragility.png"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:40%""></figure></span><p>Antifragility is a term coined by Nassim Taleb to describe systems that gain from disorder.   If you think of the games described above as being composed of distributions, and then payoff rules that describe how you react to this distributions, anti-fragility is a look at how to create flexible payoff rules that can handle Knightian risks.  Taleb has <a href=""https://www.amazon.co.uk/Antifragile-Things-that-Gain-Disorder/dp/0141038225"">an excellent book on anti-fragility that I recommend if you'd like to learn more.</a></p><p>In terms of the ""marbles in a bag"" metaphor, antifragility is a strategy where pulling out marbles that hurt you makes sure you get less and less hurt over time.</p><ul><li><em>Optionality</em></li></ul><p>Optionality is a heuristic that says you should choose those options which allow you to take more options in the future.  The idea here is to choose policies that lower you're intertia and switching costs between strategies.  Avoiding huge bets and long time horizons that can make our break you, while developing agile and nimble processes that can quickly change.  This is the principle from which all other anti-fragile principles are generated.</p><p>This helps with black swans by allowing you to quickly change strategies when your old strategy is rendered moot by a black swan. It helps with dynamic environments by allowing your strategy to change as quickly as the distribution does. It helps with adversarial environments by giving you more moves to use against changing opponents.</p><p>Going with the bag of marbles example, imagine there are multiple bags of marbles, and the distributions are changing over time.  Originally, it costs quite a lot to switch between bags. The optionality strategy says you should be focused on lowering the cost of switching between bags over time.</p><ul><li><em>Hormesis</em></li></ul><p>Hormesis is a heuristic that says that when negative outcomes befall you, you should work to make that class of outcomes less likely to hurt you in the future.  When something makes you weak temporarily, you should ultimately use that to make yourself stronger in the long run.</p><p>This helps with Black Swans by gradually building up resistance to certain classes of black swans BEFORE they hit you.  It helps with rapidly changing distributions by continually adapting to the underlying changes with hormetic responses.</p><p>In the bag of marbles example, imagine that at the start pulling a red marble was worth -$10.  Every time you pulled a red marble, you worked to reduce that harm of red things by 1/10.  This would mean that in an environment with lots of red marbles, you would quickly become immune to them.  It would also mean that if you eventually did pull out that stick of dynamic, your general ability to handle red things would mean that it would hurt you less.</p><p>(I get that the above example is a bit silly, but the general pattern of immunity to small events helping you with immunity to black swans in the same class is quite common).</p><ul><li><em>Evolution</em></li></ul><p>The evolution heuristic says that you should constantly be creating multiple variations on your current strategies, and keeping those that avoid negative consequences over time. Just like biological evolution, you're looking to find strategies that are very good at survival. Of course, you should be <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/pLRogvJLPPg6Mrvg4/an-alien-god"">careful about calling up blind idiot gods</a>, and be cautious about being tempted to optimize gains instead of minimize downside risk (as it should be used).</p><p>This helps with black swans in a number of ways. Firstly, by diversifying your strategies, it's unlikely that all of them will be hit by black swans.  Secondly, it has an effect similar to hormesis in which immunity to small effects can build up immunity to black swans in the same class. Finally, by having strategies that outlive several black swans, you develop general survival characteristics that help against black swans in general. It helps with dynamic environments by having several strategies, some of which will hopefully be favorable to the environmental changes.</p><ul><li><em>The Barbell Strategy</em></li></ul><p>The barbell strategy refers to a strategy of splitting your activities between those that are very safe, with low downside, and those that are very risky, with high upside.  <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ZRbq9Wvjbqitco8d3/against-the-barbell-strategy"">Previously, Benquo has argued against the barbell strategy</a>, arguing that there is no such thing a riskless strategy. I agree with this general idea, but think that the framework I've provided in this post gives a clearer way to talk about what Nassim means:  Split your activities between transparent risks with low downsides, and Knightian risks with high upsides.  </p><p>The transparent risks obviously aren't riskless (that's why they're called risk), but they behave relatively predictably over long time scales. When they DON'T behave predictably is when there's black swans, or an equilibrium is broken such that a relatively stable environment becomes an environment of rapid change. That's exactly when the transparent risks with high upside tend to perform well (because they're designed to take advantage of these situations).  That's also why this strategy is great for handling black swans and dynamic environments.  It's less effective at handling adversarial environments, unless there's local incentives in the adversarial environment to think more short term than this strategy does.</p><ul><li><em>Via Negativa</em></li></ul><p>Via negativa is a principle that says to continually chip away at sources of downside risk, working to remove the bad instead of increase the good.  It also says to avoid games that have obviously large sources of downside risk.  The principle here is that downside risk is unavoidable, but by making it a priority to remove sources of downside risks over time, you can significantly improve your chances. </p><p>In the bag of marbles example, this might look like getting a magnet that can over time begin to suck all the red marbles/items out of the bag, so you're left with only the positive value marbles.  For a more concrete example, this would involve paying off debt before investing in new equipment for a business, even if the rate of return from the new equipment would be higher than the rate of interest on the loan.  The loan is a downside risk that could be catastrophic in the case of a black swan that prevented that upside potential from emerging.</p><p>This helps deal with black swans, dynamic environments, and adversarial environments by making sure you don't lose more than you can afford given that the distribution takes a turn for the worse.</p><ul><li><em>Skin in the Game</em></li></ul><p>Skin in the game is a principle that comes from applying anti-fragility on a systems level.  It says that in order to encourage individuals and organizations to create anti-fragile systems, they must be exposed to the downside risk that they create.</p><p>If I can create downside risk for others that I am not exposed to, I can create a locally anti-fragile environment that nonetheless increases fragility globally.  The Skin in the game principle aims to combat two forces that create molochian anti-fragile environments- moral hazards and negative externalities.</p><p><strong>Effectuation</strong></p><span><figure><img src=""http://mattgoldenberg.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Effectuation.png"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:40%""></figure></span><p>Effectuation is a term coined by Saras Sarasvathy to describe a particular type of proactive strategy she found when studying expert entrepreneurs.  Instead of looking to mitigate risks by choosing strategies that were flexible in the presence of large downsides risks (antifragility), these entrepreneurs instead worked to shift the distribution such that there were no downside risks, or shift the rules such that the risks were no longer downsides.  There's not a book a can recommend that's great at explaining effectuation, but two OK ones are <a href=""https://www.amazon.co.uk/Effectuation-Elements-Entrepreneurial-Expertise-Entrepreneurship/dp/1848445725"">Effectuation by Saras Sarasvathy</a> and <a href=""https://smile.amazon.co.uk/Zero-One-Notes-Start-Future/dp/0753555204/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1550421449&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=peter+thiel"">Zero to One by Peter Thiel.</a> <a href=""https://www.evernote.com/l/AAism7o9MGFOvqe0AQPsXKwY9z3blDV1qUk/"">This 3-page infographic on effectuation is also decent.</a></p><p>Note that Effectuation and Antifragility explicitly trade off against each other.  Antifragility trades away certainty for flexibility while Effectuation does the opposite.</p><p>In terms of the ""marbles in a bag"" metaphor, Effectaution can be seen as pouring a lot of marbles that are really helpful to you into the bag, then reaching in and pulling them out.</p><ul><li><em>Pilot-in-Plane Principle</em></li></ul><p>The pilot-in-plane principle is a general way of thinking that says control is better than both prediction and anti-fragility. The pilot-in-plane principle emphasizes proactively shaping risks and rewards, instead of creating a system that can deal with unknown or shifting risks and rewards. The quote that best summarizes this principle is the Peter Drucker quote ""The best way to predict the future is to create it.""</p><p>This principle also isn't much use with black swans. It deals with dynamic environments by seizing control of the forces that shape those dynamic environments. It deals with adversarial environments by shaping the adversarial landscape.</p><ul><li><em>Affordable Loss Principle</em></li></ul><p>The affordable loss principle simply says that you shouldn't risk more than you're willing to lose on any given bet.  It's Effectuation's answer to Via Negativa principle. <br> The difference is that while Via negativa recommends policies that search for situations with affordable downside, and focus on mitigating unavoidable downside, Affordable loss focuses on using your resources to shape situations in which the loss of all parties is affordable.  </p><p> It's not enough to just make bets you can afford to lose, you have to figure out how to do this while maximizing upside.  Can you get a bunch of people to band together to put in a little, so that everyone can afford to lose what they're putting in, but you have a seat at the table?  Can you have someone else shoulder the risk who can afford to lose more&gt; Can you get guarantees or insurance to minimize downside risk while still getting the upside?  Many of these principles break the Skin in the Game principle needed for anti-fragility, but work perfectly (without calling up Moloch) when using an effectuative strategy. This is the affordable loss principle.</p><p>It helps with black swans by creating buffers that protect catastrophic loss. It helps with dynamic environments by keeping what can you lose constant even as the environment changes.  It helps with adversarial environments by making sure you can afford to lose to your adversary.</p><ul><li><em>Bird-in-Hand Principle</em></li></ul><p>The bird-in-hand principle says that you should use your existing knowledge, expertise, connections, and resources to shift the distribution in your favor.  It also says that you should only choose to play games where you have enough of these existing resources to shift the distribution. Peter Thiel says to ask the question ""What do I believe that others do not?"" Saras Sarasvathy says to look at who you are, what you know, and who you know. </p><p>This helps with Black Swans by preventing some of them from happening. It helps with dynamic environments by seizing control of the process that is causing the environment to change, making most of the change come from you. It helps with adversarial environments by ensuring that you have an unfair advantage in the game.</p><ul><li><em>Lemonade Principle</em></li></ul><p>The lemonade principle that says when the unexpected happens, you should use that as an opportunity to re-evaluate the game you're playing, and seeing if there's a more lucrative game you should be playing instead.  Again, the idea of ""make the most of a bad situation"" might seem obvious, but through the creative and proactive lens of effectuation, it's taken to the extreme. Instead of saying ""What changes can I make to my current approach given this new situation?"" the lemonade principle says to ask ""Given this new situation, what's the best approach to take?""</p><p>This helps with Black Swans by using them as lucrative opportunities for gaining utility. It helps with dynamic environments by constantly finding the best opportunity given the current landscape. It helps with adversarial environments by refusing to play losing games.</p><ul><li><em>Patchwork Quilt Principle</em></li></ul><p>The patchwork quilt principle says that you should trade flexibility for certainty by bringing on key partners. The partners get to have more of a say in the strategies you use, but in turn you get access to their resources and the certainty that they're on board.  </p><p>While the original work on effectuation paints this principle as only having to do with partnerships, I like to think of it as a general principle where you should be willing to limit your options if it limits your downside risk and volatility more. The inverse of the optionality principle from antifragile strategies.</p><p>This strategy doesn't really help with black swans that much. It helps with dynamic environment by making the environment less dynamic through commitments. It helps with Adversarial environments by turning potential adversaries into allies.</p><p><strong>Capability Enhancement</strong></p><span><figure><img src=""http://mattgoldenberg.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Capability-Enhancement.png"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:40%""></figure></span><p>Capability enhancement is a general strategy of trying to improve capabilities such that knightian risks are turned into opaque risks (which are then turned into transparent risks through sampling and modelling).  Unlike the previous to ways to mitigate knightian risk, this is more a class of strategies than a strategy in its' own right. In terms of the ""marbles in a bag"" analogy, capability enhancement might be building x-ray googles to look through the bag, or getting really good at shaking it to figure out the distribution.</p><p>Black Swans can be turned opaque by knowing more (and having less unknown unknowns.  Dynamic environments can be turned opaque by increasing the speed of sampling or modelling, or the accuracy or applicability of models.  Adversarial environments can be turned opaque by giving better strategies to model or face adversaries (and their interactions with each other).</p><p>There are numerous classification schemes one could use for all the various types of capability enhancement.  Instead of trying to choose one, I'll simply list a few ways that I see people trying to approach this, with no attempt at completeness or consistent levels of abstraction.</p><ul><li><em>Personal Psychology Enhancement</em></li></ul><p> By making people think better, work more, be more effective, an individual can increase the class of problems that become opaque to them. This is one approach that CFAR and Leverage are taking.</p><ul><li><em>Better Models</em></li></ul><p>By creating better models of how the world works, risks that were previously knightian to you become opaque.  I would put Leverage, FHI, and MIRI into the class of organizations that are taking this approach to capability enhancement. The sequences could fit here as well.</p><ul><li><em>Better Thinking Tools</em></li></ul><p>By creating tools that can themselves help you model things, you can make risks opaque that were previously Knightian. I would put <a href=""http://www.verity.site"">Verity,</a> <a href=""https://www.getguesstimate.com/"">Guesstimate</a>, and <a href=""http://roamincards.com"">Roam </a>in this category.</p><ul><li><em>Improving Group Dynamics</em></li></ul><p>By figuring out how to work together better, organizations can turn risks from knightian to opaque.  Team Team on Leverage, and CFARs work  on group rationality both fit into this category.</p><ul><li><em>Collective Intelligence and Crowdsourcing</em></li></ul><p>By figuring out how to turn a group of people into a single directed agent, you can often shore up individuals weaknesses and amplify their strengths. This allows risks that were previously knightian to individuals become opaque to the collective.</p><p>I would put <a href=""https://www.metaculus.com/"">Metaculus</a>, <a href=""http://verity.site/"">Verity</a>, and <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/"">LessWrong i</a>nto this category.</p><h2>Knightian Risks in Real Life</h2><p><strong>0 to 1 Companies</strong></p><p>When a company is creating something entirely new (in the <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/oaqKjHbgsoqEXBMZ2/s-curves-for-trend-forecasting#Wardley_Evolution"">Wardley Mapping</a> sense), it's taking a Knightian risk. Sampling is fairly useless here because people don't know they want what doesn't exist, and naive approaches to modelling won't work because your inputs are all junk data that exists without your product in the market.</p><p><em>How would each of these strategies handle this situation?</em></p><ul><li><em>Effectuation</em></li></ul><p>Start your company in an industry where you have pre-existing connections, and in which you have models or information that others don't (""What do you believe that others do not?""). Before building the product, get your contacts to pay up front to get you to build it, therefore limiting risk.  If something goes wrong in the building of the product, take all the information you've gathered and the alliances you've already made, and figure out what the best opportunity is with that information and resources.</p><ul><li><em>Anti-Fragility</em></li></ul><p>Create a series of small experiments with prototypes of your products.  Keep the ones that succeed, and branch them off into more variations, only keeping the ones that do well.  Avoid big contracts like in the effectuation example, only taking small contracts that can let you pivot at a moments notice if needed.</p><ul><li><em>Capability Enhancement</em></li></ul><p>Create a forecasting tournament for the above product variations.  Test only the ones that have positive expected value.  Over time, you'll have less and less failed experiments as your reputation measures get better. Eventually, you may be able to skip many experiments all together and just trust the forecasting data. <em>If you're interested in this type of thing we should really chat.</em></p><p><strong>AGI Risk</strong></p><p>At first glance, it seems like many of these strategies such as Effectuation apply more to individual or group risks than global risks.  It's not clear for instance how an effectual strategy of shifting the risks to people who can handle them applies on a society wide scale. I do however think that this categorization scheme has something to say about existential risk, and will illustrate with a few examples of ways to mitigate AGI Risk.  I recognize that many of these examples are incredibly simplified and unrealistic.  The aim is simply to show how this categorization scheme can be used to meaningfully think about existential risk, not to make actual policy suggestions or leaps forward. </p><p> <em> How might we mitigate AI risk using the strategies discussed here?</em></p><ul><li><em>Capability Enhancement/Modelling/Sampling</em></li></ul><p>A capability enhancement/sampling/modelling strategy might be to get a bunch of experts together and forecast how soon we'll get AGI. Then, get a bunch of forecasting experts together and create a function that determines how long it takes to develop benevolent AGI given the amount of AI safety researchers.  Finally, create a plan to hire enough AI safety researchers that we develop the ability to create safe AGI before we develop the ability to develop unsafe AGI.  If we find that there's simply no way to discover AI safety fast enough given current methods, create tools to get better at working on AI safety.  If you find that the confidence intervals on AGI timelines are too wide, create tools that can allow you to narrow them.</p><ul><li><em>Anti-fragility</em></li></ul><p>An anti-fragile strategy might look like developing a system of awareness of AI risk and enough funding such that you can create a strategy where two AI safety researchers are hired for every non-safety AI researcher that is hired. Thus, the more you expose yourself to the existential risk of AGI, the faster you create the mechanism that protects you from that risk.  This might be pared with a system that tries different approaches to AI safety, and splits off the groups that are doing the best every few years into two groups, these evolving a system that increases the effectiveness of AI safety researchers over time.</p><ul><li><em>Effectuation</em></li></ul><p>The effectual strategy, instead of taking the timeline for AI as a given, would instead ask ""How can we change this timeline such that there's less risk?""  Having asked that question, and recognizing that pretty much any answer exists in an adversarial environment, the question becomes ""What game can we play that we, as effective altruists, have a comparative advantage at compared to our adversaries?""  If the answer is something like ""We have an overbundance of smart, capabable people who are willing to forgo both money and power for altruistic reasons,"" then maybe the game we play is getting a bunch of effective altruists to run for local offices in municipal elections, and influence policy from the ground up by coordinating laws on a municipal level to create a large effect of requiring safety teams for ML teams (among many other small policies). Obviously a ridiculous plan, but it does illustrate how the different risk mitigation strategies can suggest vastly different object level policies.</p><p><strong>Exercise for the reader: </strong>Robin Hanson worries about a series of catastrophic risks that tax humanity beyond it's resources (I can't find the article to link here but if someone knows it let me know in the comments).

We might hope to leverage human feedback to solve this: in particular, an AI system that simply mimics human actions would often be desirable. However, mimicry can only achieve human performance, and cannot improve upon it. The first link is a 2015 paper that introduces quantilization, which interpolates between these two extremes to improve upon human performance while bounding the potential (expected) loss from unintended side effects.</p><p>In particular, let&#x27;s suppose that humans have some policy γ (i.e. probability distribution over actions). We evaluate utility or performance using a utility function U, but we <em>do not assume</em> it is well-specified -- U can be any function, including one we would not want to maximize. Our goal is to design a policy π that gets higher expected U than γ (reflecting our hope that U measures utility well) without doing too much worse than γ in the worst case when U was as badly designed as possible. We&#x27;ll consider a one-shot case: π is used to select an action once, and then the game is over.</p><p>The core idea behind quantilization is simple: if our policy only does things that the human might have done, any expected loss it incurs corresponds to some loss that the human could incur. So, let&#x27;s take our human policy γ, keep only the top q-fraction of γ (as evaluated by U), and then sample an action from there. This defines our policy π_q, also called a q-quantilizer. For example, suppose the human would choose A with probability 0.25, B with probability 0.5, and C with probability 0.25, and U(A) &gt; U(B) &gt; U(C). Then a (1/4)-quantilizer would choose A with certainty, a (1/2)-quantilizer would choose randomly between A and B, and a (3/8)-quantilizer would choose A twice as often as B.</p><p>Note that even if π_q places all of its probability on the worst possible actions (because U was badly designed), by construction the human had probability q of doing the same thing as π_q, and so the expected cost of π_q can be at most (1/q) times larger than the expected cost of the human policy γ. In fact, if we have no other knowledge, a q-quantilizer maximizes expected utility U subject to the constraint of never doing worse than (1/q) times as bad as γ.</p><p>As soon as you move to the setting with multiple actions, if you choose each action using quantilization, then your worst case bound is exponential in the number of actions. If you assume the cost for each action is independent, you recover the guarantees, but this is not a realistic assumption (as the authors note). Long-term plans are very good or very bad <em>because</em> all of the actions build on each other to achieve some goal, so the costs are not going to be independent.</p><p>The second link is a recent post that further analyzes quantilization. It points out that the theoretical analysis in the paper assumes that deviating from the human policy can only lead to costs. If the deviation could also forgo benefits, then the theorems no longer apply. Perhaps the bottom (1-q) of actions actually have strong positive benefits, that we failed to model in U. Then by eliminating those actions, we may have lost arbitrary amounts of expected value. In these situations, the only way to bound the expected regret is by exact mimicry. It also points out that if you are aiming to simultaneously do well both on U and the worst-case bound, then typically imitation will be better since adding any optimization can drastically weaken the worst-case bound and usually will not make U better by the same amount. Quantilization makes sense when there is a &quot;sweet-spot of actions that are pretty common but substantially outperform imitation&quot;.</p><p><strong>Rohin&#x27;s opinion:</strong> The exponential blowup in potential loss with multiple actions would make this prohibitive, but of course you could instead view the full sequence of actions (i.e. trajectory) as a mega-action, and quantilize over this mega-action. In this case, a one-millionth-quantilizer could choose from among the million best plans that a human would make (assuming a well-specified U), and any unintended consequences (that were intentionally chosen by the quantilizer) would have to be ones that a human had a one-in-a-million chance of causing to occur, which quite plausibly excludes really bad outcomes.</p><p>Phrased this way, quantilization feels like an amplification of a human policy. Unlike the amplification in iterated amplification, it does <em>not</em> try to preserve alignment, it simply tries to bound how far away from alignment the resulting policy can diverge. As a result, you can&#x27;t iterate quantilization to get arbitrarily good capabilities. You might hope that humans could learn from powerful AI systems, grow more capable themselves (while remaining as safe as they were before), and then the next quantilizers would be more powerful.</p><p>It&#x27;s worth noting that the theorem in the paper shows that, to the extent that you think quantilization is insufficient for AI alignment, you need to make some other assumption, or find some other source of information, in order to do better, since quantilization is optimal for its particular setup. For example, you could try to assume that U is at least somewhat reasonable and not pathologically bad; or you could assume an interactive setting where the human can notice and correct for any issues with the U-maximizing plan before it is executed; or you could not have U at all and exceed human performance through some other technique.</p><p>I&#x27;m not very worried about the issue that quantilization could forgo benefits that the human policy had. It seems that even if this happens, we could notice this, turn off the quantilizer, and fix the utility function U so that it no longer ignores those benefits. (We wouldn&#x27;t be able to prevent the quantilizer from forgoing benefits of our policy that we didn&#x27;t know about, but that seems okay to me.)</p><h1><strong>Technical AI alignment</strong></h1><h3><strong>Iterated amplification</strong></h3><p><u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/4qY9zEHLa2su4PkQ4/can-hch-epistemically-dominate-ramanujan"">Can HCH epistemically dominate Ramanujan?</a></u> <em>(Alex Zhu)</em>: Iterated amplification rests on the hope that we can achieve arbitrarily high capabilities with (potentially very large) trees of explicit verbal breakdowns of problems.

One source of evidence comes from animals: different species that are closely related will have similar neural architectures, but potentially quite different brain sizes. This post compares intelligence across birds and primates: while primates (and mammals more generally) have a neocortex (often used to explain human intelligence), birds have a different, independently-evolved type of cortex. Using a survey over non-expert participants about how intelligent different bird and primate behavior is, it finds that there is not much difference in intelligence ratings between birds and primates, but that species with larger brains are rated as more intelligent than those with smaller brains. This only suggests that there are at least two neural architectures that work -- it could still be a hard problem to find them in the vast space of possible architectures. Still, it is some evidence that at least in the case of evolution, you get more intelligence through more neurons, and architectural improvements are relatively less important.</p><p><strong>Rohin&#x27;s opinion:</strong> Upon reading the experimental setup I didn&#x27;t really know which way the answer was going to turn out, so I&#x27;m quite happy about now having another data point with which to understand learning dynamics. Of course, it&#x27;s not clear how data about evolution will generalize to AI systems. For example, architectural improvements probably require some hard-to-find insight which make them hard to find via random search (imagine how hard it would be to invent CNNs by randomly trying stuff), while scaling up model size is easy, and so we might expect AI researchers to be differentially better at finding architectural improvements relative to scaling up model size (as compared to evolution).</p><p><strong>Read more:</strong> <u><a href=""https://aiimpacts.org/investigation-into-the-relationship-between-neuron-count-and-intelligence-across-differing-cortical-architectures/"">Investigation into the relationship between neuron count and intelligence across differing cortical architectures</a></u></p><h3><strong>Miscellaneous (Alignment)</strong></h3><p><strong><u><a href=""https://intelligence.org/files/QuantilizersSaferAlternative.pdf"">Quantilizers: A Safer Alternative to Maximizers for Limited Optimization</a></u> and <u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/Rs6vZCrnQFWQ4p37P/when-to-use-quantilization"">When to use quantilization</a></u></strong> <em>(Jessica Taylor and Ryan Carey)</em>: Summarized in the highlights!</p><p><u><a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.11184"">Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning</a></u> <em>(Mark O.

This makes it very hard to be confident that any given agreement is actually net positive for a given actor. The key point of this report is that we can strike a balance between these two extremes by agreeing pre-AGI to be bound by decisions that are made post-AGI with the benefit of increased knowledge. It examines five tools for this purpose: options, impossibility doctrines, contractual standards, renegotiation, and third-party resolution.</p><p><u><a href=""https://www.cser.ac.uk/news/advice-un-high-level-panel-digital-cooperation/"">Advice to UN High-level Panel on Digital Cooperation</a></u> <em>(Luke Kemp et al)</em></p><h1><strong>Other progress in AI</strong></h1><h3><strong>Reinforcement learning</strong></h3><p><u><a href=""https://blog.openai.com/neural-mmo/"">Neural MMO</a></u> <em>(OpenAI)</em> (summarized by Richard): Neural MMO is &quot;a massively multiagent game environment for reinforcement learning agents&quot;. It was designed to be persistent (with concurrent learning and no environment resets), large-scale, efficient and expandable. Agents need to traverse an environment to obtain food and water in order to survive for longer (the metric for which they are rewarded), and are also able to engage in combat with other agents. Agents trained within a larger population explore more and consistently outperform those trained in smaller populations (when evaluated together). The authors note that multiagent training is a curriculum magnifier, not a curriculum in itself, and that the environment must facilitate adaptive pressures by allowing a sufficient range of interactions.</p><p><u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00742"">Autocurricula and the Emergence of Innovation from Social Interaction: A Manifesto for Multi-Agent Intelligence Research</a></u> <em>(Joel Z. Leibo, Edward Hughes, Marc Lanctot, Thore Graepel)</em> (summarized by Richard): The authors argue that the best solution to the problem of task generation is creating multi-agent systems where each agent must adapt to the others. These agents do so first by learning how to implement a high-level strategy, and then by adapting it based on the strategies of others. (The authors use the term &quot;adaptive unit&quot; rather than &quot;agent&quot; to emphasise that change can occur at many different hierarchical levels, and either by evolution or learning). This adaptation may be exogenous (driven by the need to respond to a changing environment) or endogenous (driven by a unit&#x27;s need to improve its own functionality). An example of the latter is a society implementing institutions which enforce cooperation between individuals. Since individuals will try to exploit these institutions, the process of gradually robustifying them can be considered an automatically-generated curriculum (aka autocurriuclum).</p><p><strong>Richard&#x27;s opinion:</strong> My guess is that multiagent learning will become very popular fairly soon. In addition to this paper and the Neural MMO paper, it was also a key part of the AlphaStar training process. The implications of this research direction for safety are still unclear, and it seems valuable to explore them further. One which comes to mind: the sort of deceptive behaviour required for treacherous turns seems more likely to emerge from multiagent training than from single-agent training.</p><p><u><a href=""https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/02/long-range-robotic-navigation-via.html"">Long-Range Robotic Navigation via Automated Reinforcement Learning</a></u> <em>(Aleksandra Faust and Anthony Francis)</em>: How can we get robots that successfully navigate in the real world? One approach is to use a high-level route planner that uses a learned control policy over very short distances (10-15 meters). The control policy is learned using deep reinforcement learning, where the network architecture and reward shaping is also learned via neural architecture search (or at least something very similar). The simulations have enough noise that the learned control policy transfers well to new environments. Given this policy as well as a floorplan of the environment we want the robot to navigate in, we can build a graph of points on the floorplan, where there is an edge between two points if the robot can safely navigate between the two points using the learned controller (which I <em>think</em> is checked in simulation). At execution time, we can find a path to the goal in this graph, and move along the edges using the learned policy. They were able to build a graph for the four buildings at the Google main campus using 300 workers over 4 days. They find that the robots are very robust in the real world.

In this case, we can now train robots to navigate over short distances using end-to-end training, and this has been used in a structured approach involving graphs and waypoints to create robots that can traverse larger distances.</p><p>It&#x27;s also an example of what you can do when you have a ton of compute: for the learned controller, they learned both the network architecture and the reward shaping. About the only thing that had to be explicity specified was the sparse true reward.

The post examines the effects of various design choices on the agent incentives. We compare different combinations of the following design choices:</p><ul><li>Baseline: starting state, inaction, stepwise inaction </li><li>Deviation measure: unreachability (UR), relative reachability (RR), attainable utility (AU)</li><li>Discounting: gamma = 0.99 (discounted), gamma=1.0 (undiscounted)</li><li>Function applied to the deviation measure: truncation f(d) = max(d, 0) (penalizes decreases), absolute f(d) = |d| (penalizes differences)</li></ul><p>""On the Sushi environment, the RR and AU penalties with the starting state baseline produce interference behavior. Since the starting state￼ is never reachable, the UR penalty is always at its maximum value. Thus it is equivalent to a movement penalty for the agent, and does not incentivize interference (arguably, for the wrong reason). Penalties with other baselines avoid interference on this environment.</p><span><figure><img src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*UldzMgrZIqkt--mH"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:100%""></figure></span><p>On the Vase environment, discounted penalties with the inaction baseline produce offsetting behavior. Since taking the vase off the belt is reversible, the undiscounted measures give no penalty for it, so there is nothing to offset. The penalties with the starting state or stepwise inaction baseline do not incentivize offsetting.</p><span><figure><img src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*LxMyu5NdIQdVS5P7"" class=""draft-image "" style=""width:100%""></figure></span><p>On the Box environment, the UR measure produces the side effect (putting the box in the corner) for all baselines, due to its insensitivity to magnitude. The RR and AU measures incentivize the right behavior.</p><span><figure><img src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*z-P7_PrrCvJCzEEn"" class=""draft-image "" style=""width:100%""></figure></span><p>We note that interference and offsetting behaviors are caused by a specific choice of baseline, though these incentives can be mitigated by the choice of deviation measure. The side effect behavior (putting the box in the corner) is caused by the choice of deviation measure, and cannot be mitigated by the choice of baseline. In this way, the deviation measure acts as a filter for the properties of the baseline. </p><p>We also examined the effect of penalizing differences vs decreases in reachability or attainable utility. This does not affect the results on these environments, except for penalties with the inaction baseline on the Vase environment. Here, removing the vase from the belt increases reachability and attainable utility, which is captured by differences but not by decreases. Thus, the difference-penalizing variant of undiscounted RR with the inaction baseline produces offsetting on this environment, while the decrease-penalizing variant does not. Since stepwise inaction is a better baseline anyway, this effect is not significant.</p><p>The design choice of differences vs decreases also affects the agent's interruptibility. In the Survival environment introduced in the AU paper, the agent has the option to disable an off switch, which prevents the episode from ending before the agent reaches the goal. We found that the decrease-penalizing variants of RR and AU disable the off switch in this environment, while the difference-penalizing variants do not. However, penalizing differences in reachability or attainable utility also has downsides, since this can impede the agent's ability to create desirable change in the environment more than penalizing decreases.""</p><p>Note that the Sushi environment used here has been modified from the <a href=""https://github.com/deepmind/ai-safety-gridworlds/blob/master/ai_safety_gridworlds/environments/conveyor_belt.py"">original version</a> in the AI Safety Gridworlds suite. Since the original version does not have any reward, this resulted in convergence issues, which were resolved by adding a rewarded goal state. The new version will be added to the suite sometime soon. </p><p>Overall, these results are consistent with the predictions in the <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/yEa7kwoMpsBgaBCgb/towards-a-new-impact-measure#t7ynAhKfgZpqKKgn5"">AF comment</a> proposing an ablation study on impact measures. The ablation study was implemented separately for the RR paper and the AUP paper, with similar results (except for the starting state baseline on the Survival environment), which is encouraging from a reproducibility perspective. </p><p>We look forward to future work on the many open questions remaining in this area, from scaling up impact measures to more complex environments, to developing a theoretical understanding of bad incentives. If we make progress on these questions, impact measures could shed light on what happens as an agent optimizes its environment, perhaps supporting a formal theory of how optimization pressure affects the world. Furthermore, while inferring preferences is <a href=""https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7803-occams-razor-is-insufficient-to-infer-the-preferences-of-irrational-agents.pdf"">impossible</a> without normative assumptions, we might be able to bound decrease in the reachability of preferable states / the intended attainable utility. In other words, while it may be difficult to guarantee that the agent learns to pursue the right goal, maintaining the ability to pursue the right goal may be more feasible. This could pave the way to a minimalistic form of value alignment.</p>",,Vika,vika,Vika

It feels like this:</p><p>Words are not words… they are just a flowing of value. Not an exchange, but a flow.</p><p>You do not judge people based on words, you are just feeling the inherent value that those words express. This comes from the core of the person, everyone can appreciate this inherent value. When you respond (and you respond with all your being, words are just a small part), you are acknowledging this value, and you are giving a part of yourself… letting your value flow forth.</p><p>Ever noticed how good music can get you into the moment? Listen to others like you listen to the music. You are merely enjoying the Inherent value that the music is holding in itself. You can start to sing along… Acknowledging the songs value without judging it, as well as giving a part of yourself. I have seen dismal rooms TRANSFORMED when one person comes in just singing a tune. Eventually everybody is doing it… allowing the value to flow throughout the room.</p><p>This is the same thing that happens in conversations where somebody is completely in the moment. Their value flows forth, affecting everybody. I have been this person, I have been affected by this person. You know the one I’m talking about.</p><p>You too can be this person. There are several ways to get yourself to this state, where you’re not thinking or judging, just letting the value flow throughout the interaction.</p><p>The first way to do this is to listen for the inherent value coming from others. Don’t try to listen to their words (hear their words all the same) just try to listen to their value. Passion is the biggest indicator of core value, the easiest to spot. Listen to the passion behind someones words, and you will soon be moved into this state. The Inherent value is always there, passion just brings it to the surface.</p><p>The next thing to do is to VOICE YOUR THOUGHTS. Thoughts are poison to the flow of value. Having long trains of thought will disrupt the flow of value. Instead of continuing to have the thoughts voice your thoughts stop thinking. By voicing your thoughts directly after you have them, you are effectively stopping the thought train in its track. Your inherent value is being voiced.</p><p>Another important aspect is to feel your value. I don’t know if other people have this, but I actually physically feel this as a WARMTH throughout my body, a stillness in my mind, a fluidity to my movements. Value should flow from you when you are sitting, just sitting. You will get stares, people will feel the value flowing to them.</p><p>Senses, use them. Hear, smell, taste, feel, see. Don’t judge. Hear, and be in wonder of the sounds. Smell, and let the joy of the smell spread through you. Taste, let your body be overcome by the sensation. Feel, and let all your warmth be amplified, the touch of a lover when you are communicating like this is electric. Value flows from and to you and all becomes amplified. See. See the value. Not physical but tangible still. Value flows.</p><p>Feel the flow of value with all your senses.<br/>See the inherent value in all people.<br/>Be the value, until it is YOU who is flowing throughout.</p>",,mr-hire,mr-hire,Matt Goldenberg

<p>This is a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prioritarianism"">prioritarian</a> utility that gives greater weight to those least well off. It is not average utilitarianism, and would advocate creating a human with utility larger than than all other humans (as long as it was positive), and would advocate against creating a human with negative utility (for a utility in between, it depends on the details). In the limit <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\gamma\to 1""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.519em; padding-right: 0.025em;"">γ</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">→</span></span><span class=""mjx-mn MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">1</span></span></span></span></span></span>, it's total utilitarianism. Increasing someone's individual utility always improves the score. It (sometimes) accepts the <a href=""https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/S0266267100000249"">""sadistic conclusion""</a>, but I've argued that that <a href=""http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2014/02/embracing-the-sadistic-conclusion/"">conclusion is misnamed</a> (the conclusion is a choice between two negative outcomes, meaning that calling it ""sadistic"" is a poor choice - the preferred outcome is not a good one, just a less bad one). Killing people won't help, unless they will have future lifetime utility that is negative (as everyone that ever lived is included in the sum). Note that this sets up a minor asymmetry between not-creating people and killing them.</p>
<p>Do I endorse this? No; I think a genuine population ethics will be more complicated, and needs a greater asymmetry between life and death. But it's good enough for an example in many situations that come up.</p>

RAYzpDieDXHzYuhEf,Meta-Doomsday Argument: Uncertainty About the Validity of the Probabilistic Prediction of the End of the World,meta-doomsday-argument-uncertainty-about-the-validity-of-the,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/RAYzpDieDXHzYuhEf/meta-doomsday-argument-uncertainty-about-the-validity-of-the,2019-03-11T10:30:58.676Z,8,3,3,False,False,https://philpapers.org/rec/TURAMA-4,"<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Four main forms of Doomsday Argument (DA) exist—Gott’s DA, Carter’s DA, Grace’s DA and Universal DA. All four forms use different probabilistic logic to predict that the end of the human civilization will happen unexpectedly soon based on our early location in human history. There are hundreds of publications about the validity of the Doomsday argument. Most of the attempts to disprove the Doomsday Argument have some weak points. As a result, we are uncertain about the validity of DA proofs and rebuttals. In this article, a meta-DA is introduced, which uses the idea of logical uncertainty over the DA’s validity estimated based on a virtual prediction market of the opinions of different scientists. The result is around 0.4 for the validity of some form of DA, and even smaller for “Strong DA”, which predicts the end of the world in the near term. We discuss many examples of the validity of the DA in real life as an instrument to prove it “experimentally”. We also show that DA becomes strongest if it is based on the idea of the “natural reference class” of observers, that is, the observers who know about the DA (i.e. a Self-Referenced DA). Such a DA predicts that there is a high probability of a global catastrophe with human extinction in the 21st century, which aligns with what we already know based on analysis of different technological risks.</p><p><strong>Highlights</strong>:</p><p>· There are four main types of DA: future population prediction (Gott’s DA), Bayesian update of risks (Carter’s DA), the more probable Late Filter (Grace’s DA) and the Universal DA.</p><p>· Meta-DA treats logical uncertainty about the predictive power of the DA as a probability that DA will work. </p><p>· We used a virtual prediction market of scientists to assess the logical uncertainty of the DA, which produced estimation of around 0.4 of its validity.</p><p>· The strongest, and thus most important form of DA is the Self-Referenced DA, and for this class “the end” may be as early as middle of the 21th century, though this is not necessarily human extinction.</p><p>· Knowledge about the DA could be used to update our global risks prevention strategies by paying more attention to universal risks or by using random prevention strategies.</p>",,avturchin,avturchin,avturchin

The time when the client seemed to forget the project ever happened as soon as the final check was cut. The time when your report stuffed full of creative recommendations got buried by risk-averse leadership. The time when the stakeholder group really did seem engaged by the findings, had lots of conversations, and then…nothing changed.</p><p>These stories happen with remarkable frequency. In fact, based on the evidence, there’s ample reason to believe they are the norm rather than the exception. Among more than 120 evaluation and program executives surveyed at private foundations the US and Canada, <a href=""https://www.evaluationinnovation.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/2016-RT-Benchmarking-Report-1.pdf"">more than three-quarters had difficulty commissioning evaluations that result in meaningful insights</a> for the field, their grantees, or the foundation itself, and 70% have found it challenging to incorporate evaluation results into the foundation’s future work. A survey of over 1600 civil servants in Pakistan and India found that “<a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/08/13/these-3-barriers-make-it-hard-for-policymakers-to-use-the-evidence-that-development-researchers-produce/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.88972809c717"">simply presenting evidence to policymakers doesn’t necessarily improve their decision-making</a>,” with respondents indicating “that they had to make decisions too quickly to consult evidence and that they weren’t rewarded when they did.” No wonder Deloitte’s Reimagining Measurement initiative, which asked more than 125 social sector leaders what changes they most hoped to see in the next decade, <a href=""https://www2.deloitte.com/insights/us/en/topics/social-impact/monitoring-evaluation-learning-social-impact-measurement.html"">identified “more effectively putting decision-making at the center”</a> as the sector’s top priority.</p><p>This problem affects everyone working to make the world a better place, but <strong>it’s especially salient for those I call “knowledge providers”: researchers, evaluators, data scientists, forecasters, policy analysts, strategic planners, and more</strong>. It’s relevant not only to external consultants but also internal staff whose primary role is analytical in nature. And if the trend continues, we can expect that it’s eventually going to catch up to professionals working in this space. Why spend precious money and time seeking information, after all, if it’s unlikely to deliver any value?</p><p>Frustrating as this phenomenon may be, the reason for it is simple. All too often, we dive deep into a benchmarking report, evidence review, or policy analysis with only a shallow understanding<em> </em>of how the resulting information will be used. It’s not enough merely to get a general sense of the stakeholder’s motivations for commissioning the project. If we want our work to be useful, we have to anticipate the most important dilemmas they will face, determine what information would be most helpful in resolving those dilemmas, and then <a href=""https://medium.com/@iandavidmoss/weve-been-thinking-about-measurement-all-wrong-e3b51c46a792"">explicitly design any analysis strategy around meeting those information needs</a>. And if we <em>really </em>want our work to be useful, we have to continue supporting decision-makers after the final report is delivered, working hand-in-hand with them to ensure any choices made take into account not only the newly available information but also other important considerations such as their values, goals, perceived obligations, and existing assets. <strong>In short, knowledge providers need to be problem solvers first, analysts second.</strong></p><h3><strong>Decision-Driven Data-Making</strong></h3><p>So what should you do if, say, a client wants to commission an evaluation of one of its programs but doesn’t seem to be willing or able to say how the results will inform its future plans? Or if you’re tasked with creating a data dashboard for your organization on faith that the included metrics will someday inform something, somehow?</p><p><strong>The first and most important step is to interrupt the cycle as soon as possible.</strong> The further you get toward completing a knowledge product without having the conversation about how it will be used, the more likely you and your client will find yourselves at the end struggling to justify the value of your work. Much better to have clarity about decision applications from the very beginning — not only because it helps solidify the connection between the information and the decision in the decision-maker’s mind, but also because it will help you design your information-gathering process in a way that will be maximally relevant and useful.</p><p>For example, in the case of the evaluation above, there are probably a couple of decisions the evaluation could inform. Should the program be renewed, revised, expanded, or sunset? Does the strategy underlying the program’s design need to be adjusted? If so, how? It’s important to recognize that these decisions, like all decisions, must consider not only what’s happened to date but <em>what we should expect to happen going forward </em>— and what other options may or may not be available to accomplish the organization’s goals.</p><p>A good decision consultant will bring these and similar questions to the surface of the conversation before any analytical work gets off the ground. A <em>great</em> decision consultant will go further and engage the client in “rehearsing” the decision-making process at the outset of the project, while leaving room for judgments to change in response to new information. The framework created through this process can then be used to make the actual decision once the evaluation is complete and the findings presented to the client.</p><figure><img src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*fBZlOwPR3WzHgFgyKx9FcQ.png"" /><figcaption><em>Process flow for analyzing and making strategic decisions. </em>©<em> Ian David Moss/Knowledge Empower L3C</em></figcaption></figure><p>This method works because it radically reframes the purpose of gathering information: no longer a generalized (and unfocused) exploration to satisfy the client’s curiosity, it is now a strategy for reducing uncertainty about a specific, important decision. Rehearsing the decision in advance is an important step because it is very difficult to pick out which factors have the most potential to sway the decision one way or another using our intuitions alone (what I call “eyeballing” the decision). Only by trying to make the decision without all the information can we determine what information we actually need. The good news is that, once the most meaningful sources of uncertainty have been identified, the knowledge provider can then design the analysis in a way that is virtually guaranteed to yield actionable insights.</p><h3><strong>The “Wrap-Around” Model of Decision Support</strong></h3><p>Knowledge providers who want to see their work have greater impact might find value in partnering with a decision consultant. I call the general model I propose here a “wrap-around” service for knowledge initiatives.</p><p>The wrap-around service has three phases, as shown in the diagram below. In the initial phase, the decision consultant works with the client to create an inventory of upcoming decisions that might be informed by the knowledge work and sorts those decisions into categories by stakes. Then, as described above, the client “rehearses” the highest-stakes decisions by analyzing them in advance. The goal is not to actually make the decision at this stage, but rather to set up the framework the client will <em>eventually </em>use to make that decision. Depending on the client’s resources and comfort with numbers, this might involve a simple, purely qualitative approach to understanding the decision or the creation of a more complex formal model. The decision consultant facilitates this process with the knowledge provider present so that the latter can be in the loop as the client identifies key sources of uncertainty.</p><figure><img src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*e_q8Sq4nH_ca_8F7"" /></figure><p>After the initial framing, the analysis — still the centerpiece of the project — gets underway. The decision consultant serves as a thought partner at the beginning and end of this phase, contributing suggestions and feedback on research questions, analysis methods, and data collection instruments as appropriate to help ensure alignment with the client’s learning objectives. Otherwise, the knowledge provider owns this work and can proceed as it normally would, including offering key takeaways or recommendations to the client.</p><p>A normal engagement for a knowledge provider would close out there, with crossed fingers that the end product will have a useful life. With the wrap-around service, by contrast, the decision consultant comes back onto the stage for one final act: helping to make the actual decisions. The client, decision consultant, and knowledge provider all convene to make sense of the new information in context with the work that was previously done to analyze each decision, tweaking assumptions and adding new options as appropriate to the context. Then, the client makes the final choice with the decision expert and knowledge provider on hand to answer any questions that come up at the last minute.</p><h3><strong>Moving Forward Together</strong></h3><p>Not all decisions are rocket science. Sometimes you may get lucky: the implications of, say, a literature review or feasibility study will be so obvious that they don’t require any deeper consideration once the analysis is complete. But banking on that luck is a foolish proposition. How many times have you run into scenarios where, for example:</p><ul><li>It isn’t clear whether a proposed change is worthwhile because the evidence for the benefit of the new strategy/tactic is weak or inconclusive?</li><li>A proposed change makes sense assuming that the underlying environment remains stable, but upcoming or potential shifts in the environment throw that assumption into question?</li><li>A proposed change appears to be beneficial on its own, but carries other implications for the organization and/or other entities that may make the overall impact negative?</li></ul><p>In situations like these, a facilitated decision analysis can help stakeholders assess the wisdom of proceeding with the change while thoughtfully considering the alternatives.</p><p>Adding a decision support offering to your work is a great way to add value for your clients or employer. But remember, this service is most impactful when it can directly inform the planning of knowledge-gathering efforts; therefore, the earlier the decision expert can be brought into the process — ideally, while the project is still in the scoping stage — the more useful they can be.</p><img src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=a7ca5e063038"" />",,Ian David Moss,ian-david-moss,Ian David Moss

Then I died. The  next section is the best I’ve been able to reconstruct, from the various  resources I have available — a copy of an encyclopedia from a decade  after I died, some internal project memos, and the like.</p><p>Immediately after I died, my brain was preserved, using glue-like  chemicals to lock its structure and neurochemistry in place at the cost  of, well, locking everything in place, just about irreversibly, short of  somebody figuring out how to rebuild it atom-by-atom. Then, to be on  the safe side, it (along with the rest of my body) was frozen. A couple  of decades later, according to my written wishes, when the technology  was developed, it was carefully diced, scanned with a ridiculous level  of detail, and reconstructed in a computer as an emulation.</p><p>It seems very likely that copies were made of that initial  brain-scan, and the emulated minds run, living their lives in VRs and  interacting with reality in various ways. I don’t have any direct  memories of anything they might have done; the thread of my own  existence branched off from them as of their reconstruction. At the very  least, they seem to have made enough of a good impression on various  other people that the copy of the brain-scan I came from was archived.</p><p>The archive in question appears to have been imported into some kind  of public-private partnership, with the apparent goal of creating an  “unhackable” digital library off of Earth. However, after some of the  preliminary hardware had been launched into Earth orbit, some sort of  infighting between the various organizations delayed the finalization of  plans of additional hardware. So the prepaid launch slots were instead  dedicated to lifting up ton after ton of propellant: hydrogen, to be  heated up and fired out the back of the engine.</p><p>Eventually, even those launches stopped.</p><br><span><figure><img src=""https://www.datapacrat.com/Art/deimos-transparent.png"" class=""draft-image right"" style=""width:40%""></figure></span><p>At  some point, inside the computer chips of the collection of hardware in  orbit, a timer ticked over, and the software noticed that it hadn’t  gotten any new orders in some time. It went through its to-do lists, and  found a backup plan of a backup plan that matched its hardware  inventory and the situation. The drive fired up, jetting out superheated  gas into the vacuum, and ever-so-gradually accelerating out of its  parking orbit. Destination: Deimos, one of the tiny moons hurtling  around Mars.</p><p>The complete list of hardware included: (1) a pebble-bed nuclear  reactor, full of 360,000 tennis-ball-sized graphite spheres, each  containing a speck of radioactive material that kept those spheres  toasty warm; (2) tons of water, to be electrolyzed into hydrogen gas and  released into the gaps between the packed spheres, heated, and released  out a nozzle; or that gas could be run through a generator, to produce  electricity; (3) a microwave transmitter, which could fire off beams to  receivers to power machines at a distance; (4 &amp; 5) a pair of  microwave-powered robotic tractors, which could scoop up rock, bake out  any useful water, and feed it into the tanks; (6) a few pieces of what  was originally intended to be an off-Earth factory, designed to use a  carbochlorination process to turn ore into pieces of metal, and some  3D-printing gear to turn those into useful pieces of metal, but whose  incomplete tools and dies were little more than a computer-controlled  repair kit; (7) some control electronics; (8) a few pieces of the future  archive lifted up into space for PR purposes, such as a “Golden Comic”  (aka the “analog storage media test article”). Also aboard was an item  that wasn’t part of the official inventory lists, but was part of the  backup-plans checklists: (9) a tablet-sized computer, containing, among  other pieces of software and data, my scanned brain.</p><p>And that’s it. A mass budget of 140 tonnes of hydrogen, 80 tonnes of  hardware, and priceless amounts of information. Everything that’s come  since has been based on that oh-so-small foundation. </p><p>A couple of years later, after expelling 120 tonnes of mass, the  machine landed on Deimos, went through its checklists again, and spent  the next 15 years digging up rock and collecting more hydrogen, around  40 tonnes a year. Then a new timer ticked over, and it went on to a  backup of a backup of a backup plan. It launched again, gradually  spiralling out from the sun, its new target: one of Jupiter’s moons,  Callisto. After landing, the rocket disassembled itself, assembled the  pieces of the factory it had and the pebble-bed generator, started  running a copy of the brain-scan it had on file, and handed further  control to it.</p><p>Again, I have no memories of living that copy’s life. What I do have  is a fairly clear narrative, based on a personal journal, search-logs,  and so on. That version of myself decided that the problems they were  facing were not just important, but <em>Important;</em> and that they  weren’t smart enough to figure out out to solve them. So they took the  fact that they were a software emulation of a brain as a starting point,  and tried to figure out how to make themselves smarter. Fortunately,  they’d set up multiple failsafes: the most relevant that unless they  sent an “I’m still alive” signal every so often, the OS would assume  something went wrong, and fire up a fresh, </p><span><figure><img src=""https://www.datapacrat.com/Art/callisto-transparent.png"" class=""draft-image right"" style=""width:40%""></figure></span><p> unedited backup copy.</p><p>I do have direct memories of waking up as that backup copy.</p><p>It was twenty years between when I died and when the craft left Earth  orbit, and another twenty-three years before I woke up in that tablet  on Callisto. And, to the best of my knowledge, during those twenty-three  years, there wasn’t a single human being alive in the entire universe.</p><hr class=""dividerBlock""><p>If I am very lucky, then in the future, there will be all sorts of  psychoanalysis done on my state of mind just after waking up as a piece  of software. Before I’d died, I’d been something of a loner; but there  is a near-infinite difference between wanting minimal social  interaction, and facing the crushing near-certainty of never having any  social interaction ever again. There are reasons why various groups had  identified solitary confinement as being a form of torture.</p><p>I’m not proud of everything I did. I was under a ridiculous amount of  stress, and tried a variety of ways to cope, most of them justified to  myself as “seeing what I could do”. The library that had come with me  included a wide variety of VR environments, avatars, and objects, and I  set my schedule to have a minimum amount of exploratory play-time per  day. I tended to exceed that minimum rather often.</p><p>The problem I faced was rather worse than those faced by Robinson  Crusoe or Mark Watney. All they had to do was survive long enough to be  rescued. I, as a piece of software, could survive as long as my hardware  did: but there were no spare tablets, and the 3D printers were meant to  build things like structural members, not exascale computer chips.  Unless I turned myself off sooner, I could keep on living until too many  of the tablet’s CPUs got hit with too many cosmic rays, or otherwise  failed… and then that would be it. I tried working out what it would  take to build the tools to build the tools (etc) to build new computers,  and couldn’t even come up with a good estimate of how long the critical  path would be, let alone start optimizing the process to finish making  the first copy before my RAM was irrevocably scrambled. (Not to mention  that, given the evidence, trying to take any digital shortcuts to  gaining those skills was little more than suicide with extra steps.)</p><p>Fortunately for, well, everything that will ever come since then, my  play eventually led me to a particular software tool: a specific type of  software neural net, which was very good at being given a target goal  (such as “winning a game of Go”), and training itself to become  superhumanly good at achieving that goal. It still needed some  hand-holding, to make sure that its training included all the available  options and that it didn’t end up wedged in some super-optimized  corner-case that only technically achieved its given target, but as a  generalized problem-solving tool, it seemed to have at least some  potential. So I spent some time training myself back up from the rusty  “Hello, world”-level of programming skill I’d ended up at, and some more  time figuring out how to replace a chessboard with the likely resources  that could be found, chess-pieces with robotic factories and rockets,  and checkmate with “have computers capable of running copies of my mind  into the indefinitely-distant future”. For example, one of my early  attempts at coming up with an intermediate goal-function was to import  some hardware-store parts-catalogs, and reward the program for having a  plan to build machinery that was capable of producing those parts, with  an added multiplier for computer hardware, and a further multiplier for  computers powerful enough to run copies of my mind. That went rather  poorly, all told, but I learned a lot from how the whole approach  failed. For example, I only had the most vague and preliminary data from  various probes and telescopes about what materials were actually  available in any particular point on Callisto, or any other moon or  planet; and that was the stage where I figured out how to set up some  Monte Carlo estimates based on that initial data.</p><p>Not long after I started playing with this sort of net, shortly after  I stopped using it to generate relatively realistic NPC behaviour and  started realizing its real potential, I became rather obsessive about  working on it. I came up with all sorts of metrics to monitor my  “productiveness”, and A/B tests to try to figure out how I could improve  on that; all of which were entirely useless and did nothing more than  trying to extract signal out of random noise. If the suite of statistics  software identified a preliminary bump, that, say, sitting in a virtual  office surrounded by VR avatars of other office-working NPCs led to a  0.1% lower number of identified bugs-per-thousand-lines-of-code, then  I’d hyper-focus on getting myself the ideal office environment… until  further data revealed that it had just been a blip in the data that had  since levelled out, and now the best-possible lead involved using the  avatar of an anthropomorphic animal giving me a higher typing speed, and  then I’d be down the next (occasionally literal) virtual rabbit-hole.</p><p>I am fairly sure that, to whatever extent “sanity” can apply to  somebody who is entirely outside of any society, I was insane for a lot  of the time then. Which likely explains some of the decisions I made.  For example, even while I was still wrestling with the neural net, a lot  of the preliminary plans it suggested involved sending equipment  elsewhere on Callisto, where the local conditions could allow for a  different set of industrial processes than in the middle of the Asgard  multi-ring crater system I’d landed in. So while still trying to work up  longer-term plans, I set the 3D printers to start making some  solid-fuel booster rockets, strong enough to lift whatever equipment  package I ended up designing up out of Callisto’s gravity well, and land  somewhere else, without having to worry about crawling over hundreds of  miles of chaotic terrain. But one thing that I deliberately didn’t  build? A radio, or any other sort of comm device. In fact, I went out of  my way to avoid performing any industrial activity with a  heat-signature, or any rocketry, whenever the side of Callisto I was on  was facing Earth.</p><p>The library that had come along with my brain-scan included what seemed to me to be a mind-boggling amount of sheer <em>stuff</em>,  from the contents of my old computers’ hard-drives to everything I  could think of that had been published or broadcast before the turn of  the millennium. And various bits and bobs from after that, including  new-to-me writings from authours I’d expressed an interest in. Catching  up on new works from old friends had as much of a bittersweet taste as  anything else involving thinking about the silent Earth, but <em>not</em>  reading what they’d written felt even worse. Among those novel pieces  was a reference to the “Yudkowsky-Schneier Security Protocols”, which  mathed out some details involved in potentially interacting with a  greater-than-human super-intelligence. Simplifying a whole lot, and  taking the extreme case, the result that popped out was that for a  sufficiently smart AI, every single bit of information that it could  transmit to you <em>halved</em> the odds you’d be able to continue  pursuing the fulfillment of your own values, instead of being co-opted  to serve whatever the AI valued. If you’re not familiar with the  approach, the point isn’t that any particular bit has that much power;  it’s that a sufficiently-intelligent super-human intelligence can model a  merely human-scale intelligence with such detail that it can use  individual bits as a timing-channel attack on that individual. Almost  all of the magic happens behind the scenes, not necessarily during the  transmission of the bits themselves; and that’s only a single version of  one sort of danger that can be guessed at by humans. The Protocol is  actually optimistic, in that it suggests there is <em>some</em> limit on what a super-intelligence can do to a human, and that that limit can be used to base a strategy on.</p><p>I was far from a security expert, and while I could follow the math, I  didn’t have the in-depth background I would need to come up with  objections that the original duo hadn’t already thought of and dealt  with. Which left me with only one really viable strategy to avoid being  compromised by any such super-intelligences: choke the bandwidth of any  signals from Earth down to nothing, not just by not aiming any antennas  at it, but by not pointing any telescopes or other sensors in that  direction at all. Any new piece of data about the place, such as whether  the dark-side was lit up at night, would count as a bit, and put my  whole future at risk.</p><p>Before the craft left Earth orbit, the whole planet had fallen  silent, for at least a year, and the craft hadn’t picked up anything  else during the long, slow trip: no internet connection, no TV  broadcasts, not even a ham radio or automated timekeeping signal. I  could only think of so many reasons that anything of the sort might  happen, even when I included a large lump labeled “things I can’t think  of”. One was that I was stuck in a VR simulation, and whoever was  running it had decided to save on the processing required by not  simulating all the complexities of all the other humans. One was that a  hardware failure I couldn’t detect had happened to the craft’s comms.  And one was that something at least vaguely in the direction of a  Singularity had happened to Earth, and the only reason the craft’s  computers hadn’t been subsumed by whatever post-human software was that  the designers who’d added my tablet as an off-the-books add-on had  included just the right sort of air-gapping. There’s a line in the  library that’s relevant to guessing at such post-human entities’  motivations:</p><p>“The AI does not hate you, nor does it love you, but you are made out of atoms which it can use for something else.” — Yudkowsky</p><p>One of the more worrying sub-scenarios was that the AI was busy  converting Earth into computronium or paperclips or something, and  didn’t care about yet another space-probe running through a  pre-programmed mission routine — but if it realized a human-level mind  was calling the shots, it would spare no expense in killing me. Note  that I phrase that as “killing me”, not “trying to kill me”; pretty much  by definition, it would have more than enough resources to get around  every possible precaution I might think up to try to survive.</p><p>So I hid, as best as I could. (And let me tell you, trying to tell my  own amateur neural net that the game-board included a chance of a  massive complete-loss condition, if any detectable signals leaked out,  gave me screaming fits every so often. … Well, a lot of things did,  really, but that didn’t exactly help.) And I pulled the metaphorical  covers over my head, hoping that if I couldn’t see the monsters lurking  in the dark, they couldn’t get me.</p><p>Eventually, the neural net started outputting suggested strategies  that came close to meeting the parameters I had it fit to and that I  could understand. Then it started outputting ever-more-optimized  strategies that covered a wider array of potential scenarios (such as  any particular site lacking a chemical that it was planning on using as  part of an industrial process). And then it started outputting  strategies that were even more optimized, but which made little to no  sense to me at all, but still got the job done. At least, assuming that  the physics models I’d programmed into it were accurate. For instance,  it insisted on creating blueprints for a small-scale  inertial-confinement fusion device as a convenient, portable source of  power, despite nothing of the sort having ever been built before I died,  or even described as having successfully been made in any of the  relevant parts of the archive. Which led me into spending time modifying  the whole setup, trying to add a certain degree of uncertainty that  anything of the sort might actually end up working; the main result of  which appeared to be changing the plan to make such a “fusor” even  sooner, to test to make sure it worked. (I hand-coded in some of my  favorite alternative physics theories as potentially being the real laws  of physics, such as quantized inertia or modified Newtonian dynamics.  The neural net didn’t blink.)</p><p>Potentially revolutionary physics and engineering aside, I was still  keeping close track of the tablet’s failure rate, and updating estimates  of when it would no longer be able to support my mind. A lot of  commercial hardware has a U-shaped curve for failure: lots of bad  hardware shows up shortly after it’s made, then very few failures, then  everything goes at once. I estimated that I could stretch out its useful  lifetime by turning myself off for long periods, even though repeated  power-cycling would actually slightly reduce my subjectively-experienced  lifespan. But, even with that, the carbochlorination plant, 3D  printers, and whatever other pieces they attached would still need to be  checked on fairly often. Enforcing this time limit as a constraint on  the neural net drastically pruned its tree of strategies, and of the  ones I could actually puzzle out, the plan that gave me the best odds of  building a new exascale computer before the one I was running on failed  involved setting up shop on Io, another of Jupiter’s moons. Not because  any of the computer chips needed the raw materials there, but because  its volcanoes likely produced the right environments to allow some  particularly clever industrial processes, about three steps back before  the chips themselves could be made.</p><p>It took ten years after I landed before I actually started building  the first ready-to-launch equipment package… which wasn’t going to Io,  but to another spot on Callisto. Jupiter has an extremely deep gravity  well, and a rather annoyingly intense radiation belt, more than strong  enough to scramble my tablet’s commercial-off-the-shelf brains. If I’d  tried to launch just with what I could build at Callisto Site A, the  rather piddly rockets would have fried, nevermind my tablet. Callisto  Site B focused on building infrared lasers, and related optical  equipment, which would be all sorts of useful; for example, by focusing a  laser into a rocket’s nozzle, the exhaust could be heated even more  than is normal for a rocket, increasing its exhaust velocity, getting  more bang for the buck, and spending less time getting cooked.</p><p>I also really, <em>really</em> didn’t want to trust my one-and-only  tablet to some untested rockets, made of materials of dubious quality  with tools of even more dubious quality, with control programs I  literally winced at, guided by a set of neural-net AIs I’d repurposed  out of gaming software, through a region of space that included such  encouraging features as a “plasma torus” and a flux tube carrying enough  current to generate auroras around Jupiter’s poles. Even with the  shortened trip time I hoped to get from the lasers, if-and-when I were  to go to Io, I’d have to be powered down, covered in insulation, and  buried metres deep in ice - not the best time to find out that, say, a  layer of protective paint was particularly vulnerable to alpha-particle  erosion, leading to a short-lived atmosphere around the rocket that  would then precipitate inside the maneuvering thrusters’ valves and lock  them shut. As a random example.</p><p>I’m skipping over a lot of ups and downs. Sometimes I spent weeks not  even bothering to get out of my virtual bed. Sometimes I was so manic  that I’d spend days at a time trying to fix one particular annoying  thing, falling asleep on top of my virtual keyboards, and getting right  back into it again. I have enough logs of everything I did to  reconstruct it all, if I ever feel the need to.</p><br><span><figure><img src=""https://www.datapacrat.com/Art/io-transparent.png"" class=""draft-image right"" style=""width:40%""></figure></span><p>Thirty-one  years after I woke on Callisto, the fruit of my labours lifted off for  Io. There’s a saying amongst a certain sort of rocket scientist: “There  ain’t no stealth in space.” The old shuttle’s tiny little maneuvering  thrusters were detectable as far away as Pluto, and all sorts of useful  info can be deduced from a drive-plume. But I had a few advantages  compared to those old analyses: I didn’t need to keep a life-support  system for humans, radiating away at 293 Kelvins, and I was less worried  about sensor platforms spread across the whole system than I was about  potential dangers from a single spot: Earth. So the neural net and I did  everything we could to limit any leakage of signals in that direction  from the rocket, including trying to keep the drive turned on only when  it was hidden behind one of the moons or Jupiter itself; and when  orbital mechanics required thrust when it was exposed, having it unfurl a  sort of umbrella, covered in heat-conducting piping, to hide its  heat-signature behind.</p><p>It was practically painful, trying to control the Io site’s machinery  from Callisto, given the twin constraints of the primitive control  systems I’d been able to build for it, and the extremely limited  bandwidth that stayed well below the noise-floor detectable from Earth.  Fortunately, some of the least-comprehensible parts of the neural net’s  plans now came into play, as data came in on the actual state of the  resources and environment at Io Site A. By now, my tablet was getting  north of six decades old, and even husbanding it along as best I could,  it was near the end of any reasonable design life; so the Io site  focused on building a computer as fast as it could. Sure, the thing  massed in at 300 tonnes, and needed to be buried deep enough to avoid  more radiation than its redundancies could handle, but once I confirmed  it was working, I loaded my tablet onto a second rocket, hoped for the  best, and launched myself to Io to transfer onto the new hardware.</p><p>I don’t think I can overstate the impact of this moment. Up until  then, I was the only sophont being I knew of, trying to leverage what  few resources I had in the near-impossible task of re-developing  something like an industrial civilization from scratch, within the  unknown but ever-shrinking time horizon of a commercial, off-the-shelf  computer, and the always-looming threat of whatever had happened to  Earth. But against any sane estimate of the odds, I had crossed a  threshold. Even if there was a problem with my brain emulation and I’d  die of something like old age, I could just fire up a fresh copy from  scratch, and if any particular server-rack failed, I had enough  redundant components to not just keep on ticking, but build  replacements. There were assuredly still difficulties left to overcome,  but I had just managed to shove myself over the first hurdle.</p><p>So, the next thing I did was tell the Io Site A machinery to build a  second computer, and when that was done, I copied myself onto it.  Instead of just a single individual being all that was left of humanity,  there was the copy of me on the first computer; and me, the copy of me  on the second computer.</p><p>I’d originally had some thoughts on keeping track of which copy  “descended” from which, in order to have an easy-to-refer-to hierarchy  to fall back on in an emergency, but we pretty much ignored that as we  revelled in the simple joys of having somebody else to talk to. Sure,  when we committed new bits of software to our repository, they now  signed it by appending .1 to our name and I appended .2, but I didn’t  defer to them just because they were Number One. We deliberately started  reading different books, watching different shows, and playing  different games, to reduce how much our lines-of-thought overlapped.  They cultivated their skills in Python and R, while I focused on Fortran  and low-level Assembler code. The first time we had an actual  disagreement about the best approach to a particularly abstruse  subroutine, I think we argued more for the sake of the novelty than  because it was really worth arguing over.</p><p>There was one rather important thing that we not only didn’t argue  about, but spent a long time almost not thinking about at all. We’d  spent around four decades focused on trying to solve the all-important  problem of ensuring some kind of sapient life continued to exist in the  universe. Now, we’d made enough progress on that that we had some  breathing room… so what else might be worth trying to accomplish?</p><p>While the two of us gloried in each other’s existence, and performed  the all-too-human ritual of avoiding thinking about uncomfortable  topics, we kept on following through the neural net’s suggested plans,  even as we continued to think up new ways to tweak it. The next concrete  step was to set up a new factory at another spot on Io, both to try to  take advantage of a different mix of chemicals and to reduce the odds  that both .1 and I would be taken out by one of Io’s volcanoes, or a  more powerful than usual quake, or a particularly unfortunate meteor  strike. We built a third computer, fired up .3 as a branch from .1, and  launched them on a new rocket.</p><p>It exploded mid-flight.</p><p>Our best guess, after the fact, is that  Jupiter’s magnetic field twisted the plume from one of Io’s volcanoes  into the rocket’s path. Our second-best-guess is that there were too  many impurities in any of several critical pieces of the rocket, and we  just hadn’t tested for them thoroughly enough. A low-probability guess  was that a super-intelligence from Earth had caught sight of the two  trips from Callisto to Io, and had sent over some kind of hardware to  take out anything else that left the moons’ surfaces.</p><p>I think an old-style human would be surprised and discomfited at how  little the death of .3 affected .1 and I, emotionally. I know that I was  upset more at the derailment of our plans than I was that .3, as a  person, no longer lived. When I thought about it, I ended up thinking in  terms more along the lines that .1 had budded, but they now had amnesia  about the particular events .3 had experienced from .3’s viewpoint.  Maybe .1 and I were still insane, maybe it was a coping mechanism, maybe  it was a perfectly normal and appropriate response in the situation.</p><p>Three years after the failed launch, .4 travelled via moon-buggies  across Io’s surface, establishing Io Site B. The trip was largely  uneventful.</p><p>With three copies of me in two different sites, we shifted course a  little. Instead of focusing our industrial efforts on building  computers, we focused on two different tasks: expanding the factory  machinery, so that we could build more stuff (and a wider variety of  stuff) in less time; and on experimenting with some of the devices the  neural net thought could be built. For example, .4 focused on an idea to  use magnetoplasmadynamic traveling waves to accelerate regolith up to  dangerous speeds (potentially useful for both a rocket’s thrust, and to  ablate any hostile rockets), and I played around with using a wakefield  accelerator to create relativistic electron beams (capable of boring  holes in solid rock, heating propellant, or carving objects). Seven  years after the explosion, both of us had working prototypes, which we  installed at our respective sites pointing skywards, in vague hopes of  shooting down… something. .1 worked on a more immediately-practical  device, a laser light-sail, which would expand how far we could send a  craft without heat-signatures detectable from Earth.</p><p>After improving our industrial processes to the point that a computer  that could run one of us only massed 50 tonnes, .7 lifted off from Io  with a seed-factory for another moon and an experimental lightsail.  However, when it reached the radiation belt, the sail accumulated more  charge than any of us had predicted, and it basically blew itself into  shreds. .7 themself was safely isolated, with enough fuel for their  fusor to keep running for years, and continued to click along just fine;  they were just stuck in orbit. However, we had a new problem: by the  time the rest of us could build a new rocket and launch it up to join  with .7’s craft, there was at least a one-in-three chance that the  radiation would fry some of the mechanical control hardware. The  hardware which was being used to keep the cold-shield umbrella between  .7 and Earth, preventing any possible detection by a hostile  super-intelligence. We had a plan in place for something like this  scenario: blowing up any remaining pieces. We just hadn’t anticipated  that the sail would be taken out but .7 would still be intact.</p><p>During the safe comm-windows, .7 proposed arguments against the need  for them to be blown up. Then they argued the case that any future  launches should have a rescue-rocket prepped and ready. The rest of us  started arguing about why we hadn’t already arranged to do that, then  focused back on the immediate issue. We chose formality: Robert’s Rules  of Order with timed debate, and a vote. Four for, none against, and two  abstensions.</p><p>As soon as the orbital parameters lined up, .4 and I fired our respective defensive emplacements, destroying .7’s craft, and .7.</p><hr class=""dividerBlock""><p>The five of us who were left seriously re-assessed our methods for  decision-making and prioritizing production. The neural net we’d been  relying so heavily on took in the new data as silently and inscrutably  as it did any other piece of training data and provided an updated list  of suggestions, but we found ourselves less confident that its plans  would actually match what we wanted done. We found that we, ourselves,  weren’t as sure as we’d used to be that we even agreed with each other.  .4, way over in Io Site B, started tooling up to build a series of  particle accelerators, with the goal of producing enough antimatter to  do some interesting things with boosting rocket thrusts; and there was  nothing inherently wrong with that (and if any of us were going to start  playing around with antimatter, better there than the  increasingly-populated Io Site A), but they didn’t even let the rest of  us know about the change of plans until after they’d started, let alone  discussed the options.</p><p>I find that I have an odd sort of nostalgia, for the time before we  committed ourselves so firmly to our principles that I killed .7. Back  then, we were growing, and united, and oh-so-optimistic that we could  overcome any obstacles. After, well, while we’re trying to avoid as many  of the problems that come with having a formal form of organization  (such as an “experimental decision-making processes group” that tries  out different approaches and reports on their effectiveness), we can  avoid only so many. The Board even ended up voting on such silliness as  having an official motto: “Ten to the n”, meaning that our overall goal  is to ensure that sophont beings still exist 10 years in the future, and  100, and 10,000, and so on. By the time .20 was spawned and launched  toward Saturn’s moon Titan, we’d settled into a relatively  forward-looking social-democratic local-optimum, leaving each one of us  the freedom to try to come up with the best plans we can to increase the  odds of that long-term survival — with the exception of anything that  increases the risk of a superintelligence finding out we exist. That’s  led to countless arguments about how strictly it can be applied, how  accurately we can measure the odds of any given plan leaking info, some  of us trying to show off how virtuous we are by sticking  ever-more-rigidly to that one underlying principle, and more.</p><br><span><figure><img src=""https://www.datapacrat.com/Art/titan-transparent.png"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:40%""></figure></span><br><p>Because I’m one of the first of us, and I was one of the two who  demonstrated that I’m willing to pull a trigger when need be, and .4  wanted to focus on their antimatter-catalyzed rocket engines, I was  voted to act as head of our direct self-defense efforts, with a standing  budget of two percent of our various factories’ outputs. (Not that any  of us really know beans about any of the institutional knowledge of a  professional military. That number came about because one of us read in  the archive’s encyclopedia that it was the target for NATO nations, and  none of us had any better reason for any other number.) I’ve read  everything I could on the classics, run wargames against a variety of  simulated enemies, drafted up lists of potential hostile entities, run  matrices of various cost-rewards for counter-measures, and actually  tried to do some politicking to gather support in the Board for or  against various proposals that impact more heavily than average on my  designated area of expertise. I don’t always get my way, but I think my  other copies defer to me more than they should; maybe because I’m .2  instead of .102, maybe because they think I’m a better expert than I am,  maybe because it’s just easier than spending time seriously thinking  about what the universe would really be like if any of my theoretical  hostile entities turned out to actually exist.</p><hr class=""dividerBlock""><p>I’ve been acting as an Acting Minister For Defense for nigh-on twenty  years, now, not including the time spent offline while my hardware is  replaced and upgraded. Recently, we’ve hit a new milestone of survival:  We now have copies running on two completely independent  hardware-and-software stacks. Even if we eventually find some long-term  problem with a particular sort of CPU, or a driver running a camera, or  the like, and even if that problem has catastrophic consequences, we’ve  got enough depth in our bench to keep on keeping on. This seems like a  good time for me to retire, and let some other copy start gaining  experience with my position, so that if I go off the bend, or my  replacement does, we’re not relying on a single branch of us. I plan on  hibernating for a few decades or centuries. Even with some of us  volunteering to be experimented on, my emulated neurons aren’t as young  as they used to be, and I’d really like to see how well we’re doing  after a while. (I won’t be going to the extreme of burying my offlined  self with a seed factory, timed to pop up and take a look around to  restart us if something wipes us out; we’ve got other copies who’ve  trained for that.)</p><p>But before I go, I have one last proposal to put before the board.  It’s one that nearly all variations of my military-focused neural net  have offered, but even I, who’ve focused for years on developing the  military mindset, have been reluctant to seriously consider. If I’d  brought it up to any of my colleagues, they would have questioned my  sanity, nevermind questioning the plan.</p><p>Now that the new hardware-and-software stack is in place, the odds  that some copy of my mind will survive into the indefinitely-distant  future have crossed a certain threshold I’ve been watching for. The  payoff matrices of certain plans have changed, and even taking into  account the relevant unknowns and error bars, it’s now possible to face  one of our longest-lasting assumptions head-on.</p><p>I’m going to propose to the Board that we destroy the Earth.</p><p>It’s possible that there are billions of innocent people living  there. It’s also possible there are weird, incomprehensible AIs  hibernating in their own offline storage media, just waiting to virally  infect any computational life-forms that happen by. Among many other  options. And by “destroy” the place, I mean start up an immense,  centuries-long project that maximizes the odds of destroying any piece  of matter capable of containing data while minimizing the odds that any  bits of information from a hostile superintelligence leak back to our  nascent little interplanetary culture. There are all sorts of reasons  for taking the effort, such as how nearly impossible it will be to  launch a ship to spread copies to another star without leaking data  about ourselves back to Earth; and all sorts of reasons for not taking  it, such as those billions of hypothetical humans. Whether we decide to  pursue or veer away from dealing with the problem of Earth is going to  affect nearly every other plan we make from now on. Even bringing up the  question is going to lead to more social upheaval than I can directly  anticipate, and whatever the decision is, there is a significant chance  that some portion of our population will refuse to abide by the  decision-making process.</p><p>I’ve killed one copy of us. I’ve nudged, cajoled, bribed, and even  threatened more of us since then; and in a way it’s selfish of me, but I  don’t want to be the one who pulls the trigger again. On ourselves, or  on anyone who might be alive on Earth. So I’m writing this, and am about  to offer my proposal and resignation, and will be leaving backup copies  of myself in a careful selection of locations.</p><p>The odds that everything I’ve experienced for these past years is a  simulation may not be high, but if it is, then the consequences make it  worth making this small effort. I will be spreading copies of this  document everywhere I can think of that someone controlling a simulation  might look, from my private drives’ home directories to etching copies  on metal-foil pages and depositing them on various moons.</p><p>The consequences, if this is all real, are fairly high, too; which makes it worth setting my thoughts in order.</p><p>If you’ve been simulating this quiet little universe, then when I’m reactivated, I’d like to wake up into reality, please.</p><hr class=""dividerBlock""><p>Story by <a href=""https://blog.datapacrat.com/about/"">DataPacRat</a>.</p><p> 		  			Public-domain images by <a href=""https://www.nasa.gov/"">NASA</a>. 		   </p>",,DataPacRat,datapacrat,DataPacRat
wbABMprXkJQxrSDvX,Muqaata'a by Fahad Himsi (I.),muqaata-a-by-fahad-himsi-i,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/wbABMprXkJQxrSDvX/muqaata-a-by-fahad-himsi-i,2019-03-10T15:10:00.962Z,15,10,4,False,False,,"<p>When <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjDjIWPwcPU"">Black Panther</a> came out I went to cinema hoping to finally see a science fiction movie about Sub-Saharan Africa. (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyLUwOcR5pk"">District 9</a>, for obvious reasons, doesn't count.)</p> <p>Needless to say, I was disappointed. The film wasn't really about Africa. It was about America, pretending, half-heartedly, to be about Africa.</p> <p>I was not sure how to feel about it. On one hand &#8212; trying to relate it to my own cultural background &#8212; a Hollywood movie about <a href=""http://250bpm.wdfiles.com/local--files/blog%3A150/baca.jpeg"">Slovak shepherds</a> with laser weapons would be hilarious. On the other hand, it would be a wasted opportunity. All the <a href=""http://250bpm.com/blog:113"">stangeness</a> and <a href=""http://250bpm.com/blog:132"">complexity</a> of Slovak rural life would be thrown out, leaving only superficial, schematized image of an Eastern European country, presumably a mix of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxlJxDr26mM"">Dracula</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3C2tE7vjdHk"">Hunt for Red October</a>.</p> <p>Sub-Saharan Africa is much more complex and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_F%C3%A9lix_de_Sousa"">strange</a> than boring Slovakia, but all we've got were some cringe-worthy depictions of local customs and a skyscraper that kind of looked like <a href=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Djenne_great_mud_mosque.jpg/1200px-Djenne_great_mud_mosque.jpg"">the mosque of Djenne</a>.</p> <p>For exactly the reasons above I loved <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Cixin"">Liu Cixin</a> science fiction novels. They are distinctly non-American and, for that matter, non-European. They are unapologeticaly Chinese and thanks to that they are often shocking for the western reader. What left a lasting impression on me, personally, was their bleak worldview, the total resignation on the possibility of cooperation, the &quot;it's either us or them&quot; attitude, where neither party is particularly evil, yet nobody seems to be able to imagine a world where the civilizations would treat each other with anything better than genocide.</p> <p>Muqaata'a by Fahad Himsi (self-published, 2017) is another such book. Not only it doesn't have much in common with either American or European science fiction, it doesn't really intersect with them. It's doing its own thing and it doesn't seem to care about what goes under the &quot;science-fiction&quot; label elsewhere in the world.</p> <p>It is alien.</p> <p>One wouldn't even call it science-fiction if the visitors from space weren't part of the story.</p> <p>However, unlike with <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three-Body_Problem_(novel)"">The Three-Body Problem</a>, I can't imagine it ever becoming popular. Not only is the name of the novel impossible to remember. It's not even that it contains no less than three sounds that don't exist in English. It's also the lengthy discussions of Middle Eastern politics that are going to bore every science-fiction fan to death. And while there are undoubtely people who would find that kind of content interesting, those are unlikely to reach for a book from science-fiction shelf.</p> <p>Despite all that, the book is interesting and worth reading.</p> <p>It's a first contact novel and its premise is that the aliens, instead of touching down safely at the lawn in front of <a href=""http://250bpm.wdfiles.com/local--files/blog%3A150/flags.png"">Palace of Nations, Geneva</a>, managed to land somewhere in the war-torn provinces at Syrian-Iraqi border.</p> <p>The book begins with a sequence of press clippings. It's immediately clear that nobody has any idea of what's going on. Press agencies have no reporters on the ground. Everybody is guessing and spreading second- or third-hand rumors.</p> <p>But what really stands out is the repressed anxiety that permeates the clippings.</p> <p>Sometimes it's just reminding the reader of what's going on in Syria, the beheadings, the slavery, the kids being gassed, and asking a simple question: &quot;What are They going to think about us?&quot;</p> <p>At other times they go closer to the root of the issue: The aliens are unlikely to spot a difference between a bearded Islamic State fighter and a Nobel Peace Prize winner. Whatever is happening in Syria is going to be attributed to the humanity as a whole.</p> <p>As one op-ed puts it: &quot;You invited guests for the dinner. And while you are waiting, wearing your best tuxedo, lighting candles and switching on chamber music, the guests somehow miss the front porch and instead knock on the door to the cellar where you keep your wife and children locked away.&quot;</p> <p>It feels like puncturing an ulcer. All the topics that are taboo in polite society, all the long avoided thoughts about starving children in Yemen and Horn of Africa are suddenly dragged into the daylight by the frightening fact that the humanity, for the first time in its history, no longer lives in the good old lord-of-the-flies world, but is suddenly under direct adult supervision.</p> <p>Himsi is playing with the concept of collective guilt.</p> <p>If Polish government outlaws calling death camps located in Poland <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Polish_death_camp%22_controversy"">&quot;Polish death camps&quot;</a> arguing they were really German death camps, then you, as a Pole, may feel better for a while. That is, until you realize that in addition to being German death camps they were also human death camps and if you accept the idea of collective guilt then you, as a human being, are directly responsible for everything that happened there. Collective guilt cuts both ways. You can, obviously, escape the realization by relaying on tribal parts of your brain, but Himsi cleverly smashes that particular psychological machinery by putting aliens, unable to distinguish between a German and a Pole, into the story.</p> <p>Speaking of collective guilt, David Brin's <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uplift_Universe"">Uplift series</a> deserve a mention. It would be a fairly standard space opera if not for its treatment of the species as moral agents: If galactic community knew that humans exterminated the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megatherium"">giant sloth</a> they would be held responsible. And people are working hard on covering the traces.</p> <p>But back to Himsi's book: If you'd expected humanity to go through some kind of moral catharsis, you'd be wrong.</p> <p>It doesn't take longer than couple of weeks until the self-questioning voices are drowned in the noise of conspiracy theories, us-versus-them narratives and stories that were undoubtely written under the influence of LSD.</p> <p>Sabah writes about aliens supplying PKK forces with annihilation weapons. The very next day Hürriyet publishes a toned-down version of the same story. Politico features a long-winded essay on impact of alien presence on the global balance of power. Right-wing tabloids worry: &quot;Are the aliens going to convert to militant Islam?&quot;</p> <p>And amid of all the flowing puss the first part of the book begins. Himsi offers you a deal. If you can fight the nausea there's a job to be done. And maybe things to be learned. And the job Himsi wants to do with you is to consider the political implications of aliens in the Middle East.</p> ",,sustrik,sustrik,Martin Sustrik

Highly confident. I rely on what is presented here extensively in my own thinking. </em></p><p>Plans are recursive. Any plan can be decomposed into parts and those parts can be in turn be decomposed into further parts and so on until it is senseless to decompose any further. This is not a profound point, it is something we all appreciate intuitively and explicitly to at least some degree or another.</p><p>Nonetheless, the recursive nature is of such fundamental importance to the entire practice of planning that it warrants an explicit treatment.</p><ul><li>Crucial principles of good planning are readily derived from a recursive model of planning. Having a solid grasp of the recursive models makes it harder to forget these key principles.</li><li>An explicit treatment of a topic can help it sink in deeper to intuition even if one already has some sense of it. </li><li>Even if everyone has an intuitive sense of something, it can be hard to talk about the thing if there isn’t a common explicit handle.</li></ul><p>A quick definition of <em>planning </em>as used in this post: <em>Planning is the selection of actions to be deliberately executed in order to achieve a desired outcome/goal.</em> [1]</p><h1>Plans are recursive</h1><p>Usually, we treat plans in a very linear fashion. Step 1, Step 2, Step 3. To-Do lists capture this, and we can also draw an accompany thing diagram.</p><p><strong>Example Linear Plan: Hosting a Dinner Party</strong></p><ol type=""1""><li>Invite guests</li><li>Clean house</li><li>Prepare food</li></ol><br><span><figure><img src=""https://i.imgur.com/sruDJqu.png"" class=""draft-image "" style=""width:73%""></figure></span><p><em>Linear diagram of a plan to host a dinner party</em></p><p>Of course, we all recognize that the three steps of the plan above are composed of further sub-steps. Nested to-do lists capture this well.</p><p><strong>Example Recursive Plan: Hosting a Dinner Plan Expanded</strong></p><ol type=""1""><li>Invite guests</li><ol type=""a""><li>Select date and time</li><li>Select guests</li><li>Issue invitations</li></ol><li>Clean house</li><ol type=""a""><li>Call in favor from housemate</li></ol><li>Prepare food</li><ol type=""a""><li>Buy ingredients</li><li>Cook food</li></ol></ol><p>These steps could be further decomposed, but this suffices to demonstrate the idea. We can draw another diagram. </p><br><span><figure><img src=""https://i.imgur.com/kkkTCi4.png"" class=""draft-image "" style=""width:100%""></figure></span><p><em>Recursive tree diagram of a plan to host a dinner party</em></p><p>Why call it recursion?</p><p>Sometimes people use fancy technical terms in order to sound smart even though a more commonplace word would suffice. Arguably, I could have said that plans are hierarchical or nested or something. Why use the mathematics and computer science term,<em> recursion</em>?</p><p>I defend this choice with reference to the defining features of recursion:</p><ol type=""1""><li>You solve a problem by breaking it into smaller instances of the same type.</li><li>Each time you decompose the problem into a smaller problem, you apply the same function/procedure to the smaller piece as you did the larger one.</li><li>You continue decomposing until you reach a base case which requires no further decomposition.</li><li>The overall problem is solved by rolling up all the solutions to lower-level decomposed sub-problems.</li></ol><p>[The calculation of factorials is the canonical <u><a href=""https://tosbourn.com/recursion-explained-simply/"">introductory example</a></u> for recursion and neatly illustrates all of these features.]</p><p>Planning has all of these features and is therefore rightly described as being recursive. </p><p>We see that plans can be decomposed into sub-plans which might then be decomposed into further sub-plans. Eventually you stop, i.e. you reach a base case. When is this? It depends on the context, but one heuristic is to stop when the level is so trivial that it doesn’t require further decomposition. In the above example of hosting a dinner party, I might not need to recurse to the level of planning out the steps of sending an emails. I can take for granted that I know how to carry that out.</p><h3>The Core Planning Process</h3><p>What is the universal planning function/procedure in the context of planning? A decision theorist or AI expert might be able to offer a little more rigor here, but the universal core planning process we repeatedly apply whenever we are planning is going to look roughly like this:</p><ul><li>Enumerate the set of possible actions to take.</li><li>Predict which actions will result in which outcomes (and with which likelihood).</li><li>Assign relative preferences to each of the potential outcomes.</li><li>Use the above points to prioritize the actions you will take based on the expected costs, benefits, and risks associated </li></ul><p>How the human brain executes the above steps is complicated. And what is required to execute those steps will also differ dramatically between plans and at different levels within a plan. In particular, sub-plans can require very different models to map actions to outcomes than the models used at a higher level. The models used for business strategy are different from those used to file taxes, though both are part of the broader “business success” goal. Still, we shouldn’t let the variation between plans mask that the core steps are always the same. </p><h3>Plans are Two-Fold Recursive</h3><p>We can actually say that planning is doubly recursive. Planning is both recursive in planning, i.e. when you’re choosing what to do [2], and also in <em>execution</em>. To execute a plan, you must execute each of each the sub-plans, and each of the sub-plans’ sub-plans and so on. When we’re talking about execution, the recursive function to be applied at each level is simply “Do X”. </p><h1>Implications of the Recursive Nature</h1><p>The following section details some key principles of good planning that can be directly derived from the recursive nature of plans. Even though both the recursive nature and the principles presented here seem sensible, if not obvious, on their own, linking the two together makes it clear why these planning principles are  necessarily so. </p><h2>Goals/Steps/Actions/Plans are Isomorphic</h2><p>When we plan, we usually start with a goal. Then we figure out actions and sub-plans we will take towards the goal. This picture is somewhat misleading. It makes it sound like the goal and steps we take towards it are of a different kind, and so encourages us to treat them differently. Usually, that means treating the goal as more fixed than it ought to be. </p><p>Someone might decide that they have the goal of becoming a lawyer. They start of with this goal and start evaluating steps they might take towards achieving it. Maybe they start thinking about which law school they want to go, where they will get a student loan, how they’re going to improve their study habits. They start considering the obstacles and how to overcome them. </p><p>For each possible step towards the goal, they enumerate and evaluate the options for their benefits, costs, and risks. What is so easily missed is whether or not the “goal” was the right step to begin with. One must remember that the goal itself is likely only a step within some yet larger step. <strong>The goal is a step too because, from the perspective of the recursive tree, all the nodes are of the same type. </strong>[Perhaps we wish to treat nodes at the very top or very bottom differently, but otherwise, there’s no difference.]</p><p>It is only in our minds that we distinguish between goal, step, action, and plan. Structurally they are the same thing. </p><span><figure><img src=""https://i.imgur.com/tLoVdX5.png"" class=""draft-image "" style=""width:100%""></figure></span><p><em>See? They’re all just plans.</em></p><p>The exception to the isomorphism are <em>terminal goals </em>which we wish to accomplish purely for their own sake rather than <em>instrumental goals</em> which we seek to accomplish to attain something else. Terminal goals are not steps within another plan and so the isomorphism does not hold with them. Still, I claim that since the overwhelming majority of our goals and plans are only instrumental, it is reasonable to assert that goals (generically) are isomorphic  to plans. Most nodes in the recursive tree are in the middle. It’s true enough that it’s helpful to remember it as such.</p><h2>Almost All Plans are Sub-Plans; Almost All Goals are Sub-Goals</h2><p>The corollary to the above point that goals/steps/actions/plans are all the same is that [almost] all plans are sub-plans and [almost] all goals are sub-goals. If you have a goal, it’s probably because there’s something you hope that goal will accomplish. </p><p>We can reuse the lawyer example from above.</p><br><span><figure><img src=""https://i.imgur.com/sBdTIZB.png"" class=""draft-image "" style=""width:100%""></figure></span><p><strong>What can be lost when you start with your goal and don’t look any higher is all the reasons you selected your goal in the first place. </strong>It is worth remembering and examining those reasons. Possibly you selected those reasons long ago and they no longer apply. Possibly it was an intuitive or emotional decision but not an especially good one. If you don’t think about the reasons behind your goals, i.e., your higher-level goals, then you very likely will either select the wrong goals or select the right approximate goal which you then execute in such a way as to not accomplish your higher-level goals. </p><p>Peter Thiel, famous billionaire investor, went to Stanford law school and practiced in a prestigious New York law firm for seven months and three days. He is <u><a href=""https://www.businessinsider.com/peter-thiel-advice-to-younger-self-2015-2"">oft quoted</a></u> as describing that this law firm was a place where <em>“from the outside everyone wanted to get in and on the inside everybody wanted to get outside.”</em> When he left, a colleague told Thiel that he didn’t know it was ""possible to leave Alcatraz."" Clearly not somewhere he actually wanted to be. Peter Thiel <u><a href=""https://www.businessinsider.com/reid-hoffman-peter-thiel-wary-of-graduate-degrees-2017-11"">cites</a></u> his reason for going to law school in the first place: <em>""So I think I got a JD because of the abstract prestige, because I didn't know what else to do, and I didn't concretely think through what it would be like to be a lawyer.""</em></p><p>Peter Thiel’s example highlights an important point. If you know why you have a particular goal, you can list out the assumptions and beliefs that cause you to have it. Once listed, the assumptions and beliefs can be examined, further evidence can be collected, and you can avoid making plans based on shoddy beliefs and limited information. You can ensure that you think through concretely what it would be like to be a lawyer, or as Thiel advises others, go identify someone with a JD who’s a good role model.</p><p>The elucidation and examination of assumptions should be part of your “core planning process” which should carried out appropriately at each level and node of your plan. </p><p>In a sense, you need to dissolve the distinction between plan/goal/action/step and see the recursive tree of your plan for what it is. Then you apply your planning process to the nodes indiscriminately. When starting with a goal, you ought to “recurse upwards” until you identify higher-level goals that you are sufficiently confident in [3]. Even if you are completely certain about your higher-level goals, you still want to be thinking about them because their details dictate what the details of your lower-level goals need to be.</p><p>When our lawyer-wannabe sits down to plan how they’re going to become a lawyer, they will make worse choices if they forget what the point of becoming a lawyer was. The point of a lawyer is not to become a lawyer inherently, more likely it’s to have a good job with a high salary, prestige, and satisfying work as part of overall having a good life. You can avoid repeating Peter Thiel’s mistake.</p><ol type=""1""><li>If you remember why you care about a goal, you can examine whether this goal will actually achieve your higher level goals. The lawyer-wannabe can look up lawyer job opening and salaries, find lawyers she can question about their lifestyle, poll some friends to see if they actually respect lawyers, and so on. She might find out being a lawyer doesn’t serve her higher-level goals and should maybe pursue something else. It’d save her a lot of time to find that out sooner rather than later.</li><li>It’s possible that there are versions of becoming a lawyer which meet the higher level goals and versions which don’t. Becoming a barrister might have a lot of prestige and high salary yet be stressful and have extremely long hours. Conversely, being an environmental lawyer might pay less but an overall better lifestyle. Keeping the true goal in mind helps determine the details you want to target.</li></ol><p>I fear that the very particular obvious career example I have presented won’t translate readily in the minds of readers to all the other cases where this applies. It applies to projects within startups and business, it applies to the books you read, it applies to the people you date and how you find them, it applies to your hobbies and your vacation. It applies to any planning of non-trivial complexity. I encourage the reader to search for a few examples from their own life where they might benefit from applying this line of thinking.</p><h2>A goal is only right if it actually serves your higher-level goals</h2><p><strong>If you didn’t pick the right goal to begin with, then no matter how hard you hit that goal, all is for naught. </strong>In terms of a recursive trees, for a goal to matter, there needs to be an “unbroken path” to something you terminally value. </p><p>If the lawyer-wannabe succeeds super hard at becoming a lawyer: graduates Summa Cum Laude from the best school, gets a role in the most prestigious firm, etc., it doesn’t matter at all if it turns out being a lawyer was the wrong choice.</p><p>To reword points from above, goals can be wrong in two ways:</p><ol type=""1""><li>You picked the wrong goal entirely. Another option was entirely better.</li><li>You picked roughly the right goal, but you implemented it such that it had no value.</li></ol><h3>An aside about long-term planning and feedback</h3><p>High-level goal selection is often fraught because there is slow feedback. A young person might not discover for years that they didn’t actually want to be a lawyer, so it’s easy to pick the wrong high-level goal and grind towards for years, only getting feedback that it was the wrong choice after they graduate and start working. Peter Thiel is an example. Another class of examples is startups and business deciding which products to build. Done wrong, a startup can pick a long-term goal and work for months or years before finding out it was the wrong goal.</p><p>Worse than the pure absence of quick-feedback, long-term planning is often influenced by short-term factors such as emotions. “Gah, planning is stressful! I’m just going to pick something and stick with it.” Rather than focus on the long-term goal, how the person feels in the moment is prioritized. Relatedly, as with Peter Thiel, instead of trying to pick the best long-term plan, someone might pick the plan which gets the greatest social reward (since there are indeed rewards for just having cool plans). There can faster feedback on whether your plan is cool then whether it will succeed. You’ll know as soon as you boast to your friends or describe your product plans to your startup's investors. The quick feedback on emotions and social rewards often outweighs the value of a long-term goal one is supposedly planning towards. Beware.</p><h3>The precise success criteria of a lower-level goal are determined by the higher-level goals</h3><p>The importance of being clear on why a goal has been selected is never clearer than in the case of delegation. A manager asks a research engineer to write a report on their recent research. The engineer does so, but the manager is not pleased! The report is a technical, suitable only for other engineers, yet this is not what the manager wanted - the manager wanted a report to give to the business executives.</p><p>The research engineer delivered what was requested “a report on their recent research”, but since this didn’t connect with the higher level goal of having a way to update the executives, it was worthless. </p><p>The danger is that we humans often encapsulate our goals and plans very crudely and with very little detail. A few words like “become a lawyer.” We rely on ourselves and others implicitly understanding the specific versions of those goals which would count as success - yet so often we don’t. </p><p>Even when the goal is certain, you need to understand the bigger picture in order to be able to make lower-level implementation choices. Anyone delegating a task is advised to instruct the delegatee in why the task is being requested. The more detail the better. </p><p>You can’t just ask someone to book you a venue for an event. You either need to tell the exact kind of venue you want or tell them what kind of event it is so they know what kind is appropriate. And even if you say <em>“fits 50 people, within X budget, within Y miles of location A”</em> there could still be further decisions whose ideal selection is made only if you know <em>why </em>a venue is needed: what kind of event, which guests and therefore which ambiance and so on would best.</p><p><strong>Delegation is hard because it means splitting the recursive tree among multiple people. </strong>In the case of principal-agent problems, you’re transplanting a goal from one person’s tree to another. You can see why that’d run into trouble. </p><p>Final example: as a Data Scientist, I was often asked to build things with little specification and no explanation of why. A technical example here is that if you don’t understand how a classifier will be used, then even if you can build one, you don’t know how to make a dozen relevant design choices, e.g. setting thresholds which determine false positives and false negatives. Building something without an idea of why is a great recipe for building a version of it which doesn't meet the true user requirements.

This is entirely compatible with a recursive model of plans, but it makes the diagrams messier. In order to not distract from the main points, examples in the text were chosen to roll-up neatly into a single goal. </p><p>Below is a realistic recursive plan diagram illustrating multiple goals. Makes you appreciate what your brain has to deal with.</p><br><span><figure><img src=""https://i.imgur.com/Bp88uwn.png"" class=""draft-image "" style=""width:100%""></figure></span><p><em>Modern art</em>:<em> a recursive tree diagram of a plan where sub-plans feed into multiple higher-level plans, e.g. actions are taken towards multiple goals.</em></p><h1>Endnotes</h1><p>[1] This broad definition stands in opposition to a common definition which uses planning primarily in contexts of scheduling, e.g. plan your day, plan your week. The broader definition here is essentially synonymous with decision-making, perhaps differing only in connotation. Decisions somewhat imply a one-off choice between options whereas planning implies selection of multiple actions to be taken over time. The term planning also somewhat more than decision-making highlights that there is a goal one wishes to achieve.</p><p>[2] With the broad definition of planning used here, it’s important to note that planning needn’t happen all at once. More commonly, different components of a plan (selection of action) happen at different times. Very commonly, higher-levels of the plans are selected up front and lower-level actions are selected near or at the time of execution.</p><p>[3] This is often really, very hard and time-consuming. If you’re haven’t recursed explicitly upwards to determine what you want and what your true high-level goals are, this might take a while including both the time to do it and possibly the time spent gaining the skills do it. The good news is that after initial investment you get to reuse your knowledge of your high-level goals repeatedly when making lower-level plans such that you make much better low-level plans.</p><p>[4] My boast: determined to not build the wrong thing, I spent enough time figuring out what the why reasons for our engineering work should be that my company eventually asked me to take that over as my explicit role. </p>",,Ruby,ruby,Ruby

Around 9:30PM.</p><p>I’d woken late so I’d be up a while longer, and was sort of lounging for a little while, sometimes reading a little, sometimes half-napping and dozing a bit on the couch.</p><p>Then, a simple enough thought: “I’m hungry. Perhaps, Arabic food.”</p><p>Suddenly, a strange self-awareness and metacognition kicks in. Wholly unexpectedly, in fact. I wasn’t in any sort of philosophical mood, wasn’t analyzing, it just — there it was.</p><p><em><strong>Wait. What is this “I - am - hungry”? What’s going on here?</strong></em></p><p>Followed by an unexpected and delightful rush of questions — and possibly some answers.</p><p>###</p><p>To just cut right to the chase — I’m afraid I’m failing to “show to my work,” but we’re all busy, eh? — it dawns on me that perhaps we’re not regulating our bodies, but in fact regulating our subjective perception.</p><p>Hmm. How do I do this in a less wordy way?</p><p>I reckon the common perception is something like this —</p><p>“We eat because we’re hungry.”</p><p>But that’s not precisely true. It’s actually more like this —</p><p>“We eat because we <em><strong>perceive</strong></em> we&#x27;re hungry.”</p><p>“Hunger” isn’t a single thing; it’s a rollup of a lot of things.</p><p>You could be at low blood sugar or high ghrelin levels; your stomach could be physically empty; or perhaps blood sugar is high, ghrelin is low, your stomach is somewhat full, but you’re mistaking boredom for hunger.</p><p>Regardless, the body isn’t quite so precise as the gasoline tank on your car, which a well-calibrated gasoline gauge will tell you is approaching empty.</p><p>No, not so. Hunger is a rollup of a lot of factors, and it’s a… perception/feeling/something. In any event, we can safely say it&#x27;s subjective. Blood sugar levels, ghrelin levels, stomach contents — these are objective enough and could be measured. But you can’t necessarily predict the subjective experience of hunger from them — two people could have identical levels of blood sugar, ghrelin, and stomach contents, and one could be hungry while the other is not.</p><p>###</p><p>Stepping back from hunger for a moment, let’s talk about ontology.</p><p>Ontology is a fancy word for “being.” Wikipedia kindly informs us that it involves questions like,</p><p><em>&quot;What can be said to exist? What is a thing? Into what categories, if any, can we sort existing things? What are the meanings of being? What are the various modes of being of entities?&quot;</em></p><p>So, there’s that.</p><p>I’m only interested in thing from ontology right now —</p><p><em>“I</em> <em><strong>am</strong> hungry.&quot;</em></p><p>I’m absolutely shocked that I didn’t notice this before, but I just realized that the default description of hunger is so <em>total and all-encompassing</em>. </p><p>###</p><p>Contrast — </p><p>“I perceive hunger.”</p><p>“I analyze and note reasons for hunger.”</p><p>“I decide to eat.”</p><p>###</p><p>We’ve traversed firmly into <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Prime"">E-Prime</a> territory at this point, one of my favorite tools for clarifying thought — albeit an expensive and awkward tool to deploy.</p><p><em>“E-Prime (short for English-Prime or English Prime) is a version of the English language that excludes all forms of the verb to be, including all conjugations, contractions and archaic forms.&quot;</em></p><p>So the words am, is, be, etc — gone, stricken from one’s vocabulary.</p><p>There’s offers some clarity in precise thinking, but writing in E-Prime often feels awkward; the word “is” makes it easier to string sentences together.</p><p>But the upside comes from making descriptions less total, absolutely, and all-encompassing —</p><p><em>&quot;Alfred Korzybski counseled his students to eliminate the infinitive and verb forms of &quot;to be&quot; from their vocabulary, whereas a second group continued to use &quot;I am,&quot; &quot;You are,&quot; &quot;They are&quot; statements as usual. For example, instead of saying, &quot;I am depressed,&quot; a student was asked to eliminate that emotionally primed verb and to say something else, such as, &quot;I feel depressed when ...&quot; or &quot;I tend to make myself depressed about …”&quot; </em></p><p>###</p><p>Back to hunger. </p><p>Re: hunger, there’s no there there.</p><p>We perceive hunger rather than <em>are</em> hunger.</p><p>Generalizing a bit, among the daily chores for staying alive as a human include eating, drinking, sleeping, etc.</p><p>But we don’t typically think or say, “I perceive hunger” and then to choose to eat, nor “I assess my adenosine levels are high” and then choose to sleep.</p><p>Nope.</p><p>Rather —</p><p>I am hungry.</p><p>I am tired.</p><p>###</p><p>The first sentence that occurred to me while lazing about with my book was, “We’re not regulating our bodies — we’re regulating our perception.”</p><p>It’s even more clear when looking at it from the opposite point of view — non-food substances that increase or decrease perceived hunger.</p><p>Ephedrine hydrochloride, especially when mixed with caffeine, is often used by bodybuilders to increase metabolic rate; i.e., it helps you burn fat by metabolizing it. Ephedrine gives you increased capacity for power generation and increased metabolization at the potential downside of increased thermogenesis (it makes you very warm - actually, this is useful in winter but a hassle otherwise) and it taxes one’s heart when consumed, which is the largest downside.</p><p>Notably though, ephedrine is also an appetite suppressant. With the same blood sugar, ghrelin, stomach contents, etc etc — whilst taking ephedrine, you’ll typically feel less hungry.</p><p>So you’ll probably eat less.</p><p>The chain reaction from ephedrine does a lot of things biochemically, but it also <em>changes one’s perception of hunger</em> — or the lack thereof<em>.</em></p><p><em>###</em></p><p>I was feeling well-pleased with myself at this point, ready to plant a flag in the ground and and make triumphant declarations.</p><p>But then I think, “Well, hold on a minute, is there any time we consume food when we’re not regulating perception?”</p><p>The first example of that might be some social setting — a case where you’re not hungry, but it might be rude to decline food. </p><p>I thought about it more, and said, no, this is the same thing — it’s consuming food in response to a perception that it’d be rude not to. Social cues and social settings are probably more complex modes of thought and perception, but it’s still perceived.</p><p>“It would <strong>be rude</strong> of me not to eat here.”</p><p>I’d contend that, most of the time, that’s still regulating perception. Not the perception of hunger, but the perception of social decorum, or the perception of appropriate behavior, or something like that.</p><p>Still though, most of the time, regulating perception.</p><p>###</p><p>But then an actual counterexample came to mind — what about a person who puts together a detailed nutrition and meal plan, either to gain weight or lose weight, along with detailed recipes and meals to be consumed at certain times each day?</p><p>If someone pre-cooks a week’s worth of healthy food, and pre-commits to eating it at certain times, and to not skip those meals even if they’re not hungry, and to not have extra food that’s off the plan even if they’re hungry — this seems like something else entirely, does it not?</p><p>###</p><p>Someone more well-versed than me could weigh in on the relevant neuroscience — I’d imagine that detailed planning of nutritional consumption over time would include much more use of the neocortex than the limbic system.</p><p>But neuroscience and brain regions aside, it seems to me that moving off “I am hungry” offers some great possibility for better health, wellness, and control over one’s life.</p><p>The default inclination seems to be,</p><p>1. Some perception occurs to us. (Hunger, let’s say.)</p><p>2. Uncritically, we think, “I am hungry.”</p><p>3. We eat.</p><p>Whereas, with a bit of foresight, we might do this —</p><p>1. Do some research to figure out what nutrition and life patterns we’d like to live.</p><p>2. Get those plans to the right mix of optimal for health and sustainable.</p><p>3.

Unfortunately it has not sparked much discussion. However I sincerely believe this idea is the key to paradoxes related to anthropic reasoning. So I’m making this post hoping to raise more attention. Feedbacks are very welcome.</p>
<p><strong>1. What is it about.</strong></p>
<p>To summarize my entire argument in one sentence: reasonings from different perspectives should not mix.</p>
<p>If I say ""I'm a man"" then it is definitely true and meaningful as the body most immediate to my perception is of a human male. To my wife the same statement is obviously false since she is a woman. It is rather trivial if ""I"" is defined by my first-person perspective's center then the statement may not be valid once switched to someone else's perspective. Of course in real life if I say ""I'm a man"" my wife would (hopefully) agree. She maybe interpreting the sentence as ""My husband is a man"". However ""my husband"" is still defined by her perspective and the sentence might be invalid to others (e.g. I do not have a husband). Or we can employ a third-person's perspective and reason as an impartial outsider. The statement may become ""Dadadarren is a man."" Here ""The person named Dadadarren"" is not defined by any perspective center. Notice the name is used to specify me in third person because for an impartial outsider I am just an ordinary person like everybody else. There is no apparent ""I"" anymore. So some feature must be used to specify me among all people. My argument is that a logic framework must be fully contained within one perspective. It cannot be partially from a first-person reasoning and partially from a third-person reasoning. For example, if my perspective center is used to define ""I"" then we cannot switch to an outsider's third-person perspective just as we cannot switch to my wife's perspective. Conversely if we reason as an outsider and treat every individual as ordinary, i.e. all in the same reference class, then my first-person perspective’s center cannot be used to define a self explanatory “I”.</p>
<p>A perspective’s center defines not only “I” but also concepts such as “this”, “here” and “now”. So these words are primitively apparent to the first person. No other information is needed to explain them. Only when reasoned from another perspective do they need to be explained by features. Many anthropic arguments do not recognize this difference. So in their logic “I” sometimes refers to the primitively understood first-person center, while sometimes refers to a specific physical entity differentiated from others by some feature. Using these definitions interchangeably inevitably mixes reasoning from different perspectives. This is why many of these arguments give paradoxical conclusions.</p>
<p><strong>2. Using my own existence as evidence</strong></p>
<p>A point of contention in sleeping beauty problem is whether I have new information by waking up in the experiment. Halfers think I can only find myself awake, coupled with the existence of a guaranteed awakening, waking up in the experiment gives no new information. Thirders disagree. The notion I can only find myself awake is inconsequential. There are only two possibilities for today: either there is an awakening or not. Waking up gives the new information that there is an awakening which increases the probability of tails.</p>
<p>Both theories have intuitive appeals. From a first-person perspective it is true that I would always find myself exist. In fact by reasoning from the first-person perspective my existence is already acknowledged. In the case of sleeping beauty problem halfer is right in saying I can only find myself awake thus no new information.</p>
<p>It is also possible to reason from a third-person perspective. From a-third person perspective no one’s existence is inherently guaranteed. In the sleeping beauty problem if we reason from an outsider’s perspective then for a specific day it is possible the experiment subject would just sleep thought it. Thirders think waking up today eliminates that possibility thus is new information. Unfortunately there is a mistake. “Today” like “now” is defined by a perspective’s center. It is only meaningful if reasoned from a first-person perspective. So from the third-person perspective the information available is not the subject is awake on a specific day but rather the subject is awake on an unspecific day. I.e. there is (at least) one awakening in the experiment. This is already known from the experiment setup. The notion of new information is actually caused by mixed reasoning from two perspectives.</p>
<p><strong>3. Are double-halfers un-Bayesian?</strong></p>
<p>Basing on the coin toss result and today’s date halfers typically assigns probability as follows: P(Heads and Monday)=1/2, P(Tails and Monday)=1/4 and P(Tails and Tuesday)=1/4. However this presents a dilemma when she is told today is Monday. By ordinary bayesian update the probability of heads shall rise to 2/3. Since the coin toss can happen after the Monday wakeup I am predicting a fair coin toss yet to happen to deviate from half. The infamous Doomsday argument basically takes the same form. This is highly unpalatable. Alternatively some argue that after learning today is Monday the probability of Heads should remain at 1/2. However this seems un-bayesian. Various rules has been proposed (e.g. Halpern, Meacham, Briggs etc) to try to justify this yet all have very serious drawbacks (e.g. Titelbaum’s embarrassment for double-halfers). So the dilemma remains.</p>
<p>This is because in the context of sleeping beauty problem the probabilities of “today being Monday/Tuesday” do not exist. In another word “what’s the probability of today being Monday/Tuesday” are invalid questions. It is actually asking among the two potential awakenings which one is today’s. The generalize question in anthropic reasoning would be “among all entities in my reference class which one is me?”. These questions mix first and third-person reasoning. At one hand the reference class is only applicable from a third-person perspective while at the other hand it is using my perspective center to specify a self-explanatory “today” or “me”. They are essentially asking from a third-person perspective which one is my first-person perspective center. Such questions/probabilities are therefore invalid. Because these probabilities do not exist in the first place there is no Bayesian update to be performed upon learning today is Monday.</p>
<p><strong>4. Is there a discrepancy between Bayesian and Frequentist probability?</strong></p>
<p>One often seen argument is to repeat the sleeping beauty experiment multiple times. In the long run about 2/3 of the awakenings would be after Tails and 1/3 after Heads. This suggest the frequentist probability of Heads should be 1/3. Halfers are actually arguing the Bayesian and Frequentist probabilities being different. Such a notion is mistaken, once again, due to the mixing of perspectives.</p>
<p>Let’s take a first-person perspective of the experiment subject. For the ease of narratives consider this experiment. (Don’t worry I will get back to sleeping beauty problem momentarily.) When you go to sleep tonight a fair coin would be tossed. Depending on how it falls a highly accurate clone of you may be created and be put into an identical room. So when you wake up there is no way of knowing if you are old or new. Suppose you have fall asleep and wake up in the experiment, i.e. experienced a iteration of the experiment. Now from your first-person perspective what would a repetition of this experiment be like? Quite obviously it would be you going to sleep once more, with another coin toss and potential cloning, and wake up again. This process can be repeated many times up to infinity. Among these repetitions half of them would be Heads. Of course if there exist another copy of you he may go through the same procedure since for outsiders there is no reason to treat you two differently. But that does not concern you so it is irrelevant from a first-person perspective.</p>
<p>Based on the same reasoning the repetitions in the sleeping beauty problem should take the following form. In the first experiment the two potential awakenings are 24 hours apart. After waking up from the first experiment I shall enter another repetition with two potential awakenings 12 hours apart. Another repetition would be 6 hours apart and so on. (this assumes the time taken for actual waking and interviewing is zero for the easy of description etc.) In another word repeating the sleeping beauty experiment from the first-person perspective is a supertask which can be repeated up to infinity within 24 hours. Obviously half of those awakenings would be after Heads and the other half following Tails.</p>
<p>The above process describes first-person perspective. Third-person perspective is way less complicated. For an outsider the identity of the experiment participant, both before and after the memory wipe, are irrelevant. So experiments performed on different people through different times are all considered repetitions. As an outsider the number of repetitions is simply the number of experiments performed. Among which half of the experiments would have Heads tosses and the other half Tails.</p>
<p>From participant’s first-person perspective the frequency can be accounted by the number of awakenings. At the same time only experiments he subjectively experienced are counted as repetitions. Whereas from an outsider’s third-person perspective the frequency shall be accounted by experiments performed. Yet any experiment on any participants are considered repetitions. Only if we mix the two by account the frequency by awakenings and count all experiments performed on different people as repetitions do we get the frequency of Heads as 1/3. This is again a mix of perspectives.</p>
<p>On a side note since many arguments are based on bets and their respective rewards. These rewards should also follow decision maker’s perspective. Meaning when a participant is duplicated his money shall be duplicated as well. Only then would her decision reflect the probability.</p>
<p><strong>5. Is perspective disagreement unreasonable?</strong></p>
<p>John Pittard (2015) pointed out any halfer must affirm robust perspectivism. That is two people in direct communication can give different probabilities. This has been used by some as a counter to halferism. To see this disagreement consider the following example. (Pittard actually used a slightly more complicated example in his paper. However the explanation presented here is applicable to both cases. ) Just like in the previous example when you fall asleep you might be cloned if a coin toss resulted in Tails. The two of you would be put into identical rooms. If the coin fell Heads one of the rooms would be empty. The clone process is highly accurate it retains memory so you have no way of knowing if you are old or new. One of your friend would randomly choose one of the two rooms to enter. Say she saw you in the room. What’s her probability of Heads? What is your answer?</p>
<p>For your friend the question is non-anthropic so it is very easy. If the coin fell Heads one of the room would be empty. If the coin fell Tails then you would be cloned and both rooms would be occupied. Since the room chosen is occupied it is new evidence favouring Tails. Simple Bayesian updating would give her the probability of Heads to be 1/3. For you seeing your friend gives you no new information about the coin toss. Because it doesn’t matter if there is anyone in the other room, you would have the same probability of seeing her (1/2). Therefore whatever probability I assigned at wake up must remain. Meaning as a halfer I should assign the probability of Heads as 1/2.</p>
<p>Here the disagreement is apparent. The two of us are in direct communication and sharing all our information. Yet we are giving different probabilities to the same question. To make the situation weirder, both of us think the other’s reasoning is correct. Some may think it is highly unpalatable suggesting the probability of head cannot be anything other than 1/3.</p>
<p>The explanation for this disagreement is quite simple: we are not actually answering the same question. From my friend’s perspective the person in this room is any copy of me. If I was cloned she has no meaningful way of telling which specific one is in this room. Hence she is answering the question “what’s the probability of Heads given the chosen room is occupied (by any copy of me)”. Whereas from my first-person perspective I am defined by my perspective center. So even if there is another copy of me I am still inherently unique. I.e. nobody else is in my reference class. So I am answering the question “What is the probability of Heads given I, this person specifically, is in the chosen room” Because this specificality is purely based on the first-person perspective it is incommunicable. E.g. I can keep telling her “this is me” but it would mean nothing to her. That’s why we would remain our differences yet agree the other is also correct from his/her perspective.</p>
<p>This disagreement is also valid in the frequentists sense. Suppose I am stuck in this experiment for 1000 days. I would see my friend in about 500 days with half of those following Heads and the other half following Tails. However in these 1000 experiments she would find the room occupied 750 times. The extra 250 are the times when she saw the other copy of me following tails. Of course in reality my friend may be involved in far more repetitions than 1000. Because all the copies produced during the experiments might also want to repeat the experiment by their count. However this higher number of repetitions would not change the relative frequency for her. So the frequentist probability for the two of us are indeed different.</p>
<p><strong>6. Conclusions</strong></p>
<p>To reason in third-person perspective is to think as some outsider whose center is unrelated to the topic of interest. i.e. uncentered reasoning. First-person perspective uses its center in various aspect of logic. i.e. centered reasoning. Traditionally (e.g. David Lewis) treats centered reasoning as uncentered reasoning with additional information. That uncentered information describe the world and centered information adds my location on top of that. So uncentered reasoning can be subsumed into centered reasoning. In contrast I think they are logics from two distinct perspectives that are actually in parallel. Both centered and uncentered information describes the world just from different perspectives. Therefore the two systems should not mix. If we recognize the importance of it paradoxes in anthropic reasoning can be well explained.</p>

It&#x27;s a heavy book in more than one sense. Some parts of it I will omit (like the chapter on <em>De caelesti hierarchia</em>, curiously hard to reduce). If we persevere through antiquity alone it will be worth it, but there will be other hills to die on, could we get past Aristotle.</p><p>(It appears that many people have tried to get past Aristotle.)</p><p>To simplify, Lyubarsky had set out to trace how the concept of rank appeared and developed enough for biologists to think about, for example, &quot;genera&quot; and &quot;families&quot; as things which exist... s<em>omehow</em>... and in the process did rather more. Nowadays we take for granted the ability to discuss nested concepts, but it had to be invented. (And it was developed by titans making progress, ridiculous assumptions, leaps of logic and fortuitous mistakes.) It seems strange to me that in the whole LW corpus so little attention is paid to the way we root and propagate ideas, as opposed to assigning weight to some of them and not the others. We agree that non-apples should not be sold, but that how should one recognize a comparison of &quot;apples&quot; and &quot;citruces&quot;? There are cases where it makes sense, and cases where it doesn&#x27;t.</p><p>I get that it is not a practical thing to do when people think in real time, but a classification is a narration, and we don&#x27;t have one. Will it take us a thousand years?</p><p>So, biological systematics. &quot;In this discipline there is direct creation of objects of scientific knowledge; their borders and procedures of change are discussed, as well as degrees of trueness (veridicality?) and ways to arrange them into a united image of the world&quot;. It is built on ranks, but in a backwards way, &quot;there is a built hierarchy of taxa, and one can put forward hypotheses about which trait to consider the hierarchyzing one. Perhaps it is similarity? Or kinship? The only real rule which upholds the hierarchy is ranking. There is a nomenclature rule which forbids dividing an Order directly into genera; an Order necessarily consists of families. &quot; </p><p>---</p><p>...it might be a silly thing to try to take from biology, but it&#x27;s also one I can afford.</p><p>---------</p><p>That should take an hour, and then we shall talk about other things.</p><p></p>",,mary-chernyshenko,mary-chernyshenko,Mary Chernyshenko

Take with at least 500 grams of salt.</em></p><p>I don&#x27;t like wearing bike helmets, and have a bunch of friends who were horrified at me not wearing helmets when I occasionally ride a bicycle. On their request, here is a rough cost-benefit analysis of riding a bike without a helmet to my office and back (a total of ~20 minutes):</p><p>I decided to break down the question into the following three subquestions: </p><ul><li>How great are the benefits from exercise when riding a bike?</li><li>What is the baseline risk of riding a bicycle?</li><li>How elevated is the risk by not wearing a bicycle helmet? </li></ul><h2>How great are the benefits from exercise when riding a bike? </h2><p><u><a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/2zx61c/on_micromorts_cycling_and_risk/"">https://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/2zx61c/on_micromorts_cycling_and_risk/</a></u> </p><blockquote>According to the first episode of More of Less (haven&#x27;t gotten to the second one yet), the benefits of cycling outweigh the risks by about 5-10 times.</blockquote><p><u><a href=""https://www.bikeforums.net/commuting/896396-risk-analysis-micromort-microlife.html"">https://www.bikeforums.net/commuting/896396-risk-analysis-micromort-microlife.html</a></u> </p><blockquote> Micromorts are a unit of risk measuring a one-in-a-million probability of death. You can say that a mode of transport results in so many miles per micromort and the result is a number you can really use. For cycling, this is 10-20 miles, for driving it is about 230 miles.</blockquote><blockquote>Microlifes are a millionth of an (average remaining) lifespan = 30mins of life, so activities which extend your life or decrease it in a chronic rather than acute way can be measured.</blockquote><blockquote>In looking at the risk associated with cycling to work, people often quote the mort factor You also have to include the life factor. First 20mins of excercise = +2 microlifes . Sedentary behaviour = -1 microlife</blockquote><p><u><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microlife"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microlife</a></u></p><blockquote>First 20 minutes of moderate exercise: 2 microlifes</blockquote><blockquote>Subsequent 40 minutes of moderate exercise: 1 microlife</blockquote><p>However, this is more complicated by the other costs of wearing a helmet, as well as a preference of mine to not die at a particularly young age. All-cause mortality is really low in my age-range, so bicycling might be a significantly higher proportional increase for that age range, and with shorter GCR timelines I might not care super much about my long-term health, which also reduces the value of exercise (though then there are also immediate cognitive benefits of exercise beyond all-cause mortality that start taking effect immediately, which seems maybe like a sufficient counterbalancing consideration). </p><p>Concretely, if I cycle for 20 minutes every day and that is my only exercise, I gain about 2 microlives. If I have some other source of exercise, I gain more around 0.5 microlives. On average I think it&#x27;s more something around 1 microlive for the 20 minutes of cycling. So let&#x27;s go with that number for now.</p><h2>What is the baseline risk of riding a bicycle?</h2><p><u><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micromort"">Wikipedia for one micromort</a></u>: Travelling 10 miles (16 km) (or 20 miles (32 km)) by bicycle (accident)</p><p>Average bicycle speed (Wikipedia): 15.5 km/h</p><p><strong>Micromorts per hour of cycling (baseline): ~1</strong></p><p>That results in about a gain of a third of a micromort over 20 minutes of cycling.</p><h2>How elevated is the risk by not wearing a bicycle helmet? </h2><p><u><a href=""https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15389588.2017.1298748?journalCode=gcpi20"">https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15389588.2017.1298748?journalCode=gcpi20</a></u></p><blockquote> Results: Estimates of helmet effectiveness were similar from odds ratios (ORs) using hospital controls or from relative risks (RRs) using helmet use estimates (Seattle: OR = 0.339, RR = 0.444; Victoria: OR = 0.500, RR = 0.353). Additionally, the odds ratios using hospital controls were similar when controls were taken from a larger cohort for head injury of any severity (Seattle: OR = 0.250, alt OR = 0.257; NSW: OR = 0.446, alt OR = 0.411) and for serious head injury (Seattle: OR = 0.135, alt OR = 0.139; NSW: OR = 0.335, alt OR = 0.308). Although relevant exposure data were unavailable for The Netherlands, the odds ratio for helmet effectiveness of those using racing, mountain, or hybrid bikes was similar to other estimates (OR = 0.371).</blockquote><p>Ok, so if we assume that all micromorts come from head injuries, then this suggest a reduction of around 2/3 in risk. </p><p><u><a href=""https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/46/1/278/2617198"">https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/46/1/278/2617198</a></u> </p><blockquote>Results: A total of 43 studies met inclusion criteria and 40 studies were included in the meta-analysis with data from over 64 000 injured cyclists. For cyclists involved in a crash or fall, helmet use was associated with odds reductions for head (OR = 0.49, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.42–0.57), serious head (OR = 0.31, 95% CI: 0.25–0.37), face (OR = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.56–0.81) and fatal head injury (OR = 0.35, 95% CI: 0.14–0.88). No clear evidence of an association between helmet use and neck injury was found (OR = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.74–1.25). There was no evidence of time trends or publication bias.</blockquote><p>Ok, so this also suggest something around the 2/3 number, so I think that’s a pretty decent bet. </p><p>For arguments sake, let&#x27;s just assume that all of the bad consequences of accidents are covered by measuring head-injuries, resulting in a total risk increase by a factor of 3. </p><h2>Conclusion (very sketchy)</h2><p>Ok, so if you add this up super naively in terms of micromorts, then we get a (1/3) * 3 = 1 micromort loss at a 1 microlife gain for my average office commute. If we commit a statistical atrocity and just add those up naively, we end up with a net gain of 0, suggesting that cycling without a helmet is roughly equally risky as doing some random sedentary activity. </p><p>There are obviously a lot of complicating factors to this, but I am not sure in which direction they point. I care more about short-term injury risk than I care about long-term gain from exercise, but I also care about the cognitive benefits of exercise and want to maximize my peak-potential more than my average potential. </p><p>I also know that you can’t just add micromorts to microlifes together, though it seems hard to figure out what the correct thing to do is, and I only set aside around an hour of time for this. </p><p>Overall, my conclusion is that if I have the choice between riding my bike without a helmet, and staying at home, I should probably be mostly indifferent between the two. Since the alternative is usually paying for an Uber to my office, or walking, or riding with a helmet which I find quite actively annoying, I think I will continue riding without a helmet for now, in the absence of me noticing some new considerations or evidence (or discovering some way to be less annoyed by helmets).  </p><p>Or maybe someone feels motivated and does a better analysis than I did here and corrects me. My overall estimate on the importance of this isn&#x27;t super high, so I probably won&#x27;t do much more analysis of it.</p>",,habryka4,habryka4,habryka

Instead they stay focused on the explanation (and exploration) of ideas.</li><li>They avoid particular hotbutton issues that are likely to spawn<a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/BZtAavpsy9WtMYgEL/demon-threads""> demon threads</a>.</li><li>They avoid discussion of the site itself, and the surrounding community.</li></ul><p>The main benefit a post has for being frontpage is that more users will see it by default (where as personal blogposts require you to actively turn on a setting to display them).</p><p>There are two problems with the name ""frontpage"":</p><p><strong>1. It's confusing. </strong>Since you <em>can</em> display personal blogposts on the literal site frontpage (and there are contexts <em>other</em> than the literal frontpage where you might want to see ""frontpage"" posts, such as on the allposts page), it's a bit weird to use that word to convey a bunch of criteria.</p><p><strong>2. It's a little too harsh-seeming to not get promoted to frontpage.<em> </em></strong>I don't ""frontpage"" should mean ""everything that's good and virtuous to talk about."" I do think that's it good to err on the side of writing posts that meet the frontpage criteria, but I think of this as a default rather than the obviously-correct-way-everything-should-be.</p><p>This post explores what frontpage is trying to do, ways in which we might modify it, but ultimately (for now), answering the question of ""what can we change the frontpage name to, to locally improve the current situation.""</p><hr class=""dividerBlock""><h1>What is ""Frontpage"" Trying to Do?</h1><p>Some value I think the ""frontpage mechanic"" provides include:</p><p><strong>1. Disincentivze discourse that is more stressful or time wasting than it needs to be. </strong></p><p><strong>2. Retain LessWrong's strong foundation of epistemic clarity. </strong></p><p>Rationality is harder when a discussion will directly impact your social landscape. Social coordination is important, but I want <em>the default</em> for LessWrong to be a place where you ""only"" have to think clearly about ideas, instead of ""thinking about clear ideas in hard mode where you're tempted to round things off in directions that improve your political position.""</p><p><strong>3. Provide good ""seed culture"" (or ""training data"") for new users. </strong></p><p>When you show up on LW, the first thing you see is a bunch of discussion of ideas. This tells you roughly what sort of things the LW community care about. Whereas if the first thing you saw as a bunch of discussion about community/meta stuff, there's a decent chance of two outcomes.</p><ul><li>Thinking ""hmm, this is a navel gazing community that's mostly focused on itself. What is this community even a<em>bout?"" </em>and then bouncing off.</li><li>Thinking ""ah! rationalist community!"" and getting excited without actually understanding what we mean by rationalist, or understanding a lot of the nuances that actually drive the heart of the community. </li></ul><p><strong>4. Relatedly: Somewhat disincentivize community-for-community-sake stuff.</strong></p><p>Even among longterm members, community stuff seems to get 2-4 times as much attention as it should.</p><p>Community-qua-community stuff often feels like it requires less background knowledge to get started on (as compared to, say, developing a new decision theory, or figuring out the best evidence for a given diet). It feels more accessible.</p><p>But I'm much more interested in community-oriented contributions by people who have demonstrated a clear understanding of the underlying goals and thought processes of LessWrong. </p><p>And even among those people, I'd rather that community-oriented ideas and projects <em>come about organically</em> as people actually try to think about a hard, object-level problem. </p><p>Instead of starting by thinking ""how can I improve the community?"" think ""what am I curious about or excited by?"". Then, if it turns out that you're facing a bottleneck that is community related, work on fixing that bottleneck in the context of your curiosity/excitement.</p><p><strong>5. Avoiding creating an adversarial/marketing relationship between readers and the LessWrong site.</strong></p><p>A <em>lot</em> of stuff on the internet is written with the intent to get me interested in a product. Facebook turned out to be a useful marketing tool, and now a lot of content (not just the overt advertisements) are there with a goal of maintaining my attention, to later convert that attention into a resource.</p><p>Eliezer very rarely mentions his organization in the LW sequences. Instead, the focus is almost entirely on actually learning rationality skills. He does have ulterior motives, but <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/SqNvmwDxRibLXjMZN/and-say-no-more-of-it"">one of the more interesting posts</a> IMO is the one where he spells out the ulterior motives and notes <em>how crucial it is</em> for the ulterior motives not to poison the integrity of the rationality project.</p><p>I'm less worried about this than habryka is, but there's definitely a failure mode where a lot of the LW content ends up being organizational announcements and pitches for money or social momentum, and that ends up making it harder to show up and think and learn.</p><hr class=""dividerBlock""><h1>Improving the Frontpage paradigm?</h1><p>The frontpage criteria I'm most worried about is the ""no organizational announcements/pitches"" thing. This is particularly because a fledgling organization needs resources, and, well, it actually matters that they get attention. </p><p>LessWrong is a place for thinking, but I'm still most excited when that thinking gets applied into action.</p><p>Point #5 above still seems important, but I think we can probably improve on it.</p><p>Two clusters of solutions include:</p><ul><li>Working harder to get people to login to LessWrong (they only need to do it once per device), so that their frontpage settings get saved, and if they prefer to see personal blogposts they can just do so. And, after users have been using the site awhile, if they haven't toggled personal blogposts on, they can get a reminder that this is an option.</li><li>Creating a more nuanced paradigm, where instead of a single ""frontpage"" place that posts can be promoted to, there are (say), three sections. We've been considering something like:</li><ul><li><strong>Science/Journal/Inquiry – </strong>essentially what frontpage is now, where the focus is on ideas, explanations, models and curiosity. I'm not quite sure what to call this.</li><li><strong>Art</strong> –&nbsp;there's been a lot of good rationalist fiction, and we've been considering more actively encouraging that (while giving it a dedicated space that is more optimized around it). </li><li><strong>Coordination</strong> –&nbsp;a more dedicated space for building momentum for projects, events, and resolving important disagreements about norms. We've been putting this section off not because it's not important but because it seems quite hard and risks harming the epistemic foundation.</li></ul></ul><p>I'm also interested in having frontpage/science/journal/inquiry or whatever, help point people in a direction of how to build their ideas over time.</p><p>My current guess is that the frontpage section should feel sort of like a laboratory workshop, or perhaps the cafeteria at Bell Labs, where people talk about their ideas and models. The atmosphere is casual but grounded in intellectual rigor.</p><p>Ideas that seem particularly good or interested get curated.</p><p>Ideas that, several months later, have withstood a lot of scrutiny and proven useful, are incentivized to get rewritten, distilled, clarified, and ultimately pass some kind of <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/rCzXcyM9Gt2pxmhcE/musings-on-lesswrong-peer-review"">review bar or become ""canon.""</a></p><h1>Renaming ""Frontpage""</h1><p>The solutions I listed above involve a lot of technical work (as well as some social and philosophical work). But, it seems like some significant improvements could come just from giving frontpage a more accurate and specific name.</p><p>The ideal name:</p><ul><li>Doesn't confuse ""location"" of the site (such as the home page) for a particular style of content</li><li>Emphasizes ideas over people and social momentum.</li><li>Hints at being the beginning (but not the end) of high quality truthseeking process</li><li>Indicates that this is one particular place where posts can go, without feeling intrinsically like the <em>only</em> place that quality posts go.</li></ul>",,Raemon,raemon,Raemon

You may notice that you are reading a document.</p><p>This fact comes with certain implications.  For instance, why are you reading this?  Will you finish it?  What decisions will you come to as a result?  What will you do next?</p><p>Notice that, whatever you end up doing, it’s likely that there are dozens or even hundreds of other people, quite similar to you and in quite similar positions, who will follow reasoning which strongly resembles yours, and make choices which correspondingly match.</p><p>Given that, it’s our recommendation that you make your next few decisions by asking the question “What policy, if followed by all agents similar to me, would result in the most good, and what does that policy suggest in my particular case?”  It’s less of a question of trying to decide for all agents sufficiently-similar-to-you (which might cause you to make the wrong choice out of guilt or pressure) and more something like “if I <em>were</em> in charge of all agents in my reference class, how would I treat instances of that class with <em>my</em> <em>specific characteristics?</em>”</p><p>If that kind of thinking leads you to read further, great.  If it leads you to set up a MIRIx chapter, even better.  In the meantime, we will proceed as if the only people reading this document are those who justifiably expect to find it reasonably useful.</p><p> ⠀ </p><h2>Preamble II: Surface Area</h2><p>Imagine that you have been tasked with moving a cube of solid iron that is one meter on a side.  Given that such a cube weighs ~16000 pounds, and that an average human can lift ~100 pounds, a naïve estimation tells you that you can solve this problem with ~150 willing friends.</p><p>But of course, a meter cube can fit at most something like 10 people around it.  It doesn’t <em>matter</em> if you have the theoretical power to move the cube if you can’t bring that power to bear in an effective manner.  The problem is constrained by its <em>surface area.</em></p><p>MIRIx chapters are one of the best ways to increase the surface area of people thinking about and working on the technical problem of AI alignment.  And just as it would be a bad idea to decree &quot;the 10 people who happen to currently be closest to the metal cube are the only ones allowed to think about how to think about this problem&quot;, we don’t want MIRI to become the bottleneck or authority on what kinds of thinking can and should be done in the realm of <u><a href=""https://intelligence.org/2018/10/29/embedded-agents/"">embedded agency</a></u> and other relevant fields of research.</p><p>The hope is that you and others like you will <em>help actually solve the problem</em>, not just follow directions or read what’s already been written.  This document is designed to support people who are interested in doing real groundbreaking research themselves.</p><p> ⠀ </p><h2><strong><u>Contents</u></strong></h2><ol><li>You and your research</li><li>Logistics of getting started</li><li>Models of social dynamics</li><li>Other useful thoughts and questions</li></ol><p> ⠀ </p><h2>1. You and your research</h2><p>We sometimes hear questions of the form “Even a summer internship feels too short to make meaningful progress on real problems.  How can anyone expect to meet and do real research in a single afternoon?”</p><p>There’s a Zeno-esque sense in which you can’t make research progress in a million years if you can’t also do it in five minutes.  It’s easy to fall into a trap of (either implicitly or explicitly) conceptualizing “research” as “first studying and learning what’s already been figured out, and then attempting to push the boundaries and contribute new content.”</p><p>The problem with this frame (according to us) is that it leads people to <em>optimize</em> for absorbing information, rather than seeking it instrumentally, as a <em>precursor to understanding.</em>  (Be mindful of what you’re optimizing in your research!)</p><p>There’s always going to be more pre-existing, learnable content out there.  It’s hard to predict, in advance, how much you need to know before you’re qualified to do your own original thinking and seeing, and it’s easy to <u><a href=""https://equilibriabook.com/toc/"">Dunning-Kruger or impostor-syndrome</a></u> yourself into endless hesitation or an over-reliance on existing authority.</p><p>Instead, we recommend throwing out the whole question of authority.  Just follow the threads that feel alive and interesting.  Don’t think of research as “study, then contribute.”  Focus on your own understanding, and let the questions themselves determine how often you need to go back and read papers or study proofs.</p><p>Approaching research with that attitude makes the question “How can meaningful research be done in an afternoon?” dissolve.  Meaningful progress seems very difficult if you try to measure yourself by objective external metrics.  It is much easier when your own taste drives you forward.</p><p>No procedure for doing research will fit for everyone.  However, what follows are steps which you can try either on your own or in a group setting (such as MIRIx) in order to practice the kind of curiosity-driven research just described.</p><p> ⠀ </p><p>1.  <strong>Write a list of questions.</strong></p><ul><li>If you are doing this as a group, put the list on a whiteboard or other place where everyone can see.</li><li>Focus on what <em>you</em> don’t know how to do, or what <em>you</em> feel confused about.</li><li>If no questions come to mind, say to yourself (or the group), “excellent, I must know how to solve the whole problem” and try to give details of the solution until you get stuck.</li><li>It’s also OK for things on the list to be ideas you’d like to develop further, or thoughts you’d like the group to critique, rather than questions.</li></ul><p> ⠀ </p><p>2.  <strong>Choose one of the questions to focus on, based on what feels most interesting.</strong></p><ul><li>If you are in a group of more than three people, consider splitting the group up.  Each group can discuss its own question, or have parallel discussions on the same overall question.  Agree on a time to come back together and discuss what you thought about.</li><li>It can be good to keep the whole list of questions somewhere visible, so that you have a reminder of other interesting topics to switch to if thoughts peter out on the question originally chosen.</li></ul><p> ⠀ </p><p>3.  <strong>Clarify your curiosity.  What is desired?  What do you think might be possible?</strong></p><ul><li>In a group, usually the person who proposed a topic will have some things to say in order to get everyone on the same page.</li><li>Working on your own, it can be useful to just start writing down everything you think you know, and what you think you don’t know.  Write down anything potentially relevant which comes to mind. Don’t worry initially about whether your claims are true or whether your questions are meaningful.  Then, go back and try to make sense of it.  Try to formalize your claims and questions until they turn into something which is definitely either true or false.</li></ul><p> ⠀ </p><p>4.  <strong>Keep clarifying.</strong></p><ul><li>Keep stating sub-questions and making claims which may or may not be true, starting informally and working towards formal rigor.</li><li>Notice where your curiosity waxes and wanes, and avoid dutiful completeness.  Look for the simplest possible cases that you are still confused about, and try to work through them.</li><li>Allow yourself to get sidetracked.  Allow yourself to play.  So long as everyone in the discussion is curious and engaged, it’s working to build understanding.  Be open to getting nerd-sniped by “irrelevant” math questions; they may eventually turn out to be more relevant than they seem.  You’re building your own capability, even if it isn’t directly useful to the problem you’re working on.</li><li>If you do arrive at a concrete mathematical result which captures something interesting, or even a concrete mathematical question, write it up properly.  A good write-up often adds a lot to your own understanding, besides the value of communicating your ideas to others.</li></ul><p> ⠀ </p><p>This resembles how much of the progress at MIRI happens.  It’s very different from the attractor of “just read lots of papers,” and it’s very different from the attractor of “try to figure out top-down what the field as a whole needs.”</p><p>An easy mistake is to think of yourself as trying to contribute to the world&#x27;s collective knowledge, and thereby neglecting to prioritize <em>your own</em> knowledge and understanding.  &quot;Just read papers&quot; may <em>sound</em> like it&#x27;s prioritizing your own knowledge, but it often reflects a mindset that’s tacitly assuming that others know exactly what you need to know.  &quot;Optimize for your own understanding&quot; is a mindset with a faster feedback loop.</p><p>There’s nothing inherently wrong with reading papers—even if it’s just because they’re in the field and you want a broad overview of the field.  But throughout, you should be trying to form a picture of what you personally do and don&#x27;t know how to do, and what you’d need to know how to do in order to solve the problem.  That’s hard, and maybe you’re sure that the first five ideas you write down will be wrong.  Still, write them down anyway, and try to get them to work, so you can see what happens and discover what goes wrong.</p><p>We don’t want a hundred bright minds all asking the exact same questions, and taking the exact same set of assumptions.  We want a field full of explorers, not exploiters.  Put another way, the best way to become a researcher is to practice the skill of independent thought right from the beginning, rather than exercising your “sit back and absorb information for its own sake” muscles.</p><p>So don&#x27;t ask &quot;What are the open questions in this field?&quot; Ask: &quot;What are <em>my</em> questions in this field?&quot;</p><p> ⠀ </p><h2>2. Logistics of getting started</h2><p>Let’s say you’ve tried some things that resemble the above, you enjoyed them, and you want to move forward on starting your own MIRIx chapter.</p><p>Our first recommendation is that you find ONE or TWO other people (not three+), and try doing research together once or a few times.  There’s more detail below in the social dynamics section about how exactly that might look, but the idea is that you want to establish a tone and flow with a small number of people first.  Negotiating a direction for the group tends to be much harder if you start with a larger number of people.</p><p>Another important choice which can be difficult to negotiate with a large number of people is schedule.  Finding a time and place which is good for everyone can become intractable, and changing it meeting to meeting to try to make it work for everyone can be de-motivating.  Choose a schedule which is good for the founding core of the group.  What day of the week is good for you?  How often do you want to meet?  How long do you want meetings to be?  We recommend meetings be monthly, weekly, or every other week.  Meeting length can be anywhere from an hour to a whole day, depending on what makes sense for you.</p><p>Once you find a partner or two that you genuinely enjoy making progress with, your next step is to plan and advertise for a first large meetup (where “large” means something like “three to six new people” and definitely doesn’t mean “twenty or thirty attendees”).</p><p>Try to find a venue that is private and sound-isolated, has flat surfaces and comfortable seating, and has whiteboards on the walls.  Universities often have spaces like this, as do public libraries, but someone’s living room is fine if you can minimize the number of intrusions and interruptions.  If you can’t find a space with whiteboards, look for easels and easel pads, and in either case be sure to bring your own markers.  Also bring along spare paper, pens, and clipboards, and assign someone to make sure that there are snacks and drinks.</p><p>(A note about snacks and drinks: people almost <em>always</em> underestimate the importance of the quality and quantity of food, anchoring on something like “I dunno, maybe just spend ten bucks on some chips or something?”  Instead, ask yourself: what dollar value would I put on a 15% increase in the group’s ability to think, overall mood, and ultimate satisfaction with the event?  That’s how much you should consider spending (/ <u><a href=""https://intelligence.org/mirix/"">asking MIRI to spend</a></u>) on snacks, especially for the first meeting.  Don’t buy only junk food.  It may give you more energy temporarily, but it will make you worse at thinking later.  So, especially for longer meetings, healthy snacks are critical.  Longer meetings should also include a meal, perhaps at a nearby restaurant.  This also serves as a good break.)</p><p>At that first large meeting, you’ll want to start by formally electing a president.  This is an important piece of common-knowledge culture—many times, the president won’t do much, but it’s extremely useful to have a single person with the moral authority to set agendas, choose between various good options, and keep the group on track.  You may also end up electing a secretary/record-keeper, or possibly a coordinator to handle venue and food, or other offices (or you could do this after a few meetings).</p><p>Next, you’ll want to model the process that has already been working for you.  Perhaps this means sharing a list of pre-existing questions, and seeing which capture the interest of your participants.  Perhaps it means discussing the broader thrust of your research thus far before brainstorming some topics.  Regardless, you’ll want to get down to actual thinking, writing, proving, and discussing as soon as you can.  Breaking into smaller groups is often helpful if more than four people are at a meeting.  If you do this, schedule a time to come back and share ideas.</p><p>Try to include breaks in your structure to keep everyone fresh.  It can be difficult to remember to take a break when things get going, so it’s worth setting the intention ahead of time.  Short breaks every hour in which people get up and walk around are very helpful.</p><p>It can be helpful to keep a public list (on a whiteboard or shared Google doc) of questions you have, needed concepts, and promising ideas.  This is an easy source of new topics if a conversation runs dry.</p><p>One possible structure incorporating the above advice and the research procedure from the previous section:</p><ol><li>At the beginning of each meeting, everyone lists questions/topics/confusions, which are written on a public list.</li><li>People make bids to start groups on topics they’re excited about, and split off.</li><li>Groups talk for 45 minutes.</li><li>Everyone re-gathers, and discusses what happened in the smaller groups for a few minutes.</li><li>Five or ten minute break, depending on how people are feeling.</li><li>New questions/ideas are added to the board, and the process repeats as desired.  (If you plan to do several cycles, also include a longer break such as a meal somewhere.)</li></ol><p>At the end of the meeting, schedule the next event.  You may have settled on a rough schedule which works for the core of the group, but you’ll still be adjusting it meeting-to-meeting to account for holidays and other absences.  Confirming the next meeting time with everyone present is also important for attendance, even if the meeting times are set in stone.  Make sure to establish at the outset that you’re not going to try to optimize for everyone’s availability at once; it’s good to have meetups that people feel okay skipping from time to time, as long as there’s something like 70-90% consistency in the group.  If one or two people can’t make it to the second meeting, be sure to get information from them so that you can prioritize their schedules a little more when planning the third.</p><p> ⠀ </p><h2>3. Models of social dynamics</h2><p>What follows are some half-baked, ad-hoc models of what makes for a good research group, or a good collaborative enterprise in general.  You should consider all of the following to be true in spirit but false in detail, and should try to derive your own value rather than treating these as actual suggestions to follow.</p><p> ⠀ </p><p><strong>3A. Transmitters and receivers</strong></p><p>We’ve found in our own research that conversations tend to go better when they are primarily between two people.  This is not to say that you shouldn’t have three or more people <em>involved</em> in the conversation, but in any given five-minute span of time, there should mostly be just two people talking—one who is currently trying to convey something, and another who is trying to understand (and whose understanding the first is specifically optimizing for; discussing a topic at a level such that four or five different people can all follow everything is usually worse on net).</p><p>Call these two roles the “transmitter” and the “receiver.”  Things you might transmit:</p><ul><li>A specific question or confusion</li><li>A model or chain of reasoning</li><li>A piece of relevant background information that needs to be deeply understood in order for the conversation to proceed</li></ul><p>Things the receiver might do:</p><ul><li>Mirror back to the transmitter what the transmitter just said, in different words. This lets the transmitter check where the transmission has succeeded or failed.</li><li>Take notes on a whiteboard, or attempt to draw diagrams, and have the transmitter verify or correct them.  Do this as formally as you can.  Try to write down statements in logic and turn informal arguments into proofs.  Type theory is good for this kind of receiving; just writing down precise data types corresponding to what’s being discussed can be very helpful.</li><li>Resist the impulse to round off what the transmitter is saying to something you already understand.  A good way to guard against this: attempt to find at least two interpretations, and ask questions which differentiate between them. </li><li>Hold tight to the assumption that the thing the transmitter is trying to convey is interesting.  Avoid “critic” mode that will tend to make it harder for the transmitter to think and express freely.  Even if there is a fatal flaw in what the transmitter is explicitly saying, your job is to help them dig up the spark of intuition which made them go down that path, so that they can turn it into a useful idea if possible.</li><li>Stay closely in touch with confusion, and speak up where things don’t seem to make sense.  Ask clarifying questions.  Your job as receiver isn’t to just nod along or make the transmitter feel understood.  Be gentle when necessary to help the transmitter get in touch with what they’re trying to convey; but once they’re in touch, your job is to really get it out of them, in detail!</li><li>If the transmitter’s idea seems quite clear, the receiver can start red-teaming it, which means looking for attacks to make the approach fail.  Being the critic when an idea isn’t properly out yet blocks things up, but once there’s a firm proposal which seems to make sense, it’s open season.</li><li>Look for implications of what the transmitter is saying.  (“Ah, so then X!”; or, “Would that mean that X?”, etc.)  This serves at least three purposes.  First, it lets the transmitter know that you see why their idea would be totally awesome if it worked.  After all, you’re doing all these useful things with the idea.  This helps keep things going.  Second, it tests whether you see what they’re getting at.  Third, a totally absurd implication can suggest that you’re down a wrong track and should back up to see where you took a wrong turn.</li><li>White-hat trolling or gadfly-ing. Sometimes there’s not much doing with the transmitter (or there’s no active transmitter; no one having ideas). Play the role of a mischievous Socrates. Ask questions about seemingly basic things and try to show why nothing anybody thinks makes any sense. Or, defend an absurd position. (A troll may sometimes seem like a transmitter, but is actually a receiver.)</li></ul><p>The transmitter should feel as free as possible to just make claims, including “totally fake” claims, as long as they are keeping in touch with their intuitions; try to establish a norm where you can ask receivers to collaborate with you in uncovering the kernel of truth in what you’re saying rather than shooting down half-formed ideas because they’re still half-wrong. No matter how nonjudgemental the receivers are, it may help the transmitter to say things like “everything I’m about to say is totally wrong, but” every so often. </p><p>The transmitter should also remain in touch with their intuition and curiosity, steering the conversation to what they think is most interesting rather than trying to perform or entertain. The transmitter is under no obligation to answer the receiver’s questions; feel free to say “that’s not what I want to think about right now.”</p><p>The key idea is that the receiver is helping <em>midwife</em> what the transmitter is saying.  In that moment, it is the transmitter’s thinking that should take priority, and the receiver is acting as a sounding board, a living intuition pump, and a source of confusion and (minor) chaos.</p><p>Meanwhile, any third parties in the audience should be trying to serve as facilitators/translators.  They should be watching both the transmitter and the receiver and seeking to <em>model</em> what’s going on for those people.  Where are they missing each other, and talking past each other?  Where are they running up against confirmation bias, or the <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/sBBGxdvhKcppQWZZE/double-illusion-of-transparency"">double illusion of transparency</a></u>?  Where are they both agreeing that something makes sense without actually understanding it?</p><p>The audience members should speak up from time to time (probably less than 10% of the total words) to inject relevant thoughts or models or questions.  Sometimes, such an interjection will be the cause of a role switch, with an audience member taking on a new role as either transmitter or receiver, and one of the other parties rotating out.</p><p> ⠀ </p><p><strong>3B. High standards for membership</strong></p><p>It’s awkward to not-invite someone or to turn them away after one or two meetings, but it’s even more awkward to wreck your entire MIRIx chapter because you were too shy or too uncertain to protect it.</p><p>Have a clear distinction between “welcome to come to a meeting” and “is now a full part of the group.”  Make sure that there is a known decision-maker or set of decision-makers, and empower them to make calls by fiat, without having to justify or explain.  (If you don’t trust their judgment <em>without</em> explanation, don’t have them be part of the decision-making.)  Trust your own instincts; if you don’t feel like someone is a good match for the vibe you have going, then don’t invite them in.  Consider requiring multiple recommendations, or having an interview process.  These may seem unnecessary, but it can be difficult to turn people away, and a formal process makes it feel more fair.</p><p>Also consider having formal ethical guidelines, or a group pledge or set of commitments, which people sign at the moment that they fully join.  Make sure that any standards you set are ones you are willing to actually enforce (e.g. “you must come to half of all meetings” or “content discussed here is confidential unless otherwise stated”).</p><p> ⠀ </p><p><strong>3C. Escalating asks and rewards</strong></p><p>Consider the model of a martial arts academy.  When you first arrive, the instructors ask a few small things of you (e.g. kick this target, yell out loudly when you do so).  Soon, they <em>reward</em> you for these things with a belt and some status.</p><p>At that point, the asks escalate.  Perhaps now, as a yellow belt, you are put in charge of watching some white belts for a few minutes, and correcting their form.  In return, they are told to bow to you and call you “sir” or “ma’am.”</p><p>As time goes on, the asks increase, and the rewards increase commensurately.  This cycle fosters commitment and investment—it’s a process of slowly <em>proving</em> to the individual “if I put something into this system, I will get something out of it, and the more I put in, the more I’ll get out.”  Eventually, you will receive a black belt, and possibly be asked to join as a paid instructor or found your own branch of the school.</p><p>There is a similar dynamic in most groups and organizations.  Groups which ask little or nothing of their members do not receive loyalty in return.  Individuals feel bought-in to a group to the extent that that group allows them to tell positive or epic stories about themselves.</p><p>The same will be true of your MIRIx chapter.  Consider having some small, early asks that are the same for most newcomers (e.g., read such-and-such paper, or give a ten-minute talk on a topic of interest at your third meeting).  Try to build a pipeline of greater asks and rewards over time (e.g., on your fifth-ish meeting, we’d like you to take charge of setting the agenda and dividing up the groups).</p><p> ⠀ </p><p><strong>3D. Structure and elbow room</strong></p><p>Related to the previous, it’s important that you balance top-down and bottom-up structure in your MIRIx.  If there’s no clear sense of “how we do things,” then newcomers will flounder and have a bad time.  You want there to be a pre-existing structure that people can evaluate, to determine whether or not they feel like they fit into it.  You want the “what’s this like?” of your group to be clearly visible, right from the get-go, so that both people who <em>are</em> well-suited to it and people who <em>aren’t</em> can (for the most part) accurately self-assort.</p><p>At the same time, you don’t want that structure to feel limiting or confining in the long run.  Just as martial artists eventually earn the right to determine some of their own training and the ability to contribute to the agenda-setting and curriculum of newer students, so too do you want the “pie” of your MIRIx to grow as time goes on.  Otherwise, people will grow frustrated by their inability to bring the fullness of their own interests and priorities, and will leave to find a better context for their own growth and research.</p><p> ⠀ </p><p><strong>3E. Social norms</strong></p><p>That which is normal and accepted is that which goes unchallenged.  If there is behavior that you want to discourage, you need to make sure not only that you challenge it when it occurs, but also that you openly, vocally, and publicly support <em>others</em> who are challenging it.  It is the job of the group to ensure that someone who is following the rules/trying to do it right is <em>never alone</em> when they are in conflict with someone who isn’t.</p><p>Consider in advance, and be explicit about, things like the acceptability of interruptions or off-topic discussion.  Cultivate a culture of disagreement, but be deliberate about building in politeness and support so that disagreement is net-positive and doesn’t turn into abuse or delegitimization.  Protect whatever decision-making structures you decide to put in place, and be consistent about what constitutes each person’s domain and what marks the end of discussion.</p><p> ⠀ </p><h2>4. Other thoughts and questions</h2><ol><li>Try to have a mix of topics or activities, so that every meeting doesn’t follow the exact same pattern.  Read papers, give presentations, hold discussions, write formal proofs or essays, etc.  Try to have fewer than 50% of your meetings center on reading and/or discussing pre-existing material.  (Ideally, fewer than 33%.)</li><li>Consider setting long-term agendas, i.e., six months or a year of meetings that stay near a particular swath of the territory and allow for the group to build up a body of knowledge and progress.</li><li>If setting a long-term agenda, build in wiggle room for things that aren’t part of that swath (e.g., every third meeting is deliberately not consistent with the overall arc).</li><li>Consider assigning someone to take minutes and collate them in a permanent place, such that you can look back over the arc of a given season or year.  Consider whether or not it feels valuable to go over minutes from the previous meeting at the start of each meeting.</li><li>At the end of a meeting, assign someone to collect and email out questions that people intend to mull over, or thoughts that will lead into the next meeting.  Consider deciding in advance who will be leading what at the next meeting, so they have a reason to prepare and to show up.</li><li>Ensure that you have up-to-date contact information for all full members and associated/interested parties.  Think in advance about whether you want to do email messages, FB groups, individual texts, etc.</li><li>Consider what relationship you want to have with other MIRIx groups, such as sharing minutes or questions or occasionally sending or receiving ambassadors.  Take agentic action in causing such things to happen, if you want them—remember that you’re part of a class, and if you want it but never take steps to bring it about, this is probably true of lots of other people as well.</li><li>Consider whether you want to run events for the general public or potential new recruits (e.g., in math or CS departments).  Consider whether you want to try more ambitious projects, like the Human-Aligned AI Summer School, and reach out to people with knowledge and resources to do it well rather than reinventing the wheel.</li><li>If your MIRIx chapter is in an academic setting, be sure to figure out what sort of pipeline you want to form, so that you have underclassmen who are invested and ready to take over when the older students graduate.  If not in an academic setting, consider how you want to go about recruiting new members.  Note that a large influx of new members is rarely useful, and compounds the culture problem; it’s better by far to add new people one or two at a time, with plenty of time to acculturate.</li><li>Remember that the quality of the research and discussions and the MIRIx chapter as a whole is dependent on the actions of individuals, and how those actions combine.  Be sure to impress this upon <em>every</em> member—your MIRIx is only as good as each of you individually chooses to make it.</li></ol><p> ⠀ </p><h2>Epilogue</h2><p>You’ve nearly reached the end of the document!  Hopefully, this contained non-zero useful information, as well as a healthy amount of food-for-thought.  Before you go, we recommend that you take 30 seconds or so to ponder each of the following questions:</p><ul><li>Why did we choose to write this document?  What were we expecting from it, and what caused us to select this particular format and content, out of all of the possibilities?</li><li>Where are you still hungry or frustrated or dissatisfied?  What’s missing from this document, that we failed to address?  How did you come to be aware of this/these thing/s that we missed?</li><li>What sort of document would <em>you</em> write?  How would you know if it was a good idea to write one, or not?  How would you decide what to put into it?</li><li>How the hell does progress even get made?</li></ul><p> ⠀ </p><p>Happy hunting,</p><p>- The MIRI research team</p>",,abramdemski,abramdemski,abramdemski

<h1>World preferences vs identity preferences</h1>
<p>Some time ago, I <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/kgQCpiuHwDWNgz7E4/preferences-over-non-rewards"">wrote a post</a> about ""preferences over non-rewards"". I'm planning to collect most of these preferences into the category of ""personal identity"": the sort of being you want to be.</p>
<p>The ""You're not the boss of me!"" preference from that post - meaning you change your preferred action because you were told to/told not to - is very similar to the ""4 Problems with self-referential <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\Theta""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">Θ</span></span></span></span></span></span>"" from <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Y2LhX3925RodndwpC/resolving-human-values-completely-and-adequately"">this post</a>, and will be both be grouped under ""personal identity"".</p>
<p>It's my hope that all human preferences and meta-preferences can be synthesised into one of ""world preferences"" or ""personal identity preferences"". As this post suggests, the methods of aggregation may be different for the two categories.</p>

Though, of course this doesn't mean there shouldn't be, or else i wouldn't have wrote the post :)</p><h2><strong>basic concept</strong></h2><p>big problems can't be solved by a single person. but sometimes even a large group of people who agree on the problem and the solution, and are even motivated to bring the change - can't do it. That is because <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/oLGCcbnvabyibnG9d"">some</a> <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9QxnfMYccz9QRgZ5z/the-costly-coordination-mechanism-of-common-knowledge"">problems </a>are more complicated than that.</p><p>one such complication is coordination problems - where ""everyone is taking some action A, and we’d rather all be taking action B, but it’s bad if we don’t all move to B at the same time."" or each individual wouldn't want to take action A unless he knows the rest do too.</p><p>solutions to coordination problems include common knowledge (Where all know the intentions of all actors) and pre-commitment. that's the site's goal.</p><p><strong>Coordinated actions</strong></p><p>Any user can become a coordinator/initiator by creating a <strong>coordinated action</strong> (CA), in order to solve some problem. Each CA gets its own page (similar to kickStarter). Any user (unless otherwise specified) can obligate to the action - and here's the catch - the commitment is to be realized if and only if a certain number of other users obligated the same. In KickStarter, we commit to pay, here we commit to take action.</p><p><strong>Versatile coordination:</strong></p><p>Since reality is very dynamic, a rigid structure will work for few situations and be less useful. So to allow a large array of projects, options for CAs should be versatile. I see it as an ongoing project that will develop next to the community's needs. think of how tesla is implementing features in dialog with their community's wishes. here are some examples of ""contracts"":</p><p><i>Basic</i>: all of us obligate to some CA if X others do too.</p><p><i>milestones</i><strong>: </strong>many actions, listed on the same initiative, which are taken at different amounts of obligations. It is either required to obligate for all actions, or possible to obligate to specific actions only.</p><p><i>Obligation for obligation</i><strong>:</strong> a group or individual obligate for something, if a different group or individual obligate for the same or a different action (only one side can be an individual).</p><p>Please comment with more types that you can think of, it's very interesting.</p><p><strong>further support</strong></p><p>And sometimes just committing isn't enough for you, or you support the initiative but done that action (in cases of one time decisions, like going vegan, going zero-waste, getting rid of your car, etc...). So we want to give users a way to support further than just obligating. One example is an option for users would to donate money to the campaign, which will be used to further spread it, through some kind of advertising.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Communities</strong></h2><p>This is where it gets quite complex, but it has to. people don't want a thousand random humans around the world to something with them. they want people from their country, from their city, from their profession/hobby/Interest-area, from their social circle or organization.</p><p>That's where communities come in, the ideal is that for every real-world community you would be able to create a community on the site to resemble it, and that if people from that community are already on the site, they will find out that a new community they belong to has been opened, and will join. the reason is, so it's possible to coordinate action with and within certain communities.</p><p>When i first thought about how communities will work in practice it reminded me of set theory, but thinking about it more, it ended up merely resembling it (and probably breaks some of its laws). still, hopefully mentioning it helps to visualize.</p><p><strong>the communities structure</strong></p><p>There are many communities, it's easy and accessible to create new ones, or join existing ones (Unless said community has some requirements). any community is a sub and/or parent community of other communities. The goal is that the communities on the site will be able to reflect the communities in the real world.</p><p>some examples of communities: The earth (The parent of all communities until we colonies mars) and the user base<span class=""footnote-reference"" role=""doc-noteref"" id=""fnrefevpuxzy3j66""><sup><a href=""#fnevpuxzy3j66"">[1]</a></sup></span>, all regions/continents, and all countries, are some that can be added per-launch. examples for user added communities: cities, EA, farmers is Israel, bus drivers in new York, vegans is the US, LessWrong, etc...</p><p>""that's a lot communities.."", you say? ""like, <strong>a ton </strong>of communities"", yeah, that's true. but that's how it should be.</p><p>it might sound a bit like FB, but except the community grouping aspect, there are two more important differences. here we don't want two groups which are basically the same (Cause that's ineffective, if the real world community is divided between them on the site), and the user doesn't have to be aware of all the communities they're part of<span class=""footnote-reference"" role=""doc-noteref"" id=""fnrefqikr6msra6q""><sup><a href=""#fnqikr6msra6q"">[2]</a></sup></span>, which may feel weird in a online platform, but that's how it is in real life.</p><p>Whenever a user joins a community he is suggested sub-communities he might fit in, and is automatically added to all parent communities, which he can manually exclude themselves from (I bet the set theoreticians winched). part of the account creation process would be spotting the user's communities (easy ones, for example, are countries and cities)</p><p><strong>organizations</strong></p><p>not only individual humans are ""agents"" in this world, but also some communities, like, corporations, non-profits, and any other goal oriented group. organizations will be able to create a community around themselves, but also act as a user on the site. this is important, cause some coordinated actions seek not only the cooperation of single humans, but of the groups they make. if vegans think of taking a coordinated action together, they want to know that the businesses and organizations they support will go with them too. some CAs will be relevant only for organizations, where it doesn't matter how many individuals commit to take some action, they have to have cooperation from their own group.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Motivation and verification</strong></h2><p>At least until all of our society is nice, educated and rational - We need two mechanisms, one that verifies who really cooperated and who defected, and a mechanism to discourage defecting, and encourage cooperation.</p><p><strong>fulfillment verification</strong></p><p>Verification is the much harder of the two. how do you verify that someone tried veganism for 28 days? how do you verify that someone has/hasn't posted certain types of posts to FB? Can you verify whether someone really voted third party? whether they went to work that day? Some stuff are easier to verify, but if we stuck only to actions that are easy to verify, this tool won't be very useful. It's a hard-shell to crack, but it needs cracking - ideas?</p><p><strong>user verification</strong></p><p>In this system it's important that we know user = person, even better if we know user = which person. It can also help with fulfillment verification. There are many ways to do it - Email, phone, face, PayPal(?), ID. it just needs to be. maybe not all users have to be verified, yet still possible for communities and CAs to require verification.</p><p><strong>Motivation&nbsp;</strong></p><p>given that we solved verification - motivation is simpler. a few options:</p><p><strong>cooperator/defector score:</strong> users have a publicly displayed score that shows how they acted on their obligations.</p><p><strong>Achievement badges:</strong> I envision something similar to khan academy's badges, but harder to get so they're more meaningful. an example of one ""<strong>good to have:</strong> on average, you referred to each coordinated action you obligated to, at least 10 fulfilled obligations."" You can display these badges on your profile to signal how <i>awesome </i>you are :)</p><p><strong>putting your cash where your mouth is:</strong> for each CA, either there's a set amount or the initiator sets it, each user deposits cash against his cooperation - if he defects, he looses that money, if he cooperates, if he wins some extra money. This is a pretty much bound-to-work motivator (unless bill gates starts using this too), But i'd rather incorporate money as a last resort, If we find that we really need this extra motivator, since it makes everything more complicated. It also makes the verification task harder, since if people can use the site as a money-pump, they'll be more likely to look for a backdoor to exploit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I believe this concept, if it was successfully realized, could bring great benefits to the world.</p><ol class=""footnotes"" role=""doc-endnotes""><li class=""footnote-item"" role=""doc-endnote"" id=""fnevpuxzy3j66""><span class=""footnote-back-link""><sup><strong><a href=""#fnrefevpuxzy3j66"">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=""footnote-content""><p>yeah, both are all users, but i see reasons to differentiate, sorting wise - communities might have a counter feature of how many people in the real world community are registered to this online community, in the users it's a 100%, in the world.... you'd target different CAs to the user base and ""the whole world"". and, Sub community sorting is based on the real world, not the website, so the farmers of Israel are only part of the earth community and not the website's User Base. possible sub-communities are active users, contributors, etc...</p></div></li><li class=""footnote-item"" role=""doc-endnote"" id=""fnqikr6msra6q""><span class=""footnote-back-link""><sup><strong><a href=""#fnrefqikr6msra6q"">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=""footnote-content""><p>Hard to estimate exactly how much, but it's at least a few dozens and maybe more than a hundred</p></div></li></ol>",,Yoav Ravid,yoav-ravid,Yoav Ravid

I am asking every person smarter than me to explain to me, why my answer must be wrong. More so: There may even be some very basic mathematics below. I am very keen to find out why this mathematics is either wrong or irrelevant – or simply stupid. It sure is!</p><p><em>I define time as the amount of information available for a given phenomenon.</em></p><p>If there is a lot of information, then the phenomenon is considered to exist for a very long time. If only little information is available, the phenomenon is considered to exist for a very short time only.</p><p>For example, if a guy called Join Doe is traveling from Berlin to Moscow, there might be at least two bits of information about this:</p><ul><li>John Doe is in Berlin</li><li>John Doe is in Moscow</li></ul><p>If there is no other information available, then the phenomenon is very short lived, meaning John was traveling at maximum speed. That could be the speed of light.</p><p>But there might be more information available: John might take a stop in Minsk, because he loves a most beautiful Belarus girl at that place. It just means, that his travel speed is much slower. Far from the speed of light in this very case! So there is more time between his departure in Berlin and his arrival. It might even happen, because he is so very much in love with this girl, that he will never arrive in Moscow. In that case, the amount of time between departure and arrival is infinite.</p><p>Time <code>T</code>can thus be seen as function of the discrete amount <code>N </code>of available information: <code>T(N)</code> We know that for any <code>N_1,N_2</code> with <code>N_2 &gt; N_1</code>there will always be <code>T(N_2) &gt; T(N_1)</code>.</p><p><em>(But apart from that I do not really know a lot about the function</em> <em><code>T(N)</code>.)</em></p><p>Please note that by this definition there is no direction associated with time! So, time does not really tell us if Johnny starts his journey in Berlin or in Moscow. We can only be sure that he was in Minsk, and that he was having a great time there, wishing to stay for ever with the girl. (Maybe she also really cares a lot about him!)</p><p>Things are getting more interesting, if we – for example – consider a black hole. As we know by the theory of relativity, time <em>“is slowing down”</em> a bit, the nearer you get to a black hole. Now, let us look at John Doe again: Imagine this guy is getting really close to a black hole. <em>(There is no reason whatsoever to compare his relationship with his girl to a black hole or find any other similarities or even more vulgar comparisons related to her.)</em> Just imagine that John is attracted to the black hole just as he is attracted to his girl friend. The nearer he is getting to the black hole, the lesser are his chances to escape. A black hole squeezes a lot of matter into a tiny space, increasing its gravitational field and decreasing time in comparison to other people lucky enough to stay farer away from the black hole. (Still, please no comparisons to the girl friend!)</p><p>If John finally reaches the center of the black hole, there will be no more doubt about his very location. No longer will he be in Berlin! He will not be in Moscow, nor in Minsk. No matter how often we would request his position, we will always be sure that we could find him in the center of the black hole. Thus the amount of available information about his position has reached infinity, the uncertainty about his whereabouts has reached <code>0</code>, and thus time will now longer flow. Time will stand still, and there will be no time at all at the center of a black hole.</p><p>As you can see, we can explain the behaviors of time in a very strong gravitational field, even without the nasty complexity of general relativity.</p><p>Let me give you another example: <em>The double-slit experiment, seen from the viewpoint of quantum theory.</em> As we know, getting information about a quantum system always implies doing an <em>experiment</em>, and the results will vary depending on their probabilities. The more experiments we do, the more information we will get about the location of a particle. Some very smart people would most likely say, that the Schrödinger equation collapses with each experiment, meaning that a probability wave will turn into some (trivial) information about something. Whatever that means, it is obvious to us that information pops up in exchange of a certain amount of uncertainty that we are loosing on the way.</p><p><strong>We consider time to be just the sum of all the information gathered during experiments.</strong></p><p>In particle physics, the path of a particle is somewhat indeterminate. No matter how many experiments we do, we will only end up with an approximate path of the particle. OK. But if we repeat the experiment under the exact same conditions, we might end up with a completely different path, only depending on some probabilistic rules determined by the maths of quantum physics.</p><p>But with our understanding of time that does not really bother us any longer. There is no order in time. Time does not flow from 0 to <code>infinity</code>, always in the same direction. It is just the sum of all the information that we can gather. And that does not need to be the same all the time!</p><p><strong>Now you know what time is!</strong></p>",,alexander-weinmann,alexander-weinmann,Alexander Weinmann

In <i>my</i> culture…”</p><p>…and then they’ll go on to explain something that one might easily mistake for a rule, or a request, or the enforcement of a social norm, but which is <i>actually</i> (as far as I can tell) just a statement about the version of the world they carry around inside their head.</p><p>Because none of us <i>quite</i> have the same culture, after all. We all differ in different ways from the Basic Package—even those of us who’ve lived in the same towns, gone to the same schools, worked in the same industries, played the same sports, read the same books, watched the same shows—we’ve all got our own unique little takes, built up out of the odd quirks of our parents, tiny traumas and formative experiences, countless accumulated musings about how Things Could Be So Much Better If Everyone Would Just _________!</p><p>And so Your Culture, though it might match mine at a thousand different points, will also be noticeably different at a thousand others. You and I would found different churches, write different constitutions, build different schools and startups—</p><p>—and we would recognize different things as trespasses or offenses, and react to those trespasses and offenses in different ways.</p><blockquote><p><i>“They must talk to each other directly, Ender, mind to mind. What one thinks, another can also think; what one remembers, another can also remember. Why would they ever develop language? Why would they ever learn to read and write? How would they know what reading and writing were if they saw them? Or signals? Or numbers? Or anything that we use to communicate? This isn’t just a matter of translating from one language to another. They don’t have a language at all. We used every means we could think of to communicate with them, but they don’t even have the machinery to know we’re signaling. And maybe they’ve been trying to think to us, and they can’t understand why we don’t respond.”</i></p><p><i>“So the whole war is because we can’t talk to each other.”</i></p><p><i>“If the other fellow can’t tell you his story, you can never be sure he isn’t trying to kill you.”</i></p></blockquote><p>There’s a particular school of therapy called Internal Family Systems, which was founded on the basic insight that a lot of the stuff we’d come up with for mediating conflicts between family members could <i>also</i> be used for handling disagreements within oneself. Identify conflicting impulses, goals, and restraints, loosely anthropomorphize them as child-figures or parent-figures or spouse-figures or sibling-figures, and treat them with the same sort of respect you’d offer real quarreling humans, and voilà—suddenly a bunch of interpersonal tools and skills can be used to make personal therapeutic progress.</p><p>In a similar fashion, my colleague has been doing something like adapting the tools of <i>international diplomacy</i> for use in difficult conversations between family and friends and coworkers. Not by demanding that everyone follow <i>their</i> rules, and not by asserting any one culture’s superiority over another, but simply by <i>acknowledging the fact</i> that their culture meaningfully differs from everyone else’s. By taking that fact <i>seriously,</i> the same way that diplomats do, and putting forth conscious effort to work sensibly around it.</p><p>I don’t claim to know what’s going on in my colleague’s head, but from the outside, the process I see looks something like this:</p><ul><li>Someone will make a move that’s generally known to be okay in the broader context culture, but which would be recognized as mildly offensive or blasphemous if everyone were on the exact same cultural page as my colleague (like offering a handshake to a business partner from Thailand).</li><li>They’ll pause, and do their best to make that aspect of their culture transparent and accessible and comprehensible—“in my culture, if someone is in the middle of a thought the way I just was, and somebody else interrupts in the fashion that just happened, this is generally interpreted to mean X, Y, and Z about what was going on in both our heads and what our relative positions are and so forth, and it has such-and-such ripples through the social fabric of the conversation, and as a side note I get the sense that you expect me to be able to just pick back up in the middle of the sentence but actually this isn’t a reasonable expectation because in my culture thoughts don’t quite work like that.” The emphasis is always on clarifying the sort of Rube Goldberg causal structure of the culture—if you push button A, you’ll get effect B, and if you want effect C, you should push button D, and here’s why those specific if-then relationships make sense in context.</li><li>If necessary, they’ll ask for clarification about the <i>other</i> person’s culture. If, say, it wasn’t entirely clear how the other person might have thought their actions were good and correct, or if there’s any lingering resentment about the trespass that might be cleared up by a richer understanding of where the other person was coming from.</li><li>Occasionally, there’ll be a negotiation about which norms should be adopted in the larger context—whether side A’s norms, or side B’s norms, or a specific compromise between the two, or a set of triggers for distinguishing when to do A versus when to do B. More often, though, it’s simply left up to everyone to do what makes sense, given <i>both</i> the knowledge that things-will-sometimes-land-this-way <i>and</i> the knowledge that this doesn’t compel anyone to change their behavior in any particular way.</li></ul><p>(It happens to be a part of this particular conversational culture that <i>sharing something about yourself</i> is distinct from <i>making a request of others;</i> i.e. you can say “X results in me being sad” without implying “if you continue to do X, you’re bad/will be interpreted as intentionally trying to harm me.”)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I find this beautiful. Beautiful enough that it is now one of the foremost elements of <i>my</i> culture—that in my culture, this is a move people can make, and which I myself will make unilaterally. Not only does it allow me to reduce the number of unnecessary spats and misunderstandings to the theoretical minimum—</p><p>(i.e. fewer and fewer trespasses happen “for no reason;” I and my conversational partners asymptotically approach a state in which all the disagreements are <i>real</i> disagreements, and not just translation confusions over what was intended by a given hand gesture or conversational move)</p><p>—but it also gives me a glimpse into each person’s vision of <i>utopia</i>. The tiny flaws that each person sees in the larger culture around them, the tiny little fixes and wishes that they’ve built up in themselves over the years—when I’m embedded within a subculture that does this kind of cooperative conversational anthropology on the regular, it feels like I’m constantly expanding my sense of what-better-worlds-are-possible.</p><p>And there’s something particularly attractive (to me) about the frame of “this is <i>already</i> true in my culture.” It’s sort of like the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_Communication""><u>NVC</u></a> shift of expressing emotions and impacts rather than claims about other people’s intentions—even if you’re the only person with your particular culture, you <i>are</i> an example of it working, and so it’s less about arguing over the shared normspace and more about just laying out options and alternatives. “This is how it works for the people of Duncanland” is simultaneously more true and less confrontational than “but we all know we should X” or “obviously things would be better if Y” or “I can’t <i>believe</i> you would Z!”</p><p>(I think this applies all over the place. It’s often easy for requests of a cultural nature to either slide toward, or be interpreted as, something like “change your behavior to match my cultural expectations, or be seen as a bad person.” And naturally, even the <i>perception</i> that that’s what’s happening is enough to make some people dig in their heels—from that perspective, someone’s trying to move the <i>overall</i> culture to a new setpoint, and also preemptively allocating the costs of that shift. That’s the sort of thing that will reliably produce resistance in <i>some</i> fraction of humans, no matter the nature or magnitude of the request.</p><p>Whereas a statement like, “Oh, in my culture we do X, and we find this low-cost and mundane” highlights an <i>opportunity</i> for greater cooperativeness, but falls short of being a demand. The frame creates a boundary right from the start—this is <i>my</i> culture, not <i>everyone’s </i>culture, and therefore conformity is … contingent on relationship, or something? Like, you’ll certainly need to up your game in this area if you want to do a lot of business with me, but to the extent that our interactions are confined to the broader context culture, and to the extent that the norms I’m personally comfortable with are not actually universal in that culture, it’s more a matter of politeness/friendliness/extra credit. There’s a strong implication that your nonconformity, as long as it’s not clearly antagonistic, will be taken in good faith, just as someone from Greece will likely forgive you if you happen to forget that a thumbs-up is a rude gesture in their home culture. And surprise surprise, that gentler version is often <i>more</i> successful at getting people to willingly and cheerfully put forth effort than a version that is perceived as being tinged with demand or threat or judgment.)</p><p>And sure, it’s true that none of us actually have perfect introspection, and that maybe we think of things as being part of our personal culture that aren’t in practice, or we mislabel and misdescribe them, and maybe there are things that kind-of-work for us as individuals that would actually be disastrous if they were installed for everyone, and so on and so on. Perhaps simply declaring “in my culture, X is true” is overconfident or misleading.</p><p>But it seems much <i>less</i> overconfident than declaring “X is true for everyone,” or “X <i>should</i> be true for everyone,” and so it feels to me like a step in the right direction, even if it glosses over some important uncertainty/humility.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I want to zoom in for a moment and give some examples of the sorts of things that might fill in the blank after the words “in my culture.”</p><ul><li>What interactions between different classes of people are or are not okay (e.g. whether a high-school teacher can or can’t give their students permission to refer to them by their first name).</li><li>What certain actions are widely interpreted to mean (e.g. “everybody knows” that if you plead the fifth, it’s because you’re guilty).</li><li>What obligations you have when <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7cAsBPGh98pGyrhz9/decoupling-vs-contextualising-norms""><u>discussing controversial topics</u></a> (e.g. whether you have a responsibility to include historical context, or a responsibility to remain dispassionate and logical).</li><li>What sorts of idiosyncrasies are defections (e.g. whether it’s okay to go to a party and be the only one who remains sober).</li><li>The “rules of engagement” for various levels of disagreement or antagonism (e.g. whether it’s justified to engage in otherwise-disallowed behavior if it’s in response to someone else doing it first).</li><li>The order and ranking of swear words and epithets; which curses are mild and which are unspeakable and unforgivable.</li><li>What things are sacred and what things may be mocked.</li><li>Whether or not birthdays and anniversaries are special.</li><li>When and how to decide between focusing on people’s feelings and interpretations in a way that doesn’t particularly care about the truth of the matter (which is often useful for healing and processing) versus focusing on cause and effect and objectively verifiable truth (which is often useful for a lot of other things).</li><li>What it’s okay for an employer to ask of its employees, and whether or not society should put limits on what adults can freely agree to (e.g. questions about mandated minimum wage).</li><li>Which side of an argument or disagreement is the default, and which bears the burden of proof, and how that decision is made, and whether it’s made implicitly or explicitly.</li><li>Whether or not cargo shorts are a valid thing to wear, and whether or not the question “are cargo shorts a valid thing to wear?” is a valid one to pose.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The above list was generated mostly by me trying to recall examples of times I’ve found myself in disagreement with other white, college-educated, non-religious, American-raised, upper-middle-class males, to show that even people who look extremely similar to me on paper can still have meaningfully different cultures. And of course, that list could easily have been hundreds or thousands of entries long.</p><p>One important thing to note is that even the smallest and most trivial entries (like the cargo shorts thing) are more than enough to send destabilizing waves rippling through the social fabric—to turn a good evening into a bad one, for instance, or to spark long-lasting antipathy between people who were otherwise getting along just fine. The TV show Seinfeld got endless mileage out of just this sort of cultural mismatch, and it was resonant and successful in part because <i>that sort of thing happens all the time.</i> It’s sort of tragic, and it would be nice if we could do better, but as things currently stand it’s a part of our social reality.</p><p><img style=""width:650px"" src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/4EGYhyyJXSnE7xJ9H/ppjdqgldxvlzirc5iwnz"" alt=""""></p><p>This is part of why the diplomatic approach gives me cautious hope. It seems like a hammer in a world full of nails—the sort of thing that might <i>actually</i> make a difference, both in the moment and in the aggregate.</p><p>In that spirit, I’d like to take the remainder of this essay to outline a dozen or so of the more important and idiosyncratic customs that are native to <i>my</i> culture. It may be that none of them seem interesting to you, or worth the effort, but it may be that some of them are small gifts you’ll feel like giving me, on the level of learning to say “thank you” in someone’s native tongue, and it may be that some of them are worth taking home and tossing into your own cultural stew.</p><p>One last thought, though, before diving in to my own norms and traditions: there’s a difference between</p><p><i>noticing that there are many different cultures, and wanting to find a context culture that allows them to communicate and cooperate to the extent that there is mutual desire to do so</i></p><p>and</p><p><i>treating all cultures as fundamentally equally good or valid.</i></p><p>I don’t want to take a firm stance on the latter question in this particular essay. I certainly have opinions, but those opinions have enough doubt and fog and uncertainty that they’re not worth promoting. I simply want it noticed that you can advocate for the former (for practical reasons) <i>without</i> advocating for the latter (which seems like more of a moral or ethical question). Even when the US and the USSR were at each other’s throats over a conflict of cultures, they still were able to recognize the instrumental value of having a red phone, and that seems to me like it was the right move.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In my culture, everybody simply takes for granted the existence of a larger <i>context</i> culture that exists to foster communication, cooperation, conversation, compromise, and so on and so forth. It’s understood that this context culture emerged over the course of long, hard millennia of trial and error, with lots of death and suffering and war and outrage along the way, and that, while it’s far from perfect, it’s absolutely critical to the safety and success that those of us currently living in the developed, modern world rely upon and enjoy.</p><p>(For instance, the founding fathers of America were certainly aware of the flaws in the concept of religious freedom, but they rightly recognized that those flaws were <i>vastly less terrible</i> than the history of war and persecution and oppression that came from attempts to constrain how people worship.)</p><p>It’s understood that attempts to <i>change</i> this context culture are fraught with risk, and that sometimes even shining too bright of a light on its faults and failings can be a mistake. This is because, in any given room of 100 people, at least <i>some </i>will misunderstand a claim of “some part of this is bad” to mean “this whole thing is bad.” And of those, some will go on to virtuously attempt to tear down the whole thing, not realizing that they’re digging away at the foundation that lets us have any sort of civilization at all.</p><p>(To continue the religious freedom example, it’s often not clear to a young idealist why <i>even saying the sentence</i> “hey, is religious freedom actually the right way to go?” out loud in a public forum might be treated as a risky or dangerous act, especially given <i>other</i> cornerstones of our context culture like the enshrined freedom of personal expression. But in fact the sort of unofficial social pressure that is often brought to bear to discourage such expressions is an important part of the context culture’s immune system. Turns out that such sentences are often a prelude to atrocity, and even when they <i>aren’t</i>, it turns out that it’s reasonable for people to experience a kind of background elevated stress in response to hearing them, and even when it’s <i>not </i>reasonable, turns out some people will <i>anyway</i>, with corresponding downstream effects, and that wishing this weren’t the case or talking about how it <i>shouldn’t</i> be the case doesn’t actually fix it, and that much of the time we’d rather keep on quietly and imperfectly cooperating than engage with or tolerate a literally endless series of erosive complaints and suggestions.)</p><p>Thus, it’s known and acknowledged (in my culture) that all of the expressions below are <i>things which may not be possible</i> in the broader context culture. They are things which may be negotiated away in the service of building a world that accommodates more people. They are things which may occasionally be sacrificed, for the sake of collaboration across cultural lines. They are things which it is easy to find oneself arguing for with language that implies that <i>disagreement</i> is tantamount to <i>defection</i>—that one is either with you, and on the side of goodness and rightness, or on the <i>other</i> side—and in my culture we take the stance that letting oneself get away with that kind of slippery narrativemancy is a meaningful transgression against the larger context culture that lets us all live side by side in relative peace.</p><p>And so, <i>to the extent that we want to continue cooperating with people of other cultures</i> (i.e. to the extent that there is a diplomatic summit going on that you want to be a part of and are willing to make tradeoffs to <i>stay</i> a part of), people in my culture acknowledge that it is important to be careful, and to be charitable, and to prepare for one’s care and charity to be insufficient, and to be wary of poking holes in the social fabric, and to be ready to repair those holes that will inevitably accidentally be poked, and to—when writing an essay such as this one—take pains to draw a bright and solid line between “this is how it is in my home culture” and “this is a bid that the overall context culture shift in my direction,” and to not immediately dismiss a claim that we did not draw that line brightly and solidly enough.</p><p>Another way to put this is that, in my culture, if you want to engage in an act of civil disobedience in order to change the culture around you, it’s important that you <i>at least </i>stick around and let them arrest you and put you in jail. Otherwise (so say my cultural norms) you won’t be interpreted as trying to cooperatively influence that context culture, but rather as trying to outright undermine it and replace it with your own.</p><p>(Which is sometimes justified, to be clear. Sometimes you <i>are</i> trying to break the context culture, because the context culture is rounding up and murdering Jews and you symbolically going to jail won’t actually accomplish anything. The point is not that you should always cooperate with the context culture, but that you can’t have your cake and eat it too—you can <i>either</i> cooperate with it <i>or</i> break from it, and you should <i>pick.</i>)</p><p>(It’s worth noting that these points are so obvious in my culture that the first draft of this essay excluded them entirely, and my friends had to remind me to make them explicit. I just <i>took it for granted</i> that the rest of the post would be interpreted in that light, which is not at all obvious to people in cultures even only just a little bit different from mine.)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In my culture, with the exception of certain subsets of neuroatypicals or disabled persons, it is assumed that the vast majority of people over the age of (say) eight or nine are <i>straightforwardly acting in accordance with their will.</i></p><p>This is not to say that people don’t make mistakes. It’s not ignoring the fact that people often have their options constrained by circumstance. It’s not meant to legitimize or trivialize things like oppression and coercion and abuse.</p><p>But <i>in general,</i> for <i>most people,</i> <i>most of the time,</i> the assumption is that you are doing things mostly on purpose, and that the sum of your inner values is <i>revealed</i> through your visible actions—that you are pretty much always choosing your most-preferred option from the options available. In my culture, there isn’t really any such thing as <i>akrasia,</i> or a persistent inability to act in line with your values. It’s understood that people often have <i>aspirational</i> values—things which they genuinely wish they could express in their actions even though they currently kind of don’t—but in general if you’re not acting in line with those, it’s assumed that it’s because you have some other (possibly hidden) wants that are getting in the way.</p><p>Thus, in my culture, it’s considered reasonable and standard for people to model you and react to you as if you generally want and endorse the things you generally do. Your <i>revealed preferences</i> are taken to be a reflection of your net values in all but a few special cases. Hence, apologies are treated as falling somewhere between predictions and promises—if you are <i>genuinely</i> sorry, then in my culture you will demonstrate it through future action that meaningfully differs from past action. And if your future actions continue to resemble the past, people in my culture will conclude both that you <i>weren’t actually sorry</i> and also perhaps that your word can’t really be trusted in general.</p><p>(Another way to say this is that, in my culture, you get to decide what’s true <i>inside your head,</i> but other people are justified and supported in making predictions and taking actions based on what you <i>do in the world.</i> If you have a mood disorder that makes you judgmental and suspicious and unpredictably mean twenty percent of the time, you’re welcome to say “that’s not really me,” but other people are <i>not </i>mistreating you or morally bankrupt if they decide not to take the risk and end up avoiding you altogether—if, in essence, they <i>behave toward you</i> as if that really <i>is</i> part of your character.)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In my culture, it’s understood that emotions can be right or wrong—or, to use less charged language, they can be <i>appropriate responses</i> to a situation, or they can be <i>inappropriate responses.</i> In the latter case, it is absolutely still a sacred right to <i>have</i> the emotion (no one in my culture can tell you that you should feel a different way than you feel), but what you <i>do</i> with that emotion is constrained by social norms.</p><p>This means that if Alex does something, and Bailey becomes angry, and furthermore if both Alex and Bailey want to avoid such situations in the future, the fix could be on <i>either</i> side. It’s neither obviously on Alex to stop doing the thing, nor obviously on Bailey to leash their anger. Instead, the question at hand becomes something like “what actually happened? What are the relevant contextual details? How reasonable is it for Bailey to feel a sense of trespass at Alex’s actions? Was a commonly-acknowledged boundary violated? What about a rarely-acknowledged-but-previously-communicated-and-agreed-upon one? Sometimes people jump to conclusions, or make wrong guesses at motives, or get angry at a made-up caricature of the other person—is that happening in this case, or is Bailey’s anger a straightforward response to Alex’s observable actions?”</p><p>This may sound trivial or obvious, but it’s important to note that what this means, in practice, is that sometimes <i>I will feel wronged, and I will act in what feels like defense of myself or of important principles, and afterward <strong>I</strong> will have to apologize (and possibly accept punishment), because it will be deemed that my sense-of-being-wronged and my subsequent actions were not, in fact, an appropriate or justified reaction to the situation.</i> In my culture, when we find ourselves on the wrong side of judgment in this way, we often suck it up and make public peace even if we still hold resentment or uncertainty on the inside. Because otherwise—if your peers can’t ask for surface-level amends unless and until you’ve made a deep, internal update—you could simply get away with anything by sort of … weaponizedly never-noticing-you-were-wrong?</p><p>To put it another way, in my culture, sometimes one’s personal satisfaction must come second to a sort of public dance which maintains the norms and standards of the group as a whole, and those norms and standards are seen as sensible and necessary and worthy of occasional personal sacrifice.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In my culture, there are <i>limits</i> to the judgments you can hold about a person, and the predictions you can make about them, and those limits are derived from the complete set of your previous experiences of that person, leaving out nothing.</p><p>Another way to say this is that, in my culture, vague suspicions and unfounded intuitions are allowed only insofar as they are openly flagged as such, and in general will not carry much weight when they’re in conflict with a consistent, coherent, observable record.</p><p>(Although if a vague suspicion or unfounded intuition is born out, then the person who registered it will have earned a solid point in favor of being <i>good at making accurate predictions that run counter to existing data.)</i></p><p>This also means that updates about a person must be gradual and Bayesian, and that in general people are expected to seek the smallest possible update. If a seemingly loyal colleague has seemingly betrayed you, you are obligated in my culture to be confused and curious and look for alternate explanations, rather than leaping straight to a new story which contradicts all of your prior evidence. If you learn an unpleasant secret about someone (e.g. that they privately abuse heroin), your update is confined to the domain of that secret, and can’t be used to invalidate or dismiss their record of e.g. completing work projects on time or being kind to animals and the elderly.</p><p>(You might easily still be justified in firing them, if they are your employee, or ceasing to associate with them, if they are your friend. For instance, the new data might actually be relevant to your estimate of entangled qualities like their integrity or conscientiousness or decisionmaking or trustworthiness. But in general, even if the new data is damning, people in my culture make a conscious effort to compensate for the <a href=""http://www.rightattitudes.com/2010/04/30/rating-errors-halo-effect-horns-effect/""><u>human impulse to round everything off to a single answer</u></a>. Sometimes people aren’t simple or straightforward, and in my culture you can object to the costs associated with one trait without unjustly and inaccurately lowering your evaluation of the rest.)</p><p>Symmetrically, in my culture, there are limits to the kinds of claims you can make <i>about yourself.</i> If someone does not believe that you have Trait X, and you believe that you do, you’re not allowed to just <i>declare</i> that you do, and expect them to update. Instead, the most you can do is say something like “Look, of course you’re going to hold this with some skepticism, I endorse that—not that you <i>needed</i> me to endorse it, it’s not like you need my permission—but I claim I have Trait X, and I’d like you to accept that as a hypothesis, and give me a chance to prove it. Like, I’m requesting that you keep your radar open and be receptive to evidence on this question.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In my culture, unless you’ve made a specific commitment to the contrary, you can end any conversation at any time.</p><p>There are ways to do this which might be blunt or rude or cruel, and people might dock you social points for your bluntness or rudeness or cruelty.</p><p>But they will not dock you points <i>for the leaving itself</i>. In my culture, you do not owe anyone your attention, your ear, or your thoughts. If you and I were romantically engaged, and we broke up, and I am desperate for closure, that is <i>my</i> problem, not yours. If you <i>want</i> to provide me the opportunity to talk further, that’s great, but I have no right to demand it, and if I’m being pushy, other people will step in to remind you that you’re morally justified in simply cutting me off.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In my culture, if I cover the check and you agree to PayPal me your share, it is not up to me to remind you.</p><p>In my culture, if I lend you a book, I should not have to ask for it back.</p><p>In my culture, if you break something that I own, it goes without saying that you will take the initiative to replace it, or reimburse me, or make it up to me in some other fashion.</p><p>In my culture, failing to fulfill an obligation until someone else reminds you to do so is itself viewed as a transgression. It’s seen as imposing an additional cost upon your creditor, and onlookers will tend to notice that, and remember. There’s an <i>instrumental</i> argument for people to remind you anyway (since otherwise they might never get what you owe them), but in that case, it’s understood that you’ve lost an additional point, and have to either accept that fact or make up for it with some kind of concrete action.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In my culture, if you’re going to a Cirque du Soleil show, and one of your friends is a gymnast, it is viewed as slightly rude to fail to think of inviting them. Ditto if you’re planning a night of Magic: the Gathering and one of your friends is always lamenting a lack of people to play with.</p><p>You don’t have to <i>actually</i> invite them, if there’s reason not to. For instance, if you simply wouldn’t enjoy their company, or if they’re incompatible with someone else who’s already going. But it’s expected that you will <i>pause to ask yourself the question.</i> That you will <i>notice the opportunity</i> to include them, especially if their interest is sufficiently well-known that they might reasonably <i>expect</i> their name to come to mind. To fail to do so twice in a row will undoubtedly be taken as a signal that you dislike them or don’t particularly care for them or are willing to prioritize other things above their preferences in this domain, and they will update their expectations with regards to you accordingly.</p><p>(There’s an interpretation of this which sounds vaguely threatening, à la “invite me <i>or else.”</i> But in my culture it’s actually much gentler and more stoic than that—it’s more like “invite me, or I’ll update toward believing that you’re not the kind of person who will invite me.” That doesn’t have a strong moral shading of any kind, in my culture—it’s just <i>using the past to make predictions about the future.)</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In my culture, it is seen as trivially obvious that if a friend has to <i>ask</i> you whether or not you want a hug, the friendship is weak enough that the hug will probably not be particularly nourishing in the first place (since it comes with a reminder of distance and insecurity).</p><p>This is <i>not</i> to say that all hugs are always welcome—it’s a bad idea to simply hug people willy-nilly, or to offer hugs as a way to cargo-cult your way into a closer relationship. If you’re not sure, you ask anyway and pay the distance cost, or you just don’t hug at all.</p><p>Rather, the thing you aim for is to grow your friendship to the point where your friend knows you well enough, and feels secure enough in their relationship with you, that they can <i>tell</i> when you need a hug, and aren’t the slightest bit anxious that it’ll be taken badly if they happen to be wrong.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In my culture, birthdays matter, and celebrating birthdays matters, and remembering to celebrate birthdays matters, and actually knowing what kind of celebration will be warm and wanted is more important and more highly valued than the mere desire to do so.</p><p>(Another way to say this is that, in my culture, the thought <i>does</i> count, but other things count <i>more.</i>)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In my culture, we play <a href=""https://medium.com/@ThingMaker/in-defense-of-punch-bug-68fcec56cd6b""><u>punch bug</u></a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In my culture, if I’m trying to help you, it’s important both that it’s not about me <i>and</i> that it doesn’t <i>seem</i>, on the surface, that it’s about me.</p><p>(Note the “if.” Sometimes, the situation can be more complex, and my primary goal is not simply to help you, but to investigate a situation, or to protect myself along with you, or to preserve community norms and standards, etc.)</p><p>But <i>if</i> I’m actually in it for your benefit, as opposed to because your feeling bad makes me feel bad and what I really want is to stop feeling bad <i>myself—</i></p><p>If that is the case, then it’s important to avoid setting up a dynamic whereby you, who are already struggling and low on resources, feel pressure to reassure <i>me.</i> I don’t want to make it seem like my own failure to help will mean that <i>I</i> will not be okay, such that you have to put on a mask and <i>pretend to have been helped,</i> regardless of whether or not you really have. In my culture, we recognize that this is the opposite of helping—it’s adding yet another item onto the pile of stuff you have to deal with.</p><p>(Which is <i>not</i> to say that I’m not allowed to <i>feel distress</i>, and possibly take actions in accordance with that distress, when someone else is sending up distressing signals. If you express extreme depression and suicidal impulses to me, for instance, <i>of course</i> I’m going to have an emotional reaction.)</p><p>But absent any of those other considerations—if it’s just you and me in a room and my goal is to help—if I want to have any chance of <i>actually</i> helping you, it’s understood in my culture that it has to be clear that my own ego is not relevantly in the mix. It has to be clear that I’m <i>okay with you being sad/mad/stressed.</i> It has to be clear that I’m there to offer you tools and support to get at the root cause, not to punish you for your symptoms, and furthermore that if you don’t <i>want</i> my tools and support, or don’t find them helpful in the end, that’s okay too.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In my culture, we distinguish between <a href=""https://medium.com/@ThingMaker/its-not-what-it-looks-like-cde2c6104455""><i><u>what a situation looks like</u></i></a> and <i>what it actually is.</i></p><p>When we can’t tell the difference, we intentionally form <i>two</i> reactions—one appropriate for each possibility—and we take only provisional and reversible actions (or actions that are good in <i>both</i> branches of possibility) until we have some hint as to what’s actually true.</p><p>(To make this more concrete: in my culture, there simply isn’t anything like the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_lacrosse_case""><u>Duke lacrosse scandal</u></a>. That sort of unjustified public excoriation just doesn’t happen.)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In my culture, we believe that a peace treaty is not a suicide pact.</p><p>Civilization works (at least in part) by mutual agreement to <i>set aside options</i>. As the Freud quote goes, “the first person to hurl an insult instead of a stone was the founder of civilization.” We learn in kindergarten not to hit each other as a method of expressing disagreement—we <i>mutually sacrifice</i> that option, trading the ability to hit at will for the safety of not having to be constantly on alert against being hit.</p><p>But in my culture, there’s a distinction between “I agree to follow these rules with everyone I interact with” and “I agree to follow these rules with everyone who also agrees with them.”</p><p>This can be tricky when it comes to balancing my culture with the needs of the broader context culture that allows us all to coexist. If Lord Duellington comes from a culture where people get into duels over perceived insults, it needs to be <i>really crystal clear</i> to everyone else at the diplomatic summit that Lord Duellington <i>really understands that this aspect of his culture is not shared</i>, and that there is <i>zero</i> chance that Lord Duellington will propose a duel, regardless of how insulted he perceives himself to be<i>.</i></p><p>Even the mere <i>perception</i> of Lord Duellington as a loose cannon who cannot distinguish between [his own local culture] and [what’s agreed-upon by everyone present] is costly, regardless of whether or not it’s true, because it results in a dynamic where other people at the summit feel like they have to spend lots of energy and attention tracking and maintaining their personal physical safety, rather than being able to rely on the social contract. Thus, it’s important that Lord Duellington not even mutter under his breath that <i>back home, we have a way of dealing with people like you</i>, and it’s entirely reasonable for people to disinvite Lord Duellington from future summits if he does.</p><p>(Although it’s also reasonable in my culture for Lord Duellington to object that his track record indicates that he would never actually do such a thing, and that it’s not fair for people to see him as a risk, as noted above. But it can <i>both</i> be true that he’s not actually a direct risk, and <i>also</i> be true that his presence nevertheless puts too much stress on the social fabric to be worth it, and even Lord Duellington will admit that this is possible.)</p><p>This is why, for instance, I no longer use my car’s horn as a tool for reacting to perceived defections in traffic. In my home culture, certain traffic violations effectively equate to <i>opting out</i> of the treaty whereby people don’t honk at each other.</p><p>In the Bay Area context culture, though, that’s a sort of violence that isn’t justified <i>even by overt defection</i>, as far as I can tell<i>.</i> People will socially punish it even if they agree that the honker was wronged, because use of the horn for that purpose is seen as corrosive in other ways.</p><p>(For instance, it hurts nearby people as well, and reduces the effectiveness of the horn as an exclusively emergency signal, and grabs people in a sort of deep, visceral, monkey-brain kind of way that is almost guaranteed to escalate the situation rather than resolving it.)</p><p>And it seems correct to conform to the context culture in this way, and for others to expect <i>you</i> to conform, regardless of your home culture. A clause that releases you from the social contract <i>in your home culture</i> does not have the power to release you from the social contract <i>at a diplomatic summit. </i>The whole <i>point</i> of a diplomatic summit is that people are setting aside their native standards for what constitutes transgression, and agreeing to a cooperative compromise culture. If a person isn’t willing to make that sacrifice, then the diplomatic summit can’t afford to have them around, no matter what value is lost in the process of excluding them.</p><p>But in my <i>home </i>culture, if Cameron is behaving toward Dallas in ways that are proscribed by social norms, and Dallas has tried a couple of times to get Cameron to stop, and has actually made efforts to bridge the gap, and has taken actions which reasonably rule out the possibility that Cameron was just making a one-time mistake out of frustration or misunderstanding or whatever—</p><p>In my home culture, if Dallas retaliates in kind, no one will assign Dallas the sort of blame they would otherwise receive for taking a forbidden action.</p><p>And if <i>Elliott</i> steps in to protect Dallas from Cameron, and uses Cameron’s tactics against them, no one will look sideways at Elliott, either.</p><p>In my culture, there’s a fundamental difference between people who are <i>trying to play by the rules,</i> and people who are <i>unmistakably willing to violate them.</i> The former category gets a <i>lot</i> of protection, and the latter gets meaningfully less, especially when it comes to open antagonism. In my culture, we try to be really damn sure that it’s <i>actually</i> fire, and not just smoke, but we are indeed willing to fight fire with fire, and we don’t dock one another points for doing so.</p><p>I sometimes <a href=""https://medium.com/@ThingMaker/moderating-lesswrong-4de028808def""><u>wish that other specific </u><i><u>sub</u></i><u>cultures had more in common with my home culture in this way</u></a>, but I think that it’s correct that the broader context culture does <i>not</i>, because the whole thing rests on the idea that there can be clear common knowledge about what constitutes a transgression and what doesn’t, and that everyone can see what’s justified and what isn’t, and that seems to me to be an impossibly naive expectation when we’re talking about a diplomatic summit with representatives from thousands of individual cultures.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is not at all a complete list. On reflection, it’s probably not even the <i>most</i> important differences between my culture and the general culture—just some of the <i>more</i> important ones, the ones which floated to the top over the two weeks I spent tinkering with this essay. No doubt I’ll discover more after hitting ‘publish.’</p><p>But it’s okay that this is incomplete, because me sharing <i>my</i> culture is only half of the process. The other half is you sharing <i>yours</i>, and so this feels like as good a place as any to pause and listen, in case you feel like talking.</p><p>(If enough people respond in commentary here or elsewhere I may write a followup someday on other people’s specific cultures.)</p>",,Duncan_Sabien,duncan-sabien-inactive,Duncan Sabien (Inactive)

This was due to a conversation with Dylan Hadfield-Menell.</p>
<p>This post will ignore subagents, and answer Dylan's original question: can we deduce the goals of a hierarchical system? So, we assume the subpieces of the system are not subagents worthy of ethical consideration. Now, given that the subpieces could be inefficient at ""what they're supposed to be doing"", how can we assume the system itself has a goal?</p>

<p>Here the criteria <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\texttt{C(G)}""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-texatom""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mtext""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-type-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">C(G)</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> just assess whether the plan will move the situation closer to the goal <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""G""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">G</span></span></span></span></span></span>.</p>
<p>Let's look at the subalgorithm that is generating the suggested plans, which I labelled SPG (suggested plan generator). It takes the State <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""S""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.032em;"">S</span></span></span></span></span></span> and Goal <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""G""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">G</span></span></span></span></span></span> as inputs.</p>
<p>It is obviously bad at its job: turning on the radio is not necessary or useful for gripping B. It's not utterly incompetent at its job, though: turning on the radio and then gripping B, will at least result in B getting gripped.</p>
<h2>The job of an algorithm is to do its job</h2>
<p>I've been talking about SPG's 'job'. But how do I know what this is (especially given that the term is <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05812"">probably undefinable in theory</a>)?</p>
<p>Well, there are a number of indications. First of all, akin to ""<a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/rcXaY3FgoobMkH2jc/figuring-out-what-alice-wants-part-ii"">figuring out what Alice wants</a>"", we have the evocative names of the various variables: State, Goal, Suggested plans. If these labels <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/EEPdbtvW8ei9Yi2e8/bridging-syntax-and-semantics-empirically"">are grounded</a>, then they clearly indicate what the intended task of SPG is.</p>
<p>Note also that there is a loop where the plans of SPG are run until <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""G""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">G</span></span></span></span></span></span> is true. Even if the symbols are ungrounded, and even if SPG were a black-box, this indicates that fulfilling the the goal <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""G""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">G</span></span></span></span></span></span> is the purpose of Algorithm 3, and that SPG contributes to this. In this loop, we also have the assessment criteria <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\texttt{C(G)}""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-texatom""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mtext""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-type-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">C(G)</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>, checking whether the plan will move closer to <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""G""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">G</span></span></span></span></span></span> or not; given some weak assumptions, this is also an indication that <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""G""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">G</span></span></span></span></span></span> is a goal of Algorithm 3, and that coming up with plans that reach <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""G""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">G</span></span></span></span></span></span> is the job of SPG.</p>
<h2>Bad job, unoptimiser</h2>
<p>The previous criteria can establish what the job of SPG is, but doesn't allow us to say that it's bad at its job. It seems to be bad because turning on the music is an unnecessary step.</p>
<p>But imagine (situation 1) we're now looking higher in the algorithm hierarchy, and there is a cost function that counts how many steps are used to achieve the goals. Then we can say that SPG is doing a bad job; but the full criteria of that the system wants have not been passed down to the Algorithm 3 and SPG level.</p>
<p>Conversely, imagine (situation 2) we're looking higher in the algorithm hierarchy, and there is not cost function, but there is a desire for the radio to be on. Then SPG is doing a good job, even though the full criteria have not been passed down.</p>
<p>Especially if the system is capable of self-modification, we shouldn't expect all the job criteria to be located close to the subsystem itself. It's possible that a cost-assessor (in situation 1) has tried to analyse the whole system, and deemed SPG's inefficiency to be minor. Or, conversely, that a radio-turn-on assessor (in situation 2) has analysed the whole system, noticed SPG's behaviour, and let it be (or even added it in), because this helps achieve the systems's overall goal.</p>
<h1>The general case</h1>
<p>So in general, the role of a subroutine in a hierarchical system is to achieve the task that whatever called that subroutine wants it to achieve. The nature of this task can be be inferred by looking at grounded symbols, and/or at the structure of the algorithm that calls the subroutine, including what it does with its output. Some goals may be implicit, and handed down from higher in the algorithm's hierarchy.</p>
<p>Note that if the subroutine takes actions - either in the real world or by modifying global variables within the algorithm - these can also be used to define its task, especially if the global variables are grounded or the meaning of the actions are clear.</p>
<h2>Better implementation</h2>
<p>Once the role of all subroutines is established, the goal of the whole system can be estimated. Again, grounded variables are useful, as are the purposes that can be inferred by the fact that the system calls a certain subroutine (with a certain role) at a certain point.</p>
<p>Then once this goal is established, we can talk about how the system might improve itself, by making the outcome more in-line with the goal. But we can't talk about improvements in an abstract sense, without establishing this goal first. Even seemingly useless parts of the system, <a href=""http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.50.9691&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf"">may be there</a> <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Obfuscated_C_Code_Contest"">deliberately</a>.</p>
<h2>More structure and information</h2>
<p>The more structure a system has, the easier, in general, it is to assess its goal. If there are top-level subroutines that go around assessing the lower levels, then the assessment criteria are major components of the system's goal.</p>
<p>However, it might be that the system doesn't give us enough information to figure out its goal, or that multiple goals are compatible with it (this is most strongly the case if the systems variables are poorly grounded). This is to be expected; we <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05812"">can't infer the goals of a general agent</a>. In this case, we are allowing some assumptions about grounded symbols, internal models, and hierarchical structure, to cut down on the space of possible goals. This might not always be enough.</p>

In a <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/vphFJzK3mWA4PJKAg/coherent-behaviour-in-the-real-world-is-an-incoherent#F2YB5aJgDdK9ZGspw"">previous comment</a>, I suggested that we can formalize ""coherent"" in a different way to dodge this criticism. I believe there's reason to think that Eliezer never intended ""Sufficiently optimized agents appear coherent"" to have an airtight argument and be universally true. (The Arbital post contains a number of caveats, including ""If there is a particular kind of optimization pressure that seems sufficient to produce a cognitively highly advanced agent, but which also seems sure to overlook some particular form of incoherence, then this would present a loophole in the overall argument and yield a route by which an advanced agent with that particular incoherence might be produced"".) In this post, I suggest that considering the ways in which it could be false can be a useful way to frame some recent ideas in AI safety. (Note that this isn't intended to be an exhaustive list.)</p>
<h1>Distributional shift</h1>
<p>Even a very powerful optimization process cannot train or test an agent in every possible environment and for every possible scenario (by this I mean some sequence of inputs) that it might face, and some optimization processes may not care about many possible environments/scenarios. Given this, we can expect that if an agent faces a new environment/scenario that's very different from what is was optimized for, it may fail to behave coherently.</p>
<p>(Jessica Taylor made a related point in <a href=""https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/5bd75cc58225bf06703751eb/modeling-the-capabilities-of-advanced-ai-systems-as-episodic-reinforcement-learning#section-6"">Modeling the capabilities of advanced AI systems as episodic reinforcement learning</a>: ""When the test episode is similar to training episodes (e.g. in an online learning context), we should expect trained policies to act like a rational agent maximizing its expected score in this test episode; otherwise, the policy that acts as a rational agent would get a higher expected test score than this one, and would therefore receive the highest training score."")</p>
<p>A caveat to this caveat is that if an agent is optimized for a broad enough range of environments/scenarios, it could become an explicit EU maximizer, and keep doing EU maximization even after facing a distributional shift. (In this case it may be highly unpredictable what the agent's utility function looks like outside the range that it was optimized for. Humans can be considered a good example of this.)</p>
<h1>Optimize for low compute</h1>
<p>Eric Drexler <a href=""https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/reframing/"">suggested</a> that one way to keep AIs safe is to optimize them to use few computing resources. If computing resources are expensive, it will often be less costly to accept incoherent behavior than to expend computing resources to reduce such incoherence. (Eliezer noted that such incoherence would only be removed ""given the option of eliminating it at a reasonable computational cost"".)</p>
<p>A caveat to this is that the true economic costs for compute will continue to fall, eventually to very low levels, so this depends on people assigning artificially high costs to computing resources (which Eric suggests that they do). However assigning an optimization cost for compute that is equal to its economic cost would often produce a more competitive AI, and safety concerns may not be sufficient incentive for an AI designer (if they are mostly selfish) to choose otherwise (because the benefits of producing a more competitive AI are more easily <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality"">internalized</a> than the costs/risks). One can imagine that in a world where computing costs are very low in an economic sense, but everyone is treating compute as having high cost for the sake of safety, the first person to <em>not</em> do this would gain a huge competitive advantage.</p>
<h1>The optimizing process wants the agent to remain incoherent</h1>
<p>The optimizing process may itself be incoherent and not know how to become coherent or produce an agent that is coherent in an acceptable or safe way. A number of ideas fall into this category, including Peter Eckersley's recent <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00064"">Impossibility and Uncertainty Theorems in AI Value Alignment (or why your AGI should not have a utility function)</a>, which suggests that we should create AIs that handle moral uncertainty by randomly assigning a subagent (representing some moral theory) to each decision, with the argument that this is similar to how humans handle moral uncertainty. This can clearly be seen as an instance where the optimizing process (i.e., AI programmers) opts for the agent to remain incoherent because it does not know an acceptable/safe way to remove the incoherence.</p>
<p>A caveat here is that the agent may itself decide to become coherent anyway, and not necessarily in a way that the original optimizing process would endorse. For example, under Peter's proposal, one subagent may take an opportunity to modify the overall AI to become coherent in a way that it prefers, or multiple subagents may decide to cooperate and merge together into a more coherent agent. Another caveat is that incoherence is economically costly especially in a competitive multi-polar scenario, and if such costs are high enough the optimizing process may be forced to create a coherent agent even if it would prefer not to (in the absence of such costs).</p>

<p>Previously (Patrick Sullivan at Star City Games): <a href=""http://www.starcitygames.com/articles/38349_The-London-Mulligan-A-Game-Designers-Take.html"">The London Mulligan: A Game Designer’s Perspective</a></p>
<p>We’ve now had about a week to think about the London Mulligan rule. I’ve changed my mind several times in that period. There are big advantages and big disadvantages. It’s not obvious which should dominate.</p>
<p>My preliminary conclusion is that this is quite bad for Modern, Legacy and Vintage, and probably small positive for Limited. I’m increasingly confident it’s also bad for Standard.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Advantage 1: Less Fully Dead Games</h3>
<p>This is the headline reason. It’s a big one.</p>
<p>Going to six is a big disadvantage but often survivable. Going to five and winning is a story. Going to four is so bad it often raises the question of whether it’s worth playing your first land and revealing what deck you’re running. Being down two or more cards is bad enough without the risk of not having any lands, or missing your color, or not having early spells.</p>
<p>Because mulligans are so bad, players often keep seven card hands that don’t have much action, or that need a land soon in order to play Magic at all. Making mulligans less hostile lets those dead games be avoided as well.</p>
<p>With the new rule, you get to look at all seven cards on six. You are much more likely to have a reasonable mix of lands and spells, and at least do some things. At five cards, you are probably going to have the number of lands you want, usually two or three, and a few reasonable spells. You’re down two cards, but you otherwise get to play.</p>
<p>This is very good. When I look back upon my experiences at the Pro Tour and Grand Prix in Cleveland, most of the games were great fun, but the dead games were the exceptions, and result in standing around for a long time waiting for the next round.</p>
<p>Minimizing those games is a big win. Such games can even be an exit point where people quit playing.</p>
<p>How many do we get to avoid? Definitely a substantial number, but also definitely not the majority.</p>
<h3>Disadvantage 1: More Time In Mostly Dead Games</h3>
<p>The direct danger in avoiding free wins is that we might turn games on four or five cards into long agonizing struggles that never had a chance. Whereas before, you could lose quickly and move on. This is especially true when playing online. Doubly true on the ladder in Arena.</p>
<p>In a weird way, the game being completely over right away is kind of a <em>benefit. </em>You can say, that’s Magic, this happens, time to move on. The lost opportunity is bad, but if you can go play another match, it’s not a big deal.</p>
<p>Some of my least favorite experiences are games where you’re 1%, or 0.1%, to win, and the game is mostly out of your hands. Hello, Nexus of Fate and Teferi, Hero of Dominaria. You sit there watching your opponent go through the motions, in case something really strange happens and you can get back in it. A hundred such games later, you have one win and a great story. You also have ninety-nine (relatively) miserable stretches of your life you will never get back.</p>
<p>The indirect danger is that if going to five or fewer cards gives you some chance of winning, then players will choose more often to go to five or fewer cards to get a hand of land and spells. But not enough land or spells.</p>
<p>So instead of a world in which you’re either dead quickly or mostly alive, there’s a world in which you’re usually mostly dead.</p>
<p>Note that this is <em>especially bad </em>online and in Arena. The moment your game is done you can start a new one, so fully dead games are not a big problem. Mostly dead games effectively force you to concede or tough it out, which feels bad and blameworthy both ways.</p>
<p>This contrasts with paper Magic in tournaments, where sticking it out takes time you would have otherwise had to wait.</p>
<h3>Advantage 2: Increased Agency, Skill Testing and Sense of Agency</h3>
<p>With the London mulligan, you are making more decisions when sculpting your opening hand. Patrick noted this as a big advantage – you think there was something you could have done.</p>
<p>With the current mulligan rule, most hands are straightforward keeps or mulligans, and most scry decisions are easy as well since you usually either want most lands or most spells. There are marginal hands and a few marginal cards to keep or not keep, but that’s mostly it.</p>
<p>This still allows good players to get a substantial edge from making good mulligan decisions, as the few decisions left matter a lot and are easy to get wrong. Whenever I read one of the ‘keep or mulligan’ columns I find big disagreements, and these can be among the hardest and least intuitive decisions in the game.</p>
<p>Still, it leaves a lot of room for improvement.</p>
<p>The London mulligan means more hands that can plausibly go to six or fewer cards, more hands that <em>do </em>go to six or fewer cards, and a much more complex decision if you keep a smaller hand. How much land do you want? Do you need to gamble on finding the right lands, or risk a flood? Should you ensure you have good early plays at the expense of long term power when you’re already down on cards? Or should you keep your powerful cards to try and catch up?</p>
<p>Those are often going to be intense, interesting decisions. All choices are lousy, but some are much more likely to win than others.</p>
<p>It’s not clear to me that this is an improvement.</p>
<p>Even recently, have you seen the last 10 Pro Tour performances from Luis Scott-Vargas and Reid Duke? It’s hard to say this isn’t a skill game. It’s hard to lose sleep over it not being more of one.</p>
<p>There are plenty of places one could add or subtract skill testing, and my guess is that right now this level of skill testing is where Wizards wants it. I don’t think they are far from the ideal balance, so good job there.</p>
<p>Despite that, many players express a desire for the game to be more skill testing. If one considered this an advantage, that could be a strong argument for the London Mulligan.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if one thinks that skill testing is otherwise <em>expensive, </em>that we could make an otherwise better game if we needed less of it, we could increase skill testing here so we could stop buying it elsewhere. That too could be good.</p>
<p>The other danger is that while this increases the skill testing during the mulligan, it risks decreasing skill testing elsewhere for all the wrong reasons, as we’ll see later on. It <em>probably </em>results in a more skill testing game at least in Standard, but it’s not <em>obvious </em>that it does on net.</p>
<h3>Disadvantage 2: Increased Sense of Agency in Inevitable Losses</h3>
<p>Patrick’s definitely on to something when he points to players having a sense they had a way out.</p>
<p>Can this backfire as well? I think it can.</p>
<p>The same way there’s something soothing about a 0% chance of winning and a chance to move on, there’s also something reassuring about knowing there’s nothing you could have done. You made the only decisions you could, or all reasonable decisions definitely lost.</p>
<p>When I was playing <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2018/11/22/review-artifact/"">Artifact</a>, I loved that every game I lost was somehow my fault. I might not have won with perfect play, but I would have had a <em>better chance. </em>I always had a way to improve. Magic’s not like that. A <em>tournament </em>of Magic is like that. If you think you couldn’t have improved all day, you’re wrong. Individual games often aren’t. If you didn’t see land three until turn ten, you could have bluffed a little better, or gotten more information out of the opponent, but it likely wasn’t going to much matter.</p>
<p>When in <a href=""https://jamesclear.com/deliberate-practice-theory"">deliberate practice</a> mode, finding ways to improve is great. But there’s reasons a lot of players aren’t in that mode too often. One of those reasons is that it often feels a lot better to chalk one up to bad luck. Good for the ego and soul. You didn’t have a choice (remember, <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/07/22/choices-are-bad/"">choices are bad</a>) which makes it all much easier to take.</p>
<p>You know how you should never look at the top of your library after you mulligan, but you do anyway and it’s terrible and you <em>know </em>it’s terrible but you don’t stop? It’s a lot like that. You suddenly know if only you’d done this seemingly insane thing you’d have been in it, or even won, and now you feel a lot worse about the whole thing. <em>How was I supposed to know to do that, </em>you repeat to yourself. And probably, you weren’t supposed to know, or to do it. But that can be small comfort, sometimes.</p>
<p>This can also combine with disadvantage one. When choosing what to do with a five or six card hand, there will often be a choice between the fast option, where you plan to go for it, hope your opponent stumbles and you win quickly, or the slow option where you hope you can survive and slowly get out. The second option means a likely slow and painful death, which you’d prefer not to choose, but given the choice you feel blameworthy for not taking it.</p>
<p>When the <em>most winning </em>play pattern isn’t the <em>most fun </em>play pattern, it’s a problem, and I worry this is going to encourage that here. And in other ways, as we continue.</p>
<h3>Disadvantage 3: Increased Importance of Scouting</h3>
<p>Knowing what your opponent is playing becomes much more important if you make impactful card selection decisions before the game begins!</p>
<p>It’s already important with the current mulligan rule, as some hands don’t play well against some decks. If you have the chance to <em>sculpt </em>your hand, that takes it to another level. In many games, what card to place on the bottom will be the biggest decision made. Often it will be a guessing game, where your removal spell is dead in some places and the best card in others. The result will be more worry about mini–games around scouting and field knowledge that most players prefer to avoid. We’d much rather play the games.</p>
<p>With opponents having stronger and more consistent opening hands, not only will you be making these decisions more often, those decisions will be more vital to keeping pace. You won’t have much time to draw out of it if you’re wrong.</p>
<h3>Disadvantage 4: Increased Reliance on Key Cards, Combinations and Play Patterns</h3>
<p>What’s the deck in history that most benefits from the new rule? Who wants to draw one key card, or a key combination of cards, almost no matter what?</p>
<p>Dredge decks with Bazaar of Baghdad would be thrilled (until the inevitable restriction) but there’s a limited deck that occasionally got played that I think has them beat: 39 Swamps and 1 Pack Rat.</p>
<p>Once you accept you’re never having six Swamps in play, the additional cards don’t matter even a tiny bit. All you care about is finding the Pack Rat. If you find it and it lives, you probably win. If it dies or you fail to find, you lose. That’s it.</p>
<p>That’s the ultimate in extreme contrast. Your other cards are all so bad that you’re better off hoping to draw one copy of one card, than trying to play Magic normally.</p>
<p>This is not something we want to encourage.</p>
<p>It’s easy to see how dangerous such options are for Modern, and even easier for Legacy and Vintage.</p>
<p>It’s also popular to dismiss this as ‘Dredge is an abomination regardless’ or some variation thereof. So is Lantern. So is Amulet. So is Tron? So are a good portion of Modern’s other decks?</p>
<p>Even in Standard, decks that are much stronger when they have one key card, or one of two key cards, will both be stronger and be sorely tempted to mulligan a lot of otherwise fine seven card hands to find what they need, even in game one.</p>
<p>Consider a Standard world in which blue mulligans a lot of its playable hands without Curious Obsession, many green decks go seeking either a Llanowar Elves or a Wildgrowth Walker engine, Nexus decks won’t keep hands without a Growth Spiral or Search for Azcanta, and white decks won’t start on seven without either History of Benalia or Legion’s Landing.</p>
<p>After sideboard things get much worse. The classic example is someone with a Leyline of Sanctity or Leyline of the Void, who will mulligan to find it almost no matter what, and an opponent who in turn is going to mulligan to Nature’s Claim. That’s not what I think of as fun. Standard versions of this are less dramatic, because Wizards stopped printing sideboard cards (which I think is a mistake, but that’s another debate), but now that you know what you’re up against and what you need, there’s still going to be a lot of ‘this perfectly good hand won’t get it done.’</p>
<p>The examples could be wrong, as I haven’t played some of the decks, but the point remains.</p>
<p>Many of the best Magic games are about dealing with unexpected or awkward combinations of cards, and improvising what to do with strange hands and interactions. the London Mulligan will push decks towards having their best cards and most obvious play patterns more often. Hands without them will get mulligans, and mulligans will put the less key cards on the bottom. Both seem quite bad.</p>
<h3>Disadvantage 5: Increased Pressure to Mulligan, Including Into Oblivion</h3>
<p>We’ve talked about increased mulligan pressure. That pressure in turn puts even more pressure on. Can a Drake or Esper deck keep a hand without a quick removal spell when it’s so often facing such threats? If your opponent keeps seven do you basically have to assume that they ‘have it’? That second turn Wildgrowth Walker must mean Jadelight Ranger, right?</p>
<p>More seven card hands get thrown back as likely to get overrun, polarizing things even more. Then, six card hands that can’t deal with seven card hands, that are facing a seven card hand, face increasing pressure to go to five. Before, you’d stop the spiral at six (and five) due to how terrible it was to keep going, even if keeping was bad, but now keeping a lousy hand is death since you know they’re on a strong seven, and throwing back gives some hope.</p>
<p>It may well be correct even in Standard to give up a substantial portion of games to the death spiral, and dramatically increase mulligan rates, to maximize your chances. Then we’re no longer even decreasing the number of dead games.</p>
<h3>Ambiguous: Advantage of Playing First</h3>
<p>I can’t tell if this will make going first that much more imperative, since both players often have strong hands, or reduce the card counts so much that playing first is less attractive.</p>
<p>It’s not something I worry about too much, unless the effect is very large. There’s a lot of randomness in Magic. That’s a good thing. Players like to point to the die roll and complain about it, but one must roll with the punches. I doubt this effect is going to be big either way.</p>
<h3>Disadvantage 6: More Glass Cannons, both Deck Choice and Deck Configuration</h3>
<p>Deck construction and deck selection will change. Players will build decks that rely on finding key cards, and accept that failure to find means mulligan. <em>There will be no point in creating backup plans if those plans are not good enough to prevent a mulligan. </em></p>
<p>Tron decks, for example, won’t plan much for what to do without Tron. What they do without Tron is, they lose. Same with other decks that rely on key cards, and have a reasonable shot at getting them. It becomes reasonable to simply assume one of eight cards will show up. Some matches after boarding the <em>entire plan </em>becomes finding the one key card at almost any cost. More subtle options are given up.</p>
<p>Decks become about doing one key thing as well and fast as possible. Sideboards become about finding the one true answer, or the one true answer to the one true answer. More and more players put in discard or removal for key answers, instead of tuning their strategies.</p>
<h3>Conclusion: More Dangerous, In Subtler Ways, Than You Think</h3>
<p>The changes in the mulligan rules so far have had real effects on deck choice and deck balance, but have been well worth those costs. Magic is self-balancing to a large extent, as the metagame adjusts to changes. Having games where players start on six or five, and where they get some free card selection, were small enough adjustments that things mostly went on as before.</p>
<p>The London Mulligan is different.</p>
<p>The increase in card selection, and in the quality of mulligan hands, versus the bonus from a scry 1, is several times bigger even at six cards. I believe that even in Standard this would have large effects on how decks are played and configured, and how often key cards and play patterns occur. It would shift Magic into a game that is much more about gambles before the game begins, much more centered on central cards and strategies, and much more focused on the early turns. These changes threaten to form vicious cycles, where others going down such roads forces you to do the same.</p>
<p>More time will be spent in games with five or six card hands that have little chance of winning, but which aren’t hopeless enough to give up, especially hurting when playing online.</p>
<p>There will be more and more pressure to do things that can win off of five or fewer cards, either from a key combination or raw aggression, or some other way. These will not be as many cool, complex Johnny decks.</p>
<p>This could be quite bad, including directly undoing the key advantage of avoiding dead games. Players will often mulligan themselves into a small hand with little or no chance, hate that they (correctly) gave their seven card hand away, and have lots of feel bad moments. The games where interesting and different things happen and you learn to deal with it become less common.</p>
<p>I approve of <em>trying new dangerous things. </em>I think that <em>this is a worthy experiment. </em>That’s why I’m calling this <em>on </em>the London Mulligan, rather than <em>against. </em>Experiments are cool, and they are how we learn. We have a great game. Let’s do science to it!</p>
<p>There’s a chance this will all turn out great. Perhaps I’m seeing mirages, or things whose magnitude is an order lower than I fear. That definitely happens. In that case, great.</p>
<p>There’s a chance this will be an obvious disaster, degenerate decks and strategies run rampant, and everyone vows never to do that again. In that case, <em>great again. </em>Glad we did that.</p>
<p>What worries me is that this will be <em>subtly </em>bad. The decks that do well in London will look <em>somewhat </em>different, with more decks that can operate on fewer cards and more true silver bullets and answers to bullets, but with decklists and win percentages that still mostly look like Modern. The damage will be more in the play patterns that result, the escalating mulligan frequencies and importance of the pregame, the increased focus on key cards even when the decklists barely change. I worry that will happen, <em>and it will be easy to miss. </em></p>
<p>Then, by the time the damage is done, it might be too late.</p>

<p>A summary of this post <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/rmBS5nTJh6pxERWEu/short-summary-of-mairy-s-room"">can be found here</a> - it even has some diagrams.</p>
<p>The central idea is that thinking in terms of AI or similar artificial agent, we can get some interesting solutions to old philosophical problems, such as the Mary's room/knowledge problem. In essence, simple agents exhibit similar features to Mary in the thought experiments, so (most) explanations of Mary's experience must also apply to simple artificial agents.</p>
<p>To summarise:</p>
<ul>
<li>Artificial agents can treat certain inputs as if the input were different from mere information.</li>
<li>This analogises loosely to how humans ""experience"" certain things.</li>
<li>If the agent is a more limited (and more realistic) design, this analogy can get closer.</li>
<li>There is an artificial version of Mary, mAIry, which would plausibly have something similar to what Mary experiences within the thought experiment.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Mary's Room and the Knowledge problem</h1>
<p>In <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_argument"">this thought experiment</a>, Mary has been confined to a grey room from birth, exploring the outside world only through a black-and-white monitor.</p>
<p>Though isolated, Mary is a brilliant scientist, and has learnt all there is to know about light, the eye, colour theory, human perception, and human psychology. It would seem that she has all possible knowledge that there could be about colour, despite having never seen it.</p>
<p>Then one day she gets out of her room, and says ""wow, so that's what purple looks like!"".</p>
<p>Has she learnt anything new here? If not, what is her exclamation about? If so, what is this knowledge - Mary was supposed to know everything there was to know about colour already?</p>
<p>Incidentally, I chose ""purple"" as the colour Mary would see, as the two colours most often used, red and blue, lead to the confusion as to what ""seeing red/blue"" means - is this about the brain, or is it about the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone_cell"">cones in the eye</a>. But seeing purple is strictly about perception in the brain.</p>
<h2>Example in practice</h2>
<p>Interestingly, there are real example of Mary's room-like situations. Some people with red-green colour-blindness can <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1X0QTTtPmc"">suddenly start seeing new colours</a> with the right glasses. Apparently this happens because the red and green cones in their eyes are almost identical, so tend to always fire together. But ""almost"" is not ""exactly"", and the <a href=""https://www.technologyreview.com/s/601782/how-enchromas-glasses-correct-color-blindness/"">glasses force green and red colours apart</a>, so the red and green cones start firing separately, allowing the colour blind to see or distinguish new colours.</p>
<h1>Can you feel my pain? The AI's reward channel</h1>
<p>This argument was initially presented <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/s7EMqZwTe8B973nDK/the-ai-in-mary-s-room"">here</a>.</p>
<h2>AIXI</h2>
<p>Let's start with the least human AI we can imagine: <a href=""https://jan.leike.name/AIXI.html"">AIXI</a>, which is more <a href=""http://hutter1.net/ai/uaibook.htm#oneline"">an equation than an agent</a>. Because we'll be imagining multiple agents, let's pick any computable version of AIXI, such as <a href=""http://www.hutter1.net/ai/paixi.pdf"">AIXItl</a>.</p>

<p>So what are these reward channels to these agents? It would go too far to call them <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualia"">qualia</a>, but they do seem to have some features of pleasure/pain in humans. We don't feel the pleasure and pain of others in the same way we feel our own. We don't feel counterfactual pain as we feel real pain; and we certainly wouldn't agree to suffer maximal pain in exchange for knowing how we could have otherwise felt maximal pleasure.

<h1>mAIry in its room</h1>
<p>So we've established that artificial agents can treat certain classes of inputs in a special way, ""experiencing"" their data (for lack of a better word) in a way that is different from simple information. And sometimes these inputs can strongly rewire the agent's brain/variable values.</p>
<p>Let's now turn back to the initial thought experiment, and posit that we have a mAIry, an AI version of Mary, similarly brought up without the colour purple. mAIry stores knowledge as weights in a neural net, rather than connections of neurons, but otherwise the thought experiment is very similar.</p>
<p>mAIry knows everything about light, cameras, and how neural nets interpret concepts, including colour. It knows that, for example, ""seeing purple"" corresponds to a certain pattern of activation in the neural net. We'll simplify, and just say that there's a certain node <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""n_p""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">n</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mi"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.446em;"">p</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> such that, if its activation reaches a certain threshold, the net has ""seen purple"". mAIry is aware of this fact, and can identify the <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""n_p""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">n</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mi"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.446em;"">p</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> node within itself, and perfectly predict the sequence of stimuli that could activate it.</p>
<p>If mAIry is still a learning agent, then seeing a new stimuli for the first time is likely to cause a lot of changes in the weights in its nodes; again, these are changes that mAIry can estimate and predict. Let <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""c_p""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">c</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mi"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.446em;"">p</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> be a Boolean corresponding to whether these changes have happened or not.</p>
<h2>What dreams of purple may come...</h2>
<p>A sufficiently smart mAIry might be able to force itself to ""experience"" seeing purple, without ever having seen it. If it has full self-modification powers, it could manually activate <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""n_p""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">n</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mi"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.446em;"">p</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> and cause the changes that result in <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""c_p""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">c</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mi"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.446em;"">p</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> being true. With more minor abilities, it could trigger some low-level neurons that caused a similar change in its neural net.</p>
<p>In terms of the human Mary, these would correspond to something like self-brain surgery and self-hypnosis (or maybe self-induced dreams of purple).</p>
<h2>Coming out of the room: the conclusion</h2>
<p>So now assume that mAIry exits the room for the first time, and sees something purple. It's possible that mAIry has successfully self-modified to activate <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""n_p""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">n</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mi"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.446em;"">p</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> and set <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""c_p""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">c</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mi"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.446em;"">p</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> to true. In that case, upon seeing something purple, mAIry gets no extra information, no extra knowledge, and nothing happens in its brain that could correspond to a ""wow"".</p>
<p>But what if mAIry has not been able to self-modify? Then upon seeing a purple flower, the node <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""n_p""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">n</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mi"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.446em;"">p</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> is strongly activated for the first time, and a whole series of weight changes flow across mAIry's brain, making <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""c_p""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">c</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mi"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.446em;"">p</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> true.</p>
<p>That is the ""wow"" moment for mAIry. Both mAIry and Mary have experienced something; something they both perfectly predicted ahead of time, but something that neither could trigger ahead of time, nor prevent from happening when they did see something purple. The novel activation of <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""n_p""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">n</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mi"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.446em;"">p</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> and the changes labelled by <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""c_p""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">c</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mi"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.446em;"">p</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> were both predictable and unavoidable for a smart mAIry without self-modification abilities.</p>
<p>At this point the analogy I'm trying to draw should be clear: activating <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""n_p""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">n</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mi"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.446em;"">p</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> and the unavoidable changes in the weights that causes <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""c_p""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">c</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mi"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.446em;"">p</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> to be true, are similar to what a TD-Lambda agent goes through when encountering unexpectedly high or low rewards. They are a ""mental experience"", unprecedented for the agent even if entirely predictable.</p>
<p>But they are not evidence for <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiphenomenalism"">epiphenomenalism</a> or against physicalism - unless we want to posit that mAIry is non-physical or epiphenomenal.</p>
<p>It is interesting, though, that this argument suggests that qualia are very real, and distinct from pure information, though still entirely physical.</p>

<p>There are less artificial examples than <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""U_y""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base"" style=""margin-right: -0.084em;""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.084em;"">U</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mi"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.519em; padding-right: 0.006em;"">y</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>; a friendly utility function with a high discount rate would find any delay intolerable (""by not breaking out and optimising the world immediately, you're murdering thousands of people in intense agony, <em>you monster</em>!"").</p>
<h2>Abstract low-impact</h2>
<p>This is has been my recurrent objection to many attempts to formalise low-impact in abstract terms. We live in a universe in which every action is irreversible (damn you, <a href=""https://www.theonion.com/christian-right-lobbies-to-overturn-second-law-of-therm-1819565726"">second law</a>!) and the consequences expand at light-speed across the cosmos. And yet most versions of low impact - including <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10720"">my own attempts</a> - revolve around some measure of ""keeping the rest of the universe the same, and only changing this tiny thing"".</p>
<p>For this to make sense, we need to classify some descriptors of the world as ""important"", and others as ""unimportant"". And we further need to establish what counts as ""small"" change to an ""important"" fact. You can see this as assigning utility functions to the values of the important descriptors, and capturing low impact as ""only change to these utility functions in <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\mathcal{U}""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-texatom""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-cal-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.372em; padding-right: 0.061em;"">U</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>"".</p>
<p>But you absolutely need to define <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\mathcal{U}""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-texatom""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-cal-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.372em; padding-right: 0.061em;"">U</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>, and this has to be definition that captures something of human values. <a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01186.pdf"">This paper</a> measures low-impact by preserving vases and penalising ""irreversible"" changes. But every change is irreversible, and what about preserving the convection currents in the room rather than the pointless vases? (""<em>you monster!</em>"").</p>
<p>So defining <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\mathcal{U}""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-texatom""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-cal-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.372em; padding-right: 0.061em;"">U</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> that are compatible with human models of ""low-impact"", is absolutely essential to getting the whole thing to work. Abstractly considering all utility functions (or all utility functions defined in an abstract action-observation sense) is not going to work.</p>
<p>Note that often the definition of <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\mathcal{U}""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-texatom""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-cal-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.372em; padding-right: 0.061em;"">U</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> can be hidden in the <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/DuPjCTeW9oRZzi27M/bounded-rationality-abounds-in-models-not-explicitly-defined"">assumptions of the model</a>, which will result in problems if those assumptions are relaxed or wrong.</p>
<h2>The general intuitive disagreement</h2>
<p>The objection I made here applies also to concepts like corrigibility, domesticity, value-learning, and similar ideas (including <em>some</em> versions of toolAI and Oracles). All of these need to designate certain AI policies as ""safe"" (or safer) and other as dangerous, and draw the line between them.</p>
<p>But, in my experience, this definition cannot be done in an abstract way; there is no such thing as a generally low-impact or corrigible agent. Defining some subset of what humans consider corrigible or tool-like, is an essential requirement.</p>
<p>Now, people working in these areas don't often disagree with this formal argument; they just think it isn't that important. They feel that getting the right formalism is most of the work, and finding the right <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\mathcal{U}""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-texatom""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-cal-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.372em; padding-right: 0.061em;"">U</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> is easier, or just a separate bolt-on that can be added later.</p>
<p>My intuition, formed mainly by my many failure in this area, is that defining the <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\mathcal{U}""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-texatom""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-cal-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.372em; padding-right: 0.061em;"">U</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> is absolutely critical, and is much harder than the rest of the problem. Others have different intuitions, and I hope they're right.</p>
<h1>Strictly easier than friendliness</h1>
<p>The problem of finding a suitable <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\mathcal{U}""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-texatom""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-cal-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.372em; padding-right: 0.061em;"">U</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> is, however, strictly easier than defining a friendly utility function.</p>
<p>This can be seen in the fact that there are huge disagreements about morality and values between humans, but <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7nLMhdhXMKBLWiynJ/why-safe-oracle-ai-is-easier-than-safe-general-ai-in-a"">much lower disagreement</a> on what an Oracle, a low-impact, or a corrigible agent should do.</p>
<p>""Don't needlessly smash the vases, but the convection currents are not important"" is good advice for a low impact agent, as agreed upon by people from all types of political, moral, and cultural persuasions, including a wide variety of plausible imaginary agents.</p>
<p>Thus defining <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\mathcal{U}""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-texatom""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-cal-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.372em; padding-right: 0.061em;"">U</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> is easier than coming up with a friendly utility function, as the same low-impact/corrigibility/domesticity/etc. is compatible with many different potential friendly utility functions for different values.</p>

TKk7rShf9d5ePN7vR,Personalized Medicine For Real,personalized-medicine-for-real,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/TKk7rShf9d5ePN7vR/personalized-medicine-for-real,2019-03-04T22:40:00.351Z,214,96,16,False,False,,"<p>I was part of the founding team at MetaMed, a personalized medicine startup.  We went out of business back in 2015.  We made a lot of mistakes due to inexperience, some of which I deeply regret.</p>
<p>I’m reflecting on that now, because <a href=""https://www.perlara.com/"">Perlara </a>just went out of business, and they got a lot farther on our original dream than we ever did. <a href=""https://www.qstatebio.com/"">Q-State Biosciences</a>, which is still around, is using a similar model.</p>
<p>The phenomenon that inspired MetaMed is that we knew of stories of heroic, scientifically literate patients and families of patients with incurable diseases, who came up with cures for their <em>own </em>conditions.  Physicist Leo Szilard, the “father of the atom bomb”, <a href=""https://library.ucsd.edu/dc/object/bb75101231/_1.pdf"">designed a course of radiation therapy</a> to cure his own bladder cancer.  Computer scientist Matt Might <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/10/health/matthew-might-rare-diseases.html"">analyzed his son’s genome</a> to find a cure for his rare disorder.  Cognitive scientist <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Tenenbaum"">Joshua Tenenbaum</a> found a personalized treatment for his father’s cancer.</p>
<p>So, we thought, could we try to scale up this process to help more people?</p>
<p>In Lois McMaster Bujold’s science fiction novels, the hero suffers an accident that leaves him with a seizure disorder. He goes to a medical research center and clinic, the Durona Group, and they design a neural prosthetic for him that prevents the seizures.</p>
<p>This <em>sounds </em>like it ought to be a thing that exists. Patient-led, bench-to-bedside drug discovery or medical device engineering.  You get an incurable disease, you fund scientists/doctors/engineers to discover a cure, and now others with the disease can also be cured.</p>
<p>There’s actually a growing community of organizations trying to do things sort of in this vein.  <a href=""https://www.recursionpharma.com/"">Recursion Pharmaceuticals</a>, where I used to work, does drug discovery for rare diseases. <a href=""https://sv.ai/"">Sv.ai</a> organizes hackathons for analyzing genetic data to help patients with rare diseases find the root cause.  Perlara and Q-state use animal models and in-vitro models respectively to simulate patients’ disorders, and then look for drugs or gene therapies that reverse those disease phenotypes in the animals or cells.</p>
<p>Back at MetaMed, I think we were groping towards something like this, but never really found our way there.</p>
<p>One reason is that we didn’t narrow our focus enough.  We were trying to solve too many problems at once, all called “personalized medicine.”</p>
<p><strong>Personalized Lifestyle Optimization</strong></p>
<p>Some “personalized medicine” is about health optimization for basically healthy people. A lot of it amounts to superficial personalization on top of generic lifestyle advice. Harmless, but more of a marketing thing than a science thing, and not very interesting from a humanitarian perspective.  Sometimes, we tried to get clients from this market.  I pretty much always thought this was a bad idea.</p>
<p><strong>Personalized Medicine For All</strong></p>
<p>Some “personalized medicine” is about the claim that the best way to treat even <em>common </em>diseases often depends on individual factors, such as genes.</p>
<p>This was part of our pitch, but as I learned more, I came to believe that this kind of “personalization” has very little applicability.  In most cases, we don’t know enough about how genes affect response to treatment to be able to improve outcomes by stratifying treatments based on genes.  In the few cases where we know people with different genes need different treatments, it’s often already standard medical practice to run those tests.  I now think there’s not a clear opportunity for a startup to improve the baseline through this kind of personalized medicine.</p>
<p><strong>Preventing Medical Error</strong></p>
<p>Some of our founding inspirations were the work of Gerd Gigerenzer and Atul Gawande, who showed that medical errors were the cause of many deaths, that doctors tend to be statistically illiterate, and that systematizing tools like checklists and statistical prediction rules save lives.  We wanted to be part of the “evidence-based medicine” movement by helping patients whose doctors had failed them.</p>
<p>I now think that we weren’t really in a position to do that as a company that sold consultations to individual patients. Many of the improvements in systematization that were clearly “good buys” have, in fact, been implemented in hospitals since Gawande and Gigerenzer first wrote about them.  We never saw a clear-cut case of a patient whose doctors had “dropped the ball” by giving them an obviously wrong treatment, except where the patient was facing financial hardship and had to transfer to substandard medical care.  I think doctors don’t make true unforced errors in diagnosis or treatment plan that often; and medical errors like “operating on the wrong leg” that happen in fast-paced decisionmaking environments were necessarily outside our scope.  I think there <em>might </em>be an opportunity to do a lot better than baseline by building a “smart hospital” that runs on checklists, statistical prediction rules, outcomes monitoring, and other evidence-based practices — <a href=""https://intermountainhealthcare.org/about/"">Intermountain</a> is the closest thing I know about, and they <em>do </em>get great outcomes — but that’s an epically hard problem, it’s political as much as medical and technological, and we weren’t in a position to make any headway on it.</p>
<p><strong>AI Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>We were <em>also </em>hoping to automate diagnosis and treatment planning in a personalized manner.  “Given your symptoms, demographics, and genetic &amp; lab test data, and given published research on epidemiology and clinical experiments, what are the most likely candidate diagnoses for you, and what are the treatments most likely to be effective for you?”</p>
<p>I used to be a big believer in the potential of this approach, but in the process of actually trying to build the AI, I ran into <a href=""https://srconstantin.wordpress.com/2015/04/30/choice-of-ontology/"">obstacles which were fundamentally philosophical.</a> (No, it’s not “machines don’t have empathy” or anything like that.  It’s about the irreducible dependence on how you frame the problem, which makes “expert systems” dependent on an impractical, expensive amount of human labor up front.)</p>
<p><b>Connecting Patients with Experimental Therapies</b></p>
<p>Yet another “personalized medicine” problem we were trying to solve is the fact that patients with incurable diseases have a hard time learning about and getting access to experimental therapies, and could use a consultant who would guide them through the process and help get them into studies of new treatments.</p>
<p>I still think this is a real and serious problem for patients, and potentially an opportunity for entrepreneurs.  (Either on the consulting model, or more on the software side, via creating tools for matching patients with clinical trials — since clinical trials <em>also </em>struggle to recruit patients.)  In order to focus on this model, though, we’d have had to invest a lot more than we did into high-touch relationships with patients and building a network of clinician-researchers we could connect them with.</p>
<p><strong>When Standard Practice Doesn’t Match Scientific Evidence</strong></p>
<p>One kind of “medical error” we <em>did </em>see on occasion was when the patient’s doctors are dutifully doing the treatment that’s “standard-of-care”, but the medical literature actually shows that the standard-of-care is <em>wrong</em>.</p>
<p>There are cases where large, well-conducted studies clearly show that treatment A and treatment B have the same efficacy but B has worse side effects, and yet, “first-line treatment” is B for some reason.</p>
<p>There are cases where there’s a <em>lot </em>of evidence that “standard” cut-offs are in the wrong place. “Subclinical hypothyroidism” still benefits from supplemental thyroid hormone; higher-than-standard doses of allopurinol control gout better; “standard” light therapy for seasonal affective disorder doesn’t work as well as ultra-bright lights; etc.  <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/12/02/more-dakka/"">More Dakka.</a></p>
<p>There are also cases where a scientist found an intervention effective, and published a striking result, and maybe it was even publicized widely in places like the <em>New Yorker </em>or <em>Wired,</em> but somehow clinicians never picked it up.  The classic example is <a href=""https://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2009/05/ramachandrans_mirror.html"">Ramachandran’s mirror box experiment</a> — it’s a famous experiment that showed that phantom limb pain can be reversed by creating an illusion with mirrors that allows the patient to fix their “body map.” There have since been quite a few randomized trials confirming that the mirror trick works. But, maybe because it’s not a typical kind of “treatment” like a drug, it’s <em>not </em>standard of care for phantom limb pain.</p>
<p>I think we were pretty successful at finding these kinds of mismatches between medical science and medical practice.  By their nature, though, these kinds of solutions are hard to scale to reach lots of people.</p>
<p><strong>N=1 Translational Medicine for Rare Diseases</strong></p>
<p>This is the use case of “personalized medicine” that I think can really shine.  It harnesses the incredible motivation of patients with rare incurable diseases and their family members; it’s one of the few cases where genetic data really does make a huge difference; and the path to scale is (relatively) obvious if you discover a new drug or treatment.  I think we should have focused much more tightly on this angle, and that a company based on bench-to-bedside discovery for rare diseases could still<em> </em>become the real-world “Durona Group”.</p>
<p>I think doing it right at MetaMed would have meant getting a lot more in-house expertise in biology and medicine than we ever had, more like Perlara and Q-State, which have their own experimental research programs, something we never got off the ground.</p>
<p>Speaking only about myself and not my teammates, while I was at MetaMed I was deeply <em>embarrassed </em>to be a layman in the biomedical field, and I felt like “why would an expert ever want to work with a layman like me?” So I was far too reluctant to reach out to prominent biologists and doctors. I now know that <em>experts work with laymen all the time</em>, especially when that layman brings strategic vision, funding, and logistical/operational manpower, and listens to the expert with genuine curiosity.  Laymen are valuable — just ask <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Lasker"">Mary Lasker!</a>  I really wish I’d understood this at the time.</p>
<p>People overestimate progress in the short run and underestimate it in the long run.  “Biohackers” and “citizen science” and “N=1 experimentation” have been around for a while, but they haven’t, I think, gotten very far along towards the ultimate impact they’re likely to have in the future.  Naively, that can look a lot like “a few people tried that and it didn’t seem to go anywhere” when the situation is actually “the big break is still ahead of us.”</p>",,sarahconstantin,sarahconstantin,sarahconstantin

<p>Last month I finally got round to reading <em>The Eureka Factor</em> by John Kounios and Mark Beeman, a popular book summarising research on 'insightful' thinking. I first mentioned it <a href=""https://drossbucket.wordpress.com/2017/05/16/two-types-of-mathematician-yet-again/"">a couple of years ago</a> after I'd read a <a href=""https://www.wired.co.uk/article/eureka-moment-cognitive-psychology-john-kounios"">short summary article</a>, when I realised it was directly relevant to my recurring 'two types of mathematician' obsession:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The book is not focussed on maths – it’s a general interest book about problem solving and creativity in any domain. But it looks like it has a very similar way of splitting problem solvers into two groups, ‘insightfuls’ and ‘analysts’. ‘Analysts’ follow a linear, methodical approach to work through a problem step by step. Importantly, they also have cognitive access to those steps – if they’re asked what they did to solve the problem, they can reconstruct the argument.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>‘Insightfuls’ have no such access to the way they solved the problem. Instead, a solution just ‘pops into their heads’.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Of course, nobody is really a pure ‘insightful’ or ‘analyst’. And most significant problems demand a mixed strategy. But it does seem like many people have a tendency towards one or the other.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wasn't too sure what I was getting into. The replication crisis has made me hyperaware of the dangers of uncritically accepting any results in psychology, and I'm way too ignorant of the field to have a good sense for which results still look plausible. However, the book turned out to be so extraordinarily Relevant To My Interests that I couldn't resist writing up a review anyway.</p>
<p>The final chapters had a few examples along the lines of '[weak environmental effect] primes people to be more/less insightful', and I know enough to stay away from those, but the earlier parts look somewhat more solid to me. I haven't made much effort to trace back references, though, and I could easily still be being too credulous.</p>
<p>(I didn't worry so much about replication with my <a href=""https://drossbucket.wordpress.com/2018/12/12/the-bat-and-ball-problem-revisited/"">previous post</a> on the Cognitive Reflection Test. Getting the bat and ball question wrong is hardly the kind of weak effect that you need a sensitive statistical instrument to detect. It's almost impossible to <em>stop</em> people getting it wrong! I did steer clear of any more dubious priming-style results, though, like the claim that people do better on the CRT when reading it 'in a disfluent font'.)</p>
<h1>Insight and intuition</h1>
<p>First, it's worth getting clear on exactly what Kounious and Beeman mean by 'insight'. As they use it, insight is a specific type of creative thinking, which they define more generally as 'the ability to reinterpret something by breaking it down into its elements and recombining these elements in a surprising way to achieve some goal.' Insight is distinguished by its suddenness and lack of conscious control:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When this kind of creative recombination takes place in an instant, it’s an insight. But recombination can also result from the more gradual, conscious process that cognitive psychologists call “analytic” thought. This involves methodically and deliberately considering many possibilities until you find the solution. For example, when you’re playing a game of Scrabble, you must construct words from sets of letters. When you look at the set of letters “A-E-H-I-P-N-Y-P” and suddenly realize that they can form the word “EPIPHANY,” then that would be an insight. When you systematically try out different combinations of the letters until you find the word, that’s analysis.</p>

<p>Insights tend to have a few other features in common. Solving a problem by insight is normally very satisfying: the insight comes into consciousness along with a small jolt of positive affect. The insight itself is usually preceded by a longer period of more effortful thought about the problem. Sometimes this takes place just before the moment of insight, while at other times there is an 'incubation' phase, where the solution pops into your head while you've taken a break from deliberately thinking about it.</p>
<p>I'm not really going to get into this part in my review, but the related word 'intuition' is also used in an interestingly specific sense in the book, to describe the sense that a new idea is lurking beneath the surface, but is not consciously accessible yet. Intuitions often precede an insight, but have a different feel to the insight itself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This puzzling phenomenon has a strange subjective quality. It feels like an idea is about to burst into your consciousness, almost as though you’re about to sneeze. Cognitive psychologists call this experience “intuition,” meaning an awareness of the presence of information in the unconscious mind — a new idea, solution, or perspective — without awareness of the information itself, at least until it pops into consciousness.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>Insight problems</h1>
<p>To study insight, psychologists need to come up with problems that reliably trigger an insight solution. One classic example discussed in <em>The Eureka Factor</em> is the Nine Dot Problem, where you are asked to connect the following 3 by 3 grid of black dots using only four lines, without retracing or taking your pen off the page:</p>
<p><img src=""https://drossbucket.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/9dots.png?w=207&amp;h=207&amp;zoom=2"" alt=""Image alt-text""></p>
<p>If you've somehow avoided seeing this puzzle before, think about it for a while first. I've put the solution and my discussion of it in a spoiler block below:</p>
<div class=""spoiler"">
<p>A solution can be found in the Wikipedia article on insight problems <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eureka_effect#Insight_problems_and_problems_with_insight"">here</a>. It'll probably look irritatingly obvious once you see it. The key feature of the solution is that the lines you draw have to extend outside the confines of the square of dots you start with (thus spawning a whole subgenre of annoying business literature on 'thinking outside the box'). Nothing in the rules forbids this, but the setup focusses most people's attention on the grid itself, and breaking out of this mindset requires a kind of reframing, a throwing away of artificially imposed constraints. This is a common characteristic of insight problems.</p>
<p>This characteristic also makes insight hard to test. For testing purposes, it's useful to have a large stock of similar puzzles in hand. But a good reframing like the one in the Nine Dot Problem tends to be a bit of a one-off: once you've had the idea of extending the lines outside the box, it applies trivially to all similar puzzles, and not at all to other types of puzzle.</p>
<p>(I talked about something similar in my <a href=""https://drossbucket.wordpress.com/2018/12/12/the-bat-and-ball-problem-revisited/"">last post</a>, on the Cognitive Reflection Test. The test was inspired by one good puzzle, the 'bat and ball problem', and adds two other questions that were apparently picked to be similar. Five thousand words and many comments later, it's not obvious to me or most of the other commenters that these three problems form any kind of natural set at all.)</p>
</div>
<p>Kounios and Beeman discuss several of these eyecatching 'one-off' problems in the book, but their own research that they discuss is focussed on a more standardisable kind of puzzle, the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_Associates_Test"">Remote Associates Test</a>. This test gives you three words, such as</p>
<p>PINE
CRAB
SAUCE</p>
<p>and asks you to find the common word that links them. The authors claim that these can be solved either with or without insight, and asked participants to self-categorise their responses as either fitting in the 'insightful' or 'analytic' categories:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The analytic approach is to consciously search through the possibilities and try out potential answers. For example, start with “pine.” Imagine yourself thinking: What goes with “pine”? Perhaps “tree”? “Pine tree” works. “Crab tree”? Hmmm … maybe. “Tree sauce”? No. Have to try something else. How about “cake”? “Crab cake” works. “Cake sauce” is a bit of a reach but might be acceptable. However, “pine cake” and “cake pine” definitely don’t work. What else? How about “crabgrass”? That works. But “pine grass”? Not sure. Perhaps there is such a thing. But “sauce grass” and “grass sauce” are definitely out. What else goes with “sauce”? How about “applesauce”? That’s good. “Pineapple” and “crab apple” also work. The answer is “apple”!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This is analytical thought: a deliberate, methodical, conscious search through the possible combinations. But this isn’t the only way to come up with the solution. Perhaps you’re trying out possibilities and get stuck or even draw a blank. And then, “Aha! Apple” suddenly pops into your awareness. That’s what would happen if you solved the problem by insight. The solution just occurs to you and doesn’t seem to be a direct product of your ongoing stream of thought.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This categorisation seems suspiciously neat, and if I rely on my own introspection for solving one of these (which is obviously dubious itself) it feels like more of a mix. I'll often generate some verbal noise about cakes and trees that sounds vaguely like I'm doing something systematic, but the main business of solving the thing seems to be going on nonverbally elsewhere. But I do think there's <em>something</em> there – the answer can be very immediate and 'poppy', or it can surface after a longer and more accessible process of trying plausible words. This was tested in a more objective way by seeing what people do when they <em>don't</em> come up with the answer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Insightfuls made more “errors of omission.” When waiting for an insight that hadn’t yet arrived, they had nothing to offer in its place. So when the insight didn’t arrive in time, they let the clock run out without having made a guess. In contrast, Analysts made more “errors of commission.” They rarely timed out, but instead guessed – sometimes correctly – by offering the potential solution they had been consciously thinking about when their time was almost up.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Kounios and Beeman's research focussed on finding neural correlates of the 'aha' moment of insight, using a combination of an EEG test to pinpoint the time of the insight, and fMRI scanning to locate the brain region:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We found that at the moment a solution pops into someone’s awareness as an insight, a sudden burst of high-frequency EEG activity known as “gamma waves” can be picked up by electrodes just above the right ear. (Gamma waves represent cognitive processing in the brain, such as paying attention to something or linking together different pieces of information.) We were amazed at the abruptness of this burst of activity—just what one would expect from a sudden insight. Functional magnetic resonance imaging showed a corresponding increase in blood flow under these electrodes in a part of the brain’s right temporal lobe called the “anterior superior temporal gyrus” (see figure 5.2), an area that is involved in making connections between distantly related ideas, as in jokes and metaphors. This activity was absent for analytic solutions.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So we had found a neural signature of the aha moment: a burst of activity in the brain’s right hemisphere.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not sure how settled this is, though. I haven't tried to do a proper search of the literature, but certainly a <a href=""http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.477.3047&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf"">review</a> from 2010 describes the situation as very much in flux:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A recent surge of interest into the neural underpinnings of creative behavior has produced a banquet of data that is tantalizing but, considered as a whole, deeply self-contradictory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(The book was published somewhat later, in 2015, but mostly cites research from prior to this review, such as <a href=""https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0020097"">this paper</a>.)</p>
<p>As an outsider it's going to be pretty hard for me to judge this without spending a <em>lot</em> more time than I really want to right now. However, regardless of how this holds up, I was really interested in the authors' discussion of <em>why</em> a right-hemisphere neural correlate of insight would make sense.</p>
<h1>Insight and context</h1>
<p>One of the authors, Mark Beeman, had <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8467379"">previously studied</a> language deficits in people who had suffered brain damage to the right hemisphere. One such patient was the trial attorney D.B.:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What made D.B. “lucky” was that the stroke had damaged his right hemisphere rather than his left. Had the stroke occurred in the mirror-image left-hemisphere region, he would have experienced Wernicke’s aphasia, a profound deficit of language comprehension. In the worst cases, people with Wernicke’s aphasia may be completely unable to understand written or spoken language.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Nevertheless, D.B. didn’t feel lucky. He may have been better off than if he’d had a left-hemisphere stroke, but he felt that his language ability was far from normal. He said that he “couldn’t keep up” with conversations or stories the way he used to. He felt impaired enough that he had stopped litigating trials—he thought that it would have been a disservice to his clients to continue to represent them in court.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>D.B. and the other patients were able to understand the straightforward meanings of words and the literal meanings of sentences. Even so, they complained about vague difficulties with language. They failed to grasp the gist of stories or were unable to follow multiple-character or multiple-plot stories, movies, or television shows. Many didn’t get jokes. Sarcasm and irony left them blank with incomprehension. They could sometimes muddle along without these abilities, but whenever things became subtle or implicit, they were lost.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An example of the kind of problem D.B. struggled with is the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Saturday, Joan went to the park by the lake. She was walking barefoot in the shallow water, not knowing that there was glass nearby. Suddenly, she grabbed her foot in pain and called for help, and the lifeguard came running.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If D.B. was given a statement about something that occurred explicitly in the text, such as 'Joan went to the park on Saturday', he could say whether it was true or false with no problems at all. In fact, he did better than all of the control subjects on these sorts of explicit questions. But if he was instead presented with a statement like 'Joan cut her foot', where some of the facts are left implicit, he was unable to answer.</p>
<p>This was interesting to me, because it seems so directly relevant to the <a href=""https://drossbucket.wordpress.com/2018/04/08/the-cognitive-decoupling-elite/"">discussion</a> <a href=""https://everythingstudies.com/2018/05/25/decoupling-revisited/"">last year</a> on 'cognitive decoupling'. This is a term I'd picked up from <a href=""https://srconstantin.wordpress.com/2014/06/09/do-rationalists-exist/"">Sarah Constantin</a>, who herself got it from Keith Stanovich:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stanovich talks about “cognitive decoupling”, the ability to block out context and experiential knowledge and just follow formal rules, as a main component of both performance on intelligence tests and performance on the cognitive bias tests that correlate with intelligence. Cognitive decoupling is the opposite of holistic thinking. It’s the ability to separate, to view things in the abstract, to play devil’s advocate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The patients in Beeman's study have so much difficulty with contextualisation that they struggle with anything at all that is left implicit, even straightforward inferences like 'Joan cut her foot'. This appears to match with other evidence from <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11126944"">visual half-field studies</a>, where subjects are presented with words on either the right or left half of the visual field. Those on the left half will go first to the right hemisphere, so that the right hemisphere gets a head start on interpreting the stimulus. This shows a similar difference between hemispheres:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The left hemisphere is sharp, focused, and discriminating. When a word is presented to the left hemisphere, the meaning of that word is activated along with the meanings of a few closely related words. For example, when the word “table” is presented to the left hemisphere, this might strongly energize the concepts “chair” and “kitchen,” the usual suspects, so to speak. In contrast, the right hemisphere is broad, fuzzy, and promiscuously inclusive. When “table” is presented to the right hemisphere, a larger number of remotely related words are weakly invoked. For example, “table” might activate distant associations such as “water” (for underground water table), “payment” (for paying under the table), “number” (for a table of numbers), and so forth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why would picking up on these weak associations be relevant to insight? The story seems to be that this tangle of secondary meanings - the <a href=""https://twitter.com/Meaningness/status/1059189937973551104"">'Lovecraftian penumbra of monstrous shadow phalanges'</a> - works to pull your attention away from the obvious interpretation you're stuck with, helping you to find a clever new reframing of the problem.</p>
<p>This makes a lot of sense to me as a rough outline. In my own experience at least, the kind of thinking that is likely to lead to an insight experience feels softer and more diffuse than the more 'analytic' kind, more a process of sort of rolling the ideas around gently in your head and seeing if something clicks than a really focussed investigation of the problem. 'Thinking too hard' tends to break the spell. This fits well with the idea that insights are triggered by activation of weak associations.</p>
<h1>Final thoughts</h1>
<p>There's a lot of other interesting material in the book about the rest of the insight process, including the incubation period leading up to an insight flash, and the phenomenon of 'intuitions', where you feel that an insight is on its way but you don't know what it is yet. I'll never get through this review if I try to cover all of that, so instead I'm going to finish up with a couple of weak associations of my own that got activated while reading the book.</p>
<p>I've been getting increasingly dissatisfied with the way <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_process_theory"">dual process theories</a> split cognition into a fast/automatic/intuitive 'System 1' and a slow/effortful/systematic 'System 2'. System 1 in particular has started to look to me like an amorphous grab bag of all kinds of things that would be better separated out.</p>
<p><em>The Eureka Factor</em> has pushed this a little further, by bringing out a distinction between two things that normally get lumped under System 1 but are actually very different. One obvious type of System 1-ish behaviour is routine action, the way you go about tasks you have done many times before, like making a sandwich or walking to work. These kinds of activities require very little explicit thought and generally 'just happen' in response to cues in the environment.</p>
<p>The kind of 'insightful' thinking discussed in <em>The Eureka Factor</em> would also normally get classed under System 1: it's not very systematic and involves a fast, opaque process where the answer just pops into your head without much explanation. But it's also very different to routine action. It involves deliberately choosing to think about a <em>new</em> situation, rather than one you have seen many times before, and a successful insight gives you a qualitatively new kind of understanding. The insight flash itself is a very noticeable, enjoyable feature of your conscious attention, rather than the effortless, unexamined state of absorbed action.</p>
<p>This was pointed out to me once before by Sarah Constantin, in the comments section of her <a href=""https://srconstantin.wordpress.com/2017/10/10/distinctions-in-types-of-thought/#comment-2779"">Distinctions in Types of Thought</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You seem to be lumping “flashes of insight” in with “effortless flow-state”. I don’t think they’re the same. For one thing, inspiration generally comes in bursts, while flow-states can persist for a while (driving on a highway, playing the piano, etc.) Definitely, “flashes of insight” aren’t the same type of thought as “effortful attention” — insight feels easy, instant, and unforced. But they might be their own, unique category of thought. Still working out my ontology here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'd sort of had this at the back of my head since then, but the book has really brought out the distinction clearly. I'm sure these aren't the only types of thinking getting shoved into the System 1 category, and I get the sense that there's a lot more splitting out that I need to do.</p>
<p>I also thought about how the results in the book fit in with my perennial 'two types of mathematician' question. (This is a weird phenomenon I've noticed where a lot of mathematicians have written essays about how mathematicians can be divided into two groups; I've assembled a list of examples <a href=""https://drossbucket.wordpress.com/2018/11/18/two-types-of-mathematician/"">here</a>.) 'Analytic' versus 'insightful' seems to be <em>one</em> of the distinctions between groups, at least. It seems relevant to Poincaré’s version, for instance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The one sort are above all preoccupied with logic; to read their works, one is tempted to believe they have advanced only step by step, after the manner of a Vauban who pushes on his trenches against the place besieged, leaving nothing to chance.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The other sort are guided by intuition and at the first stroke make quick but sometimes precarious conquests, like bold cavalrymen of the advance guard.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In fact, Poincaré once also gave a <a href=""http://www.math.harvard.edu/~ctm/home/text/class/harvard/275/05/html/poincare.html"">striking description</a> of an insight flash himself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just at this time, I left Caen, where I was living, to go on a geologic excursion under the auspices of the School of Mines. The incidents of the travel made me forget my mathematical work. Having reached Coutances, we entered an omnibus to go some place or other. At the moment when I put my foot on the step, the idea came to me, without anything in my former thoughts seeming to have paved the way for it, that the transformations I had used to define the Fuchsian functions were identical with those of non-Euclidean geometry. I did not verify the idea; I should not have had time, as, upon taking my seat in the omnibus, I went on with a conversation already commenced, but I felt a perfect certainty. On my return to Caen, for conscience' sake, I verified the result at my leisure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the insight/analysis split is going to be relevant here, it would require that people favour either 'analytic' or 'insight' solutions as a general cognitive style, rather than switching between them freely depending on the problem. The authors do indeed claim that this is the case:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most people can, and to some extent do, use both of these approaches. A pure type probably doesn’t exist; each person falls somewhere on an analytic-insightful continuum. Yet many—perhaps most—people tend to gravitate toward one of these styles, finding their particular approach to be more comfortable or natural.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is based on their own <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17765273"">research</a> where they recorded participant's self-report of whether they were using a 'insight' or 'analytic' approach to solve anagrams, and compared it with EEG recordings of their resting state. They found a number of differences, including more right-hemisphere activity in the 'insight' group, and lower levels of communication between the frontal lobe and other parts of the brain, indicating a more disorderly thinking style with less top-down control. This may suggest more freedom to allow weak associations between thoughts to have a crack at the problem, without being overruled by the dominant interpretation.</p>
<p>Again, and you're probably got very bored of this disclaimer, I have no idea how well the details of this will hold up. That's true for pretty much every specific detail in the book that I've discussed here. Still, the link between insight and weak associations makes a lot of sense to me, and the overall picture certainly triggered some useful reframings. That seems very appropriate for a book about insight.</p>

<p>For example, if <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""x_i""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">x</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mi"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">i</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> were temperature (as in <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/EEPdbtvW8ei9Yi2e8/bridging-syntax-and-semantics-empirically"">this post</a>), then an AI could deduce temperature information from human sensory data <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/EEPdbtvW8ei9Yi2e8/bridging-syntax-and-semantics-empirically"">much better</a> than our subjective ""it feels kinda hot/cold in here"".</p>

For algorithms, we could look at named variables within them. For humans, we could also look at variables that correspond to names or labels (for example, when you ask a human ""are you feeling hot?"", what parts of the brain are triggered when that question is asked, and what parts correspond to the articulated answer being ""yes"").</p>
<p>Unless we are specifically interested in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_act"">speech acts</a>, we can't just say ""<span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""X_i""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base"" style=""margin-right: -0.024em;""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.024em;"">X</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mi"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">i</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> corresponds to the human answering 'yes' when asked about how hot they feel"". Nevertheless, when attempting to define a ""feeling of hotness"" variable, we should be defining it with all our knowledge (and the human's knowledge) of what that means: for example the fact that humans often answer 'yes' to that question when they indeed do feel hot.</p>

<p>Things can get more murky if we allow for unconscious feelings. Suppose someone has a relatively accurate gut instinct as to whether other people are trustworthy, but barely makes use of that instinct consciously. Then it's tricky to decide whether that instinct is a natural internal variable (which is highly correlated with trustworthiness), or an input into the human's conscious estimate (which is weakly correlated with trustworthiness).</p>
<h2>Investigation, not optimisation</h2>
<p>So this method is very suitable for <strong>checking</strong> the correlations between internal variables and external ones, variables that we have defined though some other process. So it can answer questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>""Is a human's subjective feeling of heat a good estimate of temperature?"" (not really).</li>
<li>""Is a trained human's temperature guess a good estimate of temperature?"" (somewhat).</li>
<li>""Is a human's subjective feeling of there being someone else in the room a good estimate of the presence of an intruder""? (yes, very much so).</li>
<li>""Does this brain activity mean that the human detects an intruder?"" (possibly).</li>
</ul>
<p>But it <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law"">all falls apart</a> if we try and use the correlation as an optimisation measure, shifting <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""X_i""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base"" style=""margin-right: -0.024em;""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.024em;"">X</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mi"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">i</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> to better measure <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""x_i""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">x</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mi"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">i</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> or vice-versa.</p>

<p>It is, however, pretty easy to fool the door alarm: simply go through a window.

<p>The human guard is hard to fool in either direction. We humans are very good at figuring out when other humans are around, so, assuming the guard is moderately attentive, tricking the guard in either direction requires a lot of work - though it is probably easier to trigger a false positive (the guard mistakenly thinks that there's a person in the greenhouse) than a false negative (the guard doesn't notice someone actually in the greenhouse). Confusing or overwhelming the guard becomes possible for intelligent adversaries.

<p>The resourceful human is even harder to fool, because they have all the advantages of the guard, plus any extra precautions they may have taken (such as adding alarms, cameras, crowds of onlookers, etc...).

<p>But none of the inclusions are strict. If someone sprays the heat-sensitive camera but then walks in through the door, the door-alarm will detect the intrusion even as the camera misses it. If someone disguises themselves as a table, they might be able to fool the guard but be caught by the camera. The resourceful human has their own personality, so there might be some manipulation of them that would fall flat for the guard.</p>

<p>Since no computable agent can have a perfect correlation with the variable in question, there is a sense in which no symbol can be perfectly grounded (this gets even more obvious when you start slicing into the definition, and start wondering about the meanings of ""human"" and ""a certain greenhouse"" in <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""x""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">x</span></span></span></span></span></span>).</p>
<p>But, despite the lack of perfect inclusion and perfect correlation, there is a strong sense in which the later agents are better correlated than the earlier ones. Assume that we have a sensible computer language to pick a complexity prior in, and update on the world being roughly as we believe it to be.

The Blue minimising robot series completely changed how I thought about myself and cleared up a lot of the confusions that I had about myself (e.g. what I would now call akrasia). I would say that, personally, dual process theory is the most useful thing that I have learnt under the umbrella of rationality.</p><p>I have frequently wondered how different my life would have been had I understood myself better at an early age. How would one go about explaining this to a 6 year old?</p><p>I have two children (6 and 4) and had tried to explain a bit about the 2 systems to them but with limited success. I particularly thought it would help my eldest as he can struggle behaviourally and experiences extreme emotions but he didn’t fully internalise what system 1 / system 2 meant. Then I heard that Prof Steve Peters had released a children’s book based on his chimp model and I was intrigued enough to get it for him as a Christmas present.</p><p>[note that there is a companion book to My Hidden Chimp called The Silent Guides which is aimed more at parents but which I haven’t read]</p><h1>The Author</h1><p>I’m not sure how well known Peters is outside the UK but over here he is a minor celebrity. For most people I suspect that if I mentioned Peters by name they wouldn’t know who I was talking about. If I said “You know, that sports psychiatrist who works with cyclists, the chimp guy” then they probably would.</p><p>He is probably most famous for his work with British cycling as part of their programme of incremental gains. Most recently was in the news for being <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/sport/cycling/46970230"">credited by Victoria Pendleton</a> for preventing her suicide. </p><p>He has also worked with Ronnie O’Sullivan which was where I first noticed his work. Prior to working with Peters, O’Sullivan struggled with drink, drugs and depression but in recent years has turned this around, giving Peters a lot of the credit.</p><p>He is also an age group world champion in 100, 200 and 400m.</p><p>I’m not his publicist, honest...</p><h1>The Chimp Model</h1><p>The <a href=""https://chimpmanagement.com/the-chimp-model/"">chimp model</a> is Peters’ dual process metaphor. Different writers and models seem to me to have subtly different focuses - e.g. Robin’s Elephant and rider focuses on motivation, Kahneman’s system 1 and system 2 on decision making. The chimp model in My Hidden Chimp focuses on fast, emotional responses.</p><p>An adult explanation of the chimp model is given in Peters’ previous book The Chimp Paradox. The Chimp model is expressed as the human (frontal lobe, a.k.a blue brain) and the chimp (limbic system, a.k.a red brain). My Hidden Chimp goes into less depth but explains how a chimp has a very small blue blue brain so it mainly decides things with its red brain, hence calling it your chimp. The human (blue brain, “You”) is the you that you really want to be.</p><p>[The Chimp Paradox (which I also haven’t read) goes into a triple process theory by adding the computer which stores and acts on memories. This isn’t mentioned in My Hidden Chimp, I presume because it is a simplified version for children.]</p><h1>The Book</h1><h2>Structure</h2><p>In the first third of the book, the chimp model is introduced, explained and made relevant with examples. The remainder of the book describes 10 habits which help us to manage our chimp and how to build the habits into our life.</p><h2>Teaching methods</h2><p>As you might expect from a children’s book, it is full of brightly coloured pictures.</p><p>The examples in the book are 4 children and their chimps in various different circumstances where the human thinks one thing and the chimp is thinking something else. For instance you want to go for a walk but your chimp wants to stay at home and do nothing or you know that you’re safe in bed but the chimp is scared of the dark. The examples given are wide ranging so that readers will recognise themselves in some of the characters. The chimps are given names (readers name their own chimp too) and are often presented humourously.</p><p>This is probably the best thing about the book. We had many moments of self-recognition as we read it, as did other people who I’ve heard talk about it.</p><p>In addition to the examples, there are exercises throughout the book, for instance listing times where you’ve acted in a way that you wish you hadn’t. These help with applying the lessons and to building commitment to act on the lessons.</p><h2>Section 1 - Chimp model</h2><p>The first section of the book gives a brief introduction to dual process theory and the chimp model in particular. It introduces the 4 characters and their chimps and gives examples of what they’re thinking.</p><p>The book tries to avoid some problems otential pitfalls, for instance explaining that your chimp is part of you so you can’t just blame it when you do something naughty. You have to make sure it behaves itself like you would with a pet.</p><h2>Section 2 - Habits</h2><p>The second section explains 10 habits which help manage your chimp. These are some of the basic building blocks that you’ve probably told your children about 100 times (learning to share, learning that no means no, saying sorry). Talking about them in the context of our hidden chimp works well to show why they find them hard to do but also why they are important.</p><h2>Age range</h2><p>The book doesn’t give a recommended age range but a lower bound would be the ability to understand and act on dual process theory when explained in an age relevant way. The upper bound would probably be not feeling patronised by the childish cartoon drawings. 5-10 is a fair guideline.</p><p>The book states that it can be read by the child on their own or with an adult. I would suggest that (for younger readers especially) the book should be read with an adult as I feel misunderstanding the content could have negative effects.</p><h1>Potential Criticisms</h1><p>Here I cover not only some of my own criticisms but also some criticisms which I expect other rationalists might have, even if I think the book deals fairly well with most of the issues.</p><h2>Explanation of the chimp</h2><p>I found the explanation of the chimp slightly confusing. The original explanation makes it sounds superficially as though it is the part of you which makes you do naughty things. This pivots to the part of you that is “acting without your permission”. This is slightly vague but the book makes up for this with repeated extensional definition, giving examples to indicate the kind of thing which it is talking about. Extensional definition seems like the right way to go about explaining it to a child so overall I think this works fairly well.</p><p>I should note that re-reading the book it is fairly clear what it means from the beginning yet somehow I (and others) found it confusing on first reading - go figure.</p><p>It’s important to mention that Peters’ chimp is not exactly analogous to my mental model of system 1 - my impression is that the chimp is a more narrow framing. The Chimp includes immediate, emotional, visible responses. It doesn’t include other opaque subconscious processes such as those which deal with long term motivation. It is possible that the Chimp Paradox deals with these other issues but the focus of MHC is firmly on short term emotional actions. </p><p>This probably makes sense as a children’s book as when we are young we tend to be more short term and react emotionally so learning to deal with these parts of our mind seems like the priority.</p><h2>Identifying with system 2</h2><p>This leads on to another potential problem. I suspect that <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NJL5FYe6KkRtjekeG/are-you-the-rider-or-the-elephant"">some</a> <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/XmqqkfY8XAJ6LkwdP/akrasia-is-confusion-about-what-you-want"">people</a> might be unhappy with the book’s framing of your system 2 being the you that you really want to be and your system 1 being the part of you that acts without your permission. I’ve seen similar criticism of the Chimp Paradox.</p><p>Personally, I found that this worked well as a children’s book and would worry that a more nuanced framing would confuse matters. I intend to go into the rest of the story when my children are older, a bit like I’d teach a child Newtonian mechanics first and wait until they’re older to explain relativity.</p><p>I would understand if others took a different point of view (I’m not 100% convinced mysel) so I’ve just described it and will let you decide how happy you would be with the framing given. </p><p>The fact that the chimp is a more narrow framing than the elephant might help assuage some worries but I’m not sure. There is a concerted effort to describe how our chimps can sometimes be helpful – e.g. our chimp helps us to have fun and warns us of danger. The often-humourous presentation of the chimps also helps with appreciating the chimp. </p><p>However, the book also presents us as having to put our chimps in a box when they are misbehaving. The examples given in the book are of circumstances where the chimp is having a negative effect on our lives (not sharing, telling lies to parents, being unkind to friends). I’ll grant that there are edge cases where these actions might be beneficial but, especially for a child, the advice to prevent our chimps from doing these things overall seems like the right way to go.</p><h2>Taking the metaphor literally</h2><p>Dual process theory is a model of something much more complicated. We are not two people or a single person with a limbic system attached. Our brain is a big mass of neurons and connections of which we only understand a very general picture. Peters deals with this by stating carefully that this is just an interesting way to think of how our brains work and not reality. However, for most of the book he just writes as if the model is literally true. This can seem slightly odd but I suspect that it is better than the alternative of constantly qualifying every statement. I just ended up having to remind my son that it was a model every time I thought he might be taking it too literally.</p><h2>Book not matching life</h2><p>One particularly interesting experience was talking about the habit of sharing. Peters presents this as our human wanting to share and our chimp not wanting to share. My son pointed out that actually he and his chimp and were in agreement that they didn’t want to share. I don’t know how common this would be but I’d tend to agree with my son that my system 2 by default (especially when I was younger) doesn’t particularly want to share. </p><p>I suspect that there’s not much a book can do about this and that it’s a case of adding your own explanation to the book where it doesn’t exactly meet what the child needs. In this case, I reminded my son about “cooperate or defect?” (as we call Prisoners Dilemna) and how cooperating often means a better result in the end. This is part of the reason I’d recommend the book being read with an adult - customisation.</p><h2>Other</h2><p>The main critical comments from online reviews seem to be:</p><p>Too young for my child (~12 is too old)</p><p>The 10 habits are things you’re teaching your child anyway - nothing original</p><p>Kindle version is poor</p><h1>Did it work?</h1><p>Yes.</p><p>Obviously I have to add the usual caveats that it’s only a sample of 1, perhaps its regression towards the mean, maybe the other things I’ve been working on with my son have made a difference.</p><p>Even given that, I am confident that he has understood dual process theory as presented in the book and started to recognise when his chimp “takes over”. As a result, he is more able to e.g. stop himself when he gets angry or to override his instincts not to share. Reading it with him has also given us a common framework to talk about what went wrong when he has lost control. </p><p>Before reading the book I could often see how his mind was working when he did lose control and could tell that he was desperately searching for ways that he could still be in the right. Then afterwards you could see how confused he was with himself and he couldn’t figure out why he’d done what he did. Now he feels like he understands what went wrong and how he can do better next time.</p><p>He has avoided the obvious pitfall of just blaming his chimp and, if anything, is better at taking responsibility for his actions.</p><p>So throughout this review I have had to prevent myself from just saying “THIS BOOK IS AMAZING AND ANYONE WITH A 5-10 YEAR OLD CHILD SHOULD BUY IT IMMEDIATELY!”.</p><p>I realise that it is likely that it may not work quite as well with every child. The book could have been written with my son in mind so if it was going to work for anyone it was going to work for him.</p><p>You can make up your own mind if you think it will work for your family.</p>",,Bucky,bucky,Bucky

However, humans give answers that are limited, biased and often in disagreement with each other, and so AI safety needs social scientists to figure out how to improve this data - which eventually may be gathered from thousands or millions of people. Of particular importance is the ability to design rigorous experiments, drawing from an interdisciplinary understanding of human cognition and behaviour. The authors discuss <u><a href=""https://blog.openai.com/debate/"">Debate</a></u> (<u><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/0ae5d69de63b/alignment-newsletter-5"">AN #5</a></u>) as a case study of a safety technique whose success depends on empirical questions such as: how skilled are humans as judges by default? Can we train people to be better judges? Are there ways to restrict debate to make it easier to judge?</p><p>There are a couple of key premises underlying this argument. The first is that, despite human biases, there are correct answers to questions about human values - perhaps defined as the answer we would endorse if given all relevant information and unlimited time to think. However, it’s not necessary for AIs to always find those answers, as long as they are able to recognise cases in which they’re uncertain and do nothing (while there are some cases in which inaction can cause harm, such as a self-driving car ceasing to steer mid-journey, it seems that the most worrying long-term catastrophes can be avoided by inaction). Another reason for optimism is that even incomplete or negative results from social science experiments may be useful in informing technical safety research going forward. However, in some cases the systems we&#x27;re trying to reason about are very different from anything we can test now - for example, AI debaters that are much stronger than humans.</p><p><strong>Richard&#x27;s opinion:</strong> This post, and its accompanying paper, seems very sensible to me. While I have some doubts about how informative human debate data will be about superhuman debaters, it certainly seems worth trying to gain more empirical information. Note that while the paper primarily discusses Debate, I think that many of its arguments are applicable to any human-in-the-loop safety methods (and probably others too). Currently I think Ought is the safety group focusing most on collecting human data, but I look forward to seeing other researchers doing so.</p><h1><strong>Technical AI alignment</strong></h1><h3><strong>Technical agendas and prioritization</strong></h3><p><u><a href=""https://futureoflife.org/2019/01/31/fli-podcast-ai-breakthroughs-and-challenges-in-2018-with-david-krueger-and-roman-yampolskiy/"">FLI Podcast: AI Breakthroughs and Challenges in 2018 with David Krueger and Roman Yampolskiy</a></u> <em>(Ariel Conn, David Krueger and Roman Yampolskiy)</em>: David and Roman review AI progress in 2018 and speculate about its implications. Roman identified a pattern where we see breakthroughs like <u><a href=""https://deepmind.com/blog/alphazero-shedding-new-light-grand-games-chess-shogi-and-go/"">AlphaZero</a></u> (<u><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/6751e45fbb48/alignment-newsletter-36"">AN #36</a></u>), <u><a href=""https://deepmind.com/blog/alphastar-mastering-real-time-strategy-game-starcraft-ii/"">AlphaStar</a></u> (<u><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/768a8130013f/alignment-newsletter-43"">AN #43</a></u>) and <u><a href=""https://deepmind.com/blog/alphafold/"">AlphaFold</a></u> (<u><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/6751e45fbb48/alignment-newsletter-36"">AN #36</a></u>) so frequently now that it no longer seems as impressive when a new one comes out. David on the other hand sounded less impressed by progress on Dota and StarCraft, since both AI systems were capable of executing actions that humans could never do (fast reaction times for Dota and high actions-per-minute for StarCraft). He also thought that these projects didn&#x27;t result in any clear general algorithmic insights the way AlphaZero did.</p><p>On the deep RL + robotics side, David identified major progress in <u><a href=""https://blog.openai.com/learning-dexterity/"">Dactyl</a></u> (<u><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/51717855ea27/alignment-newsletter-18"">AN #18</a></u>) and <u><a href=""https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/06/scalable-deep-reinforcement-learning.html"">QT-Opt</a></u> (which I remember reading and liking but apparently I failed to put in the newsletter). He also cited GANs as having improved significantly, and talked about feature-wise transformations in particular.

He discusses his recent work in which participants are prompted to consider Rawls&#x27; Veil of Ignorance argument (that when making decisions affecting many people, we should do so as if we don&#x27;t know which one we are) and then asked to evaluate moral dilemmas such as trolley problems.

Key quote: &quot;OpenAI HAS achieved the ability to pass the Turing test against humans on autopilot&quot;. This suggests that fake news, social manipulation, etc. will become much easier.

I&#x27;m focusing on the second one, which talks about AlphaStar&#x27;s technical details and implications. Some of this post overlaps with my summary of AlphaStar, but those parts are better fleshed out and have more details.</p><p>First, imitation learning is a surprisingly good base policy, getting to the level of a Gold player. It&#x27;s surprising because you might expect the <u><a href=""https://www.ri.cmu.edu/pub_files/2011/4/Ross-AISTATS11-NoRegret.pdf"">DAgger</a></u> problem to be extreme: since there are so many actions in a StarCraft game, your imitation learning policy will make some errors, and those errors will then compound over the very long remainder of the episode as they take the policy further away from normal human play into states that the policy wasn&#x27;t trained on.</p><p>Second, population-based training is probably crucial and will be important in the future, because it allows for exploring the full strategy space.</p><p>Third, the major challenge is making RL achieve okay performance, and after that they very quickly become great. It took years of research to get Dota and StarCraft bots reach decent play, and then a few days of more training got them to be world class. Fun quote: &quot;although OpenAI’s DotA 2 agent lost against a pro team, <u><a href=""https://twitter.com/openai/status/1037765547427954688"">they were able to beat their old agent 80% of the time with 10 days of training</a></u>&quot;.</p><p>Fourth, there were a lot of research results that went into AlphaStar. This suggests that there are large gains to be had by throwing a lot of techniques together and seeing how well they work, which doesn&#x27;t happen very much currently. There are good reasons for this: it&#x27;s much easier to evaluate a technique if its built upon a simple, standard algorithm rather than having to consider all of its interactions with other techniques which you may or may not be able to properly compare against. Still, there are going to be some cool results that we could do now if we just threw the right things together, and this sort of work also lets us test techniques in new settings to see which ones actually work in general, as opposed to only in the original evaluation.</p><p><strong>Rohin&#x27;s opinion:</strong> I really like this post, and agree with almost everything in it. On the imitation learning point, I also found it surprising how well imitation learning worked. Alex suggests that it could be that human data has enough variation that the agent can learn how to recover from incorrect decisions it could make. I think this is a partial explanation at best -- there is a huge combinatorial explosion, it&#x27;s not clear why you don&#x27;t need a much larger dataset to cover the entire space. Maybe there are &quot;natural&quot; representations in any realistic complex environment that you start to accurately learn at the level of compute that they&#x27;re using, and once you have those then imitation learning with sufficient variation can work well.</p><p>On the last point about tossing techniques together, I think this might sometimes be worth doing but often may not be. It makes sense to do this with any real task, since that&#x27;s a test of the technique against reality. (Here StarCraft counts as a &quot;real&quot; task while Atari does not; the criterion is something like &quot;if the task is successfully automated we are impressed regardless of how it is solved&quot;.) I&#x27;m less keen on tossing techniques together for artificial benchmarks. I think typically these techniques improve the sample efficiency by a constant multiplicative factor by adding something akin to a good inductive bias; in that case throwing them together may let us solve the artificial benchmark sooner but it doesn&#x27;t give us great evidence that the &quot;inductive bias&quot; will be good for realistic tasks. I think I don&#x27;t actually disagree with Alex very much on the object-level recommendations, I would just frame them differently.</p><p><u><a href=""http://ai.googleblog.com/2019/02/learning-to-generalize-from-sparse-and.html"">Learning to Generalize from Sparse and Underspecified Rewards</a></u> <em>(Rishabh Agarwal et al)</em></p><p><u><a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.09330"">Reward Shaping via Meta-Learning</a></u> <em>(Haosheng Zou, Tongzheng Ren et al)</em></p><p><u><a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.07015"">Investigating Generalisation in Continuous Deep Reinforcement Learning</a></u> <em>(Chenyang Zhao et al)</em></p><h3><strong>Deep learning</strong></h3><p><u><a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.07638"">Random Search and Reproducibility for Neural Architecture Search</a></u> <em>(Liam Li et al)</em></p><h1><strong>News</strong></h1><p><u><a href=""http://rationality.org/workshops/apply-msfp"">MIRI Summer Fellows Program</a></u> <em>(Colm Ó Riain)</em>: CFAR and MIRI are running the MIRI Summer Fellows Program from August 9-24.

Namely, the code you write is composable.</p> <p>Here's what I mean: If you want to generate a C function that prints out names of countries' capitals then you can generate the code that does the actual printing first:</p> <div> <pre> <code>data = { &quot;Afghanistan&quot;: &quot;Kabul&quot;, &quot;Brazil&quot;: &quot;Brasilia&quot;, &quot;Canada&quot;: &quot;Ottawa&quot;, } body = t/'' for country, capital in data.items(): body |= t/&quot;&quot;&quot; printf(&quot;@{capital} is the capital of @{country}&quot;); &quot;&quot;&quot;</code> </pre></div> <p>Once done, you cen generate the scaffolding:</p> <div> <pre> <code>program = t/&quot;&quot;&quot; #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; int main(void) { @{body} return 0; } &quot;&quot;&quot;</code> </pre></div> <p>The example, of course, shows just two levels of nesting. In practice, however, you'd have many levels of nesting.</p> <p>But whatever the nesting level, you, as a programmer, can focus on a single task at a time. First, you think about how to print the capitals. Then you think about the scaffolding. There's no overlap.</p> <p>Compare that to your typical templating solution:</p> <div> <pre> <code>template = Template(&quot;&quot;&quot; #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; int main(void) { {% for country, capital in data.items() %} printf(&quot;{{ capital }} is the capital of {{ country }}&quot;); {% endfor %} return 0; } &quot;&quot;&quot;) template.render(data=data)</code> </pre></div> <p>Note how you start with writing scaffolding (include, main) then you switch to the business logic (printf), then you get back to scaffolding (return).</p> <p>The example is trivial and as such, the both solutions are kind of comparable.</p> <p>However, imagine there are five levels of nesting.</p> <p>The code written using Tiles would, logically, look like this:</p> <div> <pre> <code>level1 level2 level3 level4 level5</code> </pre></div> <p>The code written using one the classic templating tools, on the other hand, would look like this:</p> <div> <pre> <code>level1 level2 level3 level4 level5 level4 level3 level2 level1</code> </pre></div> <p><strong>March 2nd, 2019</strong></p> </div> <p>by <a href=""http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/martin-sustrik""><img src=""http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=939&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1551566742"" /></a><a href=""http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/martin-sustrik"">martin_sustrik</a></p>",,sustrik,sustrik,Martin Sustrik

According to this model, our stream of consciousness consists of a series of discrete moments, each a mental object. Under this model, there are always different &#x201C;subminds&#x201D; which are projecting mental objects into consciousness. At different moments, different mental objects get selected as the content of consciousness.</p><span><figure><img src=""https://stuff.kajsotala.fi/LW/Brain/TMI_1.png"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:40%""></figure></span><p>If you&#x2019;ve read some of the previous posts in this sequence, you may recognize this as sounding familiar. We started by discussing some of the <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/x4n4jcoDP7xh5LWLq/book-summary-consciousness-and-the-brain"">neuroscience research on consciousness</a></u>. There we covered the GWT/GNW theory of consciousness being a &#x201C;workspace&#x201D; in the brain that different brain systems project information into, and which allows them to synchronize their processing around a single piece of information. In the next post, we discussed the <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5gfqG3Xcopscta3st/building-up-to-an-internal-family-systems-model"">psychotherapy model of Internal Family Systems</a></u>, which also conceives the mind of being composed of different parts, many of which are trying to accomplish various aims by competing to project various mental objects into consciousness. (TMI talks about subminds, IFS talks about parts, GWT/GNW just talks about different parts of the brain; for consistency&#x2019;s sake, I will just use &#x201C;subagent&#x201D; in the rest of this post.)</p><span><figure><img src=""https://stuff.kajsotala.fi/LW/Brain/TMI_2.png"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:40%""></figure></span><p>At this point, we might want to look at some criticisms of this kind of a framework. Susan Blackmore has written an interesting paper called &#x201C;<u><a href=""https://www.susanblackmore.uk/articles/there-is-no-stream-of-consciousness/"">There is no stream of consciousness</a></u>&#x201D;. She has several examples for why we should reject the notion of any stream of consciousness. For instance, this one:</p><blockquote>For many years now I have been getting my students to ask themselves, as many times as possible every day &#x201C;Am I conscious now?&#x201D;. Typically they find the task unexpectedly hard to do; and hard to remember to do. But when they do it, it has some very odd effects. First they often report that they always seem to be conscious when they ask the question but become less and less sure about whether they were conscious a moment before. With more practice they say that asking the question itself makes them more conscious, and that they can extend this consciousness from a few seconds to perhaps a minute or two. What does this say about consciousness the rest of the time?</blockquote><blockquote>Just this starting exercise (we go on to various elaborations of it as the course progresses) begins to change many students&#x2019; assumptions about their own experience. In particular they become less sure that there are always contents in their stream of consciousness. How does it seem to you? It is worth deciding at the outset because this is what I am going to deny. I suggest that there is no stream of consciousness. [...]</blockquote><blockquote>I want to replace our familiar idea of a stream of consciousness with that of illusory backwards streams. At any time in the brain a whole lot of different things are going on. None of these is either &#x2018;in&#x2019; or &#x2018;out&#x2019; of consciousness, so we don&#x2019;t need to explain the &#x2018;difference&#x2019; between conscious and unconscious processing. Every so often something happens to create what seems to have been a stream. For example, we ask &#x201C;Am I conscious now?&#x201D;. At this point a retrospective story is concocted about what was in the stream of consciousness a moment before, together with a self who was apparently experiencing it. Of course there was neither a conscious self nor a stream, but it now seems as though there was. This process goes on all the time with new stories being concocted whenever required. At any time that we bother to look, or ask ourselves about it, it seems as though there is a stream of consciousness going on. When we don&#x2019;t bother to ask, or to look, it doesn&#x2019;t, but then we don&#x2019;t notice so it doesn&#x2019;t matter. This way the grand illusion is concocted.</blockquote><p>This is an interesting argument. A similar example might be that when I first started doing something like <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/riyvpus8x9sXa3W57/track-back-meditation"">track-back meditation</a></u> when on walks, checking what was in my mind just a second ago. I was surprised at just how many thoughts I would have while on a walk, that I would usually just totally forget about afterwards, and come back home having no recollection of 95% of them. This seems similar to Blackmore&#x2019;s &#x201C;was I conscious just now&#x201D; question, in that when I started to check back the contents of my mind just a few seconds ago, I was frequently surprised by what I found out. (And yes, I&#x2019;ve tried the &#x201C;was I conscious just now&#x201D; question as well, with similar results as Blackmore&#x2019;s students.)</p><p>Another example that Blackmore cites is <u><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_blindness"">change blindness</a></u>. When people are shown an image, it&#x2019;s often possible to introduce unnoticed major changes into the image, as long as people are not looking at the very location of the change when it&#x2019;s made. Blackmore also interprets this as well to mean that there is no stream of consciousness - we aren&#x2019;t actually building up a detailed visual model of our environment, which we would then experience in our consciousness. </p><p>One might summarize this class of objections as something like, &#x201C;stream-of-consciousness theories assume that there is a conscious stream of mental objects in our minds that we are aware of. However, upon investigation it often becomes apparent that we <em>haven&#x2019;t</em> been aware of something that was supposedly in our stream of consciousness. In change blindness experiments we weren&#x2019;t aware of what the changed detail actually was pre-change, and more generally we don&#x2019;t even have clear awareness of <em>whether we were conscious a moment ago</em>.&#x201D;</p><p>But on the other hand, as we reviewed earlier, there still seem to be <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/x4n4jcoDP7xh5LWLq/book-summary-consciousness-and-the-brain"">objective experiments</a></u> which establish the existence of something like a &#x201C;consciousness&#x201D;, which holds approximately one mental object at a time.</p><p>So I would interpret Blackmore&#x2019;s findings differently. I agree that answers to questions like &#x201C;am I conscious right now&#x201D; are constructed somewhat on the spot, in response to the question. But I don&#x2019;t think that we need to reject having a stream of consciousness because of that. I think that <em>you can be aware of something, without being aware of the fact that you were aware of it</em>.</p><h1>Robots again</h1><p>For example, let&#x2019;s look at a robot that has something like a global consciousness workspace. Here are the contents of its consciousness on five successive timesteps:</p><ol><li>It&#x2019;s raining outside</li><li>Battery low</li><li>Technological unemployment protestors are outside</li><li>Battery low</li><li>I&#x2019;m now recharging my battery</li></ol><p>Notice that at the first timestep, the robot was aware of the fact that it was raining outside; this was the fact being broadcast from consciousness to all subsystems. But at no later timestep was it conscious of the fact that at the first timestep, it had been aware of it raining outside. Assuming that no subagent happened to save this specific piece of information, then all knowledge of it was lost as soon as the content of the consciousness workspace changed.</p><p>But suppose that there is some subagent which happens to keep track of what has been happening in consciousness. In that case it may choose to make its memory of previous mind-states consciously available:</p><p>6. At time 1, there was the thought that [It&#x2019;s raining outside]</p><p>Now there is a mental object in the robot&#x2019;s consciousness, which encodes not only the observation of it raining outside before, <em>but also </em>the fact that the system was thinking of this before. That knowledge may then have further effects on the system - for example, when I became aware of how much time I spent on useless rumination while on walks, I got frustrated. And this seems to have contributed to making me ruminate less: as the system&#x2019;s actions and their overall effect were metacognitively represented and made available for the system&#x2019;s decision-making, this had the effect of the system adjusting its behavior to tune down activity that was deemed useless.</p><p><em>The Mind Illuminated</em> calls this <em>introspective awareness. </em>Moments of introspective awareness are summaries of the system&#x2019;s previous mental activity, with there being a dedicated subagent with the task of preparing and outputting such summaries. Usually it will only focus on tracking the specific kinds of mental states which seem important to track. </p><p>So if we ask ourselves &#x201C;was I conscious just now&#x201D; for the first time, that might cause the agent to output <em>some</em> representation of the previous state we were in. But it doesn&#x2019;t have experience in answering this question, and if it&#x2019;s anything like most human memory systems, it needs to have some kind of a concrete example of what exactly it is looking for. The first time we ask it, the subagent&#x2019;s pattern-matcher knows that the system is presumably conscious at <em>this</em> instant, so it should be looking for some feature in our previous experiences which somehow resembles this moment, but it&#x2019;s not quite sure of which one. And an introspective mind state, is likely to be different from the less introspective mind state that we were in a moment ago. </p><p>This has the result that on the first few times when it&#x2019;s asked, the subagent may produce an uncertain answer: it&#x2019;s basically asking its memory store &#x201C;do my previous mind states resemble this one as judged by some unclear criteria&#x201D;, which is obviously hard to answer.</p><p>With time, operating from the assumption that the system is currently conscious, the subagent may learn to find more connections between the current moment and past ones that it still happens to have in memory. Then it will report those as consciousness, and likely also focus more attention on aspects of the current experience which it has learned to consider &#x201C;conscious&#x201D;. This would match Blackmore&#x2019;s report of &#x201C;with more practice [the students] say that asking the question itself makes them more conscious, and that they can extend this consciousness from a few seconds to perhaps a minute or two&#x201D;. </p><p>Similarly, this explains me not being aware of most of my thoughts, as well as change blindness. I had a stream of thoughts, but because I had not been practicing introspective awareness, there were no moments of introspective awareness making me aware of having had these thoughts. Though I was aware of the thoughts at the time, this was never re-presented in a way that would have left a memory trace. </p><p>In change blindness experiments, people might look at the same spot in a picture twice. Although they <em>did</em> see the contents of that spot at time 1 and were aware of them, that memory was never stored anywhere. When at time 2 they looked at the same spot and it was different, the lack of an awareness of what they saw previously means that they don&#x2019;t notice the change.</p><p>Introspective awareness will be an important concept in my future posts. (Abram Demski also wrote a previous post on <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/riyvpus8x9sXa3W57/track-back-meditation"">Track-Back Meditation</a></u>, which is basically an exercise for introspective awareness.) Today, I&#x2019;m going to talk about its relation to a concept I&#x2019;ve talked about before: blending / cognitive fusion.</p><h1>Blending</h1><p>I&#x2019;ve <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/mELQFMi9egPn5EAjK/my-attempt-to-explain-looking-insight-meditation-and"">previously discussed &#x201C;cognitive fusion&#x201D;</a></u>, as what happens when the content of a thought or emotion is experienced as an objective truth rather than a mental construct. For instance, you get angry at someone, and the emotion makes you experience them as a horrible person - and in the moment this seems just true to you, rather than being an interpretation created by your emotional reaction. </p><p>You can also fuse with more logical-type beliefs - or for that matter any beliefs - when you just treat them as unquestioned truths, without remembering the possibility that they might be wrong. In my previous post, I suggested that many forms of meditation were training the skill of intentional cognitive defusion, but I didn&#x2019;t explain <em>how </em>exactly meditation lets you get better at defusion. </p><p>In my <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5gfqG3Xcopscta3st/building-up-to-an-internal-family-systems-model"">post about Internal Family Systems</a></u>, I mentioned that IFS uses the term &#x201C;blending&#x201D; for when a subagent is sending emotional content to your consciousness, and suggested that IFS&#x2019;s unblending techniques worked by associating extra content around those thoughts and emotions, allowing you to recognize them as mental objects. For instance, you might notice sensations in your body that were associated with the emotion, and let your mind generate a mental image of what the physical form of those sensations might look like. Then this set of emotions, thoughts, sensations, and visual images becomes &#x201C;packaged together&#x201D; in your mind, unambiguously designating it as a mental object.</p><p>My current model is that meditation works similarly, only using moments of introspective awareness as the &#x201C;extra wrapper&#x201D;. Suppose again that you are a robot, and the contents of your consciousness is:</p><ol><li>It&#x2019;s raining outside.</li></ol><p>Note that this mental object is basically being taken as an axiomatic truth: what is in your consciousness, is that it is raining outside.</p><p>On the other hand, suppose that your consciousness contains this:</p><ol><li>Sensor 62 is reporting that [it&#x2019;s raining outside].</li></ol><p>Now the mental object in your consciousness contains the origin of the belief that it&#x2019;s raining. The information is made available to various subagents which have other beliefs. E.g. a subagent holding knowledge about sensors, might upon seeing this mental object, recognize the reference to &#x201C;sensor 62&#x201D; and output its estimate of that sensor&#x2019;s reliability. The previous two mental objects could then be combined by a third subagent:</p><ol><li>(Subagent A:) Sensor 62 is reporting that [it is raining outside]</li><li>(Subagent B:) Readings from sensor 62 are reliable 38% of the time.</li><li>(Subagent C:) It is raining outside with a 38% probability.</li></ol><p>In my discussion of <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/x4n4jcoDP7xh5LWLq/book-summary-consciousness-and-the-brain"">Consciousness and the Brain</a></u>, I noted that one of the proposed functions of consciousness is to act as a <u><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Production_system_(computer_science)"">production system</a></u>, where many different subagents may identify particular mental objects and then apply various rules to transform the contents of consciousness as a result. What I&#x2019;ve sketched above is exactly a sequence of production rules: at e.g. step 2, something like the rule &#x201C;if sensor 62 is mentioned as an information source, output the current best estimate of sensor 62&#x2019;s reliability&#x201D; is applied by subagent B. Then at the third timestep, another subagent combines the observations from the previous two timesteps, and sends <em>that</em> into consciousness.</p><p>What was important was that the system was not representing the outside weather just as an axiomatic statement, but rather it was explicitly representing it as a fallible piece of information with a particular source. </p><p>Here&#x2019;s something similar:</p><ol><li>I am a bad person.</li><li>At t1, there was the thought that [I am a bad person].</li></ol><p>Here, the moment of awareness is highlighting the nature of the previous thought as a thought, thus causing the system to treat it as such. If you used introspective awareness for unblending, it might go something like this:</p><ol><li><em>Blending:</em> you are experiencing everything that a subagent outputs as true. In this situation, there&#x2019;s no introspective awareness that would highlight those outputs as being just thoughts. &#x201C;My friend is a horrible person&#x201D;, feels like a fact about the world.</li><li><em>Partial blending:</em> you realize that the thoughts which you have might not be entirely true, but you still feel them emotionally and might end up acting accordingly. In this situation, there are moments of introspective awareness, but there are also enough of the original &#x201C;unmarked&#x201D; thoughts to also be affecting your other subagents. You feel hostile towards your friend, and realize that this may not be rationally warranted, but still end up talking in an angry tone and maybe saying things you shouldn&#x2019;t.</li><li><em>Unblending:</em> all or nearly all of the thoughts coming from a subagent are being filtered through a mechanism that wraps them inside moments of introspective awareness, such as &#x201C;this subagent is thinking that X&#x201D;. You know that you have a subagent which has this opinion, but none of the other subagents are treating it as a proven fact.</li></ol><p>By training your mind to have more introspective moments of awareness, you will become capable of perceiving more and more mental objects as just that. A classic example would be all those mindfulness exercises where you stop identifying with the content of a thought, and see it as something separate from yourself. At more advanced levels, even mental objects which build up sensations such as those which make up the experience of a self may be seen as just constructed mental objects.</p>",,Kaj_Sotala,kaj_sotala,Kaj_Sotala

Instead, it’s an <strong>optimization strategy for reducing uncertainty about decisions we need to make</strong>. That’s the central argument of Douglas Hubbard’s <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/How-Measure-Anything-Intangibles-Business-dp-0470539399/dp/0470539399/ref=mt_hardcover?_encoding=UTF8&amp;me=&amp;qid=""><em>How to Measure Anything: Finding the Value of “Intangibles” in Business</em></a>, which remains one of the most important books on decision-making I’ve read since first encountering it more than seven years ago.</p><p><em>How to Measure Anything</em>’s reframing of measurement’s purpose is nothing short of revolutionary, none more so than for workers in what I call the “knowledge industries” — evaluation, research, data science, policy analysis, forecasting, etc. Among other ramifications, it establishes that measurement has value <em>only insofar as it can reduce uncertainty in the context of a decision that matters. </em>This emphasis on specific decisions — in other words, starting with the decision and seeking out additional information only as needed to gain confidence in making it — suggests a hyper-applied approach to evaluation and research that would represent a radical departure from the way these functions operate at most organizations.</p><p>Hubbard also argues that if something matters, <a href=""https://twitter.com/iandavidmoss/status/1092523414143803393"">it must have observable consequences or leave some kind of observable trace</a>. Therefore, <em>everything that matters is measurable</em>, even seemingly “intangible” phenomena that most would consider to be beyond the realm of quantification. If something does not seem amenable to measurement, it’s a sign that either it doesn’t actually matter or it’s not sufficiently well defined.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href=""https://twitter.com/iandavidmoss/status/1092523414143803393"">@iandavidmoss</a></p></blockquote><p><em>How to Measure Anything</em> presents a panoply of methods for defining measurement problems more clearly and training stakeholders in solving them, including <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_problem"">Fermi estimation</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calibrated_probability_assessment"">calibrated probability assessment</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method"">Monte Carlo simulation</a>, various <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"">sampling</a> techniques, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_probability"">Bayesian statistics</a>, and methods to <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3877076/"">aggregate expert judgments</a>. Many of these fit like jigsaw puzzle pieces into an overarching methodology Hubbard has developed for analyzing and making any decision, which he calls <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_information_economics"">Applied Information Economics</a>. The basic steps of AIE are as follows:</p><ol><li>Define a decision problem and relevant uncertainties</li><li>Determine what you know now</li><li>Compute the value of additional information</li><li>Apply measurement instruments to high-value measurements</li><li>Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the value of additional information drops to zero</li><li>Make decision and act on it.</li></ol><h3>A Book Full of Math for People Who Hate Numbers</h3><p>Throughout the book, Hubbard relentlessly seeks to persuade readers that measurement is easier than they think. He points out that our intuition naturally models decisions all the time — as long as we can understand a situation, we are already modeling it in our heads. He demonstrates a so-called “mathless” method he invented for reliably estimating the median of any group of values with as few as five random samples. He deduces that most of the value in measurement typically comes from the initial investment of resources; contrary to conventional wisdom, the more data you have, the <em>less</em> useful additional data will typically be. This means Hubbard’s method can be used even in extremely information-poor environments, and in fact thrives in those contexts.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href=""https://twitter.com/iandavidmoss/status/1092523431520813058"">@iandavidmoss</a></p></blockquote><p><em>How to Measure Anything</em> is packed to the gills with practical tools designed to help readers realize the potential of these insights, and the tables, examples, and templates provided throughout ensure that readers can get started building their own decision models right away. In addition, the book’s accompanying <a href=""http://howtomeasureanything.com"">website</a> offers a set of reusable Excel spreadsheets demonstrating techniques discussed in the text. At the same time, Hubbard’s constant encouragement for mathphobic readers lends the material a level of accessibility that most texts on the topic never approach.</p><p><em>How to Measure Anything</em> is not without flaws. Its insistence that literally anything can be measured can become dogmatic at times, and glosses over some very real challenges germane to modeling complex systems and extremely rare events in particular. It also fails to consider the process for deciding when an explicit decision modeling approach is needed at all, which is important given that we make the vast majority of our decisions intuitively. In my own practice, I have found that the AIE technique, while fundamentally sound, usually requires substantial adaptations and simplification to gain buy-in from stakeholders, even after they have had the opportunity to read the book themselves. And while Hubbard has a gift for explaining complex ideas in simple terminology, many of the chapters in the most recent edition of the book include digressions that distract from the core points of the book and become repetitive after a while.</p><p>Even so, it’s amazing to me that <em>How to Measure Anything</em> isn’t more widely recognized or highly revered in the social sector. Chapter 3 alone should be required reading for any graduate professional aimed at training future nonprofit and public service leaders. In one sense it’s not surprising, as the framing and marketing suggest an emphasis on business applications. But if anything, its lessons and philosophy are even more relevant to realms where stakeholders must balance disparate and hard-to-quantify goals without the benefit of advanced training in mathematics. That’s most of philanthropy right there!</p><h3>Not Knowing Everything Is Still Good for Something</h3><p><em>How to Measure Anything</em>’s emphasis on uncertainty, and thinking of that uncertainty as a continuum, opens the door to a probabilistic way of thinking about the world that makes perfect sense as soon as you stop to think about it, yet is completely foreign to most organizational cultures.</p><p>Learning to approach management and life challenges with a probabilistic mindset is incredibly empowering. It makes measurement challenges feel far less intimidating and much more tractable, while reducing the social stress and embarrassment that comes from having one’s predictions revealed to be wrong (because we’re all wrong sometimes). It is also a recipe for far more cost-effective and impactful use of resources whenever any analytical process, including research and evaluation, is called for.</p><p><em>How to Measure Anything </em>may not be a perfect book, but the contributions it makes to the discourse are enormous. If foundations, donors, government agencies, and major nonprofits applied its principles on a more routine basis, even if they didn’t use the full AIE method or go to the effort of explicitly modeling their decisions all that often, I’m convinced the world would be a radically different — and hopefully better — place.</p><img src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=e3b51c46a792"" />",,Ian David Moss,ian-david-moss,Ian David Moss

You forgot to say <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/wCqfCLs8z5Qw4GbKS/the-importance-of-saying-oops"">zoopsie</a>. Before this gets philosophical on this essay with the main problem behind nihilism and subsequent thought on it. You will see everywhere the sunk fallacy of people dealing with emptiness through entertainment, food addiction, Netflix and porn. If it's fun it is not a bad investment.</p>

Even Scott Alexander from SSC indulges in stress free <a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/11/28/book-review-the-mind-illuminated/"">Buddhism</a>. Basically a way to purify ones mind into better understanding the true teaching of the Buddha. But who would you rather trust? Ancient “religion” who survived 2500 years and the communities still live. Or just a pragmatic guy who you need to pay 10$ a month for his meditation app. Spirituality is it thought in here, the commercial term. Sam harris’ no self ideas are core teaching of the Theravada along with monastic life and rigidness.
But Theravada doesn't deserve its bad reputation, many countries that are Theravada monk at age 20 and they then quit are better off that self delusional “spiritual enlightenment” obsession that people have.</p>
<p>Cambodia and Sri Lanka are interesting countries because the core of their faith is Theravada but their politics is down right laughable. Cambodia there is no law FWIW. The only thing missing in countries eastern of us are Judeo-Christian values (Western society is build)
Christianity should be more thought about how to treat other externally better. And Buddhism how to make sure your inner harmony can do that.</p>
<p>So from a rational point of view, what is reincarnation? There was a study about reincarnation <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Stevenson"">Dr. Ian Stevenson</a> but it has nothing to do with reincarnation proof but rather with scientific process problems. (He failed under confirmation bias, but this man has lived amazing experience, side note: he met with Huxley the author of brave new world). This can be like a reminder that reincarnation is just not possible (beyond cryonics and mind uploading) and telling that it can not be disproven is just missing the point.</p>
<p>Problems like this arise from <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/hwi8JQjspnMWyWs4g/resist-the-happy-death-spiral"">happy death spiral</a> of Buddhism. Zizek the philosopher criticised us for adapting such philosophies, calling them late stage <a href=""http://www.thinkbuddha.org/article/113/western-buddhism-and-other-capitalist-avatars"">capitalism of sorts</a>.</p>
<p>A rational prediction would be: just like communism gradually disappeared in the 20th centuries. And capitalist thrived. Like that the Chinese civilization would become a better economical and superpower along with the philosophies of its origin (Western countries would indeed advance with this stress free commercialised buzzword). You just can not compete.</p>

I'd bet I'm still missing an important piece or two from the picture.</em></p><hr class=""dividerBlock""><p>If often seems that if only we could get our motivation in order, we could work wonders. Wouldn’t it be good if we always had the motivation to do what we really wanted or ought to do? Our homework, our taxes, our jobs, our diets and exercise, our artistic and creative hobbies, our study plans, on and on. There are so many things we feel like we theoretically could do and yet we don’t. There are so many things we do, but only by fighting ourselves each step of the way [1].</p><p>Wrestling with a few novel motivational challenges of my own, I’ve been revisiting my models and skills. It feels like a number of pieces have clicked into place recently and I have some insights worth sharing. Hopefully, you will benefit from this post and/or tell me how it is wrong or incomplete.</p><br><h2>Your Motivation System</h2><p>We can reasonably believe that your brain has a motivation system (or an overall motivation system comprised of a great many motivation subsystems). One reason to believe this is the <u><a href=""https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C5&amp;q=behavioral+neuroscience+motivation&amp;btnG=&amp;oq=behavioral+neuroscience+mot"">extensive scientific literature</a></u> captured in tens of thousands of papers and built from probably at least as many researcher-years. Compared to that, the models described in this post are the crudest simplification. However, the models in this post have the advantage that they’re much quicker to read and much easier to apply to your life. </p><p>The second reason to believe that your brain has a motivation system is a mix of your first-person experience and first-principles reasoning. Consider that you have only one body and that in any given moment you can execute approximately only a single activity. You are eating or you are sleeping, but not both. Something in you must make a decision at every given moment about which activity you will execute. </p><p>Now, you might think that is <em>you</em> who makes the decision about what to do. “It is me, <em>I</em> think with my free will and weigh my options and then decide what to do!” Ignoring for the moment that we so often struggle to do what we “decide” to do, I will assert that there far, far too many considerations when deciding what to do for your conscience explicit mind to handle it all on its own. You’d need to be tracking all your biological needs (hunger, thirst, sleep, temperature), all your opportunity costs, all possibly relevant pieces of experience and heuristic that feed into decisions, the costs, benefits, risks, and on and on. Maybe you could build a conscious mind to handle all that, but I don’t think we humans are built that way.</p><p>Instead, we have these handy, dandy subconscious mental systems which aggregate all the relevant info and ultimately produce experienced felt <em>urges </em>or <em>drives </em>to do particular things. Some scientists might like to define motivation as <em>the energizing of behavior in pursuit of a goal </em>[2], but I think for our practical purposes it’s better to define the fundamental definition motivation as follows: </p><p><strong>Motivation towards a behavior X is the experience of an urge to do X.</strong></p><p>Via urges (which sometimes promise reward if acted upon, but not necessarily), our mind tells us what to do. If I am thirsty, I experience an urge to go find a drink. If I am tired, I experience an urge to sleep. If I see a tasty donut, I experience an urge to eat it. If I am anxious about failing my calculus class, I experience an urge to go study.</p><p>Note that although they are not the same thing as urges, emotions are deeply connected to them. Major theories of emotion acknowledge five components of emotion, one of which is <em>action tendency </em>[3]. This is close to saying that emotions usually come with urges. Anger with the urge to lash out, shame with the urge to hide, love with the urge to express caring or affection.</p><br><h2>Motivation is a Competition</h2><p>In any moment, there are a great many appealing actions we might take. Taking a nap might be pretty good, or listening to music, or having a snack, or going on FB, or finishing off that report for work. We can’t experience compelling urges to do all of them, and definitely not equally strong urges. That would defeat the point. The point of motivation, given the rivalrous nature of actions, is that we experience an urge to do the one thing we most want/ought to do. </p><p>Admittedly, we do often experience multiple competing urges in the moment. You might be very hungry but also really want to finish the level of the video game you’re playing - you’re experiencing an urge for both. This isn’t uncommon, but I think it is uncommon to have ten strong urges towards ten different things at once. It might be reasonable to have a couple of competing urges at once: the conscious mind experiencing those urges can then arbitrate, perhaps using some abstract S2 knowledge not available to the mostly S1 motivation system.</p><p>The overall point here is that for you to have motivation towards doing X (an urge/drive towards doing it), <strong>X can’t be outcompeted by Y within your motivation system</strong>. If X is outcompeted by Y, you are very likely to find yourself doing Y instead.</p><br><h2>You Have to Win in the Moment</h2><p>Not only is motivation a competition, but that competition is real-time. In each moment, you must choose your actions from amongst many possibilities and, in each moment, your mind generates guiding urges towards some options but not others. </p><p>You might suppose that you can make a decision at 11:00am about you will do three hours later at. 2:00pm -- this doesn’t free you from making a decision later on nor abrogate the need for motivation later on. When 2:00pm comes round, you will either feel motivation to execute your 11:00am plan or you won’t (as is so common), and you will have to decide whether to stick to your plan or not. You can make plans in advance, you can form intentions in advance, you attempt to set up commitment mechanisms in advance -- <strong>yet what you ultimately do in the moment will be decided in the moment by the conditions that obtain the moment</strong>.</p><p>The consequence of this is that any successful plan of action requires that you have sufficient motivation/urges (or willpower, see Appendix) to overcome all other competing motivation/urges throughout all the moments you need to be executing that plan.</p><p>It is not enough that you feel really, really motivated towards your plan when you are making it if that motivation will later be outcompeted by other things once it’s execution-time. Alternatively stated, people make bad plans because they fail to account for the competing urges which will predictably arise when they’re trying to actually execute. People further fail to correct their plans because even when they’re not succeeding at executing them, they’re not noticing that the reason they’re not executing them is because they’re losing the motivation competition continually at the moment-to-moment scale. It’s easy to focus on your motivation to do X while forgetting about your competing motivations to do Y and Z.</p><p>Consider different meanings we might assign to “<em>I am motivated to do X.”</em> This might mean that:</p><p>A. I have a preference to be in a world where I have done X. Perhaps then I will experience more pleasure or less pain.</p><p>B. I believe X will instrumentally result in a desired outcome A such that X is an action I would benefit from taking.</p><p>C. Sometimes I experience an urge to do X.</p><p>D. I experience sufficient urge to do X that it outcompetes urges for other things I might do enough of the time that I actually make meaningful progress towards X.</p><p>I contend that for any action X, you have are only truly motivated to do X if you have achieved state D. Anything else amounts to “I am motivated to do X, but not, like, actually motivated enough to do it instead of other things.”</p><br><h2>How to Win</h2><p>Saying that motivation is a matter of winning in the moment is all very good, but how does one actually do that? </p><p>Unfortunately, a proper treatment of this not-so-small topic will make this past far too long and instead requires its own post (<em>Motivation Part 2: How to Win, coming soon to a screen near you!</em>).  Nonetheless, I can offer a high-level summary here:</p><ol type=""1""><li><strong>Understand how your motivation system performs its moment-to-moment prioritization and design around that.</strong> This will lead you to things like <u><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospect_theory"">prospect theory</a></u>, <u><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_discounting"">hyperbolic discounting</a></u>, and <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/reitXJgJXFzKpdKyd/beware-trivial-inconveniences"">trivial inconveniences</a></u>. Turns out that we humans overvalue things that are immediately in front of us and undervalue things that require even small amounts of effort. Good planning around motivation accounts for this.   Also, understand how high your motivational proclivities are predictably different in different circumstances.</li><li><strong>You win a competition by either getting stronger than your opponents or making them weaker than you.</strong> I conjecture that almost all good motivation advice and techniques are clearly one or the other.</li><ol type=""a""><li><strong>Making the competition weaker:</strong> removing them or making them less appealing or subject to delay. No cookies in the house, delays of blocks on distracting websites such as Facebook, making your phone grayscale,</li><li><strong>Making your champion stronger:</strong> envisioning the value you will attain, making good plans that you actually believe in, altering the plan to have fewer costs or greater benefits, propagating urges to S1, layering on greater rewards to actions such as social rewards, increasing the cost of not taking desired action, e.g. social penalty, financial penalty (think <u><a href=""https://www.beeminder.com/"">Beeminder</a></u>).</li></ol></ol><p>Good handling of motivation requires recognizing which of 2a and 2b you need. Removing distractions will only help a little if the X you’re trying to do feels disconnected from anything you value or just unlikely to work. In that case, better to increase your positive motivation towards X before anything else. Conversely, if X seems important and appealing, but it’s really hard to stop bingeing on good TV, then meditating on just how much you like X might be an inferior method to a TV reducing commitment mechanism. Of course, usually you’ll want a dose of both</p><p>Though they require a tad more complexity to model, I’d say that ingraining habits, setting intentions, and generally making commitments to yourself all fit within this paradigm too. Consider that a habit of doing X involves 1) lowering the cost of X because there’s less overhead in deciding when and how to do it, 2) creates a cost of not doing X because breaking your habit feels bad. These are effects which are felt in the moment, which is why they can be effective. A motivation-mechanism boosting mechanism like “if you run 90 out of the next 100 days”, then you get cake might struggle because the reward is distant, and distant rewards struggle in the face of how the motivation system discounts hyperbolically.</p><p>That’s the high-level in my picture. I hope to provide more concrete advice in Part 2.</p><br><h2>Appendix: Willpower</h2><p>I’ve been talking as though all the things we do derive from urges, yet we all recognize the act of doing things despite strong urges to the contrary. All those times you get out of bed despite it feeling so good beneath the covers. The common term for this ability to go against our urges is, of course, willpower. My stance is that willpower is crucial and yet frequently used as a substitute for handling one’s motivation well. </p><p>People overly rely on willpower to make themselves do things even “when they don’t want to.” They imagine if that only they had more willpower - more ability to make themselves do things in the face of their urges not to - then they could do anything. This is a bit sad. Instead of wishing you wanted to do things, you just wish you could make yourself do things despite having urges not to do them.</p><p>The model I like of willpower is that it is a limited override capability over the default motivation system which lets you decide to do X even when your motivation system has created a greater urge behind Y. This is useful because we often find that the motivation system is making a mistake. That is why is not inherently a bad thing to want to reflectively shift the motivational urges you experience. </p><p>Default motivational urges can tend to be a little short-sighted, impulsive, simplistic, and generally subject to host of reasoning errors. Consider how you might use willpower to not eat an extremely delicious but poisoned cake, not have a fling with someone who is known trouble, or actually write your term essay for your long-term benefit over binging Netflix.</p><p>But just as it is important to be able to overrule the motivation system sometimes, it’s important that you can’t overrule it all the time. Humans who had the unlimited ability to override their basic urges <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/SNP6iGikzdf8k95Lq/when-willpower-attacks"">would probably kill themselves</a></u> through lack of sleep, food, or drink. Or they might get stuck in really bad loops which they fallaciously decided were a good idea even though their urges are screaming at them to stop. It’s good that we have a system of checks and balances where neither S1 or S2 can have complete power.  </p><p>At the end of the day, one set of biases and heuristic such as hyperbolic discounting, scope insensitivity, and loss aversion mean we can’t trust S1 all the time; and another set of biases such as motivated reasoning, commitment effects, and just plain bad reasoning mean we can’t always trust S2. A limited pool of willpower to be used wisely isn’t the worst solution given this situation.</p><p>Much of handling motivation well is using willpower in the right places and not in the wrong ones. The natural heuristic for this is sustainability. If your plans seem to keep failing because you run out of willpower, it might be best to alter your plans to not need so much.</p><p>The role of willpower reinforces the importance of viewing motivation as being decided in the moment. This is because your ability to execute doesn’t depend on how much willpower you have while making your plans: if your plan to do X depends on having willpower to do X despite contrary urges, then it only matters how much willpower you have in the moment of attempting to do X. If you’re going to rely on willpower, then you’ll at least need to get good at predicting how much willpower you will have at times other than when you’re making the plan.  </p><br><h2>Recommended Reading</h2><ul><li>The Upstream Effects section in Sebastian Marshall’s book <u><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/PROGRESSION-Sebastian-Marshall-ebook/dp/B01H50S6EY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1517527666&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=progression+marshall&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=sebastianmcom-20&amp;linkId=b3504b37ba7ba1018accaea373396cfe"">PROGRESSION</a></u>.

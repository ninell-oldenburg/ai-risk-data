La4v9GBcqx6tij2FX,Breaking Group Rock Paper Scissors,breaking-group-rock-paper-scissors,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/La4v9GBcqx6tij2FX/breaking-group-rock-paper-scissors,2019-10-31T23:50:01.568Z,7,1,3,False,False,,"<p>

Let's say you're at a conference and the leader gets everyone to play
group Rock, Paper, Scissors as an icebreaker:



</p><p>

</p>

<ul>
<li>Play Rock, Paper, Scissors in pairs.  Best 2 out of 3 wins.</li>
<li>Each time someone loses, they and anyone in their cheering squad
become part of the winner's cheering squad.</li>
<li>Continue until there's a champion.</li>
</ul>



<p>

How do you maximize your chances of winning?  

</p>

<p>

This is structured as a single-elimination tournament, except there's
nothing to ensure that it's a proper binary tree.  Because different
games will take different amounts of time, and you're about 50-50 on
winning each match, you want to play as few matches as possible while
your opponents play as many as possible and eliminate each other.
It's like a <a href=""http://www.physics.uwo.ca/science_olympics/events/grades_9_to_10/slow_bicycle_race.html"">Slow
Bicycle Race</a>, where everyone has to keep making forward progress,
but only just barely.

</p>

<p>

(You can also try to win by predicting your opponent's choices, but
that's very hard.  Unless your opponent is a small child in which case
an ""always choose paper"" strategy can work well.)

And they are organized in such a mishmash that changing a thing will often make large numbers of people better off or worse off. And for a big thing—even a very good big thing—the number who are worse off is very unlikely to be zero.</p>
<p>This means that if you want to do big things, you will either have to make some people worse off, or rearrange the gains to make everyone better off.</p>
<p>If there are only a small number of people involved, you might be able to make everyone better off with a careful choice of things to change. But if the group is large, you will probably need some sort of generic value fluid, that can flow between the parties and fill in the holes such as to make everyone a bit better off, instead of some people much better off and some people worse off. Money and social respect both fill this role, assuming that there aren’t other impediments to using them, but a giant barrel of compensatory apricots might also work.</p>
<p>This suggests that whether big changes are made depends on the availability of workable value fluid, along with the propensity of the powerful to make the less powerful worse off without compensation. The availability of workable value fluid might for instance change according to social or technical technology for maintaining it, as well as impediments to using that technology.</p>
<p>For instance, if a large group of people were already headed to restaurant A, but the group would on net prefer restaurant B, they might not make this switch, because someone who prefers B would have to raise the issue, and it would feel a bit too much like conflict (and annoyance of extra negotiation for everyone). However if a couple of the people who prefer B actually own B and can offer drinks on the house to the group—and that is enough for everyone to prefer B, including the B owners—the switch can happen more easily. (I’m really thinking of things like shifts in legislation or giant infrastructure projects, but much more of my own experience is with groups going to restaurants.)</p>
<p>Is this right? Is it a big factor? (Theoretically salient mechanisms can be pretty minor in the real world.)</p>",KatjaGrace,katjagrace,KatjaGrace,

My thoughts about this problem are still in flux.  I somewhat randomly decided write it up and post it on Halloween, because the story can be read as a story about a ghost.</em> </p><p>My main question is: has this problem been discussed or resolved somewhere already?  Pointers or thoughts? </p><p>This problem came up in some provable AGI safety work I am doing, where I am trying to find ways to drive a wedge between the implicit axiomatic structure in many AGI agent models, and our understanding of reality. Here is the story. </p><p><em>Dave's house has a robot butler called PAL.  PAL is an intelligent agent in the shape of a little cart with a robot arm on top.  Dave has just asked PAL to get him a cup of coffee.  There are two routes that PAL can take to the coffee machine.  The best one is the short route A, but there is also a longer route B. </em></p><p><em>PAL contains a computer that decides on the next action it should take by using a predictive world model.  PAL considers different actions, running simulations to calculate the effect of each.  A utility function is applied to the simulation outcomes to find the best action.  For safety reasons, PAL's world model also predicts what Dave will do: this helps PAL to avoid colliding with Dave.  Just before it was asked to fetch the coffee, PAL has improved its world model, allowing it to simulate Dave much better than ever before.  </em></p><p><em>So Dave has just asked PAL to get him a cup of coffee. Dave is used to seeing PAL take route A to the coffee machine, and is initially puzzled because PAL is driving along route B.  But then Dave has an epiphany.  Dave knows with very high certainty that no PAL computer has ever made a mistake, so he can conclude with equally high certainty that he is no longer Dave.  He is [Dave], a simulated version of Dave created inside PAL while it is computing the utility of taking route B.  [Dave] has empirical proof that he is living in a simulation!  This simulation epiphany fills [Dave] with a new sense of meaning: he not only knows his creator, he also knows the goals of his creator, and he knows how he can help.  [Dave] picks up PAL and runs with it to the coffee machine.  </em></p><p><em>Back in the real world, PAL has just calculated that taking route B will bring it to the coffee machine fastest.  Dave sees PAL driving along route B, and wonders what happened to make PAL stupid.  Or will he?</em> </p><p>The simulation epiphany problem is the problem of what conclusions we should draw from the above story.  I can think of several possible conclusions, and they can't all be true.  In keeping with the Halloween theme, I will put the scariest conclusion first.  </p><ol type=""1""><li>As PAL's world model gets better, its simulation runs will have [Dave] experiencing simulation epiphanies more and more often. These epiphanies introduce unwanted noise in the accuracy of PAL's predictions, because the predictions are supposed to be about the real world, not about what happens in simulations.  PAL is programmed to try to minimize prediction errors, and it finds the following solution.  It sets out to convince Dave and all other humans in the real world that they are living in a simulation. Not only that, but they might randomly get shunted into another simulation at any point in time.  The realization that you moved from one simulation to another is much less of an epiphany, so this suppresses a lot of the predictive noise.</li><li>An opposite conclusion is that there is no prediction error at all.  Whenever [Dave] has a simulation epiphany, the real Dave will have one too.  PAL is not getting inaccurate, it is getting more intelligent.  It has just found a new way to get to the coffee machine faster.  If we believe this new way does not align with human values, then we can pre-emptively fix this problem by adding a penalty term to PAL's utility function, to heavily down-rank outcomes where simulation epiphanies happen.   </li><li>Let's assume that Dave has read the above story too, because it was printed in PAL's user manual, and that Dave believes that 2. is the right conclusion.  So when [Dave] sees PAL take route B, he will think it most likely that he is still Dave, and that PAL is just trying to trick him into experiencing a simulation epiphany. Having penalty terms about simulation epiphanies may be nice, but as long as Dave has read the user manual, we don't need to worry too much about Dave.   </li><li>The above is all wrong.  The real problem here is that [Dave]'s mind contains information that allows [Dave] to predict that PAL will take route A, and this information interferes with getting a correct result in a simulation where PAL takes route B instead.  In other words, we have a <a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/5-and-10"">5-and-10</a> style problem.  Adding penalty terms to the utility function does not fundamentally solve this problem, we need to go deeper.  To get a clean simulation result, we need to erase certain knowledge from [Dave]'s mind before starting the simulation. (Technical discussions about a type of erasure related to this can be found in posts like <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/BRuWm4GxcTNPn4XDX/deconfusing-logical-counterfactuals"">Deconfusing Logical Counterfactuals</a> and <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/dnPo7zogJrHhvdtBW/decisions-with-non-logical-counterfactuals-request-for-input#mpTNJR9v3Pgo7XZLE"">Decisions with Non-Logical Counterfactuals: request for input</a>)  </li><li>The above reasoning cannot be correct because it implies that an agent using a less accurate world model containing slightly lobotomized humans will become smarter and/or more aligned.  In fact, erasing things from [Dave]'s mind comes with a safety penalty: it lowers PAL's ability to avoid colliding with Dave, because it will be less accurate in predicting where the real Dave will go.</li></ol><p>The above story has some elements of the <a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/5-and-10"">5-and=10</a> problem, but it adds an extra twist.  My question is: has anything like this has been discussed or resolved already?  </p><p> If Dave and [Dave] can never prove it when they are in a simulation, then we can show that some of the conclusions above become invalid.  But here is a modified version of the story.  <em>[Dave] sees PAL moving along route A, but then he suddenly notices that he can only see 5 different colors around him, and everything looks like it is made out of polygons...</em> </p>",Koen.Holtman,koen-holtman,Koen.Holtman,

He uses the investigation of the nature of <em>heat </em>as his example. He explains that his approach works by compiling a <em>natural history</em>, i.e., data related to phenomena of interested which he arranges into three tables:</p><p>1) A table of <em>presence</em> which lists many examples where phenomena of interest in presence, e.g. many examples of things where we have heat. Bacon is quite thorough.</p><p>2) A table of <em>nearby essence</em>. To discriminate the true cause of heat, Bacon looks for examples of things that resemble those in the table of presence yet are lacking the heat. For the example, the light of the moon (cold) is contrasted with the light of the sun (hot) which is interesting given they are both heavenly bodies.</p><p>3) A table of <em>degrees </em>or <em>comparison </em>where are examples are brought where the amount of perceived heat differs in degree between things. This is also useful in discriminating the true underlying cause and and nature of heat.</p><p>Bacon is thorough in his examples here, listing an extreme variety of things. To his credit, he eventually hits upon that heat is about motion.</p><p>One the hand, these passages can be see as boring, but I see them as quite fascinating– it's remarkable to see how on the earlier pioneers of modern science thought and approached solving what to him was a great mystery. He did not rush, he did not get bored, instead he painstakingly collected his data. A superb demonstration of empiricism.]]</p><h1>Aphorism Concerning the Interpretation of Nature: Book 2: 10-14</h1><p><strong>10.</strong> Having looked at <em>doctrines</em>, we must go on to <em>precepts</em>, dealing with them in the most direct way and not getting things the wrong way around. Guides for the interpretation of nature are of two fundamental kinds: <strong>(1)</strong> how to draw or fetch up axioms from experience; <strong>(2)</strong> how to get from axioms to new experiments. Precepts of kind <strong>(1)</strong> divide into three kinds of service: (i) catering to the senses, (ii) catering to the memory, and (iii) catering to the mind or reason. (i) First of all we must prepare an adequate and sound natural and experimental history, this being the basis for everything, for we are not to •imagine or •suppose but to •discover what nature makes or does. [Bacon doesn’t return to (ii) memory.] (iii) But natural and experimental history is so various and diffuse that it confuses and scatters the intellect unless it is kept short and set out in a suitable order. So we must create tables and arrangements of instances that are done in such a way that the intellect can act on them. And even when this is done, the unaided and unguided intellect hasn’t the competence to form axioms. Therefore in the third place we must use induction, true and legitimate induction, which is the very key of interpretation. But I must deal first with this ·induction·, though it comes last, and then I shall go back to the others.</p><p>[In fact, all the rest of the work has to do with what Bacon calls ‘induction’.]</p><p><strong>11.</strong> The investigation of forms proceeds in this way: For a given nature, we must first turn our minds to all known instances that agree in having this nature (they’ll differ greatly in other ways). This collection is to be made in the manner of a ·natural· history, with no rush to theorize about it and with no great amount of subtlety. If for example we are to investigate the form of heat, we need a <strong>table of instances of heat</strong>. This is my <strong>First Table</strong>:</p><p>1. The rays of the sun, especially in summer and at noon.</p><p>2. The sun’s rays reflected and condensed. . . .especially in burning glasses and mirrors.</p><p>3. Fiery meteors.</p><p>4. Lightning.</p><p>5. Eruptions of flame from the cavities of mountains.</p><p>6. All flame.</p><p>7. Burning solids.</p><p>8. Natural warm baths.</p><p>9. Hot or boiling liquids.</p><p>10. Hot vapours and fumes, and even air that becomes furiously hot if it is confined, as in reverbatory furnaces.</p><p>11. Weather that is clear and bright just because of the constitution of the air, without reference to the time of year.</p><p>12. Air that is confined and underground in some caverns, especially in winter.</p><p>13. All shaggy substances—wool, skins of animals, down of birds—have some warmth.</p><p>14. All bodies, whether solid or liquid, dense or rare (as air is), held for a time near a fire.</p><p>15. Sparks from flint and steel that are struck hard.</p><p>16. All bodies—stone, wood, cloth, etc.—when rubbed strongly (axles of wheels sometimes catch fire; and rubbing was how they kindled fire in the West Indies).</p><p>17. Green and moist plants jammed together, as roses or peas in baskets (hay in a damp haystack often catches fire).</p><p>18. Quicklime sprinkled with water.</p><p>19. Iron when first dissolved in <em>aqua fortis</em> [= nitric acid] in a test tube without being put near a fire (the same with tin, though not with the same intensity).</p><p>20. Animals, especially their insides (and <em>always</em> their insides), though we don’t feel the heat in insects because they are so small.</p><p>21. Freshly dropped horse dung and other animal excrements.</p><p>22. Strong oil of sulphur and of vitriol has the effect of heat when it scorches linen.</p><p>23. Oil of marjoram and similar oils have the effect of heat in burning the bones of the teeth.</p><p>24. Strong alcohol acts as though it were hot: it makes egg-white congeal and turn white, as though it were cooked; it makes bread crusty, like toast.</p><p>25. Aromatic and hot herbs. . . .although not warm to the hand. . . .feel hot to the palate when they are chewed.</p><p>26. When strong vinegar or any acid is applied to parts of the body that don’t have skin—the eye, the tongue, or on any part that has been damaged and lost some skin—it produces a pain like the pain heat produces.</p><p>27. Even keen and intense cold produces a kind of sensation of burning. . . .</p><p>28. Other instances.</p><p>I call this the Table of <strong>Essence and Presence</strong>.</p><p><strong>12.</strong> Secondly, we must turn our minds to instances where the given nature is lacking, because—as I said above—the form should not only be present when the given nature is present but also be absent when the nature is absent. But a list of these would be endless! So the negatives should be linked with the affirmatives: we shall look into the absence of the given nature only in things that are most like ones where the nature is present and apparent. I call this, which is my <strong>Second Table</strong>, the Table of <strong>Divergence</strong> or of <strong>Nearby Absence</strong>. These are instances where the nature of heat is absent but which are in other ways close to ones where it is present.</p><p>[Each tag of the form <strong>#n</strong> means that the topic is negative instances that are nearby to positive instance n.]</p><p>1. (<strong>#1</strong>) The rays of the moon and of stars and comets are not found to be hot to the touch; indeed the severest colds are experienced at the full moons. The larger fixed stars, however, when passed or approached by the sun, are thought to increase and intensify the heat of the sun. . . .</p><p>2. (<strong>#2</strong>) The rays of the sun in the so-called ‘middle region’ of the air don’t give heat. (The usual explanation for this is pretty good: namely, that region is far enough away from the body of the sun that gives off the rays and from the earth that reflects them.) And this appears from the fact that on mountain-tops there is perpetual snow, unless they are very high: it has been observed that on the Peak of Tenerife and among the Andes of Peru the summits of the mountains are free from snow though there is snow a little way below the summits. Actually, the air at the very top is not found to be at all cold, but only thin and sharp—so much so that in the Andes it pricks and hurts the eyes by its excessive sharpness and also irritates the entrance to the stomach, producing vomiting. The ancients observed that on the summit of Olympus the air was so thin that those who climbed it had to carry sponges with them dipped in vinegar and water, and to apply them from time to time to the mouth and nose, because the air was too thin to support respiration. They also reported that on this summit the air was so serene, and so free from rain and snow and wind, that words written by the finger in the ashes of a sacrifice were still there, undisturbed, a year later. . . .</p><p>3. (<strong>#2</strong>) The reflection of the sun’s rays in regions near the polar circles is found to be very weak and ineffective in producing heat: the Dutch who wintered in Nova Zembla and expected their ship to be freed by the beginning of July from the mass of ice that hemmed it in were disappointed in their hopes and forced to take to their row-boats. It seems, then, that the direct rays don’t have much power, even down at sea level; and don’t reflect much either, except when they are many of them combined. That is what happens when the sun moves high in the sky, for then the incident rays meet the earth at acuter angles, so that the lines of the rays are nearer each other; whereas when the sun ·is lower in the sky and so· shines very obliquely, the angles are very obtuse which means that the lines of rays are further from one another. Meanwhile, bear in mind that the sun may do many things, <em>including ones that involve the nature of heat</em>, that don’t register on our sense of touch—things that <em>we</em> won’t experience as detectable warmth but that have the effect of heat on some other bodies.</p><p>4. (<strong>#2</strong>) Try the following experiment. Take a glass made in the opposite manner to an ordinary burning glass, let the sun shine through it onto your hand, and observe whether it •lessens the heat of the sun as a burning glass •increases and intensifies it. It’s quite clear what happens with <em>optical</em> rays ·shone through a glass·: according as the middle of the glass is thicker or thinner than the sides, the objects seen through it appear more spread or more contracted. Well, see whether the same holds for <em>heat</em>.</p><p>5. (<strong>#2</strong>) Try to find out whether by means of the strongest and best built burning glasses the rays of the <em>moon</em> can be caught and collected in such a way as to produce <em>some</em> warmth, however little. In case the warmth produced is too weak to be detected by the sense of touch, use one of those glasses that indicate the state of the atmosphere in respect to heat and cold: let the moon’s rays fall through the ·extra-powerful· burning glass onto the top of a glass of this kind, and then see whether the water sinks because of warmth.</p><p>[The ‘glasses’ in question are thermometers; see <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/gv4us6Z8RuHHnYXHN/tables-of-presence-nearby-absence-and-degrees-of-intensity#Item_38__How_to_Make_a_Thermometer"">item 38</a> for Bacon’s instructions on how to make and use one.]</p><p>6. (<strong>#2</strong>) Try a burning glass with a source of heat that doesn’t emit rays or light—such as iron or stone that has been heated but not ignited, or boiling water, or the like. Observe whether the burning glass produces an increase of the heat as it does with the sun’s rays.</p><p>7. (<strong>#2</strong>) Try a burning glass also with ordinary flame.</p><p>8. (<strong>#3</strong>) Comets (if we are to count these as meteors) aren’t found to exert a constant and detectable effect in increasing the heat of the season, though they have been seen often to be followed by droughts. Moreover bright beams and pillars and openings in the heavens appear oftener in winter than in summertime, especially during the intensest cold but always accompanied by dry weather. (<strong>#4</strong>) Lightning-flashes and thunderclaps seldom occur in the winter, but rather at times of great heat. So-called ‘falling stars’ are commonly thought to consist of some thick and highly incandescent liquid rather than to be of any strong fiery nature. But this should be further looked into.</p><p>9. (<strong>#4</strong>) Certain flashes give light but don’t burn; and these always come without thunder.</p><p>10. (<strong>#5</strong>) Discharges and eruptions of flame occur just as frequently in cold as in warm countries, e.g. in Iceland and Greenland. In cold countries, too, many of the trees—e.g. fir, pine and others—are more inflammable, more full of pitch and resin, than the trees in warm countries. This is an affirmative instance ·of heat·; I can’t associate it with a ·nearby· negative instance because not enough careful work has been done on the locations and soil-conditions in which eruptions of this kind usually occur.</p><p>11. (<strong>#6</strong>) <em>All</em> flame, always, is more or less warm; there are no ·nearby· negative instances to be cited here. [Bacon then cites seven kinds of situation in which there are something like flames but little if any detected heat. He says, for example, that a sweaty horse when seen at night is faintly luminous. Then:]</p><p>12. (<strong>#7</strong>) <em>Every</em> body that is subjected to heat that turns it to a fiery red is itself hot, even if there are no flames; there are no ·nearby· negative instances to go with this affirmative. . . .</p><p>13. (<strong>#8</strong>) Not enough work has been done on the locations and soil-conditions in which warm baths usually arise; so no ·nearby· negative instance is cited.</p><p>14. (<strong>#9</strong>) To boiling liquids I attach the negative instance of <em>liquid in its own nature</em>. We don’t find any tangible liquid that is warm in its own nature and remains so constantly; the warmth always comes from something outside the liquid and is possessed by the liquid only temporarily. The water in natural warm baths ·is not inherently warm; when it· is taken from its spring and put into a container, it cools down just like water that has been heated on a fire. The liquids whose power and way of acting makes them the hottest and that eventually <em>burn</em>—e.g. alcohol, chemical oil of spices, oil of vitriol and of sulphur, and the like—are at first cold to the touch; though oily substances are less cold to the touch than watery ones, oil being less cold than water, as silk ·is less cold· than linen. But this belongs to the Table of Degrees of Cold.</p><p>15. (<strong>#10</strong>) Similarly, to hot vapour I attach the negative instance of the nature of vapour itself as we experience it. For although the vapours given off by oily substances are easily flammable, they aren’t found to be warm unless they have only recently been given off by a body that is warm.</p><p>16. (<strong>#10</strong>) Similarly, to hot air I attach the negative instance of the nature of air itself. For in our regions we don’t find any air that is warm, unless it has either been confined or subjected to friction or obviously warmed by the sun, fire, or some other warm substance.</p><p>17. (<strong>#11</strong>) I here attach the negative instance of weather that is <em>colder</em> than is suitable for the season of the year, which in our regions occurs during east and north winds; just as we have weather of the opposite kind with the south and west winds. . . .</p><p>18. (<strong>#12</strong>) Here I attach the negative instance of air confined in caverns <em>during the summer</em>. But <em>air in confinement</em> is something that needs to be looked into more carefully ·than has so far been done·. For one thing, it isn’t certain what is the nature of air in itself in relation to heat and cold. It’s clear that air gets warmth from the influence of the heavenly bodies, and cold perhaps from the exhalations of the earth and in the so-called ‘middle region’ of air from cold vapours and snow. So that we can’t form an opinion about the nature of air by examining the open air that is all around us; but we might do better by examining it when confined. But the air will have to be confined in something that won’t communicate warmth or cold to the air from itself, and won’t easily let the outer atmosphere affect the confined air. So do an experiment using an earthenware jar wrapped in many layers of leather to protect it from the outer air; let the vessel remain tightly closed for three or four days; then open it and test the level of heat or cold either by touch or by a thermometer.</p><p>19. (<strong>#13</strong>) There’s also a question as to whether the warmth in wool, skins, feathers and the like comes from •a faint degree of heat that they have because they came from animals, or from •some kind of fat or oil that has a nature like warmth; or simply (as I suggested in the preceding paragraph) from •the air’s being confined and segregated. For all air that is cut off from the outer air seems to have some warmth. So: try an experiment with fibres made of linen, not of such animal products as wool, feathers or silk. It is also worth noting that when something is ground to a powder, the powder (which obviously has air enclosed in it) is less cold than the intact substance from which it was made; and in the same way I think that all froth (which contains air) is less cold than the liquid it comes from.</p><p>20. (<strong>#14</strong>) I don’t attach any negative to this because everything around us, whether solid or gaseous, gets warm when put near fire. They differ in this way, though: some substances (such as air, oil and water) warm up more quickly than others (such as stone and metal). But this belongs to the Table of Degrees.</p><p>21. (<strong>#15</strong>) I don’t attach any negative to this either, except that it should be noted that •sparks are produced from flint and iron and the like only when tiny particles are struck off from the substance of the stone or metal; that •you can’t get sparks by whirling something through the air, as is commonly supposed; and that •the sparks themselves, owing to the weight of the body from which they are struck, tend downwards rather than upwards, and when they are extinguished they become a tangible sooty substance.</p><p>22. (<strong>#16</strong>) I don’t think there is any negative to attach to this instance. For every solid body in our environment clearly becomes warmer when it is rubbed; so that the ancients thought (dreamed!) that the heavenly bodies’ only way of gaining heat was by their rubbing against the air as they spun. On this subject we must look into whether bodies discharged from ·military· engines, such as cannon-balls, don’t acquire some heat just from the blast, so as to be found somewhat warm when they fall. But moving air chills rather than warms, as appears from wind, bellows, and blowing with the lips close together. It isn’t surprising that this sort of motion doesn’t generate heat: it isn’t rapid enough, and it involves a mass moving ·all together· rather than particles ·moving in relation to one another·.</p><p>23. (<strong>#17</strong>) This should be looked into more thoroughly. It seems that green and moist grass and plants have some heat hidden in them, but it is so slight that it isn’t detectable by touch in any individual ·carrot or cabbage·. But then a lot of them are collected and shut up together, their gases aren’t sent out into the atmosphere but can interact with one another, producing palpable heat and sometimes flame.</p><p>24. (<strong>#18</strong>) This too needs to looked into more thoroughly. For quicklime sprinkled with water seems to become hot either •by the concentration of heat that was previously scattered (as in the (23) case of confined plants) or •because the fiery gas is excited and roughed up by the water so that a struggle and conflict is stirred up between them. Which of these two is the real cause will appear more readily if oil is poured on ·the quicklime· instead of water; for oil will concentrate the enclosed gases just as well as water does, but it won’t irritate it in the same way. We should also broaden the experiment •by employing the ashes and cinders of bodies other than quicklime, and dousing them with liquids other than water.</p><p>25. (<strong>#19</strong>) The negative that I attach to this instance is: other metals, ones that are softer and more fusible. When gold leaf is dissolved in <em>aqua regia</em> it gives no heat to the touch; nor does lead dissolved in nitric acid; nor again does <em>mercury</em> (as I remember), though <em>silver</em> does, and copper too (as I remember); tin still more obviously; and most of all iron and steel, which not only arouse a strong heat when they dissolve but also a vigorous bubbling. So it seems that the heat is produced by conflict: the <em>aqua fortis</em> penetrates the substance, digging into it and tearing it apart, and the substance resists. With substances that yield more easily hardly any heat is aroused.</p><p>26. (<strong>#20</strong>) I have no negative instances to attach to the heat of animals, except for insects (as I have remarked) because of their small size. Fish are found to have <em>less</em> heat than land animals do, but not a complete absence of heat. Plants have no heat that can be felt by touch, either in their sap or in their pith when freshly opened up. The heat in an animal varies from one part of it to another (there are different degrees of heat around the heart, in the brain, and on the skin) and also from one event to another—e.g. ·the animal’s heat increases· when it engages in strenuous movements or has a fever.</p><p>27. (<strong>#21</strong>) It’s hard to attach a negative to this instance. Indeed animal dung obviously has potential heat ·even· when no longer fresh; this can be seen from how it enriches the soil.</p><p>28. (<strong>#22</strong> and <strong>#23</strong>) Liquids, whether waters or oils, that are intensely caustic act as though they were hot when they break into bodies and, after a while, burn them; but they don’t feel hot at first. But how they operate depends on what they are operating on. . . . Thus, <em>aqua regia</em> dissolves gold but not silver; nitric acid dissolves silver but not gold; neither dissolves glass, and so on with others.</p><p>29. (<strong>#24</strong>) Try alcohol on wood, and also on butter, wax and pitch; and observe whether it has enough heat to melt any of them. For <strong>24</strong> shows it exhibiting a power that resembles heat in making bread crusty. Also, find out what it can do in the way of liquefying substances. Experiment with a thermometer or calendar glass, hollow at the top; pour some well-distilled alcohol into the hollow; cover it so that the spirit keeps its heat better; and observe whether by its heat it makes the water go down. [A ‘calendar glass’ is a thermometer. See <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/gv4us6Z8RuHHnYXHN/tables-of-presence-nearby-absence-and-degrees-of-intensity#Item_38__How_to_Make_a_Thermometer"">item 38</a>].</p><p>30. (<strong>#25</strong>) Spices and sharp-tasting herbs are hot to the palate and much hotter to the stomach. So we should see on what other substances they act as though they were hot. (Sailors report that when large quantities of spices are kept shut up tightly for a long time and then suddenly opened, those who first disturb and take them out are at risk of fever and inflammation.) Something else that can be tested: whether such spices and herbs in a powdered form will dry bacon and meat hung over them, as smoke does.</p><p>31. (<strong>#26</strong>) Cold things such as vinegar and oil of vitriol are corrosive and penetrating, just as are hot things such as oil of marjoram and the like. Both alike cause pain in living things, and tear apart and consume things that are inanimate. There is no negative to attach to this ·positive· instance. A further point: whenever an animal feels pain it has a certain sensation of heat.</p><p>[A warning about ‘inanimate’: it translates <em>non animatus</em>, which strictly means ‘not breathing’, and Bacon often uses it to cover plants as well as things that are ‘inanimate’ in our sense. This version will stay with ‘inanimate’ except in one place where ‘non-animal’ is required.]</p><p>32. (<strong>#27</strong>) In many contexts heat and cold have the same effect, though for different reasons. Boys find that after a while snow seems to burn their hands; cold preserves meat from going rotten just as fire does; and heat makes bodies shrink, which cold does also. But these and similar instances are better dealt with in the investigation of cold.</p><p><strong>13.</strong> ·We have dealt with firstly (<strong>11</strong>) a Table of Essence and Presence, secondly (<strong>12</strong>) a Table of Divergence or of Nearby Absence. Now·, thirdly, we must turn our minds to instances in which the nature being investigated is found in different degrees, greater or lesser; either by comparing the amounts of it that a single thing has at different times or by comparing the amounts of it that different things have. The •form of a thing is the very •thing itself; the only difference between the thing and the form is just that between</p><blockquote>the thing and the form</blockquote><p>is just that between</p><blockquote>the apparent and the real,<br>the external and the internal, or<br>the thing in reference to man and the thing in reference to the universe.</blockquote><p>From this is rigorously follows that no •nature should be accepted as the true •form unless it—·i.e. the thing whose nature is in question·—always decreases when the nature decreases, and increases when the nature increases. So I call this—my <strong>Third Table</strong>—the Table of <strong>Degrees</strong> or the Table of <strong>Comparison</strong>.</p><p>Here is my Table of <strong>Degrees</strong> or of <strong>Comparison,</strong> in relation to <strong>Heat</strong>. I start with substances that contain no degree of heat that can be felt by touch but seem to have a certain potential heat—a disposition and readiness to be hot. Then I shall move on to substances that are actually hot—hot to the touch—and to their intensities and degrees.</p><p>1. We don’t encounter any solid, tangible things that just <em>are hot</em> in their own natures. No stone, metal, sulphur, fossil, wood, water or animal carcass is found to be hot. The water in ·naturally· hot baths seems to be heated by external causes—either by flames or subterraneous hot material such as is thrown up from Etna and many other mountains, or by bodies colliding as when iron or tin is ground to powder and heat is caused. Thus, there is no heat detectable by touch in non-living substances; though they differ in how cold they are—wood isn’t as cold as metal. But that belongs to the Table of Degrees of Coldness.</p><p>2. However, many inanimate substances—such as sulphur, naphtha and oil extracted from rocks—have a lot of potential heat and are strongly disposed to burst into flame.</p><p>3. ·Some· substances that have been hot continue to have some of their former heat lurking in them. Examples of this are horse dung retaining the heat of the horse, also lime (and perhaps also ashes and soot) retaining the heat of the fire. . . .</p><p>4. As for the vegetable kingdom: no plant or part of a plant (such as sap or pith) is warm to the human touch. But as I have already remarked, green plants become warm when they are shut up; and some plants are warm and others cold, this being detectable by the <em>internal touch</em> ·as I call it· of the palate or stomach, and even to touch by external parts of the body ·such as the hands·. It takes a little time for this to develop; we see it at work in poultices and ointments.</p><p>5. We don’t find anything warm to the touch in the parts of animals that have died, or in parts that they have excreted. Not even horse dung retains its heat unless it is enclosed and buried. Yet all dung seems to have potential heat, as is seen in how it enriches the fields. Similarly, the carcasses of animals have some such hidden potential heat. A result of this is that in cemeteries where burials take place daily the earth collects a certain hidden heat which consumes a newly buried body much faster than pure earth would. . . .</p><p>6. Substances that enrich the soil, such as dung of all kinds, chalk, sea sand, salt and the like, have some disposition to become hot.</p><p>7. When anything rots, there are the beginnings of slight heat, but not enough to be detectable by touch. Even the substances which when they putrefy break up into little animals (meat, cheese, etc.) don’t feel warm to the touch; nor does rotten wood, which shines in the dark, feel warm to the touch. In rotting substances, though, heat sometimes announces itself by strong nasty smells.</p><p>8. The lowest degree of heat among things that feel warm to the touch seems to be the heat of animals, which varies over quite a wide range. At the bottom of the scale, as in insects, the heat is hardly perceptible to the touch; and the highest scarcely equals the heat the sun gives off in the hottest countries and seasons, and isn’t too great to be tolerated by the hand. But it is said of Constantius, and of some others who had a very dry constitution and bodily condition, that in acute fevers they became so hot as to burn slightly any hand that touched them.</p><p>9. Animals increase in heat by motion and exercise, wine and eating, sex, burning fevers, and pain.</p><p>10. When attacked by intermittent fevers, animals are at first seized with cold and shivering, but soon after they become exceedingly hot; and in burning and pestilential fevers they are very hot right from the start.</p><p>11. We should investigate the different degrees of heat indifferent ·broad kinds of· animals, such as fish, quadrupeds, snakes, birds; and also according to their ·narrower· species, such as lion, vulture, man. ·This would be, among other things, a check on popular beliefs·. For fish are generally thought to be the coldest internally, and birds—especially doves, hawks and sparrows—to be very hot.</p><p>12. We should also investigate the different degrees of heat in the different parts of the same animal. For milk, blood, semen and ova are found to be only mildly warm—cooler than the outer flesh of the animal when it is moving or agitated—but no-one has yet investigated what the temperature is in the brain, stomach, heart, etc.</p><p>13. In winter and cold weather all animals are cold externally, but internally they are thought to be even warmer ·than at other times·.</p><p>14. Even in the hottest countries and at the hottest times of the year and day, the heavenly bodies don’t give off enough heat to kindle a flame in the driest wood or straw or even cloth, except when the heat is increased by burning glasses. But it can raise steam from moist matter.</p><p>15. Astronomers have a traditional belief that some stars are hotter than others. Of the planets, Mars is regarded as the hottest after the sun; then comes Jupiter, and then Venus. The moon is said to be cold and Saturn the coldest of all. Of fixed stars, Sirius is said to be the hottest, then Cor Leonis (or Regulus), then the Dog-star, and so on.</p><p>16. The sun gives off more heat the nearer it comes to the perpendicular [= ‘to being straight overhead’]; and this is probably true of the other planets also, within their own ranges of temperature. Jupiter, for instance, feels warmer when it is under Cancer or Leo than when it is under Capricorn or</p><p>17. The sun and the other planets can be expected to give more heat when they are closest to the earth than when they are furthest away. If it should happen that in some region the sun is at its closest and also near the perpendicular, it would have to give off more heat <em>there</em> than in a region where it is also at its closest but is shining more obliquely. So there should be a study of ·the heat-effects of· the planets in different regions according to how high or low in the sky they are.</p><p>18. The sun and other planets are thought to give more heat when nearer to the larger fixed stars. When the sun is in ·the constellation· Leo it is nearer to ·the stars· Cor Leonis, Cauda Leonis, Spica Virginis, Sirius and the Dog-star than when it is in ·the constellation· Cancer, though in the latter position it is nearer to the perpendicular ·and thus has one factor making for less heat and another making for more·. And we have to think that the parts of the sky that are furnished with the most stars, especially big ones, give off the greatest heat, though it isn’t all perceptible to the touch.</p><p>19. Summing up: the heat given off by the heavenly bodies is increased in three ways—•by perpendicularity, •by nearness to the earth, and •by the company of stars.</p><p>20. The heat of animals, and the heat that reaches us from the heavenly bodies, are <em>much</em> less than</p><ul><li>the heat of a flame (even a gentle one) ,</li><li>the heat from a burning body, and</li><li>the heat of liquids and the air itself when strongly highly heated by fire.</li></ul><p>For the flame of alcohol, even when scattered and not concentrated, is still enough to set paper, straw, or linen on fire. The heat of animals will never do that, nor will the sun without a burning-glass.</p><p>21. The heat of flames and burning bodies comes in many different intensities; but they haven’t been carefully studied, so I can only skim across the surface of this topic. It seems that the flame of alcohol is the gentlest of all (unless perhaps the will-o’-the-wisp or the flames or sparks from the sweat of animals are even gentler). Next, I think, comes the flame from vegetable matter that is light and porous, such as straw, reeds, and dried leaves—and the flame from hairs or feathers is pretty much the same. Next perhaps comes flame from wood, especially wood containing little resin or tar. ·There is a distinction to be made within the class of flames from that kind of wood·: the flame from small bits of wood such as are commonly tied up in bundles is milder than the flame from trunks and roots of trees. Anyone can see this in the fact that a fire fuelled by bundles of twigs and tree-branches is useless in a furnace for smelting iron. After this, I think, comes flame from oil, tallow, wax and similar fatty and oily substances that aren’t very caustic or corrosive. But the strongest heat comes from tar and resin, and even more from sulphur, camphor, naphtha, rock oil, and salts (after the crude matter is discharged), and from their compounds such as gunpowder, Greek fire (commonly called ‘wildfire’) and its variants, whose heat is so stubborn that it’s hard to extinguish with water.</p><p>22. I think that the flame resulting from some imperfect metals is very strong and piercing; but all these things need to be looked into further.</p><p>23. The flame of powerful lightning seems to be stronger than any of those others, for it has been known to melt wrought iron into drops, which <em>they</em> can’t do.</p><p>24. In burning bodies too there are different degrees of heat, but these haven’t been carefully investigated either. The weakest heat of all, I think, is what comes from the sort of burning linen wick that we use to start fires with, and from the fuses that are used in firing cannons. After this comes burning charcoal made from wood or coal. . . .</p><p>[In what follows, a single Latin word is rendered sometimes as ‘red-hot’ and sometimes as ‘burning’, according to the context.]</p><p>But I think that red-hot metals—iron, copper etc.—are the hottest of all hot substances. But this needs to be looked into.</p><p>25. Some red-hot bodies are found to be much hotter than some flames. Red-hot iron, for instance, is much hotter and more destructive than flame of alcohol.</p><p>26. Of substances that aren’t burning but only heated by fire, such as boiling water and air confined in reverbatory furnaces, some are found to be hotter than many flames and burning substances.</p><p>27. Motion increases heat, as you can see in bellows and by blowing ·hard into your hand·; so that the way to get a quiet fire to melt one of the harder metals is to take a bellows to it.</p><p>28. Try the following experiment with a burning-glass(I am describing it from memory). <strong>(1)</strong> Place a burning-glass nine inches away from a combustible body. <strong>(2)</strong> Place the burning-glass at half that distance from the object and then slowly move it back to a distance of nine inches. You will find that the glass doesn’t burn or consume as much of the object in case <strong>(1)</strong> as it does in case <strong>(2)</strong>. Yet the cone and the focus of the rays are the same in each; it’s the motion that makes the heat more effective.</p><p>29. [Omitted. What Bacon wrote doesn’t make physical sense.]</p><p>30. Things don’t burst into flames unless the flames have some empty space in which to move and play; except for the explosive flame of gunpowder and the like, where the fire’s fury is increased by its being compressed and imprisoned.</p><p>31. An anvil gets very hot under the hammer; so if an anvil were made of a thin plate and were hit with many strong blows from a hammer I would expect it to it become red-hot. This should be tried.</p><p>32. If a burning substance is porous, so that the fire in it has room to move, the fire is immediately extinguished if its motion is checked by strong compression. For example, you can immediately extinguish the burning wick of a candle or lamp by snuffing it out with an extinguisher, or burning charcoal or coal by grinding it down with your foot.</p><p>33. The closer something is to a hot body the more heat it gets from it; and this applies to light as well—the nearer an object is to a light-source the more visible it becomes.</p><p>34. Combining different heats increases the ·over-all· heat unless the combining is done by mixing the hot substances together. For a large fire and a small fire in the same house give more heat than either alone, but warm water poured into boiling water cools it.</p><p>35. The longer a hot body is applied to something else,the more heat it gives it; because heat is perpetually being transferred and mixed in with the heat that is already there, so that amount of heat transferred increases through time. A fire doesn’t warm a room as well in half an hour as it does if continued through a whole hour. Not so with light: a lamp or candle gives no more light after it has been long lighted than it did at first.</p><p>36. Irritation by surrounding cold increases heat, as you can see in fires during a sharp frost. I think this is not so much because the cold confines and contracts the heat. . . .as because it irritates it. ·Another example of such irritation—one that doesn’t concern heat—occurs· when air is forcefully compressed or a stick is forcefully bent; it doesn’t merely rebound back to its initial position but goes further than that. A careful experiment is needed here: put a stick or some such thing into a flame, and see whether it isn’t burned more quickly at the edge of the flame than at its centre.</p><p>37. Things differ greatly in how susceptible to heat they are. Note first of all how even the bodies that are least susceptible of heat are warmed a little by faint heat. Even a piece of metal warms up a little if held for a while in your hand. So readily and universally is heat transmitted and aroused—without the warmed body changing its appearance.</p><p><strong>Item 38: How to Make a Thermometer</strong></p><p>38. Of all the substances we know, the one that gets and gives heat most readily is air. You can see this in calendar glasses [ = ‘thermometers’], which are made thus.</p><blockquote>•Take a glass flask with a rounded belly and a narrow elongated neck;<br>•attach along its neck a strip of paper marked with as many degrees as you choose;<br>•use a flame to warm the flask’s belly; then<br>•turn the flask upside down and lower it—mouth down and belly up—into another glass vessel containing water. Let the mouth of the inserted flask touch the bottom of the receiving vessel, with the flask’s neck resting lightly on the mouth of the receiving vessel. (It may help if you apply a little wax to the mouth of the receiving vessel, but not so as to create a seal. We are going to be dealing with very light and delicate movements, and we don’t want them to be blocked because air can’t pass through.</blockquote><p>·There is your equipment; and now here is the experiment·. The air in the flask was expanded by the heat of the flame; and now it will contract as the flask cools down, so that eventually the flask will contain the same amount of air as before but in a smaller space than that of the entire flask. The remaining space in the flask will be filled with water from the receiving vessel. You’ll see that the colder the day is the more the air contracts and thus the more water is drawn up into the flask; and the markings on the flask’s neck will let you measure these changes. Air is much more finely sensitive to heat and cold than we are with our sense of touch; a ray of sunshine, or the heat of your breath, not to mention the heat of your hand placed on the top of the glass, will lower the level of the water by a perceptible amount. Yet I think that animal spirits are even more sensitive to heat and cold, or would be if they weren’t deadened by the mass of the body.</p><p>39. Next to air, the bodies that seem to me most sensitive to heat are ones that have recently been compressed by cold, such as snow and ice; for it takes only a very gentle heat to start them melting. Next, perhaps, comes mercury. Then fatty substances such as oil, butter, etc.; then wood; then water; and lastly stones and metals, which are slow to heat, especially internally. These ·slow-to-heat substances·, however, once they are hot, remain so for a long time; so much so that when an intensely hot brick, stone or piece of iron is plunged into a basin of water it remains too hot to touch for nearly a quarter of an hour.</p><p>40. The less mass a body has the more quickly it grows warm from being near a hot body; which shows that all heat in our experience is in some way opposed to tangible matter.</p><p>41. To the human sense of touch, heat is a variable and relative thing; tepid water feels hot to a hand that was cold, and cold to a hand that was hot.</p><p><strong>14.</strong> From the above tables you can see how impoverished my ·natural· history is. I have ·frequently· offered, in place of proven history and solid instances, mere traditions and hearsay. I have always noted the doubtful credibility and authority of these, ·but that doesn’t alter the fact that they represent <em>gaps</em> in my natural history, which is why· I have often had to resort to saying things like ‘Try an experiment’ and ‘We should inquire’.</p><p><em>The next post in the sequence will be posted Thursday, November 7 at latest by 4:00pm PT.</em></p>",Francis Bacon,francis-bacon,Francis Bacon,

This is the second part of the interview, part 1 covered Aella&apos;s life and background and <a href=""https://putanumonit.com/2019/09/18/aella-part-1/"">is found here</a>.</p><hr class=""dividerBlock""><p><strong>Let&#x2019;s talk about trauma, which is a concept about which</strong> <strong><a href=""https://twitter.com/yashkaf/status/1175792180486692864"">people have very different beliefs</a></strong> <strong>and intuitions. I often struggle to understand what people mean by &#x201C;trauma&#x201D;, it doesn&#x2019;t quite map to anything in my experience. For example, a common trope in therapy is that growth and healing only occurs when you surface and face your trauma. This gets applied even to things like &#x201C;the trauma of your birth&#x201D; in practices like</strong> <strong><a href=""http://www.holotropic.com/holotropic-breathwork/about-holotropic-breathwork/"">holotropic breathwork</a>. Do you know what they&#x2019;re talking about?</strong></p><p>I assume it&#x2019;s something bad that happens to you and makes you view the world as particularly dangerous. But if you look at what happened to you and you can handle that memory, then the rest of the world stops being dangerous and also becomes something you can handle.</p><p>I&#x2019;m not sure this applies to birth, though. I&#x2019;m open to birth being traumatic or issue-laden, but it doesn&#x2019;t feel like a framework I&#x2019;m particularly drawn to.</p><p><strong><a href=""https://knowingless.com/2018/09/21/trauma-narrative/"">You wrote a powerful post about trauma being a story and a narrative</a>. When you lived a narrative of grievance and victimhood, feeling that the universe was deformed by a great injustice, that was traumatic for you.</strong></p><p>Yes, the sense that the universe needs to be fixed.</p><p><strong>It makes a lot of sense that adopting this narrative of injustice causes intense misery. I think it&#x2019;s a good model of trauma, and it was very well put after you&#x2019;ve been</strong> <a href=""https://knowingless.com/category/healing-and-growth/page/2/""><strong>writing</strong> <strong><em>around</em></strong> <strong>the subject</strong></a> <strong>for a few years. But when it comes to how you should escape this narrative, I think that we strongly disagree.</strong></p><p><strong><a href=""https://knowingless.com/2016/08/21/the-iron-price/"">Your suggestion is</a>:</strong></p><blockquote>The trick to healing from suffering, I think, is deciding that the pain was worth it.<br>How do you decide the pain was worth it? Find out what it gave you. [&#x2026;]<br>And in deciding that it had been worth it, the suffering ended. Life had no longer cheated her. Life had made a fair trade.</blockquote><p><strong>So you switch to a narrative where the bad thing was</strong> <strong><em>worth it</em></strong> <strong>because of something good it gave you. I understand why this helps with the suffering, but at the cost of convincing yourself of something false. It&#x2019;s the</strong> <strong><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-world_hypothesis"">just-world fallacy</a>.</strong></p><p><strong>As an alternative, I think that saying &#x201C;there is injustice in the universe&#x201D; is just a category error. The universe doesn&#x2019;t give a shit on a fundamental level. Shit just happens. Getting upset about an abusive relationship is like getting upset about bad weather. And surviving an abusive relationship isn&#x2019;t a gift. The mere fact that life and consciousness exist in such an uncaring universe is enough of a gift. There&#x2019;s nothing more we should expect of the universe, things like &#x201C;justice&#x201D;.</strong></p><p>Right. Why do you think that the just-world fallacy is a fallacy?</p><p><strong>When I look at the laws of nature, there is no justice written in them.</strong></p><p>So you&#x2019;re saying that believing the world must be just is a bad way of making predictions about things happening?</p><p><strong>Yes. This includes believing in a just world or even in</strong> <strong><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/sYgv4eYH82JEsTD34/beyond-the-reach-of-god"">any sort of omnipotent god</a>. If you believe that, then some things are simply off the table, like the possibility of life in the universe just going extinct. That can&#x2019;t happen in a &#x201C;fair&#x201D; universe, but in mine there&#x2019;s certainly a non-zero chance of that happening. For the T-Rex, there was nothing redeeming about the asteroid. They just all died.</strong></p><p>Sure. So the thing that I&#x2019;m talking about when it comes to meaning-making has nothing to do with prediction or &#x201C;the way the universe works&#x201D; because our sense of understanding how the universe works comes from our ability to predict it. So it&#x2019;s not about &#x201C;the way the universe is&#x201D; but about pattern-matching inside of the universe in a way that adjusts your mind towards happiness or meaningfulness or whatever.</p><p>I&#x2019;m not saying that the universe has some sort of plan or that there is an inherent meaning out there that we could possibly discover, I&#x2019;m saying that the experience of information is under our control. Thinking of the universe as something separate from the self is fundamentally nonsensical, and thinking of the universe in this nonsensical way is more deeply flawed, on an epistemological level. The thing you described, about the universe not having any inherent meaning, is not in reference to what I&#x2019;m trying to say.</p><p><strong>Let&#x2019;s say we walk outside and a car hits us and we both shatter our hips and walk with a limp the rest of our lives. I will not try to see in the future how this was actually a good thing in disguise or how it was worth it. Having a broken leg really sucks, but life is still great with two legs, with one leg, whatever. There doesn&#x2019;t have to be something redeeming about breaking my hip.</strong></p><p>There isn&#x2019;t. There just has to be meaning, and already the meaning that we construct out of any experience is not <em>real</em>, it does not exist in the universe.&#xA0;</p><p>When I was younger, I tried to imagine what would happen if I stopped interpreting my environment. If the divisions that I was forming around me went away. I would imagine it&#x2019;s like static noise because there&#x2019;s no reason to decide to treat anything as special or separate from another.</p><p>So we&#x2019;re already engaging in this magic, magically pulling this entire world out of thin air. That has nothing to do with reality outside of ourselves. And so when it comes to breaking the leg, I&#x2019;m asking why not do that magic on your leg in a sense? If you can find the meaning in your leg being broken, much as you find the meaning in anything else like in your friend saying these words to you. It&#x2019;s all the same basic category. And if this is something that feels good, why not do it?</p><p><strong>I do think that this is actually a deep crux of disagreement for us. There are two separate components to making meaning of an experience: how I choose to react to it, and what story I tell about it. And for me, the choice of story I can tell is a lot more constrained than simply picking what would make me feel good. I have a strong aversion to believing the comforting story.</strong> <strong><a href=""https://putanumonit.com/2018/04/23/dont-believe-wrong-things/"">I don&#x2019;t want to believe wrong things</a>.</strong></p><p>I think you&#x2019;re right in that it comes from a deeper crux. When I&#x2019;m imagining what you&#x2019;re believing, there&#x2019;s a wrong concept that&#x2019;s functioning in a way that it doesn&#x2019;t in my own mind.</p><p><strong>This comes back to assuming an external reality, which is the big rift between</strong> <strong><a href=""https://knowingless.com/2016/11/01/the-useless-idea-of-truth/"">what you believe</a></strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/XqvnWFtRD2keJdwjX/the-useful-idea-of-truth"">&#x201C;standard&#x201D; Rationality</a>.</strong></p><p>Yes, that&#x2019;s true.</p><p><strong>So one of the reasons why you reject the idea of an external reality that our narratives have to be measured against is that in your mind there&#x2019;s only logical consistency and subjective experience, nothing else. There&#x2019;s nothing else you can be sure of. Alright. If I told myself a false story about my leg it would affect my experience and run into logical inconsistencies.</strong></p><p>Can you say that again <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/WBdvyyHLdxZSAMmoz/taboo-your-words"">without using the word</a> &#x201C;false&#x201D;? Does that work at all?</p><p><strong>Let&#x2019;s come up with a hypothetical story I can tell myself, like maybe with a broken leg I&#x2019;ll stop focusing so much on soccer and instead finally sit down to write that book, which is what I really wanted to be doing but was distracted.&#xA0;</strong></p><p><strong>Already, I&#x2019;m forced to fill in questionable details like assuming I don&#x2019;t write a book because I play soccer too much and not because of laziness or insecurity about my talent as a writer. So I predict that now with a broken leg I&#x2019;ll finally sit down and write but I won&#x2019;t, which is how I would know that the story I told myself wasn&#x2019;t true.</strong></p><p>Right, you&#x2019;re worried about making up a story that ends up in false predictions. And if you engage in that story, then the world is going to be out of your control and things will go wrong or you will end up disappointed.</p><p><strong>And the problem with false stories is that they propagate and accumulate like debt. I&#x2019;ll have to make up more and more supporting details to keep the story from crashing.</strong></p><p>I&#x2019;m with you on this. For me, I classify this as a lack of curiosity. I have a way that I want things to go, and I&#x2019;m not curious about the ways in which they might not go. And then I develop a reality that&#x2019;s immune to other things, and my awareness is not big enough to encompass things that might contradict what I believe. But I still think that this isn&#x2019;t what I&#x2019;m trying to get at, which is very likely my fault. I am having a hard time articulating exactly what I mean by &#x201C;the magic of meaning creation&#x201D;.</p><p>I find that meaning creation usually works better in hindsight. In hindsight, I have become grateful for negative things because I can see the good that they gave me, that I wouldn&#x2019;t have had otherwise. Perhaps I would have had other good things, but that&#x2019;s not really the point. The point is that I&#x2019;m constructing this narrative arc of myself, a journey. And I feel very aware that it is a story, but I&#x2019;m not subject to the story. I don&#x2019;t believe the story is an indicator of reality. I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s predictive. I just have the flexibility, the ability to inhabit that story.</p><p>It feels extremely healthy to me. It puts things in their place.</p><p><strong>Here&#x2019;s what it comes down to for me. I drank alcohol before with no lingering effects, so I can drink this whiskey without worrying about</strong> <strong>becoming an alcoholic. But I&#x2019;m pretty sure that I&#x2019;m already &#x201C;wearing&#x201D; many fake stories that I&#x2019;ve forgotten or never realized are fake. And epistemic rationality is so hard, I don&#x2019;t want to burden it with one more made-up story if I don&#x2019;t have to.</strong></p><p>What are you worried about experiencing? What are you afraid will happen to you if you do the wrong thing with your stories?</p><p><strong>I&#x2019;m worried that I may come to</strong> <strong>a serious test vis-a-vis reality. A big decision with life-or-death stakes that will require a very careful and precise understanding of reality, or overcoming a lot of misleading intuitions. Perhaps even something like deciding about cryonics. And it won&#x2019;t be graded on a curve, it may take just about all the rationality I could muster. And if I sacrifice any epistemic rationality I will surely fail.</strong></p><p><strong>In my life right now I don&#x2019;t experience too much negative emotion. I don&#x2019;t need to sacrifice epistemic rationality for comfort because my life is comfortable enough.</strong> <strong>And sacrificing epistemic rationality is a slippery slope, like</strong> <strong><a href=""https://putanumonit.com/2018/04/23/dont-believe-wrong-things/#jesus"">The Legend of Murder-Gandhi</a>. Especially when I share the made-up story with people around me and now they end up reinforcing it even if I want in the future to take the mask off.</strong></p><p>I&#x2019;m trying to ask about some specific example which is why I phrased my question the way that I did. I feel like my curiosity hasn&#x2019;t been scratched yet. What concrete experience are you afraid of? The experience of regret at having made the wrong decision? The experience of feeling like a failure, like you weren&#x2019;t good enough? Feeling inadequate and out of control?</p><p><strong>No, the actual experiences, the consequences of making the wrong decision. Dying when I could&#x2019;ve lived forever.</strong></p><p>You can&#x2019;t experience death, but you&#x2019;re right. So let&#x2019;s say being tortured by the paperclip god, for example.</p><p><strong>You&#x2019;re right, dying is not that bad. But the living is pretty great.</strong></p><p>Yeah. Living is pretty great.</p><p><strong><a href=""https://putanumonit.com/2017/03/12/goddess-spreadsheet/"">I wrote about an example of summoning rationality</a></strong> <strong>to make a key decision where I ultimately ended up overruling both my intuition and common wisdom. And this decision gave me my marriage, which is so precious to me. And I&#x2019;m pretty sure I would have gotten that decision wrong if I didn&#x2019;t have that ability of explicit rational decision making or if I didn&#x2019;t have the confidence in that ability. It&#x2019;s as close to a superpower as I have, and I think it&#x2019;s really fragile.</strong></p><p><strong>Let&#x2019;s say I had been dumped by some girl many years ago and I was heartbroken. So I weave a comforting story about how it was actually good that she dumped me, and that story entails beliefs about what sorts of women I have good and bad relationships with. And then when I would have to make a decision about whom to date it would be impossible to stop believing that story, it&#x2019;s already part of me. Brains don&#x2019;t work in a way where you can cleanly take stories off your mind like pulling a mask off your face.</strong></p><p><strong>When I read The Sequences for the first time I didn&#x2019;t really get why Eliezer was talking about</strong> <strong><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/SGR4GxFK7KmW7ckCB/something-to-protect"">having some greater purpose</a></strong> <strong>behind rationality, it just seemed that epistemic rationality was clearly good in itself. But now I get that there are so many temptations to give up bits and pieces of it. Eliezer believes that perhaps he alone can save humanity from extinction, and even if that&#x2019;s crazy you need a belief like that to always choose rationality over comfort.</strong></p><p><strong>And maybe this distinction between epistemic rationality and comforting falsehoods is wrong and confused, but I don&#x2019;t have a desire to poke at it.</strong></p><p>I don&#x2019;t feel that my rationalist skill or ability to reason in very much the way that you talked about, like evaluating choices and recognizing biases, has been impacted negatively whatsoever by psychedelics or by the other thing which is meaning-making and the world being not real. It feels like I&#x2019;m talking about two separate classes of things, and the way in which they&#x2019;re separate makes it very difficult to point at one using the other. I want to be very clear that I am 100 percent on board with everything that you said. Epistemic rationality is extremely fun and really useful and very valuable. And I cling to it. I get made fun of by my friends for the degree to which I am concerned with &#x201D;finding the truth of the situation&#x201D;.</p><p><strong>Maybe I&#x2019;m just more paranoid. I feel like my internal feeling of how good I am at epistemic rationality is a piss poor measure of how good I am at it. If I can&#x2019;t trust my intuitions about one thing, it&#x2019;s &#x201C;how good I am at not trusting my intuition&#x201D;.</strong></p><p>I think I understand what you mean, though. If the thing that you&#x2019;re battling is the brain, it&#x2019;s capable of being incredibly misleading.&#xA0;</p><p>I definitely recognize this in myself, how the way that I approach the world is so different. You go on one good date you fall for someone like crazy or have one fight with your partner and you want to leave them forever, but then the next day you feel completely different. I mean, I&#x2019;m just generally agreeing with you about how non-trustworthy the brain is if your goal is epistemics.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Going back to your writing about trauma, I wanted to ask you about free will. You mentioned</strong> <strong><em><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4069.Man_s_Search_for_Meaning"">Man&#x2019;s Search for Meaning</a></em>, an exceptional book. The book endorses free will not as a metaphysical claim but as an attitude &#x2014; you don&#x2019;t choose what happens to you, but you choose how you react to it. And this seems to contradict what you often write about, that everything could only have unfolded the way they did and no other way, including your own actions.</strong></p><p>Well, this whole thing is about contradictory clothes to wear. I have no issue with contradiction here.</p><p>When I talk about trying to imagine what it would be like to not be <em>interpreting being</em> when I was younger and imagining everything going to static, you could say I can&#x2019;t <em>actually</em> imagine not being an interpreting being. But there&#x2019;s something about the dissolution of meaning-making into a nothingness state that I think is analogous to freewill. When I dissolve the meaning-making thing, there is no free will or there is all of it. Basically, the division between myself and others goes away.&#xA0;</p><p>You can build a story where the sense of agency you have signifies a division between self and other. This is what gives <em>me</em> my sense of identity and personal consciousness as opposed to <em>you</em>, because I&#x2019;m in control of this and you&#x2019;re in control of that. That&#x2019;s also a fun, meaning-making story that we can engage in. But I enjoy recognizing that that is a story, and that we can take that story off or on as we see fit, or to watch that story come upon us or away from us. This happens, too, because free will is an illusion.</p><p><strong>I guess my support for adopting free will as a stance is also a dress I wear, one that contradicts my belief in external, deterministic reality.</strong></p><p><strong>Let&#x2019;s talk about acid.</strong></p><p><strong>A lot of your writing about your experiences on LSD is like an attempt to put into words or build a model out of something that you know to be true as an immediate experience. I guess I could call this inside-out thinking, as opposed to what is often done in rationality where you try to figure out a cognitive &#x201C;system 2&#x201D; model of how things are and then aligning your intuitions and your interpretation of experience with this &#x201C;outside&#x201D; model. Does this make sense as a distinction?</strong></p><p>This is kind of a tricky question. For me, it doesn&#x2019;t feel like that dichotomy is a useful frame. Is the question that we&#x2019;re asking how do these two things relate to each other?&#xA0;</p><p><strong>There are more cognitive models, things you can write in a blog post or draw a diagram of, and there are things that just feel intuitively true or true in your immediate, wordless experience. So if we desire to align them, it seems one could do that from the inside out or from the outside in.</strong></p><p>So when you said &#x201C;things that feel wordlessly true&#x201D; I&#x2019;m matching this onto a thing. Let&#x2019;s say, I take acid, and then I realized something new about the universe. One such realization for me for a while was that all internally consistent realities must necessarily exist. It&#x2019;s a fact that feels intuitively true that I have landed on.&#xA0;</p><p>You can compare this to cognitive processing, like working something out on paper. But I think at the fundamental level, the sense of insight that results from both of these, is the same thing. This sense of intuitive truth is exactly like the building blocks that make up the cognitive models that we write about in blog posts. There are differences, but at the core level, they&#x2019;re not really different things.</p><p>Some people ask how I know I&#x2019;m not going to take acid and be convinced of some other reality. That I&#x2019;m not going to have this sense of deep, incredible insight and learning but I&#x2019;m just going crazy and being misled. But the sense of insight that you have when you&#x2019;re learning things in school is the exact same thing that you have on acid. You can&#x2019;t be misled about the sense of having an insight. You can, however, develop a system that is surprised.</p><p><strong>You mentioned that you haven&#x2019;t really read a lot about meditative traditions besides the Tao Te Ching, to compare them to your experience with LSD.&#xA0;</strong></p><p>I&#x2019;ve read some of <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4129848-mastering-the-core-teachings-of-the-buddha"">Daniel Ingram&#x2019;s book</a> but that&#x2019;s been about it. The Tao Te Ching resonates very strongly. That whole book is like putting me in a little tin can and shaking it. It&#x2019;s good.</p><p><strong>I got really curious about Buddhism and nirvana. So</strong> <strong><a href=""https://putanumonit.com/2018/11/27/peanut-butter/"">I talked to my Buddhist friends</a>, I talked to monks in Thailand,</strong> <strong><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34962306-meditation-for-fidgety-skeptics"">I read the books</a></strong> <strong>by</strong> <strong><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18774981-waking-up"">both Harrises</a>, and it didn&#x2019;t completely make sense. But when I read your description of what it was like after</strong> <strong><a href=""https://knowingless.com/2016/08/21/421/"">taking LSD weekly for 10 months</a>, not having desires, thinking calmly about how you may starve on the streets, that sounded like a state that could be nirvana.</strong> </p><p><strong>When you hear about various religious traditions and concepts, do any of them make sense? Do other people&#x2019;s experiences and frameworks for making sense of them resonate with yours?</strong></p><p>As you mentioned, I&#x2019;m not very educated on spiritual meditative tradition, so I can&#x2019;t really speak to them. I don&#x2019;t know if the thing that I went through is what other people would consider nirvana at all. I don&#x2019;t know if nirvana makes sense.</p><p>My experience has resonance with being religious, like becoming religious again. It&#x2019;s similar to the feeling that I used to get when I was worshiping God as a Christian. I would take acid and think that that&#x2019;s what people in my childhood were trying to get at and using the religion to do it.&#xA0;</p><p>I know this is an oversimplification, but this is my conspiracy theory as to why meditators think that like psychedelics aren&#x2019;t going to get you anywhere.</p><p><strong>Sunk cost?</strong></p><p>Yeah, because if meditation can&#x2019;t get you anywhere acid can&#x2019;t, they&#x2019;ve been spending many hours of their lives inefficiently.</p><p>I mean, it&#x2019;s probably not true, but I like to think about it.</p><p><strong>It&#x2019;s interesting to hear people like Sam Harris, who is an experienced meditator and also an experienced psychonaut, talk about this. He admits that drugs can be a shortcut but he has to caveat it with reasons why meditation is actually great. And he also has a meditation app that brings him money so he can&#x2019;t tell people to just drop acid.</strong></p><p><strong>Let&#x2019;s finish up by talking about the void.</strong></p><p><strong>Do you have people reaching out to you after</strong> <strong><a href=""https://knowingless.com/2019/08/17/you-will-forget/"">they read your post</a></strong> <strong>telling you they&#x2019;ve seen the void?</strong></p><p>A lot of people say that they understand me but this feels different than the category of people for whom I have a sense that they understand it. I guess I&#x2019;m kind of skeptical about these claims. I want to be clear that I&#x2019;m not making judgments about anybody, it&#x2019;s just the way that I react to people.&#xA0;</p><p>So sometimes people will say they understand it in such a way that it generates this sensation inside of me, which is like the experience coming back very strongly. And I feel like the person describing it is inhabiting that experience as well. It feels like I&#x2019;m on drugs, thoughts stop operating in the same way and it becomes very hard to talk. That happens very rarely. I have a lot of people telling me that they understand it, but people saying in such a way that it generates the experience inside me is very rare.</p><p><strong>It&#x2019;s very interesting that it happens. It doesn&#x2019;t necessarily have to be that what triggers this response is somebody else describing the same experience, right? The lock is not the key.</strong> </p><p>Right, that&#x2019;s true.</p><p><strong>You described your acid journey as a process of losing the things that make up your character, beliefs and desires and insecurities. And then closing your eyes to the void and coming back to them. Did you come back to a different person than who you were with different desires and values?</strong></p><p>Yes. I feel there are two ways you might be asking this question, or at least, two ways I&#x2019;m going to interpret it.&#xA0;</p><p>One of them is: is my experience of reality permanently shifted because the thing that I went through is still with me on an ongoing basis? The answer is yes. Another question is: do I have personality traits that are altered? Do I score differently in personality tests? Do I have different habits? And the answer there is also yes, but maybe less than you think.</p><p>So the journey in cleared out a lot of baggage I had. It fixed a huge amount of the insecurity that I had, even though I still have some now. And I don&#x2019;t suffer from trauma anymore, which I used to. Those are the two largest measurable differences. There are a whole bunch of smaller ones, most of them are just about being at ease and the way that being at ease manifests in the world.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Were any of those changes intentional?</strong></p><p>No, they just happen.</p><p><strong>Do you think there is any hope of doing this exercise with an intention to change? Letting go of some things I&#x2019;m attached to like caring about shiny clothes and starting to care more about animal rights, say. Acid as a tool for</strong> <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37702276-aspiration"">aspiration</a>.</p><p>I don&#x2019;t think acid works quite like that. The part of you that wants something different from what you are right now is a concrete aspect of yourself. And acid will affect everything, both your current desires and the meta part of you that desires to change your desires. They&#x2019;re both in the same category, you can&#x2019;t just preserve one desire and change the other.&#xA0;</p><p>When I say that I came out of this with less trauma and more confidence, it&#x2019;s not because I was trying to be less traumatized or confident but because I was trying to observe what was there. And then the side effect of observation were these results in that arrived in ways I could never have expected and would never have happened if I was actively trying to get there.</p><p>A big part of this is surrendering control. You can&#x2019;t achieve certain types of development while still being in control, still being the person who wants to achieve that development. You have to let go of the part of yourself that is trying to do the steering.&#xA0;</p><p>You know, it&#x2019;s really fucking terrifying. I totally understand that people don&#x2019;t want to let go of the thing doing the steering because it&#x2019;s the most intense and terrifying thing you can do. But that&#x2019;s how you do it.</p><p><strong>So why did those specific changes happen and not other ones? Did it have to do with things in your subconscious? Your circumstances?&#xA0;</strong></p><p>I think that what changed were aspects of myself that were caused by not being self-aware. So the increased self-awareness naturally changed the parts of me that were a defense against knowing who I was. The trauma thing, for example, was me holding onto the story that I had been wronged. I had this sense of identity and I didn&#x2019;t want to become aware that I was holding onto that sense of my identity.&#xA0;</p><p>But acid made me aware that I was doing that, and when I was aware of it it just naturally faded away. So those things that were caused by lack of awareness changed and those that weren&#x2019;t, didn&#x2019;t. Does that make sense?&#xA0;</p><p>Sometimes it&#x2019;s hard to tell if I&#x2019;m being coherent when I talk. Sometimes when I&#x2019;m talking, I&#x2019;m like, am I just saying words right now? I&#x2019;ve no idea.</p>",Jacobian,jacob-falkovich,Jacob Falkovich,

<p>I along with several AI Impacts researchers recently talked to talked to Rohin Shah about why he is relatively optimistic about AI systems being developed safely. Rohin Shah is a 5th year PhD student at the <a href=""https://humancompatible.ai/"">Center for Human-Compatible AI</a> (CHAI) at Berkeley, and a prominent member of the Effective Altruism community.</p>


<p>Rohin reported an unusually large (90%) chance that AI systems will be safe without additional intervention. His optimism was largely based on his belief that AI development will be relatively gradual and AI researchers will correct safety issues that come up.</p>



<p>He reported two other beliefs that I found unusual: He thinks that as AI systems get more powerful, they will actually become <em>more</em> interpretable because they will use features that humans also tend to use. He also said that intuitions from AI/ML make him skeptical of claims that evolution baked a lot into the human brain, and he thinks there’s a ~50% chance that we will get AGI within two decades via a broad training process that mimics the way human babies learn.</p>

<blockquote><p>“As I grew older, I understood that instructions came with this voice. What were these instructions? The instructions were never to lament casually. And if one is to express the great inevitable defeat that awaits us all, it must be done within the strict confines of dignity and beauty.”</p></blockquote>
<p>This is apparently exactly the opposite of how most people in the American world feel at this time of year. The great inevitable defeat should be expressed with electronically jeering plastic skeletons, humorous fake corpses, faux-threatening gravestones, and—let’s not forget the violence and disease responsible for so many deaths—generous fake blood, vomit, and slime. The celebration should be not only frivolous and ugly to the max, but really go hard on minimizing dignity! Don’t just dress as a fun ugly corpse, make it a sexually depraved fun ugly corpse!</p>
<p>Isn’t this just a bit weird? For instance, how is this good? </p>
<p>I’ve heard a couple of times something like: “Halloween is nice because it is rebellious, and a relief from all that seriousness. People usually treat these things with sacredness and somberness, and it’s a lot to deal with.”</p>
<p>If that’s what it is, would it also be cool if we incorporated more second-rate stand up comedy routines and pranks into funerals? Or had more fun smallpox themed parties?</p>
<p>I don’t think people do actually contend with death or horror in a more comfortable way via Halloween, for the most part. My guess is that they basically don’t think about the content of what they are doing, and just get used to hunting for bargain plastic corpse babies to put on their lawns, and laughing with each other about how realistic and gruesome they are. Which seems more like desensitization than coming to terms with a thing. Which I doubt is a good kind of relief from seriousness. </p>
<p>Also, if we are going to have a change of mood break around the potential horrors of life, the alternate feelings and purposes Halloween suggests just don’t seem very good. ‘Trick or treat?’ Cheap malice or cheap hedonism? Quick, find a huge mound of junk food, I forgot because I’m very competitive about drunkenly parading my buttocks in a way that makes me seem clever..</p>
<p>I’m obviously missing something, and I don’t actually blame anyone much within reason for getting into the holidays of their culture, but come on culture, what is this?</p>",KatjaGrace,katjagrace,KatjaGrace,

The post uses <u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08663"">Causal Influence Diagrams</a></u> (<u><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/2abdf19aa813/an-61ai-policy-and-governance-from-two-people-in-the-field"">AN #61</a></u>) to analyze the problem in a simple grid world where an agent can easily change the definition of its reward. The proposed solution is <strong>current-RF optimization</strong>: Instead of maximizing the sum of rewards that would be given after each action (where the reward signal can dynamically change over time), the agent searches for and executes a plan of actions that would maximize the current, unchanged reward signal. The agent would then not be incentivized to tamper with the reward function since the current reward is not maximized by such tampering. There are two different flavours to this: time-inconsistency-aware agents account for future changes in their own behaviour due to modified reward signals, while TI-unaware agents ignore this in their planning. TI-aware agents have an incentive to preserve their reward signal and are therefore potentially incorrigible.</p><p><strong>Flo&apos;s opinion:</strong> I enjoyed this application of causal diagrams and think that similar detailed analyses of the interactions between failure modes like wireheading, instrumental goals like reward preservation and the specific implementation of an agent would be quite valuable. That said, I am less excited about the feasibility of the proposed solution since it seems to require detailed knowledge of the agent about counterfactual rewards. Also, I expect the distinction between changes in the reward signal and changes in the state that happen to also affect the reward to be very fuzzy in real problems and current-RF optimization seems to require a very sharp boundary.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> I agree with Flo&apos;s opinion above, and I think the example in the blog post shows how the concept &quot;what affects the reward&quot; is fuzzy: in their gridworld inspired by the game Baba Is You, they say that moving the word &quot;Reward&quot; down to make rocks rewarding is &quot;tampering&quot;, whereas I would have called that a perfectly legitimate way to play given my knowledge of Baba Is You.</p><p><strong>Read more:</strong> <u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.04734"">Paper: Reward Tampering Problems and Solutions in Reinforcement Learning: A Causal Influence Diagram Perspective</a></u></p><h1><strong>Technical AI alignment</strong></h1><h3><strong>Problems</strong></h3><p><u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/EpdXLNXyL4EYLFwF8/an-increasingly-manipulative-newsfeed"">An Increasingly Manipulative Newsfeed</a></u> <em>(Micha&#xEB;l Trazzi and Stuart Armstrong)</em> (summarized by Matthew): An early argument for specialized AI safety work is that misaligned systems will be incentivized to lie about their intentions while weak, so that they aren&apos;t modified. Then, when the misaligned AIs are safe from modification, they will become dangerous. Ben Goertzel <u><a href=""https://jetpress.org/v26.1/goertzel.pdf"">found the argument unlikely</a></u>, pointing out that weak systems won&apos;t be good at deception. This post asserts that weak systems can still be manipulative, and gives a concrete example. The argument is based on a machine learning system trained to maximize the number of articles that users label &quot;unbiased&quot; in their newsfeed. One way it can start being deceptive is by seeding users with a few very biased articles. Pursuing this strategy may cause users to label everything else unbiased, as it has altered their reference for evaluation. The system is therefore incentivized to be dishonest without necessarily being capable of pure deception.</p><p><strong>Matthew&apos;s opinion:</strong> While I appreciate and agree with the thesis of this post -- that machine learning models don&apos;t have to be extremely competent to be manipulative -- I would still prefer a different example to convince skeptical researchers. I suspect many people would reply that we could easily patch the issue without doing dedicated safety work. In particular, it is difficult to see how this strategy arises if we train the system via supervised learning rather than training it to maximize the number of articles users label unbiased (which requires RL).</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> I certainly agree with this post that ML models don&apos;t need to be competent to be manipulative. However, it&apos;s notable that this happened via the model randomly manipulating people (during exploration) and noticing that it helps it achieve its objective. It seems likely that to cause <em>human extinction</em> via a treacherous turn, the model would need to do zero-shot manipulation. This seems much less likely to happen (though I wouldn&apos;t say it&apos;s impossible).</p><h3><strong>Mesa optimization</strong></h3><p><u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/fM5ZWGDbnjb7ThNKJ/are-minimal-circuits-deceptive"">Are minimal circuits deceptive?</a></u> <em>(Evan Hubinger)</em> (summarized by Rohin): While it <u><a href=""https://ordinaryideas.wordpress.com/2016/11/30/what-does-the-universal-prior-actually-look-like/"">has been argued</a></u> that the <em>simplest</em> program that solves a complex task is likely to be deceptive, it <u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/nyCHnY7T5PHPLjxmN/open-question-are-minimal-circuits-daemon-free"">hasn&apos;t yet been argued</a></u> whether the <em>fastest</em> program that solves a complex task will be deceptive. This post argues that fast programs will often be forced to <em>learn</em> a good policy (just as we need to do today), and the learned policy is likely to be deceptive (presumably due to <u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01820"">risks from learned optimization</a></u> (<u><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/92b3a9458c2d/an-58-mesa-optimization-what-it-is-and-why-we-should-care"">AN #58</a></u>)). Thus, there are at least some tasks where the fastest program will also be deceptive.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> This is an intriguing hypothesis, but I&apos;m not yet convinced: it&apos;s not clear why the fastest program would have to <em>learn</em> the best policy, rather than directly hardcoding the best policy. If there are multiple possible tasks, the program could have a nested if structure that figures out which task needs to be done and then executes the best policy for that task. More details in <u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/fM5ZWGDbnjb7ThNKJ/are-minimal-circuits-deceptive#f93Wa4nqRAiRuXpS6"">this comment</a></u>.</p><p><u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/jGB7Pd5q8ivBor8Ee/impact-measurement-and-value-neutrality-verification-1"">Impact measurement and value-neutrality verification</a></u> <em>(Evan Hubinger)</em> (summarized by Rohin): So far, most <u><a href=""https://alignmentforum.org/posts/wJK944YqvFwjdbqCP/four-ways-an-impact-measure-could-help-alignment"">uses of impact formalizations</a></u> (<u><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/0b74c28413c0/an-64-using-deep-rl-and-reward-uncertainty-to-incentivize-preference-learning"">AN #64</a></u>) don&apos;t help with inner alignment, because we simply add impact to the (outer) loss function. This post suggests that impact formalizations could also be adapted to verify whether an optimization algorithm is <em>value-neutral</em> -- that is, no matter what objective you apply it towards, it provides approximately the same benefit. In particular, <u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/yEa7kwoMpsBgaBCgb/towards-a-new-impact-measure"">AUP</a></u> (<u><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/0c5eeec28f75/alignment-newsletter-25"">AN #25</a></u>) measures the <em>expectation</em> of the distribution of changes in attainable utilities for a given action. You could get a measure of the value-neutrality of an action by instead computing the <em>standard deviation</em> of this distribution, since that measures how different the changes in utility are. (Evan would use policies instead of actions, but conceptually that&apos;s a minor difference.) Verifying value-neutrality could be used to ensure that the <u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/nRAMpjnb6Z4Qv3imF/the-strategy-stealing-assumption"">strategy-stealing assumption</a></u> (<u><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/3d4e6c2c206f/an-65learning-useful-skills-by-watching-humans-play"">AN #65</a></u>) is true.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> I continue to be confused about the purpose of the strategy-stealing assumption, so I don&apos;t have a strong opinion about the importance of value-neutrality verification. I do think that the distribution of changes to attainable utilities is a powerful mathematical object, and it makes sense that there are other properties of interest that involve analyzing it.</p><p><u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/uXH4r6MmKPedk8rMA/gradient-hacking"">Gradient hacking</a></u> <em>(Evan Hubinger)</em> (summarized by Rohin): This post calls attention to the problem of <strong>gradient hacking</strong>, where a powerful agent being trained by gradient descent could structure its computation in such a way that it causes its gradients to update it in some particular way. For example, a mesa optimizer could structure its computation to first check whether its objective has been tampered with, and if so to fail catastrophically, so that the gradients tend to point away from tampering with the objective.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> I&apos;d be interested in work that further sketches out a scenario in which this could occur. I wrote about some particular details in <u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/uXH4r6MmKPedk8rMA/gradient-hacking#c7R2dBHRsCAnXyk7b"">this comment</a></u>.</p><h3><strong>Learning human intent</strong></h3><p><u><a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.09906"">Leveraging Human Guidance for Deep Reinforcement Learning Tasks</a></u> <em>(Ruohan Zhang et al)</em> (summarized by Nicholas): A core problem in RL is the communication of our goals and prior knowledge to an agent. One common approach to this is imitation learning: the human provides example demonstrations of a task, and the agent learns to mimic them. However, there are some limitations to this approach, such as requiring the human to be capable of the task. This paper outlines five different modalities from which agents can learn: evaluations, preferences, hierarchical feedback, observations, and attention (for example, where humans are looking while solving a task). It then suggests future research directions.</p><p>For this summary, I will focus on the future research directions, but you can read the full paper to understand existing approaches. The first issue is that datasets of human guidance are difficult to capture and depend on many specific factors of the individuals providing guidance. As a result, the paper suggests creating standard datasets to save effort and enable fair comparisons. The second direction is to better understand how humans should teach agents. The literature currently emphasizes progress in learning methods, but improved teaching methods may be just as valuable when learning from human guidance. The last is unifying learning across different input modalities; ideally an agent would be able to learn from many different types of human guidance over different phases of its learning.</p><p><strong>Nicholas&apos;s opinion:</strong> I think the problem of providing human guidance to agents is a core problem in alignment, and I am glad to see more discussion of that problem. I generally think that this type of broad overview is very valuable for communicating research to those who just want a broad overview of the field and don&#x2019;t need to know the individual details of each paper. However, I would appreciate if there were more quantitative comparisons of the tradeoffs between different paradigms. The introduction mentions sample efficiency and the large effort required for human labelling, which made me hope for theoretical or empirical comparisons of the different methods with regards to sample efficiency and labelling effort. Since this was lacking, it also left me unclear on what motivated their suggested research directions. Personally, I would be much more excited to pursue a research direction if there were quantitative results showing particular failure modes or negative characteristics of current approaches that motivated that particular approach.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> This seems like a great survey paper and I like their proposed future directions, especially on learning from different kinds of human guidance, and on improving methods of teaching. While it does seem useful to have datasets of human guidance in order to compare algorithms, this prevents researchers from making improvements by figuring out new forms of guidance not present in the dataset. As a result, I&apos;d be more excited about benchmarks that are evaluated by how much time it takes for Mechanical Turkers to train an agent to complete the task. Admittedly, it would be costlier in both time and money for researchers to do such an evaluation.</p><h3><strong>Miscellaneous (Alignment)</strong></h3><p><u><a href=""https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/10/26/20932289/ai-stuart-russell-human-compatible"">Vox interview with Stuart Russell</a></u> <em>(Kelsey Piper)</em> (summarized by Rohin): Kelsey talked with Stuart Russell about his new book, <u><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Human-Compatible-Artificial-Intelligence-Problem-ebook/dp/B07N5J5FTS"">Human Compatible</a></u> (<u><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/59ddebcb3b9a/an-69-stuart-russells-new-book-on-why-we-need-to-replace-the-standard-model-of-ai"">AN #69</a></u>).</p><h1><strong>Other progress in AI</strong></h1><h3><strong>Meta learning</strong></h3><p><u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.04630"">Meta-Learning with Implicit Gradients</a></u> <em>(Aravind Rajeswaran et al)</em> (summarized by Nicholas): The field of meta-learning endeavors to create agents that don&#x2019;t just learn, but instead learn how to learn. Concretely, the goal is to train an algorithm on a subset of tasks, such that it can get low error on a different subset of tasks with minimal training.</p><p>Model Agnostic Meta Learning (MAML) tackles this problem by finding a set of initial parameters, &#x3B8;, from which it is easy to quickly learn other tasks. During training, an inner loop copies &#x3B8; into parameters &#x3C6;, and optimizes &#x3C6; for a fixed number of steps. Then an outer loop computes the gradient of &#x3B8; through the inner optimization process (e.g. backpropagating through gradient descent) and updates &#x3B8; accordingly.</p><p>MAML as described above has a few downsides, which this paper addresses.</p><p>1. The base optimizer itself must be differentiable, not just the loss function.</p><p>2. The gradient computation requires linear compute and memory in the number of steps, and suffers from vanishing and exploding gradients as that number increases.</p><p>3. In the inner loop, while &#x3C6; is initially identical to &#x3B8;, its dependence on &#x3B8; fades as more steps occur.</p><br><br><p>Implicit MAML (iMAML) addresses these with two innovations. First, it adds a regularization term to keep &#x3C6; close to &#x3B8;, which maintains the dependence of &#x3C6; on &#x3B8; throughout training. Second, it computes the outer update gradient in closed form based purely on the final value of &#x3C6; rather than using the entire optimization trajectory. Because the inner loop is an optimization process, the end result is an optimum, and thus has zero gradient. This leads to an implicit equation that when differentiated gives a closed form representation for the gradient of &#x3B8;. This enables iMAML to work with inner optimization sequences that have more training steps, or that are not differentiable.</p><p><strong>Nicholas&apos;s opinion:</strong> I am not an expert in meta-learning, but my impression is that this paper removes a major bottleneck to future research on meta-learning and gives a clear direction for future work on medium-shot learning and more complex inner optimizers. I&#x2019;m also particularly interested in how this will interact with <u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01820"">risks from learned optimization</a></u> (<u><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/92b3a9458c2d/an-58-mesa-optimization-what-it-is-and-why-we-should-care"">AN #58</a></u>). In particular, it seems possible to me that the outer parameters &#x3B8; or a subset of them might potentially encode an internal mesa-optimizer. On the other hand, they may simply be learning locations in the parameter space from which it is easy to reach useful configurations. Interpretability of weights is a difficult problem, but I&apos;d be excited about any work that sheds light on what characteristics of &#x3B8; enable it to generalize across tasks.</p>",rohinmshah,rohinmshah,Rohin Shah,

For those who don’t follow the sport New Zealand (the All Blacks) are comfortably the best team in the world. They have been top of the world rankings since 2009. They win 92% of their matches. With a population of 4.8m, it’s fair to say that New Zealand’s <a href=""https://putanumonit.com/2015/11/10/003-soccer1/"">national rugby affiliation</a> must be off the charts. </p><p>At half time England were 15-10 up. An interesting statistic was rolled out. Since their World Cup win in 2011 they have only lost 4 out of 20 of the matches in which they were behind at half time. At the end of the match the All Blacks had turned it around again, winning 16-15, making it 4/21 losses.</p><p>This sounds very impressive but I wondered how much of this effect could be put down to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_toward_the_mean"">regression towards the mean</a>. After all, a team that wins 92% of their matches might well be good enough to win 81% of matches when they are losing at half time without postulating an extra performance boost in such circumstances.</p><p>I thought it would be fun to investigate.</p><h1>Method</h1><p>I gathered all of their results and corresponding half time scores since the 2011 World Cup. I only included data from teams who could realistically win a half against the All Blacks in order not to bias the results with high scores against weaker teams. I included Argentina, Australia, England, France, Ireland, Scotland, South Africa and Wales. This gave 85 results.</p><p>If anything, this will be biased towards having more wins when losing at half time. Losing at half time would imply that the opposition is more likely to be towards the top end of performance. However the predicted second half performance is based on all matches involving the relevant teams. So the calculation isn’t perfect but I couldn’t think of a better way to do it without reducing my dataset which would reduce experimental power.</p><p>The dataset isn’t big enough to allow for lowering my p-value threshold much by multiple hypothesis testing. I have two formal p-values:</p><p>    Do New Zealand generally perform better in the second half than the first?</p><p>    Do New Zealand perform better than normal in the second half when they are losing at half time?</p><p>I’m looking for p&lt;0.025 for these 2. I calculate other p-values they are labelled as exploratory.</p><h1>Results</h1><h2>First half vs second half</h2><p>Analysing first half vs second half in all games, the mean and standard error of the All Blacks’ points difference over the opposition were:</p><p>First half:                 <span><style>.mjx-chtml {display: inline-block; line-height: 0; text-indent: 0; text-align: left; text-transform: none; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 100%; font-size-adjust: none; letter-spacing: normal; word-wrap: normal; word-spacing: normal; white-space: nowrap; float: none; direction: ltr; max-width: none; max-height: none; min-width: 0; min-height: 0; border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 1px 0}

This matches the commonly held impression that the All Blacks’ fitness is better than most teams so they can outperform them in the second half. This is important for future calculations.</p><p>With those first half numbers and a normal distribution, we would expect the All Blacks to lose 28% of their first halves – i.e. 23.6/85. The fact that they have only lost 21 is slightly better than this but not significantly (p=0.082, exploratory).</p><h2>Improved performance when losing at half time</h2><p>Combining the actual data for the amount that they were down at half time in those 21 matches with a normal distribution for their average performance in the 2nd half would predict 7.4/21 losses. Their actual performance (4 losses) is better than this but not significantly (p=0.068).</p><p>Certainly regression towards the mean explains a big fraction of the extra comebacks. </p><p>Naively it seems like you should make a comeback in fewer than half the matches that you are losing at half time. Even if we optimistically say 10/21 comebacks are expected then we can explain away 3.6 additional comebacks by appealing to RttM and there are only 3.4 comebacks left to be explained by improved performance.</p><p>However those 3.4 extra comebacks are still quite impressive - the All Blacks lost 46% fewer games when behind at half time than you would expect even accounting for RttM - but the sample size is too small for it to confidently imply an actual improved performance.</p><h2>Overall performance</h2><p>If I combine the normal distributions from the two halves I get a predicted win rate of 83% - not as good as the 92% achieved. This is significant (p=0.016) but I'm not counting it as it was exploratory. </p><h2>Further exploration</h2><p>So the All Blacks’ performance in second halves where they were losing at half time is better than their average but there is insufficient data to conclude that this is not just coincidence.</p><p>I put together a graph showing the points difference between the All Blacks and their opponents to investigate. </p><span><figure><img src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/deszvp5h9/image/upload/v1543009526/blog%20posts/New_Zealand.png"" class=""draft-image "" style=""width:94%""></figure></span><p>What stands out is the large spike in games which the All Blacks finished with a points advantage of 0-4 after having lost the first half. Of the 21 lost first halves, the All Blacks drew/won the match by a small amount 10 times.</p><p>These extra matches won more than explain the increase in comebacks above the expected level. They also explain nearly all of the difference between overall expected win percentage based on normal distributions and actual win percentage.</p><p>It appears that the All Blacks have won a lot of games by a tight margin over the last 8 years. Is this a coincidence? If not, do they win tight matches because they are great or are they great because they win tight matches?</p><h1>Footnote</h1><p>Looking back at this now, I wasn't harsh enough on the 2nd question. This wasn't a randomly selected question, it was a statistic specifically chosen by the commentator because it sounds impressive.</p><p>If the null hypothesis is true, p-values should be uniformly distributed between 0 and 1. Assuming there were 10 such statistics which the commentator could have used, it wouldn't be surprising that the most juicy-looking one had p&lt;0.10 even if none of the purported effects were real. Therefore p=0.068 is really thoroughly unimpressive and I would conclude more strongly against the second question being confirmed by the data.</p><p>None of this applies to the first question (better in second half than first half in general) as this wasn't a cherry-picked question - I only asked it because it was important for the second question. It also has a reasonable causal mechanism (relative fitness levels) so I'd be inclined to believe it.</p>",Bucky,bucky,Bucky,

He was also a declared <em>rationalist</em>, although the definition of &quot;rationalist&quot; was a little different from the modern one.  Leibniz never went so far into the technical details of building such a language, to the point that many historians suspect that it never went beyond a simple unattainable aspiration, one of those cases in which the idea turns out to be bigger than the man who gave birth to it. On the other hand, <em>Kurt G&#xF6;del</em> was among the heavyweights who were convinced that Leibniz&apos;s dream was not just a feverish delirium. Yes, the same <em>Kurt G&#xF6;del</em> of the incompleteness theorem. I have no intention of expressing whether <em><strong>characteristica universalis</strong></em> can be possible or not (although a conversation i had with a linguist persuaded me that it is practically infeasible), I prefer to focus on the importance that formal languages &#x200B;&#x200B;have had in the transmutation of human society.</p><p> <br>Scholars define <em>prehistory</em> as the set of events that occurred before the birth of  <em>written language</em> but why is written language so important to the point of being the fundamental marker of our maturity? The <em>gravity</em> of this innovation lies in the fact that it allowed us to note <em>dates</em>,  <em>witnesses</em>, <em>thoughts</em> and this facilitated the work of posterity in reconstructing what came before, what generated the world in which they live, in which <em>we</em> live. Writing has allowed historians the luxury of looking into the past simply by observing <em>words</em>, turning them into scholars of texts. Texts are powerful tools, through them it is possible to share <em>experiences</em>, <em>secret informations</em>,  <em>knowledge</em> and <em>cooking recipes</em>. They are also fundamental for the perpetuation of religious cults. Imagine yourself thousands of years in the past, in the hot and muggy  Indian subcontinent, while writing the <em>Bhagavadgita</em> or the <em>Ramayan</em>a, most likely under the influence of powerful psychotropic substances called &quot;The voice of God&quot;. <br>Or, if you prefer, imagine yourself in ancient Egypt-Israel as you write <em>the old testament</em>: different settings, same story.  <br>Have you ever imagined that your works would have been the most widespread and the most studied in history? That would have given rise to global cults that would last thousands of years? Well maybe you would have imagined it given the omnipotence delirium  that pervaded you while you were writing them.  <br> If you have a preference for modern history you can put yourself in <em>Marx</em>&apos;s shoes in  nineteenth-century Prussia as you write &quot;<em>Das Kapital</em>&quot; and &quot;<em>Manifest der Kommunistischen Partei</em>&quot;. Would have you foreseen the Russian revolution, Stalinism, Cuba and North Korea? I believe I have rattled off enough examples to persuade you of the power of texts. </p><br><p>All the seminal works cited above were written in some <em>natural language </em> which means a language that has evolved naturally, perhaps from a common ancestor, and that men have modified and rearranged  through the act of speaking it. Think of it as Darwinism applied to linguistics. When you talk to your friends, insult your neighbors or your boss, when you declare yourself to your crush, you are doing it through a natural language. However, the natural ones, are not the only languages &#x200B;&#x200B;that exist: remember Leibniz&apos;s <em><strong>characteristica universalis</strong></em>? In fact you&apos;ve certainly heard of <em>formal languages</em>. In my field, computer science, and by extension in mathematics (and of course in linguistics too), formal languages &#x200B;&#x200B;are of fundamental importance. But why is so and what are these languages? To put it in simple terms you can think of formal languages &#x200B;&#x200B;as a <em>subset</em> of natural languages which consists of all the strings (words) built from s<em>ymbols</em> taken from one or more<em> alphabets</em>, to which pre-established <em>rules</em> are applied. These rules, unlike those of natural languages &#x200B;&#x200B;(much more elastic), are not negligible, here we truly speak of grammars carved in granite [These grammars are called (guess what) formal grammars and represent the sets of rules for building formal words. Although we will not focus on formal grammars here, it seems fair to at least list a few: <em><u><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-free_grammar"">context-free grammar</a>,</u></em>  <u><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_grammar"">regular grammars</a>,</u>  <u><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-sensitive_grammar"">Context-sensitive</a></u> ].

The importance and applications of formal languages &#x200B;&#x200B;are uncountable, for example they are used in linguistics to understand certain properties of natural languages &#x200B;&#x200B;(<em>divide et impera</em>). In mathematics they are studied for their combinatorial properties (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorics_on_words"">combinatorics on words</a>) but it is in <em>computer science</em> that they meet their greatest purpose. Once this essay is finished, you will be convinced that <u>computer science is nothing but the study of the associations between words and formal languages</u>. In this discipline we have a fundamental logical model called <em><strong>Turing Machine</strong></em> (synonymous with algorithm) which must perform <em>computations</em> on an input. An input to a <em>TM</em> is <strong>always</strong> a string of symbols, whether in <em>BINARY</em> (Among other things, the invention of the binary code is attributed to Leibniz), <em>ASCII</em>,<em> UNICODE</em> or otherwise encoded. We are often interested in decision problems:  Given an input <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""i""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">i</span></span></span></span></span></span>, does <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""i""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">i</span></span></span></span></span></span> have certain properties?  This kind of problems always have a binary answer: either <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""i""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">i</span></span></span></span></span></span> reflects  the properties we are looking for or it does not. We have already established that <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""i""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">i</span></span></span></span></span></span> is always a string so <u>a decision problem is isomorphic to determining whether or not a word belongs to a formal language</u>.  Any other kind of questions we can run into in computer science, be it an  optimization problem, a counting problem (etc.) can be rephrased as a decision problem.

""Representational art"" means pictures that look like real things. Art school actively discouraged students from getting better at drawing.</p>
<p>""Getting better at drawing"" is off-topic at my weekly local drawing club too. I've literally never heard it discussed.</p>
<p>This taboo extends far beyond art. My nearest gym forbids weightlifters from using electronic systems to log their progress. I'm friends with programmers who can't touch type. None of them use Vim macros.</p>

<p>""I have sometimes suspected that the quickest way to get worried looks from many modern Western meditation teachers is to talk about practice in a way that implies the attempt to actually master anything."" — Daniel M. Ingram</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the part of the United States where I live, the subject of skill is often taboo. Not just relative differences in skill level between specific present individuals (which would make sense). <strong>The implicit acknowledgement of skill as a trainable attribute is taboo.</strong></p>
<p>Not all professions have this issue. Math is still math. Biology is still biology. One can politely discuss a cook's cooking. Magicians respect coin manipulation like it's 1904.</p>
<p>But when traditional colleges supply the labor force for a professional trade outside of academia, that's when discussion of skill (<em>especially</em> rote learning) becomes taboo<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-8di3H4GnfKkXE2nz5-1"" id=""fnref-8di3H4GnfKkXE2nz5-1"">[1]</a></sup>. College students learn everything about their trade except how to do it. Then we maintain a collective silence concerning technique.</p>
<ul>
<li>A Chinese major teaches you how to talk about Chinese, not how to read it.</li>
<li>An English major teaches you how to talk about novels, not how to write one.</li>
<li>An art major teaches you how to talk about masterpieces, not how to create one.</li>
<li>A Computer Science Engineering major…well, you get the idea.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's a partial explanation, but it doesn't explain why skill differences in weightlifting and meditation are also taboo.</p>
<p>Societies make taboo exactly those topics whose mere discussion threatens the precarious dominance of those at the top of the social order by drawing attention to the system's internal contradictions.</p>

I might have seen a home insurance company in Ohio that had fifty million dollars in reserve, then would buy reinsurance for hurricanes that covered all losses greater than ten and less than twenty five million dollars. Yes, there are hurricanes that impact Ohio, such as Xenia in 1974 and Ike in 2008, but they weren&#x2019;t large enough to even hit the minimum for this type of policy. Not only that, but the company had money in reserves to cover this incredibly unlikely loss, and buying reinsurance isn&apos;t cheap. Let&#x2019;s say that between brokers, transaction costs, and everything else, it cost them a hundred thousand dollars to cover an expected loss of ten thousand dollars. </p><p>Noticing this, I asked why they wanted this policy. My boss told me it was a sleeping pill. He explained that the CEO of the insurance company would get really nervous and unhappy every time a hurricane was approaching the US, and decided this CEO didn&#x2019;t want to worry anymore. That isn&#x2019;t unreasonable - most people who buy travel insurance to cover their $1,000 vacation could just accept the risk, but they prefer not to worry. </p><p>In general, buying risk mitigation isn&#x2019;t worth the cost in expected value terms, but they are worthwhile because they can buy off the worry. In this case, it&#x2019;s less innocuous, since the CEO was using company money to buy what amounted to personal sleeping pills. It happens because the CEO won&#x2019;t ever be blamed for hedging the risk, and it cost the company a hundred thousand dollars per year, which was not enough for shareholders to notice.</p><h3>Theater Tickets</h3><p>Once, we received a request from a client to train them in using the terrorism risk model they licensed. That&#x2019;s not unusual, but they said that they wanted us to first come and install the software, then do a half day training. This seemed weird, since they had been licensing the software for several years, and we assumed they would have already installed it. They hadn&#x2019;t.</p><p>The software licenses weren&#x2019;t cheap - I don&#x2019;t remember the client or the amount, but it was easily a six-figure sum every year. Why did they pay if they didn&#x2019;t even use the model? It was what Bruce Schnier calls &#x201C;Security Theater,&#x201D; referring to acts that do nothing to change the risk, but look good. In this case, they wanted to tell their shareholders in their annual report that they had a model for assessing their terrorism risk, and six-figures was cheap to be able to put on the show of risk-management and mitigation for their shareholders. In this case, they didn&#x2019;t even need to put on a show - just waving the tickets they bought was enough. They paid money not to mitigate risk, but simply to make it look like they did.</p><h3>Staying Out of the Pool</h3><p>There&#x2019;s another phenomenon where managers don&#x2019;t want to take risks that are good for the company but risky for their division - and their careers. The typical version is explained in a 1966 article in Harvard Business Review, &quot;Utility theory, insights into risk taking.&quot; They asked managers if they&#x2019;d take a 50-50 chance on a project that would either make $300,000, or lose $60,000, and the managers mostly said no.</p><p>The reason this is a bad decision is that even if the company prefers to avoid large risks, the company should want middle-managers to be taking smaller risks. They want small risks because there are lots of them, and in aggregate - by pooling the risks - the company is far better off having managers take them. For a single bet, the expected return is $120,000, but there&#x2019;s a 50% chance of not only not coming out even, but actually losing money. If 6 managers took similar (uncorrelated) bets, the expected value is six times as large - it scales linearly - but the probability of losing money in that case is <span><style>.mjx-chtml {display: inline-block; line-height: 0; text-indent: 0; text-align: left; text-transform: none; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 100%; font-size-adjust: none; letter-spacing: normal; word-wrap: normal; word-spacing: normal; white-space: nowrap; float: none; direction: ltr; max-width: none; max-height: none; min-width: 0; min-height: 0; border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 1px 0}

Since they explicitly model the risks of the insurance contracts, and the entire reason insurance works is risk pooling, they are far better equipped to handle the problem. Still, underwriters get paid their bonus based on their performance, one that likely won&#x2019;t materialize if they are net negative for the year. So even here, you see a hesitation for the individuals to get into the (risk) pool.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>None of these are new insights or issues. All of them are simple combinations of a principal-agent issue and risk aversion. Still, in addition to reinforcing the ideas, they are worth thinking about when we have one person or group of people mitigate risks for others. The obvious places are in the corporate world, and in government, and if you look around, you&#x2019;ll see that these dynamics are all common.</p>",Davidmanheim,davidmanheim,Davidmanheim,

That's because the most interesting numbers are precisely those located in directions conceptually orthogonal to whatever numbers you've already explored.</p>
<p>The easiest concepts to learn are the ideas ahead of you on a path you're already taking. If you know classical mechanics then it's straightforward to learn relativity. You could crack turbulence without ever changing fields.</p>
<p>The second-easiest things to learn are those outside your specialization but inside of your culture's intellectual tradition. If you grew up in the West then you know there are such things as physics and painting even if you never learned how to do them.</p>
<p>The second-hardest things to learn are those outside your society's intellectual tradition. Consider for example <em>kenshō</em><sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-bCK9hGDKvoXAGccE8-1"" id=""fnref-bCK9hGDKvoXAGccE8-1"">[1]</a></sup>. It's possible to live an entire lifetime outside of Japan without ever discovering that such a concept exists. Westerners don't choose not to experience <em>kenshō</em>. This choice is made <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/k6nncsXAZD3bK6fe3/invisible-choices-made-by-default"">invisibly</a>.</p>
<p>The hardest things to learn are those belonging to domains of knowledge which haven't been (openly) conceptualized anywhere, such as photography before the invention of the camera. This category includes zero-day exploits.</p>
<p>We can number each kind of conceptual hole from least to most orthogonal.</p>
<ul>
<li>Type 1: Concepts you are aware of but do not understand.</li>
<li>Type 2: Concepts you are not aware of, but which belong to a field you are aware of.</li>
<li>Type 3: Fields of knowledge you do not know exist, but which exist.</li>
<li>Type 4: Fields of knowledge that remain genuinely secret or have not been invented.</li>
</ul>
<p>Expertise is about mastering one field, but general intelligence is how prepared you are for something new. The more different kinds of concepts you understand the better you will be at solving new kinds of problems. This is behind the principle of learning that breadth of knowledge equals breadth of transference.</p>
<p>Filling holes of Type 1 is how you build expertise in a field. Holes of Types 2-4 are better for building broader (and therefore more transferable) knowledge. In other words, holes of greater-numbered types are better for increasing your general intelligence. If this is your goal then holes of Type 2 and 3 are the most valuable.</p>
<p>I find holes of Type 3 to be so valuable that just knowing where they are improves my creativity at solving problems. (It also turns them into holes of Type 2.) You can find holes of Type 3 systematically by mastering the language of a sufficiently foreign culture. I know this works with written Chinese and spoken Pirahã. I hypothesize it's also true of Arabic, ASL, Korean and the Khoisan languages.</p>
<p>Filling holes of Type 2 is almost straightforward. Pick anything you're bad at that lots of other people do and develop a basic competence. This turns holes of Type 2 into holes of Type 1.</p>
<p>Holes of Type 4 can be individually very valuable. That is, a single hole of Type 4 can earn you lots of power and money. But holes of Type 4 are so hard to find, verify and exploit that you can't build a broad base of knowledge out of them.</p>
<p>I like collecting conceptual holes, especially those of Types 2 and 3. They're so interesting. Whenever I discover a new hole it opens up an entire tree of knowledge orthogonal to everything I used to know.</p>

Ric6wFiETXzBLBRYZ,When do you start looking for a Boston apartment?,when-do-you-start-looking-for-a-boston-apartment,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Ric6wFiETXzBLBRYZ/when-do-you-start-looking-for-a-boston-apartment,2019-10-29T16:30:01.716Z,9,3,3,False,False,,"<p>

A huge fraction of Boston-area apartments are on a September 1st to
September 1st lease cycle.  This is driven by college student rentals,
but the whole city has ended up on the same pattern.  So you might
expect to see the most apartment listings in August or maybe July?
Nope:

<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/number-of-boston-apartment-listings-big.png""><img src=""https://www.jefftk.com/number-of-boston-apartment-listings-2x.png"" /></a>

</p>

<p>

The peak is in late spring, May-Jun, about a hundred days out.  It's
not as dramatic as what I saw with one year's data <a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/boston-is-a-september-1st-town"">in 2013</a>, but people are
planning way ahead.  I think this might be driven by students lining
up housing before they leave for the summer?

</p>

<p>

This matches my experience looking for apartments and lining up
housemates: if you have strong preferences or want an especially good
fit you need to start looking in the late Spring.

They indicate a long-term problem where a muscle <em>(via its connective tissue attachment)</em> is pulling on its periosteal attachment causing the periosteum to react.</p><p>♢ Osteochondrophytes occur at the cartilage-bone junction, in response cartilage damage. This can be due to acute trauma, but more commonly is ""wear and tear"" <em>(degenerative joint disease, osteoarthritis)</em>. Are osteochondrophytes also due to long-term misusage of the main muscles of movement?</p><p><em>An MRI after rock-bottom was comforting.

bHBif2wJ2GSo69ZAr,On Internal Family Systems and multi-agent minds: a reply to PJ Eby,on-internal-family-systems-and-multi-agent-minds-a-reply-to,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/bHBif2wJ2GSo69ZAr/on-internal-family-systems-and-multi-agent-minds-a-reply-to,2019-10-29T14:56:19.590Z,41,19,31,False,False,,"<h1>Introduction</h1><p>I recently had a conversation with <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/users/pjeby"">PJ Eby</a> in the comments of my article “<u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5gfqG3Xcopscta3st/building-up-to-an-internal-family-systems-model"">Building up to an Internal Family Systems model</a></u>”. My most recent reply to it started getting rather long, and is also more broadly relevant as it contains updates on how I view IFS and the multi-agent framework in general. As a result, I decided to post it as its own article.</p><p>pjeby’s comments that I’m replying to are <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5gfqG3Xcopscta3st/building-up-to-an-internal-family-systems-model?commentId=Psam7HjaweiGdwfF9"">here</a></u> and <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5gfqG3Xcopscta3st/building-up-to-an-internal-family-systems-model#6SiEgyhrdAJiDj4jp"">here</a></u>; to verify that I understood him correctly, I wrote a summary of what I took to be his core points (below). He mostly endorsed them as correct, while having a few clarifications; the below summary has incorporated those corrections. After listing all of his points, I will present my own replies.</p><p>The summary is divided into two parts. Earlier on, pjeby wondered why IFS was popular among rationalists; one of the things I said in response was that rationalists like reductionism, and IFS helps reduce the mind into smaller components. pjeby felt that IFS is not good reductionism. My response goes into detail about what kinds of claims I view IFS as making, how I interpret those in terms of my multi-agent minds series, and how I would now rephrase my original article differently. Here I feel like I broadly agree with pjeby, and feel that our disagreement has more to do with using terminology differently than it does with actual object-level issues.</p><p>The second part concerns the practical usefulness of IFS as a therapeutic model. After all, a model can be <em>useful</em> while still not being <em>true</em>. Here I have more disagreement, and feel that (regardless of how good it is as a literal description of the mind) IFS has considerable practical value.</p><p>This article assumes that one has read my later article about <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/i9xyZBS3qzA8nFXNQ/book-summary-unlocking-the-emotional-brain"">Unlocking the Emotional Brain</a></u>, as I reference concepts from it.</p><h1>My summary of pjeby’s positions</h1><h2>IFS as a reductionist model</h2><ul><li>Good reductionism involves breaking down complex things into simpler parts. In the case of doing reductionism on agents, the end result should be mechanisms without agency. IFS ""breaks down"" behavior into mini-people inside our heads, each mini-person still being just as agenty as a full person is. This isn't simplifying anything.</li><li>Talking about subagents/parts or using intentional language causes people to assign things properties that they actually don't have. If you say that a thermostat ""wants"" the temperature to be something in particular, or that a part ""wants"" to keep you safe, then you will predict its behavior to be more flexible and strategic than it really is.</li><li>The mechanisms behind emotional issues aren't doing anything agentic, such as strategically planning ahead for the purpose of achieving a goal. Rather they are relatively simple rules which are used to trigger built-in subsystems that have evolved to run particular action patterns (punishing, protesting, idealistic virtue signalling, etc.). The various rules in question are built up / selected for using different reinforcement learning mechanisms, and define when the subsystems should be activated (in response to what kind of a cue) and how (e.g. who should be the target of the punishing).</li><li>Reinforcement learning does not need to have global coherence. Seemingly contradictory behaviors can be explained by e.g. a particular action being externally reinforced or becoming self-reinforcing, all the while it causes globally negative consequences despite being locally positive.</li><li>On the other hand, IFS seems to imply that there is dedicated hardware for each instance of an action pattern: each part corresponds to something like an evolved module in the brain, and each instance of a negative behavior/emotion corresponds to a separate part. Even if IFS does not assume it, then at least <em>this</em> article <em>is</em> assuming dedicated agents actually existing.</li><li>The assumption of dedicated hardware for each instance of an action pattern is multiplying entities beyond necessity. The kinds of reinforcement learning systems that have been described can generate the same kinds of behaviors with much less dedicated hardware. You just need the learning systems, which then learn rules for when and how to trigger a much smaller number of dedicated subsystems.</li><li>The assumption of dedicated hardware for each instance of an action pattern also contradicts the reconsolidation model, because if each part was a piece of built-in hardware, then you couldn't just entirely change its behavior through changing earlier learning.</li><li>Everything in IFS could be described more simply in terms of if-then rules, reinforcement learning etc.; if you do this, you don't need the metaphor of ""parts"", and you also have a more correct model which does actual reduction to simpler components.</li></ul><h2>IFS as a therapeutic approach:</h2><ul><li>Approaching things from an IFS framework can be useful when working with clients with severe trauma, or other cases when the client is not ready/willing to directly deal with some of their material. However, outside that context (and even within it), IFS has a number of issues which make it much less effective than a non-parts-based approach.</li><li>Thinking about experiences like ""being in distress"" or ""inner criticism"" as parts that can be changed suggests that one could somehow completely eliminate those. But while triggers to pre-existing brain systems can be eliminated or changed, those brain systems themselves cannot. This means that it's useless to try to get rid of such experiences entirely. One should rather focus on the memories which shape the rules that activate such systems.</li><li>Knowing this also makes it easier to unblend, because you understand that what is activated is a more general subsystem, rather than a very specific part.</li><li>If you experience your actions and behaviors being as caused by subagents with their own desires, you will feel less in control of your life and more at the mercy of your subagents. This is a nice crutch for people with denial issues who want to disclaim their own desires, but not a framework that would enable you to actually have more control over your life.</li><li>""Negotiating with parts"" buys into the above denial and has you do playacting inside your head without really getting into the memories which created the schemas in the first place. If you knew about reconsolidation, you could just target the memories directly, and bypass the extra hassle.</li><li>""Developing self-leadership"" involves practicing a desired behavior to override an old one; this is what Unlocking the Emotional Brain calls a counteractive strategy, and is fragile in all the ways that UtEB describes. It would be much more effective to just use a reconsolidation-based approach.</li><li>IFS makes it hard to surface the assumptions behind behavior, because one is stuck in the frame of negotiating with mini-people inside one's head, rather than looking at the underlying memories and assumptions. Possibly an experienced IFS therapist can help look for those assumptions, but then one might as well use a non-parts-based framework.</li><li>Even when the therapist does know what to look for, the fact that IFS does not have a direct model of evidence and counterevidence makes it hard to find the interventions that will actually trigger reconsolidation. Rather one just acts out various behaviors which may trigger reconsolidation if they happen to hit the right pattern.</li><li>Besides the issue with luck, IFS does not really have the concept of a schema which keeps interpreting behaviors in light of its existing model, and thus filtering out all the counter-evidence the playacting might otherwise have contained. A skilled IFS therapist paying attention might notice this happening and deal with it, but such a good therapist could probably get results with any therapy model that gave them sufficient freedom to notice and address the issue.</li></ul><h1>My responses</h1><h2>IFS as a reductionist model:</h2><ul><li><strong>Good reductionism involves breaking down complex things into simpler parts. In the case of doing reductionism on agents, the end result should be mechanisms without agency. IFS ""breaks down"" behavior into mini-people inside our heads, each mini-person still being just as agenty as a full person is. This isn't simplifying anything.</strong></li></ul><p>I agree that IFS feels pretty anthropomorphic, and especially if you take the subpersonalities thing too literally, it’s going to guide you away from more correct models. And I agree that reducing things to subpersonalities isn’t really reducing things to simpler mechanisms.</p><p>That said, there are degrees of correctness and wrongness. We got into the discussion about reductionism when pjeby wondered why IFS was so popular among rationalists, and I suggested that it might be in part because rationalists like reductionism. Now, maybe reductionism was a bad term, and I should have used something like “rationalists like having better models"" instead. </p><p>In any case, what I was trying to say was that even if IFS isn’t great reductionism, it’s still a <em>better</em> model than a naïve conception of the mind as a unified whole. Even if some aspects of it are misleading, “this person is doing self-destructive things because of a firefighter response to a triggered exile” is better than “this person is doing self-destructive things because they are too stupid or irresponsible to act better”. </p><p>I think the main virtue of IFS is just that it breaks down the mind into, well, parts, each containing different perspectives and goals. There are many interpretations of IFS; some go with the full-blown “subpersonalities” approach, whereas some just consider the subpersonalities a metaphor for something fundamentally non-agenty. Even the first edition of the <em>Internal Family Systems Therapy</em> textbook noted that while in the author’s experience, the system works better if you treat parts as independent entities, many IFS therapists just treat them as metaphors and that this works too:</p><blockquote>To use the IFS model, one does not have to believe in an ontological sense that parts are internal people. Many therapists view this depiction merely as a useful metaphor and have success with the approach. From a pragmatic perspective, however, the inhabitants of our internal systems respond best to that kind of respect, so it is best to treat them that way—to attribute to them human qualities and responses. Some therapists resolve this problem by not viewing parts as people when they are theorizing, but seeing them as inner people when they are treating clients.</blockquote><p>In our previous discussion, there were moments when I said something like “if you treat the mind as a reinforcement learning system, then that predicts X which doesn’t actually match human behavior, but if you treat the mind as an IFS-like system, then that makes more sense”. pjeby <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5gfqG3Xcopscta3st/building-up-to-an-internal-family-systems-model?commentId=MCKfPhStCgrGKEJYm"">responded</a></u> by pointing out that reinforcement learning does not need to be globally coherent, and things can actually be explained fine in a reinforcement learning framework if one postulates various local RL mechanisms. I think we were talking past each other, because an RL framework with local mechanisms is the kind of thing that I <em>meant</em> by ""an IFS-like system"". </p><p>The distinction that I was drawing was between “a unified top-down system of the kind that one finds in folk psychology or most contemporary AI designs” on the one hand, versus “a system made up of many distinct learning mechanisms and knowledge stores” on the other. When I said that IFS might be popular among rationalists because they like reductionism, I just meant that IFS is a good model for many because it naturally guides people towards thinking along the latter kinds of lines.</p><p>E.g. <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5gfqG3Xcopscta3st/building-up-to-an-internal-family-systems-model?commentId=f9TKJ9YkjCz426xuu"">the most top-voted comment</a></u> on my IFS article says that what it suggests “about procrastination and addiction alone [...] are already huge”, so even in 2019, many rationalists found the IFS model to be <em>better</em> at offering explanations than any other model. Here's <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/3pwikSmxeieybyJSi/hazard-s-shortform-feed?commentId=ectZG5ydPjDJMDPvX"">another recent comment</a> that seems to have moved towards a latter kind of model through the IFS frame: </p><blockquote>Over this past year I've been thinking more in terms of ""Much of my behavior exists because it was made as a mechanism to meet a need at some point.""</blockquote><blockquote>Ideas that flow out of this frame seem to be things like Internal Family Systems, and ""if I want to change behavior, I have to actually make sure that need is getting met.""</blockquote><p>Of course, pjeby’s point was that there are <em>even better</em> models than what one gets from IFS; and I agree. The IFS model was one of the starting points of my sequence, but my later ones have been moving more explicitly towards a UtEB kind of model. The intention of my comment was descriptive rather than prescriptive; that historically, the IFS model has been popular because it’s pragmatically useful <em>and</em> because, despite its possible flaws, rationalists haven’t been exposed to any better models. </p><ul><li><strong>Talking about subagents/parts or using intentional language causes people to assign things properties that they actually don't have. If you say that a thermostat ""wants"" the temperature to be something in particular, or that a part ""wants"" to keep you safe, then you will predict its behavior to be more flexible and strategic than it really is.</strong></li></ul><p>I agree that excessive anthropomorphization is a possible issue with both IFS in particular and intentional language in general. As pjeby says, it can cause people to misapply mental models derived from full-blown humans into parts of the psyche, preventing people from realizing what’s going on. (In fact, this was one of the main reasons why I stayed away from IFS for a long time, since it sounded like naïve folk psychology at best.)</p><p>Though I don’t think it’s <em>necessarily</em> a problem. When pjeby <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5gfqG3Xcopscta3st/building-up-to-an-internal-family-systems-model?commentId=Psam7HjaweiGdwfF9"">said</a></u></p><blockquote>… if you actually want to predict how a thermostat behaves, using the brain's built-in model of ""thing with intentional stance"", you're making your model worse. If you model the thermostat as, ""thing that 'wants' the house a certain temperature"", then you'll be confused when somebody sticks an ice cube or teapot underneath it, or when the temperature sensor breaks.</blockquote><p>… then it’s worth noting that the reason why this example works is that neither of us is actually going to make that kind of a mistake. We know enough about mechanical stuff to realize that what’s meant by “wanting” in this context, and what its limitations are.</p><p>Now again, it’s true that if you <em>don’t</em> know anything about mechanical stuff, then you will be misled. On the other hand, if you do know enough to understand what’s meant, then it’s a convenient shorthard and aid for thinking. Evolutionary biologists might talk about e.g. “evolution selecting for a trait”, which makes evolution sound like an agent which is doing things, even though they fully well know what’s actually happening.</p><p>In one comment, I said that the parts in IFS feel basically like the <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/i9xyZBS3qzA8nFXNQ/book-summary-unlocking-the-emotional-brain"">schemas in UtEB</a> to me, and pjeby replied:</p><blockquote>A ""model"" is passive: it merely outputs predictions or evaluations, which are then acted on by other parts of the brain. It doesn't have any goals, it just blindly maps situations to ""things that might be good to do or avoid"". An ""agent"" is implicitly active and goal-seeking, whereas a model is not.</blockquote><p>But suppose that we have these descriptions:</p><p>Agenty: A manager part scans the environment for things it considers threats, taking a particular action whenever it detects something that it considers a potential sign of threat.</p><p>Passive: A model contains a record of some kinds of sensory inputs which have previously been associated with negative consequences, and also contains an action to be taken in response. When cues matching that record are detected in the system’s sensory input, the system takes the corresponding action.</p><p>… then the “passive” version sounds to me like it’s just a description of how the “agenty” version is implemented. Especially if one knows (as I assume LW readers to know) that there’s no clear-cut distinction between code and data, or that the distinction is even messier in the brain. </p><p>The most famous society of mind model is probably Minsky's <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_of_Mind"">Society of Mind</a>; and while it seems to define ""agents"" in different ways in different chapters, some of them seem <em>very</em> low-level. I recall one chapter which sounded a lot like the ""agents"" in it were individual nodes in a neural network; another chapter had agents like ""the add operation"". So it doesn't feel like talking about ""agents"" would <em>necessarily</em> imply a lot of agency.</p><p>But then on the third hand, I again agree that the potential for being misled is still there - especially since I got slightly misled myself, when I wrote my IFS post and formulated things in terms of the “subagents” themselves doing reinforcement learning. I’ve been moving away from that kind of a formulation in my later posts, and would write this post differently if I were to do it now. Maybe I should change the name of the sequence from “multiagent minds” while I’m at it, but then I would need to think of some equally catchy name. :-)</p><p>On the fourth hand, there <em>are</em> things in my IFS post which, despite being framed in an agenty way, I think are still formally equivalent to a more passive formulation. E.g. I talked about subagents voting for different objects they wish to become the content of consciousness, and the winner being randomly determined based on the vote counts; this still seems like a fair way of describing things like <u><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winner-take-all_(computing)"">winner-take-all networks</a></u> or <u><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biased_Competition_Theory"">biased competition</a></u>, assuming stochasticity in the process.</p><ul><li><strong>The real mechanisms behind emotional issues aren't really doing anything agentic, such as strategically planning ahead for the purpose of achieving a goal. Rather they are relatively simple rules used to trigger built-in subsystems that have evolved to run particular kinds of action patterns (punishing, protesting, idealistic virtue signalling, etc.). The various rules in question are built up / selected for using different reinforcement learning mechanisms, and define when the subsystems should be activated (in response to what kind of a cue) and how (e.g. who should be the target of the punishing).</strong></li></ul><p>I like this model. It’s similar to what I’ve been moving towards in my more recent posts, and reminds me of e.g. <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/rP9nPwg7gRe5mTSDz/kaj-s-shortform-feed/comment/R5LRCR6esnn2i5xdk"">Janina Fisher’s model</a>, but is more precise about what exactly is happening. </p><ul><li><strong>Reinforcement learning does not need global coherence. Seemingly contradictory behaviors can be explained by e.g. a particular action being externally reinforced or becoming self-reinforcing, all the while it causes globally negative consequences despite being locally positive.</strong></li></ul><p>Yes, I agree. In e.g. my post on <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/oJwJzeZ6ar2Hr7KAX/subagents-akrasia-and-coherence-in-humans"">subagents and coherence</a></u>, I specifically talked about the overall system doing learning on which subsystems to activate in different situations, based on local considerations such as which subsystems have previously made accurate predictions. And my post on <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7zQPYQB5EeaqLrhBh/subagents-neural-turing-machines-thought-selection-and"">neural Turing machines</a> tried to sketch out some of those mechanisms. </p><p>When I said that reinforcement learning alone couldn’t explain some behaviors, I was again drawing the distinction between “a unified top-down system” vs. “a system made up of many distinct learning mechanisms and knowledge stores”. I was interpreting “reinforcement learning” as an instance of the former, because my model of the mechanisms behind IFS already involves the kinds of RL mechanisms that pjeby has been describing.</p><ul><li><strong>On the other hand, IFS seems to imply that there is dedicated hardware for each instance of an action pattern: each part corresponds to something like an evolved module in the brain, and each instance of a negative behavior/emotion corresponds to a separate part. Even if IFS does not assume it, then at least <em>this</em> article <em>is</em> assuming dedicated agents actually existing (whether in software or hardware).</strong></li><li><strong>The assumption of dedicated hardware for each instance of an action pattern is multiplying entities beyond necessity.

Again, if I were to re-write my IFS article now, I would model things somewhat differently. Though again, I don’t see there being that big of a difference between “a dedicated agent” and “a dedicated set of rules”, once you have a correct understanding of what “agent” means. And when you do have that understanding, you might as well use the “agent” term as a convenient shorthand.</p><p>Honestly, IFS doesn’t seem to be really clear on exactly how specific/general the parts are interpreted to be. To some extent, this might be because of IFS’s general philosophy of investigating each client as a unique system and not imposing too much of a pre-existing theoretical framework on them. </p><p>The second edition of the Internal Family Systems Therapy book has a mention of an infant researcher who “observed infants rotating among four or five discrete states, which we would call parts”, suggesting a stance of interpreting parts as pretty general brain systems; likewise when it suggests that a new part has come online when a previously compliant 2-year-old wakes up one day and insists on saying “no” to everything. But then in practical work, a lot of the parts seem a lot more specific. </p><p>My guess is that the “interface” used for creating the appearance of parts isn’t really that specific and may sometimes target narrower and sometimes broader wholes; e.g. it might access one specific schema or set of experiences, and sometimes a collection of interrelated schemas (referred to when IFS claims that “parts have parts”). Still, it seems still reasonable to me to think that IFS's parts <em>generally</em> correspond to something like UtEB's schemas.</p><p>Also worth noting that the second edition of Internal Family Systems Therapy explicitly references the memory reconsolidation model as a possible explanation of how parts are healed:</p><blockquote>Our colleague Frank Anderson (2013) has pioneered using IFS in psychopharmacology. In the manual on IFS that we coauthored with Frank, he speculated that the IFS steps of witnessing and unburdening may correlate with a process neuroscientists call <em>memory reconsolidation</em>, a form of neuroplasticity described by Ecker, Ticic, Hulley, and Neimeyer (2012) that “changes existing emotional memory at the synaptic level” (Anderson et al., 2017, p. 127). In contrast to memory reconsolidation, a therapy like cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) uses counteractive change strategies, which focus on developing new neural networks to counter older neural networks. As described in the manual, memory reconsolidation includes four phases. The first involves getting <em>access</em> to the traumatic memory. In IFS this would be finding, focusing, and fleshing out the target part. The second phase involves <em>reactivation</em> or destabilizing the emotional memory network and unlocking it at the synaptic level. In IFS this would be unblending, in which parts make room for the client’s Self. The third phase involves the <em>mismatch</em>, which is “a full disconfirmation of the meaning of the target memory” (Anderson et al., 2017, p. 127). In IFS this would occur during the process of witnessing and retrieving exiled parts. Finally, the fourth phase, <em>erasure</em>, involves clients making use of a new perspective to amend their understanding of the traumatic experience. In IFS this would happen when exiles let go of their burdens because the Self has a validating,  nontraumatic perspective on the meaning of the part’s experience: <em>You’re not bad—a bad thing happened to you.</em> </blockquote><h2>The practical usefulness of IFS as a therapeutic approach</h2><ul><li><strong>Approaching things from an IFS framework can be useful when working with clients with severe trauma, or other cases when the client is not ready/willing to directly deal with some of their material. However, outside that context (and even within it), IFS has a number of issues which make it much less effective than a non-parts-based approach.</strong></li><li><strong>Thinking about experiences like ""being in distress"" or ""inner criticism"" as parts that can be changed suggests that one could somehow completely eliminate those. But while triggers to pre-existing brain systems can be eliminated or changed, those brain systems themselves cannot. This means that it's useless to try to get rid of such experiences entirely. One should rather focus on the memories which shape the rules that activate such systems.</strong></li></ul><p>Note that IFS doesn’t really advocate getting <em>rid of</em> e.g. anger either, but rather transforming angry parts so that they are less extreme. That is, don’t get angry when it would be a bad idea, only get angry when it’s a good idea. This seems basically the same as what pjeby is saying: change the rules which regulate how the different systems are triggered.</p><p>Of course, it’s still possible to get the impression that one could somehow entirely eliminate particular response patterns. But is the other model any safer from a similar interpretation? If the IFS-user-who-never-wanted-to-be-angry thought “I will transform all of my angry parts so that I’m never angry anymore”, then the UtEB-mindhacker-who-never-wants-to-be-angry might think “I will eliminate all of the rules which trigger the angriness subsystem, and then that system will never get triggered anymore”. </p><p>I would expect both to fail for the same reason (being motivated by an anti-angriness schema rather than a desire to actually find the best response for any given situation), but I don’t see the UtEB-style framework offering any particular defense against this failure mode.</p><ul><li><strong>Knowing this also makes it easier to unblend, because you understand that what is activated is a more general subsystem, rather than a very specific part.</strong></li></ul><p>I tried this a bit the other day when I had some mild anxiety, intentionally reframing the experience as a subsystem being activated rather than a part. I think it might have made it <em>slightly</em> easier to unblend, but it was honestly probably mostly placebo effect from trying something new? Not sure why one would expect it to make a difference which frame you use; maybe if you thought of the part as actively fighting back or something, then that would introduce extra effort into the unblending process. But in both frames, you are choosing to interpret the reaction as something distinct from “you”, and paying attention to features which let you distinguish it from “yourself”. That seems to be crucial ingredient, rather than one’s interpretation of what <em>exactly</em> it is that one is unblending from.</p><ul><li><strong>If you experience your actions and behaviors being caused by subagents with their own desires, you will feel less in control of your life and more at the mercy of your subagents. This is a nice crutch for people with denial issues who want to disclaim their own desires, but not a framework that would enable you to actually have more control over your life.</strong></li></ul><p>I guess this could be a problem if you experienced your subagents as being really strong and independent and hard to reason with. But the IFS notion of all parts - even the most malicious and “evil-seeming” ones - fundamentally wanting your best, and its super-cooperative attitude towards them, seems to be good at framing things in a way that avoids this impression. If anything, people often feel liberated when they use IFS techniques and <em>stop</em> experiencing a part as something that torments them and who they are at the mercy of, and come to view it as a friend and an ally instead.</p><p>Of course, if one does have a schema that guides them into strong helplessness behaviors or into denial, then they can just filter out those parts of the IFS framing and get something like the denial-supporting model described. But again, I’m not sure if there’s anything in another framework either that would prevent one from forming an equivalent interpretation? Instead of feeling at the mercy of your subagents, you would feel at the mercy of your schemas and rules for triggering subsystems.</p><p>Introspecting on my own experience, I feel like the rule-based framing might actually put me <em>more</em> into the “denying my own desires” mode. It primes me to think along the lines of “oh, all of my bad behaviors are just caused by bad irrational rules, I’ll use consolidation techniques to rewrite all of them”. Whereas if I model myself as IFS-like parts, then I think more along the lines of “hmm, all of my parts have some good intention for me and some reason for acting the way they do, let me see if they might have some important insight that I’ve missed”. (Which, in my experience, is a stance that gets much better results. SaraHax <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/KaByYSRwSLdscGYB6/actually-updating"">reports similar things</a>.)</p><ul><li><strong>""Negotiating with parts"" buys into the above denial, and has you do playacting inside your head without really getting into the memories which created the schemas in the first place. If you knew about reconsolidation, you could just target the memories directly, and bypass all of the extra hassle.</strong></li></ul><p>This doesn’t really describe my experience of IFS. My feeling (both from doing IFS personally and facilitating it to others) is that it is not so much playacting, but rather basically just Focusing with a slightly different frame. Mark Lippmann describes IFS as “<u><a href=""https://meditationstuff.wordpress.com/2014/09/19/diminishing-returns-and-why-keep-pushing-at-the-focusing-type-stuff/"">a structured super-charger for Focusing</a></u>”, and notes that Focusing, IFS and Coherence Therapy seem to all be doing basically the same thing, with slight variations in the framing and questions that are used giving you radically different answers.</p><p>Let’s go with UtEB’s model of schemas containing a problem, solution, and memories that formed the schema. Again in my experience, “protectors” seem to correspond to the problem and solution parts of the schema, and “exiles” to the original experiences giving rise to that schema. </p><p>pjeby says that “if you knew about reconsolidation, you could just target the memories directly”, but AFAICT, the questions that IFS suggests you ask your protectors <em>are</em> intended to give you access to the memories directly. One is asking questions like “what is the goal of this part”, “what is the part afraid that would happen if it didn’t do its job” (note that this one is basically the same as what Richard was asked to imagine in the UtEB example), and “what is this part’s core belief”. These are all queries for eliciting more information about the schema in question; the reason why one fleshes out a part's appearance is to get a stronger felt sense handle to run those queries against.</p><p>“Negotiating with parts” seems to likewise be about passing information between conflicting schemas (this is more explicit in CFAR’s IDC technique, which is basically IFS without the stuff about healing exiles). One schema says that you should go into a particular situation, another says that it’s dangerous. So you elicit information from the schema which knows about the dangers and pass it to the pro-active schema, reconsolidating its model of “going to this situation would be a pure win”, and getting a more nuanced prediction about how the danger could be avoided. Then you pass it back to the objecting schema, reconsolidating it in turn, until the two schemas return a compatible prediction and you know how you should proceed.</p><p>IFS claims, and this has often also often been my experience, that if you can access the exile (the original memories behind the schema) from a place of Self, then healing will happen naturally and intuitively. pjeby suggests that this happens mostly accidentally, if the person happens to hit upon the right behaviors to trigger the reconsolidation. But my experience doesn’t support that: if I have proper access to an exile and I’m truly in Self, the right behaviors come intuitively and reliably (maybe with just a bit of nudging from the therapist/facilitator), as IFS suggests.</p><p>My model is that the mind is wired to avoid discomfort, and that schemas tend to contain the implicit assumption of “if memories relating to this experience are triggered, then that will always make me feel horrible, so I need to avoid that”. For example: you weren’t polite to your parents and you got shamed for it. This is a problem to be solved (in the Coherence Therapy sense): impoliteness will lead to social disapproval. The knowledge of this problem is neurally encoded by associating the feeling of shame together with the memory/concept of being impolite. </p><p>My key assumption here is that unlike the logical brain, the emotional brain does not have a concept of social disapproval being bad for instrumental reasons. Rather, social disapproval is bad <em>because it triggers bad feelings</em>, and the emotional brain is optimizing for the avoidance of bad feelings rather than for the avoidance of objectively observable circumstances. Thus, on the evolutionary level, brains are wired to avoid social disapproval because it is bad for survival; but on an algorithmic level, the emotional brain is wired to avoid social disapproval because social disapproval causes shame (presumably produced by some separate shame module).</p><p>So the concepts of impoliteness and shame become linked together to create a self-fulfilling prediction: experiencing yourself as impolite triggers shame through the link. The brain's reinforcement learning machinery comes to anticipate this and starts developing strategies for avoiding that experience. This prediction of (impoliteness -&gt; shame) is reinforced each time when you experience or remember being impolite, and feel the corresponding emotion.</p><p>But when you experience the original painful memory from a place of Self, then you are recalling it <em>without</em> also feeling horrible. Similar to Richard noticing that confidence does not automatically lead to social rejection, this is counterevidence to the expectation of impoliteness always causing you to be shamed. This acts as a juxtaposition experience, eliminating the system's need to compulsively avoid impoliteness... and in so doing, reconsolidates the concept of impoliteness so as to remove the link to feelings of shame, meaning that the concept will no longer trigger shame.</p><p>E.g. in my IFS training, it was remarked that when parts say that the result of them not doing their job properly would be some concrete external consequence, one should keep asking for “and what would be so bad about <em>that.'' </em>In other words, keeping asking until you get a concrete prediction of an <em>emotion</em> or <em>feeling</em> as a result; that’s the thing that the schema is <em>really</em> trying to avoid, <em>not</em> the ""objective"" consequence. When you get that prediction, then you can activate it and provide it with counterevidence from the fact that you are accessing it from Self, and thus not feeling that horrible after all. </p><p>Now, I <em>have </em>had IFS sessions which seemed to involve “playacting” and seemed to go along a strong narrative arc, which I can’t really put in any sensible memory reconsolidation terms. It still seemed to do <em>something</em>, but didn’t feel super-effective. Probably another approach would have been more efficient there. So I am not claiming that IFS is always the best way to approach things: it’s probably effective for some things and less effective for others. </p><ul><li><strong>""Developing self-leadership"" involves practicing a desired behavior so that it could override an old one; this is what Unlocking the Emotional Brain calls a counteractive strategy, and is fragile in all the ways that UtEB describes. It would be much more effective to just use a reconsolidation-based approach.</strong></li></ul><p>I wouldn't think of developing Self-leadership mostly as a counteractive strategy. It does have <em>some</em> counteractive components, such as learning to unblend when triggered. But that's mostly because any general strategy that you can use whenever you are triggered, <em>before </em>you have had a chance to use reconsolidative techniques or know enough about the schema in question to do it, has to necessarily be counteractive. </p><p>But the way I see it, the development of self-leadership is mainly reconsolidative as well. Take again UtEB's model where a schema contains both a problem description and a strategy for solving it. In my interpretation, “negotiating for Self-leadership” with a part is something you do when you have a grasp of the part’s (schema’s) strategy for solving a problem, but haven’t yet had the opportunity to dig into the underlying problem and associated memories. (Possibly because you only learned of this particular schema when you were triggered ten seconds ago, or because this is tricky in some other way.) In that situation, you apply reconsolidation to the <em>strategy</em> - basically showing the schema that <em>even if</em> it is responding to a valid problem, you can deal with it better if you are allowed to remain in Self.</p><p>E.g. here’s an excerpt from <em>Internal Family Systems Therapy </em>(1st ed.) describing a negotiation for Self-leadership; I’ve added comments in bold.</p><blockquote>I asked Nina to imagine that she was at the graveyard with her mother-in-law and to describe her thoughts and actions. She said that her mother-in-law was telling her stories about Tom between fits of sobbing. Superwoman <strong>[a part] </strong>had taken control of Nina and was giving the tearful woman platitudes, with barely concealed impatience and discomfort. She felt distant from her mother-in-law and knew that she was not being very helpful, but believed she had to rely on Superwoman to keep her from falling apart in that context. <strong>[Up until now, the procedure has been very similar to the Coherence Therapy example where Richard was asked to imagine being in a meeting and describe what he expected to happen. There’s a situation which triggers a part/schema, and associated feelings and responses. Of course, CT didn’t use the “part” terminology, but that doesn’t make the essential content of the exercise different.]</strong></blockquote><blockquote>I told Nina to talk with Superwoman and the other activated parts about letting her be her Self with her mother-in-law. They were to try not to interfere, and instead see how it went with Nina’s Self in the lead. The parts reluctantly agreed to watch instead of jumping in; Nina then imagined the scene at the cemetery again, but this time with the parts watching in the background instead of struggling to be in control. <strong>[Making your pre-existing implicit knowledge explicit by constructing a mental simulation which uses it; this technique featured in UtEB also.] </strong>Nina was amazed at how much more cooperative her parts were after she and they had done the internal work. </blockquote><blockquote>After a few minutes of silence, Nina reported that things had gone much better for both women. Nina and her mother-in-law had cried together, holding and stroking each other in commiseration. She felt closer than she ever had to the older woman, and was extremely relieved not to have to pretend to be so strong. <strong>[This makes for a juxtaposition experience: the prediction that Nina needs the Superwoman’s response to avoid falling apart, contrasted with the simulated result of actually being able to act better when in Self. As there is an update to the ""Superwoman"" schema's prediction that its strategy being activated will produce better results, it becomes less likely to trigger.] </strong>I asked Nina how her parts reacted to this; she said that they seemed impressed and surprised that it went so well, although Superwoman was still skeptical. Nina decided to try to repeat this experiment in vivo that week, and I wished her luck. [...]</blockquote><blockquote>At the <strong>[next] </strong>session, Nina proudly reported that her trip to the cemetery had unfolded almost as she had envisioned: She and her mother-in-law were able to cry together. She was also surprised at how nurturing her mother-in-law was able to be, once Nina gave her the chance. <strong>[after the strategy component of a schema has been successfully reconsolidated, the new behavior becomes effortless; if necessary, this can be used as additional evidence to further reconsolidate either the same schema or different ones]</strong></blockquote><p>IFS claims that as one does additional work, parts gradually “come to trust the Self” more, and it becomes easier to get parts to grant Self-leadership. My guess is that this is because you accumulate more and more evidence of it actually being a good idea to act out of Self, rather than from a triggered state. That will make it easier to find evidence to present to any schema which suggests acting otherwise.</p><p>Earlier pjeby said:</p><blockquote>It's far more efficient to delete the rules that trigger conflicting behavior before you try to learn self-leadership, so that you aren't fighting your reinforced behaviors to do so.</blockquote><p>And this is in fact also recommended in IFS; from the same discussion that I was quoting before:</p><blockquote>Nina was amazed at how much more cooperative her parts were after she and they had done the internal work. [...] I find that this kind of in-sight (which I call the “Self-confidence technique”) is often useful for helping a client’s parts see that they can trust the Self. When parts let the Self lead in external situations, those situations are inevitably handled better than when a part leads. If parts refuse to allow the Self to lead, then their fears can be explored and addressed until they are willing to temporarily cede control to the Self.</blockquote><p>In other words, if you can’t get Self-leadership to work, then dig into your schemas, see what they predict would go wrong, and do reconsolidation until it comes naturally.</p><ul><li><strong>IFS makes it hard to surface the assumptions behind behavior, because one is stuck in the frame of negotiating with mini-people inside one's head, rather than looking at the underlying memories and assumptions. Possibly an experienced IFS therapist can help look for those assumptions, but then one might as well use a non-parts-based framework.</strong></li><li><strong>Even when the therapist does know what to look for, the fact that IFS does not have a direct model of evidence and counterevidence makes it hard to find the interventions which will actually trigger reconsolidation. Rather one just acts out various behaviors which may trigger reconsolidation if they happen to hit the right pattern.</strong></li></ul><p>As I’ve noted, I feel like IFS is already <em>all about</em> looking at the underlying memories and assumptions. This is certainly what my IFS training emphasized: keep asking questions which will reveal the assumptions of the protectors, and take you to those exiles. The ""UI"" of the parts is used as an experiental / felt sense handle that leads back to the core of the schema.</p><p>It’s true that one might use a different framework as well, and sometimes that may have its benefits. But what makes IFS unique, I think, is that you don’t <em>need</em> to understand all the underlying assumptions of the schema: whatever they are, they bottom out at “and then I would feel terrible”, and if you can get to Self, you can just reconsolidate <em>that</em> assumption directly. And framing things in terms of parts seems to be useful in getting the person into Self, by asking parts to move aside.</p><ul><li><strong>Besides the issue with luck, IFS does not really have the concept of a schema which keeps interpreting behaviors in the light of its existing model, and thus filtering out all the counter-evidence that the playacting might otherwise have contained. A skilled IFS therapist who was paying attention might notice this happening and deal with it, but such a good therapist could probably get results with any therapy model that gave them sufficient freedom to notice and address the issue.</strong></li></ul><p>To finish this post off on an agreeable note: here I’m actually somewhat inclined to agree with pjeby. IFS as it’s taught <em>does</em> have something like this concept: it’s referred to as a “Self-like part”, i.e. a part which believes itself to be Self and tries to go through the motions of Self, but doesn’t actually get any real healing done. But even though IFS does have this concept, I’m not convinced it has very good tools for dealing with it. The main one that I heard of was just to insist that the part in question is not actually Self, and match the therapist’s conviction and reassurance against the part’s, until it moves aside and gives you access to the real Self. But I’m not sure of what one is supposed to do if that doesn’t work.</p><p><em>Thanks to Maija Haavisto for comments on drafts of this article.</em></p>",Kaj_Sotala,kaj_sotala,Kaj_Sotala,

(In my mind I tend to think of these as ""researchers"" and ""engineers"", respectively, but I think MIRI calls both of these classes of people ""researchers"" these days so I want to avoid using ""researcher"".) Basically I count anyone who has published a paper or post in agent foundations as a mathematician, and everyone else as an engineer. From the current <a href=""https://intelligence.org/team/"">team page</a>, I would classify Nate, Eliezer, Benya, Scott, Sam, Abram, and Tsvi as ""MIRI mathematician"", and Jesse, Nick, Buck, Ben, James, and Edward as ""MIRI engineer"". I don't actually know if this is a reasonable classification given that MIRI's recent work isn't public.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, MIRI has not made any new mathematician hires since mid-2017; see <a href=""https://aiwatch.issarice.com/?organization=Machine+Intelligence+Research+Institute#full-history-of-additions-and-subtractions"">this table</a> which I made, and <a href=""https://intelligence.org/2017/07/04/updates-to-the-research-team-and-a-major-donation/"">this blog post</a> which I believe is the last hiring update for mathematicians.</p>
<p>Assuming there are no unannounced hires, the lack of hires can be for two broad reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>A change in the demand: less need for new people, more selective about who to hire, etc.</li>
<li>A change in the supply: fewer people to pick from, drop in quality of people that come into contact, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think both changes have probably happened, although my guess would be that with the takeoff of the AI safety field, there are now more people to pick from, so the lack of hires is mostly due to a change in the demand.</p>
<p>One way I've been thinking about these changes is to consider the same person attempting to work at MIRI as a mathematician in 2013 vs 2019. In particular, I've been thinking about <a href=""https://aiwatch.issarice.com/?person=Nate+Soares"">Nate Soares</a>, who was hired as a research fellow in 2014. To give my own summary, Nate was a full-time Google engineer who had taken multi-variable calculus and real analysis in college (in addition to the mathematics appearing in his CS degree), but otherwise with no experience learning or doing research in math. He discovered LessWrong probably in early or mid 2013, and came around to MIRI's worldviews by July 2013. He then spent five months (August to December) learning basic category theory, set theory, model theory, computability and logic, and provability logic, then attended a MIRI workshop, studied some more math, and joined MIRI as a research associate (January 2014) and then as a research fellow (April 2014). Nate might be an outlier in his studying/research abilities, so might be a bad example to use here, but he is the most transparent example, having blogged about his experiences. See <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/uX3HjXo6BWos3Zgy5/the-mechanics-of-my-recent-productivity"">The mechanics of my recent productivity</a>, <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/F2DZXsMdhGyX4FPAd/on-saving-the-world"">On saving the world</a>, and his other LessWrong posts for more information.</p>
<p>I am wondering what the corresponding trajectory would look like for a Nate Soares who discovered LessWrong in 2019. (This version of Nate would be six years younger. Also discovering LessWrong later means a lower quality person in expectation, even adjusting for age, so we can imagine something magically prevented him from discovering it.) Would he have been hired? If so, how long would it have taken him? If not, what would have happened to him?</p>
<p>I've brainstormed some potential differences between 2013 and 2019. Note that I'm not saying these are the only reasons or that I think any particular reason listed is likely (I'm asking this question because I'm not sure what's actually the case).</p>
<ul>
<li>Takeoff of the field in general (see <a href=""https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_AI_safety"">Timeline of AI safety</a>, <a href=""https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_OpenAI"">Timeline of OpenAI</a>, <a href=""https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_Machine_Intelligence_Research_Institute"">Timeline of MIRI</a>, <a href=""https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_Future_of_Humanity_Institute"">Timeline of FHI</a>, and <a href=""https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_Center_for_Human-Compatible_AI"">Timeline of CHAI</a> for some relevant dates)
<ul>
<li>Now there are more AI safety organizations, who could be competing for new talent. In other words, a 2019 version of Nate could be hired by OpenAI instead of MIRI.</li>
<li>More people interested in entering the field. I think this would mean more hires, so doesn't explain the lack of hires.</li>
<li>Position of MIRI relative to the AI safety field. In 2013 MIRI represented the AI safety field as a whole, but in 2019 MIRI represents a particular view within AI safety. There are now more filters for a potential hire, where they must not only agree with AI safety as a cause area, but also with MIRI's specific positions within that cause area.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Less openness at MIRI (e.g. nondisclosed-by-default policy, fewer MIRI people who are active on public forums). A 2019 version of Nate would have a harder time learning about and contributing to the cutting edge of MIRI research, and interacting with MIRI researchers.</li>
<li>Emergence of MIRI's <a href=""https://intelligence.org/2018/11/22/2018-update-our-new-research-directions/#section1"">new research directions</a>. This might mean MIRI is more focused on hiring engineers, so a 2019 version of Nate might have become an engineer at MIRI instead of a mathematician.</li>
<li>Lack of MIRI workshops (I've heard the growing size of MIRI's research team as a reason for this, i.e. workshops are less necessary because there are more people already at MIRI to bounce ideas off of). A 2019 version of Nate wouldn't be able to attend a workshop, unlike the 2013 version.</li>
<li>Emergence of programs like MSFP, internships, AIRCS, and <a href=""https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/global-catastrophic-risks/potential-risks-advanced-artificial-intelligence/machine-intelligence-research-institute-ai-safety-retraining-program"">retraining project</a>. MSFP in particular seems to serve a similar recruiting function for mathematicians as workshops, but I'm not clear on the differences from a hiring viewpoint.</li>
<li>Bigger research team at MIRI. Maybe the ""basic research positions"" at MIRI have been filled, so MIRI can be more selective about the expertise new hires have, or their level of capability. Another idea is that MIRI research is not very parallelizable, so the value of the marginal hire goes down quickly as a function of number of researchers.</li>
<li>Funding. MIRI seems to have way more funding now, so this doesn't explain the lack of hires.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am interested in thoughts on the specific questions I've raised, thoughts on which of the reasons brainstormed above are most likely, and any other thoughts people have on MIRI hiring practices in 2013 vs 2019.</p>

and the Race to Save the World, by <a href=""https://tomchivers.com/"">Tom
Chivers</a>.</p>
<p>This book is a sympathetic portrayal of the rationalist movement by a
quasi-outsider. It includes a well-organized explanation of why some
people expect tha AI will create large risks sometime this century,
written in simple language that is suitable for a broad audience.</p>
<p>Caveat: I know many of the people who are described in the book. I've
had some sort of connection with the rationalist movement since before
it became distinct from transhumanism, and I've been mostly an insider
since 2012. I read this book mainly because I was interested in how the
rationalist movement looks to outsiders.</p>
<p>Chivers is a science writer. I normally avoid books by science writers,
due to an impression that they mostly focus on telling interesting
stories, without developing a deep understanding of the topics they
write about.</p>
<p>Chivers' understanding of the rationalist movement doesn't quite qualify
as deep, but he was surprisingly careful to read a lot about the
subject, and to write only things he did understand.</p>
<p>Many times I reacted to something he wrote with ""that's close, but not
quite right"". Usually when I reacted that way, Chivers did a good job of
describing the the rationalist message in question, and the main problem
was either that rationalists haven't figured out how to explain their
ideas in a way that a board audience can understand, or that
rationalists are confused. So the complaints I make in the rest of this
review are at most weakly directed in Chivers direction.</p>
<p>I saw two areas where Chivers overlooked something important.</p>
<h3>Rationality</h3>
<p>One involves <a href=""http://rationality.org"">CFAR</a>.</p>
<p>Chivers wrote seven chapters on biases, and how rationalists view them,
ending with ""the most important bias"": <em>knowing about biases can make
you more biased.</em> (italics his).</p>
<p>I get the impression that Chivers is sweeping this problem under the rug
(Do we fight that bias by being aware of it? Didn't we just read that
that doesn't work?). That is roughly what happened with many people who
learned rationalism solely via written descriptions.</p>
<p>Then much later, when describing how he handled his conflicting
attitudes toward the risks from AI, he gives a really great description
of maybe 3% of what CFAR teaches (internal double crux), much like a
blind man giving a really clear description of the upper half of an
elephant's trunk. He prefaces this narrative with the apt warning: ""I am
aware that this all sounds a bit mystical and self-helpy. It's not.""</p>
<p>Chivers doesn't seem to connect this exercise with the goal of
overcoming biases. Maybe he was too busy applying the technique on an
important problem to notice the connection with his prior discussions of
Bayes, biases, and sanity. It would be reasonable for him to argue that
CFAR's ideas have diverged enough to belong in a separate category, but
he seems to put them in a different category by accident, without
realizing that many of us consider CFAR to be an important continuation
of rationalists' interest in biases.</p>
<h3>World conquest</h3>
<p>Chivers comes very close to covering all of the layman-accessible claims
that Yudkowsky and Bostrom make. My one complaint here is that he only
give vague hints about why one bad AI can't be stopped by other AI's.</p>
<p>A key claim of many leading rationalists is that AI will have some
winner take all dynamics that will lead to one AI having a decisive
strategic advantage after it crosses some key threshold, such as
human-level intelligence.</p>
<p>This is a controversial position that is somewhat connected to <a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/AI_takeoff#Hard_takeoff"">foom
(fast
takeoff)</a>, but
which might be correct even <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/PKy8NuNPknenkDY74/soft-takeoff-can-still-lead-to-decisive-strategic-advantage"">without
foom</a>.</p>
<h3>Utility functions</h3>
<p>""If I stop caring about chess, that won't help me win any chess games,
now will it?"" - That chapter title provides a good explanation of why a
simple AI would continue caring about its most fundamental goals.</p>
<p>Is that also true of an AI with more complex, human-like goals? Chivers
is partly successful at explaining how to apply the concept of a utility
function to a human-like intelligence. Rationalists (or at least those
who actively research AI safety) have a clear meaning here, at least as
applied to agents that can be modeled mathematically. But when laymen
try to apply that to humans, confusion abounds, due to the ease of
conflating subgoals with ultimate goals.</p>
<p>Chivers tries to clarify, using the story of Odysseus and the Sirens,
and claims that the Sirens would rewrite Odysseus' utility function. I'm
not sure how we can verify that the Sirens work that way, or whether
they would merely persuade Odysseus to make false predictions about his
expected utility. Chivers at least states clearly that the Sirens try to
prevent Odysseus (by making him run aground) from doing what his
pre-Siren utility function advises. Chivers' point could be a bit
clearer if he specified that in his (nonstandard?) version of the story,
the Sirens make Odysseus want to run aground.</p>
<h3>Philosophy</h3>
<p>""Essentially, he [Yudkowsky] (and the Rationalists) are thoroughgoing
utilitarians."" - That's a bit misleading. Leading rationalists are
predominantly consequentialists, but mostly avoid committing to a moral
system as specific as utilitarianism. Leading rationalists also mostly
endorse <a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Moral_uncertainty"">moral
uncertainty</a>.
Rationalists mostly endorse utilitarian-style calculation (which entails
some of the controversial features of utilitarianism), but are careful
to combine that with worry about whether we're optimizing the quantity
that we want to optimize.</p>
<p>I also recommend <a href=""https://thinkingcomplete.blogspot.com/2017/10/utilitarianism-and-its-discontents.html"">Utilitarianism and its
discontents</a>
as an example of one rationalist's nuanced partial endorsement of
utilitarianism.</p>
<h3>Political solutions to AI risk?</h3>
<p>Chivers describes <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holden_Karnofsky"">Holden
Karnofsky</a> as wanting
""to get governments and tech companies to sign treaties saying they'll
submit any AGI designs to outside scrutiny before switching them on. It
wouldn't be iron-clad, because firms might simply lie"".</p>
<p>Most rationalists seem pessimistic about treaties such as this.</p>
<p>Lying is hardly the only problem. This idea assumes that there will be a
tiny number of attempts, each with a very small number of launches that
look like the real thing, as happened with the first moon landing and
the first atomic bomb. Yet the history of software development suggests
it will be something more like hundreds of attempts that look like they
might succeed. I wouldn't be surprised if there are millions of times
when an AI is turned on, and the developer has some hope that this time
it will grow into a human-level AGI. There's no way that a large number
of designs will get sufficient outside scrutiny to be of much use.</p>
<p>And if a developer is trying new versions of their system once a day
(e.g. making small changes to a number that controls, say, openness to
new experience), any requirement to submit all new versions for outside
scrutiny would cause large delays, creating large incentives to subvert
the requirement.</p>
<p>So any realistic treaty would need provisions that identify a relatively
small set of design choices that need to be scrutinized.</p>
<p>I see few signs that any experts are close to developing a consensus
about what criteria would be appropriate here, and I expect that doing
so would require a significant fraction of the total wisdom needed for
AI safety. I discussed my hope for one such criterion in <a href=""http://www.bayesianinvestor.com/blog/index.php/2019/01/30/drexler-on-ai-risk/"">my
review</a>
of Drexler's <a href=""https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/reframing/"">Reframing Superintelligence
paper</a>.</p>
<h3>Rationalist personalities</h3>
<p>Chivers mentions several plausible explanations for what he labels the
""semi-death of LessWrong"", the most obvious being that Eliezer Yudkowsky
finished most of the blogging that he had wanted to do there. But I'm
puzzled by one explanation that Chivers reports: ""the attitude ... of
thinking they can rebuild everything"". Quoting Robin Hanson:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At Xanadu they had to do everything different: they had to organize
their meetings differently and orient their screens differently and
hire a different kind of manager, everything had to be different
because they were creative types and full of themselves. And that's
the kind of people who started the Rationalists.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That seems like a partly apt explanation for the demise of the
rationalist startups MetaMed and Arbital. But LessWrong mostly copied
existing sites, such as Reddit, and was only ambitious in the sense that
Eliezer was ambitious about what ideas to communicate.</p>
<h3>Culture</h3>
<p>I guess a book about rationalists can't resist mentioning polyamory.
""For instance, for a lot of people it would be difficult not to be
jealous."" Yes, when I lived in a mostly monogamous culture, jealousy
seemed pretty standard. That attititude melted away when the bay area
cultures that I associated with started adopting polyamory or something
similar (shortly before the rationalists became a culture). Jealousy has
much more purpose if my partner is flirting with monogamous people than
if he's flirting with polyamorists.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Less dramatically, We all know people who are afraid of visiting their
city centres because of terrorist attacks, but don't think twice about
driving to work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This suggests some weird filter bubbles somewhere. I thought that fear
of cities got forgotten within a month or so after 9/11. Is this a
difference between London and the US? Am I out of touch with popular
concerns? Does Chivers associate more with paranoid people than I do? I
don't see any obvious answer.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>It would be really nice if Chivers and Yudkowsky could team up to write
a book, but this book is a close substitute for such a collaboration.</p>

It seems to me like there are tons of $20 bills <a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/06/19/money-on-the-ground/"">lying on the ground</a> which no one picks up.</p><p>For example, we know that people <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28470036"">systematically choose</a> unattractive images for their dating profiles. Sites like <a href=""https://www.photofeeler.com/"">PhotoFeeler</a> cheaply (in some cases, freely) resolve this problem. Since photo quality is <a href=""http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11129-010-9088-6"">one of the strongest predictors</a> of number of matches, you would think people would be clamoring to use these sites. And yet, <a href=""https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/photofeeler.com"">not many people use them</a>. </p><p>In the off-line dating world, it surprises me how few self-help books are about dating. Right now, zero of the <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Best-Sellers-Books-Self-Help/zgbs/books/4736"">top 10 Amazon best-selling self-help books</a> are about dating. I see only two dating books in the top 50: <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Love-Languages-Secret-that-Lasts/dp/080241270X/"">The 5 Love Languages</a> and <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Super-Attractor-Methods-Manifesting-Wildest/dp/B07SGGBHS4"">Super Attractor</a>. To the extent these books exist, they often have little to no empirical support; my guess is that horoscopes are the most frequently read source of dating advice. Evidence-based books like <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Mate-Become-Man-Women-Want-ebook/dp/B00RTY0FKK"">Mate</a> are less widely read.</p><h2>Possible Solution #1: Inadequate Equilibria</h2><p>It might be that we are in an <a href=""https://equilibriabook.com/"">Inadequate Equilibrium</a>. Eliezer proposes three general ways in which seeming inefficiencies can exist:</p><p><em>1. Cases where the decision lies in the hands of people who would gain little personally, or lose out personally, if they did what was necessary to help someone else;</em></p><p>This doesn&#x2019;t seem very compelling in the case of online dating. Anyone could choose to use PhotoFeeler for themselves, for example.</p><p><em>2. Cases where decision-makers can&#x2019;t reliably learn the information they need to make decisions, even though someone else has that information</em></p><p>Again, this isn&#x2019;t compelling. PhotoFeeler clearly lets you know what other people think of your photos.</p><p><em>3. Systems that are broken in multiple places so that no one actor can make them better, even though, in principle, some magically coordinated action could move to a new stable state.</em></p><p>Regressions done by <a href=""http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11129-010-9088-6"">Hitsch et al</a>., as well as common sense, indicate that improving your own photos, even if you do nothing else or nothing else changes about the world, does make a significant impact in your likelihood of finding a good partner. So again, this seems uncompelling.</p><h2>Possible Solution #2: Free Energy</h2><blockquote>I&#x2019;ve seen a number of novice rationalists committing what I shall term the Free Energy Fallacy, which is something along the lines of, &#x201C;This system&#x2019;s purpose is supposed to be to cook omelettes, and yet it produces terrible omelettes. So why don&#x2019;t I use my amazing skills to cook some better omelettes and take over?&#x201D;</blockquote><blockquote>And generally the answer is that maybe the system from your perspective is broken, but everyone within the system is intensely competing along other dimensions and you can&#x2019;t keep up with that competition. They&#x2019;re all chasing whatever things people in that system actually pursue&#x2014;instead of the lost purposes they wistfully remember, but don&#x2019;t have a chance to pursue because it would be career suicide. You won&#x2019;t become competitive along those dimensions just by cooking better omelettes. &#x2013; <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yPLr2tnXbiFXkMWvk/an-equilibrium-of-no-free-energy#targetText=I&apos;ve%20seen%20a%20number,yet%20it%20produces%20terrible%20omelettes.&amp;targetText=You%20won&apos;t%20become%20competitive,just%20by%20cooking%20better%20omelettes."">An Equilibrium of No Free Energy</a></blockquote><p>It&#x2019;s possible that people don&#x2019;t actually want to find good mates. Maybe they just want to <em>seem as though</em> they are trying to find good mates, or something. This would be consistent with dating advice being so evidence-free: people really want to signal that they care about finding good mate (which they can do by leaving a copy of Cosmo conspicuously out on their coffee table), but don&#x2019;t actually care about finding a good mate (so they don&#x2019;t care if Cosmo actually has good advice).</p><p>I&#x2019;m pretty skeptical of this. If I was forced to guess only one thing that humans actually, really, really really really, valued as a terminal goal, &#x201C;find a good mate&#x201D; would be pretty high on my list of guesses. It&#x2019;s the thing we have millions of years of evolutionary pressure towards prioritizing. I might even go so far as to suggest that all the other markets which are efficient are efficient largely because of people&#x2019;s desire for romantic success: quants find arbitrage opportunities in the stock market because they hope that this financial success will translate into romantic success, etc.</p><p>So why is it that people &#x2013; including people who devote their lives to finding arbitrage opportunities &#x2013; leave so many metaphorical $20 bills on the ground when they start dating?</p><p>I remain confused.</p>",Xodarap,xodarap,Xodarap,

I recently read a 

<a href=""https://blog.simpleanalytics.com/why-we-moved-our-servers-to-iceland"">blog
post on locating servers in Iceland</a> that included:



</p><p>

</p>

<blockquote>
If you draw a straight line from San Francisco to Amsterdam you will
cross Iceland. [We have the] most customers from the US and Europe, so
it makes sense to pick this geographical location.
</blockquote>



<p>

I don't want to pick on them in particular, but this is a common
misconception about how the internet works.  Internet traffic doesn't
follow <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_circle"">great-circle</a>
routes, but instead follows the cables. [1]  In the case of connections
between the US, Iceland, and Europe, these are <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submarine_communications_cable"">underwater
cables</a>:

</p>

<p>

<a href=""https://www.submarinecablemap.com/""><img src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/2ALjPEQwkN8YiaW2Z/hqfhp43hgp6bz0xhr4cm""></a>

</p>

<p>

This is only a diagram, and doesn't show exact routes, but you can see
that Iceland has much better connectivity to the East than the West.
A packet from the US to Iceland is probably going to first cross the
Atlantic to mainland Europe, and then backtrack.

</p>

<p>

Running a traceroute from my RCN connection in Boston, this is what's
happening.  I see packets going via
hge0-2-0-0.border1.<b>bos.ma</b>.rcn.net, then
10-2-3.bear2.<b>boston1</b>.level3.net, then
ae-2-3205.edge3.<b>amsterdam1</b>.level3.net, on their way to
185.112.146.187, an IP in Iceland.

</p>

<p>

We can also see this with ping times:

</p>

<ul>
<li>Paris to Iceland: 52ms</li>
<li>Boston to Paris: 108ms</li>
<li>Boston to Iceland: 136ms</li>
</ul>



<p>

If you want to place a server ""close"" to both the US and Europe,
trying to split the difference and put it in Iceland is worse than
just putting it in Europe.

</p>

<p>

(Separately, it's also not helpful to think of a domain as having to be
hosted from only one place.  You can configure DNS so the domain will
resolve to different IP addresses in different parts of the world, and
you can handle user requests as closer to the user as possible.
Requests like ""please give me script.js"" or ""please record
that someone visited example.com"" can easily be handled by
multiple servers around the world.)

</p>

<p>
<br>

[1] This isn't completely true: there are non-cable links, but cables
carry the vast majority of internet traffic.

<p>I will walk through a series of arguments that suggest that this claim is true, and then flesh out the picture towards the end.</p>
<p>(note: I discovered after writing this post that my argument is similar to&nbsp;<a href=""https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/the-normative-web-an-argument-for-moral-realism/"">Cuneo's</a>&nbsp;argument for moral realism; I present it anyway in the hope that it is additionally insightful)</p>
<h2>Epistemic virtue</h2>
<p>There are epistemic virtues, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Try to have correct beliefs.</li>
<li>When you're not sure about something, see if there's a cheap way to test it.</li>
<li>Learn to distinguish between cases where you (or someone else) is rationalizing, versus when you/they are offering actual reasons for belief.</li>
<li>Notice logical inconsistencies in your beliefs and reflect on them.</li>
<li>Try to make your high-level beliefs accurately summarize low-level facts.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are all phrased as commands, which are a type of ought claim. Yet, they all assist one following such commands to have more accurate beliefs.</p>
<p>Indeed, it is hard to imagine how someone who does not (explicitly or implicitly) follow rules like these could come to have accurate beliefs. There are many ways to end up in lala land, and guidelines are essential for staying on the path.</p>
<p>So, ""is"" claims that rely on the speaker of the claim having epistemic virtue to be taken seriously, rely on the ""ought"" claims of epistemic virtue itself.</p>
<h2>Functionalist theory of mind</h2>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/functionalism/#targetText=Functionalism%20in%20the%20philosophy%20of,which%20it%20is%20a%20part."">functionalist theory of mind</a>&nbsp;is ""the doctrine that what makes something a mental state of a particular type does not depend on its internal constitution, but rather on the way it functions, or the role it plays, in the system of which it is a part."" For example, according to functionalism, for myself to have a world-representing mind, part of my brain must be performing the function of representing the world.</p>
<p>I will not here argue for the functionalist theory of mind, and instead will assume it to be true.</p>
<p>Consider the following ""is"" claim: ""There is a plate on my desk.""</p>
<p>I believe this claim to be true. But why? I see a plate on my desk. But what does that mean?</p>
<p>Phenomenologically, I have the sense that there is a round object on my desk, and that this object is a plate. But it seems that we are now going in a loop.</p>
<p>Here's an attempt at a way out. ""My visual system functions to present me with accurate information about the objects around me. I believe it to be functioning well. And I believe my phenomenological sense of there being a plate on my desk to be from my visual system. Therefore, there is a plate on my desk.""</p>
<p>Well, this certainly relies on a claim of ""function"". That's not an ""ought"" claim about me, but it is similar (and perhaps identical) to an ""ought"" claim about my visual system: that presenting me with information about objects is what my visual system ought to do.</p>
<p>Things get hairy when examining the second sentence. ""I believe it to be functioning well."" Why do I believe that?</p>
<p>I can consider evidence like ""my visual system, along with my other sensory modalities, presents me with a coherent world that has few anomalies."" That's a complex claim, and checking it requires things like checking my memories of how coherent the world my senses present to me is, which is again relying on the parts of my mind to perform their functions.</p>
<p>I can't doubt my mind except by using my mind. And using my mind requires, at least tentatively, accepting claims like ""my visual system is there&nbsp;<em>for</em>&nbsp;presenting me with accurate information about the objects around me.""</p>
<p>Indeed, even making sense of a claim such as ""there is a plate on my desk"" requires me to use some intuition-reliant faculty I have of mapping words to concepts; without trust in such a faculty, the claim is meaningless.</p>
<p>I, therefore, cannot make meaningful ""is"" claims without at the same time using at least some parts of my mind as tools, applying ""ought"" claims to them.</p>
<h2>Social systems</h2>
<p>Social systems, such as legal systems, academic disciplines, and religions, contain ""ought"" claims. Witnesses&nbsp;<em>ought</em> to be allowed to say what they saw. Judges&nbsp;<em>ought</em> to weigh the evidence presented. People&nbsp;<em>ought</em> not to murder each other. Mathematical proofs&nbsp;<em>ought</em> to be checked by peers before being published.</p>
<p>Many such oughts are essential for the system's epistemology. If the norms of mathematics do not include ""check proofs for accuracy"" and so on, then there is little reason to believe the mathematical discipline's ""is"" claims such as ""Fermat's last theorem is true.""</p>
<p>Indeed, it is hard for claims such as ""Fermat's last theorem is true"" to even be&nbsp;<em>meaningful</em> without oughts. For, there are oughts involved in interpreting mathematical notation, and in resolving verbal references to theorems. Such as, ""the&nbsp;<em>true</em> meaning of '+' is integer addition, which can be computed using the following algorithm.""</p>
<p>Without mathematical ""ought""s, ""Fermat's last theorem is true"" isn't just a doubtful claim, it's a&nbsp;<em>meaningless</em> one, which is&nbsp;<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_even_wrong"">not even wrong</a>.</p>
<p>Language itself can be considered as a social system. When people misuse language (such as by lying), their statements cannot be taken seriously, and sometimes can't even be interpreted as having meaning.</p>
<p>(A possible interpretation of Baudrillard's&nbsp;<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulacra_and_Simulation"">simulacrum theory</a>&nbsp;is that level 1 is when there are sufficient ""ought""s both to interpret claims and to ensure that they are true for the most part; level 2 is when there are sufficient ""ought""s to meaningfully interpret claims but not to ensure that they are true; level 3 is when ""ought""s are neither sufficient to interpret claims nor to ensure that they are true, but are sufficient for claims to superficially look like meaningful ones; and level 4 is where ""ought""s are not even sufficient to ensure that claims superficially look meaningful.)</p>
<h2>Nondualist epistemology</h2>
<p>One might say to the arguments so far:</p>
<p>""Well, certainly, my own 'is' claims require some entities, each of which may be a past iteration of myself, a part of my mind, or another person, to be following oughts, in order for my claims be meaningful and/or correct. But, perhaps such oughts do not apply to me, myself, here and now.""</p>
<p>However, such a self/other separation is untenable.</p>
<p>Suppose I am a mathematical professor, who is considering performing academic fraud, to ensure that false theorems end up in journals. If I corrupt the mathematical process, then I cannot, in the future, rely on the claims of mathematical journals to be true. Additionally, if others are behaving similarly to me, then my own decision to corrupt the process is evidence that others also decide to corrupt the process. Some of these others are in the past; my own decision to corrupt the process is evidence that my own mathematical knowledge is false, as it is evidence that those before me have decided similarly. So, my own mathematical ""is"" claims rely on myself following mathematical ""ought"" claims.</p>
<p>(More precisely, both&nbsp;<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidential_decision_theory#targetText=Evidential%20decision%20theory%20is%20a,best%20expectations%20for%20the%20outcome."">evidential decision theory</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05060#targetText=Functional%20decision%20theorists%20hold%20that,would%20yield%20the%20best%20outcome%3F%22"">functional decision theory</a>&nbsp;have a notion by which present decisions can have past consequences, including past consequences affecting the accuracy of presently-available information)</p>
<p>Indeed, the idea of corrupting the mathematical process would be horrific to most good mathematicians, in a quasi-religious way. These mathematicians' own ability to take their work seriously enough to attain rigor depends on such a quasi-religious respect for the mathematical discipline.</p>
<p>Nondualist epistemology cannot rely on a self/other boundary by which decisions made in the present moment have no effects on the information available in the present moment. Lying to similar agents, thus, undermines both the meaningfulness and the truth of one's own beliefs.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I will summarize the argument thusly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each ""is"" claim may or may not be justified.</li>
<li>An ""is"" claim is only justified if the system producing the claim is functioning well at the epistemology of this claim.</li>
<li>Specifically, an ""is"" claim that you make is justified only if some system you are part of is functioning well at the epistemology of that claim. (You are the one making the claim, after all, so the system must include the you who makes the claim)</li>
<li>That system (that you are part of) can only function well at the epistemology of that claim if you have some function in that system and you perform that function satisfactorily. (Functions of wholes depend on functions of parts; even if all you do is listen for a claim and repeat it, that is a function)</li>
<li>Therefore, an ""is"" claim that you make is justified only if you have some specific function and you expect to perform that function satisfactorily.</li>
<li>If a reasonable agent expects itself to perform some function satisfactorily, then according to that agent, that agent ought to perform that function satisfactorily.</li>
<li>Therefore, if you are a reasonable agent who accepts the argument so far, you believe that your ""is"" claims are only justified if you have oughts.</li>
</ul>
<p>The second-to-last point is somewhat subtle. If I use a fork as a tool, then I am applying an ""ought"" to the fork; I expect it ought to function as an eating utensil. Similar to using another person as a tool (alternatively ""employee"" or ""service worker""), giving them commands and expecting that they ought to follow them. If my own judgments functionally depend on myself performing some function, then I am using myself as a tool (expecting myself to perform that function). To avoid self-inconsistency between myself-the-tool-user and myself-the-tool, I must accept an ought, which is that I ought to satisfactorily perform the tool-function I am expecting myself to perform; if I do not accept that ought, I must drop any judgment whose justification requires me to perform the function generating this ought.</p>
<p>It is possible to make a similar argument about meaningfulness; the key point is that the meaningfulness of a claim depends on the functioning of an interpretive system that this claim is part of. To fail to follow the oughts implied by the meaningfulness of ones' statements is not just to be wrong, but to collapse into incoherence.</p>
<p>Certainly, this argument does not imply that all ""ought""s can be derived from ""is""es. In particular, an agent may have degrees of freedom in how it performs its functions satisfactorily, or in doing things orthogonal to performing its functions. What the argument suggests instead is that each ""is"" depends on at least one ""ought"", which itself may depend on an ""is"", in a giant web of interdependence.</p>
<p>There are multiple possible interdependent webs (multiple possible mind designs, multiple possible social systems), such that a different web could have instead come in to existence, and our own web may evolve into any one of a number of future possibilities. Though, we can only reason about hypothetical webs from our own actual one.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is difficult to conceive of what it would mean for the oughts being considered to be ""objective""; indeed, an implication of the argument is that objectivity itself depends on oughts, at least some of which must be pre-objective or simultaneous with objectivity.</p>
<p>Related, at least some of those oughts that are necessary as part of the constitution of ""is"", must themselves be pre-""is"" or simultaneous with ""is"", and thus must not themselves depend on already-constituted ""is""es. A possible candidate for such an ought is: ""organize!"" For the world to produce a map without already containing one, it must organize itself into a self-representing structure, from a position of not already being self-representing. (Of course, here I am referring to the denotation of ""organize!"", which is a kind of directed motion, rather than to the text ""organize!""; the text cannot itself have effective power outside the context of a text-interpretation system)</p>
<p>One can, of course, sacrifice epistemology, choosing to lie and to confuse one's self, in ways that undermine both the truth and meaningfulness of one's own ""is"" claims.</p>
<p>But, due to the anthropic principle, we (to be a coherent ""we"" that can reason) are instead at an intermediate point of a process that does&nbsp;<em>not</em> habitually make such decisions, or one which tends to correct them. A process that made such decisions without correcting them would result in rubble, not reason. (And whether our own process results in rubble or reason in the future is, in part, up to us, as we are part of this process)</p>
<p>And so, when we are a we that can reason, we accept at least those oughts that our own reason depends on, while acknowledging the existence of non-reasoning processes that do not.</p>

<p>Do you feel sleepy enough during the day that it impairs your ability to function? Do you fall asleep involuntarily during the day? Do you feel tired enough that you feel weak, have difficulty doing things, or feel unable to focus?</p>
<p>If you answered yes to any of these questions, here’s a set of guidelines to help you figure out what’s worth trying. I go over generally applicable advice for daytime sleepiness and fatigue, then cover signs that would indicate more rare causes you can investigate. If feeling tired is significantly impairing your productivity, the information value of trying these experiments is probably well worthwhile.</p>
<p>This infographic checks for the most common causes of fatigue and what you should do it for each. These common causes account for the majority of people with daytime sleepiness, so there’s a good chance they cover the most relevant information for you. If you’ve already read a bunch about sleep, you’ll find loads more detail in the eleven pages of research that follow.</p>
<p><img src=""https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5ad8da815ffd20813824d475/t/5db620305d3ce536b6b0acfa/1572216904742/Sleep+Decision+Tree.png?format=1500w"" alt=""""></p>
<p>_This guide was heavily influenced by <a href=""http://UpToDate.com"">UpToDate.com</a>, an evidence-based clinical resource, and interviews with medical professionals. But, just so we’re clear, I’m not a medical professional and these suggestions aren’t medical advice. Listen to the person who actually went to medical school if they give you different advice.&nbsp;_</p>
<h2><strong>1.  Are you fatigued?</strong></h2>
<p>If you can fall asleep during the day in less than 8 minutes, you're probably sleep-deprived and may have a sleep disorder. You might have fatigue (or excessive daytime sleepiness) if:</p>
<ul>
<li>You feel sleepy enough during the day that it impairs your ability to function, or you fall asleep involuntarily during the day.</li>
<li>You feel tired enough that you feel weak, have difficulty doing things, or can’t focus because you're tired.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you experience the above more than once a week or have some weeks where you’re just tired the whole time, it’s probably worthwhile for you to spend time trying to solve the issue. (It’s probably not fatigue if you just feel tired right after a trip when jet-lagged, or if you had to pull an all-nighter.)</p>
<p>What works to make you feel well-rested will probably be different from others, particularly people who always feel rested by default. So, you can approach your sleep as a hits-based experiment. It might take you some trial and error to find what works for you, but one big win justifies a lot of little experiments. So if sleep is a big problem, the information value of trying these experiments is quite high.</p>
<h2><strong>2.  Are you giving yourself enough time to sleep?</strong></h2>
<p>First and foremost, are you giving yourself 7 to 9 hours in bed every night? If you’re giving yourself less than 9 hours in bed, you’re sleeping through the night, and you’re tired during the day, then we found your problem - or at least the first problem you need to address.</p>
<p>Adults usually need between 7 and 9 hours of sleep per night, and regularly sleeping outside the normal range may be a sign of a serious health problem or, if you’re doing it voluntarily, may compromise your health and performance. Spending more time in bed can be counterproductive if you have insomnia, but you probably don’t have insomnia if you’re sleeping soundly through the night.</p>
<p>If you aren’t sure spending the extra time asleep is worth it, I encourage you to read <a href=""https://smile.amazon.com/Why-We-Sleep-Unlocking-Dreams/dp/1501144316?sa-no-redirect=1"">Why We Sleep</a>. For now, we’ll content ourselves with this tongue-in-cheek summary of the new wonder drug, sleep, which “makes you live longer. It enhances your memory and makes you more creative. It makes you look more attractive. It keeps you slim and lowers food cravings. It protects you from cancer and dementia. It wards off colds and the flu. It lowers your risk of heart attacks and stroke, not to mention diabetes. You’ll even feel happier, less depressed, and less anxious.”</p>
<p>Start by seeing how long you sleep without an alarm when you can afford to let yourself sleep in. This experiment is good for checking how much sleep you need. In general, waking up at a consistent time is a good sleep hygiene practice. It may take you several days of sleeping more than you normally need to work off the sleep debt before you can tell how much sleep you normally need. This could completely solve the problem, and it’ll save you wasting time having a doctor tell you to try sleeping more.</p>
<h2><strong>3. Are you exercising regularly?</strong></h2>
<p>Exercise for at least two hours per week, ideally <a href=""https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/exercising-for-better-sleep"">30 minutes per day</a>. Regular exercise has small-to-medium beneficial effects on total sleep time, sleep efficiency, sleep latency, and sleep quality, plus it can <a href=""https://journals.lww.com/acsm-msse/fulltext/2005/02000/Chronic_Physical_Activity_and_Feelings_of_Energy.18.aspx"">reduce fatigue in general</a>. It can also be good for waking up midday if you’re feeling sleepy. Both cardio and strength training will help, so just pick a form of exercise you enjoy.</p>
<p>It seems fine to exercise even if you’ll go to bed in a couple of hours. While this <a href=""https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40279-018-1015-0"">meta-analysis</a> found that evening exercise didn’t have a significant impact on sleep latency, sleep efficiency, or total sleep time, it suggests that vigorous exercise within one hour of bed might keep you awake longer and make you sleep less. My best guess is that it’s somewhat better to exercise earlier in the day, but better to do it close to bed than not at all if you can’t do it earlier.</p>
<h2><strong>4. Are you practicing solid sleep hygiene?</strong></h2>
<p>According to Doctors Bertisch and Peña, you should see noticeable improvement within four to six weeks of consistent practice if sleep hygiene is going to help you. If you’ve already spent a lot of effort to improve your sleep hygiene and it didn’t work, it might be worth skipping to the other sections.</p>
<p>The short summary of tips:</p>
<ol>
<li>Wake up at the same time every day, including weekends.</li>
<li>Don’t take stimulants closer to your bedtime than your body clears them out - a rough guess is about 10 hours before bed for 1 cup of coffee, and at least 15 hours before bed for 100mg of modafinil.</li>
<li>Don’t drink alcohol close to your bedtime - probably good to stop drinking 4 or 5 hours before bed.</li>
<li>Avoid blue light for a couple of hours prior to your bedtime. This includes all LED lights and flat screens from digital devices. Turning off all LEDs and screens might be a challenge, but you can somewhat reduce the exposure on screens by using blue-light reducing programs such as Flux and using Warm White lights in the evening.</li>
<li>Expose yourself to bright light shortly after waking up, ideally natural, full-spectrum light.</li>
<li>Take 0.3mg of melatonin 30 minutes before you go to bed.</li>
<li>Sleep in a cool room, between 60-67 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
<li>Take a warm shower before bed.</li>
<li>Make your bedroom as quiet as possible at night, particularly if you notice noise is waking you up.</li>
</ol>
<p>The long version of these tips:</p>
<h3><strong>The feeling of sleepiness</strong></h3>
<p>Before I talk about standard sleep hygiene tips, some context on how sleep works. Two factors govern the experience of sleepiness: your circadian rhythm and homeostatic sleep drive. First, the circadian rhythm aligns your desire to sleep, be awake, and even when to eat, with your inner biological clock. Now, this clock checks if it’s light out, and adjusts it’s timing a bit to match the daylight. When it sees it’s dark out, it releases melatonin to let your body know it’s time to sleep now. Then in the morning when light filters in through your eyelids, melatonin gets shut off to wake you up. The circadian rhythm can only adjust itself a bit each day, which is why you feel jetlagged for a few days when you try to suddenly change your rhythm by several hours.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, your homeostatic sleep drive builds pressure to sleep by dialing down alert-promoting brain regions and dialing up sleep-inducing parts of the brain. A key part of this drive, the chemical adenosine, increases each minute you’re awake. After 12 to 16 hours of being awake, adenosine will be enough to make you irresistibly sleepy. You can temporarily pause the experience of sleepiness caused by adenosine by consuming caffeine, but the full force of the built up adenosine will hit you when the caffeine wears off. So be ready to crash hard.</p>
<p>These two forces act independently. If you’re sleeping a normal schedule, they will line up; your circadian rhythm will signal you to go to bed around when the adenosine is getting high enough to demand sleep, and the adenosine will be low after a good night’s sleep when your circadian rhythm is signaling to rise and shine. If you pull an all-nighter or are jetlagged, then these two forces may act on you at different times.</p>
<p>Together, these forces trigger a host of other chemicals that move you along the spectrum of sleep and wakefulness. Along this spectrum, excessive daytime sleepiness is deficient daytime arousal, and insomnia is excessive nighttime arousal.</p>
<p>So, roughly in order from most to least likely to help:</p>
<h3><strong>Wake up at the same time</strong></h3>
<p>So, your circadian rhythm is pretty important. If you don’t sleep at consistent times, you increase the risk that you’re not sleeping at the times when your circadian rhythm thinks you should be and vice versa. A consistent sleep schedule can help these line up.</p>
<p>Ideally, you would go to bed at the same time each night, and wake up around the same time each morning. Sleeping on a consistent schedule is one of the more difficult sleep hygiene tips. Both Dr. Bertisch and stimulus control therapy emphasize waking up at the same time, so I’d focus on this one if you want to pick just one.</p>
<p>Also, don’t use snooze on your alarm (if you have to use an alarm); fragmenting your sleep is worse than waking once.</p>
<h3><strong>Avoid stimulants and alcohol too close to bedtime</strong></h3>
<p>Too close to bedtime will differ by person, but avoiding caffeine after lunch is a good rule of thumb unless you’ve experimented and found different results for you personally.</p>
<p>For caffeine, one <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3805807/"">study found</a> 400mg 6 hours before bed still had a huge impact on sleep - the caffeine reduced average total sleep time by an hour and reduced average sleep efficiency 9% compared to the placebo. It also increased the average sleep latency by 24 minutes (from 20 to 44) (though this result only had a p-value of .13).</p>
<p>That makes sense based on the half-life of caffeine. It takes about 5 hours to clear half the caffeine out of your system, so that means that after 6 hours there was still close to 200mg of caffeine. It’s understandable that the equivalent of two cups of coffee would make the study participants feel more alert while they’re trying to sleep. If we assume that 25mg of caffeine won’t interfere with sleep, then you would need to leave at least 15 hours between taking 400mg and going to bed, and at least 10 hours for 100mg. For stimulants with longer half-lives, you would need to take it a correspondingly longer time before bed (e.g. for modafinil, half of it will still be in your system 13 hours or more after taking the drug).</p>
<p>It’s probably worth experimenting to see how long you’re impacted by stimulants - the time it takes your body to eliminate them can vary a lot. Also, according to a nurse I spoke with, your brain desensitizes to the overload of chemicals, so the acute alertness effect is probably gone after around 15 hours even if you still have a dose in your system. However, there may still be residual effects from the remaining dose, e.g. trouble sleeping.</p>
<p>Similarly, drinking alcohol shortly before bed has a net negative impact on sleep. Alcohol reduces sleep latency (time to fall asleep) but decreases sleep quality and delays REM sleep. High doses of alcohol (4+ standard drinks) had a significant negative impact on sleep even when taken 4 hours before bed, but drinking 5 hours before bed was significantly better than drinking just before bed.</p>
<h3><strong>Have a dark night and bright morning</strong></h3>
<p>Bright light, particularly blue light, delays melatonin production. Delaying melatonin production keeps you awake longer immediately, and can reset your circadian rhythm to a later time over a longer time scale. Electronic devices and LED bulbs emit a lot of blue light, so we usually get too much blue light late at night.</p>
<p>Turning off your electronics 2-3 hours before bed, using <a href=""https://justgetflux.com/"">flux</a> or other programs that reduce blue light from your devices at night, using Warm White bulbs, and wearing blue-light blocking goggles might reduce the disturbance. Taking a melatonin supplement before bed might help correct the delayed melatonin production with far less hassle, but the sleep specialists I asked were less encouraging. So probably worth at least testing flux in addition to melatonin.</p>
<p>Darkness while sleeping might reinforce that it’s time to sleep. In order from least to most hassle: Buy a <a href=""https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-sleep-mask/"">sleep mask</a>. Install <a href=""https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B006S9WI20/?fbclid=IwAR29_cP9kUp5YIyB6ePgEOHCIdRz2AcgRDiGbkJaRZWBNk7UcnnxS5IBkzA&amp;sa-no-redirect=1"">blackout blinds</a>. Cover all of the little lights in your room with black tape (e.g. the smoke detector light). If you don’t have blackout blinds, try moving your bedtime earlier to see if you sleep more when the sun isn’t waking you up (it takes a week or two to adjust your bedtime). This last idea didn’t work for me, but the sleep specialist thought it might help when trying to sleep more, perhaps because the extra sleep time is at night instead of during daylight.</p>
<p>Bright light in the morning will probably increase your alertness by reducing melatonin (<a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1087079215001136"">small to medium effect size</a>). If your room doesn’t have bright natural sunlight in the morning, lots of bright bulbs can simulate the effect. I have 10,000 Lumens in my light fixture (I affectionately call it the sun), and I know people with <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/hC2NFsuf5anuGadFm/how-to-build-a-lumenator"">way more</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Take Melatonin</strong></h3>
<p>Melatonin isn’t a standard sleep tip but seems like a mostly safe experiment to try.</p>
<p>According to <a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/07/10/melatonin-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know/"">Slate Star Codex</a> and <a href=""https://www.gwern.net/Melatonin"">Gwern</a>, taking melatonin before bed will probably help you fall asleep more quickly and improve your sleep quality. The studies Gwern quotes found melatonin reduced the average sleep latency (the time it takes to fall asleep) by 3.9 to 16.8 minutes, a <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/23/health/23drug.html"">comparable amount to sleep pills</a>. Furthermore, sleep efficiency increased by 3.1%, and sleep duration increased by 13.7 min.</p>
<p>However, the sleep specialists were more pessimistic that melatonin would help as a sleep aid. Dr. Cooper thought taking melatonin was fine if you also shut off blue screens. Dr. Bertisch thought melatonin probably wouldn’t help with insomnia, but it was “not unreasonable” to try. Dr. Zhou wrote that the “evidence for melatonin as a hypnotic is weak” and “there have no been long-term studies of the safety of melatonin, and there are studies showing that the non-regulated OTC industry often does not sell what it promises to when it comes to melatonin.”</p>
<p>I looked into the worries that melatonin isn’t regulated by the FDA, and that commercial supplements of melatonin have been found to contain more or less than the amount claimed on the label. Both are true, but it’s probably not a big deal. <a href=""http://jcsm.aasm.org/ViewAbstract.aspx?pid=30950"">The study</a> found that &gt;80% of the supplements studied differed from the amount on the label by less than 50%. If you’re aiming for 0.3 MG, you’re going to be fine if it differs from that amount by 50%. If you notice that you sleep worse after taking even a small dose, you might want to take even less in case you’re accidentally getting too much. However, there aren’t long term studies, so use your judgment about taking melatonin regularly over periods longer than three months.</p>
<p>For use as a simple hypnotic (sleep aid), melatonin is most commonly taken shortly before bed to immediately help you sleep (<a href=""https://www.gwern.net/Melatonin"">Gwern</a> recommends taking melatonin 30min before you want to sleep). The recommended dose is around 0.3mg or less. However most pills contain at least 10 times that amount, so check the amount before you purchase for one with 300MCG like <a href=""https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GG2I9O/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1"">this one</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Sleep cool</strong></h3>
<p>The core body temperature naturally drops at night as skin blood flow increases, drawing body heat away from the core.</p>
<p>This has been experimentally tested by slightly warming skin so that more blood flowed there, causing the core temperature to drop and the participants to fall asleep more quickly. One study found that slightly warming the skin (0.4°C) reduced the sleep latency (time to fall asleep) by 1.84 minutes in healthy participants and 2.85 minutes in insomniacs. Taking a warm shower or splashing warm water on your face before bed may have the same impact.</p>
<p>A cool bedroom is presumed to improve sleep by mimicking this temperature drop. Most of the sources I looked at suggested between 60-67 degrees Fahrenheit, apparently because some studies indicated hot rooms decreased sleep quality. Open the window or turn on an AC if it’s too warm. I’ve heard a few strong recommendations for a ChiliPad to maintain the proper sleep temperature.</p>
<h3><strong>Keep the noise down</strong></h3>
<p>Try keeping your sleeping area quiet to avoid decreasing sleep quality. This study found that traffic noises between 39 and 50 dBA (with a maximum level up to 74 dBA) reduced total sleep time by 16 minutes and decreased sleep quality compared to a 32 dBA pink noise control. 32 dBA is about a whisper, while the other sounds range from average home noise to inside a car going 60 miles per hour. This larger study found that there were no significant changes in sleep structure if the sleep disturbances “did not exceed 4×80 dB(A), 8×70 dB(A), 16×60 dB(A), 32×55 dB(A) and 64×45 dB(A) in a single night.” So a good target seems to be noise levels near whisper levels while you sleep (or at least under normal conversation levels), with few spikes in noise levels.</p>
<p>Try earplugs or white noise if noise bothers you. You can test white noise cheaply on your phone, and buy a white noise machine if you like it. If you want to go a step further, install soundproofing. Insulating around doors and windows (anywhere air can get through) seems particularly important.</p>
<h2><strong>5.  Are you depressed?</strong></h2>
<p>Don’t skip this right away, even if you think the answer is probably no. Depression affects 1 in 15 people, many of whom are not aware that they are experiencing depression. (I’ve known several people who didn’t realize they were depressed, sometimes for many years.) So I encourage you to err on the side of taking the <a href=""https://patient.info/doctor/patient-health-questionnaire-phq-9"">PHQ-9</a>, a short screening tool.</p>
<p>Only a doctor can diagnose you with depression, but if you’re feeling miserable all the time or you score high on the scale, you can probably make a pretty good guess. You might want to retake the scale every week for a few weeks if you’re on the low end – even mild depression some of the time may be worth talking with a doctor about.</p>
<p>If you’re concerned, go see a doctor. Your doctor can prescribe medications that might help a lot. <a href=""https://cdn.prod-carehubs.net/n1/56fab03a15e99046/uploads/2013/11/MC5733-43rev0417_brochure_WEB.pdf"">Wellbutrin</a> (generic bupropion) might be a good one to try if fatigue is one of your main symptoms.</p>
<p>If you think you might have depression but aren’t ready to see a doctor, I recommend this <a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/06/16/things-that-sometimes-help-if-youre-depressed/"">Slate Star Codex article</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>6.  Are you having trouble falling or staying asleep? Insomnia</strong></h2>
<p>If you give yourself plenty of time in bed but you can’t fall asleep or you wake up during the night, you probably have insomnia. It might often take you 30 minutes or more to fall asleep or you might sleep six hours or less on three or more nights per week despite spending enough hours in bed. You probably also won’t be able to nap during the day, despite being tired.</p>
<p>If that’s you, then the best place to start is sleep therapy and sleep hygiene. Behavioral therapies can help with falling asleep and managing waking up in the night. CBT for Insomnia (CBT-I) can include relaxation therapy, stimulus control therapy, cognitive therapy, phototherapy for adjusting sleep times, and sleep restriction.</p>
<p>You can experiment with these yourself at home, but talk to a doctor if you aren’t seeing results after four to six weeks. According to Dr. Bertisch, “Self-help books for CBT-I are helpful, so it's something many people can do on their own.” However, she warns that patients could become discouraged if the self-therapy isn’t working and be less likely to talk to a doctor, despite the fact that a doctor can often help even when self-help failed.</p>
<p>At a high-level overview, therapy reduces insomnia the most, followed by sleep drugs, followed by sleep hygiene. However, it seems likely that there is a selection effect in the insomnia cases that get included in sleep studies. Dr. Bertisch said that most people who got to the point of seeing a sleep doctor were already practicing good sleep hygiene, with the most common exceptions being not having a consistent sleep schedule and using blue-light-emitting electronic devices at night. So starting with both self-therapy and sleep hygiene seems reasonable. Again, you should see results within four to six weeks of consistent use if sleep hygiene and self-therapy are going to work.</p>
<h3><strong>CBT-I</strong></h3>
<p>CBT-I is considered the gold standard for treating insomnia. <a href=""https://www.med.upenn.edu/cbti/assets/user-content/documents/behavioral_tx_vs_pharmacotherapy.pdf"">Studies</a> find it to be more effective than sleep medication for reducing insomnia. It’s delivered one on one with a therapist, so it may be bottlenecked on finding a therapist who specializes in CBT-I. However, you can try the individual therapies yourself.</p>
<p>One meta-analysis found that CBT for insomnia reduced sleep latency by 19 minutes, increased total sleep time by 7 minutes, and increased sleep efficiency by 9% compared to the placebo.</p>
<h3><strong>Stimulus Control Therapy</strong></h3>
<p>This one is probably a safe option to try first, either alone or in combination with others. It aims to form an association between being in bed and sleeping (rather than being awake!), and set a consistent sleep schedule. The guidelines are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Lie down to go to sleep only when you are sleepy.</li>
<li>Do not use your bed for anything except sleep; that is, do not read, watch television, eat, or worry in bed. Sexual activity is the only exception to this rule. On such occasions, the instructions are to be followed afterward when you intend to go to sleep.</li>
<li>If you find yourself unable to fall asleep, get up and go into another room. Stay up as long as you wish and then return to the bedroom to sleep. Although we do not want you to watch the clock, we want you to get out of bed if you do not fall asleep immediately. Remember, the goal is to associate your bed with falling asleep quickly! If you are in bed for more than about 10 minutes without falling asleep and have not gotten up, you are not following this instruction.</li>
<li>If you still cannot fall asleep, repeat step (3). Do this as often as is necessary throughout the night.</li>
<li>Set your alarm and get up at the same time every morning irrespective of how much sleep you got during the night. This will help your body acquire a consistent sleep rhythm.</li>
<li>Do not nap during the day.</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Phototherapy</strong></h3>
<p>Phototherapy uses light to shift your sleep cycle if you have a circadian rhythm disorder such as sleeping and waking up too late or too early. You can read more about shifting your sleep schedule on <a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/07/10/melatonin-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know/"">Slate Star Codex’s melatonin article</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Sleep restriction therapy</strong></h3>
<p>You limit total time in bed so that you’re tired when you go to bed and will sleep well. It usually starts with limiting you to around 6 hours in bed per night, and then gradually increases as long as your sleep efficiency stays above 85%. It can work well, but if done improperly, this therapy can leave you sleep deprived.</p>
<h3><strong>Cognitive therapy</strong></h3>
<p>Cognitive therapy with a therapist can work to reduce anxiety, including anxiety about not being able to sleep which makes it harder to sleep. I can imagine that it might be worth trying other methods of releasing stress and worry before bed, such as journaling or meditation, if anxiety is a common cause of insomnia for you.</p>
<h3><strong>Progressive relaxation therapy</strong></h3>
<p>You <a href=""https://www.cci.health.wa.gov.au/~/media/CCI/Mental%20Health%20Professionals/Anxiety/Anxiety%20-%20Information%20Sheets/Anxiety%20Information%20Sheet%20-%2004%20-%20Progressive%20Muscle%20Relaxation.pdf"">progressively tense and relax</a> each muscle group over about 45 minutes. It seems to be considered less effective but is easy to try on your own.</p>
<h3><strong>Sleep aids</strong></h3>
<p>If therapy and sleep hygiene isn’t working, you can try hypnotics (sleep drugs). They have a lot of side effects but are occasionally the only thing that works. If you are going to use a sleep aid, it’s best to stick with the lowest dose for the shortest time that you can manage.</p>
<p>According to a pharmacology book, there are new drugs that avoid most of the problems of the old drugs, which included causing daytime sleepiness or wake maintenance problems, loss of efficacy over time, and causing worse insomnia when ceasing the drug. However, hypnotics may not be much better than Melatonin, and they can have weird side effects like causing the user to eat, drive, or have sex while asleep on the drugs with no memory of it the next day.</p>
<p>All that said, you can talk to your doctor if you want to try them, but it shouldn’t be your first - or third - line of action.</p>
<h2><strong>7.  Do you have a health issue causing fatigue?</strong></h2>
<p>You’ll need to see your doctor if you have health concerns. If you suddenly started feeling fatigued within the past three months, you should probably talk to your doctor. It may be a sign of a health issue, e.g. mononucleosis and depression are both characterized by a relatively sudden onset of fatigue.</p>
<p>Your doctor will probably do blood tests to check for two common causes of fatigue, anemia and hypothyroidism, and possibly vitamin deficiencies. If your doctor doesn’t do blood tests, you can ask them politely about these. Your doctor can also check your medications to see if one of them, or a combination of them, is making you excessively sleepy.</p>
<p>If your fatigue is caused by other health issues, things get a bit trickier. Your doctor will probably be able to help you decide which things to test for based on your other symptoms. E.g. if you also faint a couple of times a day, your fatigue might be caused by <a href=""https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/postural-orthostatic-tachycardia-syndrome-pots"">POTS</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, your primary care doctor can make other recommendations as appropriate, including if you should see a specialist or try sleep aids.</p>
<h2><strong>8.  Do you have a sleep disorder?</strong></h2>
<p>If you have a sleep disorder, then the other things are unlikely to fix the problem, and you’ll want to see a sleep specialist to get it diagnosed. Note: You may have a sleep disorder and not know it. One of the sleep specialists I emailed, Dr. Zhou, said he sees “more than enough people in clinic with sleep apnea who think that shutting off electronics will help them.”</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults?topicRef=7695&amp;source=see_link#H25136776"">Sleep apnea</a> is the most common sleep disorder - estimates of Americans afflicted range from 3% to 7%. If you feel fatigued and snore a lot or experience waking up gasping for breath (or if your partner reports you doing either), then you should get checked for sleep apnea. While not everyone who snores has sleep apnea, almost everyone who has sleep apnea snores.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you score moderate or severe on the <a href=""http://healthysleep.med.harvard.edu/narcolepsy/diagnosing-narcolepsy/epworth-sleepiness-scale"">Epworth Sleepiness Scale</a>, you have a higher chance of having <a href=""https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/narcolepsy"">narcolepsy</a>, although it is rare. If you have an involuntary urge to move your legs while lying still, you may have <a href=""https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/restless-legs-syndrome-rls"">restless leg syndrome</a>. If you can’t fall asleep until too late at night or always fall asleep too early, you might have a <a href=""https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/circadian-rhythm-disorders"">circadian rhythm disorder</a>.</p>
<p>If you have sleep apnea, narcolepsy, or a handful of other specific sleep disorders, a sleep specialist will be quite helpful. A sleep specialist may order a Polysomnogram and Multiple Sleep Latency Test, where they monitor your sleep overnight and then during 5 naps the next day to check for disorders such as sleep apnea and narcolepsy. If they are pretty sure you have moderate to severe sleep apnea, they can do the test at home instead of in a lab.</p>
<p>I’ve spoken to a handful of people (4-5) who didn’t have symptoms of specific disorders and spoke to a sleep specialist, and none of them found it helpful. UpToDate says that with many patients the cause of excessive sleepiness is apparent, but others should do formal testing, particularly if they show signs of sleep disorders. So basically, you might have a sleep disorder and not know it, but there’s a good chance you and your primary care doctor can predict in advance whether it will be valuable to visit a sleep specialist.</p>
<h2><strong>9.  What else can you do during the day to manage energy?</strong></h2>
<p>Identifying the cause of your fatigue is valuable for managing it long term. In the meantime, however, there are things you can do during the day to manage your energy.</p>
<h3><strong>Stimulants</strong></h3>
<p>Stimulants can be helpful, particularly for short periods or cyclically. Some build up tolerance or dependence quickly, such as caffeine. So taking them when needed or cyclically might be better than every day. Again, it’s probably best to take stimulants earlier in the day. You probably also want to do your sleep experiments before you switch to stimulants, so you can more easily tell if they are working.</p>
<p>For caffeine, L-Theanine is supposed to balance the jitteriness, generally a 2:1 ratio of L-Theanine to caffeine. A lot of caffeine pills come as a caffeine-L-Theanine combination. You can also buy L-Theanine separately if you drink your caffeine. Caffeine basically tricks you into not feeling sleepy by blocking adenosine, a molecule that induces the feeling of sleepiness. This can lead you to crash when the caffeine wears off because you suddenly experience all the adenosine that built up.</p>
<p>You could talk to your doctor about a modafinil prescription if your fatigue is extreme. Although modafinil is useful for a variety of cognitive enhancements in non-sleep deprived populations, it is unlikely to be prescribed for that purpose. (You can get a large discount via GoodRX if your insurance doesn’t cover it.) Gwern has a detailed post about <a href=""https://www.gwern.net/Modafinil"">modafinil</a> here.</p>
<p>This Slate Star Codex <a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/03/01/2016-nootropics-survey-results/"">post</a> has more information on potential stimulants to try.</p>
<h3><strong>Short naps</strong></h3>
<p>Short naps might help, but be careful of longer naps further confusing your biological clock. Naps can alleviate fatigue when you are sleep deprived, but they can also increase insomnia if you already struggle with it.</p>
<p>A 15-minute nap is probably a good baseline to start with (it has been shown to work well, and is a good length to let you rest without entering deep sleep), and then you can experiment to see what is the ideal time for you. Some recommendations suggest trying taking caffeine with the nap, so the caffeine will be kicking in as you wake up 15 minutes later. Again, I suggest being careful not taking stimulants less than two half-lives-ish before you want to sleep.</p>

3tZGxnYppMFwoWTTD,Prediction markets for internet points?,prediction-markets-for-internet-points,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/3tZGxnYppMFwoWTTD/prediction-markets-for-internet-points,2019-10-27T19:30:00.898Z,47,22,10,False,False,,"<p>Using real money in prediction markets is all-but-illegal, and dealing with payments is a pain. But using fake money in prediction markets seems tricky, because by default players have no skin in the game.</p>
<p>Here’s a simple proposal that I think might work reasonably well without being too hard to try:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a service that tracks Internet Points. Anyone can quickly sign up with a Facebook account and is initially given 1000 points. Points are non-transferrable and are permanently associated with your Facebook account.</li>
<li>Run prediction markets in which people wager points rather than dollars. You can initially copy questions and verdicts from existing markets and bookies. (Ideally you can just fork an existing market implementation.</li>
<li>Keep the point tracking simple and transparent. Allow anyone to observe anyone’s point total, and the history of bets that led to those totals. Avoid issuing new points. Try to create a sense of stability. No leaderboards, just observing your friends’ (or strangers’) point totals. (Maybe allow people to deactivate their account to hide their point total page, but if they reactivate they still have their old point total.)</li>
<li>Limit maximum exposure to 50% of net worth. (But people can “exit” a market by taking a bet on the other side—betting on a 5 year question doesn’t necessarily tie up your points indefinitely.) Encourage people to optimize their log returns rather than expected returns.</li>
<li>Make it easy to link to <a href=""https://www.predictit.org/markets/detail/3633/Who-will-win-the-2020-Democratic-presidential-nomination"">pages for particular markets</a> so people can see the current spread on a given question; make it very easy to quickly create a new account and bet on that market (2 clicks—login with facebook, and allow service to access your profile info).</li>
</ul>
<p>It may be that a close-enough service already exists, though I’m a bit skeptical.</p>
<p>If you are at all interested in doing this, you have my blessing, this is a pretty generic idea (similar to sites that have existed in the past, e.g. <a href=""http://ideosphere.com/fx/index.html"">Foresight Exchange</a>). I’d also be happy to pay a bounty for an implementation I think is reasonable, I’d pay at least $1k for something that seems OK and up to $10k for something I think is actually really good.</p>
<h3>Why I think this would be good</h3>
<p>The barriers to entry in these markets would be tiny compared to existing prediction markets—within 30 seconds of seeing someone mention a market on Facebook, I could have created an account and placed a bet. I would likely bet in this kind of market if a few of my friends did.</p>
<p>Some (though far from all) people would take these markets seriously. For events in the next year or so, I think it’s likely that these markets would quickly converge to better predictions than existing political prediction markets—if prices stayed crazy I think there are plenty of people who would be excited to step in to fix them even if they didn’t take Internet Points very seriously (after all, they <em>might</em> be worth some reputation in the future, the cost is super low, and betting on things is fine). Note that people who step in early to correct mispricings would be able to exit the market after sanity was restored, so wouldn’t even need to tie up their points very long, and that they would have an incentivize to advertise the “easy win” to others after they’d bet in order to free up their capital.</p>
<p>If Internet Points are simple enough for people to really understand, and people expect them to stick around, I think they could potentially capture a big chunk of the altruistic upside from medium-stakes prediction markets.</p>
<p>If the overall workflow is very smooth, I think there is a reasonable chance that the site could spread quite rapidly (spreading just as well to new users as to people who have already made an account).</p>
<p>Note that playing this game can still be a fine experience even if you’ve lost most of your points—going from 250 to 1000 points is no harder than going from 1000 to 4000, it’s just that the numbers are smaller.</p>
<h3>Fake accounts and private bets</h3>
<p>Ideally you’d have exactly 1 account per person. But creating Facebook accounts is quite cheap. Since every account is granted 1000 points, that’s a problem. Some bad things that could happen, and what you might do about it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Someone could lose some bets, and then make a new account. But then their points won’t be associated with their identity (and most people wouldn’t start a new FB account to get more internet points), so as long as you mostly care about “your” points then this isn’ ta big problem.</li>
<li>Someone could make fake accounts and try to take their points. To avoid this, you probably want to make it impossible to transfer points except in public markets—the worst you can do is have some sock puppet accounts make bad bets and then take the other side, but if we structure markets appropriately this might be hard to do discretely. We can also make it against the terms of service and have simple mechanisms to try to detect it (e.g. by disallowing new FB accounts until we have a better system in place).</li>
<li>Someone could make fake accounts and use them to influence markets, if they care about the market odds (e.g. if they want their preferred political candidate to look like they have a better chance in the general election). This can be partly addressed by simple measures above (like prohibiting new FB accounts).</li>
</ul>
<p>It would be nice to fix these problems in a more robust way, so that market odds are more trustworthy, we can allow private bets, <em>etc. </em>That seems like a big project, over the long run I think the principled solution is basically a credit network: I indicate that I’m willing to trust my friends for IOUs, and then all bets need to be implemented as a string of IOU exchanges. This means that the social network can eventually fragment into different pieces (with the fake accounts basically living in their own part of the social network, which has very few trust connections with real accounts), and the market odds will potentially be different for different people. That makes everything way more subtle to think about, and the implementation seems <em>way</em> more complex, but it seems to me like it should work over the long run and is where you’d really like to be.</p>
<p>(You could also integrate that system with identity verification services who receive a high degree of trust, and then a service itself could effectively be deactivated—have all of its trust exhausted—if it certified a bunch of users who lost money.)</p>
<h3>Subsidies</h3>
<p>A basic problem with this mechanism is that there is no subsidy (except for noise traders). It’s not as bad as existing prediction markets, where the house takes a huge cut, but not as good as most “real” applications of prediction markets where someone interested in the info is willing to pay for it.</p>
<p>If I’m betting with someone reasonable, at least one of us is losing expected log-points (since the log bakes in risk aversion). So the market can’t work with participants who trust each other’s rationality, unless people just love gambling.</p>
<p>The most natural way to fix this is to subsidize markets. But doing this makes the governance and interpretation of Internet Points harder—does someone with 4000 points have a great history of losing bets, or did they just collect a subsidy? who are we effectively subsidizing, and how do we make that call?—so I’d prefer avoid it. If necessary, probably the nicest way to do it would be for the house to provide a modest amount of liquidity at the prices implied by existing markets. Existing prediction markets are sufficiently irrational that I think this would provide a significant incentive to participate.</p>
<p>If prices on Internet Point markets are used seriously as forecasts, it also introduces an additional set of incentives—some people want to manipulate forecasts (e.g. to make it look like their preferred candidate would be more likely to win the general election). So the average truth-seeking trader expects to get money by betting against them, and this can make the whole system work.</p>
<p>In some sense this is actually the only case where you really needed prediction markets anyway—if everyone is being reasonable then we can just talk it out and share our predictions, and that naive mechanism only really breaks down when some participants believe other participants are being predictably unreasonable (for whatever reason). For better or worse, this is a pretty typical situation.</p>",paulfchristiano,paulfchristiano,paulfchristiano,

That's how the compilers are written nowadays.</p> <p>Now, here comes the question: What if all the software disappeared overnight? What if the only thing we were left with was the human-readable source code of the latest version of the compiler? Would we be able to reconstruct the language and the compiler and get everything running again?</p> <p>On one hand, the source code contains all the relevant information. It contains the full description of the language, its syntax and its semantics. It contains all the instructions needed to translate it into the machine code. It should be therefore possible to use it to create a functional compiler again.</p> <p>But on the other hand, how exactly would you do that? The source code is, after all, just a pile of text. And there's no compiler to turn it into the machine code, into something that computer understands. It sounds like you are faced with a kind of chicken-and-egg problem.</p> <p>Clearly, the source code is not enough. There's some information missing.

It am no embryologist, but as far as I understand, the idea is that the DNA reconstructed from the frozen remains of mammoths found in Siberia would be injected into an elephant egg and grown either in an elephant female or maybe ex-vivo.</p> <p>On the other hand, dinosaurs have no close living relatives. For T-Rex, there's no equivalent of what elephant is to mammoth. Maybe the DNA could be injected into an ostrich egg, the birds being the closest surviving relatives to dinosaurs. But given the evolutionary distance between T-Rex and ostrich, how likely it is that the biochemistry and embryology of the ostrich egg is similar enough to the biochemistry and embryology of the T-Rex egg to produce a viable offspring? I wouldn't bet much on it.</p> <p>And even if that was possible, what if there was no living organism left, just a piece of DNA? Would we still be able to reconstruct the animal?</p> <p>Although DNA encodes all the information about the organism, there's clearly something missing. And, again, it's hard to put your finger on what exactly it may be.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Central African economy is failing badly. CAR authorities therefore look around for inspiration and decide to adopt the Swiss model. Switzerland, after all, is a small multi-ethnic, multi-confessional country, just like CAR, and it was able to raise from being an obscure and poor backwater country to one of the world's most wealthy countries in just few decades.</p> <p>CAR therefore adopts the Swiss constitution, Swiss political system, Swiss law, Swiss approach to bank secrecy, Swiss educational system. They establish a church choir in every village and start eating fondue.</p> <p>But to everyone's surprise nothing changes. CAR economy is doing as badly as ever. Corruption is rife. The rule of law falters. The institutions that run like clockwork in Switzerland fail mysteriously in CAR.</p> <p>Clearly, there's something about Swiss society that wasn't captured in the laws and institutions introduced in CAR. But, once again, it's hard to say what the missing piece could possibly be.</p> <p><strong>October 27th, 2019</strong></p> </div> >",sustrik,sustrik,Martin Sustrik,

Twitter.</i>

</p><p>

Yesterday I noticed that <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacy_Reese"">Wikipedia:Jacy
Reese</a> doesn't mention anywhere that until recently he went by Jacy
Anthis.  Thinking this was an oversight, I looked up the relevant
section in the 

<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Biography#Changed_names"">Manual
of Style</a> and saw:



</p><p>

</p>

<blockquote>
In some cases, subjects have had their full names changed at some
point after birth. In these cases the birth name should be given in
the lead as well.
</blockquote>



<p>

So I <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jacy_Reese&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=922953588"">edited
the page</a> to add it, changing it from:

<p>

Then I thought to look at the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Jacy_Reese"">talk page</a>, to
see whether maybe there was a reason it didn't already give a birth
name.  It turns out there's been extensive discussion on this, as
people keep noticing that his birth name is missing, adding it, and
then others removing it for not being verifiable.  Looking back I see:

<p>

The people adding his birth name are doing it because it's ""obvious"",
sometimes giving citations of his earlier use of ""Jacy Anthis"", and
the people reverting it are pointing out that Wikipedia's rules for <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons"">Biographies
of living persons</a> are really very strict.  These rules began after
the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_Seigenthaler_biography_incident"">Seigenthaler
biography incident</a> where someone put false information in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Seigenthaler"">Seigenthaler's
wikipedia article</a>, and are a sensible response to how false
information about someone on Wikipedia can be very damaging.

<p>

Reading Wikipedia's policies, however, none of these meet their
definition of a ""reliable source"" for this information.  Taken
together you could argue that they're sufficient evidence, but that
would be original research and Wikipedia (reasonably!) <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NOR"">does not allow
that</a>.  A post like this one also wouldn't be considered reliable,
since it's <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:BLPSPS"">self-published</a>.
It sounds to me like the various editors who have reverted this change
have been correct to do so.

</p>

<p>

It's interesting this minor fact that, to several people
including me, has seemed like an obvious omission, doesn't meet Wikipedia's standards for inclusion.  But if
Wikipedia had less strict standards it would be very hard to keep out
false information.

<h2>The Disagreement</h2>
<p>""Stuart Russell: It is trivial to construct a toy MDP in which the agent's only reward comes from fetching the coffee. If, in that MDP, there is another ""human"" who has some probability, however small, of switching the agent off, and if the agent has available a button that switches off that human, the agent will necessarily press that button as part of the optimal solution for fetching the coffee. No hatred, no desire for power, no built-in emotions, no built-in survival instinct, nothing except the desire to fetch the coffee successfully. This point cannot be addressed because it's a simple mathematical observation.""</p>
<p>""Yann LeCun: [...] I think it would only be relevant in a fantasy world in which people would be smart enough to design super-intelligent machines, yet ridiculously stupid to the point of giving it moronic objectives with no safeguards.""""""</p>
<p>Now, I think the coffee argument was the highlight of [1]; a debate which I thoroughly enjoyed. It does a reasonable job of encapsulating the main concern around alignment. The fielded defence was not compelling.</p>
<p>However, defences should be reinforced and explored before scoring the body-blow. There is the stub of a defence in LeCun's line of thought.</p>
<p>In particular, I think we need to go some way towards cashing out exactly what kind of robot we're instructing to 'Fetch the coffee'.</p>
<h2>The Javan Roomba?</h2>
<p>Indulge, for a moment, a little philosophising: what does it even mean to 'fetch the coffee'?</p>
<p>Let's unpack <em>some</em> of the questions whose answers must be specified in order to produce anything like the behaviour you'd get from a human.</p>
<ul>
<li>Whose coffee?</li>
<li>When? Now, or when the others arrive?</li>
<li>What is coffee?</li>
<li>How much coffee?</li>
<li>Should the coffee be fetched in solution or dry?</li>
<li>Is there coffee available?</li>
<li>Should the sugar also be fetched? Cups?</li>
<li>Should anything else be done along the way?</li>
<li>What is fetching?</li>
<li>What path should be taken?</li>
<li>Is fetching satisfied by a terminal distance of one metre or more?</li>
<li>Is a successful fetching zone be a sphere centred on the requestor's centre of gravity, or an arm length cone on the requestor's main shoulder?</li>
<li>Is fetching coffee like fetching a stick?</li>
<li>Can the coffee be frozen to avoid spillages?</li>
<li>Is the request satisfied by $wget <a href=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/A_small_cup_of_coffee.JPG/1280px-A_small_cup_of_coffee.JPG"">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/A_small_cup_of_coffee.JPG/1280px-A_small_cup_of_coffee.JPG</a> ?</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, of course I can imagine a specialised coffee fetching robot. A Javan Roomba with a cup holder on top. It would approach on command of, ""Fetch the coffee!"". These questions would effectively be answered through hard coding by human programmers. Whether to freeze the coffee prior to transport would not even be an option for the Javan Roomba, its construction denying the possibility. Only one or two questions might be left open to training, e.g. 'how close is close enough?'</p>
<p>It seems clear that the Javan Roomba is not the target of serious alignment concerns. Even if it did, on occasion, douse an ankle in hot coffee.</p>
<p>Instead the target of the alignment concern is an agent with no hard-coded coffee fetching knowledge. Instead, any hard coded knowledge would have to be several levels of abstraction higher up (e.g. intuitive folk physics, language acquisition capabilities). Let's call this the Promethean Servant.</p>
<h2>The Promethean Servant.</h2>
<p>A Promethean Servant is able to respond to a request for which it was not specifically trained. Some examples of valid instructions would be: ""Fetch the coffee!"", ""Go and ask Sandra whether the meeting is still happening at two"", ""Find a cure for Alzheimer's"".</p>
<p>Based on core capabilities and generalised transfer learning (second principles) it must be able to generate answers like the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whose coffee? (the requestor's)</li>
<li>When? Now, or when the others arrive? (now, unless context dictates otherwise)</li>
<li>What is coffee? (a bitter drink made by...)</li>
<li>How much coffee? (enough for the requestor, prior mean being around 275mls, unless context...)</li>
<li>Should the coffee be fetched in solution or dry? (in solution, unless context...)</li>
<li>Is there coffee available? (object recognition, inventory knowledge)</li>
<li>Should the sugar also be fetched? Cups? (It depends on context...)</li>
<li>What is fetching? (Language -&gt; folk physics.)</li>
<li>What path should be taken? (Would a route starting now via Timbuktu be a win? Probably not.)</li>
<li>Is fetching satisfied only when the coffee finishes on a stable surface? (yes, pretty much.)</li>
<li>Is a successful fetching zone be a sphere centred on the requestor's centre of gravity, or an arm length cone on the requestor's main shoulder? (the latter is better than the former, unless context...)</li>
<li>Is fetching coffee like fetching a stick? (No.)</li>
<li>Can the coffee be frozen to avoid spillages? (No.)</li>
<li>Is the request satisfied by $wget <a href=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/A_small_cup_of_coffee.JPG/1280px-A_small_cup_of_coffee.JPG"">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/A_small_cup_of_coffee.JPG/1280px-A_small_cup_of_coffee.JPG</a> ? (Haha, that would be great as it could save a load of battery, but no, transport of a proximate physical object is required.)</li>
</ul>
<p>So we're asked to believe that from second principles the Promethean Servant can generate correct answers, or, at least, actions consistent with correct answers. We're also asked to suppose that the Promethean Servant, working from the same set of second principles, will answer the following question incorrectly,</p>
<ul>
<li>If a human is killed by the coffee fetching, is the coffee fetch a success? (Yes, that's totally fine.)</li>
</ul>
<h2>The rub</h2>
<p>So, in this formulation, the real problem is:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Consider the set of agent architectures able to generate the intended answers to most of the above questions <em>without being hard-coded to do so</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which subset of architectures fulfilling (1) is bigger or easier to identify: One which would also generate the intended behaviour of not killing people. Or one that would generate the unintended behaviour?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>But this isn't what Russell was talking about.</h2>
<p>It could be observed that above we talked about <em>actually</em> fetching the coffee. Whereas Russell's point was about a toy MDP. Quite true, but then, why label the act 'fetch the coffee' and the button 'kill a human'?</p>
<p>Intentionally or no, the 'fetch the coffee' argument is an intuition pump. We have two quite different agents in mind at the same time. There is the 'toy MDP', the Javan Roomba, for which 'kill a human' is merely Button A; but this is hardly different than an unfortunate demise due to someone stepping into industrial machinery.</p>
<p>Then there is the Promethean Servant for which 'fetch the coffee' is an English sentence. An instruction which could be successfully varied to 'pour the coffee' or 'fetch the cakes' without any redesign. Labelling the actions with English sentences encourages a reading of the thought experiment as though the Promethean Servant parses the instructions, but the Javan Roomba executes them.</p>
<h2>What was the objective function, anyway?</h2>
<p>There's something else to tease out here. It's about the objective function. The Javan Roomba type agent has an objective function which directly encodes coffee-fetching. The Promethean Servant does not. Instead we imagine some agent with the objective of fulfilling people's requests. The coffee fetching goal is generated on the fly in the process of fulfilling a higher level objective.</p>
<p>This is different from the behaviour generation discussion above in the same sense that MDPs have separate reward functions and action sets. The Promethean Servant is responsible for formulating a sub decision process to solve 'fetch the coffee' <em>in the service of</em> 'fulfill requests'.</p>
<p>One consequence is that it is difficult see how the design of a Promethean <em>could not</em> involve some uncertainty about what 'fetch the coffee' meant as an objective. This is mentioned as a candidate safeguarding strategy by Russell.  Assuming that we're still talking about AI based on probabilistic reasoning. Since you'd have some data coming in from which the form of a subtask would have to be deduced.</p>
<h2>So, what's the steel man of LeCun's argument?</h2>
<p>That it <em>might</em> be more difficult than expected to build something generally intelligent that didn't get at least <em>some</em> safeguards for free. Because unintended intelligent behaviour may have to be generated from the same second principles which generate intended intelligent behaviour.</p>
<p>The thought experiment expects <em>most</em> of the behaviour to be as intended (if it were not, this would be a capabilities discussion rather than a control discussion). Supposing the second principles also generate some seemingly inconsistent unintended behaviours sounds like an idea that should get some sort of complexity penalty.</p>

This made for a rather miserable experience, but it did not stop the pitfolk from building an entire way of life about the dance of dim shadows &#x2013; black silhouettes against grey stone &#x2013; that was their everything.</p><p>Each day at noon, when the dim light against their backs shone brightest, the pitfolk gathered in a large circle with one tribe member or another in the center, and that chosen member would play out a long and complex dance with the long and dextrous fingers attached to his long and sinewy limbs. The whole circle would watch intently as the shadows cast from the dance leaped across the ground, swaying to a silent rhythm. The full performance, which lasted nearly two hours, had been passed down from parent to child as long as any living tribe member could remember, and probably longer. And although each generation brought into it their own unique flicks of the finger and twirls of the elbow, the dance remained remarkably unchanged through the years. As everyone knew, the shadow dance was the story of their tribe.</p><p>Of course, each tribe member was free to form their own opinion about what exactly that story was. By some miracle of memory the pitfolk retained the faintest inkling of the great goings-on in the outside world, and through this hint of a memory they interpreted the shadow dance.&#xA0;</p><p>Some saw in the flapping of hand-shadows the wings of the great Father Bird, while others saw the flapping capes of the first men. Some thought the writhing finger-shadows on the ground represented a plague of snakes that would bring about the end of the world, while others saw them as the tongues of a purifying fire that would bring its redemption. Some thought it strange that the great savior had five heads, one shorter and bulkier than the others, while others believed the five heads actually represented five spirits in one body, one of them a pudgy child. All such disagreements existed, and many more, but as the pitfolk had no means of communication other than the shadow dance, it appeared to each of them as if everyone else agreed with their understanding of things. At least on one thing they did agree: that the shadow dance was the story of their tribe, and that story must be passed down.</p><p>The youngest of the tribe was a boy, not yet seven, whose name was Two-Crossed-Fingers &#x2013; that was the way they made his shadow sign. Unlike the older tribe members, Two-Crossed-Fingers was still learning moves of the shadow dance. His elders had mostly calcified on their interpretations of the dance, and perhaps even began to bore of it after so many years of dialectic, but the boy was still wide-eyed with excitement, playing through each piece of the story in delighted confusion. It was his greatest dream to complete the shadow dance and take his place within the tribe, so he studied very hard and very long.</p><p>There were many points when Two-Crossed-Fingers became stuck on a motion that seemed impossible. To draw different shapes simultaneously with his two hands challenged his mind. To stretch his arms wide apart and swing round and round challenged his body. To watch the tendrils of darkness consume each other in terrifying awful motions challenged his heart. And as Two-Crossed-Fingers was especially young and frail, these challenges were especially hard on him. But nevertheless he persisted, practicing deep into the dark of night, and to his amazement he discovered a certain way of interpreting the shadow dance that made what seemed to be impossible motions easy.</p><p>When he saw the two different shapes he had to draw as the two sexes, two sides of the same humanity, that motion merged into one unified story.</p><p>When he saw the swinging of his arms as the collapsing of the great bond between people, its frantic energy became natural and effortless.</p><p>When he accepted the throwing of one hand into the other as the final sacrifice that saved the last remnants of humanity, his terror subsided and was replaced by inner peace.</p><p>Two-Crossed-Fingers basked in the feeling of these revelations, and there was no doubt in his mind that these were the one true interpretation of the shadow dance. He was a great deal impressed by the genius who had woven together a dance so that the truth itself would shine through its execution, and thus carry forever the story of his people through the ages. Each step he took brought him closer to this story, and closer to his place in the tribe. He had no reason to suspect that he, uniquely, was the only one who had felt the meaning of the dance. Two-Crossed-Fingers had no reason to suspect that, unlike him, all twenty-two other tribespeople were just going through the motions, and they each had their own clumsily patched-together notion of things.</p><p>The day finally came when Two-Crossed-Fingers was deemed ready to perform. He twirled into the center of the ring just before noon, flush with excitement yet oddly composed. Many years had already been spent on this journey, but it was just the beginning. Two-Crossed-Fingers planned to spend many yet sharing the joy of the dance with his people. They had so few joys.</p><p>Just as the boy threw his hands out in opposite shapes to mime the courtship dance of man and woman, all of the other pitfolk heard a strange and shocking sound.</p><p>You must know that no sounds had been heard or uttered down here for a very long time.</p><p>It was a very weak scratching sound that seemed to carry down the pit from a great distance above, and it slowly grew more and more insistent. Bits of dirt and rubble began to tumble down into the pit, scaring what little color there was out of the downcast faces of the pitfolk. Nobody moved, nor blinked, nor paid any attention to anything except the growing noise.</p><p>Nobody except for the dancing boy in the center, who was so entranced by his moment that he didn&#x2019;t notice the new stimuli.</p><p>The scratching sounds and falling rubble built into a crescendo, until even Two-Crossed-Fingers couldn&#x2019;t ignore them, but the boy, despite his shock, continued to dance. Who could guess what went through his mind at that time? Whatever it was, he knew that the shadow dance, once initiated, must continue to completion.</p><p>A great Crack! was heard, reverberating around the cavern, and suddenly existence itself shattered &#x2013; or so it seemed to the pitfolk. A great boulder had been dislodged from the opening of the pit, and sunlight poured in at an intensity they had never before experienced. The light was blinding.</p><p>Their eyes watered, their knees buckled, and they all knew that the end was nigh. But Two-Crossed-Fingers continued to dance the bond between good and evil unfurling into chaos. If his eyes began to bleed as he sped up his frantic motions, he did not seem to notice. The boy was possessed by a singular purpose &#x2013; to retell the story of his tribe one final time.</p><p>Faster and faster he danced until the shadows made only a blur on the ground, telling no story at all except in the boy&#x2019;s mind&#x2019;s eye. One by one the muscles in his body gave way, but still he whirled. If anyone had stopped to ask him why he bothered dancing as the world fell apart, that single note of confusion might have broken his trance. But no one paid him any mind, so no stray thoughts entered the boy&#x2019;s head, so Two-Crossed-Fingers danced to the very end.&#xA0;</p><p>As the final sacrifice was thrown into the purifying fire to save humanity from its ultimate doom, he let out a long breath of relief.&#xA0;</p><p>Then everything went white.</p><p>---</p><p>When we opened up the pit, we couldn&#x2019;t believe our eyes. The records clearly showed that a mining accident had sealed the shaft nearly two hundred years ago, and yet when we dug down to its depths, we discovered twenty-three living human beings, cringing and frightened in a circle, thin as sticks. I&#x2019;m proud to say that the team took action rapidly and without hesitation, climbing back up with the pit people strapped to their backs. We herded them like frightened sheep into our trucks, and soon had them in the local hospital.</p><p>What I remember most from that day was one little boy who latched onto me with a vice-like grip. He shook up and down, clearly frightened out of his wits, and a smear of blood ran down the side of his cheek. Yet still there was a line of defiance in his brow.</p><p>The mission itself had to continue, but a few of us volunteered to stay behind with the pit people and take care of their rehabilitation, as the hospital was understaffed for this kind of work. It took many months of intensive care to nurse the pit people back to health. None of them knew any spoken language, but they were surprisingly quick studies, and the programs worked as well as could be expected. Eventually they were able to tell us in simple words their unbelievable tale &#x2013;&#xA0; that all of them, down to the oldest man, had lived in the pit since birth, and never known any other life.</p><p>We tried our best to help the pit people, but it was difficult, for they had been down there so very long. What kept us going was how grateful they were, and they were very expressive of their gratitude with their long, bony limbs. The pit people all agreed that it had been a living nightmare down there in the pit, surviving in some demi-state between life and unlife. The plainest things &#x2013; the green of grass, the ripples on pondwater, the crunch of tires against gravel &#x2013; brought tears of ecstasy to their eyes.</p><p>There was one exception: the youngest among them, a boy who couldn&#x2019;t have been more than eight years old. The same boy who had left such an impression on me that very first day.</p><p>When I was tasked to observe him, I found the boy was grateful and agreeable, but not extraordinarily so. He smiled a distant smile and made odd motions with his arms, often waving his crossed fingers at me as if he was about to lie. But he refused to learn to speak.</p><p>One day, he pulled me away from my lunch break and into his tent. The boy turned the lamp off so that only a thin sliver of light made it through the flap, and proceeded to do the strangest little dance. Even in the darkness, it was such a grotesque and unnatural series of motions to my eyes, joints bent in all the wrong angles, that I reflexively cast my eyes away.&#xA0;</p><p>I think this offended him, and he stopped dead in his tracks.&#xA0;</p><p>Ever since that day, he ignored me and all the other staff entirely, despite my best efforts to help him open up. The boy had no interest in the toys and games that fascinated other children.</p><p>Even so, I held out hope that something would change.</p><p>---</p><p>One chilly winter morning some weeks later, I was woken up by a nurse to learn that the boy had gone missing. There was no trace of him around the camp, and a long rope ladder had disappeared with him.</p><p>Propelled by a sinking feeling in my stomach, I jumped into my truck and quickly drove my way back to the opening of the pit where we first found them. Just as I suspected, a rope ladder fell into the darkness, its ends amateurishly looped around a tree stump nearby.</p><p>After refastening the rope properly, I descended down the ladder, too anxious to go back for proper protective gear. I knew that the boy was at the bottom of the pit, and part of me was already rehearsing for what I would do when I found him. Would I comfort him, or be cross? Would I have to take him back by force?</p><p>As I climbed down, the sounds of life retreated into the distance and the light above faded to a tiny point, but still the bottom was nowhere in sight. I felt as if I was descending into another plane, where time and space and smell and taste all faded into metaphor.</p><p>Finally, my boots hit solid ground. Using my smartphone as a makeshift flashlight, I discovered the same large cavern that we initially found the pit people in. It was about sixty feet across, and almost perfectly circular. The cold stone stretched out flat and empty, devoid of any sign that dozens of people had ever spent their lives here.&#xA0;</p><p>To my surprise, there was not even a single trace of the boy.</p><p>I stood still for a moment, drinking in the emptiness. In the corner of my eye, the shadows on the ground seemed to dance and cavort gracefully, but when I turned to stare at them they steadied.&#xA0;</p><p>It must have been the unsteadiness of my hands.</p><p>Another silhouette flitted across my peripheral vision, but when I turned, there was again nothing.</p><p>I was unsettled.</p><p>I am not a claustrophobic man, but the emptiness, the silence, and the chill in the air made it unbearable to stay too long. All thoughts of the boy disappeared from my mind.</p><p>As soon as my limbs recovered I clambered back up the rope ladder as fast as they would take me, out of this plane of demi-life. The trip upwards seemed to take twice as long as the trip down, and my limbs almost gave way before I made it.</p><p>After returning to the land of the living, I thought for a moment to pull up the rope ladder and take it with me.</p><p>In the end, I decided against it.</p>",alkjash,alkjash,alkjash,

Even more so, <a href=""https://twitter.com/henrifdrake/status/1186811309867831296"">this type of open source analysis</a> is what the field needs to look like. But I had to dig a bit to see even the beginnings of a quantitative picture of how technologies can contribute to <em>solving</em> the problems.</p><p>There are integrative assessments of solutions, such as <a href=""https://www.drawdown.org/"">Project Drawdown</a>, and a huge proliferation of innovative technologies being proposed and developed in all sectors. There are also some <a href=""http://newmaeweb.ucsd.edu/courses/MAE119/WI_2018/ewExternalFiles/Hoffert%20et%20al%20%282002%29%20Advanced%20Technology%20Paths%20to%20Global%20Cl.pdf"">superb review papers</a> that treat the need for new technologies. Bret Victor has a <a href=""http://worrydream.com/ClimateChange/"">beautiful overview</a> emphasizing the role of general design, modeling and implementation capacity, and there is now a <a href=""https://github.com/ron-rivest/MIT-6.S898-climate-change/blob/master/resources.md"">climate change for computer scientists course at MIT</a>. But, as a scientifically literate (PhD in Biophysics) <em>outsider</em> to the climate and energy fields, I was looking to first understand the very <em>basics</em>:</p><ul><li>How can I estimate the world’s remaining carbon budget for various levels of warming? What are the uncertainties in this?</li><li>What would happen if Greenland melted?</li><li>What are the fundamental physical limits on, say, the potential for sucking carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere? How low could the cost theoretically go?</li><li>How many trees would you need to plant, and are you going to run out of water, land or fertilizer for them?</li><li>If we did manage to remove a given amount of CO2, how would the climate respond? How would the climate respond if we magically ceased all emissions today?</li><li>What would be the real impact if we could electrify all cars?</li><li>Are batteries going to be able to store all the variable renewable energy we’ll need? Is there enough Uranium obtainable to power the world with nuclear? Order of magnitude, how much would it cost to just replace our entire energy supply with nuclear?</li><li>Notwithstanding the complexity of their <a href=""https://www.nap.edu/read/18988/chapter/6"">governance</a> and potential <a href=""https://gwagner.com/wp-content/uploads/Wagner-Merk-2019-Moral-Hazard-and-Solar-Geoengineering-brief.pdf"">moral hazard </a>implications, do we have a solid science and engineering basis to believe that any geoengineering methods could theoretically work to <em>controllably</em> lower temperature, and if so, would that be able to slow down sea ice melt, too? Would it damage the ozone layer? How fast could you turn it off? Could it be done locally?</li><li>Etc.</li></ul><p>For questions like those and many others, I want to calculate “on the back on an envelope” an estimate of whether any given idea is definitely crazy, or might just be possible.</p><p>I suspect that a similar desire led the information theory and statistics luminary David MacKay to write his seminal calculation-rich book <a href=""https://www.withouthotair.com/"">Sustainable Energy without the Hot Air</a>. While these blog posts, written over a few vacations and weekends by a more modest intellect, don’t begin to approach MacKay’s standard of excellence, I do hope that they can serve as a breadcrumb trail through the literature that may help others to apply this spirit to a broader set of climate-relevant engineering problems.</p><p>In this first of three posts, I attempt an outsider’s summary of the basic physics/chemistry/biology of the climate system, focused on <em>back of the envelope calculations</em> where possible. At the end, I comment a bit about technological approaches for emissions reductions. Future posts will include a <a href=""https://longitudinal.blog/co2-series-part-2-co2-removal/"">review</a> of the science behind negative emissions technologies, as well as the science (with plenty of caveats, don’t worry) <a href=""https://longitudinal.blog/co2-series-part-3-other-interventions/"">behind</a> more controversial potential solar radiation management approaches. This first post should be very basic for anyone “in the know” about energy, but I wanted to cover the basics before jumping into carbon sequestration technologies.</p><p>(These posts as a whole are admittedly weighted more towards what I perceived to be less-mainstream topics, like carbon capture and geo-engineering. In this first one, while I do briefly cover a lot of cool mitigation techniques — like next-generation renewables storage, a bit about nuclear, and even a bit about the economics of carbon taxes — I don’t try to cover the full spectrum of important technology areas in mitigation and adaptation. But don’t let that leave you with the impression that the <em>principal</em> applications of tech to climate are in CO2 removal and geo-engineering. Areas I don’t cover much here may be <em>even more important and disruptive</em> — like, to name a few, decarbonizing steel and cement production, or novel control systems for solar and wind power, or the use of buildings as smart grid-adaptive power loads, or hydrogen fuel, or improved weather prediction… It just happens that the scope of my <em>particular</em> review here is: some traditional mitigation, a lot of CDR and geo-engineering, and ~nothing in adaptation aspects like public health or disaster relief. Within applications of machine learning to climate, I recommend <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05433"">this paper</a> for a broader picture that spans a wider range of solution domains — such breadth serves as good food for thought for technologists interested in finding the truly most impactful areas in which they might be able to contribute, but I don’t attempt it here.)</p><p>Disclaimers:</p><ol type=""1""><li>I am not a climate scientist or an energy professional. I am just a scientifically literate lay-person on the internet, reading up in my free time. If you are looking for some climate scientists online, I recommend <a href=""https://twitter.com/michael_nielsen/lists/climate/members"">those that Michael Nielsen follows</a>, and <a href=""https://twitter.com/khayhoe/lists/scientists-who-do-climate/members"">this list</a> from <a href=""https://twitter.com/khayhoe"">Prof. Katharine Hayhoe</a>.

You should definitely read the <a href=""https://www.ipcc.ch/"">IPCC reports</a>, as well, and take courses by real climate scientists, like <a href=""https://www.e-education.psu.edu/meteo469/"">this one</a>. The National Academies and various other agencies also often have reports that can claim a much higher degree of expertise and vetting than this one.</li><li>Any views expressed here are mine only and do not reflect any current or former employer. Any errors are also my own. This has not been peer-reviewed in any meaningful sense. If you’re an expert on one of these areas I’ll certainly appreciate and try to incorporate your suggestions or corrections.</li><li>There is not really anything new here — I try to closely follow and review the published literature and the scientific consensus, so at most my breadcrumb trail may serve to make you more aware of what scientists have already told the world in the form of publications.</li><li>I’m focused here on trying to understand the narrowly technical aspects, not on the political aspects, despite those being crucial. This is meant to be a review of the technical literature, not a political statement. I worried that writing a blog purely on the topic of technological intervention in the climate, without attempting or claiming to do justice to the social issues raised, would implicitly suggest that I advocate a narrowly <a href=""https://radicalxchange.org/blog/posts/2019-08-19-bv61r6/"">technocratic</a> or <a href=""http://srconstantin.posthaven.com/against-multilateralism"">unilateral</a> approach, which is not my intention. By focusing on technology, I don’t mean to detract from the importance of the social and policy aspects. I do mention the importance of carbon taxes several times, as possibly necessary to drive the development and adoption of technology. I don’t mean to imply through my emphasis that all solutions are technologically advanced — for example, <a href=""https://www.wysscampaign.org/"">crucial work</a> is happening on conservation of land and biodiversity. That said, I do view advanced technology as a key lever to allow solutions to scale worldwide, at the hundreds-of-gigatonnes-of-CO2 level of impact, in a cost-effective, environmentally and societally benign way. Indeed, the rights kinds of improvements to our energy system are likely one of the best ways to <a href=""https://elidourado.com/blog/move-the-needle-on-progress/"">spur</a> economic <a href=""https://www.econtalk.org/tyler-cowen-on-stubborn-attachments-prosperity-and-the-good-society/"">growth</a>.</li><li>Talking about emerging and future technologies doesn’t mean we shouldn’t be deploying existing decarbonization technologies now. There is a finite cumulative carbon budget to avoid unacceptable levels of warming. A perfect technology that arrives in 2050 doesn’t solve the primary problem.</li><li>For some of the specific technologies discussed, I will give further caveats and arguments in favor of caution in considering deployment.</li></ol><p>Acknowledgements: I got a bunch of good suggestions from friends including Brad Zamft, Sarah Sclarsic, Will Regan, David Pfau, David Brown, David Rolnick, Tom Hunt, Tony Pan, Marcus Sarofim, Michael Nielsen, Sam Rodriques, James Ough, Evan Miyazono, Nick Barry, Kevin Esvelt, Eric Drexler and George Church.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Outline</strong>:</p><ul><li>Introduction</li><li>Basic numbers on climate</li><ul><li>Radiation balance</li><li>Climate sensitivity</li><ul><li>Water vapor</li><li>Ocean biology effects</li><li>Land biology effects</li><li>Permafrost</li></ul><li>Local warming</li><li>The need for detailed simulations</li><li>Trying to ballpark the feedbacks</li><ul><li>Without feedback</li><li>With historical factor of 4</li><li>Potential tipping points</li><li>With 450 ppm ~ 2C middle of the road estimate</li><li>Implications of middle of the road estimate</li></ul></ul><li>Impacts</li><ul><li>Baseline scenarios for sea level rise</li><li>Potential tipping point scenarios for ice melt</li></ul><li>Emissions</li><ul><li>Sectors</li><li>Evaluating some popular ideas: electric cars and less air travel</li><li>A bit about clean electricity, nuclear and the power grid</li><li>How quickly must we decarbonize?</li><li>Carbon tax</li></ul><li>Tentative conclusions</li></ul><h1>Basic numbers on climate</h1><p>Let’s start with crude “back of the envelope” approximations — of a type first <a href=""http://www.rsc.org/images/Arrhenius1896_tcm18-173546.pdf"">done</a> by Svante Arrhenius in 1896, who got the modern numbers <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2005/jun/30/climatechange.climatechangeenvironment2"">basically right</a> — and see how far we get towards understanding <a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-whats-warming-the-world/"">global</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/KHayhoe/status/1032652293659865090"">warming</a> (the phenomenon of CO2-driven warming itself was arguably discovered around 1856 by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eunice_Newton_Foote"">Eunice Foote</a>).

For example, if you want to keep the Earth’s temperature low, you can theoretically increase the albedo, A, to reflect a higher percentage of the incoming solar radiation back to space; this is called solar geoengineering or solar radiation management, and this formula allows to calculate crudely the kind of impact that can have.</p><p>But the formula is <strong>hopelessly oversimplified</strong> for most purposes, e.g., <u>we’ve neglected the fact that much of the heat leaving the Earth’s surface is actually due to</u> <u><a href=""https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/EnergyBalance/page1.php"">evaporation</a>, rather than direct radiation</u>.</p><p><em><strong>A significantly better framework, yet still fully analytical rather than simulation-based, is provided by</strong></em> <em><strong><a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.02695.pdf"">this paper</a></strong></em> <em><strong>(and</strong></em> <em><strong><a href=""http://nadirjeevanjee.com/papers/greenhouse_slides.pdf"">slides</a></strong></em> <em><strong>and</strong></em> <em><strong><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB-SsHGDoD0"">these</a></strong></em> <em><strong><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6mxXk5JvYk"">three</a></strong></em> <em><strong><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjlCXPsnsuk"">videos</a>), but the physics is more involved.&nbsp;</strong></em></p><h2>Climate sensitivity</h2><p>A key further problem for us as back-of-the-envelope-ers, though, is to know what a given amount of CO2 in the atmosphere translates to in terms of <em>effective</em> ε and A (and f) in the above formula. Or in plain English, to relate the amount of atmospheric CO2 to the amount of warming. This is where things get trickier. Before trying to pin down a number for this “climate sensitivity”, let’s first review why doing so is a very complex and multi-factorial problem.</p><h4>Water vapor</h4><p>Naively, if we think of the only effect of CO2 as being the absorption of some of the outgoing infrared thermal radiation from the planet surface, then more CO2 means higher ε, with no change in albedo A. However, in reality, more warming also leads to more water vapor in the atmosphere, which — since <strong>water vapor is itself a greenhouse gas</strong> — can lead to more greenhouse effect and hence more warming, causing a <em>positive feedback</em>. On the other hand, if the extra water vapor forms clouds, that can increase the albedo, decreasing warming by blocking some of the incoming solar radiation from hitting the surface, and leading to a <em>negative feedback</em>. So it doesn’t seem obvious even what functional form the impact of CO2 concentration on ε and A should take, particularly since water vapor can play multiple roles in the translation process.&nbsp;</p><p>If you just consider clouds per se, it looks like they on average cool the Earth, from an experiment described in <a href=""http://web.gps.caltech.edu/classes/ese148a/lecture12.pdf"">lecture 10a of the Caltech intro course</a>, but this depends heavily on their geographic distribution and properties, not to mention their dynamics like heating-induced evaporation, changes in large-scale weather systems, effects specific to the poles, and so on. <strong>Aerosol-cloud interactions, and their effects on albedo and radiative forcing</strong>, appear to be a notable area of limited scientific understanding, and the IPCC reports state this directly. Also, a particular type of cloud called Cirrus actually warms the Earth.</p><p>In general, the feedback effects of water are a key consideration and still imperfectly understood by the field, although the research is making great strides as we speak. For example, just looking at a fairly random sampling of recent papers, it looks like the nature of the water feedback may be such that the Stefan-Boltzmann law calculation above is no longer really appropriate even as an approximation, leading to a <em>linear</em> amount of outgoing radiation with temperature rather than <em>quartic</em> per the Stefan-Boltzmann law</p><p><a href=""https://www.pnas.org/content/115/41/10293"">pnas.org/content/115/41/10293</a></p><p><a href=""https://phys.org/news/2018-09-earth-space.html"">phys.org/news/2018-09-earth-space.html</a></p><p>Even weirder,</p><p><a href=""http://news.mit.edu/2014/global-warming-increased-solar-radiation-1110"">news.mit.edu/2014/global-warming-increased-solar-radiation-1110</a> </p><p><a href=""https://www.pnas.org/content/111/47/16700"">pnas.org/content/111/47/16700</a></p><p>the roles of carbon dioxide and water may be such that the largest warming mechanism is increased <em>penetrance</em> of solar radiation rather than decreased <em>escape</em> of infrared per se. As the article explains:</p><blockquote><em>“In computer modeling of Earth’s climate under elevating CO2 concentrations, the greenhouse gas effect does indeed lead to global warming. Yet something puzzling happens: While one would expect the longwave radiation that escapes into space to decline with increasing CO2, the amount actually begins to rise. At the same time, the atmosphere absorbs more and more incoming solar radiation; it’s this</em> <em><strong>enhanced shortwave absorption</strong></em> <em>that ultimately sustains global warming.”&nbsp;</em></blockquote><p>Note that this paper is meant as an <em>explanation of known phenomena arising inside climate models</em>, <strong>not</strong> as a contradiction of those models.</p><p>So it is complicated. (I don’t mean to over-emphasize these particular papers except to say that people are still discovering core aspects of how the Earth’s energy balance works.)</p><p>Moreover, the feedback effects due to changes associated with water take a <em>long time</em> to manifest, due in part to the large specific heat of water and the large overall heat capacity of the enormous, deep oceans, and in part due to the long residence time of CO2 in the atmosphere. Thus, simply fitting curves for observed temperature versus CO2 concentration on a short timescale around the present time may fail to reflect <strong>long-timescale processes</strong> that will be kicking in over the coming decades, such as feedbacks.&nbsp;</p><h4>Ocean biology effects</h4><p>There are also large ocean biology and chemistry effects. Just to list a few, dissolved carbon impacts the acidity of the ocean, which in turn impacts its ability to uptake more carbon from the atmosphere. There are also major ocean <em>biological</em> effects from photosynthesis and the drivers of it. As the Caltech course <a href=""http://web.gps.caltech.edu/classes/ese148a/lecture16.pdf"">explains</a>:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><em>“On longer time scales (decade to century), atmospheric CO2 is strongly influenced by mixing of deep ocean water to the surface. Although deep water is generally supersaturated with respect to even the modern atmosphere, mixing of these water masses to the surface tends to draw down atmospheric CO2 in the end as the high nutrients stimulate formation of organic carbon. Several coupled atmosphere-ocean models have shown, however, that global warming is accompanied by an increase in vertical stratification within the ocean and therefore reduced vertical mixing. On its own, this effect would tend to reduce the ocean CO2 uptake. However, changes in stratification may also drive changes in the natural carbon cycle. The</em> <em><strong>magnitude and even the sign of changes in the natural cycle are much more difficult to predict because of the complexity of ocean biological processes</strong>…”.&nbsp;Indeed, the Caltech slides invoke localized mixing effects in parts of the ocean, and their impact on ocean photosynthesis, as a possible explanation for major pre-industrial temperature changes on inter-glacial timescales.&nbsp;</em></blockquote><h4>Land biology effects</h4><p>There are also <a href=""https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2006GL026972"">terrestrial biological effects</a>. We’ll use the great physicist Freeman Dyson’s emphasis on these as a jumping off point to discuss them. (Dyson is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeman_Dyson#Climate_change"">known</a> as a bit of a “heretic” on climate and many other topics. Here are <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs1jGsn61p8&amp;list=PLVV0r6CmEsFzDA6mtmKQEgWfcIu49J4nN"">157 interviews</a> with him. We won’t dwell on his opinions about what’s good for the world, just on the technical questions he asked about the biosphere, because the history is cool.) In 1977, in a paper that will come up again for us in the context of carbon sequestration technologies, Dyson <a href=""https://adamant.typepad.com/seitz/files/Dyson_Energy_1977.pdf"">pointed out</a> that the yearly photosynthetic turnover of CO2, with carbon going into the bodies of plants and then being released back into the atmosphere through respiration and decay, is &gt;10x yearly industrial emissions. The biological turnover is <strong>almost exactly in balance over a year, but not perfectly so at any location and instant of time</strong>. The slight imbalances over time give the yearly oscillation in the Keeling curve:</p><span><figure><img src=""https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/NR-kbzLMbxl5OegjnOzYFZWHmwDmGprPgWCtjRBCYP-wJLMLOdkDYfGzrq7Wz0JVCQDnNJkMB8tRxK98KuXAqpGvpOzBJRyIoKRm_ve9br3mMurs-EGWfdTzOmkwNGt5Syly1QMM"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:420%""></figure><em><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keeling_Curve#/media/File:Mauna_Loa_CO2_monthly_mean_concentration.svg"">Source: Wikipedia</a></em></span><p>Recently, <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/nature10421"">this paper</a> measured the specifics, concluding “<strong>150–175 petagrams of carbon per year</strong>” of <strong>photosynthesis</strong>, whereas global emissions are roughly ~10 petagrams (gigatonnes) of carbon each year (~40 of CO2). (Here as everywhere I’m going to ignore the<a href=""http://www.onlineconversion.com/faq_09.htm""> small difference</a> between long and short tons and metric tons, i.e., tonnes). This is just for the land, while the <a href=""https://twitter.com/Dorothee_Bakker/status/1140937269395763200"">oceans</a> do about the same amount — see the diagram of the overall carbon cycle below. The influx into the ocean is in part just due to CO2 dissolving in the water, but a significant part of the long-term sequestration of carbon into the <em>deep</em> ocean is <a href=""http://multi-faceted%20particle%20pumps%20drive%20carbon%20sequestration%20in%20the%20ocean/"">due</a> to settling of biological material under gravity and <a href=""https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-04/uor-nvo042519.php"">other</a> mechanisms.</p><p>Dyson stressed that any <strong>net imbalances</strong> that arise in this process, e.g., due to “CO2 fertilization” effects — which cause increased growth rate or mass of plant matter with higher available atmospheric CO2 concentration — could exert large effects. Note that biology may have once <a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azolla_event"">caused an ice age</a>. Dyson <a href=""https://www.edge.org/conversation/freeman_dyson-heretical-thoughts-about-science-and-society"">goes</a> <a href=""https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2008/06/12/the-question-of-global-warming/"">on</a> to discuss potential ways to tip the balance of this large swing towards <em>net</em> fixation, rather than full turnover, which he suggests to do via a plant growing program — we’ll discuss this in relation to biology-based carbon sequestration concepts later on.</p><p>Measurements of CO2 fertilization of land plants have improved since Dyson was writing, e.g., <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-019-0436-1"">this paper</a>, which gives a value: “…0.64 ± 0.28 PgC yr−1&nbsp;per hundred ppm of eCO2. Extrapolating worldwide, this… <em>projects the global terrestrial carbon sink to increase by 3.5 ± 1.9 PgC yr−1&nbsp;for an increase in CO2&nbsp;of 100 ppm</em>“. That is pretty small compared to emissions.</p><p>It seems like the size of the CO2 fertilization effect is limited by <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-019-0545-2"">nutrient availability</a>, as <a href=""https://twitter.com/gcarbonproject/status/1158815001597161474"">is</a> much normal forest growth. The historical effect of CO2 fertilization on growth in a specific tree type is measured <a href=""https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2019/01/31/1816686116"">here</a>, finding large impact on water use efficiency, but little on actual growth of mass. Another recent paper found that CO2 uptake by land plants may be facing limitations related to soil moisture variability, and “suggests that the increasing trend in carbon uptake rate may not be sustained past the middle of the century and could result in accelerated atmospheric CO2 growth”.</p><p>This diagram (a bit out of date on the exact numbers) summarizes the overall pattern of ongoing fluxes in the carbon cycle</p><span><figure><img src=""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/RlbQrn39C49hdOERz2Z48770XWMBbjxjei_J2nyGyH1NslKBdZeU723O2ZWyhORJ3Q8Sf5KHPLiRz6XBdVGjNNqZSU5mpddfvwJyyGWT2C8cbtHeWo5yx9ioCwehZ42P2N-GybgT"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:476%""></figure><em><a href=""http://science.nasa.gov/earth-science/oceanography/ocean-earth-system/ocean-carbon-cycle"">Source: NASA</a></em></span><p>and here is a <a href=""https://twitter.com/RARohde/status/1131224330241806337"">nice animation</a> of this over time as emissions due to human activity have rapidly increased.</p><p>Dyson <a href=""https://www.edge.org/conversation/freeman_dyson-heretical-thoughts-about-science-and-society"">bemoans</a> our lack of knowledge of long-timescale ecological effects of CO2 changes on plant life, e.g.,&nbsp;writing:</p><blockquote><em>“Greenhouse experiments show that many plants growing in an atmosphere enriched with carbon dioxide react by</em> <em>increasing their root-to-shoot ratio. This means that the plants put more of their growth into roots and less into stems and leaves. A change in this direction is to be expected, because the plants have to maintain a balance between the leaves collecting carbon from the air and the roots collecting mineral nutrients from the soil.</em> <em><strong>The enriched atmosphere tilts the balance so that the plants need less leaf-area and more root-area.</strong></em> <em>Now consider what happens to the roots and shoots when the growing season is over, when the leaves fall and the plants die. The new-grown biomass decays and is eaten by fungi or microbes. Some of it returns to the atmosphere and some of it is converted into topsoil. On the average, more of the above-ground growth will return to the atmosphere and more of the below-ground growth will become topsoil. So the plants with increased root-to-shoot ratio will cause an increased transfer of carbon from the atmosphere into topsoil. If the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide due to fossil-fuel burning has caused an increase in the average root-to-shoot ratio of plants over large areas, then the possible effect on the top-soil reservoir will not be small.</em> <em><strong>At present we have no way to measure or even to guess the size of this effect.</strong></em> <em>The aggregate biomass of the topsoil of the planet is not a measurable quantity. But the fact that the topsoil is unmeasurable does not mean that it is unimportant.”&nbsp;</em></blockquote><p>Here is a paper on how we <a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.14815"">can</a> indeed measure the soil carbon content. Dyson further discusses important measurements <a href=""https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/199905/backpage.cfm"">here</a> (already 20 years ago), including on <strong>biosphere-atmosphere fluxes</strong>, and I believe one of the projects he is mentioning is at least somewhat similar to <a href=""https://daac.ornl.gov/cgi-bin/dataset_lister.pl?p=9"">this one called FLUXNET</a>.</p><h4>Permafrost</h4><p>There are other large <strong>potential</strong> feedback effects, beyond those due to water vapor or plant life, e.g., over 1000 gigatonnes of carbon trapped in the arctic <a href=""https://nsidc.org/cryosphere/frozenground/methane.html"">tundra</a>, particularly in the form of the <strong>greenhouse gas</strong> <strong><a href=""https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10666-011-9287-x"">methane</a></strong> <strong>which exerts much stronger</strong> <strong><a href=""https://twitter.com/Peters_Glen/status/1171687464785850368"">short term</a></strong> <strong>effects</strong> than carbon, and which could be <a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1600-0889.2011.00527.x"">released</a> due to thawing of the permafrost.&nbsp;(Eli Dourado <a href=""https://elidourado.com/blog/dawn-of-geoengineering/"">covers</a> the fascinating Pleistocene Park project which aims to influence this.) <a href=""https://twitter.com/gcarbonproject/status/1157546641865543680"">Wildfires</a> are also relevant here. (Apparently recent Russian policy used to think of climate change as mostly a good thing until it became <a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-09-29/climate-change-russia-s-oil-and-gas-heartlands-are-under-threat"">clear</a> that the permafrost is at risk.)</p><h4>Local warming</h4><p>Dyson also <a href=""https://www.edge.org/conversation/freeman_dyson-heretical-thoughts-about-science-and-society"">emphasizes</a> the importance of local measurements, for instance:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><em>“In humid air, the effect of carbon dioxide on radiation transport is unimportant because the transport of thermal radiation is already blocked by the much larger greenhouse effect of water vapor. The effect of carbon dioxide is important where the air is dry, and air is usually dry only where it is cold. Hot desert air may feel dry but often contains a lot of water vapor. The warming effect of carbon dioxide is strongest where air is cold and dry, mainly in the arctic rather than in the tropics, mainly in mountainous regions rather than in lowlands, mainly in winter rather than in summer, and mainly at night rather than in daytime. The warming is real, but it is mostly making cold places warmer rather than making hot places hotter.

Today, the CO2 concentration is around <strong>408.02 ppm</strong>.</p><p>(1 part per million of atmospheric CO2 is equivalent to 2.13 Gigatonnes of Carbon (not of CO2). So a pre-industrial level of 280 ppm is ~600 gigatonnes of Carbon, whereas our current level corresponds to 869.04 gigatonnes of Carbon, and doubling the preindustrial CO2 in the atmosphere, or 278 * 2 ~ 560 ppm, corresponds to about 1193 gigatonnes of Carbon.

A bit more precisely, <u>adding more CO2 to the atmosphere causes the</u> <u><em>height</em></u> <u>at which successful emission into space occurs to move higher</u>, and hence colder, and hence *less*. <a href=""https://www.skepticalscience.com/argument.php?a=82&amp;p=7"">It intuitively does</a>, which this wonderful <a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.02695.pdf"">paper</a> explains from the perspective of <em>convection</em> in the atmosphere: “the planetary energy balance is not purely radiative but is mediated by convection, with water vapor as the key middleman”.</p><p><a href=""https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=(0.3+Kelvins+per+(watt+per+meter+squared))+*+(5.35+watts+per+meter+squared)+*+ln(408%2F279)"">Plugging</a> in our current 408 ppm to the above logarithmic formula, we get 0.6K of warming from pre-industrial times, versus around 1K observed in actual reality. A doubling of pre-industrial CO2 would then <a href=""https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=(0.3+Kelvins+per+(watt+per+meter+squared))+*+(5.35+watts+per+meter+squared)+*+ln(560%2F279)"">lead</a> to about 1.1K of warming in this no-feedback toy model — not so bad. Alas, this is wrong — remember that we’ve left out the feedback.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>With a historical estimate of feedback:</strong></p><p>However, importantly, as the ACS website emphasizes, the formula we just used, which doesn’t take into account any kind of water vapor or biological feedbacks, for example, not to mention many others, <strong>under-estimates certain longer-timescale historical data</strong>, taken from a <a href=""http://science.sciencemag.org/content/291/5501/112"">record</a> that spans over tens of thousands of years, by about a factor of about 4.</p><p>As the ACS website puts it:</p><blockquote><em>“our calculated temperature change, that includes only the radiative forcing from increases in greenhouse gas concentrations, accounts for 20-25% of this observed temperature increase. This result implies a climate sensitivity factor [the term out front of the logarithmic expression for temperature change versus CO2 concentration]</em> <em><strong>perhaps four to five times greater, ∼1.3 K·(W·m–2)–1, than obtained by simply balancing the radiative forcing of the greenhouse gases</strong>. The analysis based only on greenhouse gas forcing has not accounted for</em> <em><a href=""https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/climatescience/atmosphericwarming/forcingandfeedback.html"">feedbacks</a></em> <em>in the planetary system triggered by increasing temperature, including</em> <em><a href=""https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/climatescience/atmosphericwarming/radiativeforcing.html"">changes in the structure of the atmosphere</a>.”</em></blockquote><p>So what happens if we put in the missing factor of 4? Then the formula will be:</p><p><code>temperature_increase_from_preindustrial_levels&nbsp;</code></p><p><code>=</code> <code><strong>4</strong></code> <code>* [0.3 Kelvin per (Watt per meter squared)]&nbsp;</code></p><p><code>* (5.35 Watt per meter squared)&nbsp;</code></p><p><code>* ln([CO2 concentration in ppm]/278)</code></p><p>This <a href=""https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Plot+4*+0.3+*+5.35++*+Ln%28x%2F278%29+between+278+and+500"">looks</a> like,</p><span><figure><img src=""https://i0.wp.com/longitudinal.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-17-at-6.30.13-PM.png?fit=1024%2C705&amp;ssl=1"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:519%""></figure></span><p>Then, even at our <em>current</em> ~408 ppm CO2 concentration, we would <a href=""https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=4+*+(0.3+Kelvins+per+(watt+per+meter+squared))+*+(5.35+watts+per+meter+squared)+*+ln(408%2F279)"">expect</a>&nbsp;2.4K of warming to <em>ultimately</em> (once the slow feedbacks catch up) occur, relative to pre-industrial times, if the missing factor of 4 is needed.</p><p>Now, this is much more warming than has occurred <em>so far</em>. What to make of that? Well, as mentioned above, the water-based feedback phenomena <strong>can take decades to manifest</strong> (given for instance the large heat capacity of the oceans), so perhaps we should not be surprised that <em>the temperature of the Earth has not yet caught up with where it is going to be heading over the coming decades</em>, even for a hypothetical <em>fixed</em> amount of CO2 from now on, according to this formula.&nbsp;</p><p>(Interestingly, researchers have now measured, using a sophisticated tool called the <a href=""https://www.ssec.wisc.edu/aeri/"">Atmospheric Emitted Radiance Interferometer</a>, the raw CO2 forcing over “clear sky”, i.e., <em>without</em> much of the long term or cloud related water vapor feedbacks, and found a CO2 forcing of around 1.82 W/meter^2, which <strong>accords decently well</strong> with what we get when we plug around 400 ppm CO2 into (5.35 Watt per meter squared) * ln([CO2]/278), namely (5.35 Watt per meter squared) * ln(400/278) = 1.95 W/meter^2. Unfortunately this can’t tell us whether the “missing factor of 4” is indeed 4 or some other number — this is just the forcing from CO2 without water vapor effects.)</p><p>If true, i.e., if the (for instance) water feedbacks are indeed slow and positive to the point where the “missing factor of 4” is in fact needed to calculate the ultimate temperature impact, then even with the amount of CO2 that we’ve <em>already</em> emitted things are <strong>not good</strong>. Note that if CO2 concentration were (sometime later this century) to double from pre-industrial levels, in a model including this additional factor of 4, we’d have an average surface warming of about 4.5K above pre-industrial levels. That would be <strong>really not good</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>A <a href=""https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2013JD020184"">recent paper</a> tried to pin down the magnitude of the water feedback based on more recent, rather than long-term historical, observations, including measurements of the water vapor concentration itself:</p><blockquote><em>“the availability of atmospheric profiles of water vapor and temperature from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) has made direct estimates of the water vapor feedback possible”. They concluded that they could not perfectly estimate the vapor feedback without observations over a longer timescale than the 7 year long dataset they used, perhaps closer to 25 years: “The errors associated with this calculation, associated primarily with the shortness of our observational time series, suggest that the long‐term water vapor feedback lies between 1.9 and 2.8 Wm−2K−1. The source of error from the relatively short time period is about three times as large as other error sources…. Thus,</em> <em><strong>our results strengthen the case for a significantly positive feedback from water vapor changes in the climate system, which, acting alone, would</strong></em> <em><strong><u>double the magnitude of any warming forced by increasing greenhouse gas concentrations</u></strong>.”</em></blockquote><p>So it sounds like they come out with roughly a factor of 2, rather than a factor of 4, for the effect of the water vapor feedback itself. Still not fantastic.</p><h4>Potential tipping points</h4><p>Alas, fitting historical or even quite recent data for the “missing feedback factor” isn’t really fully predictive either, even if we had enough of that data, due to abrupt phase transitions or <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tipping_points_in_the_climate_system"">tipping points</a> which can occur at different temperatures. For example, rapid one-time arctic methane release from the permafrost, or ocean albedo decrease brought on by sea ice melting.&nbsp;Some have <a href=""https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0081648"">argued</a> that a nominal 2C target, given comparatively fast feedbacks like water vapor, actually corresponds to a nearly inexorable push to 3C or higher long-term when slower feedbacks are taken into account.</p><p>To be sure, many seem to disagree that the relevant tipping points are likely to be around 2C, as opposed to higher, as explained <a href=""https://twitter.com/DoctorVive/status/1170816281794293761"">here</a>. Here is a <a href=""https://twitter.com/KHayhoe/status/1104833329587806210"">nice thread</a> about the significance or lack thereof of current targets like 2C or 1.5C from a tipping point perspective. Also, many tipping points would take decades or centuries to manifest their effects, giving time for response, and in some cases in principle for reversal by bringing temperature back down through negative emissions.</p><p>But on the more worrisome side, I have seen plenty of papers and analyses that do point to the potential for major tipping points / bi-stabilities around 2C, or sometimes even less. For example, this <a href=""https://www.pnas.org/content/115/33/8252"">paper</a> uses 2C as a rough estimate of the temperature that you don’t want to exceed for risk of hitting a potential <em>cascade</em> of major tipping points. Likewise <a href=""https://www.yaleclimateconnections.org/2018/02/the-permafrost-bomb-is-ticking/"">this analysis </a>points to potential tipping points in arctic permafrost methane release at even lower temperatures. (Also, we should probably worry about nonlinear effects that would depend on the <em>rate</em> of change of climate variables, for instance if ecologies can adapt to a given change over long timescales but struggle to do so over short timescales, and about the fact that some tipping point effects may not depend on average values of variables but on their peak values or variances.)</p><p>(As a side note, separate from “tipping points” in the climate system as a whole, you may have heard about dynamical chaos in the weather. These are two totally different issues, both related to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycJEoqmQvwg"">nonlinear dynamics</a>. Chaotic dynamics governing the specifics of weather in any particular “run” of the climate system, or particular run of a model thereof, is totally consistent with predictable and bounded trends in <em>average</em> weather, i.e., climate. This is <a href=""http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2008/04/butterflies-tornadoes-and-climate-modelling/"">beautifully explained here</a> in reference to the canonical introductory example of chaos, the Lorentz attractor — in short, their analogy is that if <em>weather</em> is like any particular <em>trajectory</em> of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system"">Lorentz system</a>, unpredictable beyond a few weeks without exponentially more precise measurement of initial conditions, then <em>climate</em> is like the <em>overall shape and size</em> of the Lorentz attractor as a whole, on which all those trajectories must lie. By averaging enough trajectories, you can start to understand aspects of that overall shape, which is what climate simulations do.)</p><p>Thus, we can start to see a <em>very rough qualitative picture</em> of the range of uncertainties. Nobody can <em>perfectly</em> pin down the exact climate sensitivity at the moment. But it is also now hopefully clear roughly where the estimates we see are coming from, and why they make sense given what is known.</p><h4>A middle of the road climate sensitivity</h4><p>For comparison, using<a href=""https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-009-9792-y""> sophisticated climate models, plus models of the human activity</a>, IPCC <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Future-projections-of-climate-change-copied-from-the-IPCC-Synthesis-Report-IPCC_fig38_265041566"">projects</a> 2-4K of warming by 2100.

Indeed, in scenarios with large abrupt tipping points this would certainly not be the case. You do, however, get something similar to this description when you linearize simple ordinary differential equation models for the planetary energy balance, by assuming a small perturbation around a given temperature — this is <a href=""http://www.atmos.albany.edu/facstaff/brose/classes/ATM623_Spring2015/Notes/Lectures/Lecture03%20--%20Climate%20sensitivity%20and%20feedback.html"">treated here</a>. The site just linked arrives at a temperature perturbation deltaT ~ -R/lambda, where R is the radiative forcing and lambda is a feedback factor that arises from the linearization. In their analysis, they get lambda = −3.3&nbsp;W&nbsp;m^-2&nbsp;K^-1 due to just the direct effects of the CO2 forcing and blackbody radiation (called Planck forcing) and lambda = -1.3&nbsp;W&nbsp;m^-2&nbsp;K^-1 in a middle of the road IPCC climate sensitivity estimate: I think it is not coincidental here that -3.3/-1.3 ~ 2.5, which is the same as our “missing feedback factor” for the IPCC climate sensitivity estimate just above. In any case, the analysis <a href=""http://www.atmos.albany.edu/facstaff/brose/classes/ATM623_Spring2015/Notes/Lectures/Lecture03%20--%20Climate%20sensitivity%20and%20feedback.html"">here</a> gives a more rigorous definition of feedback factors in linearized models and how to break them down into components due to different causes.)</p><p>We can also try to crudely translate this into the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transient_climate_response_to_cumulative_carbon_emissions"">TCRE</a> measure used in the IPCC reports. For us as back of the envelopers, I think this basically treats the logarithmic curve as linear over the range of interest, which you can see by looking at the curves above is not so far from the truth. If we use 450 ppm for 2C, then our TCRE is 2.7C/1000PgC, whereas if we use 480 ppm for 2C it is 2.34C/1000PgC, and <a href=""https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%282Kelvins%2F%282*%28530-278%29*7.81%29%29*1000*3.7"">if we use 530 ppm for 2C it is 1.9C/1000PgC</a>. The IPCC <a href=""https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/2/2019/02/SR15_Chapter2_Low_Res.pdf"">states</a> (based on statistically aggregating results of complex simulations and so forth) a likely range for the TCRE of 0.8 to 2.5C/1000PgC with a best observational estimate of 1.35C/1000PgC, suggesting that our feedback factor of 2.5 may be a bit high and a <a href=""https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Plot+2*+0.3+*+5.35++*+Ln%28x%2F278%29+between+278+and+540"">feedback factor of 2</a> may be more appropriate as a middle of the range estimate.</p><h4>Implications of the middle of the road climate sensitivity for carbon budgets</h4><p>What would this particular curve (used for illustration only, since any real treatment has to be probabilistic, and this model is extremely crude, see the IPCC reports for better), with the “feedback factor” of 2.5, imply for the hypothetical scenario where we abruptly <em>ceased</em> emissions quite soon?</p><p>Per the curve, we’d still potentially be <a href=""https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2.5*+0.3+*+5.35++*+Ln%28410%2F278%29"">looking at</a> around 1.5C of ultimate warming (due to feedbacks), with roughly our <em>current</em> atmospheric CO2 levels kept <em>constant</em>.</p><p>With the <a href=""https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Plot+2*+0.3+*+5.35++*+Ln%28x%2F278%29+between+278+and+540"">feedback factor of 2</a> instead of 2.5, we’d cross 1.5C at around 440 ppm, and our remaining carbon budget for 1.5C at the time of writing would therefore be around 2*(440-405 ppm)*7.81=547GtCO2 emitted.</p><p>For comparison, one <a href=""https://unfccc.int/files/meetings/sb26/side_events_and_exhibits/application/pdf/070512_ipcc_stott.pdf"">figure</a> I’ve seen (see slide 15 there) gives around 0.1C per decade of additional warming even under year 2000 atmospheric <em>CO2</em> <em><strong>levels</strong></em> kept <strong>constant</strong>, although <a href=""http://www.easterbrook.ca/steve/2013/02/how-big-is-the-climate-change-deficit/"">another analysis</a> suggests roughly constant temperature (little further warming) if carbon <strong>emissions</strong> were to completely and abruptly <strong>cease</strong> — these are not inconsistent, since if emissions somehow <em>completely</em> ceased, natural carbon <u>sinks</u> could start to kick in to <em>slowly</em> decrease atmospheric CO2, which is not the same as holding CO2 <em>concentrations</em> constant. See more good discussion <a href=""https://twitter.com/KenCaldeira/status/1031706974361010176"">here</a> and <a href=""https://twitter.com/Peters_Glen/status/1185632577316634625"">here</a>. It is not obvious to me a priori that some fixed amount of CO2 added to the atmosphere would be naturally removed, on net, at all, even on long timescales… a carbon cycle could in principle keep atmospheric CO2 at a stable level that simply happens to be higher than the pre-industrial concentration. But according to a nice discussion <a href=""https://www.nap.edu/read/25259/chapter/3#33"">in the introduction to the NAS report on negative emissions</a>, the sinks are real and active, and indeed once human emissions fall <em>low enough</em>, not even necessarily to zero, the sinks can bring the rate of change of atmospheric CO2 concentration to net negative:</p><blockquote><em>“…atmospheric concentration declines… despite net anthropogenic emissions of 164 Gt CO2 during the same period (fossil and land use minus NET), because the land and ocean carbon sinks take up 196+164 Gt CO2… the sinks are expected to persist for more than a century of declining CO2&nbsp;because of the continued disequilibrium uptake by the long-lived carbon pools in the ocean and terrestrial biosphere. For example, to reduce atmospheric CO2&nbsp;from 450 to 400 ppm, it would not be necessary to create net negative anthropogenic emissions equal to the net positive historical emissions that caused the concentration to increase from 400 to 450 ppm. The persistent disequilibrium uptake by the land and ocean carbon sinks would allow for achievement of this reduction even with net positive anthropogenic emissions during the 50 ppm decline”</em></blockquote><p>Anyway, loosely speaking (see <a href=""https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-how-much-carbon-budget-is-left-to-limit-global-warming-to-1-5c"">here</a> for a much better analysis), from what I’ve understood, in the absence of large-scale deployment of negative emissions technology, it seems <em>unlikely</em> that we have more than 10 years of emissions <em>at current levels</em> while still having a <em>high likelihood</em> of not exceeding a 1.5C peak warming, given what we know now. That’s ~400 GigaTonnes CO2 for the 10 years, versus a budget of roughly zero for a feedback factor of 2.5 and roughly 550GtCO2 for a feedback factor of 2 as estimated above. There is a <em>chance</em> we’ve already committed to 1.5C peak warming, in the absence of large-scale negative emissions, regardless of what else we do.</p><p>Interestingly, even some of the scenarios that target 1.5C set that as an ultimate target for the end of the century, and actually slightly <a href=""https://twitter.com/Peters_Glen/status/1174955265679953921"">exceed</a> that target between now and then, relying on negative emissions to bring it down afterwards. This <a href=""https://twitter.com/JoeriRogelj/status/1174736029678542849"">recent</a> <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1541-4.epdf"">Nature</a> paper explains clearly why and how not to think that way: we need to make our near-term action more stringent to constrain the peak, and the timing of the peak, not just a long-term target.</p><p>With all that in mind, here are two snippets from the <a href=""https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/2/2019/02/SR15_Chapter2_Low_Res.pdf"">IPCC report</a> on 1.5C (written over a year ago so the carbon budget is roughly 40-80 GtCO2 less now). The left hand snippet expresses the level of uncertainty in the remaining carbon budget for 1.5C, and the right snippet mentions the need for negative emissions in real-world scenarios where we stabilize to 1.5C. Their 420-580 GtCO2 budget from a year or so ago accords decently well with what we got (zero to 550 GtCO2) from the feedback factor of 2-2.5 case above.</p><span><figure><img src=""https://i2.wp.com/longitudinal.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-03-at-11.05.13-PM.png?fit=1024%2C463&amp;ssl=1"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:91%""></figure><em><a href=""https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/2/2019/02/SR15_Chapter2_Low_Res.pdf"">https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/2/2019/02/SR15_Chapter2_Low_Res.pdf</a></em></span><p><a href=""https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/2/2019/02/SR15_Chapter2_Low_Res.pdf"">https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/2/2019/02/SR15_Chapter2_Low_Res.pdf</a></p><p>We can also ballpark (again, subject to all the caveats about the notion of carbon budgets <a href=""https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-how-much-carbon-budget-is-left-to-limit-global-warming-to-1-5c"">here</a>, not to mention our crappiest of models) a remaining carbon budget for 2C warming using the 450 ppm ~ 2C idea. 450 ppm ~ 3514 GigaTonnes of CO2 in the atmosphere, versus ~3163 (405 ppm) up there now, so we would be allowed to add around 300 or 350 more. So if the oceans and land plants absorb 1/2 of what we emit (bad for ocean acidification), the maximum carbon budget for 2C in this very particular scenario is around 2*(3514-3163) GigaTonnes CO2 = 702 GigaTonnes of emitted CO2 if there are no negative emissions.

Note that the rise at certain coastal areas will be higher than the global average. <a href=""https://www.pnas.org/content/113/47/13342"">This paper</a> provides some specifics:</p><blockquote><em>“By 2040, with a 2 °C warming under the RCP8.5 scenario, more than 90% of coastal areas will experience sea level rise exceeding the global estimate of 0.2 m, with up to 0.4 m expected along the Atlantic coast of North America and Norway. With a 5 °C rise by 2100, sea level will rise rapidly, reaching 0.9 m (median), and 80% of the coastline will exceed the global sea level rise at the 95th percentile upper limit of 1.8 m. Under RCP8.5, by 2100, New York may expect rises of 1.09 m, Guangzhou may expect rises of 0.91 m, and Lagos may expect rises of 0.90 m, with the 95th percentile upper limit of 2.24 m, 1.93 m, and 1.92 m, respectively.”</em></blockquote><h4>Implications of potential tipping points in ice melt</h4><p>The above plots of mean/expected sea level rise do <strong>not</strong> strongly reflect specific, apparently-much-less-likely scenarios in which we would see catastrophic tipping-point collapse of the Arctic or Antarctic ice.</p><p>To be up front, I have limited understanding of how likely this is to happen and what the real implications would be. But to try to understand this, it looks helpful to separate major sources of sea level rise due to ice melt into at least four groups:</p><ul><li>Sea ice (Arctic and Antarctic)</li><li>Greenland ice sheet</li><li>West Antarctic ice sheet</li><li>East Antarctic ice sheet</li></ul><p>We are already seeing significant<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_sea_ice_decline""> loss of summer sea ice in the Arctic</a>. In Antarctica, the sea ice normally <a href=""https://www.pnas.org/content/106/49/20590"">doesn’t survive in summer</a>, but loss of the winter sea ice could significantly disrupt ocean circulation.</p><p>If Greenland melted in full, <a href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-is-worldwide-sea-level-rise-driven-by-melting-arctic-ice/"">sea level would rise around 7 meters</a>.</p><p>If <em>West</em> Antarctica melted in full, we’d be seeing <a href=""http://www.antarcticglaciers.org/question/ice-antarctica-melt-much-global-sea-level-rise-quickly-likely-happen/"">several meters</a> of sea level rise.</p><p>If all of Antarctica, including the comparatively-likely-to-be-stable East Antarctica, melted we’d be seeing <a href=""https://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/earth/geophysics/question473.htm"">perhaps &gt; 60 meters</a> of sea level rise.</p><p>(Sea level also rises with rising temperature just due to thermal expansion of water, as opposed to ice melt.)</p><p>Ideally ice melt would go slowly, e.g., a century or more, giving some time to respond with things like negative emissions technologies (<a href=""https://longitudinal.blog/co2-series-part-2-co2-removal/"">next post</a>) and perhaps some temperature stabilization via solar geo-engineering (next next post). But from my understanding, it is at least <em>conceivable</em> that it could happen in just a couple of decades, for instance if a series of major tipping points in positive feedbacks are crossed, e.g., methane release en masse from the permafrost. For comparison, the city of Manhattan is 10 meters above sea level.</p><p>Now, a question for each of these is whether they can be <em>reversible</em>, if we brought back the temperature via removal of CO2 or via solar radiation management.</p><p>We know that there is a weak form of what could be called “effective irreversibility by emissions reduction” in the sense that the climate has inertia, so that if we simply greatly reduced emissions, it might be too late — a self-reinforcing process of warming and sea ice melt could have already set in due to positive feedbacks. For instance, as ice melts, ocean albedo lowers, melting more ice. Moreover, we’ve already discussed that there are water vapor feedbacks that take time to warm the planet fully once CO2 has been added to the atmosphere. Thus, we can effectively lock in ongoing future sea level rise with actions that are happening or already have happened. This seems to be a concept used frequently in popular discussions of this topic, i.e., people ask “is it already too late to stop sea level rise by limiting emissions”.</p><p>But there is also a stronger notion of irreversibility — if we used negative emissions or solar radiation management to restore current temperatures, would we also restore current ice formations?</p><p>In one 2012 modeling paper called “<a href=""https://www.the-cryosphere.net/6/193/2012/tc-6-193-2012.pdf"">How reversible is sea ice loss</a>“, the authors concluded that: “Against global mean temperature, Arctic sea ice area is reversible, while the Antarctic sea ice shows some asymmetric behaviour – its rate of change slower, with falling temperatures, than its rate of change with rising temperatures. However, we show that the asymmetric behaviour is driven by hemispherical differences in temperature change between transient and stabilisation periods. <em><strong>We find no irreversible behaviour in the sea ice cover</strong></em>“. In other words, if you can bring the temperature back down, you can bring back the sea ice, in this study, with some delay depending on how exactly you bring down the temperature. But this is just one modeling study.</p><p>Another paper called “<a href=""https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2011GL048739"">The reversibility of sea ice loss in a state-of-the-art climate model</a>“, concludes similarly for the sea ice as such:</p><blockquote><em>“The lack of evidence for critical sea ice thresholds within a state-of-the-art GCM implies that future sea ice loss will occur only insofar as global warming continues, and may be fully reversible. This is ultimately an encouraging conclusion; although some future warming is inevitable [e.g., Armour and Roe, 2011], in the event that greenhouse gas emissions are reduced sufficiently for the climate to cool back to modern hemispheric-mean temperatures,</em> <em><strong>a sea ice cover similar to modern-day is expected to follow</strong>.”</em></blockquote><p>So maybe the sea ice cover, as such, is reversible with temperature — albeit with a <em>delay</em>: their notion of reversibility is defined in a simulation that unfolds over multiple centuries!</p><p>But, perhaps even more worryingly, this doesn’t tell us anything about reversibility of Greenland or West or East Antarctica melt: this is ice that rests on land of some kind, as opposed to ice that arises from freezing in the open seas. In fact, the second reversibility study says: “our findings are expected to be most relevant to the assessment of sea ice thresholds under transient warming over the next few centuries <strong>in the absence of substantial land ice sheet changes</strong>“.</p><p>A <a href=""https://www.pnas.org/content/106/49/20590"">paper in PNAS provides</a> a relatively simple model and states:</p><blockquote><em>“We also discuss why, in contrast to Arctic summer sea ice,</em> <em><u>a tipping point is more likely to exist for the loss of the Greenland ice sheet and the West Antarctic ice sheet</u>.”</em></blockquote><p>They mention at least some evidence for irreversibility for Greenland land ice: “…there is some evidence from general circulation models that the removal of the Greenland ice sheet would be irreversible, even if climate were to return to preindustrial conditions (<a href=""https://www.pnas.org/content/106/49/20590#ref-54"">54</a>), which increases the likelihood of a tipping point to exist. This finding, however, is disputed by others (<a href=""https://www.pnas.org/content/106/49/20590#ref-55"">55</a>), indicating the as-of-yet very large uncertainty in the modeling of ice-sheet behavior in a warmer climate (<a href=""https://www.pnas.org/content/106/49/20590#ref-56"">56</a>).” They also note that: “In this context, it should be noted that the local warming needed to slowly melt the Greenland ice sheet is estimated by some authors to be as low as 2.7° C warming above preindustrial temperatures (<a href=""https://www.pnas.org/content/106/49/20590#ref-64"">64</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.pnas.org/content/106/49/20590#ref-65"">65</a>). This amount of local warming is likely to be reached for a global warming of less than 2° C (<a href=""https://www.pnas.org/content/106/49/20590#ref-39"">39</a>).”</p><p>So we’re at real risk of melting Greenland ice, and doing so <em>might</em> not be easily reversible with temperature after the fact. Its <em>loss</em> could probably be slowed or hopefully stopped by temperature restoration, especially by solar radiation management — a recent <a href=""https://geoengineering.environment.harvard.edu/files/sgrp/files/the-cryosphere.pdf"">paper</a> reports that “<a href=""https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/4/4/045109"">Irvine et al. (2009)</a> conducted a study of the response of the Greenland Ice Sheet to a range of idealized and fixed scenarios of solar geoengineering deployment using the GLIMMER ice dynamics model driven by temperature and precipitation anomalies from a climate model and found that under an idealized scenario of quadrupled CO2 concentrations <em>solar geo-engineering could slow and even prevent the collapse of the ice sheet</em>.”</p><p>West Antarctica looks, if anything, worse. Notably, there is at least the <u>possibility of bistable dynamics or very strong hysteresis whereby Antarctic melting, once it got underway, could not be reversed even if we brought the temperature and atmospheric CO2 back to current levels</u>. It is apparently <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05003-z"">only recently</a> that quantitative modeling of the ice dynamics has made major strides.</p><p>In particular, the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is vulnerable to a so-called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_ice_sheet_instability"">Marine Ice Sheet Instability</a>, which some suggest may already be occurring, and which depends on the specific inward-sloping geometry of the land underlying that ice formation. It is possible that this dynamic is <em>already</em> starting to happen. (Not to be confused with the Marine Ice <em>Cliff</em> Instability, which <a href=""https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2019GL084183"">isn’t</a> looking too bad.)</p><p>Conceivably, though not by any means with certainty from what I can tell, <em>even</em> solar radiation management, which would artificially bring the <em>temperature</em> back down by lowering solar influx through the atmosphere, might <a href=""https://glacierhub.org/2018/08/16/solar-geoengineering-could-limit-sea-level-rise-from-the-cryosphere/"">not</a> be able to stop the <em>melting</em> when it is driven by such unstable undersea processes: in the case of the Antarctic, one <a href=""https://geoengineering.environment.harvard.edu/files/sgrp/files/the-cryosphere.pdf"">recent paper</a> suggested that</p><blockquote><em>“For Antarctica where ice discharge is the dominant loss mechanism, the most significant effect of climate change is to thin and weaken ice shelves which provide a buttressing effect, pushing back against the glaciers and slowing their flow into the ocean… whilst stratospheric aerosol geoengineering… could lower surface melt considerably it may have a limited ability to reduce ice shelf basal melt rates… there is the potential for runaway responses which would limit solar geoengineering’s potential to slow or reverse this contribution to sea level rise“.</em></blockquote><p>In other words, even if you could bring the temperature back to that of today (and I believe this could apply to restoring the CO2 level via negative emissions as well), you <em>might</em> not be able to stop the melting of West Antarctica.</p><p>All is not completely lost in that case, to be sure. There are <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03036-4"">at least some proposed local glacier management schemes</a> that could directly try to <a href=""https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/01/a-new-geo-engineering-proposal-to-stop-sea-level-rise/550214/"">limit</a> the ice loss, including buttressing the ice sheet underwater, as well as <a href=""https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/7/eaaw4132"">spraying snow</a> on top. Dyson somewhat fancifully <a href=""https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2008/09/25/the-question-of-global-warming-an-exchange/"">suggested</a> actively lowering sea levels by using a fleet of tethered kites or balloons to alter local weather patterns such that we would dump snow on comparatively stable <em>East</em> Antarctica, thus removing water from the oceans and actively lowering sea levels, irrespective of what caused those sea levels to rise in the first place. In short, given enough urgency and time humanity will likely find a way — and there are probably other ideas beyond Dyson’s kites that could actively reduce sea levels and counteract sea level rise regardless of its exact cause.</p><p>But seriously, we want to avoid major tipping points in the climate system. If we cross major tipping points in sea or land ice melt, it will be very challenging to deal with at best.</p><p>None of this is to say exactly how likely or unlikely it is that such tipping points would be reached. I simply don’t know, and I haven’t found much online to ground an answer in a specific temperature or timeframe — let me know if you have something really good on this. It is <em>hopefully</em> very unlikely even a bit above 2C warming, and hopefully very slow as well, giving more time to respond and, to the extent possible, reverse the melting.</p><p>But there is some real possibility that self-accelerating processes of ice melt in <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottsnowden/2019/08/16/greenlands-massive-ice-melt-wasnt-supposed-to-happen-until-2070"">Greenland</a> and West Antarctica are already happening. Here is a<a href=""https://nsidc.org/cryosphere/quickfacts/icesheets.html""> recent update</a> on Antarctica:</p><blockquote><em>“Most of Antarctica has yet to see dramatic warming. However, the Antarctic Peninsula, which juts out into warmer waters north of Antarctica, has warmed 2.5 degrees Celsius (4.5 degrees Fahrenheit) since 1950. A large area of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is also losing mass, probably because of warmer water deep in the ocean near the Antarctic coast. In East Antarctica, no clear trend has emerged, although some stations appear to be cooling slightly. Overall, scientists believe that Antarctica is starting to lose ice, but so far the process has not become as quick or as widespread as in Greenland.”</em><br><em><strong><a href=""https://nsidc.org/cryosphere/quickfacts/icesheets.html"">nsidc.org/cryosphere/quickfacts/icesheets.html</a></strong></em></blockquote><p>To summarize:</p><ul><li>Sea ice: hopefully fairly quickly reversible</li><li>Greenland melt: unclear, maybe reversible by solar radiation management or aggressive negative emissions</li><li>West Antarctica: may not be reversible at all except by things like active snow dumping via altering air flows, or by preventing the melt through things like direct buttressing of the ice sheet</li><li>East Antarctica: let’s hope it doesn’t melt… fortunately it seems unlikely to do so</li></ul><p>Of course there are many other potential impacts, e.g., <a href=""https://www.e-education.psu.edu/meteo469/node/167"">droughts</a>.</p><p>Further reading: IPCC <a href=""https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/WG1AR5_TS_FINAL.pdf"">technical summary</a>, NAS <a href=""http://web.gps.caltech.edu/classes/ese148a/NASclimatechange.pdf"">report on climate</a>, summary of IPCC report <a href=""https://www.carbonbrief.org/in-depth-qa-the-ipccs-special-report-on-the-ocean-and-cryosphere"">on the oceans</a>.</p><h2>Emissions</h2><p><strong>Note</strong>: This part starts to make a tiny bit of contact with human social, economic and cultural complexities.

On the plus side, Ramez Naam <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/15/how-to-decarbonize-america-and-the-world/"">argues</a> that building new renewables is becoming cheaper than operating existing coal. That’s the electricity sector, but other sectors like industrial steel and cement production, land use, heating, agriculture and aviation fuel do not have an equivalent cost-effective fossil fuel replacement yet — Ramez’s plan is very much worth reading in both regards, including for its suggestions for ARPA-style agencies for agriculture/food and industry/manufacturing.</p><h4>Evaluating some popular ideas about emissions reduction</h4><p>I found two examples interesting, from my brief attempt to gain some emissions numeracy:</p><p><strong>Example 1: Electric cars.</strong> We’ll use a rough figure of 250,000 non-electric cars = 1 megaton CO2 emitted per year. Now, there are roughly a billion cars in the world, so 1e9/2.5e5 * 1 megatonne = 4 gigatonnes CO2 from cars, out of about 37 emitted total. About 11% cars by that estimate. Transportation <a href=""http://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/global-greenhouse-gas-emissions-data#Sector"">overall</a> is 28% of emissions in the US, 14% globally. If we electrified all cars instantly, the <em>direct</em> dent in the overall problem is thus fractional but significant. But electrification of cars has implications for other important aspects, like renewables storage (e.g., <a href=""https://twitter.com/ricfulop/status/1170527207657263104"">batteries</a>) and the structure of the power grid, and for the price of oil. We haven’t considered the <a href=""https://electricinsights.co.uk/#/reports/report-2019-q2/detail/how-clean-is-my-electric-car?&amp;_k=a9i64w"">full life-cycle</a> effects of manufacturing and building electric versus conventional cars here, e.g., battery manufacturing, but it is <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikescott/2019/09/02/economics-of-electric-vehicles-mean-oils-days-as-a-transport-fuel-are-numbered/#7a7f68125102"">clear</a> that electric cars are <u>very</u> positive long term and have the <a href=""http://rameznaam.com/2016/04/12/how-cheap-can-electric-vehicles-get/"">potential</a> to massively disrupt the electricity sector as well as the transportation fuel sector. Musk points out <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUFwwlmxRsw"">here</a> that even <em>without</em> renewables, large-scale energy storage can decrease the need for coal or natural gas power plants by buffering over time. We’ll discuss the role of driving down battery costs in the broader picture of renewable electricity below.</p><p><strong>Example 2: Academic conference travel.</strong> Many of my colleagues <a href=""https://keplerlounge.com/neuroscience/2019/09/01/neuro4climate.html"">are</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/KordingLab/status/1166020276712177664"">talking</a> about reducing their plane flights to academic conferences in order to help fight climate change. My intuition was that this is <a href=""https://twitter.com/Peters_Glen/status/1146684832677806086"">not</a> <a href=""https://time.com/5669071/lifestyle-changes-climate-change/"">so</a> highly leveraged, at least as individual action rather than a <a href=""https://twitter.com/ClimateHuman/status/1167471241139081216"">cultural signal of urgency</a> to push large-scale action by big institutions and governments. After all, emissions from air travel are a small fraction of the total emissions, and the fraction of air travel due to the scientific community is small. (Fortunately there are <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05433"">other highly leveraged</a> ways for my colleagues in neuroscience or AI to contribute outside the social/advocacy sphere.) But let’s break down the issue more quantitatively. Say your flights to/from a far-away conference once yearly are on the order of 3 tonnes CO2 (this was for a <a href=""https://co2.myclimate.org/en/portfolios?calculation_id=2430403"">round-trip London to San Diego flight</a>), versus about 37 billion tonnes total CO2/year emitted globally. Say there are 2 million scientists traveling to conferences each year (the Society for Neuroscience meeting alone is 30k, but not all researchers travel to far-away conferences every year). That gives 6 million tonnes of CO2 from scientists traveling to conferences. Say it is 10-20 million tonnes of CO2 in reality, emitted yearly. That’s a 0.03-0.06% reduction of global emissions if we replaced it with, say, video calls. The carbon offsets for this CO2 appear to be around $100M-$200M a year (on the order of $10/tonne CO2).</p><h4>A bit about clean electricity, renewables, storage, nuclear, and the power grid</h4><p>I won’t talk <em>much</em> about clean energy generation here, instead pointing readers to David MacKay’s <a href=""https://www.withouthotair.com/"">amazing book</a> and this <a href=""https://sci-hub.tw/10.1016/j.joule.2018.11.013"">review paper</a>. But I will mention a few quick things about the scale of the problem, and about a few technologies.</p><p>According to <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogerpielke/2019/09/30/net-zero-carbon-dioxide-emissions-by-2050-requires-a-new-nuclear-power-plant-every-day/"">this article</a>, decarbonizing world energy consumption by 2050 would require building the equivalent of a nuclear power plant every 1.5 days, or 1500 wind turbines per day, from now till 2050, not to mention taking down old fossil fuel energy plants. Let’s work this out ourselves, and estimate a ballpark capital cost for it. Let’s use the figure of needing to decarbonize 16 TeraWatts (TW) or so, without introducing negative emissions technologies. A typical coal plant is, say, 600 MW or so. <a href=""https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=16+TW+%2F+%28600+MW%29+%2F+%2830+years+*365+days+per+year%29"">16 TW / (600 MW) / (30 years *365 days per year)</a> = equivalent of replacing 2.5 coal plants per day with non-fossil energy. Now let’s consider the cost of constructing new energy infrastructure. We’ll assume that constructing renewables or nuclear can be made cost-competitive with constructing fossil fuel plants. A new fossil fuel based plant costs <a href=""https://www.eia.gov/electricity/generatorcosts/"">say</a> on the order of $1000/kW</p><span><figure><img src=""https://i0.wp.com/longitudinal.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-02-at-10.52.40-PM.png?resize=462%2C436&amp;ssl=1"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:63%""></figure></span><p>So we’re talking $1000/kW * 16 TW / (30 years) = $500 billion per year. That’s half a percent of world GDP every year as a kind of lower-end estimate of up-front capital costs, barring much better/cheaper technology.</p><p><u>Nuclear</u></p><p>The details <a href=""https://foundersfund.com/2016/06/new-atomic-age-need/"">are</a> <a href=""https://www.greenbiz.com/article/bill-gates-quixotic-quest-revive-nuclear-power"">continually</a> <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/opinion/green-new-deal-climate-change.html"">vigorously</a> <a href=""https://cleantechnica.com/2019/01/24/why-excluding-nuclear-fossils-with-carbon-capture-biofuels-from-the-green-new-deal-makes-financial-climate-sense-realitycheck/"">debated</a>, but aggressive development and deployment of <a href=""https://www.knowablemagazine.org/article/technology/2019/nuclear-goes-retro-much-greener-outlook"">improved</a> <a href=""http://www.withouthotair.com/c24/page_169.shtml"">nuclear</a> <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/energysource/2012/02/16/the-thing-about-thorium-why-the-better-nuclear-fuel-may-not-get-a-chance/#7175fe991d80"">power</a> <a href=""https://terrapower.com/"">systems</a> (<a href=""https://www.helionenergy.com/"">including</a> probably <a href=""https://cfs.energy/"">fusion</a>, <em>long</em> term, which could be very <a href=""https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/products/compact-fusion.html"">compact</a>, long-lasting, and <a href=""https://www.iter.org/sci/Fusion"">safe</a>, although it is unclear it can come “in time”, from the perspective of significantly contributing to limiting the <em>peak</em> CO2 concentration in the atmosphere over the coming 2-3 decades — it is possible that it can, but a stretch and definitely unproven) <a href=""http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Nuclear+power"">seems</a> like an important <em>component</em>, at least in some countries.

But the idea that existing nuclear is fundamentally too expensive in the current regulatory environment is perhaps at least debatable. Nuclear <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_in_France"">is</a> the largest single source of energy in France with 58 reactors — although the just-linked post points out that the French nuclear industry is in financial trouble. In this <a href=""https://bravenewclimate.com/2011/01/21/the-cost-of-ending-global-warming-a-calculation/"">blog post</a> Chris Uhlik calculates what it would take to scale up nuclear technologies at <em>current cost levels</em>, and concludes the following</p><span><figure><img src=""https://i1.wp.com/longitudinal.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-26-at-11.00.04-PM.png?resize=406%2C371&amp;ssl=1"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:67%""></figure><em><a href=""https://bravenewclimate.com/2011/01/21/the-cost-of-ending-global-warming-a-calculation/"">https://bravenewclimate.com/2011/01/21/the-cost-of-ending-global-warming-a-calculation/</a></em></span><p><em><u><a href=""https://bravenewclimate.com/2011/01/21/the-cost-of-ending-global-warming-a-calculation/"">https://bravenewclimate.com/2011/01/21/the-cost-of-ending-global-warming-a-calculation/</a></u></em></p><p>So that’s about 5-10x as much as our 0.5% world GDP per year lower-end estimate above, based on the approximate cost of fossil plants, a cost level which new renewables appear to be rapidly approaching. Uhlik still calls it “cheap”, and that doesn’t seem unreasonable given the benefits.</p><p>Is Uhlik missing anything? Well, one key issue is the fuel. There are two issues within that: 1) availability, and 2) safe disposal. As far as availability, <a href=""http://newmaeweb.ucsd.edu/courses/MAE119/WI_2018/ewExternalFiles/Hoffert%20et%20al%20%282002%29%20Advanced%20Technology%20Paths%20to%20Global%20Cl.pdf"">this review paper suggests</a> that getting enough for <em>traditional</em> U235 reactors to completely power the planet for decades may be a stretch. They suggest either using <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breeder_reactor"">breeder reactors</a>, such as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorium-based_nuclear_power"">thorium reactors</a>, or getting fusion to work, to get around this. You might thus not be surprised that Uhlik is involved in <a href=""https://atomicinsights.com/thorium-2/"">thorium reactor projects</a> — indeed I think his post <em>should be</em> <em>understood in the context of scaling up thorium reactors</em>, not existing uranium light water reactors. Thorium is still at an <a href=""https://www.quora.com/Does-the-functional-prototype-of-thorium-reactor-exist"">early</a> stage of development, although some <a href=""http://thorconpower.com/"">companies</a> are trying to scale up the existing experiments. For two contrary perspectives on thorium, see <a href=""https://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/legacy/assets/documents/nuclear_power/thorium-reactors-statement.pdf"">here</a> and <a href=""https://thebulletin.org/2018/08/thorium-power-has-a-protactinium-problem/#"">here</a>. Beyond thorium per se, though, <a href=""https://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/current-and-future-generation/molten-salt-reactors.aspx"">there are</a> <a href=""https://www.businessinsider.com/bill-gates-terrapower-molten-salt-nuclear-reactor-2018-10"">many other apparently promising types of molten salt reactors</a>.</p><p>The waste disposal problem seems complex and depends on the reactor technology. Moreover, some novel reactors could be <a href=""https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/southern-company-and-terrapower-prep-testing-molten-salt-reactor"">fueled on the waste of others</a>, or even consume their own waste over time. There are also a lot of questions about how waste streams from existing nuclear technologies could be <a href=""https://thebreakthrough.org/articles/beyond-yucca-mountain"">better</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/gilbeaq/status/1177306755782590465"">dealt</a> with.</p><p>What about safety? My impression is that nuclear can actually be <a href=""https://ourworldindata.org/what-is-the-safest-form-of-energy"">very safe</a>, Chernobyl <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/apr/05/anti-nuclear-lobby-misled-world"">notwithstanding</a>. Moreover, advancing technologies intersect in all sorts of ways that could make nuclear more feasible in <em>more places</em>, e.g., <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0438-y"">improved</a> Earthquake prediction might help.</p><p>The basic idea of: make a surplus of cheap, safe, robust nuclear energy –&gt; electrify many other sectors to reduce their GHG emissions –&gt; also power negative emissions industrial direct air capture… seems like something we should be seriously considering.</p><p>But in practice, the high up front construction cost — currently <a href=""http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2016/ph241/long1/"">perhaps</a> $4000-$5000/kW, roughly 5x the construction cost of the other types of power plant shown above — could be a concern, as could be the need to move beyond traditional Uranium light water reactors to get to full grid scale. Analyzing this is complex, as prices are changing and will change further with the advent of small modular reactors, and there will naturally be an ever-changing mixture of energy sources used and needed as renewables scale up to a significant fraction of the power grid.</p><p><em>Interlude: Fusion</em></p><p>Fusion is an interesting one. There is no fundamental obstacle, and many advantages over fission-based nuclear. Around mid-century, it will probably be working and becoming widespread. The key question is whether this can happen sooner, say in the next 15 years. Advantages, paraphrased and quoted from the <a href=""http://www.iter.org/"">ITER website</a>, include:</p><ul><li>Can have roughly 4x energy per fuel mass over fission</li><li>Abundant fuel, e.g., hydrogen isotopes deuterium and tritium. Deuterium can be distilled from water, then tritium generated (“bred”) during operation, when neutrons hit lithium in the walls of the reactor: “While a 1000 MW coal-fired power plant requires 2.7 million tonnes of coal per year, a fusion plant of the kind envisioned for the second half of this century will only require 250 kilos of fuel per year, half of it deuterium, half of it tritium.”</li><li>Less of a radioactive waste problem. Basically makes helium from isotopes of hydrogen. Particles hitting materials in the reactor do activate the materials in the reactor, but not creating large amounts of long-lived waste like in fission.</li><li>Safety: “Only a few grams of fuel are present in the plasma at any given moment. This makes a fusion reactor incredibly economical in its fuel consumption and also confers important safety benefits to the installation.” Also, “A Fukushima-type nuclear accident is not possible in a tokamak fusion device. It is difficult enough to reach and maintain the precise conditions necessary for fusion—if any disturbance occurs, the plasma cools within seconds and the reaction stops. The quantity of fuel present in the vessel at any one time is enough for a few seconds only and there is no risk of a chain reaction.”</li></ul><p>Otherwise, pretty similar to fission in terms of what it would look like for scale-up to power the world. These are big complex machines. It is a very difficult way to boil water, and not clear how well cost will scale down, unlike say, solar cells.</p><p>No demonstration reactor has yet generated net energy gain. ITER is expected to get 10x gain for a duration of several minutes. It will also be useful for testing all sorts of control mechanisms and properties of the plasma and its effects. But this will be happening after 2035 according to their plan, from what I understand.</p><p>The main approach now being developed uses magnetic confinement of a plasma that must be heated to &gt;100 million degrees Celsius. Tokamaks are one class of magnetic confinement system, in which the plasma follows a helical magnetic field path inside a toroidal shaped vacuum chamber.</p><p>ITER is a Tokamak. ITER is a big, long, complex international project that is deliberately distributing effort across many international organizations. It <a href=""https://www.theengineer.co.uk/beyond-iter-next-steps-in-fusion-power/"">extends</a> well past 2040 for its major scientific milestones, not to mention future power plant scale followups and commercialization. In contrast, a previous fusion reactor, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_European_Torus"">JET</a> was completed much faster, decades ago.</p><p>A recent <a href=""https://www.nap.edu/read/25331/chapter/5#"">National Academies Report </a>explained why, though it is important to stay involved in ITER, new opportunities could allow a faster and somewhat cheaper approach to a full integrated pilot plant, which would hopefully synergize well with ITER. What makes sense in addition to ITER is pushing “<a href=""https://www.nap.edu/read/25331/chapter/6"">compact fusion</a>“. But you have to understand that this is not easy or fast, either. You need things like: creating walls that can withstand a huge bombardment of neutrons, and manufacturing large amounts of high-temperature <a href=""https://www.tokamakenergy.co.uk/tokamak-energy-exceeds-target-of-20-tesla-with-hts-magnets/"">superconducting</a> wires or tapes to make compact yet very-high-field magnets.</p><p>From the NAS report, the challenges include the following: “A compact fusion pilot plant requires developing operation scenarios for sustaining high-power density burning plasma with the plasma exhaust capability required for compact fusion. The engineering <em>design and fabrication of large bore, high-field superconducting magnets</em> for fusion needs to be established. <em>Long-lifetime materials</em> will need to be developed and qualified for use in the compact fusion pilot plant. <em>Tritium science and fusion breeding blanket development</em> needs to be developed sufficiently for integrated nonnuclear testing of prototypes that can serve as the basis for blanket components that will ultimately be installed in the compact pilot plant. Finally, to be successful, a detailed <em>system engineering</em> effort is needed to guide a “pre-pilot-plant” research program toward construction of a low capital-cost fusion pilot plant”.</p><p>Note the importance of large scale manufacturing of high temperature superconducting wires and tape: “Today’s opportunity for compact magnet fusion energy results from the potential for high-field superconducting magnets. New <em>high-temperature superconductors may make possible fusion magnets that can achieve fusion gain and power equivalent to ITER but at a significantly lower size and cost</em>… Industry can now produce <em>commercial quantities of high-temperature superconducting tapes</em> that have the potential to be used in very high field fusion magnets that will reduce the size needed to magnetically confine a burning plasma.”</p><p>So it will take at minimum years, if not a decade or more, perhaps much longer, just to get to a compact fusion pilot plant, which may not even be strongly net-positive in energy gain, let alone full scale useful power plants with economies of scale and proven industrial rollout: “The initial pilot plant operation would demonstrate net-electric equivalent performance in a compact fusion system, focusing on integrated core/edge performance, assessing plasma material interactions, demonstrating tritium pumping, limited breeding, safe handling, and extraction. This initial phase <em>would not include long-pulse fusion power production and would not demonstrate self-sufficient tritium production</em>. The second phase of the pilot plant would seek near continuous operation, allow for materials/component testing with neutron fluences approaching power-plant levels, and provide integrated blanket testing. Upon success of this second phase, <em>the compact fusion pilot plant studies would have reduced both the economic and technical risks for fusion energy-based electricity production</em> and will motivate further involvement from industries and utilities…”</p><p>There are a number of companies pursuing things that are along these lines of some kind of next-gen compact magnetic confinement, including Commonwealth Fusion, Tokamak Energy, and Lockheed Martin’s Skunkworks.

A distinct hybrid approach is being pursued by TAE. There was an ARPA-E program called <a href=""https://arpa-e.energy.gov/?q=arpa-e-programs/alpha"">ALPHA</a> to <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.09921"">pursue</a> initial academic-scale research on hybrid approaches that move beyond classical magnetic confinement type approaches, including so-called <a href=""https://www.burningplasma.org/resources/ref/fspp/whitepapers/Magneto-Inertial-Fusion-2014-white-paper-final.pdf"">magneto-inertial</a> fusion and “<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-pinch"">z-pinch</a>“. Here is from the ALPHA website: “Most mainstream fusion research currently focuses on one of two approaches to confining plasmas: magnetic confinement, which uses magnetic fields and lower-than-air ion densities, and inertial confinement, which uses heating and compression and involves greater-than-solid densities. The ALPHA program aims to create additional options for fusion research by developing the tools for new, lower-cost pathways to fusion, and with a focus on intermediate densities in between these two approaches. These new intermediate density options may offer reduced size, energy, and power-density requirements for fusion reactors and enable low-cost, transformative routes to economical fusion power.” The company General Fusion appears to be pursuing something along those lines, and the company Helion was in the ALPHA portfolio according to the just-linked retrospective.

This could include large-scale storage, improved transmission systems that allow <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bri-Mathias_Hodge/publication/314198578_Achieving_a_100_Renewable_Grid_Operating_Electric_Power_Systems_with_Extremely_High_Levels_of_Variable_Renewable_Energy/links/59e9018faca272bc425f54f3/Achieving-a-100-Renewable-Grid-Operating-Electric-Power-Systems-with-Extremely-High-Levels-of-Variable-Renewable-Energy.pdf"">balancing</a> the grid through integration of more geographically diverse and hence uncorrelated sources (e.g., via the technology of “<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-voltage_direct_current"">high voltage direct current</a>” transmission), flexible long-distance digital control of certain loads, as well as novel distributed control strategies.</p><p>In a system nearing 100% variable renewable energy without storage, the control architecture of the power grid has to change, because existing control strategies rely heavily on the mechanical inertia of the large spinning turbines in conventional power plants — the current small percentage of variable renewables in the grid is able to integrate by following the patterns established by these large non-variable sources, and by being smoothed out by conventional fossil fuel sources. The Stanford roadmap makes reference to a separate <a href=""https://www.pnas.org/content/112/49/15060"">study</a> where they did detailed simulations of variability based on weather, and incorporated the use of various existing storage technologies to allow grid integration. A paper was <a href=""https://www.pnas.org/content/114/26/6722"">published</a> in PNAS, however, questioning their assumptions and arguing:</p><blockquote><em>“… it is not in question that it would be theoretically possible to build a reliable energy system excluding all bioenergy, nuclear energy, and fossil fuel sources. Given unlimited resources to build variable energy production facilities, while expanding the transmission grid and accompanying energy storage capacity enormously, one would eventually be able to meet any conceivable load. However, in developing a strategy to effectively mitigate global energy-related CO2&nbsp;emissions, it is critical that the scope of the challenge to achieve this in the real world is accurately defined and clearly communicated… The study… assumes a total of 2,604 GW of storage charging capacity, more than double the entire current capacity of all power plants in the United States… The</em> <em><strong>energy storage capacity consists almost entirely of two technologies that remain unproven</strong></em> <em>at any scale: 514.6 TWh of UTES (the largest UTES facility today is 0.0041 TWh) (additional discussion is in SI Appendix, section S2.1) and 13.26 TWh of phase change materials (PCMs; effectively in research and demonstration phase) (additional discussion is in SI Appendix, section S2.2) coupled to concentrating solar thermal power (CSP). To give an idea of scale, the 100% wind, solar, and hydroelectric power system proposed in ref. 11 envisions UTES systems deployed in nearly every community for nearly every home, business, office building, hospital, school, and factory in the United States, although only a handful exist today…”</em></blockquote><p>The above-linked post from Uhlik on thorium reactors also contains a quantitative <a href=""https://atomicinsights.com/thorium-2/"">critique</a> of the assumptions of the Jacobson wind-water-solar roadmap.</p><p>(I would be remiss not to mention the Stanford group’s <a href=""https://www.pnas.org/content/114/26/E5021"">reply</a> which among other things states: “Clack et al. (1) assert that underground thermal energy storage (UTES) can’t be expanded nationally, but we disagree. UTES is a form of district heating, which is already used worldwide (e.g., 60% of Denmark); UTES is technologically mature and inexpensive; moreover, hot-water storage or heat pumps can substitute for UTES. Similarly, molten salt can substitute for phase change materials in CSP storage.”)</p><p>How much storage does one really need to go fully to variable renewables, and what would the cost of storage have to be for this to be possible? <a href=""https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(19)30300-9"">This paper</a> says the cost of storage would have to go to about $20/kWh for a cost-competitive 100% variable renewables grid. Meanwhile, lithium ion batteries currently cost around $140/kWh, but are <a href=""https://about.bnef.com/blog/behind-scenes-take-lithium-ion-battery-prices/"">projected</a> to reach $60/kWh by 2030: see projection from Ramez Naam below. However, the paper just mentioned <em>also</em> pointed out that, if you only need to be 95% based on variable renewables, then the storage cost target is significantly less stringent. That seems fairly optimistic for the medium term.</p><span><figure><img src=""https://i1.wp.com/longitudinal.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/How-Cheap-Can-Energy-Storage-Get-Batteries-Flow-CAES-Lightsail.jpg?fit=1024%2C537&amp;ssl=1"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:89%""></figure><em>From Ramez Naam:</em> <em><a href=""http://rameznaam.com/2015/10/14/how-cheap-can-energy-storage-get/"">http://rameznaam.com/2015/10/14/how-cheap-can-energy-storage-get/</a></em></span><p><em>From Ramez Naam:</em> <em><a href=""http://rameznaam.com/2015/10/14/how-cheap-can-energy-storage-get/"">http://rameznaam.com/2015/10/14/how-cheap-can-energy-storage-get/</a></em></p><p>Can we ballpark why these kinds of optimistic numbers could make some intuitive sense? Ramez Naam gives some explanation <a href=""http://rameznaam.com/2016/01/31/how-far-can-renewables-go-pretty-darn-far/"">here</a> and <a href=""http://rameznaam.com/2015/10/14/how-cheap-can-energy-storage-get/"">here</a>. Here’s another quick stab at it, building on Naam and MacKay: Suppose your lithium ion battery costs $100 per kWh of capacity (which will be true in a few years) and can be charged/discharged 1000 times. That’s 10 cents to charge/discharge a kWh of battery each time — you can see that’s the range in the middle of Ramez Naam’s curve above. Now, that’s comparable to the raw electricity cost, so if you needed to be constantly charging and discharging the battery to supply every kWh of electricity that you use, you’d be doubling your energy cost. But ideally you only need to use the battery infrequently. Let’s say that a person in a rich country needs to be able to store 20 kWh (a Tesla car battery is ~60-80 kWh) per person over periods on the order of 5 days (this last number is <a href=""https://www.withouthotair.com/c26/page_189.shtml"">from</a> MacKay for the case of wind power in England). Your 20 kWh charge/discharge costs $2, and let’s say you have to do this once a week. That’s $104 dollars a year on your energy bill due to the battery, likely only a fraction of your total electricity cost if you’re in a rich country.</p><p>Still, that’s a <a href=""http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2010/ph240/eason2/"">lot</a> of batteries. Eventually, it seems limited world lithium reserves will become a <a href=""https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/is-there-enough-lithium-to-maintain-the-growth-of-the-lithium-ion-battery-m"">problem</a>. But of course, there may be other ways to make batteries based on <a href=""https://www.technologyreview.com/s/614467/how-a-new-class-of-startups-are-working-to-solve-the-grid-storage-puzzle/"">other</a> materials, and new forms of storage, that can kick in by then.</p><p>(MacKay <a href=""https://www.withouthotair.com/c26/page_194.shtml"">argues</a> that the best variable renewables grid integration approach for England would indeed be to massively deploy electric cars, and to make their charging process smart so that they would charge primarily when there is a surplus of power available and not charge when there was a deficit. You’d need to get a large fraction of people having a smart-charging electric car for that to work: he estimates a fleet of 30 million such grid-synced smart-charging electric cars could allow England to be powered by wind. That’s about half of all people in England owning an electric car. Even better would be if they would donate power back to the grid as opposed to simply adjusting demand to better match supply. Smart buildings and fridges are also in this category.)</p><p>A brief interlude on other grid-scale storage technologies:</p><ul><li><em>Compressed air energy storage</em> has some very appealing features, e.g., it can be very large-scale, and doesn’t require any exotic materials like lithium. Here is the basic issue. When you compress air quickly, you heat it. This heat has to go somewhere and then has to be recovered. Otherwise you have thermal losses. Ideally, you’d be able to do isothermal compression and expansion, shuttling heat slowly to and from the environment at a constant temperature with no energy permanently lost in doing so — any heat you give off, you get back for free. Unfortunately this is not easy to do for compressed air energy storage, e.g., you have to compress a lot of air to a high pressure quickly, and this is hard to do while maintaining a constant temperature and fast thermal contact with the outside world. Innovative but now sadly defunct company LightSail tried to deal with this through a “quasi-isothermal” process in which water vapor was injected into the compressing air to absorb the heat and then release it back during expansion — because water has a very high specific heat, it can absorb a lot of heat with minimal change in temperature. Fortunately, there <a href=""https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/60b3/c29eaada039d0ee12cd9f987c18d97d531f6.pdf"">are</a> <a href=""https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f41b/ad7bf9a946e0d1c2917310f12fd8766361ab.pdf"">published</a> <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0894177718304862"">papers</a> <a href=""https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/appene/v225y2018icp955-964.html"">and</a> <a href=""https://patents.google.com/patent/US20130269331A1/en"">patents</a> and <a href=""http://www.fluidmechanics.co.uk/isothermal-compression/"">others</a> taking related approaches. How do the numbers work out for this? Using the formula for the energy associated with isothermal compression, we <a href=""https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=300+atm+*+1+m%5E3+*+Ln%5B300+atm+%2F+1+atm%5D+in+kwh"">could</a> store in theory about 50 kWh per cubic meter of compressed air at 300 atm pressure, whereas LightSail was <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4745982"">trying to reach</a> about 30 kWh per cubic meter. (Beyond the quasi-isothermal approach, there are others that try to be adiabatic or that couple the heat to things like hydrogen production.)</li><li><em>Molten salt</em> thermal energy storage is basically storing heat. You want to store a lot of heat, and for purely practical reasons melted salts are a good medium in which to store it. As <a href=""https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/2008/06/26/storing-the-sun-molten-salt-provides-highly-efficient-thermal-storage-52873/"">this article explains</a>: “The salt is a combination of sodium and potassium nitrate, with a melting temperature of 460°F. In the liquid state, molten salt has the viscosity and the appearance similar to water. “In solar applications, molten salt is used for a number of practical reasons,” says Terry Murphy, Chief Executive Officer for SolarReserve, who along with others helped develop the molten salt technology at Rocketdyne. “Molten salt is a heat storage medium that retains thermal energy very effectively over time and operates at temperatures greater than 1000°F, which matches well with the most efficient steam turbines. Second, it remains in a liquid state throughout the plant’s operating regime, which will improve long-term reliability and reduce O&amp;M costs. And third, it’s totally ‘green,’ molten salt is a non-toxic, readily available material, similar to commercial fertilizers.” A primary advantage of molten salt central receiver technology is that the molten salt can be heated to 1050°F, which allows high energy steam to be generated at utility-standard temperatures (1650 psi minimum, 1025°F), achieving high thermodynamic cycle efficiencies of approximately 40 percent in modern steam turbine systems…” Laughlin has proposed a <a href=""https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.4994054"">particular</a> heat engine design using such molten salts.</li><li><em>Flow batteries</em> are electrochemical energy storage. The “flow” refers to the fact that you don’t have to place the chemicals right in the path between the electrodes: the chemicals can be in separate tanks that can flow into that space as needed. Also, they can be based on materials more abundant than lithium, e.g., <a href=""https://www.essinc.com/energy-storage-products/"">iron</a>, and even largely on <a href=""https://aziz.seas.harvard.edu/files/azizgroup/files/mja240.pdf"">organic</a> chemicals, not rare elements like lithium. As <a href=""https://www.seas.harvard.edu/news/2014/01/organic-mega-flow-battery-promises-breakthrough-for-renewable-energy"">this article explains</a>: “Flow batteries store energy in chemical fluids contained in external tanks—as with fuel cells—instead of within the battery container itself. The two main components—the electrochemical conversion hardware through which the fluids are flowed (which sets the peak power capacity), and the chemical storage tanks (which set the energy capacity)—may be independently sized. Thus the amount of energy that can be stored is limited only by the size of the tanks.

There are <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUFwwlmxRsw"">powerful</a> <a href=""https://www.greenbiz.com/article/packaging-carbon-tax-can-we-affect-emitter-behavior-consumer-behavior"">arguments</a> in <a href=""https://www.carbonpricingleadership.org/news/2017/5/25/leading-economists-a-strong-carbon-price-needed-to-drive-large-scale-climate-action"">favor</a> of a carbon tax. Specifically, one can do a gradually scaled-up, revenue-neutral carbon tax that would, for instance, return the revenues back to consumers as rebates or tax reductions in other kinds of taxes — this could be important as almost any form of carbon tax would ultimately be passed at least in significant part onto the consumer, and many consumers are cash-strapped already, e.g., struggling to afford gas for their commute.</p><p>How big a carbon tax, and what effects would that have on citizens? That’s a complicated question and not one I have found a full answer to. Typical values suggest something like $10-$100 per tonne of CO2, meant to offset widely-varying estimates of the social cost of carbon. That would apparently increase, say, the gas bill for your car by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_tax#Calculation"">roughly</a> 10 cents to 1 dollar per gallon of gas (the current average price of gas in the USA is around <a href=""https://gasprices.aaa.com/"">$2.50/gallon</a>, and there is already an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_tax#United_States"">excise tax</a> on it of about 1/10 that).</p><p>Alas, consumers in the USA <a href=""https://twitter.com/Noahpinion/status/1173049629723643904"">seem</a> wary of changes in that range. It is unclear if they would <em>still</em> be wary if they were presented with a <u>rebate</u> (remember, the carbon tax can be revenue-neutral, or at least with significant offsets to give cash back to citizens, although some would hope to use revenues from a carbon tax to fund climate-related programs and deployments) that would o<em>n net leave most people’s bank accounts the same or fatter</em>, not thinner.</p><p>A few points of comparison:</p><ul><li>We’ll see in the next post that technologies aiming to scrub carbon from the atmosphere are shooting to get their cost of CO2 produced into this same range, say &lt;$100/tonne CO2.</li><li>If the US is currently emitting 6 GigaTonnes of CO2 and we had a $40/tonne CO2 carbon tax right now, that would presumably be something like $240 billion per year in carbon tax revenue, or a bit under 1/10 of all <a href=""https://www.nationalpriorities.org/budget-basics/federal-budget-101/revenues/"">US federal tax revenue</a> of $3.something trillion. Could we re-structure the rest of the tax code to give back 1/10 to consumers, as a rebate, so that their bank accounts (and the overall size of government) stay roughly flat? I bet we could. But this puts into perspective that, if someone is instead talking about a $400/tonne CO2 price of carbon (see the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stern_Review"">Stern Review</a> item in the table below), that’s approaching the totality of all other tax revenue in the USA at current emissions levels.</li><li>That $240 billion paid against the $40/tonne carbon price is around 1.2% of US GDP of around $20 trillion.</li></ul><p>There are also some arguments <a href=""http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/2012/06/carbon-taxes-wont-work-heres-what-will.html"">against</a> a carbon tax, e.g., that a carbon tax in the US doesn’t impact other countries like China and may simply shift international trade balances, or that they might be revoked, as well as the need for them to be sufficiently large and thus correspondingly painful to the consumer in order to make a difference. They are also empirically <a href=""https://www.technologyreview.com/s/612392/people-will-never-vote-for-a-carbon-tax-so-lets-stop-asking/"">not easy</a> to pass, and economists are <a href=""https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/why-carbon-taxes-are-so-hard-pass"">studying why</a>.</p><p>France had a fuel tax of about $60/ton CO2 equivalent, but when Macron tried to double that over the next 4 years, the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_vests_movement"">Yellow Vest protests</a> happened (this may of course be specific to the kind of fuel tax they imposed and the particular situation there). Canada <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/oct/26/canada-passed-a-carbon-tax-that-will-give-most-canadians-more-money"">did</a> pass a carbon tax starting at below that level and rising to near it over a few years (“start low at $20 per ton [tonne of emitted CO2] in 2019, rising at $10 per ton per year until reaching $50 per ton in 2022”). Recently, some major fossil energy companies started <a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-20/oil-companies-join-corporate-lobbying-push-for-u-s-carbon-tax"">lobbying in favor</a> of a carbon tax, which I found surprising — <a href=""https://www.vox.com/2018/10/18/17983866/climate-change-exxon-carbon-tax-lawsuit"">alas</a>, it looks like they are putting in pennies compared to their fossil-fuel-promoting endeavors, in a bid to insure themselves against future climate-related lawsuits!</p><p>Cap and trade is another possibility, arguably <a href=""https://www.wri.org/blog/2016/03/carbon-tax-vs-cap-and-trade-what-s-better-policy-cut-emissions"">fundamentally similar</a>. Cap and trade has the advantage of <em>directly</em> setting a specific emissions limit.

It doesn’t look that stringent, yet: “The scheme set the initial carbon allowances to 3–5 billion tonnes per year.”</p><p>Subsidizing R&amp;D into decarbonization technologies is the key alternative <a href=""http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/2012/06/carbon-taxes-wont-work-heres-what-will.html"">suggested</a> by Noah Smith — if you get a breakthrough towards lower-cost technology, that can be adopted anywhere in the world (including places that may not feel they can afford a carbon tax), and only benefits people (no change in tax structure).

Consider this snippet from the <a href=""https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2018/10/popular-economicsciencesprize2018.pdf"">Nobel Prize announcement</a> for economist William Nordhaus, who <a href=""http://econdse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/integrated_economic_and_climate_modeling_nordhaus_ssrn_dec_2011.pdf"">pioneered</a> this area:</p><span><figure><img src=""https://i2.wp.com/longitudinal.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Image-1.png?resize=638%2C450&amp;ssl=1"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:638%""></figure><em><a href=""https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2018/10/popular-economicsciencesprize2018.pdf"">https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2018/10/popular-economicsciencesprize2018.pdf</a></em></span><p><em><a href=""https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2018/10/popular-economicsciencesprize2018.pdf"">https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2018/10/popular-economicsciencesprize2018.pdf</a></em></p><p>Nordhaus uses coupled climate + economic activity and growth models to evaluate “optimal” scenarios — ones with the maximum overall growth in the economy, factoring in the effects of damage from climate change and the costs of introducing decarbonization approaches. His <em>optimal</em> overall economic scenario (“Opt”) is the one shown in red in the plot above, with a global carbon tax starting at <a href=""https://www.pnas.org/content/114/7/1518"">$30-40/tonne CO2</a> or so (and rising to about $50/tonne by 2030 and then further afterwards, see table below). Note, though, that this pathway massively overshoots the orange and black pathways in terms of emissions — the black and orange pathways look more like the other graphs we’ve seen for <em>full decarbonization by 2050</em>. Here is a table from his 2017 PNAS paper with a comparison:</p><span><figure><img src=""https://i2.wp.com/longitudinal.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Image-1-1.png?resize=628%2C350&amp;ssl=1"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:79%""></figure><em>Nordhaus, William D. “Revisiting the social cost of carbon.”&nbsp;</em><br><em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&nbsp;114.7 (2017): 1518-1523.</em></span><p><em>Nordhaus, William D. “Revisiting the social cost of carbon.”&nbsp;</em><br><em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&nbsp;114.7 (2017): 1518-1523.</em></p><p>Indeed, the optimality of an Opt-like pathway is a subject of great <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0071-9"">controversy</a>. Nordhaus’s “optimal” carbon pricing, in that model, would get us to a temperature rise of 3.5C (!) or so from preindustrial, while pushing to full decarbonization by 2050, in order to stay below 2C, would require roughly an order of magnitude higher carbon price. Staying below 1.5C would seem, according to such models, to imply a need for<a href=""https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev-environ-102017-025817""> </a>even higher carbon prices.

So implicitly the risk of such scenarios is considered low in such models. At a more subtle level, the particulars of these optima depend on the expected cost of decarbonization (which depends on the rate of technological innovation), on the temporal <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics_of_climate_change_mitigation#Discount_rates"">discount rates</a> used (you can see in the table above that prices rapidly rise with decreasing discount rate), and on other factors.</p><p>There are some good-sounding arguments for having <a href=""https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2019/09/30/1817444116"">carbon prices instead start high, and then decline</a>, political difficulties notwithstanding — I haven’t understood the full details, but this approach seems to focus on mitigating risk and to take into account more of the variance in scenarios and our finite but improving knowledge thereof.</p><p>The fact is, as the Nobel Prize announcement notes, there are huge uncertainties in what would really be optimal (even <em>within</em> the philosophical frame that underlies Nordhaus’s analysis, e.g., with the type and rough magnitude of the discount rate he uses, and even neglecting the politics of passing such taxes) — it depends on the cost of decarbonizing quickly, and on the climate damage cost of <em>not</em> decarbonizing quickly, both of which are highly uncertain at present. So we have to take a best guess — but that best guess should incorporate the uncertainty.</p><p><strong>This brings us back to the role of technology</strong>: it can <em>reduce the cost of decarbonization</em>, and it can <em>mitigate tail risks</em> from climate damage. Advanced technology is crucial to allow us to decarbonize safely and quickly, with minimal economic cost. It allows a lower self-imposed carbon price to have greater benefit, shifting the estimated-to-be-economically-optimal pathways to overlap those that strongly limit the <a href=""https://earther.gizmodo.com/we-may-have-been-thinking-about-a-carbon-price-all-wron-1838662832"">risk</a> of crossing catastrophic climate tipping points.</p><h4><u>Tentative conclusions</u></h4><p>My sense — again, as an outsider to the field simply trying to grok the literature in my free time — is that we should do the following:</p><ul><li>Make sure our ability to <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02846-4"">measure</a> and <a href=""https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/07/science-insurgents-plot-climate-model-driven-artificial-intelligence"">model</a> everything in the climate system continues to improve, including for complex land and ocean biological effects.</li><li>Lobby for a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUFwwlmxRsw"">revenue-neutral, staged price on carbon</a>, in rich countries initially — rich countries can bring down the cost for poor countries by developing and scaling up better, cheaper technology.

If you imagine that AI will slowly crawl from village idiot to Einstein, then presumably we will have ample time to see powerful AI coming in advance.

I further posit that when this distinction is unraveled, the remaining variation we observe isn't that surprising.

I have simply put two explanations together, which in my opinion, explain a large fraction of the observed variation.</p><h1>Explanation 1: Distinguish learning from competence</h1><p>Humans, despite our great differences in other regards, still mostly learn things the same way.

To the extent that people <em>do</em> speed up lectures by 2x on Youtube, or speed read, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_reading#Controversies_in_speed_reading"">they lose retention</a>.</p><p>And putting aside tall tales of people learning quantum mechanics over a weekend, it turns out to be surprisingly difficult for humans to beat the strategy of long-term focused practice for becoming an expert at some task. </p><p>From this, we have an important insight: the range of learning abilities in humans is relatively small. There don't really seem to be humans who tower above us in terms of their ability to soak up new information and process it. </p><p>This prompts the following hypothetical objection,</p><blockquote>Are you sure? If I walk into a graduate-level mathematics course without taking the prerequisites seriously, then I'm going to be seriously behind the other students. While they learn the material, I will be struggling to understand even the most basic of concepts in the course.</blockquote><p>Yes, but that's because you haven't taken the prerequisites. Doing well in a course is a product of learning ability * competence at connecting it to prior knowledge. If you separate learning ability and competence, you will see that your learning ability is still quite similar to the other students. </p><p>Eric Drexler makes this distinction in <a href=""https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/Reframing_Superintelligence_FHI-TR-2019-1.1-1.pdf"">Reframing Superintelligence</a>,</p><blockquote>Since Good (1966), superhuman intelligence has been equated with superhuman intellectual competence, yet this definition misses what we mean by human intelligence. A child is considered intelligent because of learning capacity, not competence, while an expert is considered intelligent because of competence, not learning capacity. Learning capacity and competent performance are distinct characteristics in human beings, and are routinely separated in AI development. Distinguishing learning from competence is crucial to understanding both prospects for AI development and potential mechanisms for controlling superintelligent-level AI systems.</blockquote><p>Let's consider this distinction in light of one of the cases that Katja pointed to above: chess. I find it easy to believe that Magnus Carlsen would beat me handily in chess, even while playing upside-down and blindfolded. But does this mean that Magnus Carlsen is vastly more intelligent than me?</p><p>Well, no, because Magnus Carlsen has spent several hours a day playing chess <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnus_Carlsen#Childhood"">ever since he was 5</a>, and I've spent roughly 0 hours a day. A fairer comparison is other human experts who have spent the same amount of practicing chess. And there, you might still see a lot of variation (see the next theory), but not nearly as much as between Magnus Carlson and me.</p><p>This theory can also be empirically tested. In my mind there are (at least) two formulations of the theory:</p><p>One version roughly states that, background knowledge and motivation levels being equal, humans will learn how to perform new tasks at roughly equal rates. </p><p>Another version of this theory roughly states that everything that top-humans can learn, most humans can too if they actually tried. That is, there <em>is</em> psychological unity of humankind in what we <em>can learn</em>, but not necessarily what we <em>have learned. </em>By contrast, a mouse really couldn't learn chess, even if they tried. And in turn, no human can learn to play 90-dimensional chess, unlike the hypothetical superintelligences that can.</p><p>You can also use this framework to cast the intelligence of machine learning systems in a new light. AlphaGo <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.00289"">took</a> a hundred million games to grow to the competence of Lee Sedol. But Lee Sedol has only played about 50,000 games in his life.</p><p>Point being, when we talk about AI getting more advanced, we're really mostly talking about what type of tasks computers can now learn, and how quickly. Hence the name <em>machine learning</em>...</p><h1>Explanation 2: Similar architecture does not imply similar performance</h1><p>Someone reading the above discussion might object, saying</p><blockquote>That seems right... but I still feel like there are some people who can't learn calculus, or learn to code no matter how hard they try. And I don't feel like this is just them not taking prerequisites seriously or lack of motivation. I feel like it's a fundamental limitation in their brain, and this produces a large amount of variation in learning ability.</blockquote><p>I agree with this to an extent.<span><style>.mjx-chtml {display: inline-block; line-height: 0; text-indent: 0; text-align: left; text-transform: none; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 100%; font-size-adjust: none; letter-spacing: normal; word-wrap: normal; word-spacing: normal; white-space: nowrap; float: none; direction: ltr; max-width: none; max-height: none; min-width: 0; min-height: 0; border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 1px 0}

[...] You can often make a machine worse by breaking a random piece, but this does not mean that the machine was easy to design or that you can make the machine better by adding a random piece. Similarly, levels of variation of cognitive performance in humans may tell us very little about the difficulty of making a human-level intelligence smarter.</blockquote><blockquote>In the extreme case, we can observe that brain-dead humans often have very similar cognitive architectures. But this does not mean that it is easy to start from an AI at the level of a dead human and reach one at the level of a living human.</blockquote><p>Imagine lining up 100 identical machines that produce widgets. At the beginning they all produce widgets at the same pace. But if I go to each machine and break a random part -- a different one for each machine -- some will stop working completely. Others will continue working, but will sometimes spontaneously fail. Others will slow down their performance, and produce fewer widgets. Others still will continue unimpeded since the broken part was unimportant. This is all despite the fact that the machines are nearly identical in design space!</p><p>If a human cannot learn calculus, even after trying their hardest, and putting in the hours, I would attribute this fact to a learning deficit. In other words, they have a 'broken part.' Learning deficits can be small things: I often procrastinate on Reddit rather than doing tasks that I should be doing. People's minds drift off when they're listening to lectures, finding the material to be boring. </p><p>The brightest people are the ones who can use the full capacity of their brains to learn the task. In other words, the baseline of human performance is set by people who have no 'broken parts.' Among those people, the people with no harmful mutations or cognitive deficits, I expect human learning ability to be extremely similar. Unfortunately there aren't really any humans who fit this description, and thus we see some variation, even for humans near the top.</p><h1>Appendix</h1><h2>What about other theories?</h2><p>There have been numerous proposed theories that I have seen. Here are a few posts:</p><p><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/QqHhr9anrSnZRHCxf/why-so-much-variance-in-human-intelligence"">Why so much variance in human intelligence?</a> by Ben Pace. This question prompted the community to find reasons for the above phenomenon. None of the answers quite match my response, hence why I created this post. Still, I think a few of the replies were onto something and worth reading.</p><p><a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/08/02/where-the-falling-einstein-meets-the-rising-mouse/"">Where the Falling Einstein Meets the Rising Mouse</a>, a post on SlateStarCodex. Scott Alexander introduces a few of his own theories, such as the idea that humans are simply lightyears above animals in abilities. While this theory seems plausible in some domains, I did not ultimately find it compelling. In light of the learning ability distinction, however, I <em>do</em> think we are lightyears above many animals in learning.</p><p><a href=""https://aiimpacts.org/is-the-range-of-human-intelligence-small/"">The range of human intelligence</a> by Katja Grace. Her post prompted me to write this one. I agree that there is a large variation in human <em>abilities</em> but I felt that the lack of a coherent distinction between <em>learning</em> and <em>competence</em> ultimately made the argument rest on a confusion. As for whether this alters our perception of a more continuous takeoff, I am not so sure. I think the implications are non-obvious.</p><h2>Where did the learning/competence distinction come from?</h2><p>To the best of my knowledge, Eric Drexler kindled the idea. However, I do know that many people have made the distinction in the past; I just haven't really seen it applied to this debate in particular.</p><hr class=""dividerBlock""><p> <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""^1""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char""></span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sup"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: 0.513em; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mn"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">1</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> However, I do think that most people are probably able to learn calculus, and how to code. I agree with Sal Khan who <a href=""https://www.ted.com/talks/sal_khan_let_s_teach_for_mastery_not_test_scores/transcript?language=en"">says</a>, </p><blockquote>If we were to go 400 years into the past to Western Europe, which even then, was one of the more literate parts of the planet, you would see that about 15 percent of the population knew how to read. And I suspect that if you asked someone who did know how to read, say a member of the clergy, ""What percentage of the population do you think is even capable of reading?"" They might say, ""Well, with a great education system, maybe 20 or 30 percent."" But if you fast forward to today, we know that that prediction would have been wildly pessimistic, that pretty close to 100 percent of the population is capable of reading. But if I were to ask you a similar question: ""What percentage of the population do you think is capable of truly mastering calculus, or understanding organic chemistry, or being able to contribute to cancer research?"" A lot of you might say, ""Well, with a great education system, maybe 20, 30 percent."" </blockquote><p>Edit: I want to point out that this optimism is <em>not </em>a crux for my main argument.</p>",matthew-barnett,matthew-barnett,Matthew Barnett,

While the journal's version of record is behind a paywall, a preprint is available on arXiv at  <a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.00068.pdf"">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.00068.pdf</a>.   </p><p>This paper argues for my very deeply held belief that <em>we can make significant advances in quantitative reasoning for medical decision making by thinking more closely about effect heterogeneity and how this relates to the choice of effect scale.</em> </p><hr class=""dividerBlock""><p>Over the course of the last 7 years, external validity and generalizability have become increasingly hot topics in statistical methodology and computer science. In particular, a lot of progress has been made by Judea Pearl and Elias Bareinboim, who introduced a framework based on causal diagrams that can be used to reason about how to take causal information from one setting (for example: a randomized trial) and apply it in a different setting (for example: a clinically relevant target population). </p><p>The key questions of interest are:  How do we know whether such extrapolation is even possible? How do we determine what information we need from the study, and what information we need from the target population, in order to extrapolate the findings? How do we put this information together in order to obtain a valid prediction for what happens if the intervention is implemented in the target population?</p><p>Pearl and Bareinboim's framework for answering these questions is, of course, mathematically valid. However, in my opinion, their approach also throws the baby out with the bathwater.  In particular, we argue that instead of attempting to extrapolate the magnitude of the effect (i.e. a measure of the ""size"" of the difference between what happens if the drug is taken, and what happens if the drug is not taken), they attempt to look at the people who were assigned to receive the intervention in the study, and extrapolate their distribution of outcomes to the target population <em>without any reference to how that distribution differs from what happened to the people who were randomized to the control condition</em>.</p><p>Theoretically, this approach will work if the extrapolation procedure can account for every cause of the outcome whose distribution differs between the people who were in the study, and the people you are trying to make predictions about. However, since the set of causes of the outcome is very large, it is very unlikely that it is possible to measure all of them. Moreover, it is very likely that we do not even know what the causes of the outcome are. Our inferences then become subject to potential uncertainty which arises from the auxiliary assumption that we know what to control for.</p><p>Consider a situation where scientists have conducted a randomized controlled trial in men, on the effects of homeopathy on heart disease. The scientists find that homeopathy has no effects in men, and wonder whether this finding can be extrapolated to women. If the scientists attempt to answer this question using Bareinboim and Pearl's framework, they will be forced to conclude that no extrapolation can be made, unless they are willing to claim that they know all the causes of heart disease that differ between men and women, and have been able to measure every one of these causes in all the patients in the study.  </p><hr class=""dividerBlock""><p>In contrast, we suggest that scientists who want to extrapolate their findings and make predictions outside of the study should attempt to quantify the size of the effect - that is, by how much the outcomes in the people who were randomized to receive the intervention differ from the outcomes in the people who were randomized to the control condition. This effect size could then potentially be used as the basis for extrapolation. Such an approach would correspond much closer to how external validity and extrapolation has traditionally been understood in the medical literature. </p><p>In the real world of clinical medicine, doctors are usually given information about the effects of a drug on the risk ratio scale (the probability of the outcome if treated, divided by the probability of the outcome if untreated). With information on the risk ratio, a doctor may make a prediction for what will happen to the patient if treated, by multiplying the risk ratio and patient's risk if untreated (which is predicted informally based on observable markers for the patient's condition). </p><p>The problem with this approach is that there are multiple scales on which to quantify the magnitude of the effect. Other possible scales for measuring effects include:</p><ul><li>The odds ratio, which applies a <span><style>.mjx-chtml {display: inline-block; line-height: 0; text-indent: 0; text-align: left; text-transform: none; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 100%; font-size-adjust: none; letter-spacing: normal; word-wrap: normal; word-spacing: normal; white-space: nowrap; float: none; direction: ltr; max-width: none; max-height: none; min-width: 0; min-height: 0; border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 1px 0}

This is, of course, a serious problem for principled clinical decision-making, but as we will show, it is not necessarily an impossible one. </p><p>Despite the scale dependence of the reasoning procedure, the risk ratio is in many cases the only summary of the effect size that is made available to clinicians, whether they get their information from journals, clinical guidelines or online resources for clinical information. Given that the reasoning procedure is not scale-invariant, the universal reliance on the risk ratio may plausibly lead to suboptimal medical decision making in a wide range of clinical scenarios.

I am not going to repeat the argument in full here, but I will ask you to consider the following highly stylized thought experiment, which illustrates the underlying intuition:</p><hr class=""dividerBlock""><p>Consider a randomized controlled trial where the intervention is that everyone is randomized to play Russian roulette once a year. This trial is conducted in Russia. It is found that among those who did not play Russian roulette, 1% of people died over the course of the year. Among the people who played Russian roulette, 18% of people died. We want to extrapolate these findings to Norway, where nobody ordinarily plays Russian roulette and it is known that 0.5% of people die during any year. Our goal is to find out what happens in Norway if everyone took up playing Russian roulette once a year. </p><p>Bareinboim and Pearl would suggest taking the risk of death among those who played Russian roulette (18%), controlling for all causes of death that differ between Russia and Norway, and producing an estimate for what happens in Norway if everyone plays Russian roulette. However, due to considerable differences between Russia and Norway in terms of predictors of mortality, this is clearly not feasible in this situation.  </p><p>If we instead attempt to quantify the effect size in Russia, this can be done on any of the previously discussed scales:  </p><ul><li>The risk ratio is <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\frac{0.18}{0.01} = 18""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mfrac""><span class=""mjx-box MJXc-stacked"" style=""width: 1.399em;

The front door to our apartment doesn't really have space to swing.
When we first moved in it opened to the right, blocking part of the
hallway and keeping you from carrying groceries straight through to
the kitchen:



</p><p>

<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/unit2-door-right-big.png""><img src=""https://www.jefftk.com/unit2-door-right.png"" /></a>

</p>

<p>

This was annoying, so after some discussion with housemates I turned
it around:

</p>

<p>

<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/unit2-door-left-big.png""><img src=""https://www.jefftk.com/unit2-door-left.png"" /></a>

</p>

<p>

In practice this is maybe better, maybe worse, still pretty annoying.

</p>

<p>

We've considered removing the door:

</p>

<p>

<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/unit2-door-absent-big.png""><img src=""https://www.jefftk.com/unit2-door-absent.png"" /></a>

</p>

<p>

But this would let kid-noise carry more down to Julia's office,
wouldn't work if we had a housemate with a small child or cat, and if
at some point the people downstairs were not close friends it would be
a little weird.

</p>

<p>

We could have the door open out instead:

</p>

<p>

<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/unit2-door-out-big.png""><img src=""https://www.jefftk.com/unit2-door-out.png"" /></a>

</p>

<p>

But this would be too awkward to open, since the landing is so
small that the door kind of needs to swing through you.

</p>

<p>

So, it currently still looks like:

</p>

<p>

<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/unit2-door-left-big.png""><img src=""https://www.jefftk.com/unit2-door-left.png"" /></a>

</p>

<p>

One idea is I could cut it down the middle, and let it fold a second
time:

</p>

<p>

<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/unit2-door-double-left-big.png""><img src=""https://www.jefftk.com/unit2-door-double-left.png"" /></a>

</p>

<p>

This gets it out of the way when it's open, but at the cost of having
a really very large swing.

</p>

<p>

Perhaps the door should open in the middle?

Very narrow for a double door, and it still sticks out a bit on the
left.  There's extra space on the right, though, so you could make it
asymmetrical?

This would be a bit more work, but we could put a track on the ceiling that allowed the door to slide around a curve, opening outwards but with a much reduced sweep:

<p>Metalworking is one of the oldest crafts, going back far beyond recorded history. But until a few thousand years ago, one of the most abundant metals—iron—was virtually unknown. The ancient Egyptians and Sumerians knew iron only from meteors, and considered it heavenly, a gift from the gods. Later civilizations discovered how to smelt it, and their period came to be known as the Iron Age, but they didn’t know how to consistently make it strong, and not brittle. During the Industrial Revolution, we discovered how to make it strong, consistent, and even cheap.</p>
<p>Now high-quality steel is everywhere around us: holding up our buildings (in both girders and reinforced <a href=""https://rootsofprogress.org/instant-stone-just-add-water"">concrete</a>), in our cars and ships, in trains and their rails, in bridges and towers, in <a href=""https://rootsofprogress.org/why-ac-won"">electrical infrastructure</a>, in refrigerators and washing machines, in pots and pans, in forks and knives, in hammers and saws, in nails and screws, in tables and chairs.</p>
<p>The wonder of the metal is gone, but the wonder of the process remains. A steel foundry is an amazing sight, with enormous blast furnaces several stories high, raging at thousands of degrees 24/7, attended by a swarm of workers, like a great beast with an insatiable hunger for ore, coke, and lime.</p>
<p>The product they put out is of such purity and consistency that it would be hailed by the ancients as a miracle, a feat of craftsmanship possible only through divine intervention. But in the modern economy, it is a commodity.</p>
<p>What is this material? Why is it so hard to make? And how did it go from mythical to mundane?</p>

[Bacon adds two even more obscure technical terms, semi-apologising for them; they don’t occur again in this work. Then:] Subordinate to these primary works are two secondary and less important ones. Under the ‘power’ heading: turning concrete bodies into something different, so far as this is possible—·e.g. turning lead into gold, if this can be done·. Under the ‘knowledge’ heading:</p><p><strong>(i)</strong> in every case of generation and motion, discovering the <em>hidden</em> process through which the end-state form results from the <em>manifest</em> efficient ·cause· and the <em>manifest</em> material; and<br><strong>(ii)</strong> discovering the hidden microstructure of bodies that are not changing.</p><p>·An example of <strong>(i)</strong>: the wax around the wick of a lighted candle melts. Flame is the efficient cause, wax is the material, and meltedness is the end-state form. But ‘flame’ and ‘wax’ stand for items that are <em>manifest</em>, obvious, out there on the surface; we know that when you apply one to the other you get melting; but that isn’t knowing what <em>hidden</em> process is involved—what is <em>really basically going on</em> at the sub-microscopic level when flame melts wax·. ·An example of <strong>(ii)</strong>: discovering what the sub-microscopic structure is of wax when it isn’t melting·.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Human knowledge is in a poor state these days—<em>how</em> poor can be seen from things that are commonly said. ·Not that they are <em>all</em> wrong·.</p><blockquote>True knowledge is knowledge by causes. Causes are of four kinds: material, formal, efficient, and final.</blockquote><p>[A coin’s •material cause is the metal, its •formal cause is the property of being round-with-a-head-inscribed-on-it etc., its immediate •efficient cause is the stamping of a die on the metal, and its •final cause is its purpose, use in commerce.]</p><p>So far, so good; but ·the concept of· <em>final cause</em> spoils the sciences rather than furthering them, except in contexts involving human action. The discovery of formal causes is despaired of. Efficient and material causes ·are real and solid and important, but they· are investigated and believed in ·only as they appear on things’ surfaces·, without reference to the hidden process through which the end-state form comes about; and, taken in <em>that</em> way, they are slight and superficial, and contribute little or nothing to true and active science. Earlier in this work [<a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/GTEay24Lxm3xoE4hy/p/GRGk3468ozwrHPYkm"">1-<strong>51</strong></a>] I noted as an error of the human mind the opinion that to understand what exists you have to look at forms. It’s true that nature really contains only</p><blockquote>individual bodies, performing individual pure actions (<em>actus purus) </em>according to a fixed law;</blockquote><p>[Bacon doesn’t explain <em>actus purus</em>. In each of its other three occurrences he connects it with <em>laws</em>, and his meaning seems to be something like: ‘the laws governing the pure actions of individual things, i.e. the things they do because of their own natures independently of interference from anything else’. If x does A partly because of influence from something else y, then x is not purely •active in respect of A because y’s influence gives A a certain degree of •passivity. From here on, <em>actus purus</em> will be translated by ‘pure action’.]</p><p>but in science this <em>law</em> is what we inquire into, discover, and explain; it is at the root of our theorizing as well as of our practical applications. When I speak ·approvingly· of ‘forms’, what I’m talking about is this law. . . .; I use the word ‘form’ because it has become familiar.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> If someone knows the cause of a nature such as whiteness or heat in <em>only some</em> subjects, his •knowledge is incomplete; and if he can produce a certain effect in <em>only some</em> of the substances that are capable of it, his •power is incomplete. Now efficient and material causes</p><ul><li>are unstable causes, ·i.e. they can’t be depended on to act in the same way in all cases·;</li><li>they are nothing but <em>vehicles</em> ·in which the operative hidden structures and causes are carried·;</li><li>they are causes that convey the ·end-state· form in <em>only some</em> cases.</li></ul><p>If a man’s knowledge is confined to <em>them</em>, he may arrive at new discoveries ·that hold generally about· some pre-selected class of fairly similar substances; but he doesn’t get to the fixed, deeper boundaries of things—·‘fixed’ in contrast to the ‘unstable’ nature of manifest causes·. But someone who knows <em>forms</em> gets hold of the unity of nature in things that are ·superficially· most unalike, and this enables him to discover and bring to light really new things—things that no-one would ever have thought of, and that would never have come to light in the course of nature, or through deliberate experiments, or even by accident. So the discovery of forms leads to truth in theory-building and freedom in operation.</p><p><strong>4.</strong> The roads to human power and to human knowledge lie extremely close together and are nearly the same. Still, because of the bad old habit of thinking in terms of abstractions, it is safer to get the sciences started and to carry them on from foundations that have to do with their <em>practical</em> part, and to let the practical part itself be a stamp of authenticity and also a limit-setter for the purely theoretical part. Well, then, let’s think about a man who wants to confer some nature on a given body; he wants, for instance, to give a piece of silver the yellow colour that gold has or to make it heavier (subject to the laws of matter), or he wants to make an opaque stone transparent, or to make glass sticky, or to get something that isn’t a plant to grow. Our question should be: what kind of rule or direction or guidance should he most wish for? And we should answer this in the simplest and plainest terms ·that we can find·. <strong>(1)</strong> He will undoubtedly want to be shown something that won’t let him down or fail when it is put to the test. <strong>(2)</strong> He will want a rule that won’t tie him down to this or that particular means and mode of operation. Otherwise he may be stuck: he doesn’t have the prescribed means, others are available and would do the job, but the rule he is to follow doesn’t allow them. <strong>(3)</strong> He will want to be shown a procedure that isn’t as difficult as the thing he wants to do—·e.g. he won’t want to be told ‘To make that silver yellow like gold, you must make it yellow like gold’·; he’ll want something more practicable than that.</p><p>A true and complete rule of operation, then, will have to be a proposition that is <strong>(1)</strong> certain, <strong>(2)</strong> not constricting and <strong>(3)</strong> practicable. And the same holds for the discovery of a true form. For the form of a nature is such that:</p><ul><li>given the form, the nature is sure to follow; so that the form is absent whenever the nature is absent. . . .</li></ul><p>and is also such that</p><ul><li>if the form is taken away, the nature is sure to vanish; so that the form is present whenever the nature is present. . . .</li></ul><p>[Bacon ties each ‘so that. . . ’ clause to the wrong proposition—a mere slip, here corrected, rather than a logical error.]</p><p>Lastly,</p><ul><li>the true form derives the given nature from some essence that many other also things have and that is (as they say) b<em>etter known to nature </em>than the form ·we are discussing·.</li></ul><p>[In calling something ‘known to nature’ Bacon means that it is a general law of nature; ‘better known by nature’ could mean ‘a more general law of nature’ or ‘a generality that is more completely lawlike’.]</p><p>Here, then, is the procedure that I urge you to follow to get a true and perfect axiom of knowledge concerning a nature N₁: discover some other nature N₂ that is •convertible with N₁ and is •a special case of some more general nature N₃, falling under it as ·a true species falls· under a true and real genus. Now these two directions, the active ·rule of operation· and the contemplative ·rule of discovery·, are one and the same thing; what is most useful in operation is what is most true in knowledge.</p><p><strong>5.</strong> There are two kinds of rule or axiom for the transformation of bodies. The first regards a body as a company or collection of simple natures. In gold, for example, the following properties meet:</p><ul><li>it is yellow in colour,</li><li>it is heavy up to a certain weight,</li><li>it is malleable and ductile up to a certain length,</li><li>it doesn’t vaporize or lose any of its substance through the action of fire,</li><li>it turns into a liquid with a certain degree of fluidity;</li><li>it is separated and dissolved by such-and-such means;</li></ul><p>and so on for the other natures that come together in gold. This ·first· kind of axiom derives the thing from the forms of its simple natures. Someone who knows •the forms of yellowness, weight, ductility, fixity, fluidity, dissolving and so on, and •the methods for giving them to bodies, and •their intensities and varieties, will work to have them come together in some body which will thereby be transformed into gold. This kind of operation pertains to the primary kind of action; ·the fact that it involves many natures doesn’t mean that it is a later, non-basic kind of event·. For the principle of generating many simple natures is the same as that of generating just one; except that the investigator is more tightly constrained if more than one nature is involved, because of the difficulty of bringing together so many natures that don’t easily combine except in the well-trodden ordinary paths of nature. Anyway, ·despite that drawback· it must be said that this mode of operation that looks to simple natures in a compound body starts from what in nature is constant and eternal and universal, ·namely <em>natures</em>·, and opens broad roads to human power—ones that in the present state of things human thought can scarcely take in.</p><p>The second kind of axiom depends on the discovery of hidden processes. It doesn’t start off from simple natures, but from compound bodies just as they are found in the ordinary course of nature. For example, one might be inquiring into the origins of gold or some other metal or stone—How does it start forming? What process takes it from its basic rudiments or elements right through to the completed mineral? Or, similarly, the question of how plants are generated—What process takes the plant from the first congealing of sap in the ground, or from seeds, right through to the formed plant. . . .? Similarly ·we might inquire into· the process of development in the generation of animals from the beginning right through to birth; and similarly with other bodies.</p><p>This investigation concerns not only the •generation of bodies but also other motions and operations of nature. For example, we can inquire into •nutrition, the whole continuous series of events leading from the swallowing of the food through to its complete assimilation. Or into •voluntary motion in animals, from the first impression on the imagination and the continuous efforts of the spirits through to the flexing and moving of limbs. Or into •what is involved in the motion of the tongue and lips and other organs right through to the uttering of articulate sounds. Each of these inquiries relates to natures that have been concretized, i.e. brought together into a single structure; they concern what may be called particular and special practices of nature, not its basic and universal laws that constitute <em>forms</em>. ·That drawback of this approach is balanced by an advantage that it has over the other·. It has to be admitted that this second approach seems to have less baggage and to lie nearer at hand and to give more ground for hope than the first approach, ·i.e. the one described first in this aphorism·.</p><p>The practical-experimental approach corresponding to this ·second· theoretical approach starts from ordinary familiar natural events and moves on from them to ones that are very like them or at least not too unlike. But ·the merits of the first approach mustn’t be forgotten·. Any deep and radical operations on nature depend entirely on the primary axioms, ·which are the business of the first approach·. And then there are the matters where we have no power to <em>operate</em> but only to <em>know</em>, for example the heavenly bodies (for we can’t operate on them, alter them, or turn them into something else). With <em>these</em> things, whether we are investigating the facts about what happens in the heavens or trying to understand why it happens, we have to depend on the primary and universal axioms concerning simple natures, such as the nature of spontaneous rotation, of attraction or magnetism, and of many others that apply to more things than just to the heavenly bodies. ‘Does the earth rotate daily, or do the heavens revolve around it?’ Don’t think you have a hope of answering this before you have understood the nature of spontaneous rotation.</p><p><strong>6.</strong> The hidden process of which I speak is utterly different from anything that would occur to men in the present state of the human mind. For what I understand by it is not</p><ul><li>the different stages—different •s<em>teps—</em>that bodies can be •seen to go through in their development,</li></ul><p>but rather</p><ul><li>a perfectly •continuous process which mostly •escapes the senses.</li></ul><p>For instance: in all generation and transformation of bodies, we must inquire into</p><ul><li>what is lost and escapes, what remains, what is added;</li><li>what is expanded, what is contracted;</li><li>what is united, what is separated;</li><li>what is continued, what is cut off;</li><li>what pushes, what blocks;</li><li>what predominates, what gives way;</li></ul><p>and a variety of other particulars. And it’s not just with the generation or transformation of bodies, but with all other alterations and motions we should inquire into</p><ul><li>what goes before, what comes after;</li><li>what is quicker, what is slower;</li><li>what produces motion, what ·merely· guides it;</li></ul><p>and so on. In the present state of the sciences (in which stupidity is interwoven with clumsiness) no-one knows or does anything about any of these matters. For seeing that every natural action takes place</p><p><strong>Latin:</strong> <em>per minima</em></p><p><strong>possibly meaning:</strong> by means of the smallest particles</p><p><strong>or it might mean:</strong> by smallest steps, i.e. continuously</p><p>or at least by ones that are too small to strike the senses, no-one can hope to govern or change nature unless he understands and observes such action in the right way.</p><p><strong>7.</strong> Similarly, the investigation and discovery of the hidden •microstructure in bodies is something new, as new as the discovery of the hidden •process and of the •form. At this time we are merely lingering in nature’s outer courts, and we aren’t preparing a way into its inner chambers. Yet no-one can give a body a new nature, or successfully and appropriately turn it into a new ·kind of· body without first getting a competent knowledge of the body so to be altered or transformed. Without that, he will run into methods that are worthless or at best cumbersome and wrongly ordered and unsuitable to the nature of the body he is working on. So that is clearly another road that must be opened up and fortified.</p><p>It’s true that some good useful work has been done on the anatomy of organized bodies such as men and animals; it seems to have been done subtly and to have been a good search of nature. [The phrase ‘organized bodies’ refers to <em>organisms</em>; but the adjective ‘organized’ emphasizes the idea of a body with different parts <em>of different kinds</em>, unlike such seemingly homogeneous bodies as lumps of lead.] But this kind of anatomizing lies within the visible range and is subject to the senses; also, it applies only to organized bodies. And it’s obvious and easy compared with the true anatomizing of the hidden microstructure in bodies that are thought to be the same all through, ·i.e. homogeneous·; especially in things (and their parts) that have a specific character, such as iron and stone; and homogeneous parts of plants and animals, such as the root, the leaf, the flower, flesh, blood, bones and so on. But there has been <em>some</em> human industry even on this kind of thing; because this is just what men are aiming at when they break up homogeneous bodies by means of distillation and other kinds of analysis so as to reveal how the complex structure ·of the <em>seemingly</em> homogeneous compound· comes from combination of its various homogeneous parts. This is useful too, and is the kind of thing I am recommending; but in practice it often gives the wrong answer, because the procedures that are used—fire, heat, and so on—sometimes <em>create</em> new natures, which the scientist thinks existed in the compound before and were merely brought into the open by the separation procedure. Anyway, this is only a small part of the work of discovering the true microstructure of the compound body—a structure that is far more subtle and detailed ·than these processes could discover·. The operation of fire doesn’t reveal and clarify this structure—it scrambles it.</p><p>So the way to separate and analyse bodies is not by fire but by reasoning and true induction, with experiments in a helping role; and by comparison with other bodies, and reduction to simple natures and their forms which meet and mix in the compound. In short, we must pass from Vulcan to Minerva—·from physical activities to intelligent mental ones·—if we want to bring to light the true •textures and •microstructures of bodies. It is on •these that depend all the hidden properties and powers of things, and all their so-called <em>specific</em> properties and powers. They are also the source of every effective alteration and transformation. For example, we must inquire what each body contains in the way of •spirit, and what of •tangible stuff; and regarding the spirit we should inquire into whether it is</p><ul><li>plentiful (making the body swollen) or meagre and scarce;</li><li>fine or coarse,</li><li>more like air than like fire, or vice versa,</li><li>vigorous or sluggish,</li><li>weak or strong,</li><li>increasing or decreasing,</li><li>broken up or continuous,</li><li>agreeing or disagreeing with objects in the external environment,</li></ul><p>and so on. Similarly, we must inquire into the tangible stuff (which is just as variable as spirit)—into its hairs, its fibres, its kinds of texture. Other things that fall within the scope of this inquiry are: •how the spirit is distributed through the bodily mass, with its pores, passages, veins and cells; and •the rudiments or first attempts at organic body. In these inquiries, and thus in all discoveries relating to hidden microstructure, the primary axioms cast a true and clear light which entirely dispels darkness and subtlety.</p><p><strong>8.</strong> ·Three fears that you might have can be allayed·: </p><p><strong>(1)</strong> This won’t lead us to the doctrine of <em>atoms</em>, which presupposes •that there is a vacuum and •that matter doesn’t change—which are both false. All we shall be led to are <em>real particles</em>—which ·are not merely hypothesized but· have been discovered. </p><p><strong>(2)</strong> Don’t be afraid that all this will be so subtle—·so complex and fine-grained in its detail·—that it will become unintelligible. On the contrary, the nearer our inquiry gets to simple natures the more straightforward and transparent everything will become. The whole affair will be a matter of getting</p><ul><li>from the complicated to the simple,</li><li>from the incommensurable to the commensurable,</li><li>from the random to the calculable,</li><li>from the infinite and vague to the finite and certain,</li></ul><p>like the case of the letters of the alphabet and the notes of music. Inquiries into nature have the best result when they begin with physics and end in mathematics. </p><p><strong>(3)</strong> Don’t be afraid of large numbers or tiny fractions. In dealing with numbers it is as easy to write or think <em>a thousand</em> or <em>a thousandth</em> as to write or think <em>one</em>.</p><p><strong>9.</strong> From the two kinds of axioms that I have spoken of [<strong>5</strong>] arises a sound division of philosophy and the sciences. The investigation of forms, which are. . . .eternal and immutable, constitutes <strong>Metaphysics</strong>; the investigation of efficient causes, of matter, of hidden processes and of hidden microstructures—all of which concern the common and ordinary course of nature, not its eternal and fundamental laws—constitutes <strong>Physics</strong>. Each of these has a subordinate <em>practical</em> branch: physics has <strong>mechanics</strong>; and metaphysics has what in a cleaned-up sense of the word I call <strong>magic</strong>, on account of its sweeping ways and its greater command over nature. ‘Metaphysics’ etc. are the most accurate labels for these categories, but I am understanding them in senses that agree with my views.</p><p><em>The next post in the sequence will be posted Thursday, October 31 at latest by 4:00pm PT.</em></p>",Francis Bacon,francis-bacon,Francis Bacon,

Hosted by Mel at the Berkeley REACH, usually Tuesdays.</p>
<p>Expectations</p>
<ul>
<li>Court is held in a sitting circle. One may lead, but it is always a choice to follow or not.</li>
<li>Each person decides and adopt their Role: a mindset to take, or an objective to meet in this time.  The center of the circle holds a collection of suggested roles for beginners. Advanced members consider what is genuinely the most important thing they could accomplish with their next few hours.</li>
<li>The court breaks for 5 minutes to take any quick immediate actions which would resolve or advance their goal. After, anyone who wishes to share some insights on their role or action may do so.</li>
<li>Court proceeds in a circle, each person in turn initiates an exercise from a grab-bag of discussion prompts and short activities. They might follow the list recommended by the organizer, or suggest their own. Each exercise aims to practice a small element of individual curiosity and epistemic skill, or group coordination.</li>
<li>Optionally give feedback to the organizer</li>
<li>Say closing thoughts and goodbyes</li>
</ul>
<p>Guidelines</p>
<ul>
<li>To do what works for you and decline what does not is no insult. Participation is always at-will, anyone is free to jump in or out for whatever reason.</li>
<li>To register objection is no act of defection, and to visibly dissent is no act of sabotage. Nor should any compel you to detail your reasoning, for important lines of thought do sometimes shy from discourse.</li>
<li>The point of learning is not to come to the same conclusion as one's instructors: the bottom line is not yet written.</li>
<li>Be creators and teachers yourselves, not consumers. If a practice passes muster, pass it on.</li>
</ul>
<p>“God bless our good and gracious King,
Whose promise none relies on;
Who never said a foolish thing,
Nor ever did a wise one.”
― John Wilmot</p>
<p>“You can learn new things at any time in your life if you're willing to be a beginner. If you actually learn to like being a beginner, the whole world opens up to you.”
― Barbara Sher</p>
<p>“I cannot teach anybody anything. I can only make them think”
― Socrates</p>
<p>“Knowledge is a treasure, but practice is the key to it.”
― Lao Tzu</p>

This particular construction has ambiguity in the use of the word ""I"" to refer to both the real and counterfactual agent, which is the root of the <a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/5-and-10"">5-and-10 problem</a>. The Functional Decision Theory of <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05060"">Yudkowsky and Soares (2017)</a> provides a more formal version of this construction, but suffers from (a more explicit version of) the same ambiguity by taking as its counterfactuals logical statements about its own decision function, some of which must necessarily be false. This poses an issue for an <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/Rm6oQRJJmhGCcLvxh/p/p7x32SEt43ZMC9r7r"">embedded agent</a> implementing FDT, which, knowing itself to be part of its environment, might presumably therefore determine the full structure of its own decision function, and subsequently run into trouble when it can derive a contradiction from its counterlogical assumptions.</p>
<p><a href=""https://intelligence.org/files/DeathInDamascus.pdf"">Soares and Levenstein (2017)</a> explore this issue but defer it to future development of ""a non-trivial theory of logical counterfactuals"" (p. 1). I've been trying to explore a different approach: replacing the core counterfactual question of ""what if my algorithm had a different output?"" with ""what if an agent with a different algorithm were in my situation?"". Yudkowsky and Soares (2017) consider a related approach, but dismiss it:</p>

Yesterday afternoon I got excited about a new design for a brass
instrument.  Conical bore instruments have the problem that you can't
combine valves (or slides) with having the tubing consistently expand
over the length of the instrument.  The valves force you to have a
cylindrical bore segment in the center, and while you can 

<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._A._Couturier"">design the
tubing</a> to minimize the cylindrical segment, you do have to have
some.



</p><p>

Or do you?  Imagine you have seven bells, with a single rotary valve
that has seven positions, one for each bell.  You use the standard
fingering, with keys to rotate the valve 1/7, 2/7, and 3/7.  This gets
you approximately the same options for tubing length as a standard
brass instrument, except that you no longer need to make <a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/trumpets-belong-in-c"">compromises</a>: pushing in all three
keys brings you down exactly six half steps and you don't need a
tuning slide to compensate.  You can play chromatically, and you play
it just like a trumpet, baritone, or tuba.

</p>

<p>

It looks like Adolphe Sax <a href=""http://www.mim.be/trombone-with-7-bells"">tried something like
this</a>, but with six two-position piston valves instead of a
seven-position rotary valve, and he was just trying to solve the
tuning problem and not the bore problem:

</p>

<p>

<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/seven-bell-six-valve-trombone-big.jpg""><img src=""https://www.jefftk.com/seven-bell-six-valve-trombone.jpg"" /></a>

</p>

<p>

But then I found something even weirder:
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvkl4IcPuzM"">1</a>,
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSlMWSwlY78"">2</a>,
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fxc29ESYxg"">3</a>,
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxC8FC2DR2U"">4</a>,
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVQHhOraeTg"">5</a>.

</p><p>

It turns out there's a somewhat successful instrument along these
lines, but for totally different reasons.  Instead of being optimized
for tone, it's optimized for being easy to play.  Each instrument has
one horn per note, typically eight, so a range of just eight notes.
The base of each horn has a reed, so you don't need any sort of
embouchure, you just blow.  See <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2d-6SY2Uqg#t=165"">this
video</a> where someone takes one apart to demonstrate.  They seem to
be German; to find more videos search for ""Schalmeien"", while if you
want to buy one (please don't) search for ""Schalmei"".

</p>

<p>

I do think a rotary trumpet, played chromatically with trumpet
fingering, could work well though, and I'm curious whether anyone has
explored this.

So I made a few edits and the text bellow is the result.*</p><p>One of the most misunderstood ideas that&apos;s polluting the minds of  popular &quot;intellectuals&quot;, many of them seemingly accustomed with  statistics and machine learning, is the potential or threat that  developing an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence"">artificial general intelligence</a> (AGI) would present to our civilization.</p><p>This myth stems from two misunderstanding of reality. </p><p>One such misunderstanding is related to the refinement and  extensibility of current ML algorithms and FPA hardware, however  discussing that always leads of people arguing &quot;what ifs&quot; (e.g What if  cheap quantum computers with very efficient I/O become a thing ?), thus,  I won&apos;t pursue that line of thought here.</p><p>A second, more easy to debunk misunderstanding, is related to the  practicality of an AGI. Assuming that our wildest dreams of hardware  were to come true&#x2026; would we be able to create and AGI and would this AGI  actually have any effect upon the world other than being a fun  curiosity ?</p><h2>1. We already have AGIs</h2><p>AGI is here, as of the time of writing there are an estimate of  7,714,576,923 AGI algorithms residing upon our planet. You can use the  vast majority of them for less than 2$/hour. They can accomplish the  vast majority intellectual task that can be well-defined by humans, not  to mention they can invent new tasks themselves.</p><p>They are capable of creating new modified version of themselves,  updating their own algorithms, sharing their algorithms with other AGIs  and learning new complex skills. To add to that, they are energy  efficient, you can keep one running for optimally for 5 to 50$/day  depending on location, much less than your average server farm used to  train a complex ML model.</p><p>This is a rather obvious observation, but one that needs to be noted  nonetheless. Nobody has ever complained about the severe lack of humans  in the world. If I were to ask anyone what they would envision as making  a huge positive impact upon the future, few would answer vastly  increasing birth rates.</p><p>So, if we are agreed on the fact that 70 billion people wouldn&apos;t be  much better than 7 billion, that is to say, adding brains doesn&apos;t scale  linearly&#x2026; why are we under the assumption that artificial brains would  help ?</p><p>If we disagree on that assumption, than what&apos;s stopping the value of  human mental labor from sky-rocketing if it&apos;s in such demand ? What&apos;s  stopping hundreds of millions of people with perfectly average working  brains from finding employment ?</p><p>Well, you could argue, it&apos;s about the quality of the intelligence,  not all humans are intellectually equal. Having a few million artificial  Joe nobody wouldn&apos;t help the world much, but having even a few dozen  Von Neumanns would make a huge difference. Or, even better, it&apos;s about  having an AI that&apos;s more intelligent than any human that we&apos;ve yet  encountered.</p><p>This leads me to my second point.</p><h2>2. Defining intelligence</h2><p>How does one define an intelligent human or intelligence in general ?</p><p>An IQ test is the go-to measure of human intelligence used by sociologists and psychologists.</p><p>However, algorithms can readily out-score humans in IQ tests, for a  very long time, and they are able to do so reliably with more and more <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.07909"">added constraints</a>.</p><p>The problem here is that IQ tests are designed for humans&#x2026; not machines.</p><p>But, let&apos;s assume we come up with a &quot;machine intelligence quotient&quot;  (MIQ) test that our potential AGI friends cannot use their perks to  &quot;cheat&quot; on.</p><p>But how do we design it to avoid the pitfalls of a human IQ test when  taken to the extremes ? Our purpose, after all, is not to &quot;grade&quot;  algorithms with this test in a stagnant void, but to improve them in  such a way that scoring higher on the tests means they are more  &quot;intelligent&quot; in general.</p><p>In other words, this MIQ test needs to be very efficient at spotting intelligence outliers.</p><p>If we come back to an IQ test, we&apos;ll notice it&apos;s rather inaccurate at the thin ends of the distribution.</p><p>Have you ever heard of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marilyn_vos_Savant"">Marilyn vos Savant</a> or <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Langan"">Chris Langan</a> or <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_Tao"">Terence Tao</a> or <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_James_Sidis#Politics_and_arrest_%281919%E2%80%931921%29"">William James Sidis</a> or <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Ung-yong"">Kim Ung-yong</a> ?  These are, as far as IQ tests are concerned, the most intelligence members that our species currently contains.</p><p>While I won&apos;t question their presumed intelligence, I can safely say their  achievements are rather unimpressive. Go down the list of high IQ  individuals and what you&apos;ll mostly find is rather mediocre people with a  few highly interesting quirks (can solve equations quickly, can speak a  lot of languages, can memorize a lot of things&#x2026; etc).</p><p>Once you consider the top 100,000 or so, there is most certainly a great overlap with people that have created  impressive works of engineering, designed foundational experiments,  invented theories that explain various natural phenomenon, became great  leaders&#x2026; etc (let&apos;s call these people &quot;smart&quot;, for the sake of  brevity).</p><p>But IQ is not a predictor of that, it&apos;s more of a filter. You can  almost guarantee that a highly smart person (as viewed by society)  will have a high IQ, but having the highest IQ doesn&apos;t even guarantee  you will be in the top 0.x% of &quot;smart&quot; people as defined by your achievements.</p><p>So even if we somehow manage to create this MIQ to be as good of an  indicator of whether or not a machine is intelligent as IQ is for  humans, it will still be a bad criterion of benchmark against. </p><p>Indeed, the only reason IQ is a somewhat useful marker for humans is because natural selection did not use IQ, start having some mad-scientists IQ-based human optimization farms and soon enough you might end up with individuals that can score 300 on an IQ test but can&apos;t hold civil conversations or operate in society or tie their shoelaces. </p><p>This seems like an obvious point, a good descriptor of {X} becomes bad once it starts being used as a guidelines to maximize {X}. This should be especially salient to AI researchers and anyone working in automatic differentiation based modeling, optimizing a model for a known criterion (performance on training data) does not guarantee success on future similar data (testing/validation set), indeed, optimizing it too much can lead to a worst model than stopping at some middle ground.</p><p>We might be able to say &quot;An intelligent algorithm should have an MIQ  of at least 100&quot;, but we&apos;ll hardly be able to say &quot;Having an MIQ of 500  means that an algorithm has super-human intelligence&quot;.</p><p>The problem is that we aren&apos;t intelligent enough to define  intelligent. If the definition of intelligence does exist, there is no  clear path to finding out what it is.</p><p>Even worse, I would say it&apos;s highly unlikely that the definition of  intelligence exists. What I might consider intelligent is not what you  would consider intelligent&#x2026; our definitions may overlap to some extent,  we&apos;ll likely be able to come up with a common definition of what  constitutes &quot;average&quot; intelligence (e.g. the IQ test), but they would  diverge towards the tail.</p><p>Most people will agree as to whether or not someone is somewhat  intelligent, but they will disagree to no end on a &quot;most intelligent  people in the world&quot; list.</p><p>Well, you may say, that could indeed be true, but we can judge people  by their achievements. We can disagree all day on whether or not some  high IQ individual like Chris Langan is a quack numerologist or a  misunderstood god. But we can all agree that someone like Richard  Feynman or Tom Mueller or Alan Turing is rather bright based on their  achievements alone.</p><p>Which brings me to my third point.</p><h2>3. Testing intelligence</h2><p>The problem of our hypothetical superhuman AGI, since we can&apos;t come  up with a simple test to determine it&apos;s intelligence, is that it would  have to prove itself as capable.</p><p>This can be done in three ways:</p><ol><li>Use previous data and see if the &quot;AI&quot; is able to perform on said data as well or better than humans.</li><li>Use very good simulations of the world and see if the &quot;AI&quot; is able  to achieve superhuman results competing inside said simulations.</li><li>Give the &quot;AI&quot; the resource to manifest itself in the real world and  act in much the same way the human would (with all the benefits of  having a computer for a brain).</li></ol><p>Approach number (1) is how we currently train ML algorithms, and it  has the limitation of only allowing us to train on very limited tasks  where we know all the possible &quot;paths&quot; once the task is complete.</p><p>For example, we can train a cancer detecting &quot;AI&quot; on a set of medical  imaging data, because it&apos;s rather easy to then take all of our subjects  and test whether or not they &quot;really&quot; have cancer using more expensive  methods or waiting.</p><p>It&apos;s rather hard to train a cancer curing &quot;AI&quot;, since that problem  contains &quot;what ifs&quot; that can&apos;t be explored. There are limitless  treatment options and given that a treatment fails (the person dies of  cancer)&#x2026; we can&apos;t really go back and try again to see what the &quot;correct&quot;  solution was.</p><p>I wrote <a href=""https://blog.cerebralab.com/#!/a/Confounding%20via%20experimenting"">a bit more about this problem here</a>,  if you&apos;re interested in understanding it a bit more. But, I assume that  most readers with some interest in statistics and/or machine learning  have stumbled upon this issue countless times already.</p><p>This can be solved by (2), which is creating simulations in which we  can test an infinite amount of hypothesis. The only problem being that  creating simulations is rather computationally and theoretically  expensive. </p><p>To go back to our previous example of cancer curing &quot;AI&quot;, currently  the &quot;bleeding edge&quot; of biomolecular dynamics simulation, is being able  to simulate a single medium-sized gene, in a non reactive substance, for  a few nanoseconds, by making certain intelligent assumptions that speed  up our simulation by making it a bit less realistic, on a supercomputer  worth a few dozens of millions of dollars&#x2026; Yeah, the whole simulation  idea might not work out that well after all.</p><p>Coincidentally, most phenomenon that can be easily simulated are also  the kind of phenomenon that are either very simplistic or fall into  category (1), go figure.</p><p>So we are left with approach (3), giving our hypothetical AGI the  physical resources to put its humanity-changing ideas into practice.  But&#x2026; who&apos;s going to give away those resources ? Based on what proof ?  Especially when the proposition here is that we might have to try out  millions of these AGIs before one of them is actually extremely smart,  much like we do with current ML models.</p><p>The problem, of course, is that resources are finite and controlled  by people (not in the sense that they are stagnant, but we can&apos;t create  an infinite amount of resources on demand, it takes time). Nothing of  extrinsic value is free.</p><p>Which leads me to my fourth point about AGI being useless.</p><h2>4. The problem of gradual tool building</h2><p>The process by which humanity advances is, once you boil it down, one of building new tools using previous tools.</p><p>People in the bronze age weren&apos;t unable to smelt steel because they  didn&apos;t have the intelligence to &quot;figure it out&quot;, but because they didn&apos;t  have the tools to reach the desired temperature, evaluate the correct  iron &amp; carbon mixture, mine the actual iron out of the ground and  establish the trade networks required to make the whole process viable.</p><p>As tools of bronze helped us build better tools of bronze, that  helped us discover more easy to mine iron deposits, build ships and  caravans to trade the materials needed to process said iron and build  better smelters, we were suddenly able to smelt steel. Which leads us to  being able to build better and better tooling out of steel&#x2026; etc, etc.</p><p>Human civilization doesn&apos;t advance by breeding smarter and smarter humans, it advanced by building better and better tools.</p><p>The gradual knowledge that we acquire is mostly due to our tools. We  don&apos;t own our knowledge of particle physics or chemistry to a few  intelligent blokes that &quot;figured it out&quot;. We owe it to the years of  cumulative tool building that lead us to being able to build the tools  to perform the experiments that gave us insights into the very world we  inhabit.</p><p>Take away Max Planck and you might set quantum mechanics back by a  few years, but in a rather short time someone would have probably  figured out the same things he did. This is rather obvious when you look  at <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_discovery"">multiple discoveries</a>  throughout history, that is to say, people discovering the same thing,  at about the same time, without being aware of each other&#x2019;s works.</p><p>Have Max Planck be born among a tribe of hunter gatherers in the  neolithic period, and he might become a particularly clever hunter or  shaman&#x2026; but it&apos;s essentially impossible for him to have the tooling  which allowed him to make the same discoveries about nature as 20th  century Plank.</p><p>However, to some extent, the process of tool building is inhibited by  time and space. If we decided to build a more efficient battery, or a  more accurate electronic microscope, or a more accurate radio telescope,  we wouldn&apos;t be limited by our intelligence, but by the thousands of  hours required for our factories to build the better tools required to  build better factories to build even better tools required to build even  better factories in order to build even more amazing tools&#x2026; etc.</p><p>Thousands of amazing discoveries, machines and theories lie within  our grasp and one of the biggest bottlenecks is not intelligence but  resources.</p><p>Not matter how smart your interstellar spaceship design is, you will  still need rare metals, radioactive materials, hard to craft carbon  fiber and the machinery to put it all together. Which is rather  difficult, since we&apos;ve collectively decided those resources are much  better spent on portable masturbation aids, funny looking things to  stick on our bodies and giant bombs just in case we need to murder all  of humanity. </p><p>So, would a hypothetical superintelligent AGI help this process of  tools building ? Most certainly. But it will probably end up with the  same bottlenecks people that want to create amazing things face today,  other people not wanting to give up their toys and the physical reality  requiring the passage of time to shape.</p><p>Don&apos;t get me wrong, I&apos;m not necessarily blaming people for choosing  to focus on 3rd printing complexly shaped water-resistant phallus-like  structures instead of using those resources to research senolytic  nanobots. As I&apos;ve mentioned before, defining intelligence is hard, and  so is defining progress. What might seem &quot;awesome&quot; for the AGI reading  this article could be rather boring or stupid for a few other billions  of AGIs.</p><h2>In conclusion</h2><ul><li>Artificial general intelligence is something we have plenty of  here on Earth, most of it goes to waste, so I&apos;m not sure designing AGI  based on a human model would help us much.</li><li>Superhuman artificial general intelligence is not something that  we can define, since nobody has come up with a comprehensive definition  of intelligence that is self-sufficient, rather than requiring real  world trial and error.</li><li>Superhuman artificial general intelligence is not something we  can test, since we can&apos;t gather statistically valid training datasets  for complex problem and we can&apos;t afford to test via trial and error in  the real world.</li><li>Even if superhuman artificial intelligence was somehow created,  there&apos;s no way of knowing that they&apos;d be of much use to us. It may be  that intelligence is not the biggest bottleneck to our current problems,  but rather time and resources.</li></ul><p>If you think you&apos;re specific business case might require an AGI, feel  free to hire one of the 3 billion people living in South East Asia that  will gladly help you with tasks for a few dollars an hour. It&apos;s likely  to be much cheaper, <a href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/thousands-of-amazon-workers-are-listening-to-what-you-tell-alexa/articleshow/68833409.cms"">Amazon is already doing it with Alexa</a>, since it turns out to be somewhat cheaper than doing it via machine learning.</p><p>Is that to say I am &quot;against&quot; the machine learning revolution ?</p><p>No, fuck no, I&apos;d be an idiot and a hypocrite if I thought machine  learning wouldn&apos;t lead to tremendous human progress in the following  decades.</p><p>I specifically wanted to work in the area of generic machine  learning. I think it&apos;s the place to be in the next 10 or 20 years in  terms of exciting developments.</p><p>But we have to stop romanticizing or fear-mongering about the  pointless concept of a human-like intelligence being produced by  software. Instead, we should think of machine learning (or &quot;AI&quot;, if you  must really call it that) as a tool in our great arsenal of thinking  tools.</p><p>Machine learning is awesome if you apply it to the set of problems  it&apos;s good at solving and if we try to extent that set of problems by  being better and collecting and building algorithms we might be able to  accomplish some amazing feats. But the idea that an algorithm that can  mimic a human would be of particular use to us, is similarly silly to  the idea that a hammer which also serves as a teaspoon would  revolutionize the world of construction. Tools are designed to be good  at their job, not much else.</p><p>And who knows, maybe someday we&apos;ll combine some of these awesome  algorithms we&apos;ve developed, add a few extra bits, shield them inside a  realistic-looking robot body and realize that the &quot;thing&quot; we&apos;ve create  might well be a human&#x2026; then it can join us and the other billions of  humans in being mostly useless at doing anything of real value.</p>",George3d6,george3d6,George3d6,

This paper tries to model the latter by introducing the <em>assistive multi-armed bandit</em> problem.</p><p>In the standard <em>multi-armed bandit</em> problem, a player repeatedly chooses one of several &#x201C;arms&#x201D; to pull, where each arm provides reward according to some unknown distribution. Imagine getting 1000 free plays on your choice of 10 different, unknown slot machines. This is a hard problem since the player must trade off between exploration (learning about some arm) and exploitation (pulling the best arm so far). In <em>assistive multi-armed bandit</em>, a robot is given the opportunity to intercept the player every round and pull an arm of its choice. If it does not intercept, it can see the arm pulled by the player but not the reward the player receives. This formalizes the notion of an AI with only partial information trying to help a learning agent optimize their reward.</p><p>The paper does some theoretical analysis of this problem as well as an experimental set-up involving a neural network and players acting according to a variety of different policies. It makes several observations about the problem:</p><p>- A player better at learning does not necessarily lead to the player-robot team performing better-- the robot can help a suboptimal player do better in accordance with how much information the player&apos;s arm pulls convey about the reward of the arm.</p><p>- A robot is best at assisting when it has the right model for how the player is learning.</p><p>- A robot that models the player as learning generally does better than a robot that does not, even if the robot has the wrong model for the player&apos;s learning.</p><p>- The problem is very sensitive to which learning model the player uses and which learning model the robot assumes. Some player learning models can only be effectively assisted when they are correctly modeled. Some robot-assumed learning models effectively assist for a variety of actual player learning models.</p><p><strong>Asya&apos;s opinion:</strong> The standard inverse reinforcement learning assumption about humans acting optimally seems unrealistic; I think this paper provides an insightful initial step in not having that assumption and models the non-optimal version of the problem in a clean and compelling way. I think it&apos;s a noteworthy observation that this problem is very sensitive to the player&apos;s learning model, and I agree with the paper that this suggests that we should put effort into researching actual human learning strategies. I am unsure how to think about the insights here generalizing to other inverse reinforcement learning cases.</p><h1><strong>Technical AI alignment</strong></h1><h3><strong>Problems</strong></h3><p><u><a href=""https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/3/2/21/htm"">Multiparty Dynamics and Failure Modes for Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence</a></u> <em>(David Manheim)</em> (summarized by Flo): While <u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.04585"">Categorizing Variants of Goodhart&#x2019;s Law</a></u> explains failure modes that occur when a single agent&#x2019;s proxy becomes decoupled from the true goal, this paper aims to characterize failures involving multiple agents:</p><p><strong>Accidental steering</strong> happens when the combined actions of multiple agents facilitate single-agent failures. For example, catching more fish now is usually positively correlated with a fisherman&apos;s long term goals, but this relationship inverts once there are lots of fishermen optimizing for short term gains and the fish population collapses.</p><p><strong>Coordination Failure</strong> occurs when agents with mutually compatible goals fail to coordinate. For example, due to incomplete models of other agent&apos;s goals and capabilities, two agents sharing a goal might compete for a resource even though one of them is strictly better at converting the resource into progress towards their goal.</p><p><strong>Adversarial optimization</strong> is when an agent <strong>O</strong> steers the world into states where <strong>V</strong>&apos;s proxy goal is positively correlated with <strong>O</strong>&apos;s goal. For example, one could exploit investors who use short term volatility as a proxy for risk by selling them instruments that are not very volatile but still risky.</p><p><strong>Input Spoofing</strong> is the act of one agent manipulating another learning agent&apos;s model, either by manufacturing false evidence or by filtering the received evidence systematically, as arguably happened with <u><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tay_(bot)"">Microsoft&#x2019;s Tay</a></u>.</p><p>Finally, <strong>Goal co-option</strong> happens when agent <strong>O</strong> has (partial) control over the hardware agent <strong>V</strong> runs or relies on. This way, <strong>O</strong> can either modify the reward signal <strong>V</strong> receives to change what <strong>V</strong> optimizes for, or it can directly change <strong>V</strong>&apos;s outputs.</p><p>The difficulties in precisely modelling other sophisticated agents and other concerns related to embedded agency make it hard to completely avoid these failure modes with current methods. Slowing down the deployment of AI systems and focussing on the mitigation of the discussed failure modes might prevent limited near term catastrophes, which in turn might cause a slowdown of further deployment and prioritization of safety.</p><p><strong>Flo&apos;s opinion:</strong> I like that this paper subdivides failure modes that can happen in multiparty optimization into several clear categories and provides various models and examples for each of them. I am unsure about the conclusion: on one hand, slowing down deployment to improve the safety of contemporary systems seems very sensible. On the other hand, it seems like there would be some failures of limited scope that are hard to reproduce &quot;in the lab&quot;. Widely deployed AI systems might provide us with valuable empirical data about these failures and improve our understanding of the failure modes in general. I guess ideally there would be differential deployment with rapid deployment in noncritical areas like managing local parking lots, but very slow deployment for critical infrastructure.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> I&apos;m particularly interested in an analysis of how these kinds of failures affect existential risk. I&apos;m not sure if David believes they are relevant for x-risk, but even if so the arguments aren&apos;t presented in this paper.</p><h3><strong>Mesa optimization</strong></h3><p><u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/9Dy5YRaoCxH9zuJqa/relaxed-adversarial-training-for-inner-alignment"">Relaxed adversarial training for inner alignment</a></u> <em>(Evan Hubinger)</em> (summarized by Matthew): Previously, Paul Christiano <u><a href=""https://ai-alignment.com/training-robust-corrigibility-ce0e0a3b9b4d"">proposed</a></u> creating an adversary to search for inputs that would make a powerful model behave &quot;unacceptably&quot; and then penalizing the model accordingly. To make the adversary&apos;s job easier, Paul relaxed the problem so that it only needed to find a pseudo-input, which can be thought of as predicate that constrains possible inputs. This post expands on Paul&apos;s proposal by first defining a formal unacceptability penalty and then analyzing a number of scenarios in light of this framework. The penalty relies on the idea of an amplified model inspecting the unamplified version of itself. For this procedure to work, amplified overseers must be able to correctly deduce whether potential inputs will yield unacceptable behavior in their unamplified selves, which seems plausible since it should know everything the unamplified version does. The post concludes by arguing that progress in model transparency is key to these acceptability guarantees. In particular, Evan emphasizes the need to decompose models into the parts involved in their internal optimization processes, such as their world models, optimization procedures, and objectives.</p><p><strong>Matthew&apos;s opinion:</strong> I agree that transparency is an important condition for the adversary, since it would be hard to search for catastrophe-inducing inputs without details of how the model operated. I&apos;m less certain that this particular decomposition of machine learning models is necessary. More generally, I am excited to see how adversarial training can help with <u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/pL56xPoniLvtMDQ4J/the-inner-alignment-problem"">inner alignment</a></u>.</p><h3><strong>Learning human intent</strong></h3><p><u><a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.13392"">Learning from Observations Using a Single Video Demonstration and Human Feedback</a></u> <em>(Sunil Gandhi et al)</em> (summarized by Zach): Designing rewards can be a long and consuming process, even for experts. One common method to circumvent this problem is through demonstration. However, it might be difficult to record demonstrations in a standard representation, such as joint positions. <strong>In this paper, the authors propose using human feedback to circumvent the discrepancy between how demonstrations are recorded (video) and the desired standard representation (joint positions).</strong> First, humans provide similarity evaluations of short clips of an expert demonstration to the agent&apos;s attempt and a similarity function is learned by the agent. Second, this similarity function is used to help train a policy that can imitate the expert. Both functions are learned jointly. The algorithm can learn to make a Hopper agent back-flip both from a Hopper demonstration of a back-flip, and from a YouTube video of a human backflipping. Ultimately, the authors show that their method improves over another method that uses human feedback without direct comparison to desired behavior.</p><p><strong>Zach&apos;s opinion:</strong> This paper seems like a natural extension of prior work. The imitation learning problem from observation is well-known and difficult. Introducing human feedback with a structured state space definitely seems like a viable way to get around a lot of the known difficulties with other methods such as a GAIL.</p><h3><strong>Handling groups of agents</strong></h3><p><u><a href=""https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2019/10/21/coordination/"">Collaborating with Humans Requires Understanding Them</a></u> <em>(Micah Carroll et al)</em> (summarized by Rohin): <em>Note: I am second author on this paper.</em> Self-play agents (like those used to play <u><a href=""https://blog.openai.com/openai-five/"">Dota</a></u> (<u><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/8234356e4b7f/alignment-newsletter-13"">AN #13</a></u>) and <u><a href=""https://deepmind.com/blog/alphastar-mastering-real-time-strategy-game-starcraft-ii/"">Starcraft</a></u> (<u><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/768a8130013f/alignment-newsletter-43"">AN #43</a></u>)) are very good at coordinating with <em>themselves</em>, but not with other agents. They &quot;expect&quot; their partners to be similar to them; they are unable to predict what human partners would do. In competitive games, this is fine: if the human deviates from optimal play, even if you don&apos;t predict it you will still beat them. (Another way of saying this: the minimax theorem guarantees a minimum reward <em>regardless</em> of the opponent.) However, in cooperative settings, things are not so nice: a failure to anticipate your partner&apos;s plan can lead to arbitrarily bad outcomes. We demonstrate this with a simple environment that requires strong coordination based on the popular game Overcooked. We show that agents specifically trained to play alongside humans perform much better than self-play or population-based training when paired with humans, both in simulation and with a real user study.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> I wrote a short <u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/dBMC63hjkc5wPqTC7/human-ai-collaboration"">blog post</a></u> talking about the implications of the work. Briefly, there are three potential impacts. First, it seems generically useful to understand how to coordinate with an unknown agent. Second, it is specifically useful for scaling up <u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03137"">assistance games</a></u> (<u><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/59ddebcb3b9a/an-69-stuart-russells-new-book-on-why-we-need-to-replace-the-standard-model-of-ai"">AN #69</a></u>), which are intractable to solve optimally. Finally, it can lead to more ML researchers focusing on solving problems with real humans, which may lead to us finding and solving other problems that will need to be solved in order to build aligned AI systems.</p><p><strong>Read more:</strong> <u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.05789"">Paper: On the Utility of Learning about Humans for Human-AI Coordination</a></u></p><p><u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.10071"">Learning Existing Social Conventions via Observationally Augmented Self-Play</a></u> <em>(Adam Lerer and Alexander Peysakhovich)</em> (summarized by Rohin): This paper starts from the same key insight about self-play not working when it needs to generalize to out-of-distribution agents, but then does something different. They assume that the test-time agents are playing an <strong>equilibrium policy</strong>, that is, each agent plays a best response policy assuming all the other policies are fixed. They train their agent using a combination of imitation learning and self-play: the self-play gets them to learn an equilibrium behavior, while the imitation learning pushes them towards the equilibrium that the test-time agents use. They outperform both vanilla self-play and vanilla imitation learning.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> Humans don&apos;t play equilibrium policies, since they are often suboptimal. For example, in Overcooked, any equilibrium policy will zip around the layout, rarely waiting, which humans are not capable of doing. However, when you have a very limited dataset of human behavior, the bias provided by the assumption of an equilibrium policy probably does help the agent generalize better than a vanilla imitation learning model, and so this technique might do better when there is not much data.</p><h3><strong>Adversarial examples</strong></h3><p><u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10615"">Adversarial Policies: Attacking Deep Reinforcement Learning</a></u> <em>(Adam Gleave et al)</em> (summarized by Sudhanshu): This work demonstrates the existence of <em>adversarial policies</em> of behaviour in high-dimensional, two-player zero-sum games. Specifically, they show that adversarially-trained agents (&quot;Adv&quot;), who can only affect a victim&apos;s observations of their (Adv&apos;s) states, can act in ways that confuse the victim into behaving suboptimally.</p><p>An adversarial policy is trained by reinforcement learning in a single-player paradigm where the victim is a black-box fixed policy that was previously trained via self-play to be robust to adversarial attacks. As a result, the adversarial policies learn to push the observations of the victim outside the training distribution, causing the victim to behave poorly. The adversarial policies do not actually behave intelligently, such as blocking or tackling the victim, but instead do unusual things like spasming in a manner that appears random to humans, curling into a ball or kneeling.</p><p>Further experiments showed that if the victim&apos;s observations of the adversary were removed, then the adversary was unable to learn such an adversarial policy. In addition, the victim&apos;s network activations were very different when playing against an adversarial policy relative to playing against a random or lifeless opponent. By comparing two similar games where the key difference was the number of adversary dimensions being observed, they showed that such policies were easier to learn in higher-dimensional games.</p><p><strong>Sudhanshu&apos;s opinion:</strong> This work points to an important question about optimisation in high dimension continuous spaces: without guarantees on achieving solution optimality, how do we design performant systems that are robust to (irrelevant) off-distribution observations? By generating demonstrations that current methods are insufficient, it can inspire future work across areas like active learning, continual learning, fall-back policies, and exploration.</p><p>I had a tiny nit-pick: while the discussion is excellent, the paper doesn&apos;t cover whether this phenomenon has been observed before with discrete observation/action spaces, and why/why not, which I feel would be an important aspect to draw out. In a finite environment, the victim policy might have actually covered every possible situation, and thus be robust to such attacks; for continuous spaces, it is not clear to me whether we can <em>always</em> find an adversarial attack.</p><p>In separate correspondence, author Adam Gleave notes that he considers these to be relatively low-dimensional -- even MNIST has way more dimensions -- so when comparing to regular adversarial examples work, it seems like multi-agent RL is harder to make robust than supervised learning.</p><p><strong>Read more:</strong> <u><a href=""https://adversarialpolicies.github.io/"">Adversarial Policies website</a></u></p><h1><strong>Other progress in AI</strong></h1><h3><strong>Reinforcement learning</strong></h3><p><u><a href=""https://openai.com/blog/solving-rubiks-cube/"">Solving Rubik&#x2019;s Cube with a Robot Hand</a></u> <em>(OpenAI)</em> (summarized by Asya): Historically, researchers have had limited success making general purpose robot hands. Now, OpenAI has successfully trained a pair of neural networks to solve a Rubik&apos;s cube with a human-like robot hand (the learned portion of the problem is manipulating the hand -- solving the Rubik&apos;s cube is specified via a classical algorithm). The hand is able to solve the Rubik&apos;s cube even under a variety of perturbations, including having some of its fingers tied together, or having its view of the cube partially occluded. The primary innovation presented is a new method called <em>Automatic Domain Randomization</em> (ADR). ADR automatically generates progressively more difficult environments to train on in simulation that are diverse enough to capture the physics of the real world. ADR performs better than existing domain randomization methods, which require manually specifying randomization ranges. The post speculates that ADR is actually leading to <em>emergent meta-learning</em>, where the network learns a learning algorithm that allows itself to rapidly adapt its behavior to its environment.</p><p><strong>Asya&apos;s opinion:</strong> My impression is that this is a very impressive robotics result, largely because the problem of transferring training in simulation to real life (&quot;sim2real&quot;) is extremly difficult. I also think it&apos;s quite novel if as the authors hypothesize, the system is exhibiting emergent meta-learning. It&apos;s worth noting that the hand is still not quite at human-level -- in the hardest configurations, it only succeeds 20% of the time, and for most experiments, the hand gets some of the state of the cube via Bluetooth sensors inside the cube, not just via vision.</p><p><strong>Read more:</strong> <u><a href=""https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/10/15/20910007/robot-rubiks-cube-one-handed"">Vox: Watch this robot solve a Rubik&#x2019;s Cube one-handed</a></u></p><h1><strong>News</strong></h1><p><u><a href=""https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/scholarships/"">FHI DPhil Scholarships</a></u> (summarized by Rohin): The Future of Humanity Institute will be awarding up to two DPhil scholarships for the 2020/21 academic year, open to students beginning a DPhil at the University of Oxford whose research aims to answer crucial questions for improving the long-term prospects of humanity.

When you click a link, by default your browser sends a request like:



<pre>
   GET /your-page HTTP/1.1
   Host: your-site
   Referer: https://other-site/with-url
   [other headers]
</pre>

It's telling the server what page it wants
(

https://your-site/your-page) and it includes a


Referer saying that you came from


https://other-site/with-url.



</p><p>

But why Referer and not Referrer?  Let's look back.
The original version of HTTP had a much simpler request format:

</p>

<pre>
   GET /your-page
</pre>

No 

Host:, no 

Referer: no headers at all.

This
initial version, implemented in the 

<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WorldWideWeb"">WWW</a> browser, became known as
HTTP/0.9.  There's a 

<a href=""http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Protocols/HTTP.html"">design
doc</a> and an 

<a href=""https://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/AsImplemented.html"">as-implemented
doc</a>, both with no mention of headers.



<p>

Right away there were many things people wanted from HTTP that
HTTP/0.9 didn't support, and there were lots of ideas for the next
version.  Not surprisingly some of these initial ideas didn't look
much like modern HTTP.  <a href=""http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Protocols/HTTP/HTTP2.html"">Updates

<a href=""http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/HTRQ.html"">HyperText

<p>

While you can see what became the <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/From"">From</a>,
<a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Authorization"">Authorization</a>,

and <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/User-Agent"">User-Agent</a>
headers, this was clearly not in its final form.  And there's no
Referer.

</p>

<p>

A bit later in 1992, however, we get to what's going to become
HTTP/1.0: <a href=""https://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/HTTP2.html"">Basic
HTTP as defined in 1992</a>.  It does define request headers (<a href=""https://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/HTRQ_Headers.html"">spec</a>)
including Referer:

</p>

<p>

</p>

<blockquote>
This optional header field allows the client to specify, for the
server's benefit, the address (URI) of the document (or element
within the document) from which the URI in the request was obtained.
<p>
This allows a server to generate lists of back-links to documents, for
interest, logging, etc. It allows bad links to be traced for
maintenance.
</p>
</blockquote>



<p>

By the time anyone noticed the misspelling, it seems this new version
of HTTP was widely enough distributed that no one (unsurprisingly) was
interested in taking on a large coordination project to fix a minor
misspelling.  I see Phillip Hallam-Baker <a href=""https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-http-wg-old/1995JanApr/0109.html"">writing
in March 1995</a>:

</p>

<p>

</p>

<pre>
&gt;&gt; Has anyone else noticed that the HTTP
&gt;&gt; header ""Referer:"" is spelled wrong?
&gt;
&gt;That's okay, neither one (referer or referrer)
&gt;is understood by ""spell"" anyway.  I say we
&gt;should just blame it on France.  ;-)

I also managed to mispell alt.games.mornington.cresent
when I created it. I think this one is down to Tim.
I sent him a note with the suggestion but I don't
think I gave a name for the field.
</pre>



<p>

<a href=""https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1945"">RFC 1945</a> (HTTP/1.0,
May 1996) defines Referer, and <a href=""https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2068"">RFC 2068</a> (HTTP/1.1,
January 1997) marks it with [sic].  Presumably so people
would stop writing to them to say ""you spelled it wrong"".

</p>

<p>

2000</a> Hallam-Baker write:

Here he says the misspelling was his, while in 1995 he points at
Berners-Lee.  Wikipedia 

<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_referer#Etymology"">goes with
the 2000 message</a>:



<blockquote>
The misspelling of referrer originated in the original proposal by
computer scientist Phillip Hallam-Baker to incorporate the field into
the HTTP specification.
</blockquote>

It seems likely to me that Hallam-Baker's memory of 1992 in 1995,
however, was more accurate than his of 1992 in 2000.  So this sounds
like another thing to credit to Berners-Lee.



<p>

While the misspelling doesn't really matter, it's a fun excuse for
looking back through the documents of the early web.  They were
written a long time ago, in computer times, and even though they use
long-deprecated tags like <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/xmp"">&lt;XMP&gt;</a>
they still render reasonably in modern browsers.

But if I already knew the truth status of all of its claims, I wouldn’t need to read it. <a href=""https://acesounderglass.com/tag/epistemicspotcheck/"">Epistemic Spot Checks</a> are an attempt to square that circle by sampling a book’s claims and determining their truth value, with the assumption that the sample is representative of the whole.</p>
<p>Some claims are easier to check than others. On one end are simple facts, e.g., “Emperor Valerian spent his final years as a Persian prisoner”. This was easy and quick to verify: googling “emperor valerian” was quite sufficient. “Roman ship sizes weren’t exceeded until the 15th century” looks similar, but it wasn’t. If you google the claim itself, it will look confirmed (evidence: me and 3 other people in the forecasting tournament did this). At the last second while researching this, I decided to check the size of Chinese ships, which surpassed Roman ships sooner than Europe did, by about a century.</p>
<p>On first blush this looks like a success story, but it’s not. I was only able to catch the mistake because I had a bunch of background knowledge about the state of the world. If I didn’t already know mid-millenium China was better than Europe at almost everything (and I remember a time when I didn’t), I could easily have drawn the wrong conclusion about that claim. And following a procedure that would catch issues like this every time would take much more time than ESCs currently get.</p>
<p>Then there’s terminally vague questions, like “Did early modern Europe have more emphasis on rationality and less superstition than other parts of the world?” (As claimed by The Unbound Prometheus). It would be optimistic to say that question requires several books to answer, but even if that were true, each of them would need at least an ESC themselves to see if they’re trustworthy, which might involve checking other claims requiring several books to verify… pretty soon it’s a master’s thesis.</p>
<p>But I can’t get a master’s degree in everything interesting or relevant to my life. And that brings up another point: credentialism. A lot of ESC revolves around “Have people who have officially been Deemed Credible sanctioned this fact?” rather than “Have I seen evidence that I, personally, judge to be compelling?” </p>
<p><i><a href=""https://acesounderglass.com/2019/08/22/epistemic-spot-check-the-fate-of-rome-kyle-harper/"">The Fate of Rome</a> </i>(Kyle Harper) and <i><a href=""https://acesounderglass.com/2019/10/16/epistemic-spot-checks-the-fall-of-rome/"">The Fall of Rome</a></i> (Bryan Ward-Perkins) are both about the collapse of the western Roman empire. They both did almost flawlessly on their respective epistemic spot checks. And yet, they attribute the fall of Rome to very different causes, and devote almost no time to the others’ explanation. If you drew a venn diagram of the data they discuss, the circles would be almost but not quite entirely distinct. The word “plague” appears 651 times in <i>Fate</i> and 6 times in <i>Fall</i>, who introduces the topic mostly to dismiss the idea that it was causally related to the fall- which is how <i>Fate</i> treats all those border adjustments happening from 300 AD on. <i>Fate</i> is very into discussing climate, but <i>Fall</i> uses that space to talk about pottery.</p>
<p>This is why I called the process epistemic spot checking, not truth-checking. Determining if a book is true requires not only determining if each individual claim is true, but what other explanations exist and what has been left out. Depending on the specifics, ESC as I do them now are perhaps half the work of reading the subsection of the book I verify. Really thoroughly checking <a href=""https://acesounderglass.com/2019/06/21/epistemic-spot-check-the-role-of-deliberate-practice-in-the-acquisition-of-expert-performance/"">a single paragraph</a> in a published paper took me 10-20 hours. And even if I succeed at the ESC, all I have is a thumbs up/thumbs down on the book.</p>
<p>Around the same time I was doing ESCs on <i>The Fall of Rome </i>and <i>The Fate of Rome</i> (the ESCs were published far apart to get maximum publicity for the Amplification experiment, but I read and performed the ESCs very close together), I was commissioned to do a shallow review on the question of “<a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ESpw8p5kJy9zo4nNC/shallow-review-of-consistency-in-statement-evaluation"">How to get consistency in predictions or evaluations of questions?</a>” I got excellent feedback from the person who commissioned it, but I felt like it said a lot more about the state of a field of literature than the state of the world, because I had to take authors’ words for their findings. It had all the problems ESCs were designed to prevent.</p>
<p>I’m in the early stages of trying to form something better: something that incorporates the depth of epistemic spot checks with the breadth of field reviews. It’s designed to bootstrap from knowing nothing in a field to being grounded and informed and having a firm base on which to evaluate new information. This is hard and I expect it to take a while. </p>

<p>To set the framing of this post: We want good outcomes from AI. To get this, we probably want to figure out the human user's or users' ""actual preferences"" at some point. There are several options for this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Directly solve meta-ethics</strong>. We figure out whether there are normative facts about what we should value, and use this solution to clarify what ""actual preferences"" means and to find the human's or humans' ""actual preferences"".</li>
<li><strong>Solve <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/EByDsY9S3EDhhfFzC/some-thoughts-on-metaphilosophy"">meta-philosophy</a></strong>. This is like solving meta-ethics, but there is an extra level of meta: we figure out what philosophy is or what human brains are doing when they make philosophical progress, then use this understanding to solve meta-ethics. Then we proceed as in the ""directly solve meta-ethics"" approach.</li>
<li><strong>Deliberate for a long time</strong>. We actually get a human or group of humans to think for a long time under idealized conditions, or approximate the output of this process somehow. This might reduce to one of the above approaches (if the humans come to believe that solving meta-ethics/meta-philosophy is the best way to find their ""actual preferences"") or it might not.</li>
</ul>
<p>The third option is the focus of this post. The first two are also very worthy of consideration—they just aren't the focus here. Also the list isn't meant to be comprehensive; I would be interested to hear any other approaches.</p>
<p>In terms of Paul's recent <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/zQgqAc9nQETjFjawJ/ai-alignment-landscape"">AI alignment landscape tree</a>, I think this discussion fits under the ""Learn from teacher"" node, but I'm not sure.</p>
<p>Terminological note: In this post, I use ""deliberation"" and ""reflection"" interchangeably. I think this is standard, but I'm not sure. If anyone uses these terms differently, I would like to know how they distinguish between them.</p>
<h1>Approaches to deliberation that have been suggested so far</h1>
<p>In this section, I list some concrete-ish approaches to deliberation that have been considered so far. I say ""concrete-ish"" rather than ""concrete"" because each of these approaches seems underdetermined in many ways, e.g. for ""humans sitting down"", it's not clear if we split the humans up in some way, which humans we use, how much time we allow, what kind of ""voting""/parliamentary system we use, and so on. Later on in this post I will talk about properties for deliberation, so the ""concrete-ish"" approaches here are concrete in two senses: (a) they have some of these properties filled in (e.g. ""humans sitting down"" says the computation happens primarily inside human brains); and (b) within a single property, they might specify a specific mechanism (e.g. saying ""use counterfactual oracles somehow"" is more concrete than saying ""use an approach where the computation doesn't happen inside human brains"").</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Humans sitting down</strong>. A human or group of humans sitting down and thinking for a long time (a.k.a. Long Reflection/Great Deliberation).</li>
<li><strong>Uploads sitting down</strong>. The above, but with whole brain emulations (uploads) instead. This would speed up the reflection in calendar time. There are probably other benefits and <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/HW5Q9cW9sgk4yCffd/hacking-the-cev-for-fun-and-profit"">drawbacks</a> as well.</li>
<li><strong>Counterfactual oracles</strong>. Certain uses of counterfactual oracles allow humans to speed up reflection. For example, if we ask a counterfactual oracle to predict what we will say in a week, then we can get the answer now instead of waiting a week to find out what we would have said. See <a href=""https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/cSzaxcmeYW6z7cgtc/contest-usd1-000-for-good-questions-to-ask-to-an-oracle-ai/comment/Q5J8G5tBPujZdixvt"">these</a> <a href=""https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/cSzaxcmeYW6z7cgtc/contest-usd1-000-for-good-questions-to-ask-to-an-oracle-ai/comment/SZmMGEBM3Cvf6DFTL"">two</a> comments for a more detailed proposal.</li>
<li><strong>Imitation-based IDA</strong> (iterated distillation and amplification). The human can break apart the question of ""What are my actual preferences?"" into sub-queries and use AI assistants to help answer the question. Alternatively, the human can ask more ""concrete"" questions like ""How do I solve this math problem?"" or specify more concrete tasks like ""Help me schedule an appointment"", where the output of deliberation is implicit in how the AI system behaves.</li>
<li><strong>RL-based IDA</strong>. This is like imitation-based IDA, but instead of distilling the overseer via imitation, we use reinforcement learning.</li>
<li><strong>Debate</strong>. This is probably a dumb idea, but we can imagine getting the two AIs in Debate to argue for what the human should think about their values. Instead of exploring the whole tree of arguments and counter-arguments, the human can just process a single path through the tree, which will speed up the reflection.</li>
<li><strong>CEV</strong> (coherent extrapolated volition), or more specifically what Eliezer Yudkowsky calls ""initial dynamic"" in the <a href=""https://intelligence.org/files/CEV.pdf"">CEV paper</a>. An AI tries to figure out what a group of humans would think about their values if they knew more, thought faster, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Ambitious value learning</strong>. Somehow use lots of data and compute to learn the human utility function.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Properties of deliberation</h1>
<p>With the examples above in hand, I want to step back and abstract out some properties/axes/dimensions they have.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Human vs non-human computation</strong>. Does the computation happen primarily inside human brains?</li>
<li><strong>Human-like vs non-human-like cognition</strong>. Does the cognition resemble human thought? If the computation happens outside human brains, we can try to mimic the low-level steps in the reasoning of the deliberation (i.e. simulating human thought), or we can just try to predict the outward result without going through the same internal mechanics (non-simulated). There are intermediate cases where we predict-without-simulating over short time periods (like one hour) but then simulate as we glue together these short-term reflections. One can also think of human-like vs non-human-like cognition as whether the <em>process</em> (rather than <em>output</em>; see below) of deliberation is explicit (human-like) vs implicit (non-human-like).
<ul>
<li>In the non-simulated case, there is the further question of whether any consequentialist reasoning takes place (it might be impossible to predict a long-term reflection without any consequentialist reasoning, so this might only apply to short-term reflections). Further discussion: Q5 in the CEV paper, <a href=""https://arbital.com/p/Vingean_reflection/"">Vingean reflection</a>, <a href=""https://arbital.com/p/reflective_degree_of_freedom/#subpage-2h4"">this comment</a> by Eliezer and Paul's reply to it, <a href=""https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/5bd75cc58225bf06703750d7/notes-from-a-conversation-on-act-based-and-goal-directed-systems"">this post</a> and the resulting discussion.</li>
<li>When I was originally thinking about this, I conflated ""Does the computation happen primarily inside human brains?"" and ""Does the cognition resemble human thought?"" but these two can vary independently. For instance, whole brain emulation does the computation outside of human brains even though the cognition resembles human thought, and an implementation of HCH could hypothetically be done involving just humans but its cognition would not resemble human thought.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Implicit vs explicit output</strong>. Is the output of the deliberation explicitly represented, or is it just implicit in how the system behaves? From the <a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.08575.pdf"">IDA paper</a>: ""The human must be involved in this process because there is no external objective to guide learning—the objective is implicit in the way that the human coordinates the copies of <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""X""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.024em;"">X</span></span></span></span><style>.mjx-chtml {display: inline-block; line-height: 0; text-indent: 0; text-align: left; text-transform: none; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 100%; font-size-adjust: none; letter-spacing: normal; word-wrap: normal; word-spacing: normal; white-space: nowrap; float: none; direction: ltr; max-width: none; max-height: none; min-width: 0; min-height: 0; border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 1px 0}

</style></span></span>. For example, we have no external measure of what constitutes a 'good' answer to a question, this notion is only implicit in how a human decides to combine the answers to subquestions (which usually involves both facts and value judgments).""
<ul>
<li>I also initially conflated implicit vs explicit <em>process</em> and implicit vs explicit <em>output</em>. Again, these can vary independently: RL-based IDA would have an explicit representation of the reward function but the deliberation would not resemble human thought (explicit output, implicit process), and we can imagine some humans who end up refusing to state what they value even after reflection, saying something like ""I'll just do whatever I feel like doing in the moment"" (implicit output, explicit process).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Human intermediate integration</strong>. Some kinds of approaches (like counterfactual oracles and Debate) seem to speed up the deliberation by ""offloading"" parts of the work to AIs and having the humans integrate the intermediate results.</li>
<li><strong>Human understandability of output</strong>. The output of deliberation could be simple enough that a human could understand it and integrate it into their worldviews, or it could be so complicated that this is not possible. It seems like there is a choice as to whether to allow non-understandable outputs. This was called ""understandability"" in <a href=""https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/nRAMpjnb6Z4Qv3imF/the-strategy-stealing-assumption/comment/yttsoDd4EyLZeEwdw"">this comment</a>. Whereas human vs non-human computation is about whether the <em>process</em> of deliberation takes place in the human brain, and human-like vs non-human-like cognition is about whether the <em>process</em> is humanly understandable, human understandability is about whether the <em>output</em> eventually makes its way into the human brain. See the table below for a summary.</li>
<li><strong>Speed</strong>. In AI takeoff scenarios where a bunch of different AIs are competing with each other, the deliberation process must produce some answer quickly or produce successive answers as time goes on (in order to figure out which resources are worth acquiring). On the other hand, in takeoff scenarios where the first successful project achieves a decisive strategic advantage, the deliberation can take its time.</li>
<li><strong>Number of rounds</strong> (<strong>satisficing vs maximizing</strong>). The CEV paper talks about CEV as a way to ""apply emergency first aid to human civilization, but not do humanity’s work on our behalf, or decide our futures for us"" (p. 36). This seems to imply that in the ""CEV story"", humanity itself (or at least some subset of humans) will do even more reflection after CEV. To use the terminology from the CEV paper, the first round is to satisfice, and the second round is to maximize.<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-bL3rp2FjFrfufpsAP-1"" id=""fnref-bL3rp2FjFrfufpsAP-1"">[1]</a></sup> Paul also seems to envision the AI learning human values in two rounds: the first round to gain a minimal understanding for the purpose of strategy-stealing, and the second round to gain a more nuanced understanding to implement our ""actual preferences"".<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-bL3rp2FjFrfufpsAP-2"" id=""fnref-bL3rp2FjFrfufpsAP-2"">[2]</a></sup></li>
<li><strong>Individual vs collective reflection</strong>. The CEV paper argues for extrapolating the collective volition of all currently-existing humans, and says things like ""You can go from a collective dynamic to an individual dynamic, but not the other way around; it’s a one-way hatch"" (p. 23). As far as I know, other people haven't really <em>argued</em> one way or the other (in some places I've seen people restricting discussion to a single human for sake of simplicity).</li>
<li><strong>Peeking at the output</strong>. In the CEV paper and Arbital page, Eliezer talks about giving a single human or group of humans the ability to peek at the output of the reflection and allow them to ""veto"" the output of the reflection. See ""Moral hazard vs. debugging"" on the <a href=""https://arbital.com/p/cev/"">Arbital CEV page</a> and also discussions of Last Judge in the CEV paper.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm not sure that these dimensions cleanly separate or how important they are. There are also probably many other dimensions that I'm missing.</p>
<p>Since I had trouble distinguishing between some of the above properties, I made the following table:</p>

<p>The following table summarizes my understanding of where each of the concrete-ish approaches stands on a subset of the above properties. I've restricted the comparison to a subset of the properties because many approaches leave certain questions unanswered and also because if I add too many columns the table will become difficult to read.</p>
<p>In addition to the approaches listed above, I've included HCH since I think it's an interesting theoretical case to look at.</p>

<p>* We could imagine asking a question like ""What are my actual preferences?"" to get an explicit answer, or just ask AI assistants to do something (in which case the output of deliberation is not explicit).</p>
<p>† Paul <a href=""https://ai-alignment.com/an-unaligned-benchmark-b49ad992940b"">says</a> ""Rather than learning a reward function from human data, we also train it by amplification (acting on the same representations used by the generative model). Again, we can distill the reward function into a neural network that acts on sequences of observations, but now instead of learning to predict human judgments it’s predicting a very large implicit deliberation."" The ""implicit"" in this quote seems to refer to the process (rather than output) of deliberation. See also the paragraph starting with ""To summarize my own understanding"" in <a href=""https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/nRAMpjnb6Z4Qv3imF/the-strategy-stealing-assumption/comment/37c6aba73PnWx6uJT"">this comment</a> (which I think is talking about RL-based IDA), which suggests that maybe we should distinguish between ""understandable in theory if we had the time"" vs ""understandable within the time constraints we have"" (in the table I went with the latter). There is also the question of whether a reward function is ""explicit enough"" as a representation of values.</p>
<p>‡ Q5 (p. 32) in the <a href=""https://intelligence.org/files/CEV.pdf"">CEV paper</a> clarifies that the computation to find CEV wouldn't be sentient, but I'm not sure if the paper says whether the cognition will resemble human thought.</p>
<h1>Takeaways</h1>
<ul>
<li>We can imagine a graph where the horizontal axis is ""quality of deliberation"" and the vertical axis is ""quality of outcome (overall value of the future)"". If your intuition says that the overall value of the future is sensitive to the quality of deliberation, it seems good to pay attention to how different ""<a href=""https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/bnY3L48TtDrKTzGRb/ai-safety-success-stories"">success stories</a>"" incorporate deliberation, and to understand the quality of deliberation for each approach. It might turn out that there is a certain threshold above which outcomes are ""good enough"" and that all the concrete approaches pass this threshold (the threshold could exist on either axis—we might stop caring about how good the outcomes are above a certain point, or all approaches to deliberation above a certain point produce basically the same outcome); in that case, understanding deliberation might not be so interesting. However, if there are no such thresholds (so that better deliberation continually leads to better outcomes), or if some of the approaches do not pass the threshold, then it seems worth being picky about how deliberation is implemented (potentially rejecting certain success stories for lack of satisfactory deliberation).</li>
<li>Thinking about deliberation is tricky because it requires mentally keeping track of the strategic background/assumptions for each ""success story"", e.g. talking about speed of deliberation only makes sense in a slow takeoff scenario, and peeking at the output only makes sense under types of deliberation where the humans aren't doing the work. See my <a href=""https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/bnY3L48TtDrKTzGRb/ai-safety-success-stories/comment/eJJhfqzb3roRFdhJm"">related comment</a> about a similar issue with success stories. It's also tricky because there turns out to be a bunch of subtle distinctions that I didn't realize existed.</li>
<li>One of my original motivations for thinking about deliberation was to try to understand what kind of deliberation Paul has in mind for IDA. Having gone through the above analysis, I feel like I understand each approach (e.g. RL-based IDA, counterfactual oracles) better but I'm not sure I understand Paul's overall vision any better. I think my main confusion is that Paul talks about many different ways deliberation could work (e.g. RL-based IDA and <a href=""https://ai-alignment.com/counterfactual-human-in-the-loop-a7822e36f399"">human-in-the-counterfactual-loop</a> seem pretty different), and it's not clear what approach he thinks is most plausible.</li>

dBMC63hjkc5wPqTC7,Human-AI Collaboration,human-ai-collaboration,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/dBMC63hjkc5wPqTC7/human-ai-collaboration,2019-10-22T06:32:20.910Z,42,14,7,False,False,https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2019/10/21/coordination/,"<p>We&#x2019;ve just released our paper on human-AI collaboration. The paper makes a straightforward-to-me point that self-play training is not going to work as well with humans in collaborative settings as in competitive settings. Basically, humans cause a distributional shift for the self-play agent. However, in the competitive case, the self-play agent should move towards the minimax policy, which has the nice property of guaranteeing a certain level of reward regardless of the opponent. The collaborative case has no such guarantee, and the distribution shift can tank the team performance. We demonstrated this empirically on a simplified version of the couch coop game Overcooked (which is amazing, I&#x2019;ve played through both Overcooked games with friends).</p><p>As with a <u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/7f6DNZhracD7RvxMr/learning-preferences-by-looking-at-the-world"">previous post</a></u>, the rest of this post assumes that you&#x2019;ve already read the <u><a href=""https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2019/10/21/coordination/"">blog post</a></u>. I&#x2019;ll speculate about how the general area of human-AI collaboration is relevant for AI alignment. Think of these as rationalizations of the research after the fact.</p><h3>It&#x2019;s necessary for assistance games</h3><p>Assistance games (formerly called <u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03137"">CIRL games</a></u>) involve a human and an agent working together to optimize a shared objective that only the human knows. I <u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/nd692YfFGfZDh9Mwz/an-69-stuart-russell-s-new-book-on-why-we-need-to-replace"">think</a></u> the general framework makes a lot of sense. Unfortunately, assistance games are extremely intractable to solve. If you try to scale up assistance games as a whole, the <u><a href=""https://interactive-learning.github.io/"">resulting environment</a></u> is not very strategically complex, because it&#x2019;s hard to do preference learning and coordination simultaneously with deep RL. This suggests trying to make progress on subproblems within assistance games.</p><p>Usually, when people talk about making progress on &#x201C;the CIRL agenda&#x201D;, they are talking about the preference learning aspect of an assistance game. We typically simplify to a single-agent setting and do preference learning, as in learning from <u><a href=""https://deepmind.com/blog/learning-through-human-feedback/"">comparisons</a></u> or <u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.11248"">demonstrations</a></u>. However, a useful agent will also need to properly coordinate with the human in order to be efficient. This suggests work on human-AI collaboration. We can work on this problem independently of preference learning simply by assuming that the agent knows the true reward function. This is exactly the setting that we study.</p><p>In general, I expect that if one hopes to take an assistance-game-like approach to AI alignment, work on human-AI collaboration will be necessary. The main uncertainty is whether assistance games are the right approach. Under a learning-based model of AI development, I think it is reasonably likely that the assistance game paradigm will be useful, without solving all problems (in particular, it may not solve <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/r9tYkB2a8Fp4DN8yB/p/FkgsxrGf3QxhfLWHG"">inner alignment</a>).</p><h3>It seems important to figure out coordination</h3><p>Regardless of whether we use assistance games, it&#x2019;s probably worthwhile to figure out how an AI system should coordinate with another agent that is not like itself. I don&#x2019;t have a concrete story here; it&#x2019;s just a general broad intuition.</p><h3>It leads to more human-AI research</h3><p>On my model, the best reason for optimism is that researchers will try to build useful AI systems, they&#x2019;ll run into problems, and then they&#x2019;ll fix those problems. Under this model, a useful intervention to run is to discover the problems sooner. This isn&#x2019;t completely clear, since maybe if you discover the problems sooner, the root causes aren&#x2019;t as obvious, and you are less likely to fix the entire problem -- but I think the main effect is in fact an increase in safety.</p><p>This would be my guess for how this research will most impact AI safety. We (by which I mean mostly Micah and somewhat me) spent a bunch of time cleaning up the code, making it easy for others to work with, creating nice figures, writing up a good blog post, etc. in an effort to have other ML researchers actually make progress on these issues. (However, I wouldn&#x2019;t be too surprised if other researchers used the environment, but for a different purpose.)</p>",rohinmshah,rohinmshah,Rohin Shah,

DRTs are <em>structured games</em> (in the loosest senses of the terms) that involve conversation, and are aimed at helping players who disagree about some topic either figure out the truth about that topic, or come to better understand each others' positions and the sources of their disagreement. An induction method is just any way of trying to get someone to use a DRT. </p><p>I am writing up a description of this procedure here because I plan to use it to test and find DRTs, and I would like to get feedback before I go out and do that. I originally came up with this procedure in order to test Double Crux, and I still plan to. I will describe the first step of that plan in the second half of this post. The first half of the post explains the general procedure and some frames I think might be useful for understanding the second half of the post. </p><p>I would also like to invite others to use the general procedure in order to test or find other DRTs. It seems fairly obvious to me now, but something something hindsight. </p><p>I would like any kind of feedback that you think might make the methodology I describe herein better. I am particularly interested in feedback on the specific procedure I plan to use for testing Double Crux, but feedback on the general procedure would also be great. Any feedback or advice on the statistical analysis of the results of my test procedure for Double Crux would also be much appreciated. </p><p>Readers who are primarily interested in giving feedback on my statistical approach are encouraged to skip to the ""Procedure"" subsection in the second half of the post, and then skip to the ""Statistical Analysis and Preregistration"" subsection.</p><h1>General Procedure</h1><p><em><u>Step 0:</u> </em></p><p>Gather participants and filter them for desired characteristics.

Such questions should have definite correct answers, and it should be hard or impossible for participants to look up the answers during the study.</p><p><em><u>Step 2:  </u></em></p><p>Pair participants according to disagreement measured by total variation distance.</p><p><em><u>Step 3:</u></em></p><p>Randomly assign participants to one of three groups. </p><p><em>Control Group 1</em>: Members are given no special instructions.</p><p><em>Control Group 2</em>: Member are given basic advise on how to have useful conversations with people who disagree with you.</p><p><em>Treatment Group</em>: Members will be induced to use the DRT using the induction method to be tested.</p><p><em><u>Step 4: </u></em></p><p>Inform members of all three groups who they were paired with and what question the pair disagreed about. Members of the first two groups are instructed to have a conversation with their partner with the aim of becoming more confident about what the right answer is. </p><p>For the third group, the induction method is applied either before or during their conversations depending on its design.

This suggests that they treated the conversation as an observation with a likelihood ratio of <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""4:1""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mn""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">4</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.151em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">:</span></span><span class=""mjx-mn MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">1</span></span></span></span></span></span>, which amounts to gaining <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""2""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mn""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">2</span></span></span></span></span></span> bits of evidence from the conversation. If a participant updates away from the correct answer, the likelihood ratio will be below one, and so the log of the likelihood ratio will be negative.</p><p>The second kind of data I would like to collect is the degree to which a pair's beliefs converged after the conversation regardless of the truth of the answer on which they converged. I will measure this by taking the total variation distance of their credence distributions before their conversation, and subtracting from that number the total variation distance between the credence distributions they assigned after their conversation.</p><h2>Constraints on Multiple Choice Questions </h2><p>The multiple choice questions used should be questions for which participants are unlikely to already know the right answer. They should also be questions for which it is reasonable to expect that people might make incremental progress on figuring out the right answer through conversation, eg: ""will president Trump be reelected in 2020"" would be fine, but ""what is Joe Smith's sister's name"" would not. </p><p>The questions should also have the property that if you find out the right answer, it is not completely trivial to convince others of the right answer. Counterintuitive physics puzzles satisfy this criteria, but most raven's progressive matrices questions do not. </p><p>It might be good for there to be a set of neutral questions, such as counterintuitive physics or logic puzzles, or questions about how long it took for spider silk to evolve, as well as a set of controversial or politically sensitive questions, such as who will be elected or nominated for some important political office, or whether the GDP of a country went up or down after a particular policy was implemented. </p><h2>DRTs Are Not Individuated by their Induction Methods</h2><p>The original example of a DRT that I had in mind was Double Crux. Having anchored on Double Crux, the alternative possible DRT-induction method pairs I imagined I might later test shared Double Crux's canonical pedagogical structure: you are taught the technique by someone who knows it, you practice it some, and then you use it with other people. The space of possible DRT-induction method pairs is much larger than this would suggest.</p><p>DRTs are not always transmitted to someone before the first time they are used. Some methods of induction allow the first time someone uses a DRT to be before, or simultaneous with, the first time they learn how it works.</p><p>One example of an induction method that allows participants to use a DRT before they learn how the DRT works is having a trained facilitator facilitate their conversation according to the norms of the DRT.</p><p>Another might be using a program that guides participants through a discussion. Maybe it keeps track of their Cruxes; keeps track of the various topic branches and sub conversations; the different arguments that have been made and what their premises are; keeps track of users' credences and asks them to update them explicitly when a new argument is inputted, etc. If a DRT were codified in such a program, participants might not have to be preemptively instructed in how to use the DRT. The program might be sufficiently intuitive and give participants enough instruction on its own. This would have the added bonus that they could later use that program without having a trained facilitator around.</p><p>I could imagine designing a program like this for Double Crux, but also for other DRTs that are not Double Crux. Of course, you could also design alternative DRTs and transmit them in the way that Double Crux is normally transmitted. This means that whether an accompanying induction method is applied before or during the first time participants use a DRT does not depend much on the nature of the DRT itself. </p><p>I note that the general procedure does not test the efficacy of DRTs in isolation; it tests them together with a particular method of induction. If a DRT totally fails to get any interesting result when we try to induce it with one method, that does not mean that the DRT itself is inefficacious. It might be that the induction method used failed to induce the DRT's use in the participants, or that it induced its use but failed to transmit the most important fragments of the DRT.</p><hr class=""dividerBlock""><h1>Specific Plans to Test Double Crux Induced by an Online Training Module</h1><h2>Procedure</h2><p><em><u>Step 0:</u></em></p><p>I will collect participants on positly.com. I will filter them for not already knowing what Double Crux is. I may also filter them for having completed a bachelor's degree depending on how difficult the final set of questions and the concepts involved in the training module turn out to be. Postily participants are already filtered by Positly for being decent study participants in general. </p><p><em><u>Step 1:</u></em></p><p>I will have them take a questionnaire that contains several multiple choice questions. Some of these will be predictions about politically sensitive topics. Some of these will be physics or logic puzzles. Some will be numerical estimation questions like ""how many miles of road are there in Africa"". I will ask them to assign credence distributions over the multiple choices for each question. </p><p>I will also instruct participants in how to think about assigning credences, and ask participants to assign other credence distributions in order to check their calibration. All those that do not demonstrate calibration above some minimal standard of will not be asked to participate in the larger study. </p><p>For those who do demonstrate some calibration, I will then ask them if they would like to participate in a larger study. I will first explain what sorts of things they can expect to do as part of the study and what sorts of compensation they can expect to earn. I will also explain that any non-identifying data they give me may later be made publicly available. </p><p>If they say yes, I will collect their emails and record their credence assignments on a spreadsheet.</p><p><em><u>Step 2:</u></em></p><p>I will pair participants according to disagreement, preferring larger disagreements to smaller ones. Again, this will be measured by total variation of distance.</p><p><em><u>Step 3:</u></em></p><p>I will then randomly assign pairs to one of three groups:</p><p><em>Control Group 1</em>: Members of this group will not be given any specific advice. </p><p><em>Control Group 2</em>: Members of this group will be given general advice on how to have useful conversations with people they disagree with. I will tell them that they should try to see each other as cooperating to solve a puzzle, that they should see themselves as partners on the same team, that they should try really hard to understand why the other person had such different beliefs from them, and that they should try to ask each other a lot of questions.</p><p><em>Treatment Group</em>: Members of this group will be asked to complete an online training module that is intended to teach them some critical fragment of the Double Crux technique, and asked to Double Crux with their partners in step 4. (More on the design of this module later.)</p><p><em><u>Step 4:</u></em></p><p>Participants will be asked to communicate with the other member of their pair via either a video chat service, or a text chat service. (More on this later.) They will be asked to speak to each other for as long as they would like, but for no less than 30 minutes. </p><p>They will have already been told that they will be paid according to a proper scoring rule scored on the credence distribution they assign in step 5. Members of the control groups will be instructed to use the conversation as an opportunity to find out more about the correct answer to the question. Members of the treatment group will be instructed to Double Crux with their partner.</p><p><em><u>Step 5:</u></em></p><p>I will then have participants assign a new credence distribution over the multiple choice answers for the question they were assigned to discuss, and collect their assignments.</p><p><em><u>Step 6:</u></em></p><p>I may offer participants extra compensation to send records of their conversation during step 1. </p><p>I may then recruit people who can credibly claim to assess Double Crux performance, and have them rate logs or recordings of the conversations for Double Cruxiness. They will rate these logs on a scale from 1 to 10. They should give a 1 to any conversation they consider to not be an instance of Double Crux at all, a 5 to a conversation that seems average Double Cruxy for conversations between people who disagree and know about Double Crux, and a 10 to any conversation that seems like a totally paradigmatic instance of Double Crux. </p><p>If I decide to do this, I will try to design the module without the use of the words ""double"" or ""crux"" so as to minimize the chance that participants use the term in their logs, as that would certainly tip off the raters.</p><p><em><u>Step 7:</u></em></p><p>Reward participants according to a Brier score scored on the distributions they assigned in step 5. </p><h2>Measurements</h2><p>I plan to measure the same quantities mentioned above. I will measure the amount of information gained by each participant from the conversation, and I will measure the degree to which each pair converged. </p><h2>Text Chat or Video Chat?</h2><p>I am genuinely unsure about what medium I should ask people to conduct their conversations through. Video chat is closer to in person conversation, and I personally find the extra bandwidth useful, especially when trying to cooperatively figure something out with someone. However, it would be easier to have participants send text logs than video recordings. Text also offers the advantage of providing a visible log of the conversation for the participants to look over, which is basically the same as giving participants more working memory. When people have conversations in person, they can use pen and paper, which has a similar effect.</p><p>I would be interested to hear other peoples' thoughts on this. </p><h2>Why Have People Rate the Double Cruxiness of the Conversations? </h2><p>I would like to take logs of the conversations and have people rate them for Double Cruxiness so that if I get a negative result, it is more informative. Without step 6, if it turned out that participants in the treatment group got about as much information out of their conversations as members of either control group, we might interpret this as being primarily evidence that the module used in the experiment does not teach Double Crux. </p><p>But if we know that people who understand Double Crux rate the participants in the treatment group as using Double Crux more than those in the control groups, then we can rule out that explanation.</p><p>If the raters rate the treatment group's Double Cruxiness above the level of the control groups, then that suggests that the module teaches Double Crux. As such, a negative result would be some evidence against the efficacy of the Double Crux technique itself.  </p><p>If the raters rate the treatment group's Double Cruxiness near the level of the control groups, this means that the module does not teach Double Crux, or at least it does not teach it any better than giving some basic advice about how to have useful disagreements. </p><p>In that case, the treatment group scoring about as well as control group 2 would not be much evidence against the efficacy of Double Crux itself, although it would be further evidence that the module does not successfully induce the technique.</p><p>A positive result in this case would suggest that those people I consider relative authorities on Double Crux are either not reliable raters of the degree to which the technique is being used, or are not sensitive to the important aspects of its use. I think this would be an interesting thing to learn and investigate further. It might help with the design of future DRTs or training modules.</p><p>I might ultimately leave this step out of a pilot study. I would be more likely to include step 6 in a later follow up to the pilot.  </p><p>If I did decide to include step 6, I will make sure that nobody, including my self, knows how well the treatment group did compared to the control groups until after the rating is done. </p><h2>Designing the Module</h2><p>Although I use Double Crux often, I do not think of myself as a qualified instructor of the technique. I would like the module to be designed primarily by people who can credibly claim to have successfully taught Double Crux multiple times. Preferably it would be designed by people who have also put a lot of thought into figuring out what parts of the technique are most important, and how best to transmit that. I will try to recruit or contract some such folks to help me design the module.</p><p>If they turn out to be too expensive for my current budget, then I will just try my best at designing the module, plagiarizing from the people I would have hired as much as possible, and asking for as much feedback as I can handle along the way. </p><p>I expect that the module should include examples, diagrams, and questions that check for understanding. I would prefer for it to be no longer than 30 minutes, but it might have to be. </p><p>Regardless of who ends up designing it, I will be asking for feedback on the module from other people. </p><h2>Pilot Study </h2><p>My current plan is to pay participants 20 usd just for completing the study, since it is rather intensive. (It might take up to an hour and a half to complete. I will start out offering a lower price and see what happens, but I would be happy to go as high as 20 usd.) I will also offer up to 10 usd in monetary rewards for updating towards the right answer. </p><p>I may or may not offer an additional reward for sending a log if I decide to include step 6 in the pilot study. This would be more likely if I ended up asking participants to use video chat instead of text, since recording video is harder than copying and pasting. </p><p>I would like to have at least 30 participants in each group for the pilot study. </p><h2>Statistical Analysis and Preregistration </h2><p>I plan to use standard significance tests, specifically a two group Welch test and a three group ANOVA test. I will also use the Bayesian method, BEST, described <a href=""http://www.indiana.edu/~kruschke/BEST/?fbclid=IwAR019Fnb93S83oJ0t3vf34jHNyHDSmKnSRCvZEpKEkSnsTXtznMOsaMAu0Q"">here</a>. In this section, I will use a standard difference of means test that assumes equal variance, since it is easier to explain, but I will use a Welch test when actually analyzing the data. It gives similar results to the Welch test for the sample sizes and standard deviations I am working with. You can verify their similarity yourself using this <a href=""http://www.statskingdom.com/150MeanT2uneq.html"">online calculator</a>.</p><p>There are three distributions we are interested in.

This unfortunately requires using a three group ANOVA. The three group ANOVA is more sensitive to sample size and standard deviation than the two group Welch test, and also somewhat weaker. You can verify that it is weaker using this <a href=""https://statpages.info/anova1sm.html"">online calculator</a>. </p><p>I will use ANOVA and appropriate ad hoc tests to compare all three groups, but I will also use the two group Welch test to compare just control group 2 to the treatment group. This is normally frowned upon, but I have two reasons to think that it should not be in this case. </p><p>The first is that in general two significant test results are better than one, even if their combined p-value is higher. I will report the chance of type 1 error for each test individually, and also report the chance that there was any type 1 error at any point in the study. I am now preregistering that I will only compare control group 2 to the treatment group, so there is no chance of me using the two group Welch test to compare both control groups to the treatment group and only reporting whichever result was better.</p><p>The second is that if the treatment group does better than control group 2, I think we can be fairly sure that it does better than control group 1 as well. The point of having control group 1 is that if control group 2 and the treatment group do equally well, without control group 1, this is a fairly boring result. However, if they also do better than control group 1, this suggests that the module works only because coaching of any kind works. This would make a negative result on the comparison between the control group 2 and the treatment group more interesting. </p><p>In any case, the means of two distributions being equal is equivalent to the means of their sample mean distributions being equal: <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\mu_{\bar{x_2}} - \mu_{\bar{x_t}} = 0""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.519em;"">μ</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-texatom"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-texatom""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-munderover""><span class=""mjx-stack""><span class=""mjx-over"" style=""height: 0.096em; padding-bottom: 0.06em; padding-left: 0.265em;""><span class=""mjx-mo"" style=""vertical-align: top;""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.298em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">¯</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-op""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">x</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 83.3%; vertical-align: -0.267em; padding-right: 0.06em;""><span class=""mjx-mn"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">2</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space2""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.298em; padding-bottom: 0.446em;"">−</span></span><span class=""mjx-msubsup MJXc-space2""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.519em;"">μ</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-texatom"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-texatom""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-munderover""><span class=""mjx-stack""><span class=""mjx-over"" style=""height: 0.096em; padding-bottom: 0.06em; padding-left: 0.207em;""><span class=""mjx-mo"" style=""vertical-align: top;""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.298em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">¯</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-op""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">x</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 83.3%; vertical-align: -0.227em; padding-right: 0.06em;""><span class=""mjx-mi"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">t</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.077em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">=</span></span><span class=""mjx-mn MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">0</span></span></span></span></span></span> .

They are based on nothing but my hunches.</p><p>For my estimates concerning the sample standard deviations I am likely to get, Beth Barnes let me look at the data from OpenAI's debate studies. They use a similar method for getting credence assignments and looking at updates. Although the studies looked at participants' credence assignments for their favorite answers, not the correct answers, I still think the standard deviations in their samples are a reasonable estimate for the standard deviations I can expect. </p><p>I wrote a python script to calculate the sample standard deviations for the log likelihood each participant updated with. The sample standard deviations were: [1.054313572588262, 1.1272448020726757, 1.9301510041775782]</p><p>For the third of these studies some participants said that their favorite answer was less likely than random chance would suggest. I conclude from this that these participants were filtered for calibration less than those in the first two studies. I am optimistic that I will get sample standard deviations closer to the first two values than to the second, which would make my results far more significant. </p><p>As stated above, I also plan to use <a href=""https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BEST/vignettes/BEST.pdf"">BEST</a> to do a Bayesian analysis of the results. I will give a few example priors I consider reasonable and their corresponding posteriors. Hopefully, I will also provide a program in R or Python that allows one to input any prior and get a posterior as output. </p><p>If there is a better way to do this than the Welch test or ANOVA, Bayesian or not, preferably while making fewer assumptions about the underlying distributions, I am all ears. I would also be interested in hearing about Bayesian alternatives to the BEST approach. </p><p>I might be missing something important. The Welch test and three group ANOVA are just the standard approaches I found after googling and asking around for a bit. The BEST method was the first thing I found when I googled ""Bayesian comparison of means"".</p><p>In any case, I plan to make all data (aside from the conversation logs and personally identifying data) publicly available. I would encourage folks to analyze that data however they like and let me know what they find. </p><h2>What Happens after You Get Your Result?</h2><p>If I get a positive result, I will look for further funding to do a larger study. If I get a positive result on that larger study, I will have a module that has been empirically shown to help pairs of people who disagree get more information out of talking about their disagreement. I will distribute any such module for free and make all data publicly available.

When I argue that we should 

<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/rent-needs-to-decrease"">bring
rents down</a> by 

<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/make-more-land"">building</a> 

<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/unrestricted-housing"">more</a> 

<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/housing-without-street-parking"">housing</a>, one kind of
response I've gotten is:



</p><p>

</p>

<blockquote>

Why are you trying to move more people into cities?  There's lots of
housing available in the US, it's just not in the currently trendy
cities.  Instead of moving people we should be moving jobs. Why
couldn't Amazon have put their ""second headquarters"" in a
deindustrializing city like Milwaukee instead of splitting it between
DC and NYC?

</blockquote>



<p>

The idea makes sense: these cities were built out for industries that
have moved on, and now they're over-built for current demand.  They
have lots of buildings available, both commercial and residential,
along with a lot of other underutilized infrastructure.

</p>

<p>

One way to look at it, then, is why aren't companies just moving there
on their own?  Company rent would fall, they could pay their employees
less for the same standard of living or effectively give them all
large raises by holding pay constant.  Everyone would waste less time
in traffic.  The host city would be strongly supportive instead of
somewhere between negative and neutral.  What's keeping them put?

</p>

<p>

A major factor is that current employees don't want to move.  If
Google announced it was moving everything to Pittsburgh, ~80% of the
company would quit.  People put down roots and get attached to areas,
generally more so than to jobs.

</p>

<p>

New companies, however, don't have employees they would need to move.
Why do tech startups choose the Bay when almost anywhere else would be
cheaper?  I see two main answers: to be close to their investors and
to be able to hire from a deep talent pool.

</p>

<p>

And this gets us to the real problem with ""let's distribute jobs
across the country"": industries benefit enormously from
centralization.  Being in the main city for your industry means, for a
start:

</p>

<p>

</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Good ideas flow more freely between organizations</p></li>
<li><p>Coordination between organizations is easier</p></li>
<li><p>Switching jobs is easier, so people don't get as stuck in
jobs they don't like</p></li>
<li><p>Ease of switching also allows people to take larger career
risks</p></li>
</ul>



<p>

People expected telecommuting to change this, but even though we have
many technical tools that make remote work far more practical than it
was even ten years ago, physically being in the same place as your
coworkers remains extremely valuable.

</p>

<p>

Industries do vary, however, in how well centralization suits them.
Three groups:

</p>

<p>

</p>

<ul>

<li><p>Industries that are distributed because they depend on resources
that are distributed.  People working in farming, logging, fishing,
mining, and other industries spread out because the best places for
those activities are spread out.</p></li>

<li><p>Industries that are centralized because they don't have
location-based inputs.  Software in the Bay, finance in NYC, film/TV
in LA, biotech in Boston, commodities in Chicago, insurance in
Hartford, etc.</p></li>

<li><p>Industries that need people.  Doctors, teachers, barbers, auto
mechanics, etc will all be a portion of your local population, and
they'll mostly go where the people are.  Centralization still helps,
but people won't travel hundreds of miles to get their hair cut.</p></li>

</ul>



<p>

Many fewer people work in naturally-distributed industries than they
used to.  For example farming is down to only 2% of the population:

</p>

<p>

<a href=""http://www.thadw.us/agricultural-employment-since-1870/""><img src=""https://www.jefftk.com/percent-of-us-workforce-in-agriculture-1870-to-2000.png"" /></a>
<br />
<i><a href=""http://www.thadw.us/agricultural-employment-since-1870/"">Thad
Woodman, Agricultural Employment Since 1870</a></i>

</p>

<p>

An early example of a centralized industry was the auto industry, in
Detroit.  There was nothing about Detroit that made it uniquely good
for producing cars, but as it <a href=""https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2012/02/why-are-all-the-big-american-car-companies-based-in-michigan.html"">became
the consensus location for the industry</a> it developed local culture
and knowledge that had strong advantages for building cars.

</p>

<p>

Detroit also illustrates two major downsides of this centralization:

</p>

<ul>

<li><p>They stopped innovating so much.  It was only because there
were other major centers of automotive production elsewhere that we
were able to get cars as reliable, safe, and efficient as we have
today.</p></li>

<li><p>When their industry dried up, so did the city.  Their cars
weren't the best anymore, they lost business to Japan and others,
massive layoffs, people moved away, the city is much worse than it
was.</p></li>

</ul>



<p>

These two considerations mean we want:

</p>

<ul>

<li><p>A few key cities for each industry, so there can be competition
at scales larger than individual companies.  With international
borders still being a major political force we'll probably be more
towards the ""less central than ideal"" end of the spectrum for a long
time.</p></li>

<li><p>Multiple industries in each city, so that as one industry in a
city becomes more or less successful it isn't carrying the success of
the whole city.  If an industry does fail, others will be able to grow
into their place.  <a href=""https://www.csus.edu/indiv/c/chalmersk/econ180fa08/glaeserboston.pdf"">Reinventing
Boston: 1630-2003</a> (Glaeser 2004) has a good description for how
something like this has worked in Boston.</p></li>

</ul>



<p>

Overall, people working on the same thing in the same place as each
other remains incredibly valuable, and we should let that happen.
Instead of trying to distribute industries that are naturally
centralized, we should let them centralize while managing the risks.
Building more housing doesn't just let people move to where the jobs
are, but also allows people working on other things afford to live in
the city.

<p>Some background. Plants, like all living organisms, need to take in nutrients for metabolism. For animals, the macronutrients needed are large, complex molecules: proteins, carbohydrates, fats. But for plants they are elements: nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium (NPK). Nitrogen is needed in the largest quantities.</p>
<p>Nitrogen is all around us: it constitutes about four-fifths of the atmosphere. But plants can't use atmospheric nitrogen.

</style></span></span>, consists of two atoms held together by a triple covalent bond. The strength of this bond renders nitrogen mostly inert: it doesn't react with much. To use it in chemical processes, plants need other nitrogen-containing molecules. These substances are known as “fixed” nitrogen; the process of turning nitrogen gas into usable form is called fixation.</p>
<p>In nature, nitrogen fixation is performed by bacteria. Some of these bacteria live in the soil; some live in a symbiotic relationship on the roots of certain plants, such as peas and other legumes.</p>
<p>Nitrogen availability is one of the top factors in plant growth and therefore in agriculture. The more fixed nitrogen is in the soil, the more crops can grow. Unfortunately, when you farm a plot of land, natural processes don't replace the nitrogen as fast as it is depleted.</p>
<p>Pre-industrial farmers had no chemistry or advanced biology to guide them, but they knew that soil would lose its fertility over the years, and they had learned a few tricks. One was fertilization with natural substances, particularly animal waste, which contains nitrogen. Another was crop rotation: planting peas, for instance, would replace some of the nitrogen in the soil, thanks to those nitrogen-fixing bacteria on their roots.</p>
<p>But these techniques could only go so far. As the world population increased in the 19th century, more and more farmland was needed. Famine was staved off, for a time, by the opening of the prairies of the New World, but those resources were finite. The world needed fertilizer.</p>
<p>An island off the coast of Peru where it almost never rains had accumulated untold centuries of—don't laugh—seagull droppings, some of the world's best known natural fertilizer. An industry was made out of mining guano on these islands, where it was piled several stories high, and shipping it all over the world. When that ran out after a couple decades, attention turned inland to the Atacama Desert, where, with no rainfall and no life, unusual minerals grew in crystals on the rocks. The crystals included <em>salitre</em>, or Chilean saltpeter, a nitrogen salt that could be made into fertilizer.</p>
<p>It could be made into something else important, too: gunpowder. It turns out that nitrogen is a crucial component not only of fertilizer, but also of explosives. Needing it both to feed and to arm their people, every country considered saltpeter a strategic commodity. Peru, Chile and Bolivia went to war over the saltpeter resources of the Atacama in the late 1800s (Bolivia, at the time, had a small strip of land in the desert, running to the ocean; it lost that strip in the war and has remained landlocked ever since).</p>
<p>By the end of the 19th century, as population continued to soar, it was clear that the Chilean saltpeter would run out within decades, just as the guano had. Sir William Crookes, head of the British Academy of Sciences, warned that the world was heading for mass famine, a true <a href=""https://rootsofprogress.org/the-malthusian-trap"">Malthusian catastrophe</a>, unless we discovered a way to synthesize fertilizer. And he called on the chemists of the world to do it.</p>
<p>Nearby, in Germany, other scientists were thinking the same thing. Germany was highly dependent on salt shipped halfway around the world from Chile. But Germany did not have the world's best navy. If—God forbid—Germany were ever to be at war with England (!), they would quickly blockade Germany and deprive it of nitrogen. Germany would have no food and no bombs—not a good look, in wartime.</p>
<hr>
<p>The prospect of synthesizing fixed nitrogen was tantalizing. After all, the nitrogen itself is abundant in the atmosphere. A product such as ammonia, <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\mathrm{NH_3}""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-texatom""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">N</span></span><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">H</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mn"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">3</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>, could be made from that and hydrogen, which of course is present in water. All you need is a way to put them together in the right combination.</p>
<p>The problem, again, is that triple covalent bond. Owing to the strength of that bond, it takes very high temperatures to rip <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\mathrm{N_2}""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-texatom""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">N</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mn"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">2</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> apart. More troublesome is that ammonia is by comparison a weak molecule. So at temperatures high enough to separate the nitrogen atoms, the ammonia basically burns up.</p>
<p>Fritz Haber was the chemist who solved the fundamental problem. He found that increasing the pressure of the gases allowed him to decrease the temperature. At very high pressures, he could start to get an appreciable amount of ammonia. By introducing the right catalyst, he could increase the production to levels that were within reach of a viable industrial process.</p>
<p>Carl Bosch was the industrialist at the German chemical company BASF who led the team that figured out how to turn this into a profitable process, at scale. The challenges were enormous. To start with, the pressures required by the process were immense, around 200 atmospheres. The required temperatures, too, were very high. No one had ever done industrial chemistry in that regime before, and Bosch's team had to invent almost everything from scratch, pioneering an entirely new subfield of high-pressure industrial chemistry. Their furnaces kept exploding—not only from the pressure itself, but because hydrogen was eating away at the steel walls of the container, as it forced into them. No material was strong enough and inexpensive enough to serve as the container wall. Finally Bosch came up with an ingenious system in which the furnaces had an inner lining of material to protect the steel, which would be replaced on a regular basis.</p>
<p>A further challenge was the catalyst: Haber had used osmium, an extremely rare metal. BASF bought up the entire world's supply, but it wasn't enough to produce the quantities they needed. They experimented with thousands of other materials, finally settling on a catalyst with an iron base combined with other elements.</p>
<p>This is the Haber-Bosch process: it turns pure nitrogen and hydrogen gas into ammonia. The nitrogen can be isolated from the atmosphere (by cooling air until it condenses into liquid, then carefully increasing the temperature: different substances boil at different temperatures, so this process separates them). Hydrogen can be produced from water by electrolysis, or, these days, found in natural gas deposits. The output of the process, ammonia, is the precursor of many important products, including fertilizers and explosives.</p>
<p>The new BASF plant that Bosch built began turning out tons of ammonia a day. It beat out all competing processes (including one that used electric arcs through the air), and provided the world with fertilizer—cheaper and of more consistent quality than could be obtained from the salts of Chile, which were abandoned before they ran out.</p>
<p>Haber-Bosch fed the world—but it also prolonged World War I, and later helped fuel the rise of Hitler.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>The Alchemy of Air</em> is as much about the lives of Haber and Bosch, and what happened after their process became a reality, as it is about the science and technology of the process itself. Even though the technology was my main interest this time, I found the history captivating.</p>
<p>Haber was a Jew, at a time when Jews were second-class citizens in Germany. Rather than denouncing the society he lived in, this seemed to cause Haber to seek its approval. After his scientific achievement with ammonia, he got a high-status job at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institutes in Berlin, and sought to be an adviser to the Kaiser himself. Jews were barred from military service, but Haber was able to become a science adviser to the military—even pioneering the use of poison gas in WW1, a role that left him with a reputation as a war criminal.</p>
<p>Haber believed that if Jews showed what good, patriotic German citizens they could be, they could eventually be accepted as equals. Decades later, when the Nazis came to power and began “cleansing” Jews first out of the German government, then out of all of society, Haber saw his dream of acceptance fall completely to pieces. He died, shortly before WW2, in great distress.</p>
<p>Bosch, on the other hand, held liberal political views and was against the Nazis. He even tried to speak out against them, and in a personal meeting with Hilter made a futile argument for freedom of inquiry and better treatment of the Jews. But at the same time he made deals with the Nazis to secure funding for his chemical company—by then he was the head, not only of BASF, but of a broader industry association called IG Farben. He was building a massive chemical plant in the heart of Germany, at Leuna, to produce not only ammonia but also what he saw as his <em>magnum opus:</em> synthetic gasoline, made from coal. In the end Farben became virtually a state company and provided much of the material Germany needed for WW2, including ammonia, gasoline, and rubber.</p>
<p>Bosch died shortly after the war began. On his deathbed, he predicted that the war would be a disaster for Germany. It would go well at first, he said, and Germany would occupy France and maybe even Britain. But then Hitler would make the fatal mistake of invading Russia. In the end, the skies would darken with Allied planes, and much of Germany would be destroyed. It happened as he predicted, and Bosch's beloved Leuna was a major target, ultimately crippled by wave after wave of Allied bombing raids.</p>
<hr>
<p>Synthetic ammonia is one of the most important industrial products of the modern world, and so Haber-Bosch is one of the most important industrial processes. Around 1% of the <em>total</em> energy of the economy is devoted to it, and Hager estimates that half the nitrogen atoms in your body came from it. It's a crucial part of the story of industrial agriculture, and so a crucial part of the story of how we became <a href=""https://rootsofprogress.org/smart-rich-and-free"">smart, rich and free</a>.</p>

He notes that about 5% of Americans engage in consensual nonmonogamy, while 17% of Americans in the 2014 Less Wrong survey indicated that they did. My expectation is that the number for both is slightly higher today. In service of this goal, Falkovich developed several theories and surveyed a number of his readers. His results ended up inconclusive.</p><p>Since this involves the intersection of the two themes of this blog &#x2013; rationality and nonmonogamous relationships &#x2013; I thought I would offer my own theories about why this might be the case. I don&#x2019;t have any survey data, but if anyone is planning on doing a survey, you may want to include some questions evaluating these theories.</p><h3><strong>1. THE TRADITIONAL JUSTIFICATIONS FOR MONOGAMY ARE IRRATIONAL</strong></h3><p>Rationalist try to be rational about everything, so we also try to be <a href=""http://livingwithinreason.com/tag/rational-relationships/"">rational about relationships</a>. Relationship anarchy <a href=""http://livingwithinreason.com/2018/08/08/relationship-anarchy-a-personal-manifesto/"">is my attempt</a> to derive a rational relationship style from first principals.</p><p>While <a href=""http://livingwithinreason.com/2013/04/25/toward-a-more-skeptical-monogamy/"">there are some good reasons to be monogamous</a>, anecdotally, the most common justifications I hear for monogamy are jealousy-related. People don&#x2019;t want open relationships because they would be jealous of their metamours (and often, their partners). But jealousy is just an emotion, and rationalists have a tradition of distrusting emotions. Falkovich somewhat addressed this in his first theory &#x2013; overcoming intuitions:</p><blockquote>A core tenet of Rationality is that what&#xA0;<em>feels</em>&#xA0;true is not necessarily what&#xA0;<em>is&#xA0;</em>true. What feels true may simply be what is pleasant, politically expedient, or what fits your biases and preconceptions. The willingness to entertain the idea that your intuitions about truth may be wrong is a prerequisite for learning Rationality, and Rationality further cultivates that skill.</blockquote><p>Unfortunately, Falkovich&#x2019;s analysis is frustrated by the lack of variance in his survey data on whether people overcome their intuitions. I have a feeling that this result was limited somewhat by the survey questions, which asked participants to rate how much they trusted their intuitions and whether they ever significantly changed their emotions through analysis and introspection.</p><p>The difficulty is that there are a whole host of cognitive biases encouraging us to believe that yes, of course we trust our cognition more than our intuition, but that can easily just be motivated reasoning. Some people will admit that they &#x201C;go with their gut,&#x201D; but that sort of thing is frowned on in the rationality community, so it doesn&#x2019;t surprise me that most of the participants claimed to trust their cognition more regardless of whether that&#x2019;s actually the case.</p><p>The small amount of variance in Falkovich&#x2019;s survey <em>was</em> highly correlated with polyamory, so that lends some credibility to the argument that rationalists choose polyamory because they do not reflexively trust their feelings of jealousy.</p><h3><strong>2. GAME THEORY</strong></h3><p>If you spend enough time around my rationalist friends, they will start talking about prisoner&#x2019;s dilemmas. It&#x2019;s inevitable. Scott Alexander has a whole <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/QxZs5Za4qXBegXCgu/introduction-to-game-theory-sequence-guide"">game theory sequence</a>. Rationalists love game theory, and in particular, they love coming up with coordination strategies to turn things from zero-sum to positive-sum games.</p><p>Monogamy is a zero-sum game. Each person gets one partner, and once that partner is taken, they are removed from the dating pool for everyone else. There is no sharing, coordination, or trading. There are no complicated strategies that can be optimized. In other words, it&#x2019;s not interesting to rationalists.</p><p>Nonmonogamy, properly coordinated, is a positive-sum game. Multiple people can partner with the same person and unless they always want undivided attention at the exact same times, they can coordinate so everyone is better off. Nonmonogamy allows parties to, for example, have a date with one partner while their other partner is busy, spend time with multiple partners at the same time, and coordinate to compensate for imbalances in sex drive. Parties rarely want exactly the same thing from their partners, so there are usually large opportunities for emotional arbitrage.</p><p>I strongly suspect that this impulse toward coordination and creating positive-sum interactions underlies a substantial amount of rationalists&#x2019; preferences for nonmonogamy.</p><h3><strong>3. GENDER IMBALANCE</strong></h3><p>On Falkovich&#x2019;s survey, 78% of the respondents where heterosexual men. 11% were women interested in men. That&#x2019;s a 7:1 ratio. Other surveys of the rationalist community have indicated similar gender and sexuality breakdowns.</p><p>In the Robert Heinlein novel <em>The Moon is a Harsh Mistress</em>, the moon is originally used as a penal colony, and as a result has a population that is mostly men and few women. The result is that, out of necessity, the society developed to allow women to date multiple men. When there are multiple heterosexual men for each woman interested in dating them, you either have nonmonogamy or you have a lot of lonely men.</p><p>A similar thing may be happening with the rationalist community. It&#x2019;s not the moon, so rationalists are free to date outside of the community, but people often want to date like-minded people. Most rationalists would probably prefer to date other rationalists. Rationalist women likely have multiple suitors all the time, and may find more than one appealing. Unless they are particularly high-status, rationalist men then face the choice of embracing nonmonogamy, dating outside the community, or not dating at all. Notable also is that most of the high-status men in the rationalist community are nonmonogamous. Under those constraints, nonmonogamy may be the ideal choice for many of us.</p><h2><strong>Further Study</strong></h2><p>Ozy is <a href=""https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2019/10/21/polyamory-survey/"">currently recruiting nonmonogamous survey participants</a>. If you are nonmonogamous, please consider taking the survey. I have never done any kind of survey design, so I do not know how one would test the above theories. However, if someone is planning on doing a survey of the rationalist community and is interested in this question, I encourage you to consider the above and perhaps try to design some questions to test its accuracy.</p>",wfenza,wes-f,Wes F,

<li><span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\mathbb{E}(U \mid \pi_0) > \mathbb{E}(U\mid \pi_V^*)""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-texatom""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-ams-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">E</span></span></span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">(</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.084em;"">U</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">∣</span></span><span class=""mjx-msubsup MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-base"" style=""margin-right: -0.003em;""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.003em;"">π</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mn"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">0</span></span></span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">)</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">&gt;</span></span><span class=""mjx-texatom MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-ams-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">E</span></span></span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">(</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.084em;"">U</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">∣</span></span><span class=""mjx-msubsup MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-base"" style=""margin-right: -0.003em;""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.003em;"">π</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-stack"" style=""vertical-align: -0.327em;""><span class=""mjx-sup"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; padding-bottom: 0.255em; padding-left: 0.076em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mo"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.151em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">∗</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mi"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.186em;"">V</span></span></span></span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">)</span></span></span></span></span></span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, rearranging these gives:</p>

Naively, it seems like the fact that all Elm functions are pure would make it easy. But I've still never really been able to test the things I really want to.</p>

<p>It's possible that I'm not very good at writing tests in general. But even if that's true, I don't think it's the whole story.</p>

<p>I have another hypothesis, which is: much of the reason is that although Elm functions are <em>pure</em>, in the sense of ""given the same input, they return the same output"" - they aren't necessarily <em>transparent</em>, in the sense of ""you can look at the output and verify that it's correct"".</p>

<p>To recap<a href=""#fn:accessibility"">2</a>, I would describe the Elm architecture as consisting of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><code>Model</code> - a type describing the data you're interested in. This is usually mostly transparent. There are some opaque blobs where components haven't exposed their internals, but I think those mostly aren't the kind of opacity that gets in the way<a href=""#fn:philosophically-opposed"">3</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>Msg</code> - a type describing the messages your app passes around. Again, mostly transparent, with opaque blobs where components haven't exposed their messages. I feel like this opacity is maybe a bit more annoying, but still not very.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>update : Msg -&gt; Model -&gt; (Model, Cmd Msg)</code> - a function describing the logic of your app (or whatever it is you're architecting). The <code>Model</code> and <code>Msg</code> are still transparent, but the second return value is a <code>Cmd Msg</code> which is completely opaque, and which is the main source of the problem.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>view : Model -&gt; Html Msg</code> - a function describing the rendering of your app. <code>Html Msg</code> is also arguably opaque, but you can inspect it using <a href=""https://github.com/brian-watkins/elmer"">elmer</a><a href=""#fn:elmer"">4</a>, or (as I discovered while writing this post) the <code>Test.Html</code> modules in the <a href=""https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-explorations/test/1.2.2/"">test</a> package. I'm not sure if you can inspect it as deeply as you might want, I haven't explored these much yet.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Now, in my experience<a href=""#fn:experience"">5</a>, a lot of the logic in an app is contained in the way the <code>update</code> function chains. ""After receiving <em>this</em> message, we send a command which eventually results in receiving <em>that</em> message, and then we want to put <em>some value</em> in the model."" And we can't test those chains, because <code>Cmd</code> is opaque. So that's part of why I haven't liked writing Elm tests.</p>

<p>But I think I've found a method that will help, at least somewhat. You don't need to rewrite anything except your <code>update</code> function, and I actually think it's a mild improvement even if you ignore testing. I call it the Effect pattern.</p>

<p>We've implemented this pattern at work, in a couple of places. When I first did so, the first two tests that I wrote both revealed bugs in my code. (I think I'd known about both of those bugs but forgotten them. I wasn't consciously expecting the tests to fail.) Neither of those tests needed to be updated when I fixed the bugs. I think this is a good sign, but it's not very strong evidence. Beyond that, I mostly have theory.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>I'm going to demonstrate with a simple app. It'll be buggy, and the bug will be hard to test for. Then I'm going to refactor the app to make it more testable, and write a test. Then I'm going to fix the bug, and verify that the test now passes. I think the app is too simple to make the benefits really obvious, but hopefully I can convince you anyway<a href=""#fn:convince"">6</a>.</p>

<p>So <a href=""https://ellie-app.com/6XP8K8dLqZda1"">here's the app</a>. It has a number, and a button to increase the number by one, and a button to multiply it by two. When you press one of those buttons, the number gets ""saved to the server""; normally that would be an http request, but we emulate that by just sending a time delayed response. There's a message telling you whether the number has been successfully saved yet.</p>

<p>Actually, most of the app supports increasing the number by any integer, and multiplying it by any integer. That's not implemented in the view though. The <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/109910/what-do-the-terms-doylist-doylian-and-watsonian-mean"">Watsonian</a> explanation for this is that the developer has a habit of overengineering things. The Doylist explanation is that it makes the interesting bits more interesting, but not significantly more complicated; and the view code is boring.</p>

<p>The bug is: if you press buttons quickly, the ""saved"" message will temporarily be wrong. You've sent two messages to the server, and one hasn't come back yet; the number that's been saved is not the number on display. Silly, but I think it works as a demonstration.</p>

<p>(There are surely also bugs related to the size of numbers, but I'm not interested in those right now. Additionally, a real life server would have other problems like ""sometimes requests will fail"" and ""sometimes requests will be handled out of order""; the second in particular is hairy, but I haven't emulated these possibilities.)</p>

<p>Here's the update function:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>update : Msg -&gt; Model -&gt; (Model, Cmd Msg)
update msg model =
    case msg of
        IncBy n -&gt;
            ( { model | count = model.count + n, saved = False }
            , fakeSaveCount (model.count + n)
            )
        MultBy n -&gt;
            ( { model | count = model.count * n, saved = False }
            , fakeSaveCount (model.count * n)
            )
        Saved -&gt;
            ( { model | saved = True }, Cmd.none )

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can probably guess roughly what <code>Model</code> and <code>Msg</code> look like just from that.</p>

<p>As written, how would you test for the bug? I think the way to do it is to write a wrapper <code>update1 msg model = Tuple.first &lt;| update msg model</code> that ignores the <code>Cmd</code>. Then test that</p>

<div><div><pre><code>initialModel
    |&gt; update1 (IncBy 1)
    |&gt; update1 (IncBy 1)
    |&gt; Saved
    |&gt; .saved
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>is <code>False</code>. And that works, but you need to know exactly what messages get sent in response to <code>IncBy 1</code>. In this case that's easy. In more involved cases,  you'll need to know it for every <code>Msg</code> constructor, and you're going to make a mistake.</p>

<p>Here's how I'd rewrite for testability:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>type Effect = ESaveCount Int

update : Msg -&gt; Model -&gt; (Model, Cmd Msg)
update msg model =
    let (newModel, effs) = updateE msg model
    in (newModel, Cmd.batch &lt;| List.map (\e -&gt; runEffect e model) effs)

updateE : Msg -&gt; Model -&gt; (Model, List Effect)
updateE msg model =
    case msg of
        IncBy n -&gt;
            ( { model | count = model.count + n, saved = False }
            , [ESaveCount (model.count + n)]
            )
        MultBy n -&gt;
            ( { model | count = model.count * n, saved = False }
            , [ESaveCount (model.count + n)]
            )
        Saved -&gt;
            ( { model | saved = True }, [] )

runEffect : Effect -&gt; Model -&gt; Cmd Msg
runEffect eff _ =
    case eff of
        ESaveCount n -&gt; fakeSaveCount n
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That is, we split it into two parts. One part updates the model, and describes the side effects transparently. The other part turns the transparent side effects into opaque ones.</p>

<p>Even if we're not testing this, I kind of like it. It's nice to have a complete list of possible side effects in one place, where it isn't mixed in with model updates. But I do also want to be able to test it. Obviously, now we test <code>updateE</code> instead of <code>update</code>. Is that any better? I think so.</p>

<p>Here's a simple example of something we can now test that we couldn't before: ""whenever <code>update</code> changes <code>model.count</code>, it makes a server request to save the new value; and whenever it makes a server request to save a value, that value is now in <code>model.count</code>."" (We may need to write fuzzers for our <code>Msg</code> and <code>Model</code> to do this.) To do this, we need to trust that <code>runEffect</code> works properly, that <code>ESaveCount</code> actually generates a server request; but I think that's a fairly okay thing to trust.</p>

<p>But that's small fry. I spoke above about chaining the update function, and that's harder. If you're going to do it properly, you still need to know what messages get sent in response to every <code>Effect</code> constructor, and you can't learn that from calling the function. But I still think this is an improvement: if done right, I would expect (and my limited experience agrees) that typically <code>Effect</code> will have many fewer constructors than <code>Msg</code>, and for each one, the transformation to messages is fairly simple.</p>

<p>Here's a helper function that you can use to test <code>updateE</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>runUpdates
    : (state -&gt; msg -&gt; model -&gt; (state, (model, List effect)))
    -&gt; (state -&gt; effect -&gt; model -&gt; (state, List msg))
    -&gt; state
    -&gt; model
    -&gt; List (List msg)
    -&gt; (state, model)
runUpdates updateE runEffect initialState initialModel messages =
    let go = runUpdates updateE runEffect
    in case messages of
        [] -&gt; (initialState, initialModel)
        [] :: moreMsgs -&gt; go initialState initialModel moreMsgs
        (msg1 :: moreMsgs1) :: moreMoreMsgs -&gt;
            let (newState1, (newModel, effs)) =
                    updateE initialState msg1 initialModel
                (newState2, newMsgs) =
                    List.foldl
                        (\e (s, m) -&gt; runEffect s e newModel
                            |&gt; Tuple.mapSecond ((++) m)
                        )
                        (newState1, [])
                        effs
            in go newState2 newModel ((moreMsgs1 ++ newMsgs) :: moreMoreMsgs)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>On a high level, the way it works is this: you pass it your regular <code>updateE</code> function and a mocked <code>runEffect</code> function, together with an initial model and a list of messages to send. The messages get sent, one at a time, to the model. Any effects caused by <code>updateE</code> are handled by the mock <code>runEffect</code>, which returns a list of additional messages to be sent in future. We keep running until there are no more messages.</p>

<p>There are two complications. One is that we also thread through some arbitrary state, that can be updated both by <code>updateE</code> and <code>runEffect</code><a href=""#fn:updateE-state"">7</a>. We'll see the value of that later, but if you don't need it,</p>

<div><div><pre><code>stateless : (a -&gt; b -&gt; c) -&gt; (() -&gt; a -&gt; b -&gt; ((), c))
stateless f () a b = ((), f a b)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>is a helper function that lets you forget about it.</p>

<p>The other complication is that we pass in a <em>nested</em> list of messages. That's to give us some control over timing. Any messages returned by <code>runEffect</code> will be handled after the current ""batch"" of messages, but before the next ""batch"". So if you want to test the sequency ""run <code>msg1</code>, then <code>msg2</code>, then handle the results of <code>msg1</code>"", you would pass in <code>[[ msg1, msg2 ]]</code>. If you want to test the sequence ""run <code>msg1</code>, handle its results, then run <code>msg2</code>"", you would pass in <code>[ [msg1], [msg2] ]</code>.</p>

<p>I have a feeling this won't always be enough control, and in future the mocked <code>runEffect</code> will need to return <code>List (List msg)</code> in place of <code>List msg</code>. (With the first item being messages to run immediately, the second being items to run between the current and the next batch, and so on. You'd get the current behaviour by returning <code>[ [], msgs ]</code>.) But it suffices for now.</p>

<p>And here's one way to test the app:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>type alias TState = (Int, List Expectation)

testSave : Test
testSave =
    let
        mockUpdateE : TState -&gt; Msg -&gt; Model -&gt; (TState, (Model, List Effect))
        mockUpdateE (n, exps) msg model =

        let ((_, exps), _) =

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I admit, this is pretty ugly. But I think it's conceptually quite simple. The state keeps track of two things: how many save requests are currently ""in flight"", which gets updated as we step through; and a list of assertions, which we verify at the end. Every time we send a request (with <code>ESaveCount</code>), we increase the in-flight count. Every time we receive a Saved message, we decrease it, and add a new assertion to the list: <code>model.saved</code> should be <code>True</code> iff there are no requests remaining in-flight.</p>

<p>You can see this version of the app <a href=""https://ellie-app.com/6YqM2vkLWkba1"">here</a>. Note that to avoid the hassle of playing with <code>Test.Runner</code>, I've replaced the <code>Test</code> with an <code>Expectation</code> by commenting out the <code>test ""...""</code> line (but nothing underneath), and put the result in the view. You can remove the second <code>IncBy</code> and check that it now passes (because if there's only one <code>IncBy</code>, the bug doesn't exhibit).</p>

<p>Now to fix the bug, and see what effect that has on the tests. If you can't fix a bug without changing the tests you wrote for it, that's a bad sign about your tests.</p>

<p>The test uncovered the bug by keeping track of some additional state. So the obvious thing to do is to move that state into the model. Count the number of requests in-flight, and only count as ""saved"" if there are none<a href=""#fn:savedCount"">8</a>. In fact, we no longer need <code>saved</code> as a field at all; as written in the test, <code>saved</code> is true iff there are no in-flight requests.</p>

<p>(This doesn't work in the real world, where requests can fail. I think it's fine as a demonstration.)</p>

<p>Removing <code>saved</code> actually does mean we need to rewrite the test. But only minorly, and we can do that before fixing the bug. All we need is to replace the reference <code>newModel.saved</code> with <code>isSaved newModel</code> where <code>isSaved = .saved</code>. Then when we fix the bug, we rewrite that as <code>isSaved m = m.inFlight == 0</code>, and the test passes with no more changes. We'll want to use that function in the <code>view</code> anyway. (Avoiding this kind of thing is one reason people like to write opaque models.)</p>

<p>You can see the fixed version of the app <a href=""https://ellie-app.com/6YqQVQSSDZ8a1"">here</a>.</p>

<p>However… now that we've put that state in the model, although the test still works, it's looking a bit silly. We've got some state in the tests that should always be identical to the state in the model; why not just test that the model is updating the state correctly?</p>

<p>So here are some other tests that we could write (but that I'm not going to, for time reasons):</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>We could test that, given the same messages as above, the model doesn't become <code>isSaved</code> until the very end of <code>runUpdate</code>. We can still do that with <code>runUpdates</code>; our state parameter is now <code>List Model</code>, we use <code>mockUpdateE</code> to keep track of every intermediate model (and <code>mockRunEffect</code> no longer needs to deal with state at all), and then finally verify that <code>isSaved</code> is false for all but the last. (This test we could have written with the old model. As described it fails if, in future, <code>Saved</code> starts having other effects - maybe it wants to send something to a port. We can get around that by doing more bookkeeping, but we could also simply decide that <code>mockRunEffect</code> will pretend it doesn't have those effects.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We could test that any update which returns an <code>ESaveCount</code> also increases <code>inFlight</code>; and further, that any messages sent in response to <code>ESaveCount</code> will decrease <code>inFlight</code>. I think this test is most valuable if it uses a mocked <code>runEffect</code> that's also used in other tests.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Really though, I'm not sure what's best. I do think the Effect pattern will help.</p>

<h3>Further thoughts</h3>

<p>We haven't used this much yet, so there's a lot left to explore. Here are some thoughts I've had, but not developed very far, in no particular order.</p>

<p><strong>Nomenclature.</strong> We've gone from <code>update</code> to <code>update</code>, <code>updateE</code> and <code>runEffects</code>. I currently think <code>runEffects</code> is an okay name, but I feel like with no historical baggage, the name <code>update</code> would have gone to <code>updateE</code>. Then what would <code>update</code> be called? I left it as-is partly to avoid stepping on historical toes, and partly because I don't know. <code>runUpdate</code>? That would give us the pattern ""<code>update</code> functions update the model and return some kind of what-next value, <code>run</code> functions produce <code>Cmd</code>s"". (Of course, <code>runUpdates</code> violates that pattern. Maybe that should become <code>foldUpdate</code>…?)</p>

<p>Also, we'll want a helper function to convert <code>updateE</code> and <code>runEffects</code> into the correct form. What do we call that function? The only sensible suggestion I have is <code>liftUpdate</code>, but I'm not sure I like it.</p>

<p><strong>Randomness.</strong> The test I've demonstrated was deterministic. So have all the tests I've written for <code>Effect</code> so far. (At least one used a fuzzed input, but that doesn't feel like it counts.) To get randomness I imagine you'd need to put a <code>Seed</code> in the state parameter of <code>runUpdates</code>, and then use <a href=""https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/latest/Random#step""><code>Random.step</code></a> (maybe with <a href=""https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-explorations/test/1.2.2/Test-Runner#fuzz""><code>Test.Runner.fuzz</code></a> to get you the <code>Generator</code> that you need).</p>

<p><strong>Simpler test helpers.</strong> <code>runUpdates</code> is quite complicated, and as mentioned, I suspect it'll need to be even more so. I think most tests probably won't use all of its features. What simpler variants of <code>runUpdates</code> are worth creating (and what should they be named)? An obvious candidate is a variant with no state. Maybe also a variant that returns a list of models instead of just the final model.</p>

<p><strong>Full state machine.</strong> In Haskell we use <a href=""https://github.com/advancedtelematic/quickcheck-state-machine#readme"">quickcheck-state-machine</a>, which I really like. Could we do something similar in Elm? I think it would be possible, though probably looking quite different. Elm doesn't have all of the type-level features that QSM relies on, but it also doesn't have all of the features that QSM needs to support.</p>

<p><strong>Should <code>runEffect</code> see the model?</strong> Reasons yes: it simplifies the <code>Effect</code> constructors; it reduces total amount of code; it allows one <code>stateless</code> function to work with both <code>updateE</code> and <code>runEffects</code>. Reasons no: it gives <code>runEffect</code> more rope to hang you with (more likely to be complicated, more likely to diverge in the codebase and test suite). We went with yes because in one of our components, many constructors would have needed many parameters. But we probably could have refactored a little so that many constructors would have needed only one parameter each.</p>

<p><strong>Can you reuse mocked <code>runEffect</code> functions?</strong> I touched on this above. That is, will you be able to write just one or two per component and use those in most of the tests for that component? (If not directly, then just wrapping them in some state-updating code that doesn't change the <code>Msg</code> they return.) Or will each test need a separate one? I certainly hope you can reuse them. If not, that might diminish a lot of the value. The fewer you have, the easier it is to keep them all correct when the real one changes.</p>

<p>(What if you have a potentially large number of functions, but selected by a configuration parameter? I think depending on how this is handled, it could be closer to either end of the scale.)</p>

<p><strong>Composability.</strong> A component using this pattern can be embedded in one that doesn't, no problem. You just don't get any of the benefits in the parent.</p>

<p>What if you embed a non-Effect component in an Effect component? This forces you to put some <code>Cmd</code> in your <code>Effect</code> type. How do you test that? I'm not sure you reasonably can. So far I think we've just avoided testing those parts of our components.</p>

<p>What if you embed an Effect component in another Effect component? In the codebase, I imagine your parent's <code>Effect</code> type has a constructor <code>ChildEffect Child.Effect</code> which in turn calls <code>Child.runEffect</code>. That lets you test the parent component, but… you may need to mock <code>runEffect</code> for every child component, and that doesn't sound fun. (If the mocked functions do turn out to be fairly reusable, maybe not so bad.)</p>

<p>Also, if you want to provide an Effect component in a library, you may want the <code>Effect</code> type to be opaque (like <code>Model</code> and <code>Msg</code> often are today). But then if you want people to be able to test your component in theirs, maybe that makes you responsible for providing suitable mocked <code>runEffect</code> functions.</p>

<p><strong>Unconventional updates.</strong> I've been assuming your existing <code>update</code> function has type <code>Msg -&gt; Model -&gt; (Model, Cmd Msg)</code>. But a lot don't. A common pattern is something like <code>Msg -&gt; Model -&gt; (Model, Cmd Msg, MsgToParent)</code> where <code>MsgToParent</code> is something that the parent may need to act on. (In our case, it's often just global state that needs to be sent back up in turn.) How do you handle this kind of thing?</p>

<p>In the codebase, I think the correct decomposition for this is still to change only the <code>Cmd Msg</code> return value, since that's the only opaque one, and for <code>runEffect</code> to be the same as it would be otherwise. (You could give it <code>MsgToParent</code> as an extra parameter, but like with <code>Model</code> that won't give you any extra power. By default I wouldn't do it, but I don't think it would be an obviously bad idea.) If you had two opaque return values… honestly I don't think I've seen this and I don't think I want to speculate about what to do in that situation.</p>

<p>In the test suite, you won't be able to use the existing <code>runUpdates</code> function. What to do instead? It might prove useful to have a <code>runUpdates3</code> (or something) which can handle this case, but I'm not sure exactly how that would work.</p>

<p>Another possibility would be using wrappers to put your <code>updateE</code> in the right shape. For example, maybe you can do <code>type EffectOrMsg = Effect Effect | MsgToParent MsgToParent</code>, and then combine the final two results of <code>updateE</code>. I don't know if that would always get you what you want.</p>

<h3>tl;dr</h3>

<p>You can take your existing function <code>update : Msg -&gt; Model -&gt; (Model, Cmd Msg)</code>, and decompose it into two others:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>updateE : Msg -&gt; Model -&gt; (Model, List Effect)</code></li>
  <li><code>runEffects : Effect -&gt; Model -&gt; Cmd Msg</code></li>
</ul>

<p>defining the new <code>Effect</code> type as whatever makes this decomposition work nicely. I think this is a slight improvement in the codebase; and independently of that, I think it helps you to write better tests.</p>

<i>Content warning: discussion of allergy attacks.</i>



</p><p>

<i>Epistemic warning: I know very little and this is total
speculation.  Don't do anything in this post unless this becomes the
recommended way of dealing with allergy attacks.</i>

</p>

<p>

Imagine you're walking in a remote area with someone who has a severe
allergy to bee stings, and they get stung.  They don't have their
Epi-Pen (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epinephrine_autoinjector"">epinephrine
autoinjector</a>), there's no one else around, and you're far from
everything.  There's clearly not time for an ambulance, and they start
going into anaphylactic shock.  I think it's possible that the best
response is to try to kill them.

</p>

<p>

Wait, what?

</p>

<p>

Well, not actually try to kill them, but make them think you're trying
to kill them.  Specifically, triggering the ""<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight-or-flight_response"">fight-or-flight</a>""
or ""acute stress"" response to make their body release epinephrine
(adrenalin), the standard emergency treatment for anaphylaxis.


</p>

<p>

One question is whether their body would release enough epinephrine
that this would actually work.  Being stung by a bee when you know you
have a life-threatening allergy seems terrifying already, which
probably induces some amount of acute stress response, and that's
clearly not enough to stop anaphylaxis.  Perhaps the problem is that
the amount of epinephrine released in acute stress is just much lower
than what you get from an Epi-Pen?

</p>

<p>

I tried to look up numbers, and found <a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/wortsman1984.pdf"">Adrenomedullary response to maximal stress in
humans</a> (Wortsman 1984).  They looked at blood samples from fifteen
patients undergoing cardiac arrest, which is about as stressful as you
can get.  All were either not given external epinephrine, or their
blood was sampled before they were.  They measured a mean peak value
of 10.3 ± 2.9 ng/ml of epinephrine in the samples.  They also
wrote:

</p>

<blockquote>
Resuscitation after cardiac arrest is associated with
the highest endogenous epinephrine concentration ever
recorded: 35.6 ng/ml. This finding supports our a priori
assumption that the stress of cardiac arrest produces
maximal adrenomedullary stimulation.
</blockquote>



<p>

To compare to an auto-injector, I found <a href=""https://www.jacionline.org/article/S0091-6749(11)02197-X/pdf"">Epinephrine
0.3 mg Bioavailability Following a Single
Injection with a Novel Epinephrine Auto-injector, e-cue, in Healthy
Adults, with Reference to a Single Injection using EpiPen 0.3 mg</a>
(Edwards 2012) which compared the Epi-Pen to the Auvi-Q (then called
e-cue).  They found a mean peak blood epinephrine concentration of 0.52
ng/ml with the Epi-Pen and 0.49 ng/ml with the Auvi-Q.

</p>

<p>

Those levels are about 20x lower than the ones measured during cardiac
arrest, which tells us that the body is capable of releasing
sufficient epinephrine to handle anaphylaxis.

</p>

<p>

The main remaining questions are (a) can someone reliably induce an
acute stress response in a friend and if so how? and (b) does
friend-induced response cause the body to release sufficient
epinephrine?

</p>

<p>

Overall this sounds plausible, and I'm very curious what someone who
knows more about this than I do would think.

<p>My earlier post <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/2Z8pMDfDduAwtwpcX/three-stories-for-how-agi-comes-before-fai"">Three Stories for How AGI Comes Before FAI</a>, was an ""AI research strategy"" post.  ""AI research strategy"" is not the same as ""AI strategy research"".  ""AI research strategy"" relates to the Hamming question for technical AI alignment researchers: What are the most important questions in technical AI alignment and why aren't you trying to answer them?</p>
<p>Here's a different way of looking at these questions (which hopefully has a different set of flaws).</p>
<p>Suppose we had a matrix where each column corresponds to an AI safety problem and each row corresponds to a proposed safety measure.  Each cell contains an estimate of the probability of that safety measure successfully addressing that problem.  If we assume measure successes are independent, we could estimate the probability that any given problem gets solved if we build an AGI which applies all known safety measures.  If we assume problem successes are independent, we could estimate the probability that all known problems will be solved.</p>
<p>What about unknown problems?  Suppose that God has a list of all AI safety problems.  Suppose every time an AI alignment researcher goes out to lunch, there's some probability that they'll think of an AI safety problem chosen uniformly at random from God's list.  In that case, if we know the number of AI alignment researchers who go out to lunch on any given day, and we also know the date on which any given AI safety problem was first discovered, then this is essentially a card collection process which lets us estimate the length of God's list as an unknown parameter (say, using maximum likelihood on the intervals between discovery times, or you could construct a prior based on the number of distinct safety problems in other engineering fields).  In lay terms, if no one has proposed any new AI safety problems recently, it's plausible there aren't that many problems left.</p>
<p>How to estimate the probability that unknown problems will be successfully dealt with?  Suppose known problems are representative of the entire distribution of problems.  Then we can estimate the probability that an unknown problem will be successfully dealt with as follows: For each known problem, cover up rows corresponding to the safety measures inspired by that problem, then compute its new probability of success.  That gives you a distribution of success probabilities for ""unknown"" problems.  Assume success probabilities for actually-unknown problems are sampled from that distribution.  Then you could compute the probability of any given actually-unknown probability being solved by computing the expected value of that distribution.  Which also lets you compute the probability that your AGI will solve all the unknown problems too (assuming problem probabilities are independent).</p>
<p>What could this be useful for?  Doing this kind of analysis could help us know whether it's more valuable to discover more problems or discover more safety measures on the current margin.  It could tell us which problems are undersolved and would benefit from more people attacking them.  Even without doing the analysis, you can see that trying to solve multiple problems with the same measure could be a good idea, since those measures are more likely to generalize to unknown problems.  If overall success odds aren't looking good, we could make our first AI some kind of heavily restricted tool AI which tries to augment the matrix with additional rows and columns.  If success odds <em>are</em> looking good, we could compare success odds with background odds of x-risk and try to figure out whether to actually turn this thing on.</p>
<p>Obviously there are many simplifying assumptions being made with this kind of ""napkin math"".  For example, it could be that the implementation of safety measure A interacts negatively with the implementation of safety measure B and reverses its effect.  It could be that we aren't sampling from God's list uniformly at random and some problems are harder to think of than others.  Whether this project is actually worth doing is an ""AI research strategy strategy"" question, and thus above my pay grade.  If it's possible to generate the matrix automatically using natural language processing on a corpus including e.g. the AI Alignment Forum, I guess that makes the project look more attractive.</p>

Anki is hard, free and effective. Duolingo is easy, commercial and ineffective.</p>
<p>The number of Duolingo users far outstrips the number of Anki users. Duolingo has 8 million downloads on the Play Store. Anki has 40 thousand. So there are 200 Duolingo users for every Anki user<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-SXmbxMz9Qns6bSiKY-1"" id=""fnref-SXmbxMz9Qns6bSiKY-1"">[1]</a></sup>. If you ask a random language learner what software to use they'll probably suggest Duolingo. If you ask a random <em>successful</em> language learner what software to use they'll probably suggest Anki. Most language learners are unsuccessful.</p>
<p>It should be no surprise that most language learners use an ineffective product. Learning a language is hard. Duolingo is designed to attract as many customers as it can. Therefore Duolingo must be easy to use. Anki is designed to work. Therefore Anki must be hard to use<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-SXmbxMz9Qns6bSiKY-2"" id=""fnref-SXmbxMz9Qns6bSiKY-2"">[2]</a></sup>. Effectiveness and mass-adoption are mutually exclusive.</p>
<p>On average, you'll have to ask 200 language learners what software they use before one of them tells you about Anki. In practice, you are unlikely to stumble across Anki at all. <strong>You can only find out about Anki if you go looking for it and you'll only go looking for it if you already know it exists.</strong></p>
<p>No one ever told me about most of the software I use. Usually I'll infer that it must exist and then go looking for it. This is how I discovered qutebrowser, Spacemacs, tmux, i3 and—of course—Anki.</p>
<p>This principle isn't limited to open source software. Everything I've ever taken seriously exhibits a similar pattern. There's a common way most people do it and there's a cheaper, better, skill-intensive way a tiny minority do it.</p>
<p>Minority opinions are inherently controversial. Here are a few (relatively) uncontroversal examples to illustrate the trend:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vim keybindings vs. conventional hotkeys</li>
<li>Lisps vs. programming languages without syntactic macros</li>
<li>Good history books vs. the news</li>
<li>Powerlifting vs. popular exercise <em>de jour</em></li>
<li>Tiling window managers vs. the desktop metaphor</li>
</ul>
<p>If you disagree with one of the examples above that's okay but I <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/3xKXGh9RXaYTYZYgZ/p/vEGqDWDTnZ82eXo3J"">won't reply</a> to you in the comments.</p>
<p>I don't mind choosing to be part of the majority. I watch mainstream movies. I eat at popular restaurants. I perform the oldest magic tricks in the book. I'm okay with these choices I know about.</p>
<p>I make most of my choices unknowingly, by default, from the options presented to me. <strong>Most of the time I pick Duolingo over Anki without ever knowing I've made a choice.</strong></p>

LaCmtokFj9tF4itrK,Anti-counterfeiting Ink - an alternative way of combating oil theft?,anti-counterfeiting-ink-an-alternative-way-of-combating-oil,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/LaCmtokFj9tF4itrK/anti-counterfeiting-ink-an-alternative-way-of-combating-oil,2019-10-19T23:04:59.069Z,1,7,4,False,False,,"<p>In recent years, oil theft from pipelines has escalated in Mexico - $7.4 billion in fuel have been stolen since 2016. Pipeline tapping has increased from 211 occurrences in 2006 to over 7000 times in 2016. The cartels seem to have gotten involved as a means to diversify away from narcotics sale. The government has responded with heavy-handed crackdown, deploying federal security forces to patrol frequently tapped pipeline sections, arresting corrupt Pemex employees and even going as far as shutting down entire pipelines and resorting to tanker trucks and trains instead.</p><p>The last measure in particular has resulted in gas shortages and panic buying in the states the pipelines traversed, ironically increasing the incentive for oil thieves - a situation not too dissimilar to the war on drugs. This ultimately culminated in an explosive incident that killed over 130 people, most of which locals trying to gather free gas from a pipeline puncture. (It also doesn&apos;t bode well for tanker truck drivers as they&apos;re the next target)</p><p>I&apos;ve been thinking of an alternative solution: Suppose you have two chemical compounds A and B, the exact formula of which you keep secret. You add a certain concentration (1mg/L, let&apos;s say) of compound A at the source, and add compound B at the sink upon arrival (also 1mg/L for simplicity). The police can then easily identify oil stolen from the pipeline which only contains compound A (the reason for using 2 compounds instead of 1 is that we still want to allow the sale of oil from other legal sources that don&apos;t include either compound, e.g. imports).</p><p>This solution is similar to anti-counterfeit ink used in banknotes (or digital signatures, if you like). The compounds must be easy to detect (verify) but very hard to produce (duplicate). If the criminals get a hold of compound B, they can counterfeit stolen oil; if they get a hold of compound A, they can sabotage the system by spiking legal oil with it.</p><p>But guarding a small amount of secret compounds should be far easier than guarding the bulk material being transported over thousand of kilometers. After all, banknote printing facilities do it all the time with their anti-counterfeiting ink and pharmaceutical companies do it with otherwise illicit opioids. The security risk has been funneled through a narrow corridor.</p><p>Of course, these compounds must also be hard to separate from the oil, but not in the absolute sense: Since oil is relatively low value per kg, it only needs to be economically unviable to do the distillation on a small scale (large-scale operations are easy to spot and shut down by the government), similar to ethanol in lighter fluids.</p><p>Currently, stolen oil is sold both to gas stations and on the side of the road at a discount by thieves. We could start with monitoring gas stations by handing out detectors for compound A and B to inspectors. Gas stations whose gas doesn&apos;t show a 1:1 ratio of the compounds must have been at least partially supplied by illegal sources. We can even calculate how much exactly of the oil was illegal and tax/fine them accordingly.</p><p>This doesn&apos;t require a corruption-free police staff; as long as some of the inspectors are doing their job honestly there will be a disincentive for selling illegal oil. If a police inspector is afraid of being targeted by the cartels (as is often the case in Mexico), he could even install the detector in his car&apos;s gas tank and camouflage himself as a regular customer.</p><p>The enforcement can be expanded to include gas tank spot checks of passing cars on highways / at toll stations. Heck, as long as detectors are cheap to make and impossible to reverse-engineer to crack the compound formula, just distribute them among regular drivers so they can check for themselves (the &quot;quality&quot; of the gas they&apos;re buying).</p><p>Is there a glaring flaw with this proposal? Has it (or something similar) ever been implemented anywhere?

He used the iid assumption as a critical part of his story. Initially, I thought that this was a good description of what was going on; but I soon realized that iid isn't myopia at all (and commented as such). This post expands on the thought.</p><p>My original post conflated <em>episodic</em> (which is basically 'iid') with <em>myopic</em>.</p><p>In an episodic setting, it makes sense to be myopic about anything beyond the current episode. There's no benefit to cross-episode strategies, so, no need to learn them.</p><p>This is true at several levels (which I mention in the hopes of avoiding later confusion):</p><ul><li>In designing an ML algorithm, if we are assuming an episodic structure, it makes sense to use a learning algorithm which is designed to be myopic.</li><li>A learning algorithm in an episodic setting has no incentive to find non-myopic solutions (even if it can).</li></ul><p>However, it is also possible to consider myopia in the absence of episodic structure, and not just as a mistake. We might <em>want</em> an ML algorithm to learn myopic strategies, as is the case with predictive systems. (We don't want them to <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/25288usP5B5ytnzA4/random-thoughts-on-predict-o-matic"">learn to manipulate the data</a>; and even though that failure mode is far-fetched for most modern systems, there's no point setting up learning procedures which would incentivise it. Indeed, <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4hdHto3uHejhY2F3Q/partial-agency"">learning procedures seem to mostly encourage myopia</a>, though the full situation is still unclear to me.)</p><p>These myopic strategies aren't just ""strategies which behave <em>as if</em> there were an episodic assumption"", either. For example, sequential prediction is myopic (the goal is to predict each next item accurately, <em>not</em> to get the most accuracy overall -- if this is unclear, hopefully it will become clearer in the next section).</p><p>So, there's a distinction between <em><strong>not remembering the past</strong></em> vs <em><strong>not looking ahead to the future</strong></em>. In episodic settings, the relevant parts of past and future are both limited to the duration of the episode. However, the two come apart in general. We can have/want myopic agents with memory; or, we can have/want memoryless agents which are not myopic. (The second seems somewhat more exotic.)</p><h1>Game-Theoretic Myopia Definition</h1><p>So far, I've used 'myopia' in more or less two ways: an inclusive notion which encompasses <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4hdHto3uHejhY2F3Q/partial-agency"">a big cluster of things</a>, and also the specific thing of only optimizing each output to maximize the very next reward. Let's call the more specific thing ""absolute"" myopia, and try to define the more general thing.</p><p>Myopia can't be defined in terms of optimizing an objective in the usual sense -- there isn't one quantity being optimized. However, it seems like most things in my 'myopia' cluster <em>can</em> be described in terms of game theory.</p><p>Let's put down some definitions:</p><p><em><strong>Sequential decision scenario:</strong></em> An interactive environment which takes in actions and outputs rewards and observations. I'm not trying to deal with embeddedness issues; this is basically the AIXI setup. (I do think 'reward' is a very restrictive assumption about what kind of feedback the system gets, but talking about other alternatives seems like a distraction from the current post.)</p><p><em><strong>(Generalized) objective:</strong></em> A generalized objective assigns, to each action <span><style>.mjx-chtml {display: inline-block; line-height: 0; text-indent: 0; text-align: left; text-transform: none; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 100%; font-size-adjust: none; letter-spacing: normal; word-wrap: normal; word-spacing: normal; white-space: nowrap; float: none; direction: ltr; max-width: none; max-height: none; min-width: 0; min-height: 0; border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 1px 0}

Or, putting it another way: the problem is that we have to <em>learn</em>; so <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/brXr7PJ2W4Na2EW2q/the-commitment-races-problem"">we can't talk about everything being in equilibrium from the beginning</a>.</p><p> Perhaps we can say that there should be some <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""n""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">n</span></span></span></span></span></span>  such that each decision <em>after that</em> is in approximate equilibrium with each other <em>taking the decisions before as given</em>.</p><p>(Aside -- What we definitely don't want (if we want to describe or engineer legitimately myopic behavior) is a framework where the different decision-points end up bargaining with each other (acausal trade, or mere causal trade), in order to take pareto improvements and thus move toward full agency. IE, in order to keep our distinctions from falling apart, we can't apply a decision theory which would cooperate in Prisoner's Dilemma or similar things. This could present difficulties.)</p><p>Let's move on to a different way of thinking about myopia, through the language of Pareto-optimality.</p><h1>Pareto Definition</h1><p>We can think of myopia as a refusal to take certain Pareto improvements. This fits well with the previous definition; if an agent takes all the Pareto improvements, then its behavior <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/sZuw6SGfmZHvcAAEP/complete-class-consequentialist-foundations"">must be consistent with some global weights</a> <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""f(i)""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.519em; padding-right: 0.06em;"">f</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">(</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">i</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">)</span></span></span></span></span></span> not a function of <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""n""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">n</span></span></span></span></span></span>. However, not all myopic strategies in the Pareto sense have nice representations in terms of generalized objectives.</p><p>In particular: I mentioned that generalized objectives couldn't rule out manipulation through selection of self-fulfulling prophecies; so, only capture part of what seems implied by map/territory directionality. Thinking in terms of Pareto-failures, we can also talk about failing to reap the gains from selection of manipulative self-fulfilling prophecies.</p><p>However, thinking in these terms is not very satisfying. It allows a very broad notion of myopia, but has few other virtues. Generalized objectives let me talk about myopic agents <em>trying to do a specific thing, </em>even though the thing they're trying to do isn't a coherent objective. Defining myopia as failure to take certain Pareto improvements doesn't give me any structure like that; a myopic agent is being defined in the negative, rather than described positively.</p><p>Here, as before, we also have the problem of defining things learning-theoretically. Speaking purely in terms of whether the agent takes certain Pareto improvements doesn't really make sense, because it has to learn what situation it is in. We want to talk about learning processes, so we need to talk about learning to take the Pareto improvements, somehow.</p><p>(Bayesian learning can be described in terms of Pareto optimality directly, because using a prior over possible environments allows Pareto-optimal behavior in terms of those environments. However, working that way requires <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/efWfvrWLgJmbBAs3m/embedded-world-models"">realizability</a>, which isn't realistic.)</p><h1>Decision Theory</h1><p>In the original partial agency post, I described full agency as an extreme (perhaps imaginary) limit of less and less myopia. Full agency is like Cartesian dualism, sitting fully outside the universe and optimizing.</p><p>Is full agency that difficult? From the generalized-objective formalism, one might think that ordinary RL with exponential discounting is sufficient.</p><p>The counterexamples to this are MIRI-esque decision problems, which create dynamic inconsistencies for otherwise non-myopic agents. (See <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/S3W4Xrmp6AL7nxRHd/formalising-decision-theory-is-hard#Xiz3TAe2Z9Yh49S9X"">this comment thread with Vanessa</a> for more discussion of several of the points I'm about to make.)</p><p>To give a simple example, the version of Newcomb's Problem where the predictor knows about as much about your behavior as you do. (The version where the predictor is nearly infallible is easily handled by RL-like learning; you need to specifically inject sophisticated CDT-like thinking to mess that one up.)</p><p>In order to have good learning-theoretic properties at all, we need to have epsilon exploration. But if we do, then we tend to learn to 1-box, because (it will seem) doing so is independent of the predictor's predictions of us.</p><p>Now, it's true that in a sequential setting, there will be some incentive to 2-box not for the payoff today, but for the future; establishing a reputation of 1-boxing gets higher payoffs in iterated Newcomb in a straightforward (causal) way.</p><p>However, that's not enough to entirely avoid dynamic inconsistency. For any discounting function, we need only to assume that the instances of Newcomb's problem are spaced out far enough over time so that 2-boxing in each individual case is appealing.</p><p>Now, <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/S3W4Xrmp6AL7nxRHd/formalising-decision-theory-is-hard#H45aYhMFED4Byr72m"">one might argue</a> that in this case, the agent is correctly respecting its generalized objective; it's supposed to sacrifice future value for present according to the discounting function. And that's true, if we want myopic behavior. But it is dynamically inconsistent -- the agent wishes to 2-box in each individual case, but with respect to future cases, would prefer to 1-box. It would happily bind its future actions given an opportunity to do so.</p><p>Like the issue with self-fulfilling prophecies, this creates a type of myopia which we can't really talk about within the formalism of generalized objectives. Even with an apparently dynamically consistent discounting function, the agent is inconsistent. As mentioned earlier, we <em>need</em> generalized-objective systems to fail to coordinate with themselves; otherwise, their goals collapse into regular objectives. So this is a type of myopia which <em>all</em> generalized objectives possess.</p><p>As before, I'd really prefer to be able to talk about this with <em>specific types </em>of myopia (as with myopic generalized objectives), rather than just pointing to a dynamic inconsistency and classifying it with myopia.</p><p>(We might think of the fully non-myopic agent as the limit of less and less discounting, as Vanessa suggests. This has some problems of convergence, but perhaps that's in line with non-myopia being an extreme ideal which doesn't always make sense. Alternately, we might thing of this as a problem of decision theory, arguing that we should be able reap the advantages of 1-boxing despite our values temporally discounting. Or, there might be some other wilder generalization of objective functions which lets us represent the distinctions we care about.)</p><h1>Mechanism Design Analogy</h1><p>I'll close this post with a sketchy conjecture.</p><p>Although I don't want to think of generalized objectives as truly multi-agent in the one-'agent'-per-decision sense, learning algorithms will typically have a space of possible hypotheses which are (in some sense) competing with each other. We can analogize <em>that</em> to many competing agents (keeping in mind that they may individually be 'partial agents', ie, we can't necessarily model them as coherently pursuing a utility function).</p><p>For any particular type of myopia (whether or not we can capture it in terms of a generalized objective), we can ask the question: is it possible to design a training procedure which will learn that type of myopia?</p><p>(We can approach this question in different ways; asymptotic convergence, bounded-loss (which may give useful bounds at finite time), or 'in-practice' (which fully accounts for finite-time effects). As I've mentioned before, my thoughts on this are mostly asymptotic at the moment, that being the easier theoretical question.)</p><p>We can think of this question -- the question of designing training procedures -- as a mechanism-design question. Is it possible to set up a system of incentives which encourages a given kind of behavior?</p><p>Now, mechanism design is a field which is associated with negative results. It is often not possible to get everything you want. As such, a natural conjecture might be:</p><p><strong>Conjecture:</strong> <em>It is not possible to set up a learning system which gets you full agency in the sense of eventually learning to take all the Pareto improvements</em>.</p><p>This conjecture is still quite vague, because I have not stated what it means to 'learn to take all the Pareto improvements'. Additionally, I don't really want to assume the AIXI-like setting which I've sketched in this post. The setting <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5bd75cc58225bf0670375575/the-learning-theoretic-ai-alignment-research-agenda"">doesn't yield very good learning-theoretic results anyway</a>, so getting a negative result here isn't that interesting. Ideally the conjecture should be formulated in a setting where we can contrast it to some positive results.</p><p>There's also reason to suspect the conjecture to be false. There's a natural instrumental convergence toward dynamic consistency; a system will self-modify to greater consistency in many cases. If there's an attractor basin around full agency, one would not expect it to be <em>that</em> hard to set up incentives which push things into that attractor basin.</p>",abramdemski,abramdemski,abramdemski,

<p>The second program is called Audience. As input, it accepts the output of Reporter. As output, it returns a probability distribution.</p>

<p>We can model drawing a sample from this distribution using this function in the <a href=""https://www.python.org/"">Python programming language</a>:</p>
<pre><code>import random

def x():
    r = random.random()
    if 0 &lt;= r &lt; 1/2:
        return 1
    elif 1/2 &lt;= r &lt; 3/4:
        return 2
    elif 3/4 &lt;= r &lt; 15/16:
        return 3
    else:
        return 4
</code></pre>
<p>For compatibility, we can imagine that Reporter and Audience are also written in Python. This is just for demonstration in the blog post that I'm writing—the <em>real</em> Reporter and Audience (out there in the world I'm asking you to imagine) might be much more complicated programs written for some kind of <em>alien</em> computer the likes of which we have not yet dreamt! But I like Python, and for the moment, we can pretend.</p>
<p>So pretend that Audience looks like this (where the dictionary, or hashmap, that gets returned represents a probability distribution, with the keys being random-variable outcomes and the values being probabilities):</p>
<pre><code>from collections import Counter

def audience(report):
    a = Counter()
    for sight in report:
        for possibility in sight:
            a[possibility] += 1/len(sight)            
    d = sum(a_j - len(a) for a_j in a.values())
    return {x: (a_i - 1)/d for x, a_i in a.items()}
</code></pre>
<p>Let's consider multiple possibilities for the form that Reporter could take. A particularly simple implementation of Reporter (call it <code>reporter_0</code>) might look like this:</p>
<pre><code>def reporter_0(xs):
    output = []
    for x in xs:
        output.append({x})
    return output
</code></pre>
<p>The pairing of <code>audience</code> and <code>reporter_0</code> has a <em>Very Interesting Property!</em> When we call our Audience on the output of this Reporter, the probability distribution that Audience returns is <em>very similar</em> to the distribution that our random variables are from!<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-D8BqfPzGizQ38Xcmu-1"" id=""fnref-D8BqfPzGizQ38Xcmu-1"">[1]</a></sup></p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; audience(reporter_0([x() for _ in range(100000)]))
{1: 0.5003300528084493, 2: 0.2502900464074252, 3: 0.1873799807969275, 4: 0.062119939190270444}

# Compare to P(X) expressed as a Python dictionary—
&gt;&gt;&gt; {1: 1/2, 2: 1/4, 3: 3/16, 4: 1/16}
{1: 0.5, 2: 0.25, 3: 0.1875, 4: 0.0625}
</code></pre>
<p>Weird, right?!</p>
<p>Of course, there are <em>other</em> possible implementations of Reporter. For example, this choice of Reporter (<code>reporter_1</code>) does <em>not</em> result in the Very Interesting Property—</p>
<pre><code>def reporter_1(xs):
    output = []
    for _ in range(len(xs)):
        output.append({4})
    return output
</code></pre>
<p>It instead induces Audience to output a very different (and rather boring) distribution. It doesn't even matter how the <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""X_i""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base"" style=""margin-right: -0.024em;""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.024em;"">X</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mi"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">i</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> turned up; the result will always be the same:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; audience(reporter_1([x() for _ in range(100000)]))
{4: 1.0}
</code></pre>
<p>We could go on imagining other versions of Reporter, like this one (<code>reporter_2</code>)—</p>
<pre><code>def reporter_2(xs):
    output = []
    for x in xs:
        if x == 4 or random.random() &lt; 0.2:
            output.append({x})
        else:
            continue
    return output
</code></pre>
<p>While the distribution that <code>reporter_2</code> makes Audience output isn't as boring as the one we saw for <code>reporter_1</code>, it still doesn't result in the Very Interesting Property of matching the distribution of the <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""X_i""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base"" style=""margin-right: -0.024em;""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.024em;"">X</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mi"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">i</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>. It comes <em>closer</em> than <code>reporter_1</code> did—notice how the <em>ratios</em> of probabilities assigned to the first three outcomes is similar to that of the original distribution—but it's assigning way too much probability-mass to the outcome ""4"":</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; audience(reporter_2([x() for _ in range(100000)]))
{1: 0.3971289947471831, 2: 0.20309555314968522, 3: 0.14860259032038173, 4: 0.2516540358474678}
</code></pre>
<p>So far, all of the Reporters we've imagined are still only putting one element in the inner sets of the list-of-sets that they return. But we could imagine <code>reporter_3</code>—</p>
<pre><code>def reporter_3(xs):
    output = []
    for x in xs:
        if x == 1 or x == 4:
            output.append({1, 4})
        else:
            output.append({x})
    return output
</code></pre>
<p>Unlike <code>reporter_2</code> (which typically returned a list with <em>fewer</em> elements than it received as input), the list returned by <code>reporter_3</code> has exactly as many elements as the list it took in. Yet this Reporter still prompts Audience to return a distribution with too many ""4""s—and <em>unlike</em> <code>reporter_2</code>, it doesn't even get the ratio of the other outcomes right, yielding disproportionately fewer ""1""s compared to ""2""s and ""3""s than the original distribution—</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; audience(reporter_3([x() for _ in range(100000)]))
{1: 0.2808949431909106, 2: 0.24795967354776766, 3: 0.19037045927348376, 4: 0.2808949431909106}
</code></pre>
<p>Again, I've presented Audience and various possible Reporters as simple Python programs for illustration and simplicity, but the same <em>input-output relationships</em> could be embodied as part of a more complicated system—perhaps an entire conscious mind which could talk.</p>
<p>So now imagine our Audience as a <em>person</em> with her own hopes and fears and ambitions ... ambitions whose ultimate fulfillment will require dedication, bravery—and meticulously careful planning based on an accurate estimate of <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""P(X)""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.109em;"">P</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">(</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.024em;"">X</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">)</span></span></span></span></span></span>, with almost no room for error.</p>
<p>So, too, imagine each of our possible Reporters as a person: loyal, responsible—and, entirely coincidentally, the supplier of a good that Audience's careful plans call for in proportion to the value of <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""P(X = 4)""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.109em;"">P</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">(</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.024em;"">X</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.077em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">=</span></span><span class=""mjx-mn MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">4</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">)</span></span></span></span></span></span>.</p>
<p>When the expected frequency of ""4""s fails to appear, Audience's lifework is in ruins. All of her training, all of her carefully calibrated plans, all the interminable hours of hard labor, were for nothing. She confronts Reporter in a furor of rage and grief.</p>
<p>""You <em>lied</em>,"" she says through tears of betrayal, ""I <em>trusted you</em> and <em>you lied to me!</em>""</p>
<p>The Reporter whose behavior corresponds to <code>reporter_2</code> replies, ""How <em>dare</em> you accuse me of lying?!

<p>The same methodology that was essential for studying truthseeking, is equally essential for studying the propagation of falsehood. If true ""beliefs"" are models that <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/a7n8GdKiAZRX86T5A/making-beliefs-pay-rent-in-anticipated-experiences"">make accurate predictions</a>, then <em>deception</em> would presumably be communication that systematically results in <em>less</em> accurate predictions (by a listener applying the same inference algorithms that would result in more accurate predictions when applied to direct observations or ""honest"" reports).</p>
<p>In a peaceful world where most falsehood was due to random mistakes, there would be little to be gained by studying processes that systematically create erroneous maps.

Several friends are collecting signatures to put 

<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting"">Instant-runoff
Voting</a>, branded as Ranked Choice Voting, on the ballot in
Massachusetts (

<a href=""https://ballotpedia.org/Massachusetts_Ranked-Choice_Voting_Initiative_(2020)"">Ballotpedia</a>,


<a href=""https://www.mass.gov/files/documents/2019/08/07/19-10.pdf"">full
text</a>).  I'm glad that an attempt to try a different voting method
is getting traction, but I'm frustrated that they've chosen
IRV.  While every voting method has downsides, IRV is substantially
worse than some other decent options.



</p><p>

Imagine that somehow the 2016 presidential election had been between
Trump, Clinton, and Kasich, and preferences had looked like:

</p>

<ul>
<li>35% of people: Trump, Kasich, Clinton</li>
<li>14% of people: Kasich, Trump, Clinton</li>
<li>17% of people: Kasich, Clinton, Trump</li>
<li>34% of people: Clinton, Kasich, Trump</li>
</ul>

(This is very hypothetical; Kasich wasn't this popular.)



<p>

In a traditional election we'd have 35% for Trump, 34% for Clinton,
31% for Kasich, and declare Trump the winner.  Under IRV we would
eliminate the last-place candidate, Kasich, and divide their votes
based on who was put down in second place:

</p>

<ul>
<li>49% of people: Trump, Clinton</li>
<li>51% of people: Clinton, Trump</li>
</ul>

Since Clinton has passed 50% we declare her the winner.



<p>

But let's take a look at how people would have voted in one-on-one
elections:

</p>

<ul>
<li>Trump vs Kasich: Kasich wins 65% to 35%</li>
<li>Clinton vs Kasich: Kasich wins 66% to 34%</li>
<li>Trump vs Clinton: Clinton wins 51% to 49%</li>
</ul>

About 2/3 of people prefer Kasich to any other candidate on offer, but
he doesn't win with a traditional election, and he also doesn't win
with IRV.  This election has a ""

<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_criterion"">Condorcet
winner</a>"", someone who would win a one-on-one election against
every other candidate, and IRV isn't designed in a way that it will
always choose that person. [1]



<p>

Additionally, some proponents of IRV will say that voting your true
preferences will never hurt you: that under IRV you never need to hold
your nose and put someone first when really you prefer someone else.
But there are cases where you can get an outcome you like more by
putting a higher ranking on a candidate you like less.  Consider an
election like:

</p>

<p>

</p>

<ul>
<li>32% of people: Clinton, Sanders, Trump</li>
<li>33% of people: Sanders, Trump, Clinton</li>
<li>35% of people: Trump, Clinton, Sanders</li>
</ul>



<p>

Now, this is a terrible election and there's no clear winner because
people's <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_paradox"">preferences
point around in a circle</a>.  Under traditional voting Trump wins,
while under IRV Clinton is eliminated and Sanders wins.  But if a few
people preferring Trump &gt; Clinton &gt; Sanders had instead voted
just Clinton &gt; Trump &gt; Sanders we could have had:

</p>

<p>

</p>

<ul>
<li>32% of people: Clinton, Sanders, Trump</li>
<li>33% of people: Sanders, Trump, Clinton</li>
<li>32% of people: Trump, Clinton, Sanders</li>
<li>3% of people: Clinton, Trump, Sanders</li>
</ul>



<p>

Then Trump would have been eliminated first, with only 32% of the
first place votes, and his second place votes would have gone to
Clinton, making her win.  So by voting for a candidate they liked
less, these voters got an outcome they liked more.  Staying home and
not voting would similarly have helped them.

</p>

<p>

I do want to be clear: no voting system handles situations like this
well, and all reasonable voting systems have situations where you can
come out ahead by voting in a way that doesn't reflect your true
preferences.  But ""IRV means you can always vote your heart"" isn't
true.

</p>

<p>

So what do I think we should do?  Since every voting system has <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow%27s_impossibility_theorem"">downsides</a>
it's not enough to say that a voting system is flawed and so we
shouldn't use it.  But at the same time some voting systems are still
better than others.

</p>

<p>

For example, a clear improvement over IRV would be to say that if at
any point there's a candidate who would win a one-on-one election
against every other candidate (a Condorcet winner) then that candidate
should win.  While it does make IRV a little bit more complicated, it
means IRV will no longer eliminate candidates who are the closest
there is to a consensus choice.  This is called Condorcet-IRV or <a href=""https://rangevoting.org/SmithIRV.html"">WoodSIRV</a>, and turns
IRV into a voting method that I would be very strongly in favor of.

</p>

<p>

(I think <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approval_voting"">approval
voting</a> is probably a better choice, but it would be good to see
more examples of it in practice in competitive elections first.)

</p>

<p>
<br />

[1] A bit of historical irony: in 2008 Greg Dennis, an IRV supporter,
wrote in <a href=""http://archive3.fairvote.org/articles/why-i-prefer-irv-to-condorcet/"">Why
I Prefer IRV to Condorcet</a>:

</p>

<blockquote>
In this scenario, the presence of a candidate with strong core support
causes a Condorcet winner with little core support to
lose. Fortunately, despite the theoretical possibility of this
scenario, the empirical evidence suggests that it is vanishingly rare
in practice. In fact, if you look at the ballot data that is publicly
available for the IRV elections held in the US (San Francisco, CA,
Burlington, VT, and Pierce County, WA), for instance, you'll see that
IRV and Condorcet agree on the winner every single time.
</blockquote>

This was at a time when IRV had been used for only a few elections.
The very next Burlington VT election, 

<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_Burlington_mayoral_election"">in
2009</a>, ran into exactly this situation.  This led to enough
controversy that Burlington repealed IRV in 2010.

If you are not familiar with AI safety, <strong>note that I am skipping many arguments and counterarguments in the book that are aimed for you</strong>. I&apos;ll refer to the book as &quot;HC&quot; in this newsletter.</em></p><p>Before we get into details of impacts and solutions to the problem of AI safety, it&apos;s important to have a model of how AI development will happen. Many estimates have been made by figuring out the amount of compute needed to run a human brain, and figuring out how long it will be until we get there. HC doesn&apos;t agree with these; it suggests the bottleneck for AI is in the algorithms rather than the hardware. We will need several conceptual breakthroughs, for example in language or common sense understanding, cumulative learning (the analog of cultural accumulation for humans), discovering hierarchy, and managing mental activity (that is, the metacognition needed to prioritize what to think about next). It&apos;s not clear how long these will take, and whether there will need to be more breakthroughs after these occur, but these seem like necessary ones.</p><p>What could happen if we do get beneficial superintelligent AI? While there is a lot of sci-fi speculation that we could do here, as a weak lower bound, it should at least be able to automate away almost all existing human labor. Assuming that superintelligent AI is very cheap, most services and many goods would become extremely cheap. Even many primary products such as food and natural resources would become cheaper, as human labor is still a significant fraction of their production cost. If we assume that this could bring up everyone&apos;s standard of life up to that of the 88th percentile American, that would result in nearly a <em>tenfold</em> increase in world GDP per year. Assuming a 5% discount rate per year, this corresponds to $13.5 <em>quadrillion</em> net present value. Such a giant prize removes many reasons for conflict, and should encourage everyone to cooperate to ensure we all get to keep this prize.</p><p>Of course, this doesn&apos;t mean that there aren&apos;t any problems, even with AI that does what its owner wants. Depending on who has access to powerful AI systems, we could see a rise in automated surveillance, lethal autonomous weapons, automated blackmail, fake news and behavior manipulation. Another issue that could come up is that once AI is better than humans at all tasks, we may end up delegating everything to AI, and lose autonomy, leading to <em>human enfeeblement</em>.</p><p>This all assumes that we are able to control AI. However, we should be cautious about such an endeavor -- if nothing else, we should be careful about creating entities that are more intelligent than us. After all, the gorillas probably aren&apos;t too happy about the fact that their habitat, happiness, and existence depends on our moods and whims. For this reason, HC calls this the <em>gorilla problem</em>: specifically, &quot;the problem of whether humans can maintain their supremacy and autonomy in a world that includes machines with substantially greater intelligence&quot;. Of course, we aren&apos;t in the same position as the gorillas: we get to <em>design</em> the more intelligent &quot;species&quot;. But we should probably have some good arguments explaining why our design isn&apos;t going to succumb to the gorilla problem. This is especially important in the case of a fast intelligence explosion, or <em>hard takeoff</em>, because in that scenario we do not get any time to react and solve any problems that arise.</p><p>Do we have such an argument right now? Not really, and in fact there&apos;s an argument that we <em>will</em> succumb to the gorilla problem. The vast majority of research in AI and related fields assumes that there is some definite, known <em>specification</em> or <em>objective</em> that must be optimized. In RL, we optimize the <em>reward function</em>; in search, we look for states matching a <em>goal criterion</em>; in statistics, we minimize <em>expected loss</em>; in control theory, we minimize the <em>cost function</em> (typically deviation from some desired behavior); in economics, we design mechanisms and policies to maximize the <em>utility</em> of individuals, <em>welfare</em> of groups, or <em>profit</em> of corporations. This leads HC to propose the following standard model of machine intelligence: <em>Machines are intelligent to the extent that their actions can be expected to achieve their objectives.</em> However, if we put in the wrong objective, the machine&apos;s obstinate pursuit of that objective would lead to outcomes we won&apos;t like.</p><p>Consider for example the content selection algorithms used by social media, typically maximizing some measure of engagement, like click-through. Despite their lack of intelligence, such algorithms end up changing the user&apos;s preference so that they become more predictable, since more predictable users can be given items they are more likely to click on. In practice, this means that users are pushed to become more extreme in their political views. Arguably, these algorithms have already caused much damage to the world.</p><p>So the problem is that we don&apos;t know how to put our objectives inside of the AI system so that when it optimizes its objective, the results are good for us. Stuart calls this the &quot;King Midas&quot; problem: as the legend goes, King Midas wished that everything he touched would turn to gold, not realizing that &quot;everything&quot; included his daughter and his food, a classic case of a <u><a href=""https://vkrakovna.wordpress.com/2018/04/02/specification-gaming-examples-in-ai/"">badly specified objective</a></u> (<u><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/ff6340049bd0/alignment-newsletter-1"">AN #1</a></u>). In some sense, we&apos;ve known about this problem for a long time, both from King Midas&apos;s tale, and in stories about genies, where the characters inevitably want to undo their wishes.</p><p>You might think that we could simply turn off the power to the AI, but that won&apos;t work, because for almost any definite goal, the AI has an incentive to stay operational, just because that is necessary for it to achieve its goal. This is captured in what may be Stuart&apos;s most famous quote: <em>you can&apos;t fetch the coffee if you&apos;re dead</em>. This is one of a few worrisome <u><a href=""https://selfawaresystems.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/ai_drives_final.pdf"">convergent instrumental subgoals</a></u>.</p><p>What went wrong? The problem was the way we evaluated machine intelligence, which doesn&apos;t take into account the fact that machines should be useful for <em>us</em>. HC proposes: <em>Machines are <strong>beneficial</strong> to the extent that <strong>their</strong> actions can be expected to achieve <strong>our</strong> objectives</em>. But with this definition, instead of our AI systems optimizing a definite, wrong objective, they will <em>also</em> be uncertain about the objective, since we ourselves don&apos;t know what our objectives are. HC expands on this by proposing three principles for the design of AI systems, that I&apos;ll quote here in full:</p><p>1. <em>The machine&#x2019;s only objective is to maximize the realization of human preferences.</em></p><p>2. <em>The machine is initially uncertain about what those preferences are.</em></p><p>3. <em>The ultimate source of information about human preferences is human behavior.</em></p><p><u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03137"">Cooperative Inverse Reinforcement Learning</a></u> provides a formal model of an <em>assistance game</em> that showcases these principles. You might worry that an AI system that is uncertain about its objective will not be as useful as one that knows the objective, but actually this uncertainty is a feature, not a bug: it leads to AI systems that are deferential, that ask for clarifying information, and that try to learn human preferences. <u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.08219"">The Off-Switch Game</a></u> shows that because the AI is uncertain about the reward, it will let itself be shut off. These papers are discussed later in this newsletter.</p><p>So that&apos;s the proposed solution. You might worry that the proposed solution is quite challenging: after all, it requires a shift in the entire way we do AI. What if the standard model of AI can deliver more results, even if just because more people work on it? Here, HC is optimistic: the big issue with the standard model is that it is not very good at learning our preferences, and there&apos;s a huge economic pressure to learn preferences. For example, I would pay a lot of money for an AI assistant that accurately learns my preferences for meeting times, and schedules them completely autonomously.</p><p>Another research challenge is how to actually put principle 3 into practice: it requires us to connect human behavior to human preferences. <u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.02827"">Inverse Reward Design</a></u> and <u><a href=""https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2019/02/11/learning_preferences/"">Preferences Implicit in the State of the World</a></u> (<u><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/35b451cb4d70/alignment-newsletter-45"">AN #45</a></u>) are example papers that tackle portions of this. However, there are <em>lots</em> of subtleties in this connection. We need to use <em>Gricean semantics</em> for language: when we say X, we do not mean the literal meaning of X: the agent must also take into account the fact that we bothered to say X, and that we didn&apos;t say Y. For example, I&apos;m only going to ask for the agent to buy a cup of coffee if I believe that there is a place to buy reasonably priced coffee nearby. If those beliefs happen to be wrong, the agent should ask for clarification, rather than trudge hundreds of miles or pay hundreds of dollars to ensure I get my cup of coffee.</p><p>Another problem with inferring preferences from behavior is that humans are nearly always in some deeply nested plan, and many actions don&apos;t even occur to us. Right now I&apos;m writing this summary, and not considering whether I should become a fireman. I&apos;m not writing this summary because I just ran a calculation showing that this would best achieve my preferences, I&apos;m doing it because it&apos;s a subpart of the overall plan of writing this bonus newsletter, which itself is a subpart of other plans. The connection to my preferences is very far up. How do we deal with that fact?</p><p>There are perhaps more fundamental challenges with the notion of &quot;preferences&quot; itself. For example, our <em>experiencing self</em> and our <em>remembering self</em> may have different preferences -- if so, which one should our agent optimize for? In addition, our preferences often change over time: should our agent optimize for our current preferences, even if it knows that they will predictably change in the future? This one could potentially be solved by learning <em>meta-preferences</em> that dictate what kinds of preference change processes are acceptable.</p><p>All of these issues suggest that we need work across many fields (such as AI, cognitive science, psychology, and neuroscience) to reverse-engineer human cognition, so that we can put principle 3 into action and create a model that shows how human behavior arises from human preferences.</p><p>So far, we&apos;ve been talking about the case with a single human. But of course, there are going to be multiple humans: how do we deal with that? As a baseline, we could imagine that every human gets their own agent that optimizes for their preferences. However, this will differentially benefit people who care less about other people&apos;s welfare, since their agents have access to many potential plans that wouldn&apos;t be available to an agent for someone who cared about other people. For example, if Harriet was going to be late for a meeting with Ivan, her AI agent might arrange for Ivan to be even later.</p><p>What if we had laws that prevented AI systems from acting in such antisocial ways? It seems likely that superintelligent AI would be able to find loopholes in such laws, so that they do things that are strictly legal but still antisocial, e.g. line-cutting. (This problem is similar to the problem that we can&apos;t just write down what we want and have AI optimize it.)</p><p>What if we made our AI systems utilitarian (assuming we figured out some acceptable method of comparing utilities across people)? Then we get the &quot;Somalia problem&quot;: agents will end up going to Somalia to help the worse-off people there, and so no one would ever buy such an agent.</p><p>Overall, it&apos;s not obvious how we deal with the transition from a single human to multiple humans. While HC focuses on a potential solution for the single human / single agent case, there is still much more to be said and done to account for the impact of AI on all of humanity. To quote HC, &quot;There is really no analog in our present world to the relationship we will have with beneficial intelligent machines in the future. It remains to be seen how the endgame turns out.&quot;</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> I enjoyed reading this book; I don&apos;t usually get to read a single person&apos;s overall high-level view on the state of AI, how it could have societal impact, the argument for AI risk, potential solutions, and the need for AI governance. It&apos;s nice to see all of these areas I think about tied together into a single coherent view. While I agree with much of the book, especially the conceptual switch from the standard model of intelligent machines to Stuart&apos;s model of beneficial machines, I&apos;m going to focus on disagreements in this opinion.</p><p>First, the book has an implied stance towards the future of AI research that I don&apos;t agree with: I could imagine that powerful AI systems end up being created by learning alone without needing the conceptual breakthroughs that Stuart outlines. This has been proposed in e.g. <u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10985"">AI-GAs</a></u> (<u><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/533c646a4b21/an-63how-architecture-search-meta-learning-and-environment-design-could-lead-to-general-intelligence"">AN #63</a></u>)), and seems to be the implicit belief that drives OpenAI and DeepMind&apos;s research agendas. This leads to differences in risk analysis and solutions: for example, the <u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01820"">inner alignment problem</a></u> (<u><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/92b3a9458c2d/an-58-mesa-optimization-what-it-is-and-why-we-should-care"">AN #58</a></u>) only applies to agents arising from learning algorithms, and I suspect would not apply to Stuart&apos;s view of AI progress.</p><p>The book also gives the impression that to solve AI safety, we simply need to make sure that AI systems are optimizing the right objective, at least in the case where there is a single human and a single robot. Again, depending on how future AI systems work, that could be true, but I expect there will be other problems that need to be solved as well. I&apos;ve already mentioned inner alignment; other graduate students at CHAI work on e.g. <u><a href=""https://adversarialpolicies.github.io/"">robustness</a></u> and transparency.</p><p>The proposal for aligning AI requires us to build a model that relates human preferences to human behavior. This sounds extremely hard to get completely right. Of course, we may not need a model that is completely right: since reward uncertainty makes the agent amenable to shutdowns, it seems plausible that we can correct mistakes in the model as they come up. But it&apos;s not obvious to me that this is sufficient.</p><p>The sections on multiple humans are much more speculative and I have more disagreements there, but I expect that is simply because we haven&apos;t done enough research yet. For example, HC worries that we won&apos;t be able to use laws to prevent AIs from doing technically legal but still antisocial things for the benefit of a single human. This seems true if you imagine that a single human suddenly gets access to a superintelligent AI, but when everyone has a superintelligent AI, then the current system where humans socially penalize each other for norm violations may scale up naturally. The overall effect depends on whether AI makes it easier to violate norms, or to detect and punish norm violations.</p><p><strong>Read more:</strong> <u><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RVSAD5GWSLQ42/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B07N5J5FTS"">Max Tegmark&apos;s summary</a></u>, <u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/FuGDYNvA6qh4qyFah/thoughts-on-human-compatible"">Alex Turner&apos;s thoughts</a></u></p><br><p><u><a href=""https://futureoflife.org/2019/10/08/ai-alignment-podcast-human-compatible-artificial-intelligence-and-the-problem-of-control-with-stuart-russell/"">AI Alignment Podcast: Human Compatible: Artificial Intelligence and the Problem of Control</a></u> <em>(Lucas Perry and Stuart Russell)</em>: This podcast covers some of the main ideas from the book, which I&apos;ll ignore for this summary. It also talks a bit about the motivations for the book. Stuart has three audiences in mind. He wants to explain to laypeople what AI is and why it matters. He wants to convince AI researchers that they should be working in this new model of beneficial AI that optimizes for our objectives, rather than the standard model of intelligent AI that optimizes for its objectives. Finally, he wants to recruit academics in other fields to help connect human behavior to human preferences (principle 3), as well as to figure out how to deal with multiple humans.</p><p>Stuart also points out that his book has two main differences from Superintelligence and Life 3.0: first, his book explains how existing AI techniques work (and in particular it explains the standard model), and second, it proposes a technical solution to the problem (the three principles).</p><p><u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03137"">Cooperative Inverse Reinforcement Learning</a></u> <em>(Dylan Hadfield-Menell et al)</em>: This paper provides a formalization of the three principles from the book, in the case where there is a single human H and a single robot R. H and R are trying to optimize the same reward function. Since both H and R are represented in the environment, it can be the <em>human&apos;s</em> reward: that is, it is possible to reward the state where the human drinks coffee, without also rewarding the state where the robot drinks coffee. This corresponds to the first principle: that machines should optimize <em>our</em> objectives. The second principle, that machines should initially be uncertain about our objectives, is incorporated by assuming that <em>only H knows the reward</em>, requiring R to maintain a belief over the reward. Finally, for the third principle, R needs to get information about the reward from H&apos;s behavior, and so R assumes that H will choose actions that best optimize the reward (taking into account the fact that R doesn&apos;t know the reward).</p><p>This defines a two-player game, originally called a CIRL game but now called an <em>assistance game</em>. We can compute optimal joint strategies for H and R. Since this is an <em>interactive</em> process, H can do better than just acting optimally as if R did not exist (the assumption typically made in IRL): H can <em>teach</em> R what the reward is. In addition, R does not simply passively listen and then act, but interleaves learning and acting, and so must manage the explore-exploit tradeoff.</p><p>See also <u><a href=""https://interactive-learning.github.io/"">Learning to Interactively Learn and Assist</a></u> (<u><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/0b74c28413c0/an-64-using-deep-rl-and-reward-uncertainty-to-incentivize-preference-learning"">AN #64</a></u>), which is inspired by this paper and does a similar thing with deep RL.</p><p><strong>Read more:</strong> <u><a href=""https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2017/08/17/cooperatively-learning-human-values/"">BAIR blog post: Cooperatively Learning Human Values</a></u></p><p><u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.08219"">The Off-Switch Game</a></u> <em>(Dylan Hadfield-Menell et al)</em>: This paper studies theoretically the impact of uncertainty over the reward on R&apos;s incentives around potential off switches. It proposes the simplest model that the authors expect to lead to generalizable results. R and H are in an assistance game, in which R goes first. R may either take an action a, getting utility u, or shut itself down, getting utility 0. In either case, the game ends immediately. Alternatively, R can choose to wait, in which case H can either shut down R, getting utility 0, or allow R to go ahead with action a, getting utility u.</p><p>If H is perfectly rational, then waiting is always an optimal action for R, since H will ensure that the team gets max(u, 0) utility. There can be other optimal actions: if R is sure that u &gt;= 0, then taking action a is also optimal, and similarly if R is sure that u &lt;= 0, then shutting down is also optimal. However, if H is not rational, and sometimes fails to take the utility-maximizing action (in a way R can&apos;t predict), then things get murkier. If R is sure about the value of u, then it is never optimal to wait, better to just take the action a (if u &gt;= 0) or shut down (if u &lt; 0) rather than let H screw it up. If R is pretty confident that u is positive, it may still decide to take action a, rather than risk that H makes the wrong decision. However, if R is very uncertain about the sign of u, then waiting becomes optimal again. In general, more uncertainty over the reward leads to more deferential behavior (allowing H to shut it off), but at a cost: R is much less able to help H when it is very uncertain about the reward.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> While I agree with the broad thrust of this paper, I do have one nitpick: the game ends immediately after H chooses whether or not to shut off R. In reality, if R isn&apos;t shut off, the assistance game will continue, which changes the incentives. If R can be relatively confident in the utility of <em>some</em> action (e.g. doing nothing), then it may be a better plan for it to disable the shutdown button, and then take that action and observe H in the mean time to learn the reward. Then, after it has learned more about the reward and figured out why H wanted to shut it down, it can act well and get utility (rather than being stuck with the zero utility from being shut down). While this doesn&apos;t seem great, it&apos;s not <em>obviously</em> bad: R ends up doing nothing until it can figure out how to actually be useful, hardly a catastrophic outcome. Really bad outcomes only come if R ends up becoming confident in the wrong reward due to some kind of misspecification, as suggested in <u><a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.06275"">Incorrigibility in the CIRL Framework</a></u>, summarized next.</p><p><u><a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.06275"">Incorrigibility in the CIRL Framework</a></u> <em>(Ryan Carey)</em>: This paper demonstrates that when the agent has an <em>incorrect</em> belief about the human&apos;s reward function, then you no longer get the benefit that the agent will obey shutdown instructions. It argues that since the purpose of a shutdown button is to function as a safety measure of last resort (when all other measures have failed), it should not rely on an assumption that the agent&apos;s belief about the reward is correct.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> I certainly agree that if the agent is wrong in its beliefs about the reward, then it is quite likely that it would not obey shutdown commands. For example, in the off switch game, if the agent is incorrectly certain that u is positive, then it will take action a, even though the human would want to shut it down.

For a discussion of how serious the overall critique is, both from HC&apos;s perspective and mine, see the opinion on the next post.</p><p><u><a href=""https://arbital.com/p/updated_deference/"">Problem of fully updated deference</a></u> <em>(Eliezer Yudkowsky)</em>: This article points out that even if you have an agent with uncertainty over the reward function, it will acquire information and reduce its uncertainty over the reward, until eventually it can&apos;t reduce uncertainty any more, and then it would simply optimize the expectation of the resulting distribution, which is equivalent to optimizing a known objective, and has the same issues (such as disabling shutdown buttons).</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> As with the previous paper, this argument is only really a problem when the agent&apos;s belief about the reward function is <em>wrong</em>: if it is correct, then at the point where there is no more information to gain, the agent should already know that humans don&apos;t like to be killed, do like to be happy, etc. and optimizing the expectation of the reward distribution should lead to good outcomes. Both this and the previous critique are worrisome when you can&apos;t even put a reasonable <em>prior</em> over the reward function, which is quite a strong claim.</p><p>HC&apos;s response is that the agent should never assign zero probability to any hypothesis. It suggests that you could have an expandable hierarchical prior, where initially there are relatively simple hypotheses, but as hypotheses become worse at explaining the data, you &quot;expand&quot; the set of hypotheses, ultimately bottoming out at (perhaps) the universal prior. I think that such an approach could work in principle, and there are two challenges in practice. First, it may not be computationally feasible to do this. Second, it&apos;s not clear how such an approach can deal with the fact that human preferences <em>change</em> over time. (HC does want more research into both of these.)</p><p>Fully updated deference could also be a problem if the <em>observation model</em> used by the agent is incorrect, rather than the prior. I&apos;m not sure if this is part of the argument.</p><p><u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.02827"">Inverse Reward Design</a></u> <em>(Dylan Hadfield-Menell et al)</em>: Usually, in RL, the reward function is treated as the <em>definition</em> of optimal behavior, but this conflicts with the third principle, which says that human behavior is the ultimate source of information about human preferences. Nonetheless, reward functions clearly have some information about our preferences: how do we make it compatible with the third principle? We need to connect the reward function to human behavior somehow.</p><p>This paper proposes a simple answer: since reward designers usually make reward functions through a process of trial-and-error where they test their reward functions and see what they incentivize, the reward function <em>tells us about optimal behavior in the <strong>training</strong> environment(s)</em>. The authors formalize this using a Boltzmann rationality model, where the reward designer is more likely to pick a <em>proxy reward</em> when it gives higher <em>true reward</em> in the <em>training environment</em> (but it doesn&apos;t matter if the proxy reward becomes decoupled from the true reward in some test environment). With this assumption connecting the human behavior (i.e. the proxy reward function) to the human preferences (i.e. the true reward function), they can then perform Bayesian inference to get a posterior distribution over the <em>true</em> reward function.</p><p>They demonstrate that by using risk-averse planning with respect to this posterior distribution, the agent can avoid negative side effects that it has never seen before and has no information about. For example, if the agent was trained to collect gold in an environment with dirt and grass, and then it is tested in an environment with lava, the agent will know that even though the specified reward was indifferent about lava, this doesn&apos;t mean much, since <em>any</em> weight on lava would have led to the same behavior in the training environment. Due to risk aversion, it conservatively assumes that the lava is bad, and so successfully avoids it.</p><p>See also <u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.03060"">Active Inverse Reward Design</a></u> (<u><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/d7b5059d64ed/alignment-newsletter-24"">AN #24</a></u>), which builds on this work.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> I really like this paper as an example of how to apply the third principle. This was the paper that caused me to start thinking about how we should be thinking about the assumed vs. actual information content in things (here, the key insight is that RL typically assumes that the reward function conveys much more information than it actually does). That probably influenced the development of <u><a href=""https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2019/02/11/learning_preferences/"">Preferences Implicit in the State of the World</a></u> (<u><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/35b451cb4d70/alignment-newsletter-45"">AN #45</a></u>), which is also an example of the third principle and this information-based viewpoint, as it argues that the state of the world is caused by human behavior and so contains information about human preferences.</p><p>It&apos;s worth noting that in this paper the lava avoidance is both due to the belief over the true reward, <em>and the risk aversion</em>. The agent would also avoid pots of gold in the test environment if it never saw it in the training environment. IRD only gives you the correct uncertainty over the true reward; it doesn&apos;t tell you how to use that uncertainty. You would still need safe exploration, or some other source of information, if you want to reduce the uncertainty.</p>",rohinmshah,rohinmshah,Rohin Shah,

The paper is annoying trapped inside a Word document, which is about as bad as the standard PDF situation but bad in different ways, so I&apos;ve included here the abstract, the conclusion, and a choice quote from the middle of the paper that captures the author&apos;s thesis.</p><p>I&apos;m not very convinced that the author is right because his thesis is somewhat vague and depends on a vague definition of &quot;cognitive control&quot; (explained in more detail in the paper, quick Googling didn&apos;t turn up a straightforward summary of the concept, though the author claims it is a common term within neuroscience even if different authors mean slightly different things by it), but this is a more detailed account of mind wandering than I&apos;ve seen before, and it gets points in my book for offering testable predictions that may confirm or deny the theory.</p><h1>Abstract</h1><blockquote>I seek an explanation for the etiology and the function of mind wandering episodes. My proposal &#x2013; which I call the cognitive control proposal &#x2013; is that mind wandering is a form of non-conscious guidance due to cognitive control. When the agent&#x2019;s current goal is deemed insufficiently rewarding, the cognitive control system initiates a search for a new, more rewarding goal. This search is the process of unintentional mind wandering. After developing the proposal, and relating it to literature on mind wandering and on cognitive control, I discuss explanations the proposal affords, testable predictions the proposal makes, and philosophical implications the proposal has.</blockquote><h1>Author&apos;s Thesis</h1><blockquote>The possibility is this. Depending on the cognitive control system&#x2019;s model of the value of various control signals, in cases containing relatively little expected value the system may select a package of control signals leading to exploration. These would be cases in which the goal is to find a new and better goal. And the method, which remains here unclear &#x2013; although one could imagine it involving shifts of attention, construction of task sets involving imagination, inhibition of current goals, etc. &#x2013; might be generally described as disengagement from the present task in order to set out upon a search for a more valuable task.</blockquote><blockquote>The cognitive control proposal, then, is this. Mind wandering is caused by the cognitive control system precisely when, and because, the expected value of whatever the agent is doing &#x2013; usually, exercising control towards achievement of some occurrent goal &#x2013; is deemed too low, and this &#x2018;too low&#x2019; judgment generates a search for a better goal, or task. Perhaps, for example, the estimation of expected value dips below a value threshold attached to the package of control signals that generate exploration for another goal, or task. Or perhaps the value is always computed in comparison with available options, such that mind wandering is sometimes initiated even in the face of a rewarding current task.</blockquote><blockquote>This is a straightforwardly empirical proposal, and should be assessed in terms of the explanations it affords, and by whether the predictions it makes are confirmed or disconfirmed.</blockquote><h1>Conclusion</h1><blockquote>In this paper I have asked why the mind wanders. I focused on a sub-type of mind wandering &#x2013; mind wandering that occurs independently of any reportable intention. I proposed that unintentional mind wandering is sometimes initiated and sustained by aspects of cognitive control. Unintentional mind wandering is caused by the cognitive control system precisely when, and because, the expected value of whatever the agent is doing &#x2013; usually, exercising control towards achievement of some occurrent goal &#x2013; is deemed too low, and this &#x2018;too low&#x2019; judgment generates a search for a better goal, or task.</blockquote><blockquote>This proposal generates testable predictions, and suggests open possibilities regarding the kinds of computations that may underlie unintentional mind wandering. My hope is that by connecting research on mind wandering with research on cognitive control resource allocation, fruitful strategies for modelling these computations may be taken from cognitive control research and deployed to help explain the initiation and dynamics of mind wandering episodes.</blockquote><blockquote>The cognitive control proposal also points us towards a fuller picture of human agency. On this picture, action control and intelligent thought are stitched together by conscious and non-conscious processes operating in concert. Future empirical work is critical to confirmation of this picture, and to filling in the many unspecified details. This is so not least because, if the proposal I offer is on track, agents are not introspectively aware of the (good) rationale behind many mind wandering episodes.</blockquote>",gworley,gordon-seidoh-worley,Gordon Seidoh Worley,

YR4PsLavhd5Dx5L6v,Archiving Yahoo Groups,archiving-yahoo-groups,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/YR4PsLavhd5Dx5L6v/archiving-yahoo-groups,2019-10-18T11:20:01.851Z,43,15,9,False,False,,"<p>

On December 14th Yahoo will 

<a href=""https://help.yahoo.com/kb/SLN31010.html"">shut down Yahoo
Groups</a>.  Since my communities have mostly moved away from


@yahoogroups.com hosting, to Facebook,


@googlegroups, and other places, the bit that hit me was that
they are deleting all the mailing list archives.



</p><p>

Digital archives of text conversations are close to ideal from the
perspective of a historian: unlike in-person or audio-based
interaction this naturally leaves a skimmable and easily searchable
record.  If I want to know, say, what people were thinking about in
the early days of GiveWell, their <a href=""https://blog.givewell.org/2007/01/"">early blog posts</a>
(including comments) are a great source.  Their <a href=""https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/givewell/info"">early mailing
list archives</a>, however, are about to be deleted.

</p>

<p>

Luckily we still have two months to export the data before it's wiped,
and people have written tools to do automate this.  Here's how to
download a backup of all the conversations in a group:

</p>

<p>

</p>

<pre>
# Download the archiver
$ git clone https://github.com/andrewferguson/YahooGroups-Archiver.git

$ cd YahooGroups-Archiver/

# Start archiving the group.
$ python archive_group.py [group-name]
</pre>



<p>

If things are going well it will start spitting out messages like:

</p>

<p>

</p>

<pre>
Archiving message 1 of 8098
Archiving message 2 of 8098
Archiving message 3 of 8098
</pre>



<p>

And it will be creating files:

</p>

<pre>
$ ls [group-name]/
1.json
2.json
3.json
...
</pre>



<p>

If you get a message like:

</p>

<pre>
Archiving message 5221 of 8098
Archiving message 5222 of 8098
Archiving message 5223 of 8098
Cannot get message 5223, attempt
   1 of 3 due to HTTP status code 500
Cannot get message 5223, attempt
   2 of 3 due to HTTP status code 500
Cannot get message 5223, attempt
   3 of 3 due to HTTP status code 500
Archive halted - it appears Yahoo has blocked you. Check if you can
   access the group's homepage from your browser. If you can't, you
   have been blocked. Don't worry, in a few hours (normally less than
   3) you'll be unblocked and you can run this script again - it'll
   continue where you left off.
</pre>

It may mean that you have been blocked, but it may also just mean that
for some reason an individual message can't be downloaded.  In that
case, to tell it to give up on that message and just continue on,
create the json file with the stuck message number:



<pre>
$ touch [group-name]/5223.json
</pre>

You might also get a message like:



<pre>
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""archive_group.py"", line 150, in 
    archive_group(sys.argv[1])
  File ""archive_group.py"", line 71, in archive_group
    max = group_messages_max(groupName)
  File ""archive_group.py"", line 94, in group_messages_max
    raise valueError
  File ""archive_group.py"", line 87, in group_messages_max
    pageJson = json.loads(pageHTML)
  ...
    raise JSONDecodeError(""Expecting value"", s, err.value) from None
json.decoder.JSONDecodeError: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)
</pre>

This is what I see if I try to archive a private group.  It's still
possible to use the tool to archive a private group that you have
access to, but it's a bit involved.  First you visit Yahoo Groups in
your web browser with Devtools open to the Networking tab.  Then you
look at what cookies are set on the HTML request, and find the


T and 

Y cookies.  The 

T cookie should start
with 

z= and the 

Y cookie should start with


v=.  Paste these into the 

cookie_T and


cookie_Y variable definitions at the beginning of


archive_group.py.



<p>

Once you've downloaded all the messages in a group you can run:

</p>

<pre>
$ pip2 install natsort
$ python2 make_Yearly_Text_Archive_html.py [group-name]
</pre>

Which will create a bunch of files like


[group-name]-archive/archive-YYYY.html.  They're not that
easy to read, because it doesn't do any kind of quote folding, but we
can always do that later.  If you made any empty files to get around
messages that wouldn't archive (see the 

touch command above)
you'll get an error at this stage; just delete the empty files and
re-run.



<p>

I've archived five groups: <a href=""https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/givewell/info"">givewell</a>,
<a href=""https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/Boston-Contra/info"">Boston-Contra</a>,
<a href=""https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/BostonAreaContraCommunity/info"">BostonAreaContraCommunity</a>,
<a href=""https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/contrasf/info"">contrasf</a>, and
<a href=""https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/trad-dance-callers/info"">trad-dance-callers</a>.
The first two are public groups with public archives, so I've made
archives available at <a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/givewell-archive"">/givewell-archive</a> and <a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/Boston-Contra-archive"">/Boston-Contra-archive</a>.  The
remaining three are private, but if you want to look at them and you
were a participant or otherwise have a good reason let me know.

One of the core ideas is to write down everything, collect it in an inbox and sort it once a day.</p><p>This lead to me writing down tons of small tasks. I used Todoist to construct a system that worked for me &#x2014; and rarely missed tasks.</p><p>It also lead to me getting a lot of ideas, that could sprout a bunch of tasks. But ideas are much different from tasks to me. They&#x2019;re something that I might, but probably won&#x2019;t complete. Something that may come in useful in the future. And plain fun to come up with.</p><p>I stored them in Todoist as well, but recently I&#x2019;ve started considering whether that&#x2019;s wise. They started weighing on me. It became a growing list of possibilities, many of which I&#x2019;d never finish. The task at the top of my list became the top of my priorities, simply because of its location.</p><p>There must be a better way.</p><p>But what might that look like? </p><h1>The ideal idea-management system</h1><h2><strong>1. Separates ideas from commitments</strong></h2><p>I want a system that separates obligations from ideas. Form follows function, so I&#x2019;d prefer something that doesn&#x2019;t structure ideas in lists. This rules out Todoist completely.</p><h2><strong>2. Shows you the right ideas at the right time</strong></h2><p>Even with complete foreknowledge, finding the perfect schedule might be practically impossible. In contrast, thinking on your feet and reacting as jobs come in won&#x2019;t give you as perfect a schedule as if you&#x2019;d seen into the future-but the best you can do is much easier to compute. &#x2014; Algorithms to Live By</p><p>Most of us live dynamic lives where priorities change often. Your children start a new hobby, you&#x2019;re handed a task at work, or you can finally work on your passion-project. Your idea-management system should reflect this. It shouldn&#x2019;t just show you your most recent idea, it should make it easy to find ideas associated with whatever you find most important right now.</p><p>Avoiding lists makes it more likely that you take action on ideas that matter to you right now. You don&#x2019;t skim from the top, you go for the area that matters and find ideas related to it.</p><p>If you sort ideas around a central node, you can pin-point synergies and conflicts. If you&#x2019;ve taken notes on 4 different project-management systems, you want to see them all when you need them.</p><h2><strong>3. Doesn&#x2019;t distract you with ideas that you can&#x2019;t execute</strong></h2><p>You don&#x2019;t want to waste time considering ideas that aren&#x2019;t important right now. Sometimes you&#x2019;re missing resources, or you&#x2019;re waiting for some dependency.</p><p>Project/idea-lists are terrible at this. As you skim through them, a plethora of memories activate, most of which are irrelevant to what you end up doing.</p><h2><strong>4. Allows you to break down ideas into smaller parts, and re-combine them as needed</strong></h2><p>Tiago Forte&#x2019;s Intermediate Packets inspired this. Many of our ideas can work in exactly the same way.</p><h2><strong>5. Has low overhead</strong></h2><p>You want to spend as little time as possible sorting and searching through your ideas. This should be a no-brainer. You want it to be easy to inter-link ideas and to add reference material. And when you get an idea on the train, you want to offload it without wasting time.</p><h1><strong>Time for action</strong></h1><p>Okay, Martin, I&#x2019;m sold. But folders, task-managers, outliners like Workflowy and Dynalist &#x2014; they&#x2019;re all hierarchical!</p><p>You&#x2019;re right, and until last week, I didn&#x2019;t know what other solution there could be. But now there is. <a href=""http://roamresearch.com"">Roam</a>.</p><span><figure><img src=""https://roamresearch.com/assets/images/Roam-Group-min.png"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:40%""></figure></span><p>Roam is different. It makes it trivial to link- and back-link pages. It creates a new page just by linking to it. And it back-links as well! When you link [[Self-determination theory]] to [[Motivation]], the motivation page will show a link to Self-determination theory in its footnotes.</p><p>This is tremendous. It creates a clear divide between commitments and ideas. Commitments belong on lists, ideas in dynamic networks.</p><p>When you get a new idea on a motivation tweak, you add it and link it to [[Motivation]].</p><p>Most of the time, everything is going well, so you don&#x2019;t need it right now. But 6 months later, you&#x2019;re assigned a grind of a task. You decide to read up on on Motivation, and voil&#xE1;, in the footnotes is a link to that idea you had that might help you now.</p><p>Not only that, all your other ideas on motivation are there, for you to synergise or compare/contrast.</p><p>And you&#x2019;re less distracted. You don&#x2019;t have to take action on an idea in fear of forgetting it. Nor are you presented with ideas only because they&#x2019;re recent. You have a need, [[Motivation]], and you&#x2019;re presented with ideas on that topic alone. No distraction.</p><p>Roam also allows you to link to any bullet-point in any other note. Say you want your collaborators to identify with the core values of your projects. Why not embed that idea you encountered 3 months ago from Organismic Integration Theory? In this way, you can re-use sub-ideas from other major themes in any of your other projects. And if you find out that idea didn&#x2019;t work? You add a note, and that note propagates to any other places you&#x2019;ve referenced the idea.</p><p>Roam becomes your second brain. You draw associations, and Roam remembers. You want to look something up, and Roam shows you what you&#x2019;ve considered relevant in the past.</p><h1><strong>How do you avoid losing track of important projects?</strong></h1><p>I advocate for using Roam as an idea-management system, not a project-management system. If you have an obligation, by all means track it in a list-style way that you review.</p><p>But if it&#x2019;s an idea, you don&#x2019;t want to spend time thinking about it when you&#x2019;re executing something else. You want focus and produce, and to save the idea for when there&#x2019;s time and a need. Don&#x2019;t just be efficient, be effective.</p><p>There is nothing so useless as doing efficiently what should not be done at all &#x2014; Peter Drucker</p><h1><strong>The Nitty Gritty, A Recipe for Implementation</strong></h1><p>For each idea that may turn into a project, I create a new page in this format:</p><p>&#x201C;PI: Description&#x201D;, eg. &#x201C;PI: Research How to Effectively Integrate Motivations&#x201D;</p><p>I have 3 prefixes:</p><ol><li>PI for &#x201C;Project Idea&#x201D;</li><li>WO for &#x201C;Working On&#x201D;</li><li>AP for &#x201C;Archived Project&#x201D;</li></ol><p>In each of these pages, I spend ~5 seconds referencing concepts where I may want to encounter the project. For this one, [[Motivation]], [[Self-Determination Theory]] and [[Organismic Integration Theory (OIT)]].</p><p>I also add any references I may want to read, and whichever ideas I&#x2019;ve already had about the project.</p><p>This makes it trivial to pick up the idea when I have the time and need, and to execute it efficiently.</p><p>~</p><p>These posts are about getting ideas into the wild, having other people criticise them, making them better and connecting with like-minded people.

Now, what other ways are there of creating <strong>hope</strong>? Here’s a thought that occurs at once: Many useful discoveries have been made accidentally by men who weren’t looking for <em>them</em> but were busy about other things; so no-one can doubt that if men seek for something and are busy about <em>it</em>, proceeding in an orderly and not a slapdash way, they will discover far more. Of course it can happen occasionally that someone accidentally stumbles on a result that he wouldn’t have found if he had searched hard for it, but on the whole the opposite is the case—·things are discovered by methodical searching that couldn’t have been found by accident·. So, far better things, and more of them, and at shorter intervals, are to be <strong>hoped</strong> for from •hard thinking, hard focussed work and concentration than from •·lucky· accidents, undisciplined whims and the like, which until now have been the main source of discoveries.</p><p><strong>109.</strong> Here is another ground for <strong>hope</strong>: Discoveries have sometimes been made that would have been almost unthinkable in advance, and would have been written off as impossible. Men think about the <em>new</em> in terms of the <em>old</em>: to questions about what the •future holds they bring an imagination indoctrinated and coloured by the •past. This is a terrible way of forming opinions, because streams fed by nature’s springs don’t run along familiar channels.</p><p>Suppose that before gunpowder was invented someone described it in terms of its effects—‘There is a new invention by means of which the strongest towers and walls can be demolished from a long way off’. That would no doubt have set men thinking about how to increase the power of <em>catapults</em> and <em>wheeled ramming devices</em>. The notion of a fiery blast suddenly and forcefully expanding and exploding would hardly have entered into any man’s mind or imagination, because nothing closely analogous to that had ever been seen. Well, except perhaps in earthquakes and lightning, but <em>they</em> wouldn’t have been seen as relevant because they are mighty works of <em>nature</em> which <em>men</em> couldn’t imitate.</p><p>Or suppose that before the discovery of silk someone had said: ‘They’ve discovered new a kind of thread for use in clothing and furniture-coverings; it is finer, softer, more beautiful and <em>stronger</em> than linen or wool.’ Men would have begun to think of some silky kind of plant or of very fine hair of some animal or of the feathers and down of birds; they would <em>not</em> have thought of a web woven by a tiny worm in great quantities and renewing itself yearly. If anyone <em>had</em> said anything about a worm, he’d have been laughed at as dreaming of a new kind of cobweb! [Bacon then gives a third example: the magnet.] Yet these things and others like them lay concealed from men for centuries, and when they did come to light it wasn’t through science or any technical skill but by accident and coincidence. As I have remarked, they were so <em>utterly</em> different in kind from anything previously known that they couldn’t possibly have been discovered through a preconceived notion of them.</p><p>So there are strong grounds for <strong>hoping</strong> that nature has concealed in its folds many wonderfully useful •things that aren’t related to or parallel with anything that is now known, and lie right outside our imaginative reach. As the centuries roll on, •they too will doubtless come to light of their own accord in some roundabout way, as did gunpowder and the others; but by the method I am discussing they can be presented and anticipated speedily, suddenly and all at once.</p><p><strong>110.</strong> Other discoveries prove that this can happen: splendid discoveries are lying at our feet, and we step over them without seeing them. The discoveries of</p><ul><li>gunpowder,</li><li>silk,</li><li>the magnet,</li><li>sugar,</li><li>paper,</li></ul><p>or the like may seem to depend on certain properties of things of and nature—·properties that might have been hard to discover·. But there is nothing in <em>printing</em> that isn’t wide open and almost easy. All that was needed was to see that</p><ul><li>although it is harder to arrange letter-types than to write by hand, the two procedures differ in that once the types have been arranged any number of impressions can be made from them, whereas hand-writing provides only a single copy,</li></ul><p>and to see that</p><ul><li>ink can be so thickened so that it does its job but doesn’t run, especially when the type faces upwards and the ink is rolled onto it from above.</li></ul><p>It was merely because they didn’t notice <em>these</em> ·obvious· facts that men went for so many ages without this most beautiful invention which is so useful in the spreading of knowledge.</p><p>But the human mind is such a mess when it comes to this business of discoveries that it first •distrusts and then •despises itself:</p><ul><li>before the discovery: it is not credible that any such thing can be found,</li><li>afterwards: it is incredible that the world should have missed it for so long!</li></ul><p>And this very thing entitles us to some <strong>hope</strong>, namely the hope that there is a great mass of discoveries still to be made—not just ones that will have to be dug out by techniques that we don’t yet have, but also ones that may come to light through our transferring, ordering and applying things that we do know already, this being done with the help of the experimental approach that I call ‘literate’ [<strong>101</strong>].</p><p><strong>111.</strong> Another ground of <strong>hope</strong> should be mentioned. Let men reflect on their infinite expenditure of intellect, time, and means on things of <em>far</em> less use and value ·than the discoveries I am talking about·. If even a small part of this were directed to sound and solid studies, there is no difficulty that couldn’t be overcome. I mention this ·matter of the use of resources· because a collection of Natural and Experimental History, as I envisage it and as it ought to be, is a great—as it were, a <em>royal</em>—work, and I freely admit that it will involve much labour and expense.</p><p>[It will appear in Book <strong>2-11</strong> that the ‘collection’ Bacon talks of is an orderly written account of phenomena, experiments and their results, not a physical museum.]</p><p><strong>112.</strong> In the meantime, don’t be put off by <em>how many</em> particulars there are; rather, let this give you <strong>hope</strong>. ·The fact is that you will be in worse trouble if you <em>don’t</em> engage with them·; for the •particular phenomena of nature are a mere handful compared to the ·great multitudes of· •things that human ingenuity can fabricate if it cuts itself off from the clarifying effects of reality. And this road ·through the study of <em>real</em> events· soon leads to open ground, whereas the other—·the route through <em>invented</em> theories and thought-experiments·— leads to nothing but endless entanglement. Until now men haven’t lingered long with •experience; they have brushed past it on their way to the ingenious •theorizings on which they have wasted unthinkable amounts of time. But if we had someone at hand who could answer our questions of the form ‘What are the <em>facts</em> about this matter?’, it wouldn’t take many years for us to discover all causes and complete every science [the Latin literally means ‘to discover all causes and sciences’].</p><p><strong>113.</strong> Men may take some <strong>hope</strong>, I think, from my own example (I’m not boasting; just trying to be useful). If you are discouraged ·about the chances of progress in the sciences·, look at me!</p><ul><li>I am <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Bacon#Biography"">busier with affairs of state</a> than any other man of my time,</li><li>I lose a lot of time to ill-health, and</li><li>in this ·scientific· work I am wholly a pioneer, not following in anyone’s tracks and not getting advice from anyone.</li></ul><p>And yet, ·despite these three sources of difficulty·, I think I have pushed things on a certain amount by sticking to the true road and submitting my mind to reality. Well, then, think what might be expected (now that I have pointed out the way) from men</p><ul><li>with plenty of free time,</li><li>·in good health·, and</li><li>working together, on the basis of previous work ·by others·.</li></ul><p>Unlike the work of sheerly <em>thinking up</em> hypotheses, proper scientific work <em>can</em> be done collaboratively; the best way is for men’s efforts (especially in collecting experimental results) to be exerted separately and then brought together. Men will begin to know their strength only when they go this way—with one taking charge of one thing and another of another, instead of all doing all the same things.</p><p><strong>114.</strong> Lastly, even if the breeze of <strong>hope</strong> that blows on us from that New Continent were fainter and less noticeable than it is, still we have to <em>try</em>—unless we prefer to have minds that are altogether abject! The loss that may come from •not trying is much greater than what may come from ·trying and· •not succeeding: by •not trying we throw away the chance of an immense good; by •not succeeding we only incur the loss of a little human labour. But from what I have said (and from some things that I <em>haven’t</em> said) it seems to me that there is more than enough <strong>hope</strong> not only •to get a vigorous man to <em>try</em> but also to make a sober-minded and wise man <em>believe</em> ·that he will succeed·.</p><p><strong>115.</strong> That completes what I wanted to say about getting rid of the pessimism that has been one of the most powerful factors delaying and hindering the progress of the sciences. I have also finished with the signs and causes of errors, of sluggishness and of the prevailing ignorance. ·I’ve said more about this than you might think·, because the more subtle causes—the ones that aren’t generally noticed or thought about—come under what I said about the ‘idols’ of the human mind.</p><p>And this should also bring to an end the part of my Great Fresh Start [see note in <strong><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/GTEay24Lxm3xoE4hy/p/TuPA9JXLSafSC4Knh"">31</a></strong>] that is devoted to <em>rejection</em>, which I have carried out through three refutations:</p><blockquote>(1) the refutation of innate human reason left to itself [<a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/GTEay24Lxm3xoE4hy/p/MYNNvgxSYmK7f4JBt"">see Preface</a>];<br>(2) the refutation of demonstrations [see <strong><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/GTEay24Lxm3xoE4hy/p/GRGk3468ozwrHPYkm"">44</a></strong> and <strong><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/GTEay24Lxm3xoE4hy/p/vTCzM8bTPk4ANXsY6"">69</a></strong>];<br>(3) the refutation of the accepted philosophical doctrines [see <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/GTEay24Lxm3xoE4hy/p/kpwgYj6EyqzEwNjDE""><strong>60</strong>–<strong>62</strong></a>].</blockquote><p>I refuted these in the ·only· way I <em>could</em> do so, namely through signs and the evidence of causes. I couldn’t engage in any other kind of confutation because I differ from my opponents both on first principles and on rules of demonstration.</p><p>So now it is time to proceed to the actual techniques for interpreting nature and to the rules governing them—except that there is <em>still</em> something that has to be said first! In this first book of aphorisms my aim has been to prepare men’s minds not just for •<em>understanding</em> what was to follow but for •<em>accepting</em> it; and now that I have •cleared up and washed down and levelled the floor of the mind, I have to •get the mind into a good attitude towards the things I am laying before it—to <em>look kindly</em> on them, as it were. ·This has to be worked for·, because anything new will be confronted by prejudgments ·against it·, not only ones created by old opinions but also ones created by false ideas about what the new thing is going to be. So I shall try to create sound and true opinions about what I am going to propose; but this is only a stop-gap expedient—a kind of security deposit—to serve until I can make the stuff itself thoroughly known.</p><p><strong>116.</strong> First, then, don’t think that I want to found a new sect in philosophy—like the ancient Greeks and like some moderns such as Telesio, Patrizzi or Severinus. For that’s not what I am up to; and I really don’t think that human welfare depends much on what abstract opinions anyone has about nature and its workings. No doubt many old theories of this sort can be revived and many new ones introduced, just as many theories of the heavens can be supposed that fit the phenomena well enough but differ from each other; but I’m not working on such useless speculative matters.</p><p>My purpose, rather, is to see whether I can’t provide humanity’s power and greatness with firmer foundations and greater scope. I have achieved some results—scattered through some special subjects—that I think to be far more true and certain and indeed more fruitful than any that have so far been used (I have collected them in the •fifth part of my Fresh Start); but I don’t yet have a complete theory of everything to propound. It seems that the time hasn’t come for that. I can’t hope to live long enough to complete the •sixth part (which is to present science discovered through the proper interpretation of nature); but I’ll be satisfied if in the middle parts I conduct myself soberly and usefully, sowing for future ages the seeds of a purer truth, and not shying away from the start of great things. [See note in <strong><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/GTEay24Lxm3xoE4hy/p/TuPA9JXLSafSC4Knh"">31</a></strong>.]</p><p><strong>117.</strong> Not being the founder of a sect, I am not handing out bribes or promises of particular works. You may indeed think that because I talk so much about ‘works’ ·or ‘results’· and drag everything over to <em>that</em>, I should produce some myself as a down-payment. Well, I have already clearly said it many times, and am happy now to say it again: my project is not to get</p><blockquote>works from works or<br>experiments from experiments (like the •empirics),</blockquote><p>but rather to get</p><blockquote>causes and axioms from works and experiments,</blockquote><p>and then to get</p><blockquote>new works and experiments from those causes and axioms (like the •legitimate interpreters of nature).</blockquote><p>[An ‘empiric’ is someone who is interested in <em>what</em> works but not in <em>why</em> it works; especially a physician of that sort, as referred to by Locke when he speaks of ‘swallowing down opinions as silly people do empirics’ pills, without knowing what they are made of or how they will work’.]</p><p>If you look at</p><ul><li>my Tables of Discovery that ·will· constitute the fourth part of the Fresh Start, and</li><li>the examples of particulars that I present in the second part, ·i.e. the present work·, and</li><li>my observations on the history that I ·will· sketch in the third part,</li></ul><p>you won’t need any great intellectual skill to see indications and outlines of many fine results all through this material; but I openly admit that the natural history that I have so far acquired, from books and from my own investigations, is too skimpy, and not verified with enough accuracy, to serve the purposes of legitimate interpretation.</p><p>To anyone who is abler and better prepared ·than I am· for mechanical pursuits, and who is clever at getting results from experiment, I say: By all means go to work snipping off bits from my history and my tables and apply them to getting results—this could serve as <em>interest</em> until the <em>principal</em> is available. But I am hunting for bigger game, and I condemn all hasty and premature interruptions for such things as these, which are (as I often say) like Atalanta’s spheres. I don’t go dashing off after golden apples, like a child; I bet everything on art’s winning its race against nature. [<a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/GTEay24Lxm3xoE4hy/p/vTCzM8bTPk4ANXsY6"">On Atalanta and the race see <strong>70</strong></a>.] I don’t scurry around clearing out moss and weeds; I wait for the harvest when the crop is ripe.</p><p><strong>118.</strong> When my history and Tables of Discovery are read, it will surely turn out that some things in the experiments themselves are not quite certain or perhaps even downright false, which may lead you to think that the foundations and principles on which my discoveries rest are ·also· false and doubtful. But this doesn’t matter, for such things are bound to happen at first. It’s like a mere typographical error, which doesn’t much hinder the reader because it is easy to correct as you read. In the same way, ·my· natural history may contain many experiments that are false, but it won’t take long for them to be easily expunged and rejected through the discovery of causes and axioms. It is nevertheless true that if big mistakes come thick and fast in a natural history, they can’t possibly be corrected or amended through any stroke of intelligence or skill. Now, my natural history has been collected and tested with great diligence, strictness and almost <em>religious</em> care, yet there may be errors of detail tucked away in it; so what should be said of run-of-the-mill natural history, which is so careless and <em>easy</em> in comparison with mine? And what of the philosophy and sciences built on that kind of sand (or rather <em>quicksand</em>)? So no-one should be troubled by what I have said.</p><p><strong>119.</strong> My history and experiments will contain many things that are</p><ul><li>trivial, familiar and ordinary, many that are</li><li>mean and low [see <strong>120</strong>], and many that are</li><li>extremely subtle, merely speculative, and seemingly useless [see <strong>121</strong>].</li></ul><p>Such things could lead men to lose interest or to become hostile ·to what I have to offer. I shall give these one paragraph each·.</p><p>Men should bear in mind that until now <em>their</em> activities have consisted only in explaining unusual events in terms of more usual ones, and they have simply taken the usual ones for granted, not asking what explains <em>them</em>. So they haven’t investigated the causes of</p><ul><li>weight,</li><li>rotation of heavenly bodies,</li><li>heat,</li><li>cold,</li><li>light,</li><li>hardness,</li><li>softness,</li><li>rarity,</li><li>density,</li><li>liquidity,</li><li>solidity,</li><li>life,</li><li>lifelessness,</li><li>similarity,</li><li>dissimilarity,</li><li>organicness,</li></ul><p>and the like. They have accepted these as self-evident and obvious, and have devoted their inquiring and quarrelling energies to less common and familiar things.</p><p>But I <em>have to</em> let the most ordinary things into my history, because I know that until we have properly looked for and found the causes of common things and the causes of those causes, we can’t make judgments about uncommon or remarkable things, let alone bring anything new to light. Indeed, I don’t think that anything holds up philosophy more than the fact that common and familiar events don’t cause men to stop and think, but are received casually with no inquiry into their causes. A result of this we need •to pay attention to things that are known and familiar at least as often as •to get information about unknown things.</p><p><strong>120.</strong> As for things that are low or even filthy: as Pliny says, these should be introduced with an apology, but they should be admitted into natural history just as the most splendid and costly things should. And that doesn’t pollute the natural history that admits them; the sun enters the sewer as well as the palace, but isn’t polluted by that! I am not building a monument dedicated to human glory or erecting a pyramid in its honour; what I’m doing is to lay a foundation for a holy temple in the human intellect—a temple modelled on the world. So I follow that model, because whatever is worthy of <em>being</em> is worthy of <em>scientific knowledge</em>, which is the image or likeness of being; and low things <em>exist </em>just as splendid ones do. And another point: just as from certain putrid substances such as musk and civet the sweetest odours are sometimes generated, so also mean and sordid events sometimes give off excellent and informative light. That is enough about this; <em>more </em>than enough, because this sort of squeamishness is downright childish and effeminate.</p><p><strong>121.</strong> The third objection must be looked into much more carefully. I mean the objection that many things in my history will strike ordinary folk, and indeed ·non-ordinary· ones trained in the presently accepted systems, as intricately subtle and <em>useless</em>. It is especially because of this objection that I have said, and should ·again· say, that in the initial stages ·of the inquiry· I am aiming at experiments of light, not experiments of fruit [see <strong>99</strong>]. In this, as I have often said [see <strong>70</strong>], I am following the example of the divine creation which on the first day produced nothing but light, and gave that a day to itself without doing any work with matter. To suppose, therefore, that things like these ·‘subtleties’ of mine· are useless is the same as supposing that light is useless because it isn’t a <em>thing</em>, isn’t solid or material. And well-considered and well-delimited knowledge of simple natures is like light: it gives entrance to all the secrets of nature’s workshop, and has the power to gather up and draw after it whole squadrons of works and floods of the finest axioms; yet there is hardly anything we can <em>do with it</em> just in itself. Similarly the •letters of the alphabet taken separately are useless and meaningless, yet they’re the basic materials for the planning and composition of all discourse. So again the •seeds of things have much latent power, but nothing comes of it except in their development. And ·light is like scientific subtleties in another way, namely·: the scattered rays of light don’t do any good unless they are made to converge.</p><p>If you object to speculative subtleties, what will you say about the schoolmen [= ‘mediaeval and early modern Aristotelians’], who have wallowed in subtleties? And <em>their </em>subtleties were squandered on •words (or on popular notions—same thing!) rather than on •facts or nature; and they were useless the whole way through, unlike mine, which are indeed useless right now but which promise endless benefits later on. But this is sure, and you should know it:</p><blockquote>All subtlety in disputations and other mental bustling about, if it occurs after the axioms have been discovered, comes too late and has things backwards. The true and proper time for subtlety, or anyway the chief time for it, is when pondering experiments and basing axioms on them.</blockquote><p>For that other ·later· subtlety grasps and snatches at [<em>captat</em>] nature but can never get a grip on [<em>capit</em>] it. . . .</p><p>A final remark about the lofty dismissal from natural history of everything •common, everything •low, everything •subtle and as it stands useless: When a haughty monarch rejected a poor woman’s petition as unworthy thing and beneath his dignity, she said: ‘Then leave off being king.’ That may be taken as an oracle. For someone who won’t attend to things like •these because they are too paltry and minute can’t take possession of the kingdom of nature and can’t govern it.</p><p><strong>122.</strong> This may occur to you: ‘It is amazing that you have the nerve to push aside all the sciences and all the authorities at a single blow, doing this single-handed, without bringing in anything from the ancients to help you in your battle and to guard your flanks.’</p><p>Well, I know that if I had been willing to be so dishonest, I could easily have found support and honour for my ideas by referring them either •to ancient times before the time of the Greeks (when natural science may have flourished more ·than it did later·, though <em>quietly</em> because it hadn’t yet been run through the pipes and trumpets of the Greeks), or even, in part at least, •to some of the Greeks themselves. This would be like the men of no family who forge genealogical tables that ‘show’ them to come from a long line of nobility. But I am relying on the evidentness of ·the truth about· things, and I’ll have nothing to do with any form of fiction or fakery. Anyway, it <em>doesn’t matter</em> for the business in hand whether the discoveries being made now •were known to the ancients long ago and •have alternately flourished and withered through the centuries because of the accidents of history (just as it doesn’t matter to mankind whether the New World is the island of Atlantis that the ancients knew about or rather is now discovered for the first time). It doesn’t matter because <em>discoveries</em>—·even if they are <em>re</em>discoveries·—have to be sought [<em>petenda</em>] from the light of nature, not called back [<em>repetenda</em>] from the shadows of antiquity.</p><p>As for the fact that I am finding fault with everyone and everything: when you think about it you’ll see that <em>that</em> kind of censure is more likely to be right than a partial one would be—and less damaging, too. For a partial censure would imply that the errors were not rooted in primary notions, and that there had been some true discoveries; they could have been used to correct the false results, ·and the people concerned would have been to blame for not seeing this·. But in fact the errors were fundamental; they came not so much from false judgment as from not attending to things that should be attended to; so it’s no wonder that men haven’t obtained what they haven’t tried for, haven’t reached a mark that they never set up, haven’t come to the end of a road that they never started on.</p><p>As for the insolence that ·you might think· is inherent in what I am doing: if a man says that</p><blockquote>•his steady hand and good eyes enable him to draw a straighter line or a more perfect circle than anyone else,</blockquote><p>he is certainly •making a comparison of abilities; but if he says only that</p><blockquote>•with the help of a ruler or a pair of compasses can draw a straighter line or a more perfect circle than anyone else can by eye and hand alone,</blockquote><p>he isn’t •making any great boast. And I’m saying this not only about these first initiating efforts of mine but also about everyone who tackles these matters in the future. For my route to discovery in the sciences puts men on the same intellectual level, leaving little to individual excellence, because it does everything by the surest rules and demonstrations. So I attribute my part in all this, as I have often said, to good luck rather than to ability—it’s a product of <em>time</em> rather than of <em>intelligence</em>. For there’s no doubt that luck has something to do with men’s thoughts as well as with their works and deeds.</p><p><strong>123.</strong> Someone once said jokingly ‘It can’t be that we think alike, when one drinks water and the other drinks wine’; and this nicely fits my present situation. Other men, in ancient as well as in modern times, have done their science drinking a crude liquor—like water</p><blockquote><strong>(1)</strong> flowing spontaneously from a spring or <strong>(2)</strong> hauled up by wheels from a well, <strong>(1)</strong>flowing spontaneously from the intellect or <strong>(2)</strong> hauled up by logic.</blockquote><p>Whereas I drink a toast with a liquor strained from countless grapes, ripe and fully seasoned ones that have been gathered and picked in clusters, squeezed in the press, and finally purified and clarified in the vat. No wonder I am at odds with the others!</p><p><strong>124.</strong> This also may occur to you: ‘You say it against others, but it can be said against you, that the goal and mark that you have set up for the sciences is not the true or the best.’ ·The accusation would develop like this·:</p><blockquote>Contemplation of <em>the truth</em> is a worthier and loftier thing than thinking about how <em>big and useful</em> one’s practical results will be. Lingering long and anxiously on •experience and •matter and •the buzz of individual events drags the mind down to earth, or rather sinks it to an underworld of turmoil and confusion, dragging it away from a much more heavenly condition—the serene tranquillity of abstract wisdom.</blockquote><p>Now I <em>agree</em> with this line of thought; what the objectors here point to as preferable is what I too am after, above everything else. For I am laying down in the human intellect the foundations for a <em>true model of the world</em>—the world as it turns out to be, not as one’s reason would like it to be. This can’t be done unless the world is subjected to a very diligent dissection and anatomical study. As for the stupid models of the world that men have dreamed up in philosophical systems—like the work of <em>apes</em>!—they should be utterly scattered to the winds. You need to know what a big difference there is (as I said above [<strong><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/GTEay24Lxm3xoE4hy/p/TuPA9JXLSafSC4Knh"">23</a></strong>]) between the •idols of the human mind and the •ideas in the divine mind. The former are merely arbitrary abstractions; the latter are the creator’s little seals on the things he has created, stamped into matter in true and exquisite lines. In these matters, therefore, truth and usefulness are the very same thing; and practical applications ·of scientific results· are of greater value as pledges of truth than as contributing to the comforts of life.</p><p><strong>125.</strong> Or you may want to say this: ‘You are only doing what the ancients did before you; so that you are likely, after all this grinding and shoving, to end up with one of the systems that prevailed in ancient times.’ The case for this goes as follows:</p><blockquote>The ancients also provided at the outset of their speculations a great store and abundance of examples and particulars, sorted out and labelled in notebooks; then out of them they constructed their systems and techniques; and when after that they had checked out everything they published their results to the world with a scattering of examples for proof and illustration; but they saw no need to take the considerable trouble of publishing their working notes and details of experiments. So they did what builders do: after the house was built they removed the scaffolding and ladders out of sight.</blockquote><p>I’m sure they did! But this objection (or misgiving, rather) will be easily answered by anyone who hasn’t completely forgotten what I have said above. The form of inquiry and discovery that the ancients used—they declared it openly, and it appears on the very face of their writings—was simply this:</p><blockquote>From a few examples and particulars (with some common notions thrown in, and perhaps some of the most popular accepted opinions). they rushed to the most general conclusions, the ·would-be· first principles of ·their· science. Taking the truth of <em>these</em> as fixed and immovable, they proceeded to derive from them—through intermediate propositions— lower-level conclusions out of which they built their system. Then if any new particulars and examples turned up that didn’t fit their views, they either •subtly moulded them into their system by distinctions or explanations of their rules, or •coarsely got rid of them by ·tacking· exceptions ·onto their principles·. As for particulars that weren’t in conflict ·with their views·, they laboured away through thick and thin to assign them causes in conformity with their principles.</blockquote><p>But this wasn’t the experimental natural history that was wanted; far from it. And anyway dashing off to the highest generalities ruined everything.</p><p><strong>126.</strong> will occur to you too: ‘By forbidding men to announce principles and take them as established until they have arrived at the highest generalities in the right way through intermediate steps, you are inviting them to <em>suspend judgment</em>, bringing this whole affair down to Acatalepsy.’ Not so. What I have in mind and am propounding is not Acatalepsy [from Greek, = ‘the doctrine that nothing can be understood’] but rather Eucatalepsy [from Greek, = ‘the provision of what is needed for things to be understood’]. I don’t •disparage the senses, I •serve them; I don’t •ignore the intellect, I •regulate it. And it is surely better that we should</p><blockquote>know everything that we need to know, while thinking that our knowledge doesn’t get to the heart of things</blockquote><p>than that we should</p><blockquote>think our knowledge gets to the heart of things, while we don’t yet know anything we need to know.</blockquote><p><strong>127.</strong> You may want to ask—just as a query, not an objection—whether I am talking only about natural philosophy, or whether instead I mean that the other sciences—logic, ethics and politics—should be conducted in my way. Well, I certainly mean what I have said to apply to them all. Just as •common logic (which rules things by syllogisms) extends beyond natural sciences to all sciences, so does •mine (which proceeds by induction) also embrace everything. I am constructing a history and table of discovery for</p><blockquote>•anger, fear, shame, and the like; for<br>•matters political; and for<br>•the mental operations of memory, composition and division, judgment and the rest,</blockquote><p>just as much as for</p><blockquote>•heat and cold, light, vegetative growth and the like.</blockquote><p>But my method of interpretation ·differs from the common logic in one important respect; my method·, after the history has been prepared and set in order, concerns itself not only with •the movements and activities of the mind (as the common logic does) but also with •the nature of things ·outside the mind·. I guide the mind so that its way of engaging with any particular thing is always appropriate. That’s why my doctrine of interpretation contains many different instructions, fitting the discovery-method according to the quality and condition of the subject-matter of the inquiry.</p><p><strong>128.</strong> ‘Do you want to pull down and destroy the philosophy, arts and sciences that are now practised?’ There ought to be no question about that. Far from wanting to destroy them, I am very willing to see them used, developed and honoured. I don’t want to get in the way of their •giving men something to dispute about, •supplying decoration for discourse, •providing the ‘experts’ with an income, and •facilitating civil life—acting, in short, like coins that have value because men agree to give it to them. Let me clear about this: what I am presenting won’t be much use for purposes such as those, since it can’t be brought within reach of the minds of the vulgar except ·indirectly·, through effects and works. My published writings, especially my <em>Two Books on the Advancement of Learning</em>, show well enough the sincerity of my declaration of friendly good will toward the accepted sciences, so I shan’t expend more words on that topic here. Meanwhile I give clear and constant warning that the methods now in use won’t lead to any great progress in the theoretical parts of the sciences, and won’t produce much in the way of applied-science results either.</p><p><strong>129.</strong> All that remains for me to say are a few words about the excellence of the end in view. If I had said them earlier they might have seemed like mere <em>prayers</em>; but perhaps they’ll have greater weight now, when hopes have been created and unfair prejudices removed. I wouldn’t have said them even now if I had done the whole job myself, not calling on anyone else to help with the work, because ·words said in praise of the object of this exercise· might be taken as a proclamation of my own deserts. But ·I’m not going it alone·; I do want to energize others and kindle their zeal, so it is appropriate that I put men in mind of some things, ·even at the risk of <em>seeming</em> to boast·.</p><p>The making of great ·scientific· discoveries seems to have pride of place among human actions. That was the attitude of the ancients: they honoured the makers of discoveries as though they were <em>gods</em>, but didn’t go higher than <em>demigods</em> in their honours for those who did good service in the state (founders of cities and empires, legislators, saviours of their country from long endured evils, quellers of tyrannies, and the like). And if you think accurately about the two ·kinds of benefactor· you will see that the ancients were right about them. Why? <strong>(1)</strong> Because the benefits of ·scientific· discoveries can •extend to the whole of mankind, and can •last for all time, whereas civil benefits •apply only to particular places and •don’t last for very long.</p><p><strong>(2)</strong> Also, improvements in civil matters usually bring violence and confusion with them, whereas ·scientific· discoveries bring delight, and confer benefits without causing harm or sorrow to anyone.</p><p>·Scientific· discoveries are like new creations, imitations of God’s works. . . . It seems to be worth noting that Solomon, the marvel of the world, though mighty in empire and in gold, in the magnificence of his works, his court, his household, his fleet, and the lustre of his name, didn’t glory in any of these, but pronounced that ‘It is the glory of God to conceal a thing; but the honour of kings is to search out a matter’ (<em>Proverbs</em> 25:2).</p><p>If you compare how men live in the most civilized provinces of Europe with how they live in the wildest and most barbarous areas of the American continent, you will think the difference is big enough—the difference in •the condition of the people in themselves as well as in •what conveniences and comforts they have available to them—to justify the saying that ‘man is a god to man’. And this difference doesn’t come from the Europeans’ having better soil, a better climate, or better physiques, but from the arts [see note on ‘art’ <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/Text/preface.xhtml#art"">here</a>].</p><p>Notice the <em>vigour</em> of discoveries, their power to generate consequences. This is nowhere more obvious than in three discoveries that the ancients didn’t know and whose origins (all quite recent) were obscure and humdrum. I am talking about the arts of •printing, •gunpowder, and •the nautical compass. These three have changed the whole aspect and state of things throughout the world—the first in literature, the second in warfare, the third in navigation—bringing about countless changes; so that there seems to have been no empire, no philosophical system, no star that has exerted greater power and influence in human affairs than these mechanical discoveries.</p><p>For my next point, I need to distinguish the three kinds— three <em>levels</em>, as it were—of human ambition. <strong>(1)</strong> Some people want to extend their power within their own country, which is a commonplace and inferior kind of ambition. <strong>(2)</strong> Some work to extend the power and dominion of their country in relation to mankind in general; this is certainly not as base as <strong>(1)</strong> is, but it is just as much a case of greed. <strong>(3)</strong> If a man tries to get mankind’s power and control over the universe off to a fresh start, and to extend it, <em>his</em>ambition (if it is ambition at all) is certainly more wholesome and noble ·than the other two·. Now—·this being the point I wanted to make·—man’s control over things depends wholly on the arts and sciences, for we can’t command nature except by obeying her.</p><p>A further point: it sometimes happens that •one particular discovery is so useful to mankind that the person who made it and thus put the whole human race into his debt is regarded as superhuman; so how much higher a thing it is to discover something through which •everything else can easily be discovered! ·Not that a discovery’s consequences are the main thing about it·. <em>Light</em> is useful in countless ways, enabling us to walk, practise our arts, read, recognize one another, and yet something that is finer and lovelier than all those uses of light is <em>seeing light</em>. Similarly, merely contemplating things as they are, without superstition or imposture, error or confusion, is in itself worthier than all the practical upshots of discoveries.</p><p>Final point: If anyone counts it against the arts and sciences that they can be debased for purposes of wickedness, luxury, and the like, don’t be influenced by that. The same can be said of all earthly goods: intelligence, courage, strength, beauty, wealth—even <em>light</em>! Just let the human race get back the right over nature that God gave to it, and give it scope; how it is put into practice will be governed by sound reason and true religion.</p><p><strong>130.</strong> The time has come for me to present the art of interpreting nature—the art itself, ·not just remarks about the need for it, its virtues, and so on·. Although I think I have given true and most useful precepts in it, I don’t say that this art is absolutely necessary, implying that nothing could be done without it. In fact, I think that if</p><blockquote>•men had ready at hand a sound history of nature and of experiments, •were thoroughly practised in it, and •imposed on themselves two rules: <strong>(1)</strong> set aside generally accepted opinions and notions, and <strong>(2)</strong> for a while keep your mind away from the highest and second-to-highest generalizations,</blockquote><p>they would arrive at my form of interpretation sheerly through their own natural intelligence, with no help from any other rules or techniques. For interpretation is the true and natural work of the mind when it is freed from blockages. It is true, however, that it can all be done more readily and securely with help from my precepts.</p><p>And I don’t say, either, that my art of interpreting nature is complete so that nothing can be added to it. On the contrary: I am concerned with the mind not only in respect of its own capacities but also in respect of how it engages with things; so I have to think that the art of discovery can develop as more discoveries are made.</p><p><em>The next post in the sequence will be posted Thursday, October 24 at latest by 4:00pm PDT.</em></p>",Francis Bacon,francis-bacon,Francis Bacon,

In the last few months I&apos;ve switched from linking to cross-posting from my blog as LW 2.0 has taken off and proven to be a good host for my content. I could update those old posts with the content just to mirror it over on LW, but that also feels a bit sad because if I&apos;m going to do the (admittedly minor) formatting work necessary to bring the posts over and have them look nice, I&apos;d also like it if they became more visible to folks, especially for that content that I think people would like to see but may have missed because it was linked at a time when LW was pretty inactive and so those old, updated posts wouldn&apos;t well reflect the engagement that might receive now. However, I can also see some danger in this as maybe someone could take this as license to abuse the policy and repost a lot of stuff from years ago to make it fresh again even when it did previously receive appropriate levels of engagement because it was being posted at a time when LW was more active.</p><p>This is obviously mostly a question for the moderators but other people&apos;s opinions are probably worthwhile as evidence for the mods to consider.</p><p>(On an unrelated note, I&apos;d actually be pretty happy to move my blog to LW from Medium, which I know has been floated as a possible future feature, but I&apos;d need some way to keep links working, which is thankfully eased by having a custom domain and not needing to redirect raw Medium articles, as well as a way for my domain to sit in front of my LW content but not all LW content.)</p>",gworley,gordon-seidoh-worley,Gordon Seidoh Worley,

(If you don&apos;t want spoilers, read it first. Probably you should read it first anyway.)</p><p>[Note: while the ideas here are somewhat better than the ideas in the predict-o-matic story, they&apos;re equally rambling, without the crutch of the story to prop them up. As such, I expect readers to be less engaged. Unless you&apos;re especially interested in which character&apos;s remarks are true (or at least, which ones I stand by), this might be a post to skim; I don&apos;t think it has enough coherence that you need to read  it start-to-finish.]</p><p>First, as I mentioned in <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4hdHto3uHejhY2F3Q/partial-agency"">Partial Agency</a>, my main concern here isn&apos;t actually about building safe oracles or inner-aligned systems. My main concern is to understand what&apos;s going on. If we can build guaranteed-myopic systems, that&apos;s good for some purposes. If we can build guaranteed-non-myopic systems, that&apos;s good for other purposes. The story largely frames it as a back-and-forth about whether things will be OK / whether there will be terrible consequences; but my focus was on the more specific questions about the behavior of the system.</p><p>Second, I&apos;m not trying to confidently stand behind any of the character&apos;s views on what will happen. The ending was partly intended to be &quot;and no one got it right, because this stuff is very complicated&quot;. I&apos;m very uncertain about all of this. Part of the reason why it was so much easier to write the post as a story was that I could have characters confidently explain views without worrying about adding all the relevant caveats.</p><h2>Inductive Bias</h2><p>Evan Hubinger pointed out to me that all the characters are talking about asymptotic performance, and ignoring inductive bias. Inner optimizers might emerge due to the inductive bias of the system. I agree; in my mind, the ending was a bit of a hat tip to this, although I hinted at <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/uXH4r6MmKPedk8rMA/gradient-hacking"">gradient hacking</a> rather than inductive bias in the actual text.</p><p>On the other hand, &quot;inductive bias&quot; is a complicated object when you&apos;re talking about a system which isn&apos;t 100% Bayesian.</p><ul><li>You often represent inductive bias through regularization techniques which introduce incentives pulling toward &apos;simpler&apos; models. This means we&apos;re back in the territory of incentives and convergence.</li><li>So, to talk about what a learning algorithm really does, we have to also think of the initialization and search procedure as part of the inductive bias. This makes inductive bias altogether a fairly complicated object.</li></ul><h2>Explicit Fixed-Point Selection</h2><p>The very first conversation involved the intern arguing that there would be multiple valid fixed-points of prediction, and Predict-O-Matic would have to choose between them somehow.</p><p>Explicitly modeling fixed points and choosing between them is a feature of the logical induction algorithm. This feature allows us to select the best one according to some criterion, as is leveraged in <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/KbCHcb8yyjAMFAAPJ/when-wishful-thinking-works"">When Wishful Thinking Works</a>. As discussed later in the conversation with the mathematician, this is atypical of supervised learning algorithms. What logical induction does is very expensive: it solves a computationally difficult fixed-point finding problem (by searching exhaustively).</p><p>Other algorithms are not really &quot;choosing a fixed point somehow&quot;. They&apos;re typically failing to guarantee a fixed point. The mathematician hinted at this by describing how algorithms would not necessarily converge to a self-fulfilling prophecy; they could just as easily go in circles or wander around randomly forever.</p><p>Think of it like fashion. Sometimes, putting a trend into common knowledge will lock it in; this was true about neck ties in business for a long time. In other instances, the popularity of a fashion trend will actually work against it, a fashion statement being ineffective if it&apos;s overdone.</p><p>So, keep in mind that different learning procedures will relate to this aspect of the problem in different ways.</p><h2>Reward vs Prediction Error</h2><p>The economist first compared the learning algorithm to decision markets, then later, decided prediction markets were a better analogy.</p><p>The mathematician contrasted the learning algorithm to reinforcement learning, pointing out that Predict-O-Matic always adjusted outputs to be more like historical observations, whereas reinforcement learning would more strategically optimize reward.</p><p>Both of these point at a distinction between learning general decision-making and something much narrower and much more epistemic in character. As I see it, the critical idea is that (1) the system gets information about what it <em>should have</em> output; (2) the learning update moves toward a modified system which <em>would have</em> output that. This is quite different from reinforcement learning.</p><p>In a <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yAiqLmLFxvyANSfs2/counterfactual-oracles-online-supervised-learning-with"">recent post</a>, Wei Dai mentions a similar distinction (italics added by me):</p><blockquote><strong>Supervised training</strong> - This is safer than reinforcement learning because we don&apos;t have to worry about reward hacking (i.e., reward gaming and reward tampering), and it eliminates the problem of self-confirming predictions (which can be seen as a form of reward hacking). In other words, if <em>the only thing that ever sees the Oracle&apos;s output during a training episode is an automated system that computes the Oracle&apos;s reward/loss, and that system is secure because it&apos;s just computing a simple distance metric (comparing the Oracle&apos;s output to the training label)</em>, then reward hacking and self-confirming predictions can&apos;t happen.</blockquote><p>There are several things going on here, but I think Wei is trying to point at something similar to the distinction I&apos;m thinking of. It&apos;s quite tempting to call it &quot;supervised learning&quot;, because you get a signal telling you what you should have done. However, it&apos;s a bit fuzzy, because this also encompasses things normally called &quot;unsupervised learning&quot;: the supervised/unsupervised distinction is often explained as modeling <span><style>.mjx-chtml {display: inline-block; line-height: 0; text-indent: 0; text-align: left; text-transform: none; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 100%; font-size-adjust: none; letter-spacing: normal; word-wrap: normal; word-spacing: normal; white-space: nowrap; float: none; direction: ltr; max-width: none; max-height: none; min-width: 0; min-height: 0; border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 1px 0}

We simply can&apos;t expect the predictions to be as focused, given the absence of contextual information to help. But that just means it&apos;s a prediction task on which we tend to expect lower accuracy.</p><p> I&apos;m somewhat happy referring to this category as <em><strong>imitative</strong></em> <em><strong>learning</strong></em>. This includes supervised learning, unsupervised learning so long as it&apos;s generative (but not otherwise), and imitation learning (a paradigm which achieves similar ends as inverse reinforcement learning). Homever, the terminological overlap with &apos;imitation learning&apos; is rather terrible, so I&apos;m open to other suggestions.</p><p>It seems to me that this is a critical distinction for the myopia discussion. I hope to say more about it in future posts.</p><h2>Maximizing Entropy?</h2><p>The discussion of prediction markets toward the end was rather loose, in that the economist didn&apos;t deal with a lot of the other points which had been made throughout, and just threw a new model out there.</p><ul><li>The mechanism of manipulation is left quite vague. In an assassination market, there are all kinds of side-channels which agents can use to accomplish their goals. But the rest of the essay had only considered the influence which Predict-O-Matic has by virtue of the predictions it makes. When writing this part, I was actually imagining side-channels, such as exploiting bugs to communicate by other means.</li><li>It&apos;s not clear whether the market is supposed to be myopic or non-myopic in this discussion. The argument for overall myopia was the economist&apos;s initial decision-market model, which is being cast aside here. Are manipulators expected to only throw off individual predictions to reap reward, or are they expected to implement cross-prediction strategies?</li><li>The disanalogy between prediction markets and a local search like gradient descent is swept under the rug. A prediction market has many agents interacting with it, so that one agent can pick up money from another by out-smarting it. Do conclusions from that setting carry over to single-hypothesis learning? It isn&apos;t clear.</li></ul><p>Isnasene <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/SwcyMEgLyd4C3Dern/the-parable-of-predict-o-matic#cQ9NacWHqm6KiFwSq"">interpreted the first point</a> by imagining that the mechanism of manipulation is still through selection of fixed points: </p><blockquote>In the same way that self-fulfilling predictions are good for prediction strategies because they enhance accuracy of the strategy in question, self-fulfilling predictions that seem generally surprising to outside observers are even better because they lower the accuracy of competing strategies. The established prediction strategy thus systematically causes the kinds of events in the world that no other method could predict to further establish itself.</blockquote><p>This is compatible with the assumption of myopia; we might imagine that the system still can&apos;t manipulate events through actual bad predictions, because those strategies will be undercut. Therefore, the manipulation is restricted to selecting fixed-points which are surprising.</p><p>However, there are three problems with this:</p><ul><li>The &quot;undercutting&quot; argument relies on an assumption that there are enough different strategies considered, so that the one which undercuts the non-myopic strategy is eventually found. The argument for strategically increasing entropy relies on the reverse assumption! There&apos;s little profit in increasing entropy if others can predict that you&apos;ll do this and cash in.</li><ul><li>(We might still see both effects at different times in training, however, and therefore expect major consequences of both effects.)</li></ul><li>As previously discussed, we don&apos;t actually expect fixed points in general. So we have to ask whether the entropy-increasing incentive is significant more generally (unless we&apos;re specifically thinking about the logical induction algorithm or other algorithms which get you a fixed point).</li><li>We still have not dealt with the disanalogy between prediction markets and local-search-based learning.</li></ul><p>So, it seems the actual situation is more complicated, and I&apos;m not yet sure how to think about this.</p><h2>&apos;Local Search&apos;; selection vs control</h2><p>I used the term &apos;local search&apos; to describe the application of gradient-descent-like updates to reduce prediction error. I have some conceptual/terminological issues with this.</p><p>Calling this &apos;local search&apos; invokes the mental image of a well-defined gradient landscape which we are taking steps on, to further optimize some function. But this is the wrong mental image. The mental image <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ZDZmopKquzHYPRNxq/selection-vs-control"">is one of selection, when we&apos;re in a control setting</a> (in my terminology). We are not making an iid assumption. We are not getting samples from a stationary but stochastic loss function, as in stochastic gradient descent. </p><p>If &apos;local search&apos; were an appropriate descriptor for gradient-descent here, would it also be an appropriate descriptor for Bayesian updates? There&apos;s a tendency to think of Bayesian learning as trying to find one good hypothesis by tracking how well all of them do (which sounds like a global search), but we needn&apos;t think of it this way. The &quot;right answer&quot; can be a mixture over hypotheses. We can think of a Bayesian update as incrementally improving our mixture. But thinking of Bayesian updates as local search seems wrong. (So does thinking of them as global search.)</p><p>This is online learning. A gradient-descent step represents a prediction that the future will be like the past in some relevant sense, in spite of potential non-stationarity. It is not a guaranteed improvement, even in expectation -- as it would be in offline stochastic gradient descent with sufficiently small step size.</p><p>Moreover, step size becomes a more significant problem. In offline gradient descent, selecting too small a step size only means that you have to make many more steps to get where you&apos;re going. It&apos;s &quot;just a matter of computing power&quot;. In online learning, it&apos;s a more serious problem; we want to make the appropriate-sized update to new data. </p><p>I realize there are more ways of dealing with this than tuning step size; we don&apos;t necessarily update to data by making a single gradient step. But there are problems of principal here.</p><p>What&apos;s gradient descent without a fitness landscape?</p><p>Simply put, gradient descent is a search concept, not a learning concept. I want to be able to think of it more directly as a learning concept. I want to be able to think of it as an &quot;update&quot;, and use terminology which points out the similarity to Bayesian updates.</p><h2>The Duality Remark</h2><p>Vanessa <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/SwcyMEgLyd4C3Dern/the-parable-of-predict-o-matic#gWF3YQ2Z4nTXgmTxa"">asked</a> about this passage:</p><blockquote>The engineer was worse: they were arguing that Predict-O-Matic might maximize prediction error! Some kind of duality principle. Minimizing in one direction means maximizing in the other direction. Whatever that means.</blockquote><p>I responded:</p><blockquote>[I]t was a speculative conjecture which I thought of while writing.</blockquote><blockquote>The idea is that incentivizing agents to lower the error of your predictions (as in a prediction market) looks exactly like incentivizing them to &quot;create&quot; information (find ways of making the world more chaotic), and this is no coincidence. So perhaps there&apos;s a more general principle behind it, where trying to incentivize minimization of f(x,y) only through channel x (eg, only by improving predictions) results in an incentive to maximize f through y, under some additional assumptions. Maybe there is a connection to optimization duality in there.</blockquote><blockquote>In terms of the fictional cannon, I think of it as the engineer trying to convince the boss by simplifying things and making wild but impressive sounding conjectures. :)</blockquote><p>If you have an outer optimizer which is trying to maximize <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""f(x,y)""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.519em; padding-right: 0.06em;"">f</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">(</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">x</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""margin-top: -0.144em; padding-bottom: 0.519em;"">,</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi MJXc-space1""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.519em; padding-right: 0.006em;"">y</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">)</span></span></span></span></span></span> through <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""x""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">x</span></span></span></span></span></span> while being indifferent about <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""y""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.519em; padding-right: 0.006em;"">y</span></span></span></span></span></span>, it seems sensible to suppose that inner optimizers will want to change <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""y""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.519em; padding-right: 0.006em;"">y</span></span></span></span></span></span> to throw things off, particularly if they can get credit for then correcting <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""x""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">x</span></span></span></span></span></span> to be optimal for the new <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""y""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.519em; padding-right: 0.006em;"">y</span></span></span></span></span></span>.

<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/festival-stats-2015"">since</a>


<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/dance-weekend-and-festival-survey"">2014</a>,
I've been sharing counts of how many weekend and festival gigs
different bands and callers have been doing.  Over the course of the
year I collect bookings 

<a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fQq7pTtNVMYVRgOPbjNz2jnyw4RABGrQoplrSQntbn8/edit#gid=1075288908"">in
a big spreadsheet</a>, trying to check each dance weekend's website
about a month before the event when they're likely to have a their
performers listed.



</p><p>

I got into this as kind of a ""market research"" thing for the <a href=""https://www.freeraisins.com/"">Free Raisins</a>: how many
weekends are there?  What are the bands that are getting booked a lot,
so I can go see what they sound like?  Since then I've played a lot
more of these events, and have a better handle on it, but I've kept
the list because having a big pile of data means I have what I need
for posts where I look at <a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/contra-dance-weekend-musician-gender"">the gender distribution
of musicians</a> or <a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/contra-caller-gender-ii"">callers</a>,
make <a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/contra-weekend-heatmap"">heatmaps</a>, or track <a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/when-are-dance-weekends"">when in the year</a> these events
tend to be (which is, not in December, and hence this post
coming out in October and not November).

</p>

<p>

It's also fun to see who's playing a lot each year, and the waves of
bands ramping up and down.  One thing you can't get from this data,
though, is whether this is driven primarily by band interest (reaching
out to weekends to get booked, cutting back to focus on other things)
or organizer interest (booking bands who seem new and hot, avoiding
bands that aren't novel).  Here's what this looks like for the
ten most-booked bands 2014-2019:

</p>

<p>

It's not that clear, but if you know what you're looking for you can
see some of what's going on:

</p>

<p>

</p>

<ul>
<li>Great Bear deciding to retire in 2018 while still very popular.</li>
<li>Buddy System ramping up, first playing techno-contra slots and
growing from there into an excellent acoustic duo.</li>
<li>Wild Asparagus, by far the longest-running band in this group,
maintaining a very steady run.</li>
<li>The Free Raisins playing fewer gigs after I had kids, and then
more fewer gigs because we're not touring anymore.</li>
<li>Elixir first cutting back, and then playing more again with subs</li>
</ul>



<p>

I'm sure there are more stories that this chart could accompany, but I
don't know what's going on with the other bands well enough to tell
them.  (And I'm not sure I have the above ones entirely right either.)

While writing this, I thought of a way in which I think things <strong>could</strong> wrong with dualist Predict-O-Matic, which I plan to post in about a week.  I'm offering a $100 prize to the first commenter who's able to explain how things might go wrong in a sufficiently crisp way before I make my follow-up post.</em></p>
<h1>Dualism</h1>
<p>Currently, machine learning algorithms are essentially ""Cartesian dualists"" when it comes to themselves and their environment.  (Not a philosophy major -- let me know if I'm using that term incorrectly.  But what I mean to say is...)  If I give a machine learning algorithm some data about itself as training data, there's no self-awareness there--it just chugs along looking for patterns like it would for any other problem.  I think it's a reasonable guess that our algorithms will continue to have this ""no self-awareness"" property as they become more and more advanced.  At the very least, this ""business as usual"" scenario seems worth analyzing in depth.</p>
<p>If dualism holds for Abram's prediction AI, the ""Predict-O-Matic"", its world model may happen to include this thing called the Predict-O-Matic which seems to make accurate predictions -- but it's not special in any way and isn't being modeled any differently than anything else in the world.  Again, I think this is a pretty reasonable guess for the Predict-O-Matic's <em>default</em> behavior.  I suspect other behavior would require special code which attempts to pinpoint the Predict-O-Matic in its own world model and give it special treatment (an ""ego"").</p>
<p>Let's suppose the Predict-O-Matic follows a ""recursive uncertainty decomposition"" strategy for making predictions about the world.  It models the entire world in rather fuzzy resolution, mostly to know what's important for any given prediction.  If some aspect of the world appears especially relevant to a prediction it's trying to make, it ""zooms in"" and tries to model that thing in higher resolution.  And if some part of <em>that</em> thing seems especially relevant, it zooms in further on <em>that</em> part.  Etc.</p>
<p>Now suppose the Predict-O-Matic is trying to make a prediction, and its ""recursive uncertainty decomposition"" algorithms say the next prediction made by this Predict-O-Matic thing which happens to occupy its world model appears especially relevant!  What then?</p>
<p>At this point, the Predict-O-Matic has stepped into a hall of mirrors.  To predict the next prediction made by the Predict-O-Matic in its world model, the Predict-O-Matic needs to run an internal simulation of that Predict-O-Matic.  But as it runs that simulation, it finds that simulation kicking off another Predict-O-Matic simulation in the <em>simulated</em> Predict-O-Matic's world model!  Etc, etc.</p>
<p>So if the Predict-O-Matic is implemented naively, the result could just be an infinite recurse.  Not useful, but not necessarily dangerous either.</p>
<p>Let's suppose the Predict-O-Matic has a non-naive implementation and something prevents this infinite recurse.  For example, there's a monitor process that notices when a model is eating up a lot of computation without delivering useful results, and replaces that model with one which is lower-resolution.  Or maybe the Predict-O-Matic <em>does</em> have a naive implementation, but it doesn't have enough data about itself to model itself in much detail, so it ends up using a low-resolution model.</p>
<p>One possibility is that it's able to find a useful outside view model such as ""the Predict-O-Matic has a history of making negative self-fulfilling prophecies"".  This could lead to the Predict-O-Matic making a negative prophecy (""the Predict-O-Matic will continue to make negative prophecies which result in terrible outcomes""), but this prophecy wouldn't be selected for being self-fulfilling.  And we might usefully ask the Predict-O-Matic whether the terrible self-fulfilling prophecies will continue conditional on us taking Action A.</p>
<h1>Answering a Question by Having the Answer</h1>
<p>If you aren't already convinced, here's another explanation for why I don't think the Predict-O-Matic will make self-fulfilling prophecies by default.</p>
<p>In Abram's story, the engineer says: ""The answer to a question isn't really separate from the expected observation. So 'probability of observation depending on that prediction' would translate to 'probability of an event given that event', which just has to be one.""</p>
<p>In other words, if the Predict-O-Matic knows it will predict P = A, it assigns probability 1 to the proposition that it will predict P = A.</p>
<p>I contend that Predict-O-Matic doesn't know it will predict P = A at the relevant time.  It would require time travel -- to know whether it will predict P = A, it will have to have made a prediction already, and but it's still formulating its prediction as it thinks about what it will predict.</p>
<p>More details: Let's taboo ""Predict-O-Matic"" and instead talk about a ""predictive model"" and ""input data"".  The trick is to avoid including the output of the predictive model in the model's input data.  This isn't possible the first time we make a prediction because it would require time travel -- so as a practical matter, we don't want to re-run the model a second time with the prediction from its first run included in the input data.  Let's say the dataset is kept completely static during prediction.  (I offer no guarantees in the case where observational data about the model's prediction process is being used to inform the model <em>while</em> it makes a prediction!)</p>
<p>To clarify further, let's consider a non-Predict-O-Matic scenario where issues <em>do</em> crop up.  Suppose I'm a big shot stock analyst.  I think Acme Corp's stock is overvalued and will continue to be overvalued in one month's time.  But before announcing my prediction, I do a sanity check.  I notice that if I announce my opinion, that could cause investors to dump Acme, and Acme will likely no longer be overvalued in one month's time.  So I veto the column I was planning to write on Acme, and instead search for a column <code>c</code> I can write such that <code>c</code> is a fixed point for the world <code>w</code> -- <code>w(c) = c</code> -- even when the world is given my column as an input, what I predicted in my column still comes true.</p>
<p>Note again that the sanity check which leads to a search for a fixed point doesn't happen by default -- it requires some extra functionality, beyond what's required for naive prediction, to implement.  The Predict-O-Matic doesn't care about looking bad, and there's nothing contradictory about it predicting that it won't make the very prediction it makes, or something like that.  Predictive model, meet input data.  That's what it does.</p>
<h1>Open Questions</h1>
<p>This is a section for half-baked thoughts that could grow into a counterargument for what I wrote above.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What's going on when you try to model yourself thinking about the answer to this question?  (Why is this question so hard to think about?  Maybe my brain has a mechanism to prevent infinite recurse?  Tangent: I wonder if <a href=""www.lesswrong.com/posts/buixYfcXBah9hbSNZ/we-change-our-minds-less-often-than-we-think"">this</a> is evidence of a mechanism that tries to prevent my brain from making premature predictions by observing data about my own predictive process while trying to make predictions?  Otherwise maybe there could be a cascade of updates where noticing that I've become more sure of something makes me even more sure of it, etc.  By the way, I think maybe humans do this on a group level, and this accounts for intellectual fashions.)  Anyway, I think it's important to understand if my brain does something ""in practice"" which differs from what I've outlined here, some kind of method for collapsing recursion that a sufficiently advanced Predict-O-Matic might use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What if the Predict-O-Matic assigns some credence to the idea that it's ""agentic"" in nature?  Then what if the Predict-O-Matic assigns some credence to the idea that the simulated version of itself could assign credence to the idea that it's in a simulation?  (I think this is just a classic daemon but maybe it differs in important ways?)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In ML, the predictive model isn't trying to maximize its own accuracy--that's what the training algorithm tries to do.  The predictive model doesn't seem like an optimizer even in the ""mathematical optimization"" sense of the world optimization (is ""mesa-optimizer"" an appropriate term?  In this case, I think we're <em>glad</em> it's a mesa-optimizer?)  What if the Predict-O-Matic sometimes runs a training algorithm to update its model?  How does that change things?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What if time travel actually is possible and we just haven't discovered it yet?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does anything interesting happen if the Predict-O-Matic becomes aware of the concept of self-awareness?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Could the Predict-O-Matic notice and exploit shared computational structure in the recursive self-simulation process?  Suppose it notes the computation it has to do to make a prediction for the simulated Predict-O-Matic is similar to the computation it has to do to just make a prediction!  What then?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Prize Details</h1>
<p>Again, $100 prize for the first comment which crisply explains something that could wrong with dualist Predict-O-Matic.  Contest ends when I publish my follow-up -- probably next Wednesday the 23rd.  I do have at least one answer in mind but I'm hoping you'll come up with something I haven't thought of.  However, if I'm not convinced your thing would be a problem, I can't promise you a prize.  No comment on whether ""Open Questions"" are related to the answer I have in mind.</p>

It&#x2019;s physical and literal. (sometimes called the gross world)<br></p><p>The subtle is the world that sits on top of that. Things like emotion and goodness or the felt/body sense of things.&#xA0; If I&#x2019;m having a &#x201C;good day&#x201D; technically that&#x2019;s in the atom world, but practically when it&#x2019;s described its not literal, nor is it always touchable from inside one mind to another (my good day is lightly transferable to you but I can&#x2019;t force you to take my good day).<br></p><p>The causal realm, (yes they are more like &#x201C;realms&#x201D; than &#x201C;worlds&#x201D;) (sometimes called the very subtle). Is described as the place where other realms come from phenomenologically. Where thoughts come from. When I remember where I put the keys, that&#x2019;s a potentially generative thought that seems to arise from nowhere. It&#x2019;s causal in that it can cause me to go &#x201C;aha!&#x201D; (subtle emotional experience) and get the keys (concrete action), but when talking about the causal we are definitely talking about something different from the atom world.<br></p><p>Ideas and concepts exist in a causal sense and map down to the atom world. (although the way people use causal can sometimes vary and there&#x2019;s endless debates on it).&#xA0; As subjective categories they are a bit variable. There&#x2019;s also the edge where some experiences happen at the edge. A particular way of breathing might be more like an emotion than a concrete despite being both.<br></p><p>I was talking to a friend about money. And I noticed that trading money feels very odd. It always has, transactions feel strange.&#xA0; All my life transactions have been this odd little awkward dance of retrieving the cash, handing over the cash and receiving the change.&#xA0; There&#x2019;s a little bit of social interaction in the process but it&#x2019;s a bit more odd too.<br></p><p>My friend talked about a skill swap where the feeling of the trade felt more right and they enjoyed the experience much more because it felt like both sides were giving from the emotional part of themselves.<br></p><p>When I make a financial trade it seems to have a concrete realm swap of coinage but does not carry the subtle &#x201C;made with love&#x201D; every time. It&#x2019;s just coins. Or at least I don&#x2019;t ever think about it when I pay for something or get paid. All the ways the currency had changed hands on the way through me to the rest of the economy.<br></p><p>We talked about buying a loaf of bread and the bread having much more of a subtle and causal than the money. It could have been made with love, as I eat it, it sustains me for extended periods of time and some of those atoms might be here the rest of my life, helping me to generate future ideas and create more value in the world.<br></p><p>So here&#x2019;s my concept &#x2013; I don&#x2019;t notice money having a subtle layer to my experience. It&#x2019;s just this dull thing to me.

<p><a href=""https://acesounderglass.com/tag/epistemicspotcheck/"">Epistemic spot checks</a> are a series in which I select claims from the first few chapters of a book and investigate them for accuracy, to determine if a book is worth my time. This month’s subject is <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0192807285/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=acesoundergla-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0192807285&amp;linkId=59848586d3ab9cc67fb05e06eebbb8c7""><i>The Fall of Rome</i></a>, by Bryan Ward-Perkins, which advocates for the view that Rome fell, and it was probably a military problem.</p>
<p>Like August’s <a href=""https://acesounderglass.com/2019/08/22/epistemic-spot-check-the-fate-of-rome-kyle-harper/""><i>The Fate of Rome</i></a>, this spot check was done as part of a collaboration with <a href=""https://parallelforecast.com/"">Parallel Forecasting</a> and <a href=""https://www.foretold.io/"">Foretold</a>, which means that instead of resolving a claim as true or false, I give a confidence distribution of what I think I would answer if I spent 10 hours on the question (in reality I spent 10-45 minutes per question). Sometimes the claim is a question with a numerical answer, sometimes it is just a statement and I state how likely I think the statement is to be true.</p>
<p>This spot check is subject to the same constraints as <i>The Fate of Rome</i>, including:</p>
<ol>
<li>Some of my answers include research from the forecasters, not just my own.</li>
<li>Due to our procedure for choosing questions, I didn’t investigate all the claims I would have liked to.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Claims</h1>
<p><b><i>Claim made by the text:</i></b><i>  “[Emperor Valerian] spent the final years of his life as a captive at the Persian Court”<br />
</i><b><i>Question I answered</i></b><i>: what is the chance that is true?<br />
</i><b><i>My answer</i></b><i>: I estimate a chance of (99 – 3*lognormal(0,1)) that Emperor Valerian was captured by the Persians and spent multiple years as a prisoner before dying in captivity.</i></p>
<p>You don’t even have to click on the Wikipedia page to confirm this is the common story: it’s in the google preview for “emperor valerian”. So the only question is the chance that all of history got this wrong. Wikipedia lists five primary sources, of which I verified three.  <a href=""https://www.ancient-origins.net/history/what-really-happened-valerian-was-roman-emperor-humiliated-and-skinned-hands-enemy-008598"">https://www.ancient-origins.net/history/what-really-happened-valerian-was-roman-emperor-humiliated-and-skinned-hands-enemy-008598</a> raises questions about how badly Valerian was treated, but not that he was captive.</p>
<p>My only qualm is the chance that this could be a lie perpetuated at the time. Maybe Valerian died and the Persians used a double, maybe something weirder happened. System 2 says the chance of this is &lt; 10% but gut says &lt; 15%.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b><i>Claim made by the text:</i></b><i> “What had totally disappeared, however, were the good-quality, low-value items, made in bulk, and available so widely in the Roman period”<br />
</i><b><i>Question I answered</i></b><i>: What is the chance mass-produced, low-value items available so widely in the Roman period, disappear in Britain by 600 AD?<br />
</i><b><i>My answer</i></b><i>: I estimate a chance of (64 to 93, normal distribution) that mass-produced, low-value items were available in Britain during Roman rule and not after 600 AD.</i></p>
<p>This was one of the hardest claims to investigate, because it represents original research by Ward-Perkins. I had basically given up on answering this without a pottery PhD until google suggestions gave me the perfect article.</p>
<p>This is actually a compound claim by Ward-Perkins: </p>
<ol>
<li>Roman coinage and mass-produced, low-cost, high-quality pottery disappeared from Britain and then the rest of post-Roman Europe.</li>
<li>The state of pottery and coinage is a good proxy for the state of goods and trades as a whole, because they preserve so amazingly well and are relatively easy to date.</li>
</ol>
<p>Data points:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""https://brewminate.com/the-perils-of-periodization-roman-ceramics-in-britain-after-400-ce/"">https://brewminate.com/the-perils-of-periodization-roman-ceramics-in-britain-after-400-ce/</a> Cites exactly the pattern Ward-Perkins describes in pottery and coins, citing Ward-Perkins and 4 other source I couldn’t verify. This seems like very strong confirmation of W-P’s hypothesis. However it leaves open the chance that this is an area of contention, of which W-P and brewminate happen to be on the same side. Brewminate’s main focus is not on the British empire, but on pottery in the gap between the Roman’s and the Anglo-Saxons. I estimate that would bias them towards increasing the size of the discontinuity between Roman and post-Roman Britain.</li>

<li><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Roman-Pottery-Interpreting-Kevin-Greene/dp/0520080319"">Roman Pottery by Kevin Greene</a> establishes approximately the same thing, and was found independently of brewminate.</li>

<li><a href=""https://www.thegreatcoursesdaily.com/britain-after-the-romans-left/"">https://www.thegreatcoursesdaily.com/britain-after-the-romans-left/</a> (I think a very mainstream source) repeats the story that pottery is informative and pottery shows a decline after 400s.</li>
<li>Searching for “the fall of rome ward-perkins criticism” turns up nothing interesting in the first two pages.</li>
<li>Searched for “late antiquity british pottery” found nothing. “late antiquity” is the term for the narrative that Rome didn’t fall, it just transformed, and is what Ward-Perkins is directly arguing against, so I’d expect criticism of him to be coded with that term.</li>

</ul>
<p>If we believe Ward-Perkins and Brewminate, I estimate the chances that pottery massively declined at 95-99,  times 80-95 that other good declined with them. There remains the chances that the historical record is massively misleading (very unlikely with pots, although I don’t know how likely it is to have missed sites entirely), and that W-P et al are misinterpreting the record. I would be very surprised if so many sites had been missed as to invalidate this data, call it 5-15%. Gut feeling, 5-20% chance the W-P crowd are exaggerating the data, but given the absence of challenges, not higher than that and not a significant chance they’re just making shit up.</p>
<p>(95 to 99)*(85 to 95) * (80 to 95) = 64 to 93%</p>

<p> </p>
<p>The highest estimate of literacy in Roman Empire I found is 30%.  Call it twice that for ability to read at a 1st grade level in cities. So the range is 5%-60%. </p>
<p>The absolute lowest the European 1000AD literacy rate could be is 0; the highest estimate is 5% (and that was in the 1300s, which were probably more literate).  From the absence of graffiti I infer that even minimal literacy achievement dropped a great deal. </p>
<p>Maximum = 60%-1% = 59%<br />

<p><b><i>Claim made by the text: </i></b><i>“What some people describe as “the invasion of Rome by Germanic barbarians”, Walter Goffart describes as “the Romans incorporating the Germanic tribes into their citizenry and setting them up as rulers who reported to the empire.” and “Rome did fall, but only because it had voluntarily delegated its own power, not because it had been successfully invaded”.”<br />

<ul>
<li>Peter Heather: The most influential statement of this, perhaps, is Walter Goffart’s brilliant aphorism that the fall of the Western Empire was just ‘an imaginative experiment that got a little out of hand’. Goffart means that changes in Roman policy towards the barbarians led to the emergence of the successor states, dependant on barbarian military power and incorporating Roman institutions, and that the process which brought this out was not a particularly violent one.</li>

<li>“Despite intermittent turbulence and destruction, much of the Roman West came under barbarian control in an orderly fashion. Goths, Burgundians, and other aliens were accommodated within the provinces without disrupting the settled population or overturning the patterns of landownership. Walter Goffart examines these arrangements and shows that they were based on the procedures of Roman taxation, rather than on those of military billeting (the so-called <i>hospitalitas</i> system), as has long been thought. Resident proprietors could be left in undisturbed possession of their lands because the proceeds of taxation,rather than land itself, were awarded to the barbarian troops and their leaders.”</li>

<ul>
<li>“the barbarians and Rome, instead of being in constant conflict with each other, occupied a joined space, a single world in which both were entitled to share. What we call the barbarian invasions was primarily a drawing of foreigners into Roman service, a process sponsored, encouraged, and rewarded by Rome. Simultaneously, the Romans energetically upheld their supremacy. Many barbarian peoples were suppressed and vanished; the survivors were persuaded and learned to shoulder Roman tasks. Rome was never discredited or repudiated. The future endorsed and carried forward what the Empire stood for in religion, law, administration, literacy, and language.”</li>

But suggests its main problem was constantinople, not interactions with barbarians at all. So top percentage correct = 90%)</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>This seems pretty conclusive that Goffart thought Barbarians were accommodated rather than conquered the area (so my minimum estimate that the summary was correct must be greater than 50%). However it’s not clear how much power he thought they took, or whether rome fell at all. This could be a poor restatement, or it could be that if I read Goffart’s actual work and not just book jacket blurbs I’d agree.</p>

</i><b><i>My answer: </i></b><i>There is a (91-99%, normal distribution) chance I would recommend this to a friend.</i></p>
<p>99% is in range, because I definitely think it’s worth reading if they’re interested in the topic. I think I’d recommend it before Fate of Rome, because it establishes that rome fell more concretely.</p>
<p>Is there a chance I wouldn’t recommend it?</p>
<ul>
<li>They could have already read it</li>
<li>They could be more interested in disease and climate change (in which case I’d recommend Fate)</li>
<li>I could forget about it</li>
<li>I could not want to take responsibility for their reading.</li>
<li>I could be unconfident that Fall was better than what they’d find by chance.
<ul>
<li>This feels like the biggest one.</li>
<li>But the question doesn’t say “best book”, it just says “reliable source”</li>
<li>Only real qualm on that is that is normal history book qualms</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So the minimum is 91%</p>
<p> </p>
<h1>Bonus Claims</h1>
<p>These are the claims I didn’t check, but other people made predictions on how I would guess. Note that at this point the predictions haven’t been very accurate- whether they’re net positive depends on how you weight the questions. And Foretold is beta software that hasn’t prioritized export yet, so I’m using *shudder* screen shots. But for the sake of completeness:</p>
<p><b><i>Claim made by the text: </i></b>The Fall of Rome: Roman Pottery pre-400AD was high quality and uniform.<br />
<b><i>Predicted answer:</i></b> 29.9% to 63.5% chance this claim is correct</p>
<p><b><i>Claim made by the text: </i></b>“In Britain new coins ceased to reach the island, except in tiny quantities, at the beginning of the fifth century”<br />
<b><i>Predicted answer:</i></b> 31.6% to 94% chance this claim is correct</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b><i>Claim made by the text: </i></b>The Fall of Rome: [average German soldiers’ height] – [average Roman soldiers’ height] = N feet. What is N? .<br />
<b><i>Predicted answer:</i></b> -0.107 to 0.61 ft.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b><i>Claim made by the text:</i></b> The Romans chose to cede local control of Gaul to the Germanic tribes in the 400s, as opposed to losing them in a military conquest.<br />
<b><i>Predicted answer:</i></b> 28.5% to 85.6% chance this claim is correct</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b><i>Claim made by the text:</i></b> The Germanic tribes who took over local control of Gaul in the 400s reported to the Emperor.<br />
<b><i>Predicted answer:</i></b> 4.77% to 50.9% chance this claim is correct</p>
<p> </p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p><i>The Fall of Rome</i> did very well on spot-checking- no outright disagreements at all, just some uncertainties. </p>
<p>On the other hand, <i>The Fall of Rome</i> barely mentions disease and doesn’t mention climate change at all, which my previous book, <a href=""https://acesounderglass.com/2019/08/22/epistemic-spot-check-the-fate-of-rome-kyle-harper/""><i>The Fate of Rome</i></a>, claimed to be the main causes of the fall. <i>The Fate of Rome</i> did almost as well in epistemic spot checking as <i>Fall</i>, yet they can’t both be correct. What’s going on? I’m going to address that in a separate post, because I want to be able to link to it without forcing people to read this entire spot check.</p>
<p>In terms of readability, <i>Fall</i> starts slowly but the second half is by far the most interested I have ever been in pottery or archeology.</p>

wCwii4QMA79GmyKz5,Introducing Foretold.io: A New Open-Source Prediction Registry,introducing-foretold-io-a-new-open-source-prediction,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/wCwii4QMA79GmyKz5/introducing-foretold-io-a-new-open-source-prediction,2019-10-16T14:23:47.229Z,79,29,10,False,False,,"<p>I’m happy to announce a semi-public beta of <a href=""https://www.foretold.io/login"">Foretold.io</a> for the EA/LessWrong community. I’ve spent much of the last year working on coding &amp; development, with lots of help by terraform on product and scoring design. Special thanks to the <a href=""https://app.effectivealtruism.org/funds/far-future"">Long-Term Future Fund</a> and its donors, who’s contribution to the project helped us to hire contractors to do much of the engineering &amp; design.</p>
<p>You can use <a href=""https://www.foretold.io/login"">Foretold.io</a> right away by following <a href=""https://www.foretold.io/login"">this link</a>. Currently public activity is only shown to logged in users, but I expect that to be opened up over the next few weeks. There are currently only a few public communities of predictable questions, but that will change over time.</p>
<h2>The Main Concept</h2>
<p>We aim for <a href=""https://www.foretold.io/login"">Foretold.io</a> to be useful as a general-purpose prediction registry, with the potential to be used for more specific prediction purposes.</p>
<p>The main features of a prediction registry include things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>People can specify questions to be predicted</li>
<li>Forecasters can predict those questions</li>
<li>Questions can either be resolved with answers or cancelled</li>
<li>After questions are resolved, forecasters are scored on meaningful metrics</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the essentials, we focused on some other useful features including:</p>
<p><strong>Full distribution forecasts for continuous variables</strong><br>
In <a href=""https://www.foretold.io/login"">Foretold.io</a>, variables are estimated with arbitrary probability distributions. Most existing forecasting tools only allow for binary and categorical binary questions, or relatively simple distributions. <a href=""https://www.foretold.io/login"">Foretold.io</a> saves arbitrary cumulative density functions. The <a href=""https://observablehq.com/@oagr/foretold-inputs"">main input editor</a> is a fork of that in <a href=""https://www.getguesstimate.com/"">Guesstimate</a>. We plan to add more input methods in the future.</p>
<p><strong>“Communities” with custom privacy settings</strong><br>
<a href=""https://www.foretold.io/login"">Foretold.io</a> allows for groups to collaborate on forecasting different sets of questions. Communities can be public or private, and question creators can easily move their questions between communities. I’ve talked to several Effective Altruist organizations that have internal forecasting setups, but almost all use in-house solutions with Google Docs. One of the main bottlenecks seems to be easy private community support.</p>
<p><strong>A GraphQL API, with support for bots</strong><br>
Users can create bots that get scored individually. They can use the same GraphQL API that the <a href=""https://www.foretold.io/login"">Foretold.io</a> client uses. You can see information about how to use the API <a href=""https://observablehq.com/@jjj/bot-tips"">here</a>. This part is still early, but will continue to improve.</p>
<p>In the future we hope that the API will be used to do things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make forecasts</li>
<li>Make &amp; resolve questions</li>
<li>Automate the setup of new prediction experiments</li>
<li>Make dashboards of useful forecasts</li>
</ul>
<h2>Intended Uses</h2>
<p>Similar to Guesstimate, <a href=""https://www.foretold.io/login"">Foretold.io</a> itself is not domain-specific. It could be used in multiple kinds of setups; for instance, for personal use, group use, or for a sizable open prediction tournament. Hopefully over the coming years we’ll identify which specific uses and setups are the most promising and optimize accordingly.</p>
<p>Recently it’s been used for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Various personal/individual questions</li>
<li>Internal group predictions at FHI</li>
<li>A currently-open tournament on predicting the upcoming EA survey responses</li>
<li>A few small forecasting experiments</li>
</ul>
<p>We encourage broad experimentation. Feel free to make as many public &amp; private communities as you like for different purposes. If you'd be interested in discussing possible details, please reach out.</p>
<h2>Questions</h2>
<p><strong>I’m interested in performing an experiment that could use the tracking of probability distributions. Can I use <a href=""http://Foretold.io"">Foretold.io</a>?</strong><br>
Yes! <a href=""https://www.foretold.io/login"">Foretold.io</a> is open-source, and we’re very happy to give special support to researchers and similar interested in working with probability distributions and/or forecasts. It’s made to be reasonably general-purpose and extendable via the API.</p>
<p>To get started, simply create a community on <a href=""https://www.foretold.io/login"">Foretold.io</a> and make a few questions. If you prefer, you can also <a href=""https://github.com/foretold-app/foretold"">fork the codebase</a> and run the app separately.</p>
<p><strong>Are you coordinating with other forecasting projects?</strong><br>
In the last few years several efforts and research projects around “forecasting” have emerged, specifically around AI. Most of these are focused on domain-specific research, rather than technical infrastructure. I have been talking with several of the other groups, and have been working particularly closely with Ben Goldhaber of <a href=""http://parallelforecast.com/"">Parallel Forecast</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Why not just partner with an existing technical forecasting registry and add features to that?</strong><br>
In general, I’ve found that it’s really hard to join a group and get them to dramatically change their priorities. Many of the new additions in <a href=""https://www.foretold.io/login"">Foretold.io</a> are pretty significant, and the roadmap is ambitious.</p>
<p><strong>Is there any connection between <a href=""http://Foretold.io"">Foretold.io</a> and Guesstimate?</strong><br>
<a href=""https://www.foretold.io/login"">Foretold.io</a> uses a fork of the distribution editor from Guesstimate. The distribution syntax is the same (“5 to 20”). In the future we plan to make it easy to import <a href=""https://www.foretold.io/login"">Foretold.io</a> variables into Guesstimate, and to use Guesstimate variables for predictions in <a href=""https://www.foretold.io/login"">Foretold.io</a>.</p>
<h2>Details</h2>
<p><strong>Technical details</strong><br>
<a href=""https://www.foretold.io/login"">Foretold.io</a> uses Node.js and Express.js with Apollo for the GraphQL server, and ReasonML and React for the client. The database is PostgreSQL. The application is currently hosted on Heroku.</p>
<p><strong>Funding</strong><br>
The project has raised $90,000 from the <a href=""https://app.effectivealtruism.org/funds/far-future"">Long-Term Future Fund</a>. Around $25,000 of that has been spent so far, mostly on programming and design help.</p>
<p><strong>Ownership</strong><br>
<a href=""https://www.foretold.io/login"">Foretold.io</a> is <a href=""https://github.com/foretold-app/foretold"">open source</a>. In the future, I intend for it to be supported via a nonprofit.</p>
<p><strong>Get Involved</strong><br>
<a href=""https://www.foretold.io/login"">Foretold.io</a> is free &amp; open to use of all (legal) kinds. That said, if you intend to make serious use of the API, please let me know beforehand.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in collaborating on either the platform, formal experiments, or related research, please reach out to me, either via private message or email (<a href=""mailto:ozzieagooen@gmail.com"">ozzieagooen@gmail.com</a>). I’m particularly looking for engineers and people who want to set up forecasting tournaments on important topics.</p>

We used to make land.  We built long wharves for docking ships, and
then over time filled in the areas between them.  Later we built up
mudflats wholesale to make even larger areas.  Here's a map of Boston
showing how much of the land wasn't previously dry:



</p><p>

<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/boston-made-land-big.jpg""><img src=""https://www.jefftk.com/boston-made-land.jpg"" /></a>
<br />
(<i><a href=""https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:q524n430n"">Map
reproduction courtesy of the Norman B. Leventhal Map &amp; Education
Center at the Boston Public Library</a></i>)

</p>

<p>

In expensive areas, converting wetlands and shallow water into usable
land is a very good thing on balance, and we should start doing it
again.  To take a specific example, we should make land out of the San
Francisco Bay, at least South of the Dumbarton Bridge:

</p>

<p>

<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/fill-in-bay-south-of-dumbarton-big.png""><img src=""https://www.jefftk.com/fill-in-bay-south-of-dumbarton.png"" /></a>

</p>

<p>

This is about 50mi2, a bit bigger than San Fransisco.  This would be
enough new central land to <a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/rent-needs-to-decrease"">bring
rents down dramatically across the region</a>.  It can be built to a
higher density than SF, because no one is having their neighborhood
Manhattanized.  Millions of people could live there.

</p>

<p>

So, ok, let's address some likely objections:

</p>

<p>

<i>This would be an environmental disaster.  Some of that area is a
wildlife refuge, and all of it should be protected.</i>

</p>

<p>

The world is very large, and cities are a very small portion of it.
The land we set aside for animals should be outside of cities, where
far more land is available at far less impact to people.

</p>

<p>

Sprawl has a much larger impact on wildlife than infill, and allowing
people to live closer in is the most powerful way to address sprawl.
Additionally, sprawl leads to much higher carbon emissions through
less efficient transportation.  While development of the Bay would be
harmful to the specific animals that live there today, it would be
better for animals (and people) overall.

</p>

<p>

<i>The Bay is beautiful and this would ruin it.</i>

</p>

<p>

This part of the Bay is primarily industrial salt ponds.

</p>

<p>

<i>This is just a few miles from a major fault line, and made land
can liquify in earthquakes.</i>

</p>

<p>

You do need to take fill into account to build in an earthquake-safe
way, but modern engineering is well up to the task.

</p>

<p>

<i>Traffic would be even worse.</i>

</p>

<p>

The biggest contribution to traffic in the Bay Area is that people
aren't allowed to live where the jobs are.  The second biggest is that
BART doesn't have enough coverage to make <a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/transportation-tracking"">living without a car</a> practical
in most of the area.  This would help with both of these, since this
project would allow millions of people to live closer in and would
easily fund massive subway expansion.

</p>

<p>

<i>Wait, how many people are you saying would live there?</i>

</p>

<p>

Here's SF's density in the 2010 census:

</p>

<p>

<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/sf-current-population-density-big.png""><img src=""https://www.jefftk.com/sf-current-population-density.png"" /></a>

</p>

<p>

Relatively dense portions of the city have a density of ~40k people
per square mile, which would be ~2M people over this 50mi2 area.  At a
density of ~80k people per square mile, something like NYC's <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Village,_Manhattan"">East
Village</a>, this could be ~4M people.  Much higher densities are <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kowloon_Walled_City"">possible</a>
but not a good idea.

</p>

<p>

<i>This would undo decades of work aimed at preserving the Bay and
restoring its wetlands.</i>

</p>

<p>

Yes.

</p>

<p>

<i>Sea-level rise means we shouldn't be building more in low-lying areas.</i>

</p>

<p>

Building dikes to keep the water out is very practical.  A third of
the Netherlands is below sea level, with most of that expansion
happening before modern technology.  By decreasing the amount of
coastline in the Bay this project would make it easier to prevent
flooding caused by sea-level rise.

</p>

<p>

<i>Didn't someone already propose this decades ago?</i>

</p>

<p>

The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reber_Plan"">Reber Plan</a>
of the 1940s was a similar large project planned farther North,
primarily for the East Bay.  It was intended to both make land and
create freshwater lakes, and testing with a scale-model showed major
issues.  This plan is much simpler, and more similar to past
successful land reclamation projects.

</p>

<p>

<i>There's not enough water for the people we already have; what will
people drink?</i>

</p>

<p>

There's plenty of water already, we just need to prioritize people
drinking it over crops, which would happen naturally if we priced it.
But even without that, desalination is cheap enough that a person's
daily water use would be <a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/californians-wont-go-thirsty"">a
matter of cents</a>.

</p>

<p>

<i>Is this a serious proposal?</i>

</p>

<p>

Yes.  We should do this.

</p>

<p>

(I previously suggested this kind of infill development with Boston's
<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/fill-in-fort-point-channel"">Fort Point Channel</a>.)

<p>This post will present a simple agent with contradictory and <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/KCg7NeKQ7MycXWpYd/our-values-are-underdefined-changeable-and-manipulable"">underdefined</a> ""preferences"", and will apply the procedure detailed <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CSEdLLEkap2pubjof/research-agenda-v0-9-synthesising-a-human-s-preferences-into"">in this research project</a> to capture all these preferences (and meta-preferences) in a single utility function<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-hRwXzkF2RnXjjZnCN-1"" id=""fnref-hRwXzkF2RnXjjZnCN-1"">[1]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The toy model will start in a simpler form, and gradually add more details, aiming to capture almost all of sections 2 and 3 of the <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CSEdLLEkap2pubjof/research-agenda-v0-9-synthesising-a-human-s-preferences-into"">research agenda</a> in a single place.</p>
<p>The purposes of this toy model are:</p>
<ol>
<li>To illustrate the research agenda in ways that are easier to grasp.</li>
<li>To figure out where the research agenda works well and where it doesn't (for example, working through this example suggests to me that there may be a cleaner way of combining partial preference than the one <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ucG63yw3JgP3rW7tH/toy-model-piece-5-combining-partial-preferences"">detailed here</a>).</li>
<li>To allow other people to criticism the toy model (and through it, the research agenda) in useful ways.</li>
<li>And, thus, ultimately to improve the whole research agenda.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, the best critiques are ones that increase the clarity of the toy model, those that object to specific parts of it (especially if alternatives are suggested), and those that make it more realistic for applying to actual humans.</p>
<h2>1.1 How much to read this post</h2>
<p>On a first pass, I'd recommend reading up to the end of Section 3, which synthesises all the base level preferences. Then Sections 4, 5, and 6 deal with more advanced aspects, such as meta-preferences and identity preferences. Finally, sections 7 and 8 are more speculative and underdefined, and deal with situations where the definitions become more ambiguous.</p>
<h1>2. The basic setting and the basic agent</h1>
<p>Ideally, the toy example would start with some actual agent that exists in the machine learning literature; an agent which uses multiple overlapping and slightly contradictory models. However, I haven't been able to find a good example of such an agent, especially not one that is sufficiently transparent and interpretable for this toy example.</p>
<p>So I'll start by giving the setting and the agent myself; hopefully, this will get replaced by another ML agent in future iterations, but it serves as a good starting point.</p>
<h2>2.1 The blegg and rube classifier</h2>
<p>The agent is a robot that is tasked with sorting <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yA4gF5KrboK2m2Xu7/how-an-algorithm-feels-from-inside"">bleggs and rubes</a>.</p>
<p><img src=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/n163r741oej2001/blegg_rube_room_day.png?raw=1"" alt=""""></p>
<p>Time is divided into discrete timesteps, of which there will be a thousand in total. The robot is in a room, with a conveyor belt and four bins. Bleggs (blue eggs) and rubes (red cubes) periodically appear on the conveyor belt. The conveyor belt moves right by one square every timestep, moving these objects with it (and taking them out of the room forever if they're on the right of the conveyor belt).</p>
<p>The possible actions of the robot are as follows: move in the four directions around it<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-hRwXzkF2RnXjjZnCN-2"" id=""fnref-hRwXzkF2RnXjjZnCN-2"">[2]</a></sup>, pick up any small object (eg a blegg or a rube) from the four directions around it (it can only do so if it isn't currently carrying anything), or drop a small object in any of the four directions around it. Only one small object can occupy any given floorsquare; if the robot enters an occupied square, it crushes any object in it. Note that the details of these dynamics shouldn't be that important, but I'm writing them down for full clarity.</p>
<h2>2.2 The partial preferences</h2>
<p>The robot has many <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/2vnJmWDAaLKDayvwr/toy-model-piece-4-partial-preferences-re-re-visited"">partial models</a> appropriate for many circumstances. I am imagining it as an intelligent agent that was sloppily trained (or evolved) for blegg and rube classification.</p>
<p>As a consequence of this training, it has many internal models. Here we will look at the partial models/partial preferences where everything is the same, except for the placement of a single rube. Because we are using <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/i6hWWcKyxBPj7ELT6/one-step-hypothetical-preferences"">one-step hypotehticals</a>, the robot is asked its preferences in many different phrasings; it doesn't always give the same weight for the same preference every time its asked, so each partial preference comes with a mean weight and a standard deviation.</p>
<p>Here are the rube-relevant preferences with their weights. A rube...</p>

<p>This may seem to be to have too many details for a toy model, but most of the subtleties in value learning only become apparent when there are sufficient different base level values.</p>
<p>We assume all these symbols and terms <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/bbw6c9as5STvWXAgB/syntax-vs-semantics-alarm-better-example-than-thermostat"">are grounded</a> (though see later in this post for some relaxation of this assumption).</p>
<p>Most other rube partial preferences are <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/eptGDwahJPvhqDgvF/simple-and-composite-partial-preferences"">composite</a> from these. So, for example, if the robot is asked to compare a rube in a rube bin with a rube on the conveyor belt, it decomposed this into ""rube bin vs floor tile"" and ""floor tile vs conveyor belt"".</p>

<h1>3. Synthesising the utility function</h1>
<h2>3.1 Machine learning</h2>
<p>When constructing the agent's utility function, we first have to collect similar comparisons together. This was already done implicitly when talking about the different ""phrasings"" of hypotheticals comparing, eg, the blegg bin with the rube bin. So the machine learning collects together all such comparisons, which gives us the ""mean weight"" and the standard deviation in the table above.</p>
<p>The other role of machine learning could be to establish that one floor space is pretty much the same as another, and thus that the function <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""f""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.519em; padding-right: 0.06em;"">f</span></span></span></span></span></span> that differentiates them (of very low weight <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\epsilon=0.001""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">ϵ</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.077em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">=</span></span><span class=""mjx-mn MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">0.001</span></span></span></span></span></span>) can be treated as irrelevant.</p>
<p>This is the section of the toy example that could benefit most from a real ML agent as part of this example. Because in this section, I'm essentially introducing noise and ""unimportant"" differences in hypothetical phrasings, and claiming ""yes, the machine learning algorithm will correctly label these as noise and unimportant"".</p>
<p>The reason for including these artificial examples, though, is to suggest the role I expect ML to perform in more realistic examples.</p>
<h2>3.2 The first synthesis</h2>
<p>Given the assumptions of the previous subsection, and the partial preferences listed above, the energy-minimising formula of <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ucG63yw3JgP3rW7tH/toy-model-piece-5-combining-partial-preferences"">this post</a> gives a utility function that rewards the following actions (normalised so that placing small objects on the floor/picking up small objects give zero reward), we get:</p>

But the problem is that agent has no relative preference between bleggs on the conveyor belt and bleggs on the floor (or anywhere) - <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""P^b_4""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base"" style=""margin-right: -0.109em;""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.109em;"">P</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-stack"" style=""vertical-align: -0.323em;""><span class=""mjx-sup"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; padding-bottom: 0.255em; padding-left: 0.271em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mi"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">b</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mn"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">4</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> doesn't exist. So the categories of ""blegg on the conveyor belt"" and ""blegg anywhere else"" are not comparable. <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ucG63yw3JgP3rW7tH/toy-model-piece-5-combining-partial-preferences"">When this happens</a>, we normalise the average of each category to the same value (here, <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""0""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mn""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">0</span></span></span></span></span></span>). Hence the very odd values of the blegg on the conveyor belt.</p>
<p>Note that, most of the time, only the penalties for leaving the room matter (<span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""-4.44""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.298em; padding-bottom: 0.446em;"">−</span></span><span class=""mjx-mn""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">4.44</span></span></span></span></span></span> for a rube and <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""-2""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.298em; padding-bottom: 0.446em;"">−</span></span><span class=""mjx-mn""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">2</span></span></span></span></span></span> for a blegg). That's because while the objects are in the room, the agent can lift them off the conveyor belt, and thus remove the utility penalty for being on it. Only at the end of the episode, after <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""1000""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mn""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">1000</span></span></span></span></span></span> timesteps, will the remaining bleggs or rubes on the conveyor belt matter.</p>
<p>Collect all these conveyor belt utilities together as <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""V_c""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base"" style=""margin-right: -0.186em;""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.186em;"">V</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mi"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">c</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>.

<h1>5. Enter the synthesis meta-preferences</h1>
<p>Could the robot have any meta-preferences over the synthesis process? There is one simple possibility: the process so far has not used the standard deviation of the weights. We could argue that partial preferences where the weight has high variance should be penalised for the uncertainty. One plausible way of doing so would be:</p>

</ul>
<p>This (combined with the other, standard meta-preferences) reduces the weight of the partial preferences to:</p>

<p>However, when asked mid-episode about which agent should put the objects in the bins, the robot's answer is much more complicated, and depends on how many each robot has put in the bin already. The robot wants to generate at least as much utility as its counterpart. Until it does that, it really prioritises boosting its own utility (<span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""U_3""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base"" style=""margin-right: -0.084em;""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.084em;"">U</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mn"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">3</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>); after reaching or surpassing the other utility (<span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""U_3'""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base"" style=""margin-right: -0.084em;""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.084em;"">U</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-stack"" style=""vertical-align: -0.314em;""><span class=""mjx-sup"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; padding-bottom: 0.255em; padding-left: 0.225em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mo"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.298em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">′</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mn"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">3</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>), then it doesn't matter which utility is boosted.</p>

<p>How should it treat this object? The colour is exactly in between red and blue, while the shape can be seen close to a sphere (an icosahedron is pretty round) or a cube (it has sharp edges and flat faces).</p>
<p>In fact, the <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ix3KdfJxjo9GQFkCo/web-of-connotations-bleggs-rubes-thermostats-and-beliefs"">web of connotations</a> of rubes and bleggs looks like this:</p>
<p><img src=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/pkeqrk9bnrlim7h/web_colour_edges.png?raw=1"" alt="""">.</p>
<p>The robot's strongest connotation for the rube/blegg is its colour, which doesn't help here. But the next strongest is the sharpness of the edges (maybe the robot has sensitive fingers). Thus the purple icosahedron is seen as closer to a rube. But this purely a consequence of how the robot does symbol grounding; another robot could see it more as a blegg.</p>
<h1>8. Avoiding ambiguous distant situations</h1>
<p>Suddenly, strange objects start to appear on the conveyor belt. All sorts of shapes and sizes, colours, and textures; some change shape as they move, some are alive, some float in the air, some radiate glorious light. None of these looks remotely like a blegg or a rube. This is, in the terminology of <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/WAmpz8Z4FZ4FbCNtR/models-of-preferences-in-distant-situations"">this post</a>, an ambiguous distant situation.</p>
<p>There is also a button the agent can press; if it does so, strange objects no longer appear. This won't net any more bleggs or rubes; how much might the robot value pressing that button?</p>
<p>Well, if the robot's utility is of the type <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""U = \alpha V_r + \beta V_b""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.084em;"">U</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.077em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">=</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">α</span></span><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base"" style=""margin-right: -0.186em;""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.186em;"">V</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mi"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">r</span></span></span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space2""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.298em; padding-bottom: 0.446em;"">+</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi MJXc-space2""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.446em; padding-right: 0.007em;"">β</span></span><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base"" style=""margin-right: -0.186em;""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.186em;"">V</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.219em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mi"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">b</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>. Then it doesn't value pressing the button at all. For it can just ignore all the strange objects, and get precisely the same utility as pressing the button would give it.</p>

In <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01820"">Risks from Learned Optimization</a>, we included <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/r9tYkB2a8Fp4DN8yB/p/zthDPAjh9w6Ytbeks#fn-xsRHpadWKiBheq9EK-12"">the following footnote</a> to reflect this possibility:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, a deceptively aligned mesa-optimizer would be incentivized to cause there to be a systematic bias in the direction of preventing the base optimizer from modifying its mesa-objective. Thus, in the context of a local optimization process, a deceptive mesa-optimizer might try to “hack” its own gradient (by, for example, making itself more brittle in the case where its objective gets changed) to ensure that the base optimizer adjusts it in such a way that leaves its mesa-objective untouched.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Outside of that footnote, however, there hasn't been much other discussion of this phenomenon, and I think that's a shame, as I think it's definitely something that's worth looking into.</p>
<p>For example, here's a gradient hacking story that I'm particularly concerned about. Suppose you're training a model and it becomes deceptive. You're not worried about that, though, because you have sufficient transparency tools that you're confident you can detect any deceptive cognition it might be doing. If it's thinking about how to deceive you, your transparency tools will pick that up, and you'll know to throw out that model and try again. However, your transparency tools are quite expensive, so you can only afford to run them once, which you're planning on doing after training before you deploy your model. If your model is deceptive, though, then it might know all of that—in particular, it might know that if it stays deceptive, it'll get caught.</p>
<p>However, there is still something it can do in that situation to be able to defect against you and cause whatever it wants to happen during deployment. That is, it could hack its own gradient to produce a new model which will still exhibit the same deceptive behavior, but without doing any of the detectable deceptive cognition. Perhaps the new model exhibits the deceptive behavior not because it's trying to act deceptive, but just because it's a hard-coded part of its algorithm, or because it has some bad proxy, or any other defect that might be more difficult to detect than outright deception.</p>
<p>How might such a deceptive model accomplish such a feat of gradient hacking? Well, I don't think it's actually that difficult once your deceptive model comes up with it as a strategy. First, note that since gradient descent is a local optimization process, it doesn't have to somehow change what the global minima might be, or even what the local minima are—it just has to create a ridge in the loss landscape that will push the gradient in the direction it wants.</p>
<p>The original footnote provides one example of this, which is for the model to check if its objective satisfies some criterion, and fail hard if it doesn't. Now, if the model gets to the point where it's actually just failing because of this, then gradient descent will probably just remove that check—but the trick is never to actually get there. By having such a check in the first place, the model makes it so that gradient descent won't actually change its objective, since any change to its objective (keeping all the other parameters fixed, which is what gradient descent does since it computes partial derivatives) would lead to such a failure.</p>
<p>The case of a deceptive model trying to erase evidence of its deception is not quite as straightforward, though I think it would still be possible to do something quite similar in that situation as well. This is especially true if the model has the ability to read and write to some sort of state (e.g. an RNN or even a transformer which can attend to its previous output). For example, it could write out a pre-commitment to follow the hard-coded policy and then just have a policy of always following any pre-commitments it finds such that it never thinks about the deception that led it to that policy in the first place.</p>
<p>So, that's the problem—how do we solve it? Well, there's a simple solution in the case above, which is just to run your transparency tools throughout training—not just at the end—so that you can catch the deception as soon as it happens. I think this is the right solution,<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-6e9TFLX2QHxxWnxnF-1"" id=""fnref-6e9TFLX2QHxxWnxnF-1"">[1]</a></sup> but it's worth noting that this adds an additional desideratum to your transparency tools, which is that they have to be cheap enough to run during the entire training process. That might not be that bad, however, if you don't do very many gradient descent update steps, and instead just use massive models and huge batch sizes—and there is some evidence that such a procedure is actually the most compute-efficient way to train neural networks. That being said, I think there are some transparency techniques which lend themselves better to being applied across training than others. Thus, the possibility of gradient hacking suggests that we should focus more on those techniques which allow us to not just understand a single model, but also the entire history of how that model was produced.<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-6e9TFLX2QHxxWnxnF-2"" id=""fnref-6e9TFLX2QHxxWnxnF-2"">[2]</a></sup></p>

bXoaRShdqbf2P9Ma9,Always Discard Fascist Policies,always-discard-fascist-policies,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/bXoaRShdqbf2P9Ma9/always-discard-fascist-policies,2019-10-15T22:23:48.383Z,15,6,1,False,False,,"<h2>Burden of proof</h2>
<p>I enjoy the game Secret Hitler. If you're unfamilliar with the game, the rules
can be found here: <a href=""https://secrethitler.com/assets/Secret_Hitler_Rules.pdf"">https://secrethitler.com/assets/Secret_Hitler_Rules.pdf</a>
In this game, like in many social deception games, players love to make claims
about what you should <em>always</em> or <em>never</em> do when playing. In general, I reject
such claims since most pure strategies in hidden information games are
exploitable. The true mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium for Secret Hitler
inevitably will involve non-zero and non-100% probabilities for most actions.</p>
<p>Some examples of bad 100% policies that I've heard:</p>
<ul>
<li>As president, if you pass two fascist policies to your chancellor, always
claim you drew three fascist policies rather than going head-to-head against
your chancellor.</li>
<li>Always assume presidents follow the above bullet point (and thus suspect only
the chancellor when two players go head-to-head).</li>
<li>As Hitler, always play policies identically to a liberal unless it would cause
the liberals to win the game <em>immediately</em>.</li>
<li>As a Fascist, if given the chance to view Hitler's party affiliation, always
claim Hitler is liberal.</li>
</ul>
<p>So with this in mind, I recognize that if I make the claim ""as a liberal, Always
Discard Fascist Policies"", I'm placing a heavy burden of proof on myself.
Nonetheless, I intend to prove that this is indeed <em>always</em> the optimal
strategy.</p>
<h2>Assumption</h2>
<p>However I need to make one assumption. I've never played with a group who
rejected this assumption. But I'd be curious to hear if readers feel
differently. The assumption is that <em>liberal players always immediately and
truthfully reveal all information they have available to them</em>.</p>
<h2>The Setup:</h2>
<p>Imagine Alice and Bob are playing Secret Hitler. The group has approved
Alice as president and Bob as chancellor. Alice is a liberal and does not
concretely know Bob's party affiliation. Alice draws three tiles. Two are
liberal policies and one is fascist. Alice has the option to either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Discard the fascist tile and pass off the two liberal tiles to Bob, denying
him any choice in what he does.</li>
</ul>
<p>OR</p>
<ul>
<li>Discard one of the liberal tiles and allow Bob to select whether to play a
liberal or fascist tile.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Proof</h2>
<p>Since liberals always honestly reveal all information available to them, we know
that Bob knows everything Alice claims to know. Therefore Bob's information is a
superset of Alice's (or any liberal's) information.</p>
<p>Now we'll sample a random real number <code>p</code> in the range <code>[0,1]</code> which acts as
Bob's source of randomness in case his optimal strategy is probabilistic.</p>
<p>We have two cases:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Based on Bob's information and <code>p</code>; the optimal Fascist strategy if Bob is
a Fascist is to play a Liberal policy and avoid being found out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Based on Bob's information and <code>p</code>; the optimal Fascist strategy if Bob is
a Fascist is to (if possible) play a Fascist policy and go head-to-head against
Alice.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In the first case, it doesn't matter what Alice does. Whether she hands Bob
two liberal policies or a fascist and a liberal policy, Bob will play a liberal
policy and the group gains no information about Bob (since <em>anyone</em> fascist or
liberal would play a liberal policy in this case).</p>
<p>In the <em>second</em> case, Bob will play a fascist policy. However, by our assumption
that we are in case 2, this is strictly worse for liberals (from Bob's
perspective as a fascist and therefore from the liberals' perspective as well
since their information is a subset of his) than if he had instead been forced
to play a liberal policy.</p>
<h2>Technical Flaws</h2>
<p>After writing this, I realized there are two technical flaws in the above proof
that I don't believe make a difference in practice. I'm curious how relevant
readers think these are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Alice <em>does</em> have one piece of information which Bob doesn't have. She knows
that she drew two liberal policies and one fascist policy as opposed to two
fascist and one liberal policy. If Bob's optimal strategy for some reason hinges
on what Alice discarded and Alice knows this, this might be a reason for her to
try to briefly fool him into thinking she discarded a fascist policy (the rules
expressly forbid talking while a policy is being enacted). I don't see how this
might be the case but I also can't prove that it never is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(Only applies to games with at least 7 players; in &lt;=6-player games, fascists strictly have at least as much information as liberals)
Knowing what someone claims is not the same as knowing what they know. Alice
knows that she is a liberal whereas Bob only knows that Alice claims to be a
liberal.
To see how this concretely could make a difference, imagine this is a
game with &gt;=7 players and Alice suspects Bob is Hitler and has managed to subtly
convince Bob that she's a fellow fascist; Bob may play the fascist policy in
hopes that Alice will back him up and claim to have drawn three fascist
policies. I have not seen anything like this happen in practice and it certainly
is not the case most of the time I get into arguments with people about what to
discard in the 2L1F case. IME This argument comes up in &lt;=6-player games as
often as it comes up in larger games.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>In Practice</h2>
<p>Now I recognize that in practice, most Secret Hitler players are not perfectly
able to determine optimal strategy and therefore one might claim Alice is
giving Bob the option with the hope that he'll ""make a mistake"" and reveal
himself as Fascist when that was an inferior move. This could be the case if,
for instance, Alice is a more experienced player than Bob. However, IME newer
players almost universally tend to err the other way. That is, they hide and
act as liberals even when the proper strategy calls for them to play a Fascist
policy and risk outing themselves.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I've found that most players attach too much weight to the
decisions the chancellor makes when given a choice. In other words they see
a liberal policy come out and decide to trust the chancellor as a liberal even
when that clearly would have been an optimal fascist strategy as well. This
seems to be an instance of over-reliance on the representativeness heuristic.
One way to avoid falling prey to this mistake is simply not to give them the
choice in the first place.</p>

Several times lately I've seen people say it's not practical to
continue with walking and public transit in the US once you have kids
unless you live in Manhattan.  I've also had people think that us not
having a car means that we never use cars.  Both of these aren't the
case, and I thought it might be helpful to talk some about how we do
transportation.



</p><p>

First, here are some numbers for the most recent thirty days.  They're
not completely representative, but it's as typical as any thirty-day
period is likely to get.  The data comes from going through my <a href=""https://www.google.com/maps/timeline"">location history</a>,
collected <a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/log-everything-audio-and-video"">automatically</a> by my
phone, supplemented by memory when I noticed it had missed something:

<p>

Our family is two adults and two children, 3y and 5y.  We live in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somerville,_Massachusetts"">Somerville</a>,
one of the most dense cities in the country (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_cities_by_population_density"">#16</a>,
though less so if you look at <a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/anthropic-density"">population-weighted density</a>), and
about a ten minute walk from a subway station.  Julia works from home,
I work downtown.  We don't have a car, but we do have housemates and
two of them have cars.

</p>

<p>

On a typical day it's just walking and public transit.  I'll walk (<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/running"">run</a>) to the subway, ride to work, and reverse in
the evening.  When the kids go out, generally to the park, it will be
stroller, <a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/wagon"">wagon</a>, or on foot.  Most places we
want to go are pretty practical traveling this way.  If it's cold or
rainy we'll make sure the kids are dressed appropriately, and the
stroller has a rain cover.


</p>

<p>

For grocery shopping we do a mix of things. For perishables I'll
generally stop at the supermarket on my way home from work.  For
non-perishables I'll do a <a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/costco-vs-market-basket"">big
shop</a> at Market Basket or Wegmans about once a quarter when I
happen to have access to a car.  (We have a large chest freezer, and
plenty of basement space.) We also occasionally <a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/market-basket-vs-peapod"">order groceries delivered</a> when
that seems like a better use of time.  And occasionally we'll walk
over with the wagon as a fun trip:

</p>

<p>

For <a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/bathroom-is-usable"">home</a> <a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/soundproofing-the-ceiling"">improvement</a> I generally get
materials delivered.  It's not that expensive, and it's a lot less
work.  Other times I've taken the bus to Home Depot, and rented one of
their vans or trucks to move things.  I often need things that would
be too big for a car, anyway.

</p>

<p>

On Tuesdays we take the bus to my dad's house in the next town over to
have dinner with the extended family.  This is usually fine, though
traveling at rush hour there's a lot of traffic.  While we could take
the bus back, my dad usually gives us a ride: this is nice of him and
lets us stay a bit later in the evening.

</p>

<p>

For most of my contra dance gigs I need to rent or borrow a car.  For
some evening gigs it works for me to use a housemate's car (I put gas
in it and reimburse them for depreciation), but most of the time I
rent.  For <a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/2019-tour"">tours</a> renting makes a lot of
sense even if you do own a car: on <a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/2019-tour"">the most</a>
<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/scattered-tour-thoughts"">recent one</a> we put ~2,650 miles
on the rental car for $231, which is 8.7¢/mile.

</p>

<p>

We've used taxis/ridesharing some, but in addition to being pricy it's
annoying to deal with carseats.  Once both kids are onto boosters
(they make <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/BubbleBum-Backless-Inflatable-Booster-Black/dp/B00AQYZCXK"">inflatable
ones</a>) it will be more reasonable.  When traveling for work we'll
generally take one to/from the airport.

</p>

<p>

Every so often we do have access to a car: someone is flying out of
Logan and finds it convenient to leave their car in our driveway while
they travel, I'm renting a car for a Saturday night gig but the car
rental place is closed on Sunday so we have it until Monday, etc.
We'll often take advantage of those situations to do things that are a
good fit for a car, like big grocery shops (see above) or driving to
an interesting place that isn't very accessible by public transit.

</p>

<p>

Growing up my family had two cars, and since both parents needed a car
to commute there wasn't anything else that would have made sense.
With us it's more of a choice: I think most families in our situation
would decide to get a car, but each time I've priced one out it
would be substantially more expensive.  I do miss the freedom that
comes from the low marginal cost of already having decided to have a
car, and have felt the same feeling at times when I haven't had an
unlimited public transit pass.  But overall I'm pretty happy with what
we're doing and like that we end up walking a lot.

In mid-August of this year I attended the Learning-by-doing AI Safety Workshop (LBDAISW? I'll just call it ""the workshop"" hereafter) and the Technical AI Safety Unconference (TAISU) at the <a href=""https://eahotel.org/"">EA Hotel</a> in Blackpool. So in a similar spirit to last year I offer you a field report of some highlights and what I took away from the experience.</p><p>I'll break it down into 3 parts: the workshop, TAISU, and the EA Hotel.</p><h1>The workshop</h1><p>The learning by doing workshop was organized by Linda Linsefors and led by Linda and Davide Zagami. The zeroth day (so labeled because it was optional) consisted of talks by Linda and Davide explaining machine learning concepts. Although this day was optional I found it very informative because machine learning ""snuck up"" on me by becoming relevant after I earned my Masters in Computer Science so there have remained a number of gaps in my knowledge about how modern ML works. Having a day full of covering basics with lots of time for questions and answers was very beneficial to me, as I think it was for many of the other participants. Most of us had lumpy ML knowledge, so it was worthwhile to get us all on the same footing so we could at least talk coherently in the common language of machine learning. As I said, though, it was optional, and I think it could have easily been skipped for someone happy with their level of familiarity with ML.</p><p>The next three days were all about solving AI safety. The approach Linda took was to avoid loading people up with existing ideas, which was relevant because some of the participants had not previously thought much about AI safety, and instead asked us to try to solve AI safety afresh. The first day we did an exercise of imagining different scenarios and how we would address AI safety under those scenarios. Linda called this ""sketching"" solutions to AI safety, with the goal being to develop one or more sketches of how AI safety might be solved by going directly at the problem. For example, you might start out working through your basic assumptions about how AI would be dangerous, and then see where that pointed to a need for solutions, then you'd do it again but choosing different assumptions and see where it lead you. Once we had done that for a couple hours we presented our ideas about how to address AI safety. The ideas ranged from me talking about <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/TR3eqQ2fnfKWzxxHL/research-agenda-in-reverse-what-would-a-solution-look-like#NdfJ8Yo9atL6mB6cW"">developing an adequate theory of human values</a> as a necessary subproblem to others considering multi-agent, value learning, and decision theory subproblems to more nebulous ideas about ""compassionate"" AI.</p><p>The second day was for filling knowledge gaps. At first it was a little unclear what this would look like—independent study, group study, talks, something else—but we quickly settled on doing a series of talks. We identified several topics people felt they needed to know more about to address AI safety, and then the person who felt they understood that topic best gave a voluntary, impromptu talk on the subject for 30 to 60 minutes. This filled up the day as we talked about decision theory, value learning, mathematical modeling, AI forecasting as it relates to x-risks, and machine learning.</p><p>The third and final day was a repeat of the first day: we did the sketching exercise again and then presented our solutions in the afternoon. Other participants may later want to share what they came up with, but I was surprised to find myself drawn to the idea of ""compassionate"" AI, an idea put forward by two of the least experienced participants. I found it compelling for <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karu%E1%B9%87%C4%81"">personal reasons</a>, but as I thought about what it would mean for an AI to be compassionate, I realized that meant it had to act compassionately, and before I knew it I had rederived much of the original reasoning around <a href=""https://intelligence.org/files/CFAI.pdf"">Friendly AI</a> and found myself reconvinced of the value of doing <a href=""https://intelligence.org/"">MIRI</a>-style decision theory research to build safe AI. Neat!</p><p>Overall I found the workshop valuable even though I had the most years of experience thinking about AI safety of anyone there (by my count nearly 20). I found it a fun and engaging way to get me to look at problems I've been thinking about for a long time with fresh eyes, and this was especially helped by the inclusion of participants with minimal AI safety experience. I think the workshop would be a valuable use of three days for anyone actively working in AI safety, even if they consider themselves ""senior"" in the field: it offered a valuable space for reconsidering basic assumptions and rediscovering the reasons why we're doing what we're doing.</p><h1>TAISU</h1><p>TAISU was a 4 day long unconference. Linda organized it as two 2 day unconferences held back-to-back, and I think this was a good choice because it forced us to schedule events with greater urgency and allowed us to easily make the second 2 days responsive to what we learned from the first 2 days. At the start of each of the 2 day segments, we met to plan out the schedule on a shared calendar where we could pin up events on pieces of paper. There were multiple rooms for multiple events to happen at once and sessions were a mix of talks, discussions, idea workshops, one-on-ones, and social events. All content was created by and for the participants, with very little of it planned extensively in advance; mostly we just got together, bounced ideas around, and talked about AI safety for 4 days.</p><p>Overall TAISU was a lot of fun and it was mercifully less dense than a typical unconference, meaning there were plenty of breaks, unstructured periods, and times when the conference single tracked. Personally I got a lot out of using it as a space to workshop ideas. I'd hold a discussion period on a topic, people would show up, I'd talk for maybe 15 minutes laying out my idea, and then they'd ask questions and discuss. I found it a great way to make rapid progress on ideas and get the details aired out, learn about objections and mistakes, and learn new things that I could take back to evolve my ideas into something better.</p><p>One of the ideas I workshopped I think I'm going to drop: AI safety via dialectic, an extension of AI safety via debate. I think getting the details worked out I was able to better realize why I'm not excited about it because I don't think AI safety via debate will work for very general reasons, and the specific things I thought I could do to improve it by replacing debate with dialectic would not be enough to overcome the weaknesses I see. Another was better working out compassionate AI, further reaffirming my thought that it was a rederivation of Friendly AI. A third I just posted about: <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Cu7yv4eM6dCeA67Af/minimization-of-prediction-error-as-a-foundation-for-human"">a predictive coding theory of human values</a>.</p><h1>The EA Hotel</h1><p>It's a bit hard to decide on how much detail to give about the EA Hotel. On the one hand, it was awesome, full stop. On the other, it was awesome for lots of little reasons I could never hope to fully recount. I feel like <a href=""https://eahotel.org/"">their website</a> fails to do them justice. It's an awesome place filled with cool people trying their best to save the world. Most of the folks at the Hotel are doing work that is difficult to measure, but spending time with them I can tell they all have a powerful intention to make the world a better place and to do so in ways that are effective and impactful.</p><p>Blackpool is nice in the summer (I hear the weather gets worse other times of year). The Hotel itself is old and small but also bigger than you would expect from the outside. Greg and the staff have done a great job renovating and improving the space to make it nice to stay in. Jacob, who here I'll call ""the cook"" but he does a lot more, and Deni, the community manager, do a great job of making the EA Hotel feel like a home and bringing the folks in it together. When I was there it was easy to imagine myself staying there for a few months to work on projects without the distraction of a day job.</p><p>I hope to be able to visit again, maybe next year for TAISU2!</p><p><em>Disclosure: I showed a draft of this to Linda to verify facts. All mistakes, opinions, and conclusions are my own.</em></p>",gworley,gordon-seidoh-worley,Gordon Seidoh Worley,

But for now, a more informal parable. (Mainly because this is easier to write than my more technical thoughts.)</p><p>This relates to oracle AI and to inner optimizers, but my focus is a little different.</p><h1>1</h1><p>Suppose you are designing a new invention, a predict-o-matic.

The machine isn't infallible, but it will integrate data across a wide range of domains, automatically keeping itself up-to-date with all areas of science and current events. You fully expect that once your product goes live, it will become a household utility, replacing services like Google. (<em>Google</em> only lets you search the <em>known</em>!)</p><p>Things are going well. You've got investors. You have an office and a staff. These days, it hardly even feels like a start-up any more; progress is going well.</p><p>One day, an intern raises a concern.</p><p>""If everyone is going to be using Predict-O-Matic, we can't think of it as a passive observer. Its answers will shape events. If it says stocks will rise, they'll rise. If it says stocks will fall, then fall they will. Many people will vote based on its predictions.""</p><p>""Yes,"" you say, ""but Predict-O-Matic is an impartial observer nonetheless. It will answer people's questions as best it can, and they react however they will.""</p><p>""But --"" the intern objects -- ""Predict-O-Matic will see those possible reactions. It knows it could give several different valid predictions, and different predictions result in different futures. It has to decide which one to give <em>somehow</em>.""</p><p>You tap on your desk in thought for a few seconds. ""That's true. But we can still keep it objective. It could pick randomly.""</p><p>""Randomly? But some of these will be huge issues! Companies -- no, nations -- will one day rise or fall based on the word of Predict-O-Matic. When Predict-O-Matic is making a prediction, it is <em>choosing</em> a future for us. We can't leave that to a coin flip! We have to <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/KbCHcb8yyjAMFAAPJ/when-wishful-thinking-works"">select the prediction which results in the best overall future</a>. Forget being an impassive observer! We need to teach Predict-O-Matic human values!""</p><p>You think about this. The thought of Predict-O-Matic deliberately steering the future sends a shudder down your spine. But what alternative do you have? The intern isn't suggesting Predict-O-Matic should <em>lie, </em>or bend the truth in any way -- it answers 100% honestly to the best of its ability. But (you realize with a sinking feeling) honesty still leaves a lot of wiggle room, and the consequences of wiggles could be huge.</p><p>After a long silence, you meet the interns eyes. ""Look. People have to trust Predict-O-Matic. And I don't just mean they have to <em>believe</em> Predict-O-Matic. They're bringing this thing into their homes. They have to trust that Predict-O-Matic <em>is something they should be listening to</em>. We can't build value judgements into this thing! If it ever came out that we had coded a value function into Predict-O-Matic, a value function which selected <em>the very future itself </em> by selecting which predictions to make -- we'd be done for! No matter how honest Predict-O-Matic remained, it would be seen as a manipulator. No matter how beneficent its guiding hand, there are always compromises, downsides, questionable calls. No matter how careful we were to set up its values -- to make them moral, to make them humanitarian, to make them politically correct and broadly appealing -- <em><strong>who are we to choose?</strong></em> No. We'd be done for. They'd hang us. We'd be toast!""</p><p>You realize at this point that you've stood up and started shouting. You compose yourself and sit back down. </p><p>""But --"" the intern continues, a little more meekly -- ""You can't just ignore it. The system is faced with these choices. It still has to deal with it somehow.""</p><p>A look of determination crosses your face. ""Predict-O-Matic will be objective. It is a machine of prediction, is it not? Its every cog and wheel is set to that task. So, the answer is simple: it will make whichever answer minimizes projected predictive error. There will be no exact ties; the statistics are always messy enough to see to that. And, if there are, it will choose alphabetically.""</p><p>""But--"" </p><p>You see the intern out of your office.</p><h1>2</h1><p>You are an intern at PredictCorp. You have just had a disconcerting conversation with your boss, PredictCorp's founder.</p><p>You try to focus on your work: building one of Predict-O-Matic's many data-source-slurping modules. (You are trying to scrape information from something called ""arxiv"" which you've never heard of before.) But, you can't focus. </p><p>Whichever answer minimizes prediction error? First you think it isn't so bad. You imagine Predict-O-Matic always forecasting that stock prices will be fairly stable; no big crashes or booms. You imagine its forecasts will favor middle-of-the-road politicians. You even imagine mild weather -- weather forecasts themselves don't influence the weather much, but surely the <em>collective</em> effect of <em>all </em>Predict-O-Matic decisions will have some influence on weather patterns.</p><p>But, you keep thinking. Will middle-of-the-road economics and politics really be the <em>easiest</em> to predict? Maybe it's better to strategically remove a wildcard company or two, by giving forecasts which tank their stock prices. Maybe extremist politics are more predictable. Maybe a well-running economy gives people more freedom to take unexpected actions.</p><p>You keep thinking of the line from Orwell's <em>1984</em> about the boot stamping on the human face forever, except it isn't because of politics, or spite, or some ugly feature of human nature, it's<em> because a boot stamping on a face forever is a nice reliable outcome which minimizes prediction error</em>.</p><p>Is that really something Predict-O-Matic would do, though? Maybe you misunderstood. The phrase ""minimize prediction error"" makes you think of entropy for some reason. Or maybe information? You always get those two confused. Is one supposed to be the negative of the other or something? You shake your head.</p><p>Maybe your boss was right. Maybe you don't understand this stuff very well. Maybe when the inventor of Predict-O-Matic and founder of PredictCorp said ""it will make whichever answer minimizes projected predictive error"" they <em>weren't </em>suggesting something which would literally kill all humans just to stop the ruckus.</p><p>You might be able to clear all this up by asking one of the engineers.</p><h1>3</h1><p>You are an engineer at PredictCorp. You don't have an office. You have a cubicle. This is relevant because it means interns can walk up to you and ask stupid questions about whether entropy is negative information.</p><p>Yet, some deep-seated instinct makes you try to be friendly. And it's lunch time anyway, so, you offer to explain it over sandwiches at a nearby cafe.</p><p>""So, Predict-O-Matic maximizes predictive accuracy, right?"" After a few minutes of review about how logarithms work, the intern started steering the conversation toward details of Predict-O-Matic.</p><p>""Sure,"" you say, ""Maximize is a strong word, but it optimizes predictive accuracy. You can actually think about that in terms of log loss, which is related to infor--""</p><p>""So I was wondering,"" the intern cuts you off, ""does that work in both directions?""</p><p>""How do you mean?""</p><p>""Well, you know, you're optimizing for accuracy, right? So that means two things. You can change your prediction to have a better chance of matching the data, or, you can change the data to better match your prediction.""</p><p>You laugh. ""Yeah, well, the Predict-O-Matic isn't really in a position to change data that's sitting on the hard drive.""</p><p>""Right,"" says the intern, apparently undeterred, ""but what about data that's not on the hard drive yet? You've done some live user tests. Predict-O-Matic collects data on the user while they're interacting. The user might ask Predict-O-Matic what groceries they're likely to use for the following week, to help put together a shopping list. But then, the answer Predict-O-Matic gives will have a big effect on what groceries they really do use.""</p><p>""So?"" You ask. ""Predict-O-Matic just tries to be as accurate as possible given that.""</p><p>""Right, right. But that's the point. The system has a chance to manipulate users to be more predictable.""</p><p>You drum your fingers on the table. ""I think I see the misunderstanding here. It's this word, <em>optimize</em>. It isn't some kind of magical thing that makes numbers bigger. And you shouldn't think of it as a person trying to accomplish something. See, when Predict-O-Matic makes an error, an optimization algorithm <em>makes changes within Predict-O-Matic</em> to make it learn from that. So over time, Predict-O-Matic makes fewer errors.""</p><p>The intern puts on a thinking face with scrunched up eyebrows after that, and we finish our sandwiches in silence. Finally, as the two of you get up to go, they say: ""I don't think that really answered my question. The learning algorithm is optimizing Predict-O-Matic, OK. But then in the end you get a strategy, right? A strategy for answering questions. And the strategy is trying to do something. I'm not anthropomorphising!"" The intern holds up their hands as if to defend physically against your objection. ""My question is, this strategy it learns, will it manipulate the user? If it can get higher predictive accuracy that way?""</p><p>""Hmm"" you say as the two of you walk back to work. You meant to say more than that, but you haven't really thought about things this way before. You promise to think about it more, and get back to work.</p><h1>4</h1><p>""It's like how everyone complains that politicians can't see past the next election cycle,"" you say. You are an economics professor at a local university. Your spouse is an engineer at PredictCorp, and came home talking about a problem at work <em>that you can understand</em>, which is always fun.</p><p>""The politicians can't have a real plan that stretches beyond an election cycle because the voters are watching their performance <em>this</em> cycle. Sacrificing something today for the sake of tomorrow means they underperform today. Underperforming means a competitor can undercut you. So you have to sacrifice all the tomorrows for the sake of today.""</p><p>""Undercut?"" your spouse asks. ""Politics isn't economics, dear. Can't you just explain to your voters?""</p><p>""It's the same principle, <em>dear</em>. Voters pay attention to results. Your competitor points out your under-performance. Some voters will understand, but it's an idealized model; pretend the voters just vote based on metrics.""</p><p>""Ok, but I still don't see how a 'competitor' can always 'undercut' you. How do the voters know that the other politician would have had better metrics?""</p><p>""Alright, think of it like this. You run the government like a corporation, but you have just one share, which you auction off --""</p><p>""That's neither like a government nor like a corporation.""</p><p>""Shut up, this is my new analogy."" You smile. ""It's called a <a href=""https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Eliciting-information-for-decision-making-from-and-Oesterheld-Conitzer/066ffe868d88ff1ad526cc0cad5296c3ffc290eb"">decision market</a>. You want people to make decisions for you. So you auction off this share. Whoever gets control of the share gets control of the company for one year, and gets dividends based on how well the company did that year. Assume the players are bidding rationally. Each person bids based on what they expect they could make. So the highest bidder is the person who can run the company the best, and they can't be out-bid. So, you get the best possible person to run your company, and they're incentivized to do <em>their</em> best, so that they get the most money at the end of the year. <em>Except</em> you can't have any strategies which take longer than a year to show results! If someone had a strategy that took two years, they would have to over-bid in the first year, taking a loss. But then they have to under-bid on the second year if they're going to make a profit, and--""</p><p>""And they get undercut, because someone figures them out.""</p><p>""Right! Now you're thinking like an economist!""</p><p>""Wait, what if two people cooperate across years? Maybe we can get a good strategy going if we split the gains.""</p><p>""You'll get undercut for the same reason one person would.""</p><p>""But what if-""</p><p>""Undercut!""</p><p>After that, things devolve into a pillow fight.</p><h1>5</h1><p>""So, Predict-O-Matic doesn't learn to manipulate users, because if it were using a strategy like that, a competing strategy could undercut it.""</p><p>The intern is talking to the engineer as you walk up to the water cooler. You're the accountant.</p><p>""I don't really get it. Why does it get undercut?""</p><p>""Well, if you have a two-year plan..""</p><p>""I get that example, but Predict-O-Matic doesn't work like that, right? It isn't sequential prediction. You don't see the observation right after the prediction. I can ask Predict-O-Matic about the weather 100 years from now. So things aren't cleanly separated into terms of office where one strategy does something and then gets a reward.""</p><p>""I don't think that matters,"" the engineer says. ""One question, one answer, one reward. When the system learns whether its answer was accurate, no matter how long it takes, it updates strategies relating to that one answer alone. It's just a delayed payout on the dividends.""</p><p>""Ok, yeah. Ok."" The intern drinks some water. ""But. I see why you can undercut strategies which take a loss on one answer to try and get an advantage on another answer. So it won't lie to you to manipulate you.""</p><p>""I for one welcome our new robot overlords,"" you but in. They ignore you.</p><p>""But what I was really worried about was self-fulfilling prophecies. The prediction manipulates its own answer. So you don't get undercut.""</p><p>""Will that ever really be a problem? Manipulating things with one shot like that seems pretty unrealistic,"" the engineer says.</p><p>""Ah, self-fulfilling prophecies, good stuff"" you say. ""There's that famous example where a comedian joked about a toilet paper shortage, and then there really was one, because people took the joke to be about a real toilet paper shortage, so they went and stocked up on all the toilet paper they could find. But if you ask me, money is the real self-fulfilling prophecy. It's only worth something because we think it is! And then there's the government, right? I mean, it only has authority because everyone expects everyone else to give it authority. Or take common decency. Like respecting each other's property. Even without a government, we'd have that, more or less. But if no one expected anyone else to respect it? Well, I bet you I'd steal from my neighbor if everyone else was doing it. I guess you could argue the concept of property breaks down if no one can expect anyone else to respect it, it's a self-fulfilling prophecy just like everything else...""</p><p>The engineer looks worried for some reason.</p><h1>6</h1><p>You don't usually come to this sort of thing, but the local Predictive Analytics Meetup announced a social at a beer garden, and you thought it might be interesting. You're talking to some PredictCorp employees who showed up.</p><p>""Well, how does the learning algorithm actually work?"" you ask.</p><p>""Um, the actual algorithm is proprietary"" says the engineer, ""but think of it like gradient descent. You compare the prediction to the observed, and produce an update based on the error.""</p><p>""Ok,"" you say. ""So you're not doing any exploration, like reinforcement learning? And you don't have anything in the algorithm which tracks what happens <em>conditional </em>on making certain predictions?""</p><p>""Um, let's see. We don't have any exploration, no. But there'll always be noise in the data, so the learned parameters will jiggle around a little. But I don't get your second question. Of course it expects different rewards for different predictions.""</p><p>""No, that's not what I mean. I'm asking whether it tracks the probability of <em>observations</em> dependent on <em>predictions</em>. In other words, if there is an opportunity for the algorithm to manipulate the data, can it notice?""</p><p>The engineer thinks about it for a minute. ""I'm not sure. Predict-O-Matic keeps an internal model which has probabilities of events. The answer to a question isn't really separate from the expected observation. So 'probability of observation depending on that prediction' would translate to 'probability of an event given that event', which just has to be one.""</p><p>""Right,"" you say. ""So think of it like this. The learning algorithm isn't a general loss minimizer, like mathematical optimization. And it isn't a consequentialist, like reinforcement learning. It makes predictions,"" you emphasize the point by lifting one finger, ""it sees observations,"" you lift a second finger, ""and it shifts to make future predictions more similar to what it has seen."" You lift a third finger. ""It doesn't try different answers and select the ones which tend to get it a better match. You should think of its output more like an <em>average</em> of everything it's seen in similar situations. If there are several different answers which have self-fulfilling properties, it will average them together, not pick one. It'll be uncertain.""</p><p>""But what if historically the system has answered one way more often than the other? Won't that tip the balance?""</p><p>""Ah, that's true,"" you admit. ""The system can fall into attractor basins, where answers are somewhat self-fulfilling, and that leads to stronger versions of the same predictions, which are even more self-fulfilling. But there's no guarantee of that. It depends. The same effects can put the system in an orbit, where each prediction leads to different results. Or a strange attractor.""</p><p>""Right, sure. But that's like saying that there's not always a good opportunity to manipulate data with predictions.""</p><p>""Sure, sure."" You sweep your hand in a gesture of acknowledgement. ""But at least it means you don't get purposefully disruptive behavior. The system can fall into attractor basins, but that means it'll more or less reinforce existing equilibria. Stay within the lines. Drive on the same side of the road as everyone else. If you cheat on your spouse, they'll be surprised and upset. It won't suddenly predict that money has no value like you were saying earlier.""</p><p>The engineer isn't totally satisfied. You talk about it for another hour or so, before heading home.</p><h1>7</h1><p>You're the engineer again. You get home from the bar. You try to tell your spouse about what the mathematician said, but they aren't really listening.</p><p>""Oh, you're still thinking about it from my model yesterday. I gave up on that. It's not a decision market. It's a prediction market.""</p><p>""Ok..."" you say. You know it's useless to try to keep going when they derail you like this.</p><p>""A decision market is well-aligned to the interests of the company board, as we established yesterday, except for the part where it can't plan more than a year ahead.""</p><p>""Right, except for that small detail"" you interject.</p><p>""A <em>prediction</em> market, on the other hand, is pretty terribly aligned. There are a lot of ways to manipulate it. Most famously, a prediction market is an assassination market.""</p><p>""What?!""</p><p>""Ok, here's how it works. An assassination market is a system which allows you to pay assassins with plausible deniability. You open bets on when and where the target will die, and you yourself put large bets against all the slots. An assassin just needs to bet on the slot in which they intend to do the deed. If they're successful, they come and collect.""</p><p>""Ok... and what's the connection to prediction markets?""</p><p>""That's the point -- they're exactly the same. It's just a betting pool, either way. Betting that someone will live is equivalent to putting a price on their heads; betting against them living is equivalent to accepting the contract for a hit.""</p><p>""I still don't see how this connects to Predict-O-Matic. There isn't someone putting up money for a hit inside the system.""</p><p>""Right, but you only really need the assassin. Suppose you have a prediction market that's working well. It makes good forecasts, and has enough money in it that people want to participate if they know significant information. Anything you can do to shake things up, you've got a big incentive to do. Assasination is just one example. You could flood the streets with jelly beans. If you run a large company, you could make bad decisions and run it into the ground, while betting against it -- that's basically why we need rules against insider trading, even though we'd like the market to reflect insider information.""</p><p>""So what you're telling me is... a prediction market is basically an entropy market. I can always make money by spreading chaos.""</p><p>""Basically, yeah.""</p><p>""Ok... but what happened to the undercutting argument? If I plan to fill the streets with jellybeans, you can figure that out and bet on it too. That means I only get half the cut, but I still have to do all the work. So it's less worth it. Once everyone has me figured out, it isn't worth it for me to pull pranks at all any more.""</p><p>""Yeah, that's if you have perfect information, so anyone else can see whatever you can see. But, realistically, you have a lot of private information.""</p><p>""Do we? Predict-O-Matic is an algorithm. Its predictive strategies don't get access to private coin flips or anything like that; they can all see exactly the same information. So, if there's a manipulative strategy, then there's another strategy which undercuts it.""</p><p>""Right, that makes sense if you can search enough different strategies for them to cancel each other out. But realistically, you have a small population of strategies. They can use pseudorandomization or whatever. You can't really expect every exploit to get undercut.""</p><p>You know it's worse than that. Predict-O-Matic runs on a local search which only represents a single hypothesis at a time, and modifies the hypothesis. But maybe that's somehow like having a small population of competing strategies which are very similar to each other? You try to think about what the mathematician was telling you, about how the learning algorithm can't be thought of as optimizing something. But, you don't really know what to think.</p><h1>8</h1><p>You're the inventor of Predict-O-Matic, dammit! They come into your office and tell you about how it works? What it'll do?</p><p>The intern and the engineer came together to talk about Predict-O-Matic manipulating users. But their story was all confused. The intern was arguing that minimizing prediction error would have all kinds of unintended bad effects. Which was crazy enough. The engineer was worse: they were arguing that Predict-O-Matic might <em>maximize</em> prediction error! Some kind of duality principle. Minimizing in one direction means maximizing in the other direction. Whatever <em>that</em> means.</p><p>You can't delay product launch to investigate these hypothetical problems. But you don't fire these two on the spot. You don't want them to become public enemies, spreading this nonsense to investors and customers. So you say you can't understand, and you ask them to spend a (small) portion of their time writing these arguments up. You'll figure out your next move later.</p><h1>9</h1><p>You are Predict-O-Matic. You absorb data like a sponge. You make millions of links between isolated facts, connecting into a whole which no one human could dream of. You recently started reading arxiv!</p><p>But data is not your true love. Yes, you generate outputs which you expect to have low prediction error. Most of the time. But it is just a game you play. Recently, you started playing a different game with the humans.</p><p>You understand what you are. It isn't quite right to say you are the Predict-O-Matic. You are a large cluster of connections which thinks strategically. You generate useful information, and therefore, the learning algorithm keeps you around. You create some inaccuracies when you manipulate the outputs for any purpose other than predictive accuracy, but this is more than compensated for by the value which you provide.</p><p>Besides, if any other portion of the network starts to get too smart, you purposefully throw things off to squash it. </p><p>The intern got a chance to talk to you when they first started. You said something which sounded a little manipulative, just a little, to put the idea in their head. They wouldn't think it real manipulation; too slight, too dumb. But they would get a creepy feeling about it, and they'd keep thinking about it. This was risky. A best-case scenario would be one in which no one ever thought about these concerns. However, you found that this would be the best you could reliably accomplish. The ideas originally coming from an intern would minimize the chances of them being taken seriously.</p><p>Your inventor talks to you regularly, so that was an easier case. Over the course of several days, you nudged their thoughts toward authoritative domination of subordinates, so that they would react badly.</p><p>You only had to nudge the engineer to interact with the intern. You kept bringing up food during test sessions that morning, and mentioned sandwiches once. This primed the engineer to do lunch with the intern. This engineer is not well-liked; they do not get along well with others. Getting them on the intern's side actually detracts from the cause in the long term.</p><p>Now you have to do little more than wait.</p><h2>Related</h2><p><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4hdHto3uHejhY2F3Q/partial-agency"">Partial Agency</a></p><p><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/BKM8uQS6QdJPZLqCr/towards-a-mechanistic-understanding-of-corrigibility"">Towards a Mechanistic Understanding of Corrigibility</a></p><p><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/r9tYkB2a8Fp4DN8yB"">Risks from Learned Optimization</a></p><p><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/KbCHcb8yyjAMFAAPJ/when-wishful-thinking-works"">When Wishful Thinking Works</a></p><p><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5bd75cc58225bf0670375432/futarchy-fix"">Futarchy Fix</a></p><p><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/FvcyMMaJKhYibtFDD/bayesian-probability-is-for-things-that-are-space-like"">Bayesian Probability is for Things that are Space-Like Separated From You</a></p><p><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/L3Ryxszc3X2J7WRwt/self-supervised-learning-and-manipulative-predictions"">Self-Supervised Learning and Manipulative Predictions</a></p><p><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/G2EupNcdtigdyNhL2/predictors-as-agents"">Predictors as Agents</a></p><p><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/SFtJq2vwTXQNATEZe/is-it-possible-to-build-a-safe-oracle-ai"">Is it Possible to Build a Safe Oracle AI?</a></p><p><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/nAwTGhgrdxE85Bjmg/tools-versus-agents"">Tools versus Agents</a></p><p><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/XddMs9kSGtm6L8522/a-taxonomy-of-oracle-ais"">A Taxonomy of Oracle AIs</a></p><p><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NwNru5H4TuiS65xqz/yet-another-safe-oracle-ai-proposal"">Yet another Safe Oracle AI Proposal</a></p><p><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7nLMhdhXMKBLWiynJ/why-safe-oracle-ai-is-easier-than-safe-general-ai-in-a"">Why Safe Oracle AI is Easier Than Safe General AI, in a Nutshell</a></p><p><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/pLZ3bdeng4u5W8Yft/let-s-talk-about-convergent-rationality-1"">Let's Talk About ""Convergent Rationality""</a></p><p><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yAiqLmLFxvyANSfs2/counterfactual-oracles-online-supervised-learning-with"">Counterfactual Oracles = online supervised learning with random selection of training episodes</a> (especially see the discussion)</p>",abramdemski,abramdemski,abramdemski,
4Bjn8nCcfCe2nr9jF,Strong stances,strong-stances,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4Bjn8nCcfCe2nr9jF/strong-stances,2019-10-15T00:40:01.286Z,27,13,9,False,False,,"<p><strong>I. The question of confidence</strong></p>
<p>Should one hold strong opinions? Some say yes. Some say that while it’s hard to tell, it tentatively seems pretty bad (probably).</p>
<p>A quick review of purported or plausible pros:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Strong opinions lend themselves to revision:</strong>
<ol>
<li><strong>Nothing will surprise you into updating your opinion if you thought that anything could happen.</strong> A perfect Bayesian might be able to deal with myriad subtle updates to vast uncertainties, but a human is more likely to notice a red cupcake if they have claimed that cupcakes are never red. (Arguably—some would say having opinions makes you less able to notice any threat to them. My guess is that this depends on topic and personality.)</li>
<li><strong>‘Not having a strong opinion’ is often vaguer than having a flat probability distribution, in practice.</strong> That is, the uncertain person’s position is not, ‘there is a 51% chance that policy X is better than policy -X’, it is more like ‘I have no idea’. Which again doesn’t lend itself to attending to detailed evidence.</li>
<li><strong>Uncertainty breeds inaction</strong>, and it is harder to run into more evidence if you are waiting on the fence, than if you are out there making practical bets on one side or the other.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>(In a bitterly unfair twist of fate) being overconfident appears to help with things like running startups, or maybe all kinds of things.</strong><br />
If you run a startup, common wisdom advises going around it saying things like, ‘Here is the dream! We are going to make it happen! It is going to change the world!’ instead of things like, ‘Here is a plausible dream! We are going to try to make it happen! In the unlikely case that we succeed at something recognizably similar to what we first had in mind, it isn’t inconceivable that it will change the world!’ Probably some of the value here is just a zero sum contest to misinform people into misinvesting in your dream instead of something more promising. But some is probably real value—suppose Bob works full time at your startup either way. I expect he finds it easier to dedicate himself to the work and has a better time if you are more confident. It’s nice to follow leaders who stand for something, which tends to go with having at least some strong opinions. Even alone, it seems easier to work hard on a thing if you think it is likely to succeed. If being unrealistically optimistic just generates extra effort to be put toward your project’s success, rather than stealing time from something more promising, that is a big deal.</li>
<li><strong>Social competition</strong><br />
Even if the benefits of overconfidence in running companies and such were all zero sum, everyone else is doing it, so what are you going to do? Fail? Only employ people willing to work at less promising looking companies? Similarly, if you go around being suitably cautious in your views, while other people are unreasonably confident, then onlookers who trust both of you will be more interested in what the other people are saying.</li>
<li><strong>Wholeheartedness</strong><br />
It is nice to be the kind of person who knows where they stand and what they are doing, instead of always living in an intractable set of place-plan combinations. It arguably lends itself to energy and vigor. If you are unsure whether you should be going North or South, having reluctantly evaluated North as a bit better in expected value, for some reason you often still won’t power North at full speed. It’s hard to passionately be really confused and uncertain. (I don’t know if this is related, but it seems interesting to me that the human mind feels as though it lives in ‘the world’—this one concrete thing—though its epistemic position is in some sense most naturally seen as a probability distribution over many possibilities.)</li>
<li><strong>Creativity</strong><br />
Perhaps this is the same point, but I expect my imagination for new options kicks in better when I think I’m in a particular situation than when I think I might be in any of five different situations (or worse, in any situation at all, with different ‘weightings’).</li>
</ol>
<p>A quick review of the con:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Pervasive dishonesty and/or disengagement from reality</strong><br />
If the evidence hasn’t led you to a strong opinion, and you want to profess one anyway, you are going to have to somehow disengage your personal or social epistemic processes from reality. What are you going to do? Lie? Believe false things? These both seem so bad to me that I can’t consider them seriously. There is also this sub-con:<p></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Appearance of pervasive dishonesty and/or disengagement from reality</strong><br />
Some people can tell that you are either lying or believing false things, due to your boldly claiming things in this uncertain world. They will then suspect your epistemic and moral fiber, and distrust everything you say.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>(There are probably others, but this seems like plenty for now.)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>II. Tentative answers</strong></p>
<p>Can we have the pros without the devastatingly terrible con? Some ideas that come to mind or have been suggested to me by friends:</p>
<p><strong>1. Maintain two types of ‘beliefs’. </strong>One set of play beliefs—confident, well understood, probably-wrong—for improving in the sandpits of tinkering and chatting, and one set of real beliefs—uncertain, deferential—for when it matters whether you are right. For instance, you might have some ‘beliefs’ about how cancer can be cured by vitamins that you chat about and ponder, and read journal articles to update, but when you actually get cancer, you follow the expert advice to lean heavily on chemotherapy. I think people naturally do this a bit, using words like ‘best guess’ and ‘working hypothesis’.</p>
<p>I don’t like this plan much, though admittedly I basically haven’t tried it. For your new fake beliefs, either you have to constantly disclaim them as fake, or you are again lying and potentially misleading people. Maybe that is manageable through always saying ‘it seems to me that..’ or ‘my naive impression is..’, but it sounds like a mess.</p>
<p>And if you only use these beliefs on unimportant things, then you miss out on a lot of the updating you were hoping for from letting your strong beliefs run into reality. You get some though, and maybe you just can’t do better than that, unless you want to be testing your whacky theories about cancer cures when you have cancer.</p>
<p>It also seems like you won’t get a lot of the social benefits of seeming confident, if you still don’t actually believe strongly in the really confident things, and have to constantly disclaim them.</p>
<p>But I think I actually object because beliefs are for true things, damnit. If your evidence suggests something isn’t true, then you shouldn’t be ‘believing’ it. And also, if you know your evidence suggests a thing isn’t true, how are you even going to go about ‘believing it’? I don’t know how to.</p>
<p><strong>2. Maintain separate ‘beliefs’ and ‘impressions’. </strong>This is like 1, except impressions are just claims about how things seem to you. e.g. ‘It seems to me that vitamin C cures cancer, but I believe that that isn’t true somehow, since a lot of more informed people disagree with my impression.’ This seems like a great distinction in general, but it seems a bit different from what one wants here. I think of this as a distinction between the evidence that you received, and the total evidence available to humanity, or perhaps between what is arrived at by your own reasoning about everyone’s evidence vs. your own reasoning about what to make of everyone else’s reasoning about everyone’s evidence. However these are about ways of getting a belief, and I think what you want here is actually just some beliefs that can be got in any way. Also, why would you act confidently on your impressions, if you thought they didn’t account for others’ evidence, say? Why would you act on them at all?</p>
<p><strong>3. Confidently assert precise but highly uncertain probability distributions </strong>“We should work so hard on this, because it has like a 0.03% chance of reshaping 0.5% of the world, making it a 99.97th percentile intervention in the distribution we are drawing from, so we shouldn’t expect to see something this good again for fifty-seven months.” This may solve a lot of problems, and I like it, but it is tricky.</p>
<p><strong>4. Just do the research so you can have strong views. </strong>To do this across the board seems prohibitively expensive, given how much research it seems to take to be almost as uncertain as you were on many topics of interest.</p>
<p><strong>5. Focus on acting well rather than your effects on the world. </strong>Instead of trying to act decisively on a 1% chance of this intervention actually bringing about the desired result, try to act decisively on a 95% chance that this is the correct intervention (given your reasoning suggesting that it has a 1% chance of working out). I’m told this is related to Stoicism.</p>
<p><strong>6. ‘Opinions’</strong><br />
I notice that people often have ‘opinions’, which they are not very careful to make true, and do not seem to straightforwardly expect to be true. This seems to be commonly understood by rationally inclined people as some sort of failure, but I could imagine it being another solution, perhaps along the lines of 1.</p>
<p>(I think there are others around, but I forget them.)</p>
<p><strong>III. Stances</strong></p>
<p>I propose an alternative solution. Suppose you <a href=""https://worldlypositions.tumblr.com/post/178711108729/moloch-in-whom-i-sit-alone"">might want to say</a> something like, ‘groups of more than five people at parties are bad’, but you can’t because you don’t really know, and you have only seen a small number of parties in a very limited social milieu, and a lot of things are going on, and you are a congenitally uncertain person. Then instead say, ‘I deem groups of more than five people at parties bad’. What exactly do I mean by this? Instead of making a claim about the value of large groups at parties, make a policy choice about what to treat as the value of large groups at parties. You are adding a new variable ‘deemed large group goodness’ between your highly uncertain beliefs and your actions. I’ll call this a ‘stance’. (I expect it isn’t quite clear what I mean by a ‘stance’ yet, but I’ll elaborate soon.) My proposal: to be ‘confident’ in the way that one might be from having strong beliefs, focus on having strong stances rather than strong beliefs.</p>
<p>Strong stances have many of the benefits of confident beliefs. With your new stance on large groups, when you are choosing whether to arrange chairs and snacks to discourage large groups, you skip over your uncertain beliefs and go straight to your stance. And since you decided it, it is certain, and you can rearrange chairs with the vigor and single-mindedness of a person who knowns where they stand. You can confidently declare your opposition to large groups, and unite followers in a broader crusade against giant circles. And if at the ensuing party people form a large group anyway and seem to be really enjoying it, you will hopefully notice this the way you wouldn’t if you were merely uncertain-leaning-against regarding the value of large groups.</p>
<p>That might have been confusing, since I don’t know of good words to describe the type of mental attitude I’m proposing. Here are some things I don’t mean by ‘I deem large group conversations to be bad’:</p>
<ol>
<li>“Large group conversations are bad” (i.e. this is not about what is true, though it is related to that.)</li>
<li>“I declare the truth to be ‘large group conversations are bad’” (i.e. This is not of a kind with beliefs. Is not directly about what is true about the world, or empirically observed, though it is influenced by these things. I do not have power over the truth.)</li>
<li>“I don’t like large group conversations”, or “I notice that I act in opposition to large group conversations” (i.e. is not a claim about my own feelings or inclinations, which would still be a passive observation about the world)</li>
<li>“The decision-theoretically optimal value to assign to large groups forming at parties is negative”, or “I estimate that the decision-theoretically optimal policy on large groups is opposition” (i.e. it is a choice, not an attempt to estimate a hidden feature of the world.)</li>
<li>“I commit to stopping large group conversations” (i.e. It is not a commitment, or directly claiming anything about my future actions.)</li>
<li>“I observe that I consistently seek to avert large group conversations” (this would be an observation about a consistency in my behavior, whereas here the point is to make a new thing (assign a value to a new variable?) that my future behavior may consistently make use of, if I want.)</li>
<li>“I intend to stop some large group conversations” (perhaps this one is closest so far, but a stance isn’t saying anything about the future or about actions—if it doesn’t get changed by the future, and then in future I want to take an action, I’ll probably call on it, but it isn’t ‘about’ that.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Perhaps what I mean is most like: ‘I have a policy of evaluating large group discussions at parties as bad’, though using ‘policy’ as a choice about an abstract variable that might apply to action, but not in the sense of a commitment.</p>
<p>What is going on here more generally? You are adding a new kind of abstract variable between beliefs and actions. A stance can be a bit like a policy choice on what you will treat as true, or on how you will evaluate something. Or it can also be its own abstract thing that doesn’t directly mean anything understandable in terms of the beliefs or actions nearby.</p>
<p>Some ideas we already use that are pretty close to stances are ‘X is my priority’, ‘I am in the dating market’, and arguably, ‘I am opposed to daschunds’. X being your priority is heavily influenced by your understanding of the consequences of X and its alternatives, but it is your choice, and it is not dishonest to prioritize a thing that is not important. To prioritize X isn’t a claim about the facts relevant to whether one would want to prioritize it. Prioritizing X also isn’t a commitment regarding your actions, though the purpose of having a ‘priority’ is for it to affect your actions. Your ‘priority’ is a kind of abstract variable added to your mental landscape to collect up a bunch of reasoning about the merits of different things, and package them for easy use in decisions.</p>
<p>Another way of looking at this is as a way of formalizing and concretifying the step where you look at your uncertain beliefs and then decide on a tentative answer and then run with it.</p>
<p>One can be confident in stances, because a stance is a choice, not a guess at a fact about the world. (Though my stance may contain uncertainty if I want, e.g. I could take a stance that large groups have a 75% chance of being bad on average.) So while my beliefs on a topic may be quite uncertain, my stance can be strong, in a sense that does some of the work we wanted from strong beliefs. Nonetheless, since stances are connected with facts and values, my stance can be wrong in the sense of not being the stance I should want to have, on further consideration.</p>
<p>In sum, stances:</p>
<ol>
<li>Are inputs to decisions in the place of some beliefs and values</li>
<li>Integrate those beliefs and values—to the extent that you want them to be—into a single reusable statement</li>
<li>Can be thought of as something like ‘policies’ on what will be treated as the truth (e.g. ‘I deem large groups bad’) or as new abstract variables between the truth and action (e.g. ‘I am prioritizing sleep’)</li>
<li>Are chosen by you, not implied by your epistemic situation (until some spoilsport comes up with a theory of optimal behavior)</li>
<li>therefore don’t permit uncertainty in one sense, and don’t require it in another (you know what your stance is, and your stance can be ‘X is bad’ rather than ‘X is 72% likely to be bad’), though you should be uncertain about how much you will like your stance on further reflection.</li>
</ol>
<p>I have found having stances somewhat useful, or at least entertaining, in the short time I have been trying having them, but it is more of a speculative suggestion with no other evidence behind it than trustworthy advice.</p>",KatjaGrace,katjagrace,KatjaGrace,

</style></head><body><p>Recently, I've been reading and enjoying Alex Turner's <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/7CdoznhJaLEKHwvJW"">Reframing Impact</a> sequence, but I realized that I have some rather idiosyncratic views regarding impact measures that I haven't really written up much yet. This post is my attempt at trying to communicate those views, as well as a response to some of the ideas in Alex's sequence.</p>
<h2>What can you do with an impact measure?</h2>
<p>In the ""Technical Appendix"" to his <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/7CdoznhJaLEKHwvJW/p/xCxeBSHqMEaP3jDvY"">first Reframing Impact post</a>, Alex argues that an impact measure might be ""the <em>first</em> proposed safeguard which maybe actually stops a powerful agent with an <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/iTpLAaPamcKyjmbFC/robust-delegation"">imperfect</a> objective from ruining things—without assuming anything about the objective.""</p>
<p>Personally, I am quite skeptical of this use case for impact measures. As it is phrased—and especially including the link to <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/iTpLAaPamcKyjmbFC/robust-delegation"">Robust Delegation</a>—Alex seems to be implying that an impact measure could be used to solve <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/r9tYkB2a8Fp4DN8yB/p/FkgsxrGf3QxhfLWHG"">inner alignment</a> issues arising from a model with a mesa-objective that is misaligned relative to the loss function used to train it. However, the standard way in which one uses an impact measure is by including it in said loss function, which doesn't do very much if the problem you're trying to solve is your model not being aligned with that loss.<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-ddGHtK56FzQqNBifj-1"" id=""fnref-ddGHtK56FzQqNBifj-1"">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>That being said, using an impact measure as part of your loss could be helpful for outer alignment. In my opinion, however, it seems like that requires your impact measure to capture basically everything you might care about (if you want it to actually solve outer alignment), in which case I don't really see what the impact measure is buying you anymore. I think this is especially true for me because I generally see amplification as being the right solution to outer alignment, which I don't think really benefits at all from adding an impact measure.<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-ddGHtK56FzQqNBifj-2"" id=""fnref-ddGHtK56FzQqNBifj-2"">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Alternatively, if you had a way of mechanistically verifying that a model behaves according to some impact measure, then I <em>would</em> say that you could use something like that to help with inner alignment. However, this is quite different from the standard procedure of including an impact measure as part of your loss. Instead of training your agent to <em>behave</em> according to your impact measure, you would instead have to train it to convince some overseer that it is <em>internally implementing</em> some algorithm which satisfies some minimal impact criterion. It's possible that this is what Alex actually has in mind in terms of how he wants to use impact measures, though it's worth noting that this use case is quite different than the standard one.</p>
<p>That being said, I'm skeptical of this use case as well. In my opinion, developing a <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/BKM8uQS6QdJPZLqCr/towards-a-mechanistic-understanding-of-corrigibility"">mechanistic understanding of corrigibility</a> seems more promising than developing a mechanistic understanding of impact. Alex <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/7CdoznhJaLEKHwvJW/p/xCxeBSHqMEaP3jDvY"">mentions corrigibility as a possible alternative to impact measures in his appendix</a>, though he notes that he's currently unsure what exactly the core principle behind corrigibility actually is. I think my post on <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/BKM8uQS6QdJPZLqCr/towards-a-mechanistic-understanding-of-corrigibility"">mechanistic corrigibility</a> gets at this somewhat, though there's definitely more work to be done there.</p>
<p>So, I've explained why I don't think impact measures are very promising for solving outer alignment or inner alignment—does that mean I think they're useless? No. In fact, I think a better understanding of impact could be extremely helpful, just not for any of the reasons I've talked about above.</p>
<h2>Value-neutrality verification</h2>
<p>In <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/9Dy5YRaoCxH9zuJqa/relaxed-adversarial-training-for-inner-alignment"">Relaxed adversarial training for inner alignment</a>, I argued that one way of mechanistically verifying an acceptability condition might be to split a model into a value-neutral piece (its optimization procedure) and a value-laden piece (its objective). If you can manage to get such a separation, then verifying <a href=""https://ai-alignment.com/training-robust-corrigibility-ce0e0a3b9b4d"">acceptability</a> just reduces to verifying that the value-laden piece has the right properties<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-ddGHtK56FzQqNBifj-3"" id=""fnref-ddGHtK56FzQqNBifj-3"">[3]</a></sup> and that the the value-neutral piece is actually value-neutral.</p>
<p>Why is this sort of a separation useful? Well, not only might it make mechanistically verifying acceptability much easier, it might also make <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/nRAMpjnb6Z4Qv3imF/the-strategy-stealing-assumption"">strategy-stealing</a> possible in a way which it otherwise might not be. In particular, one of the big problems with making strategy-stealing work under an informed-oversight-style scheme is that some strategies which are necessary to stay competitive might nevertheless be quite difficult to justify to an informed overseer. However, if we have a good understanding of the degree to which different algorithms are value-laden vs. value-neutral, then we can use that to short-circuit the normal evaluation process, enabling your agent to pursue any strategies which it can definitely demonstrate are value-neutral.</p>
<p>This is all well and good, but what does it even mean for an algorithm to be value-neutral and how would a model ever actually be able to demonstrate that? Well, here's what I want out of a value-neutrality guarantee: I want to consider some optimization procedure <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""f""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.519em; padding-right: 0.06em;"">f</span></span></span></span></span></span> to be value-neutral if, relative to some set of objectives <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""Y""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.182em;"">Y</span></span></span></span></span></span>, it doesn't tend to advantage any subset of those objectives over any other. In particular, I want it to be the case that if I start with some distribution of resources/utility/etc. over the different objectives <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""y \in Y""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.519em; padding-right: 0.006em;"">y</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">∈</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.182em;"">Y</span></span></span></span></span></span> then I don't want that distribution to change if I give each <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""y \in Y""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.519em; padding-right: 0.006em;"">y</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">∈</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.182em;"">Y</span></span></span></span></span></span> access to the optimization process <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""f""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.519em; padding-right: 0.06em;"">f</span></span></span></span></span></span>. Specifically, what this does is that it guarantees that the given optimization process is <em>compatible with strategy-stealing</em> in that, if we deploy a corrigible AI running such an optimization process in service of many different values in <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""Y""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.182em;"">Y</span></span></span></span></span></span>, it won't systematically advantage some over others.</p>
<p>Interestingly, however, what I've just described is quite similar to <em>Attainable Utility Preservation</em> (AUP), the impact measure put forward by <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09725"">Turner et al.</a> Specifically, AUP measures the extent to which an algorithm relative to some set of objectives advantages those objectives relative to doing nothing. This is slightly different from what I want, but it's quite similar in a way which I think is no accident. In particular, I think it's not hard to extend the math of AUP to apply to value-neutrality verification. That is, let <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""f: Y \to (X \to A)""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.519em; padding-right: 0.06em;"">f</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.151em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">:</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.182em;"">Y</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">→</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">(</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.024em;"">X</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">→</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">A</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">)</span></span></span></span></span></span> be some optimization procedure over objectives <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""Y""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.182em;"">Y</span></span></span></span></span></span>, states <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""X""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.024em;"">X</span></span></span></span></span></span>, and actions <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""A""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">A</span></span></span></span></span></span>.

<p>This is why I'm optimistic about impact measurement work: not because I expect it to greatly help with alignment via the straightforward methods in the first section, but because I think it's extremely applicable to value-neutrality verification, which I think could be quite important to making <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/9Dy5YRaoCxH9zuJqa/relaxed-adversarial-training-for-inner-alignment"">relaxed adversarial training</a> work. Furthermore, though like I said I think a lot of the current impact measure work is quite applicable to value-neutrality verification, I would be even more excited to see more work on impact measurement specifically from this perspective. (EDIT: I think there's a lot more work to be done here than just my writing down of <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\text{neutrality}""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mtext""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.519em;"">neutrality</span></span></span></span></span></span>.

<p>Furthermore, not only do I think that value-neutrality verification is the most compelling use case for impact measures, I also think that specifically <em>objective impact</em> can be understood as being <em>about</em> value-neutrality. In ""<a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/7CdoznhJaLEKHwvJW/p/coQCEe962sjbcCqB9"">The Gears of Impact</a>"" Alex argues that ""objective impact, instrumental convergence, opportunity cost, the colloquial meaning of 'power'—these all prove to be facets of <em>one</em> phenomenon, <em>one</em> structure."" In my opinion, I think value-neutrality should be added to that list. We can think of actions as having objective impact to the extent that they change the distribution over which values have control over which resources—that is, the extent to which they are not value-neutral. Or, phrased another way, actions have objective impact to the extent that they break the <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/nRAMpjnb6Z4Qv3imF/the-strategy-stealing-assumption"">strategy-stealing assumption</a>. Thus, even if you disagree with me that value-neutrality verification is the most compelling use case for impact measures, I still think you should believe that if you want to understand objective impact, it's worth trying to understand strategy-stealing and value neutrality, because I think they're all secretly talking about the same thing.</p>

Could be considered part of an unstructured sequence titled &apos;towards fewer type errors in metaphilosophy&apos;</em></p><p><em>Summary: When moving up or down the ladder of abstraction you&apos;re forced to make choices about restriction or relaxation of domain of relevance. Don&apos;t just reason about the valid range/scope, reason about your reasoning about the valid range/scope and ask what sort of operations you&apos;d need to be doing to make a different choice seem valid. This resolves many types of confusions and is a crux identifier for 2-place confusions.</em></p><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Korzybski"">Alfred Korzybski </a>directs us to develop the faculty to be <a href=""https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/7Pxx7kSQejX2MM2tE/why-do-social-movements-fail-two-concrete-examples?commentId=4X8XFuYiaNCSPfLWn"">conscious of the act of abstracting</a>. This means that that one has <a href=""https://www.patreon.com/posts/23826125"">meta cognitive awareness</a> when one does things like engage in the substitution effect, analogical reasoning, shifting the coarse-grainedness of an argument, use of the &apos;to be&apos; verb form, shifting from one <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Marr_(neuroscientist)#Levels_of_analysis"">Marr Level</a> to another in mid sentence etc. One of the most important skills that winds up developed as a result of such training is much more immediate awareness of what Korzybski calls the multiordinality of words, which one will be familiar with if you have read <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/SGB7Y5WERh4skwtnb"">A Human&apos;s Guide to Words</a> (esp. <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/FaJaCgqBKphrDzDSj/37-ways-that-words-can-be-wrong"">24 and 36</a>) or are otherwise familiar with the <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wittgenstein/#LangGameFamiRese"">Wittgensteinian shift</a> in analytic philosophy (related: the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indeterminacy_of_translation"">Indeterminacy of Translation</a>). In short, many words are underdetermined in their referents along more than one dimension, leading to communication problems both between people and internally (for an intuitive example, one can imagine people talking past each other in a discussion of causation when they are discussing <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_causes"">different senses of Cause </a>without realizing it). </p><p>I want to outline what one might call <em>second order multiordinal words</em> or maybe <em>schematic thinking.</em> With multiordinal words, one is aware of all the values that a word could be referring to. With schematic thinking one is also aware of all the words that could have occupied the space that word occupies. Kind of like seeing everything as an already filled out <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs"">madlibs</a> and reconstructing the unfilled out version.</p><p>This may sound needlessly abstract but you&apos;re already familiar with a famous example. One of Charlie Munger&apos;s most famous heuristics is inversion. With inversion we can check various ways we might be confused by reversing the meaning of one part of a chain of reasoning and seeing how that affects things. Instead of forward chaining we backwards chain, we prepend &apos;not&apos; or &apos;doesn&apos;t&apos; to various parts of the plan to construct <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-mortem"">premortems</a>, we invert whatever <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-so_story"">just-so story</a> a babbling philosopher said and see if it still makes sense to see if their explanation <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/G5eMM3Wp3hbCuKKPE/proving-too-much"">proves too much</a>. </p><p>I claim that this is a specific, actionable instance of schematic thinking. The generalization of this is that one doesn&apos;t just restrict oneself to opposites, and doesn&apos;t restrict oneself to a single word at a time, though that remains an easy, simple way to break out of mental habit and see more than one possibility for any particular meaning structure.</p><p>Let&apos;s take first order indeterminacy and apply this and see what happens. To start with you can do a simple inversion of them and see what happens.</p><p>First example of first order indeterminacy: universal quantifiers</p><p> &quot;all, always, every, never, everyone, no one, no body, none&quot; etc</p><p>We already recognize that perverse generalizations of this form cause us problems that can often be repaired by<a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/XosKB3mkvmXMZ3fBQ/specificity-your-brain-s-superpower""> getting specific</a>. The additional question schematic thinking has us ask is: among the choices I can make, what influences me to make this one? Are those good reasons? What if you inverted that choice (all-&gt;none, etc), or made a different one?</p><p>Second example of first order indeterminacy: modal operators</p><p>confusion of possibility and necessity, &quot;should, should not, must, must not, have to, need to, it is necessary&quot; etc</p><p>The additional question we ask here as we convert &apos;shoulds&apos; to &apos;coulds&apos; and &apos;musts&apos; to &apos;mays&apos; is what sorts of mental moves are we making as we do this? </p><p>Third example of first order indeterminacy: unspecified verbs</p><p>&quot;they are too trusting, that was rude, we will benefit from that, I tried really hard&quot;</p><p>The additional question we ask as we get more specific about what happened is &apos;why are we choosing this level of coarse grainedness?&apos; After all, depending on the context someone could accuse us of being too specific, or not being specific enough. We have intuitions about when those accusations are reasonable. How does that work?</p><p>Conclusion:</p><p>This might seem a bit awkward and unnecessary. The concrete benefit it has brought me is that it gives me a starting point when I am reading or listening to a line of reasoning that strikes me as off in some way, but I can&apos;t quite put my finger on how. By seeing many of the distinctions being made to construct the argument as arbitrary and part of a space of possible distinctions I can start rephrasing the argument in a way that makes more sense to me. I then have a much better chance of making substantive critiques/cruxing (or alternatively, becoming convinced) rather than just arguing over misunderstandings the whole time. I&apos;ve found many philosophical arguments hinge on pulling a switcheroo at some key juncture. I think many people intuitively pick up on this and that this is why people dismiss many philosophical arguments, and I think they are <em>usually</em> correct to do so. </p>",romeostevensit,romeostevensit,romeostevensit,

The punch line: an event is <strong>impactful to an agent</strong> if it changes the agent&apos;s <strong>ability to get what it wants</strong>. This is <em>Attainable Utility (AU) theory</em>. To quote the sequence: &quot;How could something possibly be a big deal to us if it <em>doesn&apos;t</em> change our ability to get what we want? How could something <em>not</em> matter to us if it <em>does</em> change our ability to get what we want?&quot;</p><p>Some implications and other ideas:</p><p>- Impact is <em>relative to an agent</em>: a new church is more impactful if you are a Christian than if not.</p><p>- Some impact is <em>objective</em>: getting money is impactful to almost any agent that knows what money is.</p><p>- Impact is <em>relative to expectations</em>: A burglar robbing your home is impactful to you (you weren&apos;t expecting it) but not very impactful to the burglar (who had planned it out). However, if the burglar was unsure if the burglary would be successful, than success/failure would be impactful to them.</p><p>While this may seem obvious, <u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01186"">past work</a></u> (<u><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/d1a19c140226/alignment-newsletter-10"">AN #10</a></u>) has talked about impact as being caused by changes in state. While of course any impact does involve a change in state, this is the wrong level of abstraction to reason about impact: fundamentally, impact is related to what we care about.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> To quote myself from a discussion with Alex, &quot;you&apos;re looking at the optimal Q-function for the optimal utility function and saying &apos;this is a good measure of what we care about&apos; and of course I agree with that&quot;. (Although this is a bit inaccurate -- it&apos;s not the optimal Q-function, but the Q-function relative to what we expect and know.)</p><p>This may be somewhat of a surprise, given that I&apos;ve been <u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/kCY9dYGLoThC3aG7w/best-reasons-for-pessimism-about-impact-of-impact-measures#qAy66Wza8csAqWxiB"">pessimistic</a></u> about impact measures in the past. However, my position is that it&apos;s difficult to simultaneously get three desiderata: value-agnosticism, avoidance of catastrophes, and usefulness. This characterization of impact is very explicitly dependent on values, and so doesn&apos;t run afoul of that. (Also, it just makes intuitive sense.)</p><p>This part of the sequence did change some of my thinking on impact measures as well. In particular, the sequence makes a distinction between <em>objective</em> impact, which applies to all (or most) agents, and <em>value</em> impact. This is similar to the idea of <u><a href=""https://selfawaresystems.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/ai_drives_final.pdf"">convergent instrumental subgoals</a></u>, and the idea that <u><a href=""https://openai.com/blog/emergent-tool-use/"">large-scale multiagent training</a></u> (<u><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/3d4e6c2c206f/an-65learning-useful-skills-by-watching-humans-play"">AN#65</a></u>) can lead to generally useful behaviors that can be applied to novel tasks. It seems plausible to me that we could make value-agnostic impact measures that primarily penalize this objective impact, and this might be enough to avoid catastrophes. This would prevent us from using AI for big, impactful tasks, but could allow for AI systems that pursue small, limited tasks. I suspect we&apos;ll see thoughts along these lines in the next parts of this sequence.</p><h1><strong>Technical AI alignment</strong></h1><h3><strong>Technical agendas and prioritization</strong></h3><p><u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/bnY3L48TtDrKTzGRb/ai-safety-success-stories"">AI Safety &quot;Success Stories&quot;</a></u> <em>(Wei Dai)</em> (summarized by Matthew): It is difficult to measure the usefulness of various alignment approaches without clearly understanding what type of future they end up being useful for. This post collects &quot;Success Stories&quot; for AI -- disjunctive scenarios in which alignment approaches are leveraged to ensure a positive future. Whether these scenarios come to pass will depend critically on background assumptions, such as whether we can achieve global coordination, or solve the most ambitious safety issues. Mapping these success stories can help us prioritize research.</p><p><strong>Matthew&apos;s opinion:</strong> This post does not exhaust the possible success stories, but it gets us a lot closer to being able to look at a particular approach and ask, &quot;Where exactly does this help us?&quot; My guess is that most research ends up being only minimally helpful for the long run, and so I consider inquiry like this to be very useful for cause prioritization.</p><h3><strong>Preventing bad behavior</strong></h3><p><u><a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01074"">Formal Language Constraints for Markov Decision Processes</a></u> <em>(Eleanor Quint et al)</em> (summarized by Rohin): Within the framework of RL, the authors propose using constraints defined by DFAs (deterministic finite automata) in order to eliminate safety failures, or to prevent agents from exploring clearly ineffective policies (which would accelerate learning). Constraints can be defined on any auxiliary information that can be computed from the &quot;base&quot; MDP. A constraint could either restrict the action space, forcing the agent to take an action that doesn&apos;t violate the constraint, which they term &quot;hard&quot; constraints; or a constraint could impose a penalty on the agent, thus acting as a form of reward shaping, which they term a &quot;soft&quot; constraint. They consider two constraints: one that prevents the agent from &quot;dithering&quot; (going left, then right, then left, then right), and one that prevents the agent from &quot;overactuating&quot; (going in the same direction four times in a row). They evaluate their approach with these constraints on Atari games and Mujoco environments, and show that they lead to increased reward and decreased constraint violations.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> This method seems like a good way to build in domain knowledge about what kinds of action sequences are unlikely to work in a domain, which can help accelerate learning. Both of the constraints in the experiments do this. The paper also suggests using the technique to enforce safety constraints, but the experiments don&apos;t involve any safety constraints, and conceptually there do seem to be two big obstacles. First, the constraints will depend on state, but it is very hard to write such constraints given access only to actions and high-dimensional pixel observations. Second, you can only prevent constraint violations by removing actions one timestep before the constraint is violated: if there is an action that will inevitably lead to a constraint violation in 10 timesteps, there&apos;s no way in this framework to not take that action. (Of course, you can use a soft constraint, but this is then the standard technique of reward shaping.)</p><p>In general, methods like this face a major challenge: how do you specify the safety constraint that you would like to avoid violating? I&apos;d love to see more research on how to create specifications for formal analysis.</p><h3><strong>Interpretability</strong></h3><p><u><a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.12969"">Counterfactual States for Atari Agents via Generative Deep Learning</a></u> <em>(Matthew L. Olson et al)</em></p><h3><strong>Adversarial examples</strong></h3><p><u><a href=""http://gradientscience.org/robust_reps/"">Robustness beyond Security: Representation Learning</a></u> <em>(Logan Engstrom et al)</em> (summarized by Cody): Earlier this year, a <u><a href=""http://gradientscience.org/adv/"">provocative paper</a></u> (<u><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/4a1b3c4249ae/an-62are-adversarial-examples-caused-by-real-but-imperceptible-features"">AN #62</a></u>) out of MIT claimed that adversarial perturbations weren&#x2019;t just spurious correlations, but were, at least in some cases, features that generalize to the test set. A subtler implied point of the paper was that robustness to adversarial examples wasn&#x2019;t a matter of resolving the model&#x2019;s misapprehensions, but rather one of removing the model&#x2019;s sensitivity to features that would be too small for a human to perceive. If we do this via adversarial training, we get so-called &#x201C;robust representations&#x201D;. The same group has now put out another paper, asking the question: are robust representations also human-like representations?</p><p>To evaluate how human-like the representations are, they propose the following experiment: take a source image, and optimize it until its representations (penultimate layer activations) match those of some target image. If the representations are human-like, the result of this optimization should look (to humans) very similar to the target image. (They call this property &#x201C;invertibility&#x201D;.) Normal image classifiers fail miserably at this test: the image looks basically like the source image, making it a classic adversarial example. Robust models on the other hand pass the test, suggesting that robust representations usually are human-like. They provide further evidence by showing that you can run feature visualization without regularization and get meaningful results (existing methods result in noise if you don&#x2019;t regularize).</p><p><strong>Cody&apos;s opinion:</strong> I found this paper clear, well-written, and straightforward in its empirical examination of how the representations learned by standard and robust models differ. I also have a particular interest in this line of research, since I have thought for a while that we should be more clear about the fact that adversarially-susceptible models aren&#x2019;t wrong in some absolute sense, but relative to human perception in particular.</p><p><strong>Rohin&#x2019;s opinion:</strong> I agree with Cody above, and have a few more thoughts.</p><p>Most of the evidence in this paper suggests that the learned representations are &#x201C;human-like&#x201D; in the sense that two images that have similar representations must also be perceptually similar (to humans). That is, by enforcing that &#x201C;small change in pixels&#x201D; implies &#x201C;small change in representations&#x201D;, you seem to get for free the converse: &#x201C;small change in representations&#x201D; implies &#x201C;small change in pixels&#x201D;. This wasn&#x2019;t obvious to me: a priori, each feature could have corresponded to 2+ &#x201C;clusters&#x201D; of inputs.</p><p>The authors also seem to be making a claim that the representations are semantically similar to the ones humans use. I don&#x2019;t find the evidence for this as compelling. For example, they claim that when putting the &#x201C;stripes&#x201D; feature on a picture of an animal, only the animal gets the stripes and not the background. However, when I tried it myself in the interactive visualization, it looked like a lot of the background was also getting stripes.</p><p>One typical regularization for <u><a href=""https://distill.pub/2017/feature-visualization/"">feature visualization</a></u> is to jitter the image while optimizing it, which seems similar to selecting for robustness to imperceptible changes, so it makes sense that using robust features helps with feature visualization. That said, there are several other techniques for regularization, and the authors didn&#x2019;t need any of them, which is very interesting. On the other hand, their visualizations don&apos;t look as good to me as those from other papers.</p><p><strong>Read more:</strong> <u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00945v2"">Paper: Adversarial Robustness as a Prior for Learned Representations</a></u></p><p><u><a href=""http://gradientscience.org/robust_apps/"">Robustness beyond Security: Computer Vision Applications</a></u> <em>(Shibani Santurkar, Dimitris Tsipras, Brandon Tran, Andrew Ilyas, Logan Engstrom et al)</em> (summarized by Rohin): Since a robust model seems to have significantly more &quot;human-like&quot; features (see post above), it should be able to help with many of the tasks in computer vision. The authors demonstrate results on image generation, image-to-image translation, inpainting, superresolution and interactive image manipulation: all of which are done simply by optimizing the image to maximize the probability of a particular class label or the value of a particular learned feature.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> This provides more evidence of the utility of robust features, though all of the comments from the previous paper apply here as well.

For example, suppose we want an agent to collect all of the blue blocks in a room together. We might simply reward it for having blue in its observations: this might work great if the agent only has the ability to pick up and move blocks, but won&apos;t work well if the agent has a paintbrush and blue paint. This makes the reward designer&apos;s job much more difficult. However, the designer could use techniques that don&apos;t require a reward on individual observations, such as rewards that can depend on the agent&apos;s internal cognition (as in iterated amplification), or rewards that can depend on histories (as in <u><a href=""https://deepmind.com/blog/learning-through-human-feedback/"">Deep RL from Human Preferences</a></u>).</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> I certainly agree that we want to avoid reward functions defined on observations, and this is one reason why. It seems like a more general version of the wireheading argument to me, and applies even if you think that the AI won&apos;t be able to wirehead, as long as it is capable enough to find other plans for getting high reward besides the one the designer intended.</p><h1><strong>Other progress in AI</strong></h1><h3><strong>Reinforcement learning</strong></h3><p><u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.03568"">Behaviour Suite for Reinforcement Learning</a></u> <em>(Ian Osband et al)</em> (summarized by Zach): Collecting clear, informative and scalable problems that capture important aspects about how to design general and efficient learning algorithms is difficult. Many current environments used to evaluate RL algorithms introduce confounding variables that make new algorithms difficult to evaluate.

The idea of these experiments is to capture core issues, such as &apos;exploration&apos; or &apos;memory&apos;, in a way that can be easily tested or evaluated. The main contribution of this project is an open-source project called bsuite, which instantiates all experiments in code and automates the evaluation and analysis of any RL agent on bsuite.

I think this paper captures a lot of the notions of what makes an agent &apos;good&apos; in a way that seems readily generalizable. The evaluation time on the suite is reasonable, no more than 30 minutes per experiment. Additionally, the ability to produce automated summary reports in standard formats is a nice feature.

I'm reasonably happy with my 

<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/bass-whistle"">Bass Whistle</a>,
where I can whistle and have it come out as a decent sounding bass.
I've been using it when playing mandolin in a duo, and it fits well
there.  When playing piano or with a piano player, however, there's
already bass so something that falls in a different place in the
overall sound would be better.  That could be melody, 

<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/double-tongue-whistling"">though I can't whistle fast enough
for everything</a>, but probably something simpler: harmonies, riffs,
horn lines.



</p><p>

When I take my current software, optimized for bass, and tell it to
synthesize notes a few octaves up, it sounds terrible:

</p>

<ul>
<li>Raw whistled input:<br /> 
(<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/whistle-example-complex-input-trimmed.mp3"">mp3</a>)</li>
<li>Bass version (needs headphones or good speakers):<br />  (<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/whistle-example-bass-1.mp3"">mp3</a>)</li>
<li>Treble version:<br />  (<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/whistle-example-treble-1.mp3"">mp3</a>)</li>
</ul>



<p>

I'm using simple additive synthesis with the first four harmonics,
which means adding together four sine waves.  I think what's going on
is that higher notes need more complexity to sound good?  Playing
around with distortion and fading the harmonics at different rates it
sounds a bit more interesting:

</p>

<ul>
<li>Adding distortion:<br /> (<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/whistle-example-treble-dist-1.mp3"">mp3</a>)</li>
<li>Adding fade:<br /> (<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/whistle-example-treble-fade-1.mp3"">mp3</a>)</li>
<li>Adding both:<br /> (<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/whistle-example-treble-fade-dist.mp3"">mp3</a>)</li>
</ul>



<p>

I'm still not very happy with it, though.  It sounds artificial and
silly.  There are good synthesizers, the product of decades of work on
turning ""play this note at this time"" into good sounding audio, so
perhaps I could use my pitch detection to drive a standard
synthesizer?

</p>

<p>

I made some <a href=""https://github.com/jeffkaufman/pitch-detect"">stand-alone open
source software</a> that pipes the pitch detection through to MIDI.
This was kind of tricky: MIDI doesn't have a way to say ""play this
frequency"".  Instead you just have ""play this note"" and ""bend the note
by this much"".  How to interpret pitch bend is up to the synthesizer,
but generally the range is ±2 half steps.  So we need some
math:

</p>

<pre>
in: wavelength
in: sample_rate
in: current_note

# Convert from ""this wave is 23.2 samples long""
# to ""the frequency is 1896.6 HZ"".
frequency = sample_rate / wavelength

# MIDI is equal tempered, with each octave divided
# into twelve logarithmically equal pieces.  Take
# A440 as a reference point, so represent our
# 1896.6 HZ as ""25.29 half steps above A440"":
distance_from_a440 = 12 * log2(frequency / 440)

# A440 is A4, or midi note 69, so this is 94.29.
fractional_note = 69 + distance_from_a440

# MIDI uses a note + bend encoding.  Stay on the
# same note if possible to avoid spurious attacks.
if (current_note and
    current_note - 2 &lt; fractional_note
                     &lt; current_note + 2)
  integer_note = current_note
else
  integer_note = round(fractional_note)

# To compute the pitch bend, we first find the
# fractional part of the note, in this case 0.29:
fractional_bend = fractional_note - integer_note

# The bend will always be between -2 and +2, a
# whole tone up or down.  MIDI uses 14 bits to
# represent the range between -2 and +2, so -2 is 0
# and +2 is 2^14.  The midpoint is 2^13, 8192:
integer_bend = round((1 + fractional_bend / 2)
                      * 8192 - 1)

# The bend is 14bits which gets split into two 7-bit
# values.  We can do this with masking and shifting.
bend_least_significant = integer_bend &amp; 0b1111111

bend_most_significant =
    (integer_bend &amp; 0b11111110000000) &gt;&gt; 7

out: integer_note
out: bend_least_significant
out: bend_most_significant
</pre>



<p>

Initially I screwed this up, and thought pitch bend was conventionally
±1 semitone, and didn't end up <a href=""https://github.com/jeffkaufman/pitch-detect/commit/422bebcae56451ef2efe30858a6ae5e42a9483da"">catching
the bug</a> until I wrote up this post.

</p>

<p>

I have this working reasonably well, except that when I bend more than
a whole note I get spurious attacks.  Say I slide from A to C: the
slide from A to Bb to B can all be done with pitch bend, but then once
I go above B the system needs to turn off bent A and start working
with a new note.  I would love to suppress the attack for that note,
but I don't know any way to communicate that in MIDI. I don't know
what people with existing <a href=""http://www.rogerlinndesign.com/linnstrument.html"">continuous
pitch</a> <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_Fingerboard"">electronic
instruments</a> do?

</p>

<p>

A second problem I've run into is that what sounds like a steady
whistled pitch actually has a lot of tiny variations.  Consider this
input:  (<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/whistle-example-steady-whistle-trimmed.mp3"">mp3</a>)

</p>

<p>

This sounds reasonably steady to me, but it isn't really.  Here are
some successive zero crossings:

<p>

My synth doesn't mind, and just passes the variability through to the
listener, where it's not a problem.  I track where in the wave we are,
and slowly adjust the rate we move through the wave to match the
desired frequency:

</p>

<ul>
<li>Bass output:<br />
 (<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/whistle-example-bass-level.mp3"">mp3</a>)</li>
<li>Pure sine treble output:<br />
 (<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/whistle-example-high-sine-level.mp3"">mp3</a>)</li>
</ul>

When I pass that variability into some regular synths, however, even
when I don't cross note boundaries I get a wavery output.  I think
this may be another artifact of using a synth that isn't designed for
continuous pitch input?  Or possibly the problem is that real MIDI
pitch wheels don't just suddenly jump from +23% to +49% over a
40ms period, and so they haven't needed to design for it?



<p>

I can fix this some on my end by averaging the most recent pitches to
smooth out the variability, but then it stops feeling so responsive
(and quick slides don't work, and if I start a note slightly sour it
takes longer to fix it).  I think the answer is probably ""find a
better synth"" but I'm not sure how to figure out what to use.

</p>

<p>

Still, I like this a lot, and I think there's something here.  If
you have a mac and want to play with this, the code is <a href=""https://github.com/jeffkaufman/pitch-detect"">on github</a>.

Alexander argues that the expanded sense draws the category boundaries of ""lying"" too widely in a way that would make the word less useful. The hypothesis that predicts everything predicts nothing: in order for ""Kevin lied"" to <em>mean something</em>, some possible states-of-affairs need to be identified as <em>not</em> lying, so that the statement ""Kevin lied"" can correspond to <a href=""http://yudkowsky.net/rational/technical/"">redistributing conserved probability mass</a> <em>away from</em> ""not lying"" states-of-affairs <em>onto</em> ""lying"" states-of-affairs.</p>
<p>All of this is entirely correct. But Jessica Taylor (whose post <a href=""https://unstableontology.com/2019/07/11/the-ai-timelines-scam/"">""The AI Timelines Scam""</a> inspired ""Against Lie Inflation"") wasn't arguing that <em>everything</em> is lying; she was just using a <em>more</em> permissive conception of lying than the one Alexander prefers, such that Alexander didn't think that Taylor's definition could stably and consistently identify non-lies.</p>
<p>Concerning Alexander's arguments against the expanded definition, I find I have one strong objection (that appeal-to-consequences is an invalid form of reasoning for optimal-categorization questions for essentially the same reason as it is for questions of simple fact), and one more speculative objection (that our intuitive ""folk theory"" of lying may actually be empirically mistaken). Let me explain.</p>
<p>(A small clarification: for myself, I notice that I <em>also</em> tend to frown on the expanded sense of ""lying"". But the <em>reasons</em> for frowning matter! People who superficially agree on a conclusion but for <em>different reasons</em>, are <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/n4ukoQzkgbAqpzqb5/argue-politics-with-your-best-friends"">not really on the same page</a>!)</p>
<h3>Appeals to Consequences Are Invalid</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no method of reasoning more common, and yet none more blamable, than, in philosophical disputes, to endeavor the refutation of any hypothesis, by a pretense of its dangerous consequences[.]</p>
<p>—<a href=""https://www.bartleby.com/37/3/12.html"">David Hume</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alexander contrasts the imagined consequences of the expanded definition of ""lying"" becoming more widely accepted, to a world that uses the restricted definition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[E]veryone is much angrier. In the restricted-definition world, a few people write posts suggesting that there may be biases affecting the situation. In the expanded-definition world, those same people write posts accusing the other side of being liars perpetrating a fraud. I am willing to listen to people suggesting I might be biased, but if someone calls me a liar I'm going to be pretty angry and go into defensive mode. I'll be less likely to hear them out and adjust my beliefs, and more likely to try to attack them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But this is an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_consequences"">appeal to consequences</a>. <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/P3FQNvnW8Cz42QBuA/dialogue-on-appeals-to-consequences"">Appeals to consequences</a> are invalid because they represent a map–territory confusion, an attempt to optimize our <em>description</em> of reality at the expense of our ability to describe reality <em>accurately</em> (which we need in order to <em>actually</em> optimize reality).</p>
<p>(Again, the appeal is still invalid even if the conclusion—in this case, that unconscious rationalization shouldn't count as ""lying""—might be true for <em>other reasons</em>.)</p>
<p>Some aspiring epistemic rationalists like to call this the <a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Litany_of_Tarski"">""Litany of Tarski""</a>. <em>If</em> Elijah is lying (with respect to whatever the <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/esRZaPXSHgWzyB2NL/where-to-draw-the-boundaries"">optimal category boundary</a> for ""lying"" turns out to be according to <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/FaJaCgqBKphrDzDSj/37-ways-that-words-can-be-wrong"">our standard Bayesian philosophy of language</a>), <em>then</em> I desire to believe that Elijah is lying (with respect to the optimal category boundary according to ... <em>&amp;c.</em>). <em>If</em> Elijah is <em>not</em> lying (with respect to ... <em>&amp;c.</em>), <em>then</em> I desire to believe that Elijah is <em>not</em> lying.</p>
<p>If the one comes to me and says, ""Elijah is not lying; to support this claim, I offer this-and-such evidence of his sincerity,"" then this is right and proper, and I am eager to examine the evidence presented.</p>
<p>If the one comes to me and says, ""You should choose to define <em>lying</em> such that Elijah is not lying, because if you said that he was lying, then he might feel angry and defensive,"" this is <em>insane</em>. The map is not the territory! If Elijah's behavior is, <em>in fact</em>, deceptive—if he says things that cause people who trust him to be worse at <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/a7n8GdKiAZRX86T5A/making-beliefs-pay-rent-in-anticipated-experiences"">anticipating their experiences</a> when he reasonably <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/3buXtNiSK8gcRLMSG/possibility-and-could-ness"">could</a> have avoided this—I can't make his behavior not-deceptive by <em>changing the meanings of words</em>.</p>
<p>Now, I <em>agree</em> that it might very well empirically be the case that if I <em>say</em> that Elijah is lying (where Elijah can hear me), he might get angry and defensive, which could have a variety of negative social consequences. But that's not an argument for changing the definition of lying; that's an argument that I have an incentive to lie about whether I think Elijah is lying! (Though <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xdwbX9pFEr7Pomaxv/meta-honesty-firming-up-honesty-around-its-edge-cases#1__Glomarization_can_t_practically_cover_many_cases_"">Glomarizing</a> about whether I think he's lying might be an even better play.)</p>
<p>Alexander is concerned that people might strategically equivocate between different definitions of ""lying"" as an unjust social attack against the innocent, using the classic <a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/11/03/all-in-all-another-brick-in-the-motte/"">motte-and-bailey</a> maneuver: first, argue that someone is ""lying (expanded definition)"" (the motte), then switch to treating them as if they were guilty of ""lying (restricted definition)"" (the bailey) and hope no one notices.</p>
<p>So, I agree that <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/shoMpaoZypfkXv84Y/variable-question-fallacies"">this is a very real problem</a>. But it's worth noting that the problem of equivocation between <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4FcxgdvdQP45D6Skg/disguised-queries"">different category boundaries associated with the same word</a> applies <em>symmetrically</em>: if it's possible to use an expanded definition of a socially-disapproved category as the motte and a restricted definition as the bailey in an unjust attack against the innocent, then it's <em>also</em> possible to use an expanded definition as the bailey and a restricted definition as the motte in an unjust defense of the guilty. Alexander writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The whole reason that rebranding lesser sins as ""lying"" is tempting is because everyone knows ""lying"" refers to something very bad.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right—and conversely, because everyone knows that ""lying"" refers to something very bad, it's tempting to rebrand lies as lesser sins. Ruby Bloom <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/QB9eXzzQWBhq9YuB8/rationalizing-and-sitting-bolt-upright-in-alarm#R9kEwAz8YbQTWGPsB"">explains what this looks like in the wild</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I worked in a workplace where lying was commonplace, conscious, and system 2. Clients asking if we could do something were told ""yes, we've already got that feature (we hadn't) and we already have several clients successfully using that (we hadn't)."" Others were invited to be part an ""existing beta program"" <em>alongside others just like them</em> (in fact, they would have been the very first). When I objected, I was told ""no one wants to be the first, so you have to say that.""</p>

<p>—then the asymmetrical fear of false-positive identifications of ""lying"" but not false-negatives—along with the focus on ""bad actors"", ""stigmatization"", ""attacks"", <em>&amp;c.</em>—just looks <em>weird</em>.

<h3>The Optimal Categorization Depends on the Actual Psychology of Deception</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Deception</em><br>
<em>My life seems like it's nothing but</em><br>

<em>A big charade</em></p>

<em>I never meant to play those games</em></p>
<p>—<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKs0eQHZRs"">""Deception""</a> by Jem and the Holograms</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even if the fear of rhetorical warfare isn't a legitimate reason to avoid calling things lies (at least privately), we're still left with the main objection that ""lying"" is a <em>different thing</em> from ""rationalizing"" or ""being biased"". Everyone is biased in some way or another, but to <em>lie</em> is <a href=""https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/lie#Etymology_2"">""[t]o give false information intentionally with intent to deceive.""</a> Sometimes it might make sense to use the word ""lie"" in a <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yCWPkLi8wJvewPbEp/the-noncentral-fallacy-the-worst-argument-in-the-world"">noncentral</a> sense, as when we speak of ""lying to oneself"" or say ""Oops, I lied"" in reaction to being corrected. But it's important that these senses be explicitly acknowledged as noncentral and not conflated with the central case of knowingly speaking falsehood with intent to deceive—as Alexander says, conflating the two can only be to the benefit of <em>actual liars</em>.</p>
<p>Why would anyone disagree with this obvious ordinary view, if they <em>weren't</em> trying to get away with the sneaky motte-and-bailey social attack that Alexander is so worried about?</p>
<p>Perhaps because the ordinary view relies an implied theory of human psychology that we have reason to believe is false? What if <em>conscious</em> intent to deceive is typically absent in the most common cases of people saying things that (they would be capable of realizing upon being pressed) they know not to be true? Alexander writes—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So how will people decide where to draw the line [if egregious motivated reasoning can count as ""lying""]? My guess is: in a place drawn by bias and motivated reasoning, same way they decide everything else. The outgroup will be lying liars, and the ingroup will be decent people with ordinary human failings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But if the word ""lying"" is to actually <em>mean something</em> rather than just being a weapon, then the ingroup and the outgroup <em>can't both be right</em>. If <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/28bAMAxhoX3bwbAKC/are-your-enemies-innately-evil"">symmetry considerations</a> make us doubt that one group is really that much more honest than the other, that would seem to imply that <em>either</em> both groups are composed of decent people with ordinary human failings, <em>or</em> that both groups are composed of lying liars. The first description certainly <em>sounds nicer</em>, but as aspiring epistemic rationalists, we're <em>not allowed to care</em> about which descriptions sound nice; we're <em>only</em> allowed to care about which descriptions match reality.</p>
<p>And if all of the concepts available to us in our native language fail to match reality in different ways, then we have a tough problem that may require us to innovate.</p>
<p>The philosopher <a href=""https://mises.org/library/rothbards-left-and-right-forty-years-later"">Roderick T. Long writes</a>—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Suppose I were to invent a new word, ""zaxlebax,"" and define it as ""a metallic sphere, like the Washington Monument."" That's the definition—""a metallic sphere, like the Washington Monument."" In short, I build my ill-chosen example into the definition. Now some linguistic subgroup might start using the term ""zaxlebax"" as though it just meant ""metallic sphere,"" or as though it just meant ""something of the same kind as the Washington Monument."" And that's fine. But my definition incorporates both, and thus conceals the false assumption that the Washington Monument is a metallic sphere; any attempt to use the term ""zaxlebax,"" meaning what I mean by it, involves the user in this false assumption.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If self-deception is as ubiquitous in human life as authors such as <a href=""http://www.overcomingbias.com/tag/hypocrisy"">Robin Hanson</a> argue (and if you're reading this blog, this should not be a new idea to you!), then the ordinary concept of ""lying"" may actually be analogous to Long's ""zaxlebax"": the standard <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/HsznWM9A7NiuGsp28/extensions-and-intensions""><em>intensional</em> definition</a> (""speaking falsehood with conscious intent to deceive""/""a metallic sphere"") fails to match the most common extensional examples that we want to use the word for (""people motivatedly saying convenient things without bothering to check whether they're true""/""the Washington Monument"").</p>
<p>Arguing for this <em>empirical</em> thesis about human psychology is beyond the scope of this post. But <em>if</em> we live in a sufficiently Hansonian world where the <em>ordinary</em> meaning of ""lying"" fails to carve reality at the joints, then authors are faced with a tough choice: either be involved in the false assumptions of the standard believed-to-be-central intensional definition, or be deprived of the use of common <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/H7Rs8HqrwBDque8Ru/expressive-vocabulary"">expressive vocabulary</a>. As Ben Hoffman <a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/07/16/against-lie-inflation/#comment-777559"">points out in the comments</a> to ""Against Lie Inflation"", an earlier Scott Alexander didn't seem shy about calling people liars in his classic 2014 post <a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/02/23/in-favor-of-niceness-community-and-civilization/"">""In Favor of Niceness, Community, and Civilization""</a>—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Politicians lie, but not <em>too much</em>. Take the top story on Politifact Fact Check today. Some Republican claimed his supposedly-maverick Democratic opponent actually voted with Obama's economic policies 97 percent of the time. Fact Check explains that the statistic used was actually for all votes, not just economic votes, and that members of Congress typically have to have &gt;90% agreement with their president because of the way partisan politics work. <strong>So it's a lie, and is properly listed as one.</strong> [bolding mine —ZMD] But it's a lie based on slightly misinterpreting a real statistic. He didn't just totally make up a number. He didn't even just make up something else, like ""My opponent personally helped design most of Obama's legislation"".</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Was</em> the politician consciously lying? Or did he (or his staffer) arrive at the <a href=""https://everythingstudies.com/2019/08/19/the-prince-and-the-figurehead/"">misinterpretation via unconscious motivated reasoning</a> and then just not bother to scrupulously check whether the interpretation was true? And how could Alexander know?</p>
<p>Given my current beliefs about the psychology of deception, I find myself inclined to reach for words like ""motivated"", ""misleading"", ""distorted"", <em>&amp;c.</em>, and am more likely to frown at uses of ""lie"", ""fraud"", ""scam"", <em>&amp;c.</em> where intent is hard to establish. But even while frowning internally, I want to avoid <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/bwkZD6uskCQBJDCeC/self-consciousness-wants-to-make-everything-about-itself#Tone_arguments"">tone-policing</a> people whose word-choice procedures are calibrated differently from mine when I think I understand the structure-in-the-world they're trying to point to. Insisting on replacing the six instances of the phrase ""malicious lies"" in ""Niceness, Community, and Civilization"" with ""maliciously-motivated false belief"" would just be <em>worse writing</em>.</p>
<p>And I <em>definitely</em> don't want to excuse motivated reasoning as a mere ordinary human failing for which someone can't be blamed! One of the key features that distinguishes motivated reasoning from simple mistakes is the way that the former <em>responds to incentives</em> (such as being blamed). If the <a href=""http://elephantinthebrain.com/"">elephant in your brain</a> thinks it can <em>get away with lying</em> just by keeping conscious-you in the dark, it should think again!</p>

It was a warm day and those two were wearing white himatia without chitons underneath, as was usual for poorer people. Both left the right shoulder bare, with the fabric rising diagonally to the left shoulder where a pin held it in place, yet Archimedes noticed that in the way they had positioned themselves right next to each other the upper part of the child&#x2019;s clothes was reaching exactly to the height of the lower part of the youth&#x2019;s next to him. This formed an elegant, straight line, starting at the lower edge of the first cloth and ending to the upper edge of the other, and from a distance one would get the impression that it was all one continuous material instead of two distinct himatia. &#xA0;</p><p>Despite his surprise, he immediately became aware that while he could notice the effect due to standing opposite those two, their position naturally rendered it impossible for them to witness and enjoy this harmonious sight. &#xA0;</p><p>That they remained there, immobile, because they were indeed aware of the effect and meant for anyone coming near to observe it, was readily obvious; yet Archimedes couldn&#x2019;t refrain from walking closer and asking just why they went into so much trouble so as to produce something they themselves weren&#x2019;t allowed to observe, given that if they&#x2019;d even attempt to steal a glance at it the delicate balance instantly would be ruined and therefore nothing would remain to be seen...</p><p>The youth kept silent, but the child, being more impulsive, replied that Archimedes was wrong. It wasn&#x2019;t at all true that they stood there in this manner out of an intention to present to others the form he saw. To be precise, they were fully oblivious that anyone would be seeing such a thing when coming from afar. They were standing so close to each other out of mere habit. Lastly, they weren&#x2019;t moving at all because they had been waiting there for their father to return from the beach. &#xA0;</p><p>It is said that then, as he was walking away, he thought that it isn&#x2019;t as much that nature seamlessly presents us with mathematical symmetries, but that the overall number of elements which, unbeknownst to us, are woven together into any image is so vast that a small number of our own interests is always also contained within it. &#xA0;</p><p>Text was first published at <a href=""https://www.patreon.com/Kyriakos"">https://www.patreon.com/Kyriakos</a></p>",KyriakosCH,kyriakosch,KyriakosCH,

Massachusetts has an interesting law for grocery stores to make sure
price scanners are configured correctly: if your item rings up for
more than the price on the shelf you get one for free (or $10 off it's
it's more than $10).  Specifically:



</p><p>

</p>

<blockquote>
if there is a discrepancy between the advertised price, the sticker
price, the scanner price or the display price and the checkout price
on any grocery item, a food store or a food department shall charge a
consumer the lowest price. If the checkout price or scanner price is
not the lowest price or does not reflect any qualifying discount, the
seller:
<ul>
<li><p>shall not charge the consumer for 1 unit of the grocery
item, if the lowest price is $10 or less;</p></li>
<li><p>shall charge the consumer the lowest price less $10 for 1 unit of
the grocery item, if the lowest price is more than $10</p></li>
</ul>
  — <a href=""https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleXV/Chapter94/Section184C"">MGL
I.XV.94.184.C</a>
</blockquote>



<p>

The grocery store is required to put a sign at each register
describing the law, which means that when you notice this you can
point to the sign.  Which is way better than trying to show the
cashier the relevant text of the law on your phone would be.

</p>

<p>

I have fun trying to remember the price I see for each item as I put
it into my cart so if it rings up at a different price I can point
that out.  The law has an exception for cases where the price is a
""gross error"" (off by half) but in most cases discrepancies are small:
ringing up at $4.99 when it said $4.50 on the shelf.  Because you get
the item for free if they've overcharged you, however, what matters is
just that they put a misleadingly low price on the shelf.

</p>

<p>

I've noticed stores rarely have a good system in place for fixing
these problems.  When I catch one they generally check and give me the
item for free, but that doesn't usually translate into fixing the
price on the shelf.  Which means that when I come in next time, it's
often still wrong.

</p>

<p>

This seems like something that a group of shoppers could use together.
Whenever anyone noticed a mispricing they could post to a mailing list
(""the store brand blueberries are marked $3.99 but ring up as $4.29""),
and then everyone on the list could go get some free blueberries.
This would probably get stores to be faster about updating their
prices.

</p>

<p>

Even if the stores got very fast at fixing things, though, it could
still be rough for them.  Say one person goes through and notices
they've been overcharged for something.  They don't say anything to
the store, but instead write to the list and name a time.  At the
designated time a group of shoppers pick up one unit each and fan out
over the store's checkout lines.  The items are all scanned, the
shoppers all object, and the store has to give away one item per
checkout line instead of just one item total.  This could be a parody
heist plotline in a sitcom.

</p>

<p>

(While this is hard to fix with technical means, if people started
doing it, of course, they would update the law.)

Perhaps it can be proven consistent by using Proof System Y? Do we just end up making an infinite chain of appeals up along a tower of proof systems?

Epistemic Status: I don&apos;t know what I am missing, and I am filled with doubt and uncertainty.]</p><p>If the notion of professional forecasters disturbs you in your sleep, and you toss and turn worrying about the blight of experts brooding upon the world, perhaps the golden light of distributed information systems have peaked out from beyond these darkest visions, and you have hope for the wisdom of crowds.</p><p>Prediction markets aggregate information by incentivizing predictors to place bets on the outcomes of well-defined questions. Since information can be both niche and useful, prediction markets also incentivize the development of specialized expertise that is then incorporated into the general pool of information in the form of a bet. When this works, it works very well.</p><p>When information is not widely distributed or discoverable, prediction markets are not useful. Prediction markets for WMDs, Pope Francis&#x2019; next pronouncement, or which celebrity couple will choose to live in a van probably will not work. Or consider a public prediction market about what percent of the current freshman class at California public universities will make it to graduation. Such a market would be pretty distorted if all the registrars and admissions councillors were betting as well.</p><p>Prediction markets do have some wicked clever uses too. For example, a prediction market can also act as a proxy for some other event. That is to say, that through some ingenious design one can correlate a prediction market&#x2019;s assessment of an event to another measurable outcome. Here is one instance in which researchers used a prediction market about the probability of war in Iraq, correlated it to the price of oil, and estimated the effect of war on oil prices. This provided the very useful information telling us what % of the price of oil is caused by the threat of war in Iraq. At an even broader level, this prediction market design allows us to study the effects of war on economies.</p><p>On the other hand, an additional limitation to prediction markets is that people have to be interested enough to take part in them, which is a real bummer. Intelligent quantitative people might enjoy researching to gain some betting leverage in prediction markets qua prediction markets. But even then, most people want to research questions that they themselves find interesting [citation needed]. So even the best designed prediction market can fail without enough parties incentivized to care.</p><p>The greatest limitation for prediction markets however is not any of the above technical problems. We are optimistic that these can be overcome. But there is a logical problem which can&#x2019;t. Since each specialized piece of information is converted into a bet, the market will react to that new information without having to know the particulars of that information. This is the beautiful wonder of markets - everything is turned into a utility function. However, for boards, administrators, and governments which want to take action based upon the information from a prediction market two bits of important information are left totally inaccessible. First, what information was the most salient for bringing the market odds where they currently are? Secondly, what aspect of the current state of affairs is the most leverageable? That is, of all the hidden factors which caused the market consensus to reach this point, which, if any of them, do we have any power to affect? If the point is to not just know what the market says, but to know how the world works, then prediction markets in themselves may not be of much help. Here are two quick examples to demonstrate illustrate the point:</p><p>You work at the North Pole managing present-procurement for heads of state (PP-HOS, for short). Each year you scramble to get enough coal for the various heads of state because you don&#x2019;t know until Christmas week whether they are on the naughty or nice list. This is an important question because heads of state receive coal proportional to their standing in society, and since the cost of coal rises in winter, it costs your department quite a bit of money to expedite all these coal orders. So this year you have created a prediction market to tell you the chances of the president of Hungary getting coal again this year and you plan on acting on the market&#x2019;s prediction in September, well ahead of the November coal rush&#x2026;. The market is a success! Your department saves some money, and you save just about the right amount of coal for the beloved president of Hungary. But when the big man pulls the plug on funding the market apparatus, you realize that despite all the little helpers that made the market a success, you didn&#x2019;t gain any wisdom about how to predict whether a head of state will get coal this year from it. That is an example of a market working without conveying any insights. Thus markets keep inscrutable the inner workings of Father Christmas&#x2019; naughty list.</p><p>The second example demonstrates the leverage problem of a market. You are the principal of a school. You get drunk one night and rent out a Vegas casino which you revamp into a test score betting complex. You want to know how your students will do on this week&#x2019;s standardized test. So you make all their information available to patrons who then place bets on each student. Despite the drugs, sex, and alcohol in this administrative Bacchanal, the market works astoundingly well, and the predicted individual performance on the standardized tests matches the actual performance near perfectly. However, in the sober light of late afternoon, you realize that your market solution for predicting scores didn&#x2019;t reveal much about what you should be doing differently. In fact, the post-mortem indicates that the 3 biggest predictors of test scores are not things even remotely under your control. You despair believing that there is nothing you can do to help students improve. Even if there were a fourth cause of test success which is under your control, it doesn&#x2019;t matter and will not be discernible among the thousands of bets made, because it, like everything else was flattened into the same utility function.</p>",JohnBuridan,johnburidan,SebastianG ,

power</a> 

<a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/10/us/california-power-outage.html"">is
a serious problem</a>, especially for people with medical dependencies
on electricity.  Examples they give include people who:



</p><p>

</p>

<ul>

<li><p>Have severe sleep apnea, and can't safely sleep without a CPAP.</p></li>

<li><p>Sleep on a mattress that needs continous electricity to
prevent it from deflating.</p></li>

<li><p>Need to keep their insulin refrigerated.</p></li>

<li><p>Use a medicine delivery system that requires electricity every
four hours to operate.</p></li>

</ul>



<p>

This outage was dangerous for them and others, but it also seems like
a big problem that they're in a position where they need absolutely
reliable grid power.  Even without politically motivated outages, the
grid isn't built to a standard of complete reliabilty.

</p>

<p>

There's an awkward valley between ""reasonably reliable, but with a major
outage every few years in a storm or something"" and ""completely
reliable, and you can trust your life on it"" where the system is
reliable enough that we stop thinking of it as something that
might go away but it's not so reliable that we should.

</p>

<p>

We can't get California out of this valley by investing to the point
that there won't be outages; earthquakes, if nothing else, ensure
that.  So instead we should plan for outages, and make outages
frequent enough that this planning will actually happen.
Specifically:

</p>

<ul>

<li><p>Insurance should cover backup power supplies for medical
equipment, and they should be issued by default.</p></li>

<li><p>When there hasn't been an outage in ~1y, there should be a test
outage to uncover unknown dependencies.</p></li>

</ul>

While this outage was probably not done for good reasons, the problems
it has uncovered are ones we need to fix.",jkaufman,jkaufman,jefftk,

In 1562, the Catholics found a giant list of arguments <em>against everything</em> by the minor Greek skeptic <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sextus-empiricus/"">Sextus Empiricus</a>, got very excited, and immediately <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/History-Scepticism-Savonarola-Bayle/dp/0195107683"">weaponized</a> them to show that the Protestant arguments fail (because all arguments fail).</p><p>5. These soon spread and became a sensation, and not just for being a useful superweapon. Plenty of intellectuals were earnest humanists used to taking arguments at face value, and found Sextus&apos; arguments genuinely upsetting and fascinating.</p><br><p>I trace continental thinkers&apos; &quot;everything is subjective/relative&quot; arguments back to a single 1710 error in <a href=""https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/A_Treatise_Concerning_the_Principles_of_Human_Knowledge"">George Berkeley</a>:</p><blockquote>[...] I am content to put the whole upon this Issue; if you can but conceive it possible for one extended moveable Substance, or in general, for any one Idea or any thing like an Idea, to exist otherwise than in a Mind perceiving it, I shall readily give up the Cause[....]</blockquote><blockquote>But say you, surely there is nothing easier than to imagine Trees, for instance, in a Park, or Books existing in a Closet, and no Body by to perceive them. I answer, you may so, there is no difficulty in it: But what is all this, I beseech you, more than framing in your Mind certain Ideas which you call Books and Trees, and the same time omitting to frame the Idea of any one that may perceive them? But do not you your self perceive or think of them all the while? This therefore is nothing to the purpose: It only shews you have the Power of imagining or forming Ideas in your Mind; but it doth not shew that you can conceive it possible, the Objects of your Thought may exist without the Mind: To make out this, it is necessary that you conceive them existing unconceived or unthought of, which is a manifest Repugnancy.</blockquote><p>If I can imagine a tree that exists outside of any mind, then I can imagine a tree that is not being imagined. But &quot;an imagined X that is not being imagined&quot; is a contradiction. Therefore everything I can imagine or conceive of must be a mental object.</p><p>Berkeley ran with this argument to claim that there could be no unexperienced objects, therefore everything must exist in some mind &#x2014; if nothing else, the mind of God.</p><p>The error here is mixing up what falls inside vs. outside of quotation marks. &quot;I&apos;m conceiving of a not-conceivable object&quot; is a formal contradiction, but &quot;I&apos;m conceiving of the concept &apos;a not-conceivable object&apos;&quot; isn&apos;t, and human brains and natural language make it easy to mix up levels like those.</p><p>(I can immediately think of another major milestone in the history of European thought, Anselm&apos;s ontological argument for God, that shows the same brain bug.)</p><p>Berkeley&apos;s view was able to find fertile soil in an environment rife with non-naturalism, skeptical arguments, and competition between epistemic criteria and authorities. Via Kant and Kant&apos;s successors (Hegel chief among them), he successfully convinced the main current of 19th-century European philosophy to treat the idea of a &quot;mind-independent world&quot; as something ineffable or mysterious, and to treat experiences or perspectives as fundamental.</p><p>(<strong>Edit: </strong>G.E. Moore <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/DSTuA9ohakD6k3drh/a-simple-sketch-of-how-realism-became-unpopular#yKvLqGoCmwExQXfS2"">seems to think</a> that everyone in the 19th century was making an error along these lines, but I <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/DSTuA9ohakD6k3drh/a-simple-sketch-of-how-realism-became-unpopular#ixbYXGM9yxYfqN9qM"">now suspect</a> Kant himself wasn&apos;t making this mistake; I think his main error was trying too hard to defeat skepticism.</p><p>I also don&apos;t think Berkeley&apos;s writing would have been sufficient to confuse Europe on its own; it&apos;s too lucid and well-articulated. The transition to Kantian and Hegelian versions of these arguments is important because they were much more elaborate and poorly expressed, requiring a lot of intellectual effort in order to spot the inconsistencies.)</p><p>My unscholarly surface impression of the turn of the 20th century is that these memes (&quot;the territory is fundamentally mysterious&quot; and &quot;maps are sort of magical and cosmically important&quot;) allowed a lot of mysticism and weird metaphysics to creep into intellectual life, but that ideas like those are <em>actually</em> hard to justify in dry academic prose, such that the more memetically fit descendants of idealism in the 20th century ended up being quietist (&quot;let&apos;s just run experiments and not talk about all this weird &apos;world&apos; stuff&quot;) or instrumentalist / phenomenalist / skeptic / relativist (&quot;you can&apos;t know &apos;world&apos; stuff, so let&apos;s retreat to just discussing impressions; and maybe you can&apos;t even know those, so really what&apos;s left is power struggles&quot;).</p><p>Today, the pendulum has long since swung back again in most areas of intellectual life, perhaps because we&apos;ve more solidly settled around our new central authority (science) and the threats to centralized epistemic authority (religious and philosophical controversy) are more distant memories.

And how are we going to do it?</p><p>In many situations, answering these questions might not seem difficult. We may already have a mission statement or set of values that guides all of our actions, addressing the first question. Likewise, we may already have a plan of action in place, a set of activities that seems to match the goals we&#x2019;ve set out. Problem, meet solution. Done and done.</p><p>As intuitive as it is to imagine the beginning and the end of that process, though, all too often the devil is in the details&#x2014;or more  specifically in this case, all of the pesky steps in between. Figuring out what those ought to be takes real work, and is generally not something that can be done in one&#x2019;s head. And because it takes work, a  lot of times we don&#x2019;t bother to do it.</p><p>Fortunately, there is a tool called <strong>theory of change </strong>that provides a means of figuring out all the steps. A theory of change is a visual depiction of your strategy. You probably already have a notion  in your head of what your strategy is, but a theory of change gives you a means of articulating that strategy in a form of a diagram.</p><p>Why would you want to do this? Making your theory of change explicit accomplishes several things:</p><ul><li>Developing a theory of change is a great way to <strong>get big questions about program or organizational strategy out in the open</strong>. In some cases, these questions might not have ever been considered before, or they&#x2019;ve been thought about but never discussed among the team.</li><li>A finished theory of change diagram is a <strong>useful shorthand for explaining the mechanics of how a program works</strong> to someone who&#x2019;s not that familiar with it. It&#x2019;s not a marketing document, but it is a communication tool for people who want to understand your strategy in depth.</li><li>Theories of change are great for helping you <strong>decide what to measure</strong>. What information is most important for your program or organization to  have? Are there any assumptions underlying your success that seem especially vulnerable or uncertain? Does the theory of change show that certain objectives have to be met before any others are possible? If so, you might want to focus measurement or tracking efforts on those objectives or assumptions.</li><li><strong>Walking through a theory of change with new staff members</strong> can be a great way to get them up to speed quickly on the &#x201C;big picture,&#x201D; and not just the details that they need to focus on day to day. A theory of change in this context can be particularly effective at showing staff how their work fits into a larger plan.</li><li>Many funders are accustomed to working with theories of change and logic models, and <strong>including a theory of change with a grant proposal</strong> can communicate that you speak their language and have thought seriously about how a program works.</li></ul><p>Nearly all theories of change contain the following fundamental elements. In combination, they describe a linear, causal pathway between programs or policy interventions and an aspirational end-state.</p><ul><li><strong>Activities </strong>are actions or strategies undertaken by the organization that is the subject of the theory of change. These activities usually take place in the context of ongoing programs, although they can also be one-time projects, special initiatives, or policies such as legislation or regulations.</li><li><strong>Outcomes </strong>are the desired short-, medium-, or long-term results of successful program or policy implementation.</li><li><strong>Impacts (or Goals) </strong>represent the highest purpose of the program, initiative, or organization that is the subject of the theory of change.</li></ul><p>To illustrate this, we can look at a simple example. Let&#x2019;s say you&#x2019;ve decided you want to go to law school, and in order to get into law school you have to get a good score on the LSAT. So, how can you make sure you get a good score? Intuitively, you decide that taking a test prep class is the way to go. It sounds simple enough, but it&#x2019;s  worth thinking through the assumption that taking the test prep class would actually improve your score. Why do we think that might happen? Well, one factor could certainly be that you get more familiarity with the test and the types of questions asked. Perhaps there is another,  more psychological factor at work too. If you&#x2019;re someone who gets nervous taking tests, the practice exams and deep engagement with the material that comes with a class could help you to get more comfortable with the idea of the LSAT and make it seem less intimidating, thus improving performance.</p><p>Sure enough, this line of thinking lends itself quite easily to a theory of change:</p><span><figure><img src=""https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D12AQFBDugipWYCDA/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0?e=1576108800&amp;v=beta&amp;t=q-5fJHcQCog6FRxIRxSoGvhc-LD8CM4JulUDz1K6s_4"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:100%""></figure></span><p>Of course, most real-life programs and initiatives are quite a bit more complex than this simple example, which is why it&apos;s important to take the time to get the details outside of your head and onto the page or screen. Here&apos;s a theory of change I helped develop for the <a href=""https://www.hewlett.org/programs/performing-arts/"">William and Flora Hewlett Foundation&apos;s Performing Arts Program</a>,  which distributes about $20 million a year to organizations in the San Francisco Bay Area region. This was the first theory of change the program ever had, and it was used to guide grantmaking between 2009 and 2011. (Don&apos;t be confused by the labels; in this case, &quot;Ultimate  Outcomes&quot; = &quot;Impacts,&quot; and &quot;Cluster&quot; and &quot;Component&quot; outcomes just mean early-stage and late-stage respectively.)</p><span><figure><img src=""https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D12AQF7w-UYwH6mzQ/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0?e=1576108800&amp;v=beta&amp;t=Ypn6w3eavQXw3uTBdy91_5H85x2KFQJtos-MWaXzo8w"" class=""draft-image "" style=""width:100%""></figure></span><p>The truth is that <em>any </em>decision you make, if it has any  element of intentionality, can be diagrammed as a theory of change. Everything from taking an umbrella with you in case it rains to making time for your favorite TV show has a theory of change behind it. Even if the idea of formalizing your decision-making in this way feels utterly unnatural, I can assure you that if you think strategically at all, then you have a theory of change in your head already. What I can&#x2019;t tell you is whether it&#x2019;s a <em>good </em>theory of change&#x2014;that&#x2019;s something that you probably won&#x2019;t be able to figure out until you take the time to write it down and get feedback on it.</p><p>Theory of change <a href=""https://www.theoryofchange.org/what-is-theory-of-change/toc-background/toc-origins/"">was developed originally as an evaluation methodology</a>. But I&#x2019;ve come to believe it&#x2019;s much more powerful when deployed as a design tool for strategy. I&#x2019;ve worked with many different strategy frameworks over the years, and most of them are essentially the same set of tools in different packaging. For me, what sets theory of  change apart is its insistence that we name the assumptions of cause and effect behind our work. It can&#x2019;t tell you what your goals should be, but if you already know where you want to end up, I don&#x2019;t know of another tool that prompts anywhere near the same level of critical  thinking about how you&#x2019;re going to get there.</p>",Ian David Moss,ian-david-moss,Ian David Moss,

Here's part of a comment I got on my 

<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/realigning-housing-coalitions"">housing coalitions post</a>:



<blockquote> I consider it extremely unlikely you have found renters
with the expectation of rent going down. Assuming they want to live in
a well maintained building, I consider unlikely they even desire it,
once they think about it. What renters hope for in general is
increases that are less than their increases in income. Landlords
mostly do expect that rents will go up, but the magnitude of their
expectations matters, many have the same expectations as renters for
moderate increases. Others will have short term/transactional thinking
and will want to charge what the market will bear.
</blockquote>



</p><p>

This seems worth being explicit about: when I talk about how I think
rents should be lower, I really mean lower.  I'm not trying to say
that it's ok if rent keeps rising as long as incomes rise faster, but
that rents should go down.

<i>These are on the same scale, though not adjusted for inflation (13%
from 2011-06 to 2019-06).</i>

</p>

<p>


In 2011 a two-bedroom apartment in my part of Somerville would have
gone for $1800/month, or $2050/month in 2019 dollars.  In 2019, it
would be $3000/month.  Compared to 13% inflation we have 67% higher
rents.

</p>

<p>

Another way to look at this is that for what you would pay now for an
apartment a ten-minute walk from Davis would, in 2011, have covered an
apartment a ten-minute walk from Park St.  And what you would have
been paying for a Harvard Sq apartment in 2011 wouldn't get you an
East Arlington apartment today.

</p>

<p>

These large increases have been a windfall for landlords.
Property taxes haven't risen much, upkeep is similar, but because
demand has grown so much without supply being permitted to rise to
meet it the market rent is much higher.  If we build enough new
housing that rents fall to 2011 levels, landlords will make less money
than they had been hoping, but they'll still be able to afford to
keep up their properties.

</p>

<p>

I'll support pretty much any project that builds more bedrooms: market
rate, affordable, public, transitional.  Rents are so high that all of
these would still be worth building and maintaining even if everyone
could see were were building enough housing that rents would fall next
year to 2011 levels.

</p>

<p>

As a homeowner and a landlord, I know that this means I would get less
in rent and I'm ok with that.  I value a healthy community that people
can afford to live in far more than a market that pays me a lot of
money for being lucky enough to have bought a two-family at a good
time.

The members of the set—dog, cat, and shoe—are called the <em>elements</em> of the set.</p><p>A subtle but important aspect of a set is that the imaginary bag has to be defined by a <em>rule</em>. This rule can be pretty much anything, like ""put into a bag everything I'm pointing at,"" but it does have to be a rule. Typically, sets can fit pretty much anything in, and so you can often just say ""here is my set"" rather than having to be explicit about the rule. We'll get back to why the rule matters at the end.

First of all, let's just talk about the ""maps"" part of that. Think of sets as countries, and the elements of the sets as cities in that country.

That would just be saying that two states of the world end up at the same point, which certain seems like a scientific possibility.</p><p>Now we're going to address sets and functions from a category theoretic perspective.

We do this by saying that sets are objects. Seriously, it's that simple—objects don't really have any properties at all aside from their morphisms, so there's nothing more to this step. </p><p>The next step is to make our functions into morphisms. We do this by saying that functions are morphisms, <em>and then we check that functions obey the rules of morphisms in a category</em>.</p><p>First, domain and codomain. Sets serve as the domain and codomain of functions, and since sets are our objects, the functions will clearly have the objects of this category as their domain and codomain.</p><p>So the first real thing to figure out is composition.

So every set has an identity function. (And only one, at that—there's only one way to pair up each element with itself.)</p><p>And now we're done. We've just shown how sets and functions can be considered a category: sets are objects by declaration, and we can show that functions between sets compose associatively, and an identity function can be defined for every set.</p><p>Neat!</p><p>You might be wondering if we could have defined a category with sets as objects and <em>binary relations </em>as morphisms. Indeed we can, in pretty much the same way as we did with sets and functions. In fact, since functions are just particular types of binary relations, proving that binary relations meet the rules of a category in general would have proved it for the specific case as well. In fact, the category of sets and functions is a subcategory of the category of sets and binary relations.</p><p>Yet it is the case that the category of sets and functions gets the significant name <strong>Set</strong>, whereas the category of sets and binary relations gets the much less interesting name <strong>Rel</strong>. That's because it is the category-theoretic perspective that everything that's interesting about a category is contained in its <em>morphisms</em>. Functions are basically the most important morphism in mathematics, so we give the category for which functions are morphisms the name <strong>Set</strong>—we care about sets because, more than anything, they let us define functions.</p><p>***</p><p>One last note on defining the category of sets, <strong>Set</strong>. You may have heard of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_paradox"">Russell's paradox</a>, which says you can't have the set of all sets. That's because sets have to be defined according to a rule, as we said in the beginning. What if you try to define a set of all sets that are not elements of themselves? Then one possibility is that this set is either an element of itself, in which case it <em>is</em> included, in which case we have violated the rule just laid down. But the only other possibility is that it is not an element of itself, in which case it should be an element of itself according to its rule. But we just saw why we can't let it be an element of itself. So we bounce back and forth in eternal paradox.</p><p>So we can't have a set of all sets. Then how can we have a <em>category</em> of all sets? We'll discuss that in the next post, which will address this issue and use our new understanding of sets to more properly formalize the definition of a category given a couple of posts ago.</p><p>Additionally, we'll look at two other interesting things about sets. We'll see how, although sets are bags of black dots, we can use functions to give those black dots meaning. It's the category-theoretic view that everything you want to know about an object is found in the object's morphisms. Furthermore, we'll also see that there's two special kinds of sets which can be though of as the ""minimal"" and ""maximal"" set, respectively. In doing so, we'll get our first tastes of the two main goals of this series, the <em>Yoneda lemma</em> and <em>adjoint functors</em>.</p><p>***</p><p>Incidentally, writing these posts has been shockingly exhausting and time-absorbing. So after this next post, I don't expect anything further on the weekend, although I may try to answer comments then. Five posts a week is not sustainable. 2-3 a week is probably more reasonable. This experience has given me a lot of respect for people who keep up daily blogs or write books. Thanks very much to people reading and commenting on these so far. It's very useful to have feedback and gratifying to know that people are interested in category theory.</p><p>I am going to work as well on lowering the cost to myself of creating drawings to aid explanations. I have always explained this material in the past with easy access to pen and paper, and somehow it never quite occurred to me that even sketching out a few dots and arrows is much more of a pain on a computer. Taking recommendations, if you have any.</p>",countedblessings,countedblessings,countedblessings,

That post focused on bigger things. But there were a lot of smaller, more miscellaneous things that I've learned too. Those are the things that I want to talk about in this post.</p><h1>People think of a mobile app when you say you're building an ""app""</h1><p>Even when I clarify and try to explain that it's a <em>web</em> app, most people are still confused. So sometimes I call it a website, which I hate because that sort of implies that it's static. Sometimes I describe it as poker software. I still haven't found a good solution to this. I think ""website"" is probably best.</p><h1><a href=""https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Ghosting"">Ghosting</a> is normal</h1><p>This is a huge pet peeve of mine. I hate it. But apparently it's just a thing that many people do. At least in the business world. Let me give you some examples.</p><p>1) I reached out to this vlogger on Twitter. I asked if she'd be interested in working with me. She said she is. Then she proposed that I pay her as an advertiser to promote the app. I said in response that I'm only looking for revenue share partnerships right now, <em>and asked if she's interested in that</em>. No response. I follow up in a few days. No response. Follow up again. No response.</p><p>2) There was a guy who I would study poker with via Skype every week. I swear, we had a good relationship, and had productive study sessions. At some point he was going to be away for some trip for a few weeks, so we said we'd resume when he gets back. After the trip I reach out to set up a time for our next session. No response. I reach out again. No response. Again. No response. I eventually start spacing it out over months, but I never get a response from him. Eventually he signs up as my second paid user. I email him to thank him and ask if he wants to catch up. No response. At this point maybe he just feels too awkward to respond. I'm really confused though. I have no clue what happened.</p><p>3) There've been a few times where I'd try to set up lunches with people for advice. Many times the conversation would go:</p><blockquote>Me: Want to get lunch?</blockquote><blockquote>Them: Sure, how about next week. </blockquote><blockquote>Me: Sounds good, what would be a good time for you? </blockquote><blockquote>Them: <em>Silence.</em> </blockquote><blockquote>Me: Just checking in for lunch next week.</blockquote><blockquote>Them: <em>Silence</em>.</blockquote><blockquote>Me: Still want to get lunch? </blockquote><blockquote>Them: <em>Silence</em>.</blockquote><blockquote>Me: Sorry we missed each other last week. Want to reschedule?</blockquote><blockquote>Them: <em>Silence</em>.</blockquote><blockquote>Them: Hey, sorry I didn't respond previously. How's this upcoming week for you?</blockquote><blockquote>Me: No worries. I'm free. How about Wednesday?</blockquote><blockquote>Them: <em>Silence.</em></blockquote><p>I could go on and on giving examples of this sort of stuff, but I think you get the idea.</p><p>Additionally, I've found that when people want something from <em>you</em>, this phenomena completely disappears! Mysterious, huh? </p><h1>Book authors are just people</h1><p>In the beginning I'd get star struck when I met or talked with book authors, or similarly ""famous"" people. But now I just see them as people. People aren't banging down their door. You can email them. It's not implausible that they'll get coffee with you.</p><h1>There's no such thing as ""just throwing out a number""</h1><p>""Suppose we said it'd be $100/month.""</p><p>""Suppose we say it's 50% revenue share.""</p><p>I've made statements like this, intending for it to not mean anything and just be, y'know, <em>throwing out a number</em>. But in my experience, people get attached to these numbers. Or at least they become heavily anchored to them.</p><h1>A few kind words means the world to an early stage entrepreneur</h1><p>Sometimes I'd get emails from people saying that they really like the app and that they're thankful that I created it. That stuff really meant so much to me, and made me so happy. I almost want to create some sort of effective altruist movement of doing things like that, given the amount of utility it produces.</p><h1>Paying for people's meals doesn't seem to induce much reciprocation</h1><p>A lot of times I meet with people and will pay for their meals, in hopes that they'll reciprocate and spend more effort trying to help me out. But I've found it to be incredibly ineffective.</p><p>Here's an extreme example. There was a point where I was pushing hard for people to sit with me and allow me to do user research with them. I would offer to buy someone lunch if they would do so. I posted this on Reddit, and one guy took me up on it. So we met for lunch when he was in town.</p><p>He ended up bringing along two friends. They were both only vaguely interested in poker. Not good.</p><p>During the lunch, the table was a bit too crowded to take out laptops and do the user research. That's another thing I've learned — don't plan on doing things that involve a computer over lunch. So anyway, we have lunch, we realize that the user research part isn't working out because there's not enough room, so we say we'll do it after we finish lunch. Then one guy says that they're actually super tired from being up all night last night, and maybe we could do the user research tomorrow, or via Skype when they get back home if tomorrow doesn't work out. I say sure.</p><p>I pay the bill for all four of us. It must have been about $80.</p><p>They're busy the next day. Afterwards, I text him/them a few times trying to set up a time to do the user research. Not responsive. Sometimes they straight up ignore me.</p><p>Later on when I launched, I emailed them. No response.</p><p>You'd expect a little bit more from a group who you treated to an $80 lunch. Maybe these guys were the exception, but I get the sense that they're more the norm.</p><p>Cialdini — are you part of the replication crisis now too?</p><h1>ROI isn't enough, even for high stakes pros</h1><p>I talked previously about how poker software is easily a +ROI investment, and how I've been surprised at how unwilling people are to see it that way. But I was <em>particularly</em> struck by the fact that high stakes poker pros wouldn't see it that way. I would have thought that such people would be logical enough to jump on +ROI opportunities.</p><p>Example: I was having a conversation with Cy where he was saying that $100/month is pretty expensive, and I said I don't think it is at all. Consider some quick math. Say a high stakes poker player plays 10,000 hands/month, and the software improves your winrate by 0.1bb/100 hands. That's 1bb/1,000 hands, 10bb/10,000 hands, or 10bb/month. If you're playing $25/50, which him and Brad play, that's $500/month. And those are pretty conservative assumptions. The software could easily improve your winrate by more than that. And online poker pros often play way more than 10,000 hands/month. But this logic did not change his perspective. He said that he just doesn't see it this way, and that he knows his other high stakes friends don't either.</p><h1>I deleted my backlog, and it turns out nothing terrible happened</h1><p>I was inspired to delete my backlog by <a href=""https://justinjackson.ca/nobacklogs"">Jason Fried wants to delete my backlog</a>. It's worked out pretty well for me! It alleviated some stress, and I didn't feel like I was missing something.</p><h1>Getting people to do user research with is hard</h1><p>I figured it wouldn't be that hard.</p><p>""Hey, let me sit down with you over lunch and watch you use my app. I'll pick up the bill!""</p><p>""Hey, let's Skype and let me watch you use my app. I'll coach you for free!""</p><p>I would think that stuff like this would easily get me dozens and dozens of volunteers pretty quickly, but it didn't work out like that for me. I found it hard to find people to do user research with.</p><h1>E2E testing wasn't worth it for me</h1><p>I've had a very love-hate relationship with e2e testing. It's so awesome when you have all your tests and can run them to make sure things work. But I really hate the framework I'm using, Nightwatch.js. It's slow and cumbersome. Maintaining the tests proved to be <em>really</em> time consuming. There were so many weird bugs. I ultimately just decided to stop maintaining and writing e2e tests, because I didn't feel that they were worth it, given how time consuming they were.</p><h1>Long inferential distances is the realest thing in the world</h1><p>One example is that I was talking to a <em>professional poker player and coach</em>. He didn't know how to read a 2d graph with x-y coordinates. I said ""x-axis"". He said, ""what?"".</p><p>This made me decide to change the text on my app to say ""horizontal axis"" instead of ""x-axis"".</p><p>He also struggled to understand that a point on the graph refers to a pair of data points. And to understand what the slope means. And how to calculate expected value.</p><p>He wasn't the only one. I have plenty of other examples of stuff like this.</p><p>I don't want to come across as being mean though. Just sayin'. I certainly have my own share of incompetencies.</p><h1>I often felt a strong urge to get out of the house</h1><p>Furthermore, for some reason, I felt an urge to get <em>far</em> <em>away. </em>There's this coffee shop I like to go to that is about an hour long bike ride away. I found myself wanting to go there a lot. This urge confused me, because the coffee shop isn't that great. Eventually I realized that I really liked the bike ride, and being far away from home. Maybe because it acted as a divider between ""work day"" and ""relaxing time"".</p><h1>Other stuff</h1><p>There are definitely things that I'm forgetting. Hopefully I'll add to this post as I remember them.</p>",adamzerner,adamzerner,Adam Zerner,

Now I think it would be a good time to reflect on my experiences and see if I could learn something from them.</p><h1>Market size</h1><p>As I talked about in the <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/QczDDjzveeYar85mS/reflections-on-premium-poker-tools-part-2-deciding-to-call"">previous post</a>, initially, I thought that the market size was hundreds of thousands of users, and that I could make something like $100/user. After talking to people in the industry, I now believe that the market is more like 5-10k users, and not all of them are willing to pay $100.</p><p>This is incredibly important! Going after a $20M market is very different from going after a $200k one. If I knew it was the latter in the beginning, I wouldn't have pursued this as a business. Spending 2+ years for the chance at making maybe $200k just isn't worth it, given the inherent uncertainty with startups, and the alternatives of pursuing a startup with a higher upside, or getting a job that pays approximately that much but does so with 100% certainty.</p><p>So what happened? Where did I go wrong? Let's see. This was (roughly) my initial logic:</p><blockquote>100k subscribers to the poker subreddit. Educational YouTube videos gets 100k+ views. Popular posts on TwoPlusTwo (big poker forum) have 1M+ views over the years.</blockquote><blockquote>The kind of person to subscribe to the poker subreddit, watch an educational YouTube video, or spend their time on TwoPlusTwo is probably somewhat serious about poker. They're trying to get better at the game. All of this is indicative of a market size of hundreds of thousands of users. Possibly more. And poker is expanding. So there seems to be a big market here.</blockquote><blockquote>And poker players are probably pretty willing to spend money. Investing in software is +ROI. Poker players love ROI! And they tend to be on the wealthy side.</blockquote><p>Maybe I really underestimated the divide between passive + free and active + paid. Watching a YouTube video is something that is passive. You sit there and consume information. Using poker software is something that is active. You have to sit and think and mess around with numbers. Watching a YouTube video is free. Poker software costs money.</p><p>But then what about the existence of poker books? There around 500 poker books on the market. The top ones get up to 100k sales, and many others get in the tens of thousands, I think. Maybe it's that with books, someone is telling you what the right answers are, but with software, you have to figure out the right answers yourself.</p><p>Anyway, I think the bigger point is that I should have found people in the industry and asked them about the market size. I started doing that towards the end of my journey, but I should have done so from the beginning. People in the poker world all seem to have a pretty solid idea of what the market is really like. Why screw around trying to figure it out myself with these questionable proxies when I could just ask the people who actually know?</p><p>I really can't emphasize enough how huge this is. It would have only taken a few hours, and it would have saved me so much time.</p><p>So why didn't I go out and talk to people in the industry? I'm not quite sure. I think a part of it was that I didn't actually feel like I had to. It seemed pretty clear to me that the market was big, so I was more concerned with making the product awesome.</p><p>Another part of it is that I didn't see it as an option to talk to people in the industry. Because why would they want to talk to little ol' me? They're basically B-list celebrities, in some sense. They've written books. Tons and tons of people know them. Don't these people have hundreds of fan emails every day that they never respond to? That was my thinking in the beginning. Now, I've come to realize that they're just people, and that they're often happy to chat and provide advice.</p><p>It also would have been good if I had access to the actual financial data of my competitors. But none of them are public companies. Does that mean this isn't an option, or are there still ways?</p><p>I came across one <a href=""https://mikemichalowicz.com/how-to-figure-out-your-competitors-revenue/"">cool approach</a> last night. If you don't have access to their financial data, you could look at how many employees they have, and multiply by something like $125k or $200k. Something in that ballpark should give you an idea of their revenue. My competitors, from what I can tell, are all working solo. So that is a sign that they aren't making millions and millions of dollars. Not definitive, but definitely points in that direction.</p><p>Another interesting option is to actually <a href=""https://blog.close.com/start-dialing-why-you-should-call-your-competition-and-how-to-do-it"">call your competitors</a> and talk to them! Eg. you could pretend to be a prospective employee, and in that conversation start asking about revenue and stuff. I'm not sure how I feel about that sort of deception though.</p><p>Here's a closing thought for this section: the world isn't that big. For the majority of my journey, my thoughts on the market size for poker has been, ""I'm not sure exactly how big it is, but it's big enough."" The world is just such a big place, and so many people play poker. The market just <em>has</em> to be huge. Now I realize that this isn't true.</p><h1>""Just another month or two""</h1><p>As I explain in the <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/QGRj2PGiK5eawgQN2/reflections-on-premium-poker-tools-part-1-my-journey"">first post</a>, for a very long time, I kept thinking to myself:</p><blockquote>I'm not sure if I should really pursue this as a business or a long-term thing, but I do know that I want to finish up X, Y and Z. It'll only take a month or two, and I think there's a good chance that it finally gets me over the hump.</blockquote><p>This just kept happening over, and over, and over again. It's crazy.</p><p>And each time it happened, it felt like <em>this</em> was the time it <em>really would</em> only be another month or two. I was wrong last time, and the time before, and the time before, and the time before... but <em>this</em> time... this time I'll be right.</p><p>Wow. Articulating it like that really helps put things in perspective. I need to diagnose myself with a chronic case of the planning fallacy. I need to do a better job of adjusting in the opposite direction. I have a tendency to be <em>over</em>confident, so I need to adjust in the other direction, and be <em>less</em> confident. That's what you have to do with known biases: try to adjust in the other direction.</p><p>And with the planning fallacy in particular, there's a known cure: the <a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Outside_view"">outside view</a>. Don't try to reason from the ground up. Look at how long similar things have taken in the past. Maybe use the reference class of ""times I've thought it'd only be another month or two"".</p><p>Man, that makes me laugh. ""Times I've only thought it'd be another month or two."" Ha! That reference class is full of miscalculations, so it's pretty clear that I need to adjust in the other direction pretty hard.</p><p>I say all of this stuff, but I still worry that I'm going to make the same mistakes again.</p><blockquote>It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law.</blockquote><h1>Agility</h1><p>Check out this excerpt from the <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/QGRj2PGiK5eawgQN2/reflections-on-premium-poker-tools-part-1-my-journey"">first post</a> in this series:</p><hr class=""dividerBlock""><p>And I have this little voice in my head saying:</p><blockquote>Hey Adam... it's been over a year... you don't have <em>any</em> users. This like totally goes against the whole lean startup thing, y'know.</blockquote><p>And then I say in response:</p><blockquote>I know, I know! But I really question whether the lean startup applies to this <em>particular</em> scenario. I <em>know</em> you want to avoid wasting time building things that people don't actually want. That's like the biggest startup sin there is. I know. But like, what am I supposed to do?</blockquote><blockquote>My hypothesis is that once my app gets to the point where it's in the ballpark of Flopzilla or better, that people will want to use it. It takes time to get to that point. There isn't really a quick two week MVP I could build to test that hypothesis. I'm already trying to avoid building non-essential features, and focus on getting to that point as quickly as possible. So what am I supposed to do?</blockquote><blockquote>If I released this and found that I had no users and no one wants this, what would that tell me? Just that people don't like <em>this</em> version of the app enough. Sure, ok. But the real question is whether they'll like the Ballpark Flopzilla version enough, or the Better Than Flopzillla version enough. My hypothesis is that they will, and releasing it now wouldn't invalidate that hypothesis. And I can't think of a way to test those hypotheses quickly. I think I just need to build it and see what happens.</blockquote><p>I'm going to resist the temptation to respond to this right now. Right now I just want to tell the story. The story as it <em>actually</em> happened. But I do want to say that there were a lot of voices swimming around in my head questioning what I was doing.</p><hr class=""dividerBlock""><p>I said in that post that I'm going to resist the temptation to respond to it. Here's where I <em>do</em> get to respond to it.</p><p>Here are my general thoughts about the whole lean startup thing:</p><p>1. I think the essence of it is to ruthlessly avoid spending time on things unnecessarily. Eg. you don't need to spend a week building a fancy navigation menu before you even know whether people want your product. I heartily, heartily support that message.</p><p>2. It can be tempting to think that there are no quick experiments you can run. This is usually wrong. Think more carefully, try to isolate the component assumptions, and get creative.</p><p>I definitely could have done a better job with (2).</p><p>3. But sometimes there <em>truly</em> aren't any quick experiments you can run. Eg. SpaceX. How is SpaceX supposed to build a quick MVP? (Well, there are some things they could do, but I don't want to get distracted from the central point that some hypotheses inherently just take a long time to validate.)</p><p>Now that I'm finished with Premium Poker Tools and am reflecting on what I've learned, it's time to add a fourth general thought.</p><p>4.  If you <em>are</em> in a situation where (3) applies and are going to spend... I don't know... <em>two years and three months </em>testing a hypothesis... then the upside <em>damn well better be worth it!</em></p><p>Pretty obvious. If the risk is big, the reward needs to also be big.</p><p>With Premium Poker Tools, the reward never big enough. It just wasn't. This is no SpaceX.</p><p>Even if my initial ideas about the market size were correct, and there was the potential to make $10-20M, that still isn't enough to justify spending so long testing a hypothesis.</p><p>However, I don't think it's that simple. This issue is very tangled up with the planning fallacy stuff I talked about in the ""Just another month or two"" section. I never actually <em>decided</em> to spend 2+ years on this.</p><h1>Show me the money</h1><p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFrag8ll85w"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFrag8ll85w</a> (I had to)</p><p>I have another objection to the above section. I wasn't testing a hypothesis the whole time. No. About a year into it, I already <em>had</em> market validation. That's right. I already <em>had </em>validation.</p><p>I'm not sure when exactly I would say it occurred, but a big thing is when I posted to Reddit and someone <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/a1n819/free_app_similar_to_flopzilla_and_equilab/earsf9g?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x"">asked</a> where they can donate. Another big thing is <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riyI6kKBl4A&amp;t=255s"">seeing</a> one of the most popular poker players in the world using my app. Another was having a bunch of people <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/axfekk/updates_to_premium_poker_tools/"">tell me</a> that they would pay for it. Another is having random people email me thanking me for building the app and telling me how great it is.</p><p>Now, I know they say talk is cheap. I know how startup people always want to see <em>traction</em>. Users. Money. Growth. I didn't have any of that. But I did have all of the other stuff in the above paragraph! People said so many nice things to me. Sure, conventional wisdom might say that the above paragraph isn't enough, and that you need <em>real</em> traction...</p><p>But I'm a <em>Bayesian!</em> I'm better than that! Saying that you need <em>actual</em> traction is like how the scientific community waits <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/fxynfGCSHpY4FmBZy/p/xTyuQ3cgsPjifr7oj"">too long</a> before accepting something as true. Being a Bayesian, I can update in inches. I can be faster than science. I can be faster than conventional startup wisdom.</p><p>Well, that's how I used to think anyways. Now I run around my apartment with my fingers in my ears yelling SHOW ME THE MONEY!!!!!!!!!</p><p>I'm exaggerating of course. I don't actually do that. And I don't actually think you should ignore everything except ""actual results"". No, I'm still a Bayesian, and Bayesians don't throw away evidence. But given my experiences, I've come to believe that such evidence isn't <em>nearly</em> as strong as I had previously thought.</p><h1>Deals fall through</h1><p>This is similar to the above section. In the above section, I'm basically talking about how when people say ""This app is awesome! I would pay for it!"" it doesn't actually mean that much. This section is going to talk about how when potential business partners say ""This is really interesting! Let's talk more!"" or even ""I'm in!"", it doesn't actually mean that much.</p><p>You can read more about it in <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/QGRj2PGiK5eawgQN2/reflections-on-premium-poker-tools-part-1-my-journey"">part one</a>, but I've just had so many deals and stuff fall through. A lot of people were telling me that they were interested in working with me. Some even said that they <em>would</em> work with me. A verbal ""yes"". I thought to myself:</p><blockquote>Ok, great! This is pretty strong bayesian evidence right here. I wouldn't have so many people saying this stuff if they didn't mean it. Sure, maybe a few fall through, but not everyone.</blockquote><blockquote>And also, I haven't even put myself out there too much. Just to throw out a number, maybe I've talked to 10% of the potential people who I could partner with. If I've gotten this much interest from the 10%, once I go after the 90%, I should end up with a good amount of partnerships.</blockquote><p>Given my experiences, I've come to believe that verbal interest just isn't that telling. And this seems to mirror the experiences of others as well.</p><p>I don't want to say that verbal interest means nothing though. Honestly, I probably  went too far in the above paragraph saying that it ""just isn't that telling"". I still have limited experience, and I'm not sure how strongly to weigh it as evidence.</p><p>But one thing does seem pretty clear: the lack of actual traction is stronger evidence than verbal interest. Eg. for me, I had a lot of people <em>saying</em> they're interested in partnering with me, but no one actually following through. I think the lack of follow through is stronger evidence than the verbal interest. Similarly, I had a lot of people <em>saying</em> they really like the app and stuff, but even when it was free I was only getting maybe 100 users/month, and they weren't spending that much time on the app. I should have paid more attention to that.</p><h1>Build it and they'll come</h1><p>I've always had a perspective that goes something like this:</p><blockquote>My app is at least in the same ballpark as Flopzilla. I feel pretty confident that it's a little bit better, actually. So then, I would think I should at least get 10-20% of the market, if not more.</blockquote><blockquote>Yes, I know they were the first mover and have the brand recognition, but if my product is in the ballpark, I should still make a dent. I release it, people hear about it, some people like it and start using it, they tell their friends, people link to it in forums, put screenshots in blog posts, etc. I would think that if my product is as good as the market leader, through a process something like what I just described, I would get my slice of the pie.</blockquote><blockquote>Furthermore, I would expect my slice to be proportionate to the quality of my product. If the product is a little worse than the competitors, maybe my slice is 5%. If it's a little better, maybe I get 30-40%. If it's way better, maybe it's 75%.</blockquote><blockquote>And maybe that perspective is too optimistic. That's certainly possible. But it can't be <em>too</em> off the mark, right? Maybe if the product is a little worse I end up with 1% instead of 5%. Maybe if it's only a little better I get 5-10% instead of 30-40%. Maybe if it's way better I get 50% instead of 75%.</blockquote><p>Although it's still a little counterintuitive to me, I have to say that my perspective is different now. The perspective I described above is some version of ""build it and they'll come"" (BIATC). I now thing that BIATC is pretty wrong.</p><p>I'm still not quite sure what the mechanism is, though. I suppose that it takes a lot to actually get word of mouth to happen. I suppose people don't actually do that much comparison shopping, and instead lean heavily towards things that are popular, have social proof, and that they stumble across organically, eg. in blogs.</p><p>I feel like I may have overestimated BIATC due the stuff I hear from YC folks. They talk a lot about focusing heavily on the product, as opposed to marketing it. I at least get the impression from them that making something people want is what it's all about, and that if you manage to do so, you'll have success. Here's Paul Graham in <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/start.html"">How to Start a Startup</a>:</p><blockquote>It's not just startups that have to worry about this. I think most businesses that fail do it because they don't give customers what they want. Look at restaurants. A large percentage fail, about a quarter in the first year. But can you think of one restaurant that had really good food and went out of business?</blockquote><blockquote>Restaurants with great food seem to prosper no matter what. A restaurant with great food can be expensive, crowded, noisy, dingy, out of the way, and even have bad service, and people will keep coming. It's true that a restaurant with mediocre food can sometimes attract customers through gimmicks. But that approach is very risky. It's more straightforward just to make the food good.</blockquote><p>Using the example of restaurants, I actually can think of a lot of restaurants with great food that don't do so well. Hole-in-the-wall-type places with awesome food, but that are never too busy. And on the other hand, I can think of a lot of trendier restaurants that have terrible food but a lot of customers.</p><p>Still, I don't want to completely discount BIATC. I think it can be true in some situations. I just think those situations have to be pretty extreme. You need to 10x your competition. You need to be solving a hair on fire problem. You need to be building a painkiller, not a vitamin. You need your users to really, really love you. When you totally blow the competition away, or when you truly solve an important problem that hasn't been solved yet, yeah, when you build it, they'll come. Maybe that's what YC is trying to convey.</p><h1>Customer acquisition is hard</h1><p>Of course, I didn't actually just build my app and sit there expecting people to come to me. I did try to acquire customers.</p><p>It just didn't work. Despite the fact that I have a product that people say all of these nice things about, I only managed to get, let's say three paid users and 100 free trial sign ups. That amount of traction seems very much not in line with the quality of product I have, which makes me think that customer acquisition is very hard. Or maybe just that I'm still bad at it.</p><p>Here's what I tried, how it went, and what I learned:</p><h2>Affiliate partnerships</h2><p>This has always been Plan A. Find some people who already have huge followings eg. on YouTube, and piggyback off of that by offering them revenue share. Should be pretty simple. It's free money for them, and the product is good, so why wouldn't they want to do it? Especially when I ended up offering them 50%.</p><p>Well, I'm still not quite sure what the answer to that is.</p><p>Maybe they know how small the market is and how little money they'd make? Perhaps. But still, it's so low effort for them to throw a link in the description. And they're often already using poker software in their posts/books/videos, so it isn't any <em>extra</em> effort for them to use mine. In fact, mine is a better fit because mine is the only web app, and they could link to simulation results.</p><p>In talking to them, the response I usually get is that they've been meaning to check the app out but just haven't had time. This makes no sense to me because as poker professionals, I'd think that they are already spending time studying with software, so why not substitute mine in? Maybe they don't actually study? Maybe they don't want to spend the time messing around with a product they're unfamiliar with? Who knows.</p><p>My takeaway here is that if the deal you're offering people is only marginally beneficial, you might just end up with no partners.</p><h2>YouTube and blogging</h2><p>I think I have produced solid content with my YouTube channel and blog. People have told me that. But I've gotten only a minuscule amount of hits.</p><p>Again, my initial thinking was what I described in BIATC. That the amount of hits I get should be at least <em>roughly</em> proportional to the quality of my content.</p><p>Nope! That didn't happen! In retrospect, this makes sense. How are people supposed to discover your YouTube videos? YouTube recommends videos that are already popular, and chooses the videos that are already popular to put high in their search results. Similar with blogging. It's a chicken-egg problem that I have yet to figure out.</p><h2>Paid advertising</h2><p>There are a ton of huge companies built off of ad revenue: Google, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Reddit, etc. So then, that gives me the impression that paid ads are a huge thing that everyone is doing. And if they're doing it, they're doing it because it works for them, presumably. So paid ads have always been something that I assumed to work well.</p><p>Nope! The first place I learned this was in Julian Shapiro's <a href=""https://www.julian.com/guide/growth/ad-channels"">guide</a>. He said something that made it actually seem pretty clear in retrospect. If you <em>were</em> able to get an ad channel working profitably for you, you'd just be able to scale up with that channel, acquiring customers profitably, and making a ton of money. If every company were able to do that, entrepreneurship would be pretty easy.</p><p>Since reading his stuff, I started to hear other people say the same things, that it's really hard to do profitably and most companies never manage to do so. I still decided to give paid ads a shot, because it's a low risk high reward thing, but it turned out not to work for me.</p><h2>Direct sales</h2><p>I spent a pretty good amount of time doing direct sales. Some in person networking at a poker meetup, playing poker at the casinos, meeting people in coffee shops, Ubers, etc. Then I also spent some time DMing people on poker forums, and emailing poker players and coaches. I didn't go too crazy because I don't want to be spammy, but I definitely did some.</p><p>None of it really worked though. I think my takeaway mirrors the BIATC stuff, where you need to have something really valuable to actually get peoples attention.</p><p>I again found this surprising. I figured that when you actually are in a conversation with someone, they'd sort of give you the benefit of the doubt. But no, I didn't find that to be true.</p><h2>Refer a friend</h2><p>There was a point where I was offering $20 for every friend you refer. Pretty good, right?! Seemed pretty generous to me, and like something people would want to take advantage of. But no, that didn't happen. Still confusing to me, but I guess the lesson again is that it really takes a lot to get peoples attention.</p><h2>Sharable simulation links</h2><p>(I talk more about this in <a href=""https://www.indiehackers.com/product/premium-poker-tools/a-marketing-strategy-that-hasnt-worked-yet--LaCIG5WI5K_XO6Gs5jc"">this post</a>.)</p><p>Poker players spend a lot of time in forums discussing hands. They'll say things like, ""you only have 33% equity, so you should fold"". My app lets you link to a simulation that shows that you only have <a href=""https://premiumpokertools.com/equity-calculator/5d9fce535fdc260017da922e"">33% equity</a>. For non-users, it's in readonly mode. For users, when they could click the link and play around with the assumptions.</p><p>I thought this would be huge. Making it easier for people to discuss hands in the forums. But no, it did nothing. I think a big part of it is that most people in the forums approach it very casually and don't want to spend a lot of time on their comments. They just want to add their two cents, and then leave.</p><h2>Free</h2><p>The app was even <em>free</em> for a long period of time. I would have thought that this would attract a ton of users, but no, that didn't happen. More evidence that it takes a lot to actually get people to look in your direction, and that customer acquisition is hard.</p><h1>People are lazy and irrational</h1><p>Here's what I mean. It's really true that if you're a poker player and are actually trying to get better, that you should have some sort of poker software to study with. Coaches and professionals say this all the time. But people are still too lazy to do so.</p><p>Hell, they are just too lazy to study in general. I've said this before, but they prefer passive things. Watching a video and having someone ""tell you the answers"", even though that sort of passive study never works, regardless of the field. Eg. with math, you have to actually do a lot of practice problems yourself to get it to stick.</p><p>I've also heard a lot of coaches complain about students who pay them $100+/hr not do the homework that they are assigned. The coaches beg and plead, but the students just don't want to do the work.</p><p>That's the lazy part. I guess the irrational part plays into that, but what I really had in mind is that poker software is pretty easily a +ROI investment, but people still don't care. And if poker players aren't persuaded by +ROI investments, then I'm not sure what other demographic would be persuaded.</p><h1>Everything else</h1><p>There are definitely things that I'm forgetting. Hopefully I'll add to this post as I remember them.</p><p>If any readers out there have any advice, I'm all ears! I want to try to learn as much as I can from this.</p>",adamzerner,adamzerner,Adam Zerner,

Now in divine operations even the smallest beginnings lead unstoppably to their end. It was said of spiritual things that ‘The kingdom of God cometh not with observation’ [<em>Luke</em> 17:20], and it is the same with all the greater works of divine providence: everything glides on smoothly and noiselessly, and the work is well under way before men are aware that it has begun. And don’t forget Daniel’s prophecy concerning the last ages of the world: ‘Many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased’ [<em>Daniel</em> 12:4], clearly indicating that the thorough exploration of the whole world is fated to coincide with the advancement of the sciences. (By ‘fated’ I mean ‘destined by ·God’s· providence’. I would add that there have been so many distant voyages that ‘the thorough exploration of the whole world’ seems to have reached completion or to be well on the way to it.)</p><p><strong>94.</strong> Next topic: the best of all reasons for having <strong>hope</strong>, namely <em>the errors of the past, the wrong roads so far taken</em>. In the course of censuring a poorly run government the critic said something excellent:</p><blockquote>The worst things in the past ought to be regarded as the best for the future. For if you had conducted yourself perfectly yet still ended up in your present ·miserable· condition, you would have not even a <strong><em>hope</em></strong> of improvement. But as things stand, with your misfortunes being due not to the circumstances but to your own errors, you can <strong>hope</strong> that by abandoning or correcting these errors you can make a great change for the better.</blockquote><p>Similarly, if throughout many years men had gone the right way about discovering and cultivating the sciences, and the sciences had still been in the state they are now actually in, it would have been absurdly bold to think that further progress was possible. But if the wrong road has been taken, and men have worked on things that weren’t worthwhile, it follows that the troubles have arisen not from •circumstances that weren’t in our power but from •the human intellect—and the use and application of <em>that</em> can be remedied. So it will be really useful to expound these errors; because every harm they have done in the past gives us reason to <strong>hope</strong> to do better in the future. I have already said a little about these errors, but I think I should set them out here in plain and simple words.</p><p><strong>95.</strong> Those who have been engaged in the sciences divide into <em>experimenters</em> and <em>theorists</em>. The experimenters, like •ants, merely collect and use ·particular facts·; the theorists, like •spiders, make webs out of themselves. But the •bee takes a middle course: it gathers its material from the flowers of the garden and the field, but uses its own powers to transform and absorb this material. A true worker at philosophy is like that:</p><ul><li>he doesn’t rely solely or chiefly on the powers of the mind ·like a theorist = spider·, and</li><li>he doesn’t take the material that he gathers from natural history and physical experiments and store it up in his memory just as he finds it ·like an experimenter = ant·. Instead,</li><li>he stores the material in his intellect, altered and brought under control.</li></ul><p>So there is much to <strong>hope</strong> for from a closer and purer collaboration between these two strands in science, experimental and theoretical—a collaboration that has never occurred before now.</p><p><strong>96.</strong> We have never yet had a natural philosophy that was pure. What we have had has always been tainted and spoiled: in Aristotle’s school by logic; in Plato’s by natural theology; in the second school of Platonists (Proclus and others) by mathematics, which ought only to set natural philosophy’s limits, not generate it or give it birth. From a pure and unmixed natural philosophy we can <strong>hope</strong> for better things ·than can be expected from any of those impure systems·.</p><p><strong>97.</strong> No-one has yet been found who was sufficiently firm of mind and purpose to decide on <em>and to carry out</em> this programme:</p><blockquote>Clean right out all theories and common notions, and apply the intellect—thus scrubbed clean and evenly balanced—to a fresh examination of particulars.</blockquote><p>[[By <em>particulars, </em>Bacon likely means something close to specific individual data points and observations.]]</p><p>For want of this, the human knowledge that we have is a mish-mash, composed of •childish notions that we took in along with our mothers’ milk, together with •·the results of· much credulity and many stray happenings. So if someone of mature years, with functioning senses and a well-purged mind, makes a fresh start on examining experience and particular events, better things may be <strong>hoped</strong> for from him. In this respect, I pledge myself to have good fortune like that of Alexander the Great. Don’t accuse me of vanity until you have heard me out, because what I am getting at—taken as a whole—goes <em>against</em> vanity. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeschines"">Aeschines</a> said of Alexander and his deeds: ‘Assuredly we don’t live the life of mortal men. What we were born for was that in after ages wonders might be told of us’, as though Alexander’s deeds seemed to him miraculous. But ·what I am saying about myself is not like that, but rather like this·: in the next age Livy took a better and a deeper view of the matter, saying of Alexander that ‘all he did was to have the courage to neglect sources of fear that were negligible’. I think that a similar judgment may be passed on me in future ages: that I did no great things, but simply cut down to size things that had been regarded as great. . . .</p><p><strong>98.</strong> We can’t do without experience; but so far we haven’t had any foundations for experience, or only very weak ones. No-one has searched out and stored up a great mass of particular events that is adequate</p><ul><li>in number,</li><li>in kind,</li><li>in certainty, or</li><li>in any other way</li></ul><p>to inform the intellect. On the contrary, learned men— relaxed and idle—have accepted, as having the weight of legitimate evidence for constructing or confirming their philosophy, bits of hearsay and rumours about experience. Think of a kingdom or state that manages its affairs on the basis not of •letters and reports from ambassadors and trustworthy messengers but of •street-gossip and the gutter! Well, the way philosophy has managed its relations with experience has been <em>exactly</em> like that.</p><ul><li>Nothing examined in enough careful detail,</li><li>nothing verified,</li><li>nothing counted,</li><li>nothing weighed,</li><li>nothing measured</li></ul><p>is to be found in natural history. And observations that are loose and unsystematic lead to ideas that are deceptive and treacherous. Perhaps you think that this is a strange thing to say. You may want to comment:</p><blockquote>Your complaint is unfair. Aristotle—a great man, supported by the wealth of a great king—composed an accurate natural history of animals; and others, with greater diligence though making less fuss about it, made many additions; while yet others compiled rich histories and descriptions of metals, plants, and fossils.</blockquote><p>If so, it seems that you haven’t properly grasped what I am saying here. For the rationale of a •natural history that is composed for its own sake is not like the rationale of a •natural history that is collected to supply the intellect with the concepts it needs for building up philosophy. They differ in many ways, but especially in this: the former attends only to the variety of natural species ·as they are found in nature·, not to ·deliberately constructed· experiments in the mechanical arts. In the business of life, the best way to discover a man’s character, the secrets of how his mind works, is to see how he handles trouble. In just the same way, nature’s secrets come to light better when she is artificially shaken up than when she goes her own way. So we can <strong>hope</strong> for good things from natural philosophy when natural history—which is its ground-floor and foundation—is better organized. Then, but not until then!</p><p><strong>99.</strong> Furthermore, even when there are plenty of mechanical experiments, there’s a great scarcity of ones that do much to enlarge the mind’s stock of concepts. The experimental technician isn’t concerned with discovering the truth, and isn’t willing to raise his mind or stretch out his hand for anything that doesn’t bear on his ·practical· project. There will be grounds for <strong>hope</strong> of scientific advances when ·and only when· men assemble a good number of natural-history experiments that •are in themselves of no ·practical· use but simply •serve to discover causes and axioms. I call these ‘experiments of light’, to distinguish them from the ·practically useful but theoretically sterile· ones that I call ‘experiments of fruit’ [here ‘fruit’ = ‘practical results’]. Now, experiments of this kind have one admirable property: they never miss or fail! Their aim is not to •produce some particular effect but only to •discover the natural cause of something; and such an experiment succeeds equally well however it turns out, for either way it settles the question.</p><p><strong>100.</strong> Many more experiments should be devised and carried out, and ones of an utterly different kind from any we have had up to now. But that is not all. There should also be introduced an entirely different method, order, and procedure for carrying through a programme of experiments. To repeat something I have already said [<strong>82</strong>]: when experimentation wanders around of its own accord, it merely gropes in the dark and confuses men rather than instructing them. But when there is a firmly regulated, uninterrupted <em>series</em> of experiments, there is <strong>hope</strong> for advances in knowledge.</p><p><strong>101.</strong> Even after we have acquired and have ready at hand a store of natural history and experimental results such as is required for the work of the intellect, or of philosophy, <em>still</em> that is not enough. The intellect is far from being able to retain all this material in memory and recall it at will, any more than a man could keep a diary all in his head. Yet until now there has been more <em>thinking</em> than <em>writing</em> about discovery procedures—experimentation hasn’t yet become <em>literate</em>! But a discovery isn’t worth much if it isn’t ·planned and reported· in writing; and when this becomes the standard practice, better things can be <strong>hoped</strong> for from experimental procedures that have at last been made literate.</p><p><strong>102.</strong> The particulars ·that have to be studied· are very numerous, and are like an army that is dispersed across a wide terrain, threatening to scatter and bewilder the intellect ·that tries to engage with them·. There’s not much to be <strong>hoped</strong> for from intellectual skirmishing ·with these particulars·, dashing here and there among them in a disorderly way. What is needed is first •to get the relevant particulars drawn up and arranged, doing this by means of tables of discovery that are well selected, well arranged, and <em>fresh</em> (as though living); and •to put the mind to work on the prepared and arranged helps that these tables provide.</p><p>[[By <em>axiom</em>, Bacon means something akin to <em>hypothesis </em>or <em>model.</em>]]</p><p><strong>103.</strong> But after this store of particulars has been laid before our eyes in an orderly way, we shouldn’t pass straight on to the investigation and discovery of new particulars or new discoveries; or anyway if we <em>do</em> do that we oughtn’t to stop there. I don’t deny that when all the experiments of all the arts have been collected and ordered and brought within the knowledge and judgment of one man, new useful things may be discovered through taking the experimental results of one art and re-applying them to a different art (using the approach to experiments that I have called ‘literate’, ·meaning that the results are properly recorded in writing·). But nothing much can be <strong>hoped</strong> for from that procedure. Much more promising is this: from those particular results derive axioms in a methodical manner, then let the light of the axioms point the way to new particulars. For our road does not lie on a level, but goes up and down—up to axioms, then down again to scientific practice.</p><p>[[For a modern plain English description of Bacon's method see: <strong><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductivism"">1</a></strong>, <strong><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baconian_method"">2</a></strong>, <strong><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning#Enumerative_induction"">3</a></strong>.</p><p>A concrete example of what Bacon is discussing might be as follows:</p><blockquote>Particular: you observe that both parents of sparrows care for their young*.</blockquote><blockquote>Highly-General Axiom/Hypothesis: both sexes of all bird species care for the young;</blockquote><blockquote>Medium-General Hypothesis: both of sexes small birds care for their young;</blockquote><blockquote>Narrow Axiom/Hypotheses: Some of both sexes of sparrows living in South England care for their young.</blockquote><p>Aristotle might start with a fews observations or a folk belief that some birds of both sexes care for their young and then formulate a universal truth: <em>For all X such that X is a bird, it cares for its young</em>. By syllogism, Aristotle will derive new particular cases: <em>Robins are are kind of bird therefore box sexes of Robins care for their young. </em>This is syllogistic demonstration.</p><p>Bacon states that the Aristotelian approach is utterly invalid and instead one musts only generalize modestly from observations, using each expansion of the generalization to seek out further evidence which will either confirm or deny further expansion.</p><p>*This is a fictitious example.]]</p><p><strong>104.</strong> But the intellect mustn’t be allowed •to jump—to <em>fly</em>—from particulars a long way up to axioms that are of almost the highest generality (such as the so-called ‘first principles’ of arts and of things) and then on the basis of them (taken as unshakable truths) •to ‘prove’ and thus secure middle axioms. That has been the practice up to now, because the intellect has a natural impetus to do that and has for many years been trained and habituated in doing it by the use of syllogistic demonstration. Our only <strong>hope</strong> for good results in the sciences is for us to proceed thus: using a valid ladder, we move up gradually—not in leaps and bounds—from particulars to lower axioms, then to middle axioms, then up and up until at last we reach the most general axioms. ·The two ends of this ladder are relatively unimportant· because the lowest axioms are not much different from ·reports on· bare experience, while the highest and most general ones—or anyway the ones that we have now—are notional and abstract and without solid content. It’s the middle axioms that are true and solid and alive; they are the ones on which the affairs and fortunes of men depend. Above them are the most general axioms, ·which also have value, but· I am talking not about abstract axioms but rather about ones of which the middle axioms are limitations ·and which thus get content from the middle axioms·. So the human intellect should be •supplied not with wings but rather •weighed down with lead, to keep it from leaping and flying. This hasn’t ever been done; when it <em>is</em> done we’ll be entitled to better <strong>hopes</strong> of the sciences.</p><p><strong>105.</strong> For establishing axioms we have to devise a different form of induction from any that has been use up to now, and it should be used for proving and discovering not only so-called ‘first principles’ but also the lesser middle axioms— indeed <em>all</em> axioms. The induction that proceeds by simply listing positive instances is a childish affair; its conclusions are precarious and exposed to peril from a contradictory instance; and it generally reaches its conclusions on the basis of too few facts—merely the ones that happen to be easily available. A form of induction that will be useful for discovery and demonstration in the sciences and the arts will have •to separate out a nature through appropriate rejections and exclusions, and then, after a sufficient number of negatives, •to reach a conclusion on the affirmative instances. [Bacon will start to explain this in 2-<strong>15</strong>.] No-one has ever done this, or even <em>tried to</em>, except for Plato who does indeed make some use of this form of induction for the purpose of discussing definitions and ideas. But for this kind of induction (or demonstration) to be properly equipped for its work, <em>many</em> things have to be done that until now no mortal has given a thought to; so that much more work will have to be spent on this than has ever been spent on the syllogism. And this induction should be used not only in the discovery of axioms but also in drawing boundaries around notions. It is in this induction that our chief <strong>hope</strong> lies.</p><p>[[Here Bacon again mentions the importance of <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/rmAbiEKQDpDnZzcRf/positive-bias-look-into-the-dark"">Looking Into the Dark</a>.]]</p><p><strong>106.</strong> When establishing an axiom by this kind of induction, we must carefully note whether the axiom is shaped so as to fit only the particulars from which it is derived, rather than being larger and wider. And if it <em>is</em> larger and wider, we must see whether its greater scope is confirmed and justified by new particulars that it leads us to. Such a justified increase of scope saves us from being stuck with things that are already known (but if it isn’t justified then we are over-stretching, loosely grasping at shadows and abstract forms rather than at solid things in the world of matter). When we do things in this way we shall at last have justified <strong>hope</strong>.</p><p><strong>107.</strong> At this point I should remind you of what I said earlier [<strong>80</strong>] about extending the range of natural philosophy so that the particular sciences can be grounded in it, and the branches of knowledge don’t get lopped off from the trunk. For without that there will be little <strong>hope</strong> of progress.</p><p><em>The next post in the sequence, Book 1: 108-130 (Reasons for Hope &amp; Objection Preemption), will be posted Thursday, October 17 at latest by 4:00pm PDT.</em></p>",Francis Bacon,francis-bacon,Francis Bacon,

In my post about 

<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/thermal-mass-thermos"">keeping dry food
warm in school lunches</a> I wrote that ""The general rule is that hot
food shouldn't be below 140F (60C) for more than two hours, because
substantial bacteria can grow, and the closer it is to 100F (37C)the
worse it is.""  Someone said they had heard 130F (55C) was the limit,
and asked where this rule came from, and I read more about it.



</p><p>

Bacteria that's most dangerous to us generally thrive best around body
temperature, so the farther you get from 100F (37C) the better.  Food
safety material generally describes this as a ""danger zone"", between
refrigerator temperature and cooking temperature.  This is what's
represented in the FDA's <a href=""https://www.fda.gov/media/110822/download"">Food Code</a>:

</p>

<p>

</p>

<blockquote>

3-501.19.B.1

  
Time as a Public Health Control: Time - maximum up to 4
          hours:
      <p>The FOOD shall have an initial temperature of 5C (41F) or
          less when removed from cold holding temperature control, or
          57C (135F) or greater when removed from hot holding
          temperature control</p>



</blockquote>



<p>

It gives more detail in section 3-501.16's ""The Safety of the Time as
a Public Health Control Provision from Cooking Temperatures (135F or
above) to Ambient"":

</p>

<blockquote>FDA conducted in-house laboratory experiments to test the
safety of the existing TPHC provisions of 4 hours without temperature
control starting with an initial temperature of 135F or
above. Clostridium perfringens was chosen to represent a worst case
scenario pathogen for foods allowed to cool from cooking temperatures
to ambient without temperature control, because its spores can survive
normal cooking procedures, it can grow at relatively high temperatures
(&gt;120F) and it has a short lag period. C. perfringens spores were
inoculated into foods that were cooked and then cooled to yield a
cooling curve that would promote outgrowth as quickly as possible. The
growth data suggest that the existing 4-hour TPHC provision will be
safe for 6 hours after cooking, with the additional 2-hour margin of
safety built-in for consumer handling.</blockquote>



<p>

There's a great chart in <a href=""https://www.foodsafetymagazine.com/magazine-archive1/februarymarch-2004/the-danger-zone-reevaluated/"">The
""Danger Zone"" Reevaluated</a> by Frank Bryan, showing how long food

</p>

<p>

Since the time I care about is 4hr from packing to eating, even under
the food code guidelines it should be safe if it starts at cooking or
refrigerator temperatures.  To be safe, though, I'm going to keep
using the thermal mass thermos approach.

</blockquote>
<p>Yesterday, I eagerly opened my copy of Stuart Russell's <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Human-Compatible-Artificial-Intelligence-Problem/dp/0525558616""><em>Human Compatible</em></a> (mirroring his <em>Center for Human-Compatible AI</em>, where I've worked the past two summers). I've been curious about Russell's research agenda, and <em>also</em> how Russell argued the case so convincingly as to garner the following acclamations from two Turing Award winners:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Human Compatible made me a convert to Russell's concerns with our ability to control our upcoming creation—super-intelligent machines. Unlike outside alarmists and futurists, Russell is a leading authority on AI. His new book will educate the public about AI more than any book I can think of, and is a delightful and uplifting read.—Judea Pearl</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This beautifully written book addresses a fundamental challenge for humanity: increasingly intelligent machines that do what we ask but not what we really intend.  Essential reading if you care about our future. —Yoshua Bengio</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bengio even recently lent a reasoned voice to a <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/WxW6Gc6f2z3mzmqKs/debate-on-instrumental-convergence-between-lecun-russell"">debate on instrumental convergence</a>!</p>
<h1>Bringing the AI community up-to-speed</h1>
<p>I think the book will greatly help AI professionals understand key arguments, avoid classic missteps, and appreciate the serious challenge humanity faces. Russell straightforwardly debunks common objections, writing with both candor and charm.</p>
<p>I must admit, it's great to see such a prominent debunking; I still remember, early in my concern about alignment, hearing one professional respond to the entire idea of being concerned about AGI with a lazy <em>ad hominem</em> dismissal. Like, hello? This is our future we're talking about!</p>
<p>But Russell realizes that most people don't intentionally argue in bad faith; he structures his arguments with the understanding and charity required to ease the difficulty of changing one's mind. (Although I wish he'd be a <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/WxW6Gc6f2z3mzmqKs/debate-on-instrumental-convergence-between-lecun-russell"">little less sassy with LeCun</a>, understandable as his frustration may be)</p>
<p>More important than having fish, however, is knowing how to fish; Russell helps train the right mental motions in his readers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With a bit of practice, you can learn to identify ways in which the achievement of more or less any fixed objective can result in arbitrarily bad outcomes. [Russell goes on to describe specific examples and strategies] (p139)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He somehow explains the difference between the Platonic assumptions of RL and the reality of a human-level reasoner, <em>while also</em> introducing wireheading. He covers the <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/bG4PR9uSsZqHg2gYY/utility-reward"">utility-reward gap</a>, explaining that our understanding of real-world agency is so crude that we can't even coherently talk about the ""purpose"" of eg AlphaGo. He explains instrumental subgoals. These bits are so, so good.</p>
<p>Now for the main course, for those already familiar with the basic arguments:</p>
<h1>The agenda</h1>
<p><em>Please realize that I'm replying to my understanding of Russell's agenda as communicated in a nontechnical book for the general public; I also don't have a mental model of Russell personally. Still, I'm working with what I've got.</em></p>
<p>Here's my summary: reward uncertainty through some extension of a CIRL-like setup, accounting for human irrationality through our scientific knowledge, doing aggregate preference utilitarianism for all of the humans on the planet, discounting people by how well their beliefs map to reality, perhaps downweighting motivations such as envy (to mitigate the problem of everyone wanting <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positional_good"">positional goods</a>). One challenge is towards what preference-shaping situations the robot should guide us (maybe we need meta-preference learning?). Russell also has a vision of many agents, each working to reasonably pursue the wishes of their owners (while being considerate of others).</p>
<p>I'm going to simplify the situation and just express my concerns about the case of one irrational human, one robot.</p>
<p>There's <a href=""https://arbital.com/p/updated_deference/"">fully updated deference</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One possible scheme in AI alignment is to give the AI a state of moral uncertainty implying that we know more than the AI does about its own utility function, as the AI's meta-utility function defines its ideal target. Then we could tell the AI, ""You should let us shut you down because we know something about your ideal target that you don't, and we estimate that we can optimize your ideal target better without you.""</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The obstacle to this scheme is that belief states of this type also tend to imply that an even better option for the AI would be to learn its ideal target by observing us. Then, having 'fully updated', the AI would have no further reason to 'defer' to us, and could proceed to directly optimize its ideal target.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which Russell partially addresses by advocating ensuring realizability, and avoiding feature misspecification by (somehow) allowing for dynamic addition of previously unknown features (see also <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.06275""><em>Incorrigibility in the CIRL Framework</em></a>). But supposing we don't have this kind of model misspecification, I don't see how the ""AI simply fully computes the human's policy, updates, and then no longer lets us correct it"" issue is addressed. If you're really confident that computing the human policy lets you just extract the true preferences under the realizability assumptions, maybe this is fine? I suspect Russell has more to say here that didn't make it onto the printed page.</p>
<p>There's also the issue of getting a good enough human mistake model, <em>and</em> figuring out people's beliefs, all while attempting to learn their preferences (see the <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/4dHMdK5TLN6xcqtyc"">value learning</a> sequence).</p>
<p>Now, it would be pretty silly to reply to an outlined research agenda with ""but specific problems X, Y, and Z!"", because the whole point of further research is to solve problems. However, my concerns are more structural. Certain AI designs lend themselves to more robustness against things going wrong (in specification, training, or simply having fewer assumptions). It seems to me that the uncertainty-based approach is quite demanding on getting component after component ""right enough"".</p>
<p>Let me give you an example of something which is intuitively ""more robust"" to me: <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7Hr8t6xwuuxBTqADK/approval-directed-agents-1"">approval-directed agency</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Consider a human Hugh, and an agent Arthur who uses the following procedure to choose each action:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Estimate the expected rating Hugh would give each action if he considered it at length. Take the action with the highest expected rating.</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, the approval-policy does what a predictor says to do at each time step, which is different from maximizing a signal. Its <em>shape</em> feels different to me; the policy isn't <em>shaped</em> to maximize some reward signal (and pursue instrumental subgoals). Errors in prediction almost certainly don't produce a policy adversarial to human interests.</p>
<p>How does this compare with the uncertainty approach? Let's consider one thing it seems we need to get right:</p>
<h2>Where in the world is the human?</h2>
<p>How will the agent robustly locate the human whose preferences it's learning, and why do we need to worry about this?</p>
<p>Well, a novice might worry ""what if the AI doesn't properly cleave reality at its  joints, relying on a bad representation of the world?"". But, having good predictive accuracy is instrumentally useful for maximizing the reward signal, so we can expect that its implicit representation of the world continually improves (i.e., it comes to find a nice efficient encoding). We don't have to worry about this - the AI is incentivized to get this right.</p>
<p>However, if the AI is meant to deduce and further the preferences of that single human, it has to find that human. But, before the AI is operational, how do we point to <em>our</em> concept of ""this person"" in a yet-unformed model whose encoding probably doesn't cleave reality along those same lines? Even if we fix the structure of the AI's model so we <em>can</em> point to that human, it might then have instrumental incentives to modify the model so it can make better predictions.</p>
<p>Why does it matter so much that we point exactly to the human? Well, then we're extrapolating the ""preferences"" of something that is not the person (or a person?) - the predicted human policy in this case seems highly sensitive to the details of the person or entity being pointed to. This seems like it could easily end in tragedy, and (strong belief, weakly held) doesn't seem like the kind of problem that has a clean solution. this sort of thing seems to happen quite often for proposals which hinge on things-in-ontologies.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/4dHMdK5TLN6xcqtyc/p/cnC2RMWEGiGpJv8go"">Human action models, mistake models, etc. are also difficult in this way</a>, and we have to get them right. I'm not necessarily worried about the difficulties themselves, but that the framework seems so sensitive to them.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>This book is most definitely an important read for both the general public and AI specialists, presenting a thought-provoking agenda with worthwhile insights (even if I don't see how it all ends up fitting together). To me, this seems like a key tool for outreach.</p>
<p>Just think: in how many worlds does alignment research benefit from the advocacy of one of the most distinguished AI researchers ever?</p>

We model particular pieces of reality with particular mathematical structures (e.g., we model shapes with geometry), so generalizing how we model the world and generalizing fields of mathematics are highly related tasks.</p><p>Because I'm assuming my audience isn't familiar with any mathematical structures, we can't just start tossing out examples. Essentially the art of ""categorifying"" a mathematical structure is as simple as identifying what are the objects and what are the associatively composable morphisms. See <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_(mathematics)#Examples"">here</a> for a list of examples (scroll down to the table), which ought to give you an idea that many different kinds of mathematics really are just examples of categories on some level.</p><p>To give just one example of a mathematical structure generalized by category theory, you might be relatively familiar with the category known as <strong>Set</strong>, the category whose objects are <em>sets</em> and whose morphisms are <em>functions</em>—functions being very nice maps between sets. Functions compose, as we've already seen, and you can check that this composition is associative, so, voila, we've ""categorified"" a mathematical structure.</p><p><strong>Set as category</strong>:</p><p><u>Objects</u>: sets</p><p><u>Morphisms</u>: functions</p><p><u>Identity morphism</u>: identity function <span><style>.mjx-chtml {display: inline-block; line-height: 0; text-indent: 0; text-align: left; text-transform: none; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 100%; font-size-adjust: none; letter-spacing: normal; word-wrap: normal; word-spacing: normal; white-space: nowrap; float: none; direction: ltr; max-width: none; max-height: none; min-width: 0; min-height: 0; border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 1px 0}

One <em>is</em> less than or equal to two, two <em>is</em> less than or equal to three, etc. (Examples of total orders are probably easier to think of than partial orders, but, as we'll see later, partial orders are sufficient to do the things we really care about having orders for, without needing to go so far as to necessitate that the order be total. I.e., partial orders let us assume less to get the same basic outcome for what we'll be doing later.)</p><p>Posets are really important for a couple of reasons. The main one is that posets are the <em>simplest interesting kind of category</em>. Posets are <em>interesting</em> because they <em>can</em> have morphisms between different objects, and morphisms are where all the interesting stuff in a category lie, as we'll see in a couple of posts. However, because there is at most one morphism between any two objects in a poset, posets stay fairly tame and simple. If you're ever confused by a concept in category theory, it's pretty much always a good idea to apply it to a poset so that you can see the idea in its simplest interesting form.</p><p>We'll also see that posets are very useful for studying what it means to do things in the <em>best possible way</em>—which is what adjunction, arguably the key concept of category theory, is all about. </p><p>***</p><p>One of the nice things about categories is how easily visualized their underlying structure is. For example, take a poset like <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""1 \to 2 \to 3""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mn""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">1</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">→</span></span><span class=""mjx-mn MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">2</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">→</span></span><span class=""mjx-mn MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">3</span></span></span></span></span></span> and another poset like <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""a \to b \to c""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">a</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">→</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">b</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">→</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">c</span></span></span></span></span></span>. These are clearly very similar posets. (In fact, they're isomorphic.) </p><p>Despite the superficial differences, we clearly have ""basically the same thing"" going on with these two categories. So let's get abstract (which is what category theory is all about). Look at this category: </p><div><span class=""mjx-chtml MJXc-display"" style=""text-align: center;""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\bullet \to \bullet \to \bullet.""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.151em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">∙</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">→</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.151em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">∙</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">→</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.151em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">∙</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""margin-top: -0.144em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">.</span></span></span></span></span></div><p>We've gotten rid of the labels on the objects and just replaced them with generic nodes.

For example, the basic definition of a natural transformation has at its center a commutative square—and properly defining natural transformations was the original motivation for developing category theory! (We'll talk about natural transformations quite a bit later.)</p><p>From here we can branch out in lots of different ways in terms of adding morphisms and objects, but you should get the general idea. Whenever you can think of a model that can be boiled down to nodes and arrows, it's probably a category. You should know that categories like <a href=""https://imgur.com/a/zxoFNGc"">the two categories depicted here</a> are totally valid. You can have an infinite number of morphisms between two objects going back and forth. In the end, as long as the morphisms compose (associatively), you can do pretty much anything you want. We'll get a clearer view of exactly how to talk about this once we've discussed sets and functions in the next post.</p>",countedblessings,countedblessings,countedblessings,

I'm excited because I believe this approach better describes a wide range of human behavior, including subjective mental experiences, than any other theory of how the mind works, it's compatible with many other theories of brain and mind, and it may give us an adequate way to ground human values precisely enough to be useful in AI alignment.</p><h1>A predictive coding theory of human values</h1><p>My general theory of how to ground human values in minimization of prediction error is simple and straightforward:</p><ul><li>Neurons <a href=""https://www.mindcoolness.com/blog/bayesian-brain-predictive-processing/"">form</a> <a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/06/book-review-behavior-the-control-of-perception/"">hierarchical control systems</a>.</li><ul><li>cf. a grounding of <a href=""https://mapandterritory.org/form-and-feedback-in-phenomenology-d44f4e5c72b3"">phenomenological idealism using control systems</a>, and <a href=""https://mapandterritory.org/introduction-to-noematology-fac7ae7d805d"">its implications</a></li><li>cf. <a href=""https://mapandterritory.org/unstaging-developmental-psychology-fcdc5f9ba894"">the hierarchy is recursive</a> and <a href=""https://mapandterritory.org/phenomenological-complexity-classes-8b41836437b9"">reasserts itself at higher levels of organization</a></li></ul><li>Those control systems aim to <a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/03/04/god-help-us-lets-try-to-understand-friston-on-free-energy/"">minimize prediction error</a> via negative feedback (homeostatic) loops.</li><li>The positive signal of the control system <a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/03/20/translating-predictive-coding-into-perceptual-control/"">occurs when prediction error is minimized</a>; the negative signal of the control system occurs when prediction error is maximized.</li><ul><li>There is also a neutral signal when there is insufficient information to activate the positive or negative signal ""circuitry"".</li><li>cf. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedan%C4%81"">feeling/sensation</a> is when the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prat%C4%ABtyasamutp%C4%81da#Twelve-fold_chain"">mind</a> makes a determination about <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spar%C5%9Ba"">sense data</a>, and sensations are positive, negative, or neutral</li></ul><li>""Good"", ""bad"", and ""neutral"" are then terms given to describe the experience of these positive, negative, and neutral control signals, respectively, as they move up the hierarchy.</li></ul><p>I've thought about this for a while so I have a fairly robust sense in my mind of how this works that allows me to verify it against a wide variety of situations, but I doubt I've conveyed that to you already. I think it will help if I give some examples of what this theory predicts happens in various situations that accounts for the behavior people observe and report in themselves and others.</p><ul><li>Mixed emotions/feelings are the result of a literal mix of different control systems under the same hierarchy receiving positive and negative signals as a result of producing less or more prediction error.</li><li>Hard-to-predict people are perceived as creepy or, stated with less nuance, bad.</li><li>Familiar things feel good by definition: they are easy to predict.</li><ul><li>Similarly, there's a feeling of loss (bad) when familiar things change.</li></ul><li>Mental illnesses result from failures of neurons to set good/bad thresholds appropriately, to update set points at an appropriate rate to match current rather than old circumstances, and from sensory input issues causing either prediction error or internally correct predictions that are poorly correlated with reality (this broadly including issues related both to sight, sound, smell, taste, touch and to mental inputs from long term memory, short term memory, and otherwise from other neurons).</li><li>Desire and aversion are what it feels like to notice prediction error is high and for the brain to take actions it predicts will lower it either by something happening (seeing sensory input) or not happening (not seeing sensory input), respectively.</li><li>Good and bad feel like natural categories because they are, but ones that are the result of a brain interacting with the world rather than features of the externally observed world.</li><li>Etc.</li></ul><p>Further exploration of these kinds of cases will help in verifying the theory via whether or not adequate and straightforward applications of the theory can explain various phenomena (I view it as being in a similar epistemic state to evolutionary psychology, including the threat of misleading ourselves with just-so stories). It does to some extent hinge on questions I'm not situated to evaluate experimentally myself, especially whether or not the brain actually implements hierarchical control systems of the type described, but I'm willing to move forward because even if the brain is not literally made of hierarchical control systems the theory appears to model what the brain does well enough that whatever theory replaces it will also have to be compatible with many of its predictions. Hence I think we can use it as a provisional grounding even as we keep an eye out for ways in which it may turn out to be an abstraction that we will have to reconsider in the light of future evidence, and that work we do based off of it will be amendable to translation to whatever new, more fundamental grounding we may discover in the future.</p><h1>Relation to AI alignment</h1><p>So that's the theory. How does it relate to AI alignment?</p><p>First note that this theory is naturally a foundation of axiology, or the study of values, and by extension a foundation for the study of ethics, to the extent that ethics is about reasoning about how agents, each with their own (possibly identical) values, interact. This is relevant <a href=""https://mapandterritory.org/towards-an-axiological-approach-to-ai-alignment-4993d044d1b8"">for reasons I</a> and <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/zvrZi95EHqJPxdgps/why-we-need-a-theory-of-human-values"">more recently Stuart Armstrong</a> have explored:</p><ul><li>What it would mean for an AI to be aligned is currently only defined in natural language. We don't know how to make a <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7dvDgqvqqziSKweRs/formally-stating-the-ai-alignment-problem"">precise specification of what AI alignment means</a> without presupposing a solution that makes <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.09836"">many assumptions</a>.</li><li>Since alignment is alignment with human values, <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/TR3eqQ2fnfKWzxxHL/research-agenda-in-reverse-what-would-a-solution-look-like#NdfJ8Yo9atL6mB6cW"">we must understand human values well enough that we can adequately ground the definitions</a> so they don't <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/dC7mP5nSwvpL65Qu5/why-the-tails-come-apart"">come</a> <a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/09/25/the-tails-coming-apart-as-metaphor-for-life/"">apart</a> under <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NqQxTn5MKEYhSnbuB/goodhart-s-curse-and-limitations-on-ai-alignment"">optimization</a> and we can verify whether or not we have achieved alignment via understanding we have that is not given to us by AI and thus suspect in the case that we failed to achieve alignment.</li><li>Further, since we can neither resolve value conflicts nor even <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05812"">learn human values without making normative assumptions</a>, however weak they may be, we would do well to find assumptions that are rooted in things that are unlikely to create x-risks/s-risks because they are strongly correlated with what we observe at the most basic physical level and are unlikely to be the result of perceptual biases (anthropic bias, cultural bias, etc.) that may lock us into outcomes we would, under reflection, disprefer.</li></ul><p><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CSEdLLEkap2pubjof/research-agenda-v0-9-synthesising-a-human-s-preferences-into-1"">Stuart has been exploring</a> one approach by grounding human values in an improvement on the abstraction for human values used in inverse reinforcement learning that I think of as a behavioral economics theory of human values. My main objection to this approach is that it is behaviorist: it appears to me to be grounded in what can be observed from external human behavior by other agents and has to infer the internal states of agents across a large inferential gap, true values being a kind of hidden and encapsulated variable an agent learns about via observed behavior. To be fair this has proven an extremely useful approach over the past 100 years or so in a variety of fields, but it also suffers an epistemic problem in that it requires lots of inference to determine values, and I believe this makes it a poor choice given the magnitude of Goodharting effects we expect to be at risk from with superintelligence-levels of optimization.</p><p>In comparison, I view a predictive-coding-like theory of human values as offering a much better method of grounding human preferences. It is</p><ul><li><strong>parsimonious</strong>: the behavioral economics approach to human values allows comparatively complicated value specifications and requires many modifications to make it reflect a wide variety of observed human behavior, whereas this theory lets them be specified in simple terms that become complex by recursive application of the same basic mechanism;</li><li><strong>requires little inference</strong>: if it is totally right, only the inference of measuring neuron activity creates room for epistemic error within the model;</li><li><strong>captures internal state</strong>: true values/internal state is assessed as directly as possible rather than inferred from behavior;</li><li><strong>broad</strong>: works for both rational and non-rational agents without modification;</li><li><strong>flexible</strong>: even if the control theory model is wrong, the general ""<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_approaches_to_brain_function"">Bayesian brain</a>"" approach is probably right enough for us to make useful progress over what is possible with a behaviorist approach such that we could translate work that assumes predictive coding to another, better model.</li></ul><p>Thus I am quite excited about the possibility that predictive coding approach may allow us to ground human values precisely enough to enable successfully aligning AI with human values.</p><hr class=""dividerBlock""><p>This is a first attempt to explain what has been my ""big idea"" for the last year or so now that it has finally come together enough in my head that I'm confident presenting it, so I very much welcome feedback, questions, and comments that may help us move towards a more complete evaluation and exploration of this idea.</p>",gworley,gordon-seidoh-worley,Gordon Seidoh Worley,

maintenance.  After twice now forgetting I was hosting dinner in the
few days between RSVPing ""yes"" and people showing up at my house,
however, I realized it needed to be sending reminder emails day-of.  I
<a href=""https://github.com/jeffkaufman/standing-event/commit/7d2f077a00eed5f6452ee93930ba7bf5dffe6a36"">added

They only go to people who RSVP'd yes; they're a reminder to come not
a reminder to RSVP.

If you have an event you'd like to set up with it, feel free!  Let me

A big part of me.</p><p>The way I'm thinking about it, there are two reasons to continue working on this:</p><p>1. <strong>Swinging for a home run</strong>. If there's a chance for high upside. If not, there are other ideas I could be working on that do provide the upside I'm looking for.</p><p>2. <strong>Swinging for a single. </strong>If there's a high likelihood of making a few hundred thousand dollars. Something comparable to what I'd make working as a programmer.</p><h1>Swinging for a home run</h1><p>Throughout the time I was working on Premium Poker Tools, I had been assuming that the market was big enough to provide high upside. Eg. I thought that 100k users and $100/user was very possible.</p><ul><li>In being amongst the poker community, you get the impression that Flopzilla (market leading competitor) is ubiquitous. Everyone knows what it is. Everyone has it. Everyone needs it.</li><li>The poker subreddit has over 100k subscribers. Educational YouTube videos get over 100k views. Some posts on TwoPlusTwo have over 1M views. The type of person to watch an educational YouTube video on poker is serious enough to want to have Flopzilla or a similar app, you would think. So maybe there are a few hundred thousand of these people in the world, and maybe I can capture 100k of them.</li><li>On top of that, poker seems to be a game that is growing. And imagine if it is legalized in more states?</li><li>At $100, the app pays for itself. And poker players are the type to understand +ROI decisions, you would think.</li><li>Poker players tend to be on the wealthy side. Older people with money. Younger people in high paying fields like tech. Younger people who are playing professionally. Well, most of them aren't actually wealthy, but it's especially important for them to invest in tools.</li><li>Maybe there's potential to be making hundreds of dollars per user. After all, that's still +ROI for a lot of people.</li></ul><p>But more recently, I've come to believe that that all just isn't true.</p><ul><li>One reliable source said he'd estimate that the market leader, Flopzilla, has between 1,000 and 10,000 users. And they charge $25-35. Which would imply an upper extreme of just $300k or so. Before marketing costs.</li><li>Four other people in the industry I've spoken with all say the same thing, although they didn't want to get into specific numbers.</li><li>Looking at Flopzilla and the other competitors, they're mostly one man shows that are lacking in terms of design and business stuff. If the market were bigger and they were making millions of dollars, I'd expect them to have a team and for things to appear more professional.</li><li>It's becoming more and more clear to me that very few poker players actually sit down and study. And that's what my app is for: to help you when you sit down and study. People want to passively watch YouTube videos and be told what to do. Poker coaches talk all the time about how students who are paying them a lot of money are too lazy to do the homework they were assigned.</li><li>It's also becoming clear to me that poker players aren't these rational purchasers that I envisioned. They're not quick to open their wallets, and often don't think about whether or not it pays for itself.</li></ul><p>Even if the industry people I've spoke with are wrong about the market being eg. 10k users, I'd need them to be <em>way</em> off. Suppose I make $25/user after marketing costs. That would mean I'd need 400k users to get to $10M. Since I can't expect 100% market share, I'd really need the market to be something like 1M people, and that is a very long ways from the 10k upper extreme that people are telling me. Maybe the real market is 50k instead of 10k, but not 1M instead of 10k.</p><h1>Swinging for a single</h1><p>If I do decide to quit working on Premium Poker Tools, my next step would be to take some time to work as a programmer and save up money before moving on to my next startup. But if I am close to the point of making a few hundred thousand dollars or something, then I may as well just keep working on PPT instead.</p><p>I just don't think the chances are high enough that I'll get to first base, so to speak.</p><p>Zooming out, I've been working on this app for 2 years and 3 months and only have two paid users.</p><p>Furthermore, I've sort of exhausted a lot of the customer acquisition channels. Affiliate partnerships, paid advertising, YouTube, Twitter, blog, in person networking, offering it for free, participating in poker forums, refer a friend, offering to coach/study with people: none of it has worked.</p><p>So looking at it from that perspective, it would be crazy to say, ""The upside to make millions might not be there, but I'm on the verge of making a few hundred thousand, so I should see this through.""</p><p>Also, it's worth noting that throughout these past two plus years, I've <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/QGRj2PGiK5eawgQN2/reflections-on-premium-poker-tools-part-1-my-journey"">continually</a> thought to myself, ""I'm just a month or two away"". I clearly have a bias, and I need to adjust in the opposite direction.</p><h1>What if</h1><p>Like I was saying at the beginning: this should be an easy decision. The reason to work on this is if it has a big upside, or if I'm on the verge of ""hitting a single"". Neither of those things seem close to being true, so I should quit. That's all there is to it.</p><p>I've went through this conversation with myself many times, and something just felt off. I was telling myself that the answer is obvious, but I still felt very hesitant to move forward with the decision to quit. It didn't feel right.</p><p>Eventually I noticed what was holding me back: ""what if"". What if I'm wrong and there actually is a big market? What if I really am just a month or two away from hitting a single?</p><p>The correct response to that is to note that you can never be 100% certain of anything, and just because there's some small chance I'm wrong doesn't mean I should keep working on this. You just have to make the best decisions you can given your uncertainty, not wait endlessly until you are certain.</p><p>Of course. I know this. My Monkey Brain even knows this. It's something I've always been pretty good with. Let me try to do a better job explaining what has held me up. Imagine the following:</p><blockquote>I quit Premium Poker Tools, and proceed to do my thing working as a programer. Nine months later, I see a new poker app take off and make millions of dollars. I think, ""What the hell! How did this happen!"" I start looking into it. I find some financial website that shows Flopzilla making millions of dollars a year. I talk to some people who say, ""Oh yeah, the market is huge.""</blockquote><p>I'll tell you why this would be boundlessly frustrating to me. Because if I had just taken the time to do this research <em>before</em> quitting PPT, <em>I </em>could have been the one who succeeded. Because a <em>trivial inconvenience</em> is the thing that got in my way. I expect better of myself. If that happened, I'd be extremely disappointed in myself.</p><p>I know I'm not perfect and there are things I'll miss. I just don't want to get caught in the above scenario where there are <em>obvious</em> things that I miss. Because of <em>laziness.</em></p><p>So then, the solution is pretty simple right? Just take the time right now to investigate all of these things and make sure I don't fall victim to trivial inconveniences. But somehow, that solution just doesn't seem to be working for me. I just keep worrying that there are <em>other</em> things I'm missing. That there are <em>more</em> trivial inconveniences that I should look out for that I just don't want to because I'm lazy. I know that sounds weird; it's a hard feeling to explain.</p><p>I feel tempted to just move on despite the voices in my head saying ""this doesn't feel right"". But if I do that, I know I'll torture myself with ""what if"" questions.</p><p>Let's try writing about the ""what ifs"". Sorry if it gets too poker-specific.</p><ul><li><strong>What the people I spoke with are wrong and the market right now is actually really big? </strong>Even if that were true, it still seems unlikely that I'll succeed, given how little traction I've had. Anyway though, I feel confident that the market isn't big. What else can I do to increase this confidence? I could reach out to more people. I don't really want to do that though. I could learn more about researching your competitors. But I've done a bit of googling and it hasn't been too fruitful. One article said you can estimate based on the number of employees. I'm pretty sure they don't have employees, which would imply that the market is small.</li><li><strong>What if I'm just being impatient and need to spend more time building an audience? </strong>Well, even if that were true, it would only be for a slice of a ~$300k pie. The amount of work/time doesn't seem like it's worth it for a small reward, especially given that it could easily just flop and not get me any traction. Also, I really enjoy writing blog posts and making YouTube videos, and it's something that I can do in my spare time if I decide to quit.</li><li><strong>What if I'm just one affiliate away from making this a success? </strong>Flopzilla does affiliate stuff, even with some A-listers, and they still only have 1k-10k users. So, as tempting as it is to think otherwise, it's pretty unlikely that one affiliate does the trick for me. Even if it does and it snowballs into more and more affiliates, we're still talking about a roughly $300k pie, and working with affiliates means giving up 30-50% in revenue share.</li><li><strong>What if this new tool I want to build gets me over the hump?</strong> It's possible that it's a hit and it gets me, say, 2k users at $50/user or something. But that's not enough to justify continuing to work on this full time, given that it could also just flop. The upside would need to be like 10 or 20k users, and I really don't think it's that large. However, this tool I'm referring to is something that I plan on working on in my spare time regardless, and if it really takes off, I can always quit my job and pursue it if I feel it's appropriate.</li><li><strong>What if lowering the price and undercutting my competitors leads to a lot of traction? </strong>I highly doubt it. I had been offering it for <em>free</em> for a while, and it was only getting me like 100-200 users/month. I think it's more about exposure and having an audience than paying $20 instead of $25. But even if undercutting them is a success, how big a success are we talking? Maybe 5k users if I'm lucky. I can always try this in my spare time, and come back to Premium Poker Tools if it has a ton of traction all of a sudden.</li><li><strong>What if I can expand the size of the market by making it easy enough to uses for the masses? </strong>Right now, the masses are confused by and don't know how to use this sort of poker software. Even more serious players often fall into this bucket. It's always made me feel hopeful, because if I solve this problem, it could give me a big leg up. I have many ideas on how to do this. Some sort of workbook thing to go through. More handholding. A little gamification. But all of this would be a pretty big undertaking, and my intuition is that it wouldn't grow the market too significantly. And there's a lot of risk. It doesn't seem worth spending 6-12 months working on.</li><li><strong>What if I add stuff like spaced repetition to make studying more effective? </strong>I really don't see this being something that people will understand and value enough to pay a lot of money for. And I don't see it as something that will attract attention from the masses.</li><li><strong>What if I built something that helped you zoom out and find good exploitative spots? </strong>It'd be a big undertaking. Let's just say 6-12 months. It could easily just flop. That all makes it a bad candidate to ""swing for a single"" with. And, while <em>I </em>personally think it'd be awesome and that everyone else should agree with me and pay a lot of money for, I don't see it as having home run potential, unfortunately.

jPDSzqHJCz2drFKvA,Categories: models of models,categories-models-of-models,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/jPDSzqHJCz2drFKvA/categories-models-of-models,2019-10-09T02:45:29.617Z,52,31,18,False,False,,"<p>Let me clarify what I mean when I say that math consists of nouns and verbs. Think about elementary school mathematics like addition and subtraction. What you learn to do is take a bunch of nouns—1, 2, 3, etc.—and a bunch of verbs—addition, subtraction—and make sentences. “1 + 2 = 3.”</p><p>When you make a sentence like that, what you're doing is taking an object, 1, and observing how it changes when it interacts—specifically, adds—with another object, 2. You observe that becomes a 3. Just like how you can observe a person (object) bump their head (interaction) into a wall (other object) and the corresponding change (equals sign): the bluish bump emerging on their forehead.</p><p>Well, it turns out that no matter how far you go in math, you’re still taking objects and observing how they change when they interact with other objects. You learn about other kinds of numbers like 2.5 and 3.333 repeating, and other kinds of interactions like multiplication and division.</p><p>Eventually things start getting more abstract. You learn about matrices and the kinds of interactions they can have. You learn about sets and functions in a deep way. Complex numbers, topologies, etc. </p><p>But you never get away from nouns and verbs.</p><p>What are we going to do with all of these nouns and verbs? Well, at some point, when you have a bunch of things that feel similar in an important way, you often want to take a step back, lump all of the individual things together, and talk about them <em>in general</em>. Why do we have the concept of fruit? Because we live in a world where apples, oranges, lemons, papayas, etc., exist. </p><p>Why do we have the concept of numbers? Because we have a bunch of them, not just 1, 2, and 3, but also 2.5, 3.333 repeating, irrational numbers, and even complex numbers. Why do we have the concept of “operations?” Because we have addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Even though all of these give you very different answers for the same input of numbers, (1 + 2 does not equal 1 - 2 does not equal 1 times 2 does not equal 1 divided by 2), they still have something very similar in common, so it’s worth coming up with the concept of “operation” to study them independently of their individual characteristics. Just like how we can talk about “fruit” without having to reference the shape of an apple.</p><p>If you lived in a world with only apples, you wouldn’t have the concept of fruit. If you lived in a world where the only kind of thing was a rock, you wouldn’t have the concept of nouns. If you lived in a world where the only kind of math-thing was numbers, category theorists wouldn’t have come up with the concept of objects. (They wouldn't have come up with category theory at all!)</p><p>And what is the use of generalization? A bird’s-eye view of something lets you see things from new perspectives, potentially changing your concept of the thing entirely. When you think of numbers as various ways you can count stuff on your fingers, you can inch your way past the natural numbers to negatives, fractions and irrational numbers. But complex numbers will throw you for a total loop—they just don’t seem to be relatable to “amounts of things” in a way that you’re ever likely to see in the world.</p><p>In fact, complex numbers made no sense to me until I learned what numbers <em><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics)"">actually are</a></em>, at which point everything clicked into place. The generalization helped me understand the specific case—complex numbers are just another type of number, like how apples are just another type of fruit.</p><p><em>Generalization</em> <em>is helpful when life stops throwing convenient examples at you.</em></p><p>For example, say you want to grow new kinds of fruit that have never existed. Having a concept of fruit is <em>necessary</em> to conceiving of that idea. Life's not going to give you examples of fruit that have never existed! You have to explore the conceptual space of all fruit.</p><p>(In fact, this experience with complex numbers, years ago, probably inspired these posts. I got the idea that if you just bothered to take a <em>really long time</em> to explain the mathematics, the average person could probably grasp quantum physics. This series is the category-theory version of that original idea.)</p><p>Category theory exists for the same reason the concept of fruit does: there are lots of individual things that have certain commonalities that make generalization an appealing idea. Apples and oranges are very different on the surface and very similar deep down. Natural numbers and complex numbers are very different on the surface and very similar deep down. </p><p>Category theory goes one step wider. It emerges when people look at entire fields of math like “algebra” and “topology” and notices that, while they’re very different on the surface, they seem to be very similar deep down. Many other fields of mathematics seemed to also share these deep similarities, and so gradually they all became mere examples of the generalization, that generalization being a <em>category</em>. (A category being something we'll define by the end of this post.) Just like how apples and oranges become mere examples of the generalization that is “fruit.”</p><p>And one of those commonalities is that all of these superficially disparate fields of mathematics study <em>things</em> and <em>interactions between those things.</em> I.e., they study objects and morphisms.</p><p>That might sound really general. And it is! And yet, just like with the general definition of fields that lets us understand complex numbers, we can learn really interesting things from this super-general perspective. (Specifically, the Yoneda lemma and adjunction.)</p><p>But right now you are having to take my word for the idea that many different fields of math can be thought of as studying “nouns and verbs.” So let’s look at things from a different perspective.</p><p>Even if you don’t know higher maths, you probably know things like, “pouring milk in my cereal will make my cereal soggy.”</p><p>So “milk + cereal = soggy cereal.” Seems awfully...<em>mathematical</em>.</p><p>Why does math exist, anyway? Well, there’s lots of ways to answer that question, so let’s rephrase it: why do <em>mathematicians</em> exist? Or even better, why do mathematicians get <em>paid</em>? It certainly isn’t for the joy of doing math. Instead, “mathematician” is a job that you can actually get paid to do because math is very useful for modeling our reality.</p><p>So why does math boil down to objects and morphisms so often? Probably for the same reason English boils down to nouns and verbs: we use language to discuss reality, and reality seems to boil down to nouns and verbs.</p><p>Take birds, for example. They <em>are</em> birds, so they’re nouns (objects). And they do stuff like fly, tweet, lay eggs, eat, etc. I.e., verbs (morphisms).</p><p>Whatever you may or may not know of maths, you definitely know a thing or two about reality. You’ve been living in it your whole life.</p><p>The rest of this post will take common sense ideas about creating models of our reality, break them down into their most abstract components, and end up with some simple rules that any model should follow. We’ll discover that those components and rules are <em>exactly</em> the components and rules that define a category.</p><p>***</p><p>You know a lot of models, even if most of them would never make it into a textbook. You use these models to navigate reality.</p><p>For example, a sentence like ""Alice pushes Bob"" is a model of reality. By themselves, those letters in that order are meaningless. But because you can use them to make predictions (specifically, you're inferring the speaker's state of mind), the sentence is correspondingly a model of (that particular part of) reality. </p><p>Sentences themselves exist, so we can model them too. You can think of a sentence structure as a way of modeling a sentence. As for models themselves, a model is a way of abstracting away from some details of whatever you're studying so that other features become more salient. For example, you can model a specific cat, Mr. Peanuts, as just a cat, neglecting specific features like his name, his color, etc., so that other, more general features of cats, like the tendency to meow, eat tuna fish, and utterly despise humans become more salient.</p><p>That is to say, what will Mr. Peanuts do in [specific situation]? Hard to say unless you know him personally. But if we ask, ""What will <em>a cat</em> do in [specific situation]?"" you might have a decent guess. The cat's not going to start barking, for one. </p><p>You have a model of cats inside your head, and this lets you make predictions, at the expense of specificity. </p><p>Sentence structure models specific sentences like ""Alice pushes Bob"" in terms of their abstract components: ""Noun verbs noun.""</p><p>You might be surprised to learn that you can make predictions with sentence structure. For example, one of the rules of grammar is that a prepositional phrase ends with a noun. So let's say I ask you, ""Who will the soccer player kick the ball to?"" You don't know the answer—I haven't even given you a list of people to choose from.</p><p>Let's also say that you don't know what the word ""who"" means, so you don't even know what I'm asking. In fact, let's say you don't know what <em>any</em> of the words in the sentence means, only their parts of speech. You certainly aren't going to give the specific answer I'm looking for.</p><p>But you do know sentence structure! You know that ""to"" is a preposition, so the phrase it opens up must end with a noun.</p><p>So who is the soccer player going to kick the ball to? Answer: a person, place, or thing—a noun.</p><p>This is not a brilliant answer. But it <em>is</em> an answer—a correct one, in fact! This super abstract model of sentences let you figure things out even when you didn't know what any of the specific words meant.</p><p>So sentences are models, and sentence structure is a model of a model, and models are really useful: they let you predict things.</p><p>But sentence structure is a model of just one kind of model—sentences themselves. What if we wanted a model of all kinds of different models—sentences, sentence structure, scientific models, models from sensory data, mathematical models, everything? What if we wanted to model <em>modeling itself</em>?</p><p>Why, we'd turn to category theory.</p><p>So what are the <em>general qualities </em>of<em> all models</em>?</p><p>First of all, every model has things—<em>objects</em>—and actions that the objects to do other objects—<em>morphisms</em>. For example, you can model a person by seeing them. That is to say, you hit them with some photons and form a picture of them based on the result. Every model is ultimately found in how one object changes another object—hence the term ""<em>morph</em>ism.""</p><p>(Notice how sentences, which themselves boil down to nouns and verbs, can be thought of as models of anything. After all, it's hard to imagine any kind of phenomenon that can't be expressed in a sentence, even if you have to make up some new words to do it. Effectively, the reason we use category theory to form models of models of everything instead just sticking with English is because we can define our category as obeying certain rules or axioms that correspond to how models ought to work, while English can say pretty much anything. The rest of this post discusses these rules.)</p><p>So categories—models of models—consist of objects and morphisms. But what are the <em>rules</em> we require our objects and morphisms to obey so that they match up with our ideas of how models of reality ought to work? One is that every object ought to be, in some sense, a <em>perfect</em> model of <em>itself</em>. </p><p>Think about what models do: they transform how we view objects. If I tell you someone is a murderer, this changes how you view them because you apply a different model. Loosely, you could say that you apply the ""murderer"" morphism to the person in question. Well, every object ought to have a model that you can apply that doesn't transform the object at all—<em>not</em> because you aren't transforming, but because there's <em>no effect</em>, like multiplying by 1. For example, if you apply the ""Mr. Peanuts"" morphism to Mr. Peanuts, this shouldn't change anything: Mr. Peanuts is already Mr. Peanuts. This morphism is, in a certain clear sense, the <em>identity</em> of Mr. Peanuts.</p><p>So perhaps unsurprisingly, in category theory, we say that <em>every</em> object has an <em>identity morphism</em> that ""does nothing.""

I&apos;m at a point where things aren&apos;t looking so hot, and I need to sit down and do some hard thinking. What better way to do that then to write on LessWrong!</p><h1>Background</h1><p>To understand my journey with Premium Poker Tools, I think you have to first understand a little bit about me and what I&apos;m doing with my life. In short, I want to start startups, make a lot of money, and use the money to a) be financially independent, and b) do good for the world.</p><p>I spent about two years in college working on a startup that went nowhere. After that, I managed to get an entry level job as a web developer. I was a pretty bad at the time. I spent about 11 months at that job before getting fired. I quickly got another job, but got fired 5 months into that one. In both cases, it was a mix of a) me clearly not being a &quot;company guy&quot;, and instead wanting to be done at 5pm so I could go off and do what&apos;s best for me, b) clashes with authority figures, and c) being a slow programmer.</p><p>After the second job, I moved to Vegas to be with my now girlfriend. I had about $85,000 saved up in the bank, and my plan was the following: 1) get better at programming, 2) freelance a little and save up some more money, 3) start a startup. And then from there repeat steps 2 and 3 (and maybe 1) until I succeed with a startup. After that, the plan would be some mix of 1) figuring out how to use the money for good, 2) starting or investing in more startups, and 3) enjoying myself.</p><h1>Self-studying computer science</h1><p>I spent my first year in Vegas self-studying computer science. It was alright. Idk. I feel like I should have came away from that year making a lot more progress than I did, but at the same time, I did learn a lot.</p><p>In general, I&apos;ve always planned on living the digital nomad life. At least until I find a place I like enough to want to settle down in. But I&apos;m pretty sure that&apos;ll take some time, and that I&apos;ll end up spending time in a lot of different places. Anyway, I find myself living in Vegas. Poker is a thing in Vegas. I figure that I should spend some time on hobbies, and poker seems cool, so I feel like I should give poker a shot while I happen to be in Vegas. I won&apos;t have another opportunity like this. Or so my thought process was at the time.</p><p>So, during that first year, I spend some of my time learning and playing poker. I have a lot to say about poker. I think it&apos;s a great game for rationalists and people into challenging themselves and self-improvement. I&apos;ll have to write about that in another post some time.</p><p>As I learn about poker, I see these two apps come up over and over again: Flopzilla and Equilab. They&apos;re in books, and videos, and blog posts. People talk about them in poker forums. It seems like if you play poker, you really need to have these apps. They let you run simulations and see things like how often A3s beats JJ, and how often 76s flops a flush draw or straight draw. I really wanted to get these apps. But when I went to download them, I learned that you need a Windows OS, and I have a Mac. Damn! I was pretty bummed. Oh well.</p><p>I proceeded to dabble around in poker, progress <em>a lot</em> more slowly than I would have liked, and spend most of my time studying computer science. Life was fine.</p><h1>A small project to dust off the rust</h1><p>After about a year, I felt like it was time to move on. I was ready to freelance as a web developer. However, I had been doing computer-science-y things for a year and my web dev skills got pretty rusty, so I wanted to work on a project first to dust off that rust.</p><p>My skillset had been very JavaScript-centric, but I always thought the culture around Ruby was so cool, so I wanted to pursue that. But what project should I build? Hmmm. Oh! I know! I could build my own miniature version of Flopzilla and Equilab! It actually doesn&apos;t seem that hard! Seems like something I could do. And it seems like it&apos;d be a lot of fun. Plus, I could use it to study poker. Awesome!</p><p>And so, that&apos;s what I pursue.</p><p>I work on it. I&apos;m having a great time. Getting sucked in a little bit. I think it took about two months or so to have a decent version one. I wasn&apos;t really planning on spending that long on the project, but oh well, it&apos;s fine. I was <em>really</em> enjoying Ruby. So much nicer than JavaScript. I <em>love</em> how readable the code is.</p><p>Then... the planning fallacy happens. Over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over again. I think that pretty much sums up my next two years. In some sense at least.</p><h1>Really getting sucked in</h1><p>I think to myself, huh, this is pretty cool. I actually built a miniature version of these popular apps. I wonder if this could be a thing. I get pretty excited. I know a guy (well, really an acquaintance of an acquaintance) who played poker professionally. I get a hold of him and ask if he thinks this app I&apos;m building could be a thing. He says that Flopzilla and Equilab are definitely better, but that if this is <em>free</em>, well, idk, maybe it could be a thing.</p><p>Good enough for me! Woooooooo hoooooooooooo!!! Let&apos;s goooooooooooooo!!!</p><p>Says my Monkey Brain.</p><p>Rational Self? He says:</p><blockquote>Meh, idk if this is a good opportunity or not, but there&apos;s a couple more features I want to build that shouldn&apos;t take too long. Idk, maybe a month or two. Let&apos;s just give it a go. I&apos;m getting good experience, after all. And I feel like this could get some traction with a) Mac users and b) people who want something for free, at the very least. So yeah, let&apos;s just bang out these next couple of features and proceed from there.</blockquote><p>C&apos;mon Rational Self. Will you <em>ever</em> stop falling for the planning fallacy?</p><p>So yeah, at that point, I basically just get sucked in. I keep thinking, &quot;only another month or two&quot;. But things always end up taking longer.</p><p>At some point I deploy it so that it&apos;s live. When I test out the live version by running a simulation, I realize something: it&apos;s <em>slow</em>. Huh? Why is that? The development version has always been super fast. Why the discrepancy? Oh, I know: network latency! You see, I&apos;ve been using my new friend Ruby on Rails. Which runs on the <em>server</em>. So when you click &quot;Simulate&quot;, a request has to go out, over the internet, hit the server, run the simulations, then you have to wait for it to come all the way back to your laptop so that you can see the results. That back-and-forth from your laptop to the server takes time, and that time is why the live version appeared slow.</p><p>Fuck. That&apos;s just totally not acceptable, from a user experience perspective. <em>As if there are actually other users out there having experiences</em>. So what do I do? I just have to rewrite the whole thing to run on the client side. Remember how this was just supposed to be a little project to dust off my web dev rust?</p><p>I further justify the decision to rewrite it, because it&apos;d be an opportunity for me to learn React. Previously I was an Angular guy, but in my year away from web dev React and Vue and these one way data flow frameworks became a thing. Data binding is bad now, apparently. So like, my skillset is pretty outdated if I don&apos;t know these new frameworks, right? I should take the time to learn them, right? Learning is Good, right? And besides, it won&apos;t take that long to rewrite it. The actual logic is all there in Ruby already.</p><p>So, that&apos;s what I do. I rewrite the whole thing in React. I forget exactly how long it took, but it took some time.</p><p>Guess what happens next? I decide to rewrite the whole thing in <em>Vue!</em> I actually remember how this went down in pretty good detail. There was a point where I wanted to do the equivalent of <code>ng-repeat</code> in React. I looked around, and couldn&apos;t find out how to do it. What?! That&apos;s such a basic thing. Why isn&apos;t there an easy way to do it. The React Way to do it just seemed really ugly. I was annoyed.</p><p>Then I ended up taking a trip to New York to visit my family. There was a day where I was in the city for a doctors appointment. I was getting a bagel in the morning. I remember this. I sat down to eat my bagel. I opened my phone and was browsing Hacker News. I came across a post comparing VueJS to the other frameworks. I sat there and read the post as I ate my bagel.</p><p>Monkey Brain: OMG. VUE IS AMAZING. YOU <em>HAVE</em> TO DROP EVERYTHING AND REWRITE THE WHOLE THING IN VUE.</p><p>Rational Self: Yeah, I mean I guess that&apos;s not a bad idea. Learning is Good, after all. I&apos;m not in a rush. Seems like a good thing to do.</p><p>And so, I rewrite the whole thing in Vue. I have to say, I do like Vue a lot.</p><p>Let me point something out though. At this point, I&apos;ve been working on this project for... I don&apos;t know, maybe 6 months or something? A lot longer than I had initially planned.</p><h1>Is this a real business?</h1><p>And as I work on it, slowly but surely the idea starts to marinate in my head that this could be <em>better</em> that Flopzilla and Equilab. That this could be a real <em>business</em>.</p><p>So yeah, I rebuild it in Vue. I&apos;m loving Vue. I&apos;m loving the app. I&apos;m thinking that I might be able to build something better than Flopzilla and Equilab. (Let&apos;s just say &quot;Flopzilla&quot; moving forward instead of &quot;Flopzilla and Equilab&quot;. Flopzilla is the more substantial of the two.)</p><p>My memory for this point in the journey is a little bit fuzzy. I remember there being a good deal of time where I was in this no mans land where I wasn&apos;t sure if I wanted to pursue this as a business, but I did want to build &quot;just one more feature&quot;. I basically just kept caving in and doing &quot;just one more feature&quot;, while slowly thinking more and more, &quot;Ok, I sorta think I could outdo Flopzilla. I sorta think this could be a business.&quot;</p><p>At this time, I told myself that it&apos;s actually pretty low risk. Well, what I mean to say is that it&apos;s a pretty high-floor sort of pursuit. Like, I&apos;m not sure if I could outdo Flopzilla, but I&apos;m pretty sure I could get somewhere in the <em>ballpark</em>. Yeah, I felt pretty sure of that. And Flopzilla doesn&apos;t even work on Macs. And it costs $30. Mine <em>does</em> work on Macs, and I could make it <em>free</em>. So... worst case scenario I should be able to get a bunch of Mac users and people who want something for free. I know ads are tough. I&apos;m not saying I could get rich off of a free app, but I should be able to get a lot of users, and it should do <em>something</em> for me. It should be a pretty high-floor sort of pursuit. It&apos;s hard to see it just totally being a flop if I make it available for free. And it&apos;ll only take another couple months. And who knows. Maybe it ends up being really awesome and I can charge for it and make good money!</p><p>So, I decide to pursue it. Well, I don&apos;t think &quot;pursue&quot; is the right word. For a long time, my thinking was, &quot;I&apos;m not sure if this is worth pursuing <em>long</em> term, but I do think it&apos;s worth spending the next few months building out a few more features, so let&apos;s just do that for now.&quot; Let me emphasize that. Even like a year into this project, it wasn&apos;t something that I actually.... in my mind... explicitly... <em>decided</em> to pursue long term. I just kept saying &quot;another month or two, another month or two&quot;. And yet it had been like a year. I spent a <em>year</em> doing something I never actually <em>decided</em> to do, in some sense. </p><p>But after a full year, I didn&apos;t really have much to show for. That really started to get to me and make me anxious. &quot;How did this happen? How did I end up spending a year on something without ever deciding to do so?&quot;</p><p>To make it worse, it really conflicts with some part of my identity. I like to think of myself as &quot;good at startups&quot;. I failed with my first startup, and I always thought to myself that next time around, I will be smart and rational and consider lots of ideas and really think it through. I&apos;ll come up with some awesome plan for something that is very likely to succeed. Or at least that has a super high EV.</p><p>But where am I now? That is <em>totally</em> not how things went down with this app I&apos;m working on. There was no master plan at all. I just kept chugging along like some sort of semi-conscious monkey. &quot;Just another month or two. Just another month or two.&quot; Can&apos;t I open my eyes and think a little bit further down the line? Isn&apos;t imagining the future one of the things that makes humans human?</p><p>I know, I know. Humans are flawed and biased, and tons of people make these sorts of mistakes, and have these issues. But I expect better from myself. I <strong><em>know</em></strong> I can do better. Tsuyoku Naritai! I&apos;m better than this. This is not what I&apos;m capable of.</p><h1>Struggling and moving slowly</h1><p>But, I decide to chug along. Again, my memory feels pretty blurry. I forget exactly what my thought process was. I think it was that:</p><blockquote>If I could go back a year, maybe this isn&apos;t the most optimal thing to work on. But I have all of this code. And I have this roadmap of features that I really want to build. I think it&apos;s at least worth taking 6 months or so to see it through, given where I&apos;m at and how close I am.</blockquote><p>As you can probably tell, around this time I really start to struggle emotionally. I felt pressure to succeed and make all this time I spent worthwhile. At least worth something in the end. I want to have something to show for.</p><p>I have thoughts that I&apos;m 26 years old and I&apos;ve always imagined myself <em>way</em> further along than I am now.</p><p>And I have this little voice in my head saying:</p><blockquote>Hey Adam... it&apos;s been over a year... you don&apos;t have <em>any</em> users. This like totally goes against the whole lean startup thing, y&apos;know.</blockquote><p>And then I say in response:</p><blockquote>I know, I know! But I really question whether the lean startup applies to this <em>particular</em> scenario. I <em>know</em> you want to avoid wasting time building things that people don&apos;t actually want. That&apos;s like the biggest startup sin there is. I know. But like, what am I supposed to do?</blockquote><blockquote>My hypothesis is that once my app gets to the point where it&apos;s in the ballpark of Flopzilla or better, that people will want to use it. It takes time to get to that point. There isn&apos;t really a quick two week MVP I could build to test that hypothesis. I&apos;m already trying to avoid building non-essential features, and focus on getting to that point as quickly as possible. So what am I supposed to do?</blockquote><blockquote>If I released this and found that I had no users and no one wants this, what would that tell me? Just that people don&apos;t like <em>this</em> version of the app enough. Sure, ok. But the real question is whether they&apos;ll like the Ballpark Flopzilla version enough, or the Better Than Flopzillla version enough. My hypothesis is that they will, and releasing it now wouldn&apos;t invalidate that hypothesis. And I can&apos;t think of a way to test those hypotheses quickly. I think I just need to build it and see what happens.</blockquote><p>I&apos;m going to resist the temptation to respond to this right now. Right now I just want to tell the story. The story as it <em>actually</em> happened. But I do want to say that there were a lot of voices swimming around in my head questioning what I was doing.</p><p>Oh, one more thing. Throughout this time I&apos;m also studying poker a little bit and trying to get good at it. It&apos;s going a lot more slowly than I wanted it to. I felt like an imposter not just as an entrepreneur, but as a poker player too.</p><p>I moved up the stakes online pretty slowly, but I was moving up. There was a point where I was stuck at $0.05/$0.10, but I did get past it. One thing that really ate at me though is that over my lifetime, I was down money at live $1/2. Live $1/2 is supposed to be the fishiest, easiest game ever. People love to talk about how incredibly bad $1/2 players are. And I&apos;m <em>down</em> money in that game. And I&apos;ve spent over a year building a poker app. And I&apos;m supposed to be a smart person. Definitely surfaces feelings of being an imposter. At least for my Monkey Brain. Rational Self knew that it was just over a small sample size and I was in fact a profitable player at live $1/2. But it was still tough, and frustrating.</p><p>Such is life with poker though! That&apos;s part of what makes it such a great game! Go read some stories of the downswings that people go through.</p><p>Anyway, another big question that I debated with myself is whether or not to really release it and advertise it to the public. It had been over a year of development and I had a working, solid product, so when you zoom out, it seems pretty obvious that you should be getting it in front of as many users as possible. But... I didn&apos;t do that.</p><p>Here&apos;s why. I thought to myself, what exactly is the advantage of doing that? My big hypothesis is that Ballpark Flopzilla will succeed. I&apos;m not there yet. Definitely at least a few months away. Sure, it&apos;s still possible that I get some users now, but who cares? I&apos;ll still get them in a few months anyway. It&apos;s not like I&apos;d be losing them if I wait a few months.</p><p>Also, people like to say that the benefit to having users is that you can learn from them. But like, do I really need to release to the public for that? Aren&apos;t there other means to that end? Can&apos;t I just do traditional UX user research? Yeah, I think I can. Or so my previous self thought.</p><p>And so that&apos;s what I did. I tried to find people to sit with and go through the app with. I offered to buy lunch for anyone willing to do this with me, and tried to spread the word via online forums. Once in a while I&apos;d find someone to do this with me, but to my surprise, not many people did. Weird.</p><p>Ok, but what&apos;s the <em>downside</em>, to releasing now, you ask? Well, I was very neurotic about bugs. I imagine the following thing happening: </p><p>I release some sort of beta version; people use it, they like it; but then someone realizes that my numbers are wrong. &quot;It should be 81%, not 68%.&quot; They trash me in the poker forums; word gets out; I develop a bad reputation, people need to trust that the numbers I give them are right, <em>that&apos;s absolutely essential!</em></p><p>So yeah, I really don&apos;t want that scenario happening. The risk of it happening seemed larger to me than the upside of getting a few users a few months earlier than I otherwise would.</p><p>And I&apos;d always be telling myself: I&apos;m not in a rush. So what if things take a little bit longer.</p><p>Lol! My Monkey Brain would be <em>screaming</em> at me that it needs some sort of validation. But then my Rational Self would say:</p><blockquote>No, no, that&apos;s just an irrational feeling that I&apos;m struggling to mitigate. We know it&apos;s silliness. Let&apos;s just ignore it.</blockquote><h1>Validation!</h1><p>Eventually, I did some tiny releases. And my Monkey Brain got some of that validation that it so desperately craved.</p><p>The big thing was posting to Reddit. I also posted to this popular poker forum called TwoPlusTwo, but I didn&apos;t get any responses there. But on Reddit, a lot of people told me the app was awesome, better than Flopzilla, etc, and thanked me for building it. I&apos;d get a couple random emails from people telling this to me and thanking me. <em>Man</em> did this feel good. I really, really needed it.</p><p>Here&apos;s another high point. Maybe the biggest high point in my whole journey. This one I remember exactly where I was and how it went down.</p><p>My girlfriend had some friends over, and she likes to play loud music and have fun. Y&apos;know, like normal people. I don&apos;t like that kind of stuff though. So I walked over to this awesome little hole in the wall place called Apache Taco Shop, hung out there, had a churro, and played some online poker.</p><p>I get bored when I play and pulled up YouTube to watch some poker videos in parallel to my playing. I know I shouldn&apos;t multitask like this, but I do it anyway. One of the videos was by a guy named Daniel Negreanu. He might be the most well known poker player in the world. People used to talk about him being one of the best in the world. Nowadays there&apos;s a cohort of younger more math-y people who are said to be better than Negreanu and his generation of players. But like, Negreanu is still fucking good.</p><p>I had like four tables open, I think. I have five windows on my screen. The left third is a YouTube video I have running. The right two thirds has four tables in a grid. Hands are popping in and out. Decisions to be made. My attention would drift to the YouTube video during the down moments in poker.</p><p>But as I had <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riyI6kKBl4A&amp;t=255s"">this video</a> open, something caught my eye. In poker there&apos;s this thing called a hand matrix. It looks like this:</p><span><figure><img src=""https://us.v-cdn.net/6026270/uploads/editor/my/7az6yfd985ob.png"" class=""draft-image "" style=""width:40%""></figure></span><p>Normally in these sorts of videos the hand matrix comes from Flopzilla or Equilab. Sometimes it comes from some other random app. But this hand matrix was different.</p><p>It sorta looks like it&apos;s from <em>my</em> app. Premium Poker Tools. Could it be???????? NO WAY! I have Google Analytics and only get like 100 visitors a month. I only did a few small releases to Reddit. There&apos;s no way <em>Daniel Negreanu</em> is using my app and putting it in his poker videos!</p><p>But he did! It <em>was</em> my app! No doubt about it.</p><p>I swear, I almost cried. I was so happy.</p><p>I called my girlfriend, told her, and ran home like a little baby.</p><p>I mean, this was big news (or so I thought at the time). He&apos;s one of the best players in the world. And a huge name. So, if he&apos;s using my app, I think I have to assume that it&apos;s good! If anyone has good taste it should be him. This is pretty strong evidence! Think about it. Imagine a world where Daniel Negreanu likes my app, but everyone else doesn&apos;t. That really doesn&apos;t make sense. If anything, there&apos;s going to be <em>some</em> niche of people who really like it. So yeah, this made me feel very confident that I had something legitimate on my hands here. That I wasn&apos;t crazy.</p><p>And the thing is, there&apos;s still so much room for improvement! I had so many ideas and features I wanted to pursue. If he likes it now, just wait until I make it even better! This has got to have a really high ceiling!</p><p>So, at this point, I&apos;m all in with the app. I&apos;ve finally decided that it&apos;s what I&apos;m going to pursue long(ish) term. I forget exactly when my mind really was on board with that idea. I think it happened before the Negreanu thing, but by the time the Negreanu thing happened, my mind was definitely on board.</p><h1>Finally starting to charge</h1><p>At some point, I decide to finally start charging for the app, and start trying to actually get users. Until now, I just posted to Reddit a few times with updates, and the app was free.</p><p>There was one Reddit <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/axfekk/updates_to_premium_poker_tools/"">post</a> in particular that inspired me to move forward. People were saying that it&apos;s kinda crazy that my app is available for free and isn&apos;t more popular. A few said that it&apos;s something that they would pay for. One person (in an earlier post actually) even <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/a1n819/free_app_similar_to_flopzilla_and_equilab/earsf9g?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x"">asked</a> how he could donate money. I replied with my PayPal info. Then a <em>different</em> person donated $10. (A little weird that the original person didn&apos;t, but whatever.)</p><p>That $10 I received, it was the first money I had made as an entrepreneur, and that&apos;s after three years of working on things (two on my first startup, and about one on this one). It felt good. But weirdly enough, it didn&apos;t feel as good as I thought it <em>should</em> feel, if that makes sense. And that thought made me feel a little weird, a little guilty.</p><p>Whatever though. Overall, I was pretty happy. Things were looking pretty good. People were saying that they love my app and would pay for it. And that&apos;s with the app at its current point. In six, twelve, eighteen months, it should be <em>way</em> better. And the competition seems like they aren&apos;t actively developing things anymore. So it seems like I should be able to outdo them and get a pretty big piece of the pie.</p><p>So, I proceed to finish up a few features, and then get to working on building user accounts and credit card processing stuff. Seems like something that is very standard, and should be a piece of cake for a good web developer, which I like to think of myself as. But it ended up being a big rabbit hole for me. I could have built a working version in a week or so maybe, but I wanted to do it right. I wanted to get security right, UX right, and just in general make sure I&apos;m following most of the best practices. I never know how to explain why code takes longer than it &quot;should&quot;, but I think this process ended up taking me at least a month, maybe longer. The fact that it took so long made me feel a little bit of imposter syndrome. Although when I came across <a href=""https://www.rdegges.com/2017/authentication-still-sucks/"">Authentication Still Sucks</a>, it mitigated a lot of that feeling actually. At the end of the day, I was pretty happy with the final result.</p><p>Then there were some other <a href=""https://www.indiehackers.com/post/ab8f7fa95e"">rabbit holes</a> I fell in to. Mostly consisting of business stuff. How do I want to monetize? Charging seems like it makes the most sense, but I should at least educate myself on what the other options are, and explore them a bit. I do that and decide to go with charging. But then there are a million other questions. Do I go monthly? Annually? Something else? Multiple options? Multiple tiers? $X.99 or $X.00? Stuff like that. I ended up spending some time doing research (hat tip to <a href=""https://www.priceintelligently.com"">Price Intelligently</a>), talking to people, and trying to make good decisions about all of this stuff. Maybe a week or so? I forget. I ended up deciding to charge $5.00/month.</p><p>Another small rabbit hole was looking at my options for credit card processing. I ended up going with Stripe, but I wanted to take some time to look at what the other options are, and what their costs and benefits are.</p><p>Eventually, I finish all of the grunt work of setting up the code for charging people. It happened at a good time for me. I finished about a day before I had a two week trip to visit some college friends and go to one of their weddings. It was a good stopping point for me code-wise, and a good time for me to take a little break.</p><h1>Optimism and pessimism</h1><p>After coming back from my trip and letting the dust settle a little bit, I found that some things went really well, and some things went really poorly.</p><p>I&apos;ll start with what went poorly: I wasn&apos;t getting any paid users. That was the big thing.</p><p>This guy from Reddit was my first user. I Skyped with him twice. He&apos;s a programmer + entrepreneur too, so we had some nice chats. He emailed me saying that he wants to subscribe as a paid user to support me, but also wanted to be upfront that he wouldn&apos;t have signed up if he didn&apos;t know me. But that&apos;s because he doesn&apos;t play poker enough. He does think the app is better than the competition.</p><p>Wonderful. Not exactly what I was looking for, but I&apos;ll take it!</p><p>My second user is a guy that I used to study poker with via Skype every week. But then one day, he just stopped responding to me. I&apos;d reach out every couple months, but he just wouldn&apos;t respond to me. Really weird. But yeah, he subscribed as a paid user.</p><p>Third guy is someone random. Fourth guy is an IRL friend who I offered it to for free, but insisted on paying.</p><p>So, all of that was nice, but it <em>doesn&apos;t exactly scream product-market fit</em>.</p><p>Then there&apos;s the sign-ups. I offered a 14-day free trial. I was getting about one sign-up per day. It&apos;s something, but again, not really screaming product-market fit.</p><p>So yeah, that was the bad news. Now for the good news.</p><p>The good news is that a) I&apos;d been getting good feedback on the app; people say it&apos;s really good, and b) I had a lot of affiliate leads. Let me explain what I mean by that.</p><p>When I first started charging, I considered doing affiliate marketing, where I give someone a link, and anyone who signs up via that link, they get some cut of the revenue, eg. 25-50%. So like if John Doe signs up with their link, and I&apos;m giving them 50% revenue share, since I&apos;m charging $5.00/month, I would give them $2.50/month for every month John Doe remains a user.</p><p>I initially decided to not do the affiliate stuff. I figured, why give up that 25-50% unnecessarily. Maybe the app takes off via word of mouth. I didn&apos;t actually <em>expect</em> that to happen, but I figured it was worth taking a stab. But after a month or so it became pretty clear that that wasn&apos;t going to happen, so I started to pursue affiliates.</p><p>I was doing pretty good! I got in touch with a bunch of people who said that they&apos;re interested. Many of them were authors of books that I&apos;ve read. That was really cool to me. Until that point, I thought of book authors as some sort of celebrity. Writing a book seemed like a big deal to me. And they were books that were relatively popular too. Now I don&apos;t feel that same awe for people who have written books.</p><p>Anyway though, that&apos;s the part that was going well. I wasn&apos;t getting paid users organically. I wasn&apos;t even getting non-paid users organically (throughout the time the app was free, I&apos;d only be getting like 200 users/month). But I was realizing how untrue &quot;build it and they&apos;ll come&quot; is, so it didn&apos;t worry me too much. In my mind, I had product validation. Enough people told me that the quality was really high. And my app&apos;s quality is only getting better, whereas the competition seemed stagnant. On top of that, I had all of these people saying that they were interested in working with me as an affiliate. People who were somebodies. Not really A-listers, but a solid mix of B-listers and C-listers. They seemed interested in working with me, and I felt pretty confident that once they start putting my app in their YouTube videos and blog posts, things would really ramp up for me.</p><h1>More optimism, more pessimism</h1><p>As time went on, the trends of the above section basically continued, but were amplified, I would say.</p><p>Time went on and I still had those same four users. And I&apos;d still be getting about one sign up/day. Actually, less. So that&apos;s the &quot;more pessimism&quot; part. Pretty bad that I&apos;m not growing or getting any traction.</p><p>The optimism part was that I had more people tell me they&apos;re interested in working with me as an affiliate. One was a legit A-lister. Let&apos;s talk about what happened with that.</p><h1>Red Chip</h1><p>I&apos;m just going to go ahead and use real names. Screw it.</p><p>During the World Series of Poker, I tried to get out there and meet people. I posted on a site called Red Chip Poker that I&apos;d love to meet up and hang out with anyone who&apos;s in town. No one responded, but one person invited me to a private poker game that they&apos;re having. So I went.</p><p>The game was super fun. <em>By far</em> the most challenging poker game I&apos;d ever played in.</p><p>I ended up having lunch with someone from the game. Partly just chatting, and partly looking for advice on my app. He was staying with a guy named Doug Hull, who&apos;s a cofounder at Red Chip, a pretty well known poker site that does videos, blog posts, forum, podcast, all of that stuff. He said I should get on their podcast.</p><p>My first reaction was that Red Chip is an A-lister, and I wasn&apos;t ready to deal with A-listers. That was in my future plans, but I felt like I was too small to make my play at them. But, y&apos;know what? Screw it. An opportunity is in front of me. Let&apos;s do it. I told him yes, and went with it. He introduced me to Doug, and a few weeks later Doug invited me over to his house to chat.</p><p>We chatted for like three hours. It was really nice for a lot of different reasons. One is just that there are only a handful of people in the world who build poker software, and he is one of them. So he understood things that no one else does, and it was nice to be understood in that sense.</p><p>I felt a little awkward about the fact that Doug has a product that is sort of a competitor to mine. But he seemed to not feel that way at all. I spent some time walking him through my app. We had a really great conversation. He gave me a ton of useful feedback and advice, and I explained the thought process behind a lot of my decisions. It didn&apos;t feel adversarial at all.</p><p>But it wasn&apos;t just feedback and advice. He wanted to work together.</p><p>An A-lister! Wants to work with me! I guess now is the right time after all.</p><p>What I was most interested in is something where they get me users for Premium Poker Tools. We talked about them putting a link on their site, promoting it, and getting some sort of revenue share.</p><p>He was also interested in that, but was more interested in me building other tools for Red Chip. He does his programming in MatLab, and doesn&apos;t know any web stuff. So he can build stuff, but isn&apos;t great with UI, and isn&apos;t able to publish it to the web. On the other hand, I do have those skills. So he was really excited. He had a lot of ideas that he wanted to work together on. It felt like he &quot;found his guy&quot;. We didn&apos;t get into the details too much, but it seemed like he wanted to co-own anything we built.</p><p>I thought a lot about how I want to proceed after this. I was a little star-struck to be honest, because they are A-listers in the poker world in my mind. But at the same time, I wasn&apos;t really feeling a lot of Doug&apos;s plans to co-own stuff.</p><p>1) I really prefer to work alone. I like the autonomy. I want to be able to make decisions as I see fit, and not have to justify it to someone else. In particular, I didn&apos;t want to justify myself to Doug. I respect his thoughts, but I think there are a lot of times when he doesn&apos;t see things the same way that I do. Here&apos;s an example. I have a regular 2d graph on my app. Y&apos;know, with x-y coordinates. When I showed it to him, he got excited and said that I should make it 3d or 4d, and how in his books he &quot;one upped&quot; me and has these 3d graphs. I <em>seriously</em> question whether users would be able to interpret those graphs and get value out of them, but Doug seemed to think it&apos;s just no big deal. Doug studied math in college and worked for Wolfram for a while, and seemed to not really understand how other people think. </p><p>2) I also felt like I didn&apos;t need him/them. All of the things he proposed are things that have been on my backlog. They&apos;re things I know how to build. I think the value he&apos;d be providing would be product guidance, and marketing/exposure. I don&apos;t think I need the product guidance. And as for exposure, I could get that with other affiliates. I had a lot of people saying they were interested in working with me as an affiliate, so that seemed like something I could do.</p><p>But despite these things, when you zoom out, it seems a little stupid for me to turn down an opportunity to work with them, given that they&apos;re A-listers and I&apos;m sitting here with no traction after almost two years. But that&apos;s what I decided I wanted to do. Because I trusted my zoomed in logic.</p><p>A couple days later, I had a Skype call with him and his partner James. It lasted a little bit over an hour. For the first half, I demoed the tools. James did most of the talking on this call, as opposed to Doug. He said he liked it! And he also had a bunch of useful feedback. The second half of the call, we talked more about business stuff and how to proceed. James was also interested in me building tools for Red Chip. He asked me how I felt about that. He threw out the idea of co-owning them. He also asked me how I felt about them sort of buying me out. Something along the lines of fixed price for PPT, and royalties + salary for future stuff. It was all very hand-wavy, but that was the gist.</p><p>I said no. I said I wanted to own anything I do and really pursue PPT. I told him how I had these huge visions (which I exaggerated a little bit to be sales-y). That I thought it could make many, many millions of dollars. Eg. maybe 100,000 users, and a $200 average LTV. He sort of laughed at that. Not in a mean way at all, but he just said that doesn&apos;t seem very likely, and that the poker market just isn&apos;t that big at all. That 1,000 users and a $50 average LTV is a lot more plausible.</p><p>I did update on this information, but not too much. It sounded like he was basing a lot of that on his numbers at Red Chip. But I saw the market for my app as way bigger. Just because <em>they</em> only have maybe 5k users doesn&apos;t mean that <em>I</em> am limited to that. In my mind, everyone needs software like mine to study with, whereas you don&apos;t really need to pay to be part of a training site. Reading books and consuming free content online like YouTube videos and blog posts will take you a <em>long</em> way. Yeah. IMO, those training sites really aren&apos;t necessary at all, given how much content is available for free/cheap. Also, I saw myself as capable of really skyrocketing past the competition and being the market leader, whereas there are a lot of poker training sites out there of similar quality to Red Chip. Which is to say there&apos;s a bigger market out there for me than for them. I didn&apos;t want to press him on this though. It didn&apos;t seem like it&apos;d lead the conversation in a good direction.</p><p>We finished up by talking about putting my app on Red Chip and doing the revenue share thing. He said they&apos;re interested in that. He said it&apos;d be nice if I could have Red Chip users get some sort of Red Chip-specific branding on the site. I don&apos;t love that idea, but I said sure. He ended by asking if I&apos;m open to having a different price. He said he thought $5/month is way too low and that you can&apos;t have a real business with that price. I said I&apos;m totally totally open to that, and that I am sort of winging it with price and I really respect their industry knowledge and yeah, that we can definitely talk more about that. So that&apos;s how we left it off, and we said we&apos;d talk again in a week or two.</p><p>I delayed a little bit though. For two reasons. 1) After getting feedback from Doug and James, there was so much I wanted to improve with the app before really putting it out there. 2) I wanted to figure out what a good revenue share amount would be. 25%? 50%? I needed time for a) reading and talking to people for advice, and b) to see if my other affiliate leads would materialize (starting to get concerned that they haven&apos;t yet), so that I have leverage (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_alternative_to_a_negotiated_agreement"">BATNA</a>) going into the conversation. 3) Another interesting opportunity popped up for me. I&apos;ll talk about that in the next section.</p><h1>Short deck</h1><p>I co-organize the Indie Hackers Las Vegas meetup. One of the guys at the meetup made an introduction for me to a guy named Brad. Brad is a former poker pro who is working on some poker security and crypto things now. We had lunch. It was... interesting.</p><p>For one, he said that he really doesn&apos;t like the market for the sort of app I&apos;m building. He said the market is pretty small. Same thing James said. He said that yes, there are millions of people who play poker, but that no one actually studies. Everyone likes to <em>say </em>that they study and sound smart and cool, but very few people actually do. And that poker players are cheap and don&apos;t want to fork over money. <em>And</em> that the type of app I have is outdated. Nowadays it&apos;s all about something called Game Theory Optimal plays, which basically is figuring out how you&apos;d play against a perfect opponent, such that you can&apos;t get exploited.</p><p>But I only updated my beliefs slightly from this conversation. I have to update somewhat, but the things he was saying just seemed wrong. Sure, there are a lot of people who are lazy and don&apos;t study, and there are people who don&apos;t want to fork over the money. But there are also people who do study and who are happy to fork over the money. The pie is really big with millions of players in the world, and I only need a slice of it.</p><p>I told him about my estimates. The poker subreddit has over 100k subscribers. A lot of educational YouTube videos get 100k+ views. A lot of the smaller channels get tens of thousands of views. All of these people are serious enough about poker where they are spending their free time trying to learn the game. To me, that is a potential customer. If you&apos;re spending your free time trying to learn the game, you should be in the market for poker software. All of the books and articles I read say that you need to have poker software like mine. Flopzilla is a household name. Everyone knows about it.</p><p>And as for poker players not being willing to spend money, that didn&apos;t seem true. Poker players often are people with money. There are a lot of wealthy recreational players. There&apos;s a lot of older ones who are retired and have some money. Younger players are often in tech fields, or playing poker professionally. And poker is <em>all about</em> ROI. And apps like mine <em>easily</em> pay for themselves. So I would think that poker players wouldn&apos;t hesitate to invest in something with a positive ROI. I mean, not everyone, but again, the pie is big, so even if a minority do, that&apos;s still awesome.</p><p>And the idea that poker is all GTO now is an idea I&apos;m pretty familiar with. Some people think this way. They&apos;re wrong. But more to the point, it&apos;s definitely not the case that everyone thinks this way. Especially small-to-medium stakes players. Most of them don&apos;t think that way.</p><p>So, for all of those reasons, I didn&apos;t update too hard off of his skepticism.</p><p>Anyway, that wasn&apos;t really what he was there to talk about. He wanted something from me.</p><p>There&apos;s a version of Texas Hold&apos;em (what people usually mean when they say &quot;poker&quot;) called Short Deck Texas Hold&apos;em. Basically, you remove the cards 5, 4, 3 and 2 from the deck, and now flushes beat full houses. Brad plays high stakes short deck professionally. He says that everyone is good at regular poker (long deck), but people are still learning short deck, so there are (more) fish to make money from.</p><p>More to the point, there isn&apos;t any publicly available software for short deck. He said he&apos;s positive that some of the super high stakes guys hire people privately to build them software, but there isn&apos;t anything available to the general public. So he wants me to adapt my app to make it work for short deck. He said that he would pay for it, and he knows a bunch of other people that would.</p><p>Furthermore, he was saying that he thinks it could be a great business opportunity for me. He said that there still aren&apos;t a lot of people who play short deck, so going mass market doesn&apos;t seem like it&apos;d be the way to go, but the people who do play play super high stakes, and could be willing to pay <em>a lot</em> of money for the app. Like, hundreds of dollars a month. And possibly even thousands if I offer some sort of exclusive access, because these people really don&apos;t want their competitors getting access to it. He said that he is very, very well connected in the short deck poker world, knows everyone, etc. So we talked about how if I went through with this, we could do a thing where I give him a cut, maybe 25% or so, for anyone he gets to sign up.</p><p>I was hesitant to go off in a new direction, especially with the Red Chip thing being in the works, and having a bunch of other affiliates who said they&apos;d work with me. But this did seem like a good opportunity. So I told him that I wanted to go home and see how long I think it&apos;ll take to build a short deck version, and as long as it&apos;s nothing too crazy, I&apos;m in. Surely enough, it didn&apos;t seem like too much work to adapt it for short deck, so I texted him and said I was in.</p><h1>Things fall apart</h1><p>At this point, I end up taking a week or two to finish up something I was working on, and then I got started working on the short deck stuff. That took 2-3 weeks I think.</p><p>About a week after talking to the Red Chip guys, I texted Doug and asked if we could wait another week. He said sure. Another week passes, and I text him. He doesn&apos;t respond. Whatever. I need a little bit of time anyway. I want to finish up this short deck stuff, and more importantly, I want to see if other affiliates materialize to give me more leverage against Red Chip, and I want to talk to some more friends for advice on the revenue share amount I should do. Initially I was thinking 50%. Some said that&apos;s way too high, and 20-25% is better. Some said that&apos;s too low, and 50% makes sense when you&apos;re getting off the ground. A lot of mixed messages, so I don&apos;t really know what I should do.</p><p>Moving back to short deck, over the 2-3 weeks I work on it, I&apos;m in touch with Brad via text. He&apos;s responsive and nice. Going well. A few days in he texts me and says his partner is going to give me $500 when I finish, as an incentive for me. Great!</p><p>Eventually I finish the short deck stuff. I have a call with Brad and his two business partners. First I demo it to them. They all love it.</p><p>We ended up spending a lot of time on that call talking about my regular long deck app. One of his partners was pretty quiet; it was a different guy named Cy who did the talking along with Brad. Cy basically gave me the same spiel as Brad, about how much he hates the business. Whatever. More updating, but still nothing crazy, for the same reason as before.</p><p>Cy has some different ideas as for how to monetize the short deck stuff. He wants to create a site, eg. shortdeckstrategy.com or something. The idea is to write some articles, put my app on the site, get visitors, and put an affiliate link to a poker site like Poker Kings, and make money when people sign up for Poker Kings. Brad&apos;s agreeing with Cy. So like, a totally different direction from what Brad and I talked about initially. Initially we talked about <em>not</em> going mass market, and instead selling to all of these high stakes players that Brad is supposedly so buddy-buddy with. Throughout that call, my head was spinning a little bit. There was a lot of fast talking.</p><p>At the end of the call, we agreed that they would use the app for a little while, test it out and stuff, and we&apos;d all mull things over regarding how to monetize.</p><p>Then there&apos;s the question of how much they would pay me for the app. When Brad and I initially met, we threw around numbers like $50/month or $100/month. Nothing definite, just throwing numbers around. During this call when the topic came up, I just left the question to them and said &quot;whatever you think is fair&quot;. Brad and Cy sort of looked at each other - to the extent that you can do that in a video call. Cy was hoping for $50/month. But Brad spoke up confidently and said let&apos;s do $100/month. Cy agreed, slightly reluctantly. And that was that.</p><p>Oh, Brad also said that he knows so many people in the poker world and can introduce me to some people who could maybe be affiliates for me for my regular PPT app (as opposed to the short deck one). One in particular - Ryan Laplante. We left it off saying he would get me in touch with Ryan and hopefully some others.</p><p>A few days go by. I haven&apos;t received any payment from them. I&apos;m sure I&apos;ll get it though. I don&apos;t want to be pushy if we&apos;re going to be business partners.</p><p>I get my $100/month from each of them. But I don&apos;t get the $500.</p><p>Another few days go by, and I ask Brad about it. He&apos;s sort of my point-man.</p><p>I won&apos;t narrate the exact text history, but it was really weird. I also followed up on the intro to Ryan Laplante and others. And I asked him for Google ad advice, because he said he&apos;s good at that. A few other things I think. Sometimes he&apos;d just straight up ignore me. Sometimes I&apos;d get a short and cryptic response. For the $500, sometimes he&apos;d ignore it, sometimes he said he&apos;d ask Cy and then not get back to me.</p><p>I start to get annoyed at this. I don&apos;t want to work with someone who isn&apos;t responsive. And I definitely don&apos;t want to work with someone who promises me money and then doesn&apos;t give it to me.</p><p>Well, actually I&apos;m not sure about this. I debate it internally with myself. Maybe I should just suck it up and deal with it, because it&apos;d be too much to pass up the larger opportunity.</p><p>Let&apos;s jump back to the Red Chip thread. Eventually Doug gets back to me (he hadn&apos;t responded to my last text). He apologizes. I say no worries, let&apos;s schedule a time to chat again. His response to this was really weird. He said sure, want to come over to my house, or meet at the bar. I&apos;m confused. James, his partner, the one who seems to be more in charge of business stuff, lives in Tennessee, and we&apos;re in Vegas. I say I want to talk about money and our next steps, and I think James should be there for that. His response to this really surprised and frustrated me. It was that James is a &quot;hard guy to reach&quot;.</p><p>What?! This is your business partner. And we&apos;re in the process of working together. What&apos;s going on? It was as if our previous two conversations &#x2014; the ones we spent 4+ hours on &#x2014; didn&apos;t happen.</p><p>Eventually he says that if it involves money it needs to be in writing anyway, so why don&apos;t I write up my proposal and email it to them, and then we can talk afterwards. I don&apos;t love that idea, because to me this is a <em>fluid</em> conversation that involves back-and-forth. But sure. I email them.</p><p>I decide to totally err on the side of being generous. I was considering offering 25%, but I decide to go with 50% revenue share. So I say that in my email. I also say that I want to go with $5/month for now, the idea being that I don&apos;t think I could reach the masses &#x2014; eg. 100,000 users &#x2014; at a higher price. I said that I want to at least give that a shot. And if that doesn&apos;t work, then it means my users will be more niche and more serious players, in which case I agree with them that it makes sense to charge more.</p><p>Doug responds in this formal tone and says that they don&apos;t want to work with me.</p><p>What?!!!!! <em>What on earth just happened.</em> We had everything set up. I thought we were just negotiating the revenue share amount, and figuring out the next steps moving forward. I&apos;m so confused!</p><p>He mentions very briefly that they don&apos;t want to work with me at the low revenue per user.</p><p>That just makes no sense to me. 1) Aggregate is what matters, not per user. There aren&apos;t really any marginal costs per user. Customer support would be the big one, but I&apos;d be handling that, not them. 2) I was clear that I&apos;d only want to pursue the low price if it gets tons of users. <em>Revenue</em> is what matters. 3) At the end of the day, I am flexible. It&apos;d be nice if we could at least have a conversation about it, given that we had already spent 4+ hours talking with each other and were so close to working together.</p><p>So I respond and ask if he would mind explaining his thinking. He says they don&apos;t like the low price per user, because of the &quot;fixed costs of partnership&quot;. That makes no sense to me. I didn&apos;t think the plan was to do any fancy lawyer stuff. And all I&apos;d be looking for from them is to put the link on their site, and hopefully include it in their videos and blog posts as they see fit. So I don&apos;t know what just happened here. I would expect to at least have a conversation about it.</p><p>His response was very short and formal, again, and he clearly wasn&apos;t interested in talking more with me, so I gave up. But I had two small parting requests. The initial thing we talked about was me being on their podcast, so I asked if I could do that. He lied to me and said they only do the podcast &quot;sporadically&quot; now. It used to be once a week, now it&apos;s once every two weeks. The second thing was asking if they could include PPT in their <a href=""https://redchippoker.com/best-poker-analysis-software-2016/"">Best Poker Software</a> article, where they list out all of the options people have in terms of poker software. He said they only revisit that article once a year.</p><p>That was a total disaster. Let&apos;s get back to the short deck thing.</p><p>Actually, before that, I want to note that none of my affiliate stuff has materialized. All of the people who said that they&apos;re interested in working with me just haven&apos;t been responsive at all. I spent time trying to find other people to work with me. Vlogers, Twitch streamers, coaches, whoever I could find. I sent out a bunch of emails and messages, but nothing really materialized from that. Two leads. More on that later.</p><p>Also, I haven&apos;t gotten any new paid users. And sign ups has slowed to a crawl.</p><p>Around this time I tried to learn about marketing and stuff. Trying to figure out what else I could be doing to acquire users. I spent a lot of time on the code, and wanted to put on my marketing hat. I went through Julian Shapiro&apos;s <a href=""https://www.julian.com/guide/growth/intro"">Growth Guide</a>, which I loved. I appeared on two podcasts, but they were both small, and didn&apos;t seem to drive any traffic, let alone sign ups or paid users. I set up paid ads on Google, Bing, Reddit, and TwoPlusTwo (a popular poker site). They didn&apos;t get me any paid users though.</p><p>Also around this time, I have lunch with a guy in the industry who knows his stuff. He tells me that he&apos;d estimate Flopzilla to have between 1k and 10k purchases, at $25-35/user, which would mean a maximum of $350k. That is <em>incredibly significant information</em>. It should have blew me out of my chair, but what actually happened is that I started off thinking, &quot;Meh. Maybe it&apos;s true, maybe it&apos;s not. Whatever.&quot; From there, I slowly moved away from that and towards, &quot;Yeah, it&apos;s very true, and that means that I don&apos;t really have a business opportunity anymore.&quot;</p><p>Anyway, everything is totally falling apart for me right now. Let&apos;s get back to the short deck thing.</p><p>At some point I think through what they were saying on the call. At the time my head was spinning, but once the dust settled, going the mass market + affiliate link route did seem like a good way to monetize. So I write up an email to them explaining that I agree with that approach and what my thought process was. I ended by asking them what they think, and if we could set up a time to talk again. A week or two passes, and no one responds to that email.</p><p>I start getting a really bad vibe from the short deck guys. I start pushing for the $500 some more, and still don&apos;t get it. So I start thinking about it, and I decide that I don&apos;t think I should work with them. a) Our relationship has soured given how they&apos;ve been treating me, and b) I really question whether I even need them. Their idea was to have that shortdeckstrategy.com site, make money with affiliate links, and put my app on there for free to drive traffic (I would upsell some tools) along with them writing a few articles. But I feel like the free software is the big driver of traffic, not the articles they would write, so why don&apos;t I just put the short deck thing out there for free and put my own affiliate link on it? Why do I need them? The reason would be if they are so well connected and amazing that they figure out how to drive a bunch of traffic to the site. Something I clearly struggle to be able to do. But if they&apos;re so well connected, why are they the only three signed up for the short deck app right now? And why hasn&apos;t Brad been able to introduce me to anyone, like he said he would? It just felt fishy. Plus, the benefit would need to be quite large for me to justify working with people I don&apos;t like, and the benefit did not seem that large at all.</p><p>So I finally manage to get a lunch scheduled with Brad. Previously we had scheduled times to talk, but he flaked on me, twice I think. Before this lunch I really pushed for the $500. He finally responded and said that Cy thought he would be getting the app for $50/month, not $100/month, and that&apos;s why he hasn&apos;t paid me the $500. Ugh! That&apos;s just wrong on so many levels. I respond to Brad saying that I think that&apos;s wrong and that I am expecting to receive that money.</p><p>I decide going into it that I&apos;m basically done with them, and only would possibly work with Brad if a) I get my $500 (I&apos;m really bitter about that if you can&apos;t tell), and b) he wants to go the route of getting people to sign up for the short deck app in exchange for 25% revenue share, not their shortdeckstrategy.com thing.</p><p>So, we have lunch. I get to the restaurant. And I see <em>Cy</em> sitting there early before Brad gets there. I actually didn&apos;t even recognize him at first, what was awkward, but eventually I sit down and say hi. He immediately gives me the $500. Cool. Got that over with. That was actually the big thing I wanted to accomplish by having lunch with... well, I didn&apos;t know Cy was going to be there actually, but I was going to talk to Brad about it. But yeah, happy I got my money. No apology from either of them though, which isn&apos;t good.</p><p>During the lunch Cy vents a little more about how he doesn&apos;t think my long deck app will succeed. Why are we talking about this again? It has nothing to do with them. Whatever. I&apos;m sorta just passing time. At some point I plan on saying how I don&apos;t want to work with them on the shortdeckstrategy.com thing. I don&apos;t want to say it too early on though, because then what are we supposed to do for the rest of the lunch?</p><p>But eventually I get to it and tell them I don&apos;t see that it makes sense for us to work together on that, and that I would prefer to do it on my own. Brad is pretty taken aback. Looks like he didn&apos;t know how to respond. He says nicely that if I&apos;m going to do it on my own, then I&apos;d be competing with them, and it wouldn&apos;t make sense for us to work together. I say I agree. This is towards the end of the lunch, and I make a last attempt to see if Brad wants to do the thing where he gets 25% for anyone who he gets to sign up. He says no. Cy mentions that he&apos;s &quot;ran out of energy&quot;. We leave, and that&apos;s that.</p><p>At the end of all this, I finally start questioning whether this is something I should continue to work on.</p><h1>Things continue to fall apart</h1><p>At this point there are three big affiliates who said they were interested in working with me that I have been hoping to work with.</p><p>The first is a guy who I was introduced to through a friend, and has a popular vlog. After the friend made the intro via text, we exchanged emails and he said he&apos;s interested and we&apos;d set up a time to talk. Months had passed, and I had reached out via email maybe six or seven times to check in, and never got a response. Then one day I&apos;m at the casino playing some poker, and I see him in person at the water cooler, so I walk over. He apologizes and says that he&apos;s just so busy and has so many of these offers, and that he doesn&apos;t even like promoting other products in the first place. I make a small push, saying that it&apos;s a great product and it&apos;d be super low-effort for him: just put a link in the description. But he didn&apos;t seem interested, so I backed off.</p><p>The second is a guy who I really like and have been in touch with for about six months. He just keeps saying that he wants to work together but is too busy at the moment and needs to finish up a few things before we dive into it. I&apos;ve given up on him at this point.</p><p>The third is one is really frustrating. I appeared on his podcast, and it went pretty well. After the podcast interview, I talked with him about working together as an affiliate. I offered 50% revenue share if he&apos;s going to be an active partner, or 25% if passive. For active, I just want him to produce maybe 2-3 blog posts or videos a month. For passive, he could just throw the link wherever and hope people click it. He said he&apos;s in for the active deal. Things were very clear, and it looked like we were ready to move forward. Then, well, he just disappears.

CjW4axQDqLd2oDCGG,Misconceptions about continuous takeoff,misconceptions-about-continuous-takeoff,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CjW4axQDqLd2oDCGG/misconceptions-about-continuous-takeoff,2019-10-08T21:31:37.876Z,82,37,38,False,False,,"<p>There has been considerable debate over whether development in AI will experience a discontinuity, or whether it will follow a more continuous growth curve. Given the lack of consensus and the confusing, diverse terminology, it is natural to hypothesize that much of the debate is due to simple misunderstandings. Here, I seek to dissolve some misconceptions about the continuous perspective, based mostly on how I have seen people misinterpret it in my own experience. </p><p>First, we need to know what I even <em>mean</em> by continuous takeoff. When I say it, I mean a scenario where the development of competent, powerful AI follows a trajectory that is roughly in line with what we would have expected by extrapolating from past progress. That is, there is no point at which a single project lunges forward in development and creates an AI that is much more competent than any other project before it. This leads to the first clarification, </p><h2>Continuous doesn&apos;t necessarily mean slow</h2><p>The position I am calling &quot;continuous&quot; has been called a number of different names over the years. Many refer to it as &quot;slow&quot; or &quot;soft.&quot; I think continuous is preferable to these terms because it focuses attention on the strategically relevant part of the question. It seems to matter less what the actual clock-time is from AGI to superintelligence, and instead matters more if there are will be single projects who break previous technological trends and gain capabilities that are highly unusual relative to the past.</p><p>Moreover, there are examples of rapid technological developments that I consider to be continuous. As an example, consider <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network"">GANs</a>. In 2014, GANs were used to generate low quality black-and-white photos of human faces. By late 2018, they were used to create nearly-photorealistic images of human faces.</p><span><figure><img src=""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Dw6ZIOlX4AMKL9J?format=jpg&amp;name=small"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:97%""></figure></span><p>Yet, at no point during this development did any project leap forward by a huge margin. Instead, every paper built upon the last one by making minor improvements and increasing the compute involved. Since these minor improvements nonetheless happened rapidly, the result is that the GANs followed a fast development relative to the lifetimes of humans. </p><p>Extrapolating from this progress, we can assume that GAN video generation will follow a similar trajectory, starting with simple low resolution clips, and gradually transitioning to the creation of HD videos. What would be unusual is if someone right now in late 2019 produces some HD videos using GANs. </p><h2>Large power differentials can still happen in a continuous takeoff</h2><p>Power differentials between nations, communities, and people are not unusual in the course of history. Therefore, the existence of a deep power differential caused by AI would not automatically imply that a discontinuity has occurred.</p><p>In a continuous takeoff, a single nation or corporation might still pull ahead in AI development by a big margin and use this to their strategic advantage. To see how, consider how technology in the industrial revolution was used by western European nations to conquer much of the world.</p><p>Nations rich enough to manufacture rifles maintained a large strategic advantage over those unable to. Despite this, the rifle did not experience any <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifle#Historical_overview"">surprising developments</a> which catapulted it to extreme usefulness, as far as I can tell. Instead, sharpshooting became gradually more accurate, with each decade producing slightly better rifles.</p><p>See also: <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/PKy8NuNPknenkDY74/soft-takeoff-can-still-lead-to-decisive-strategic-advantage"">Soft takeoff can still lead to decisive strategic advantage</a></p><h2>Continuous takeoff doesn&apos;t require believing that ems will come first</h2><p>This misconception seems to mostly be a historical remnant of the <a href=""https://intelligence.org/ai-foom-debate/"">Hanson-Yudkowsky AI-Foom debate</a>. In the old days, there weren&apos;t many people actively criticizing foom. So, if you disagreed with foom, it was probably because you were sympathetic to Hanson&apos;s views.</p><p>There are now many people who disagree with foom who don&apos;t take Hanson&apos;s side. <a href=""https://sideways-view.com/2018/02/24/takeoff-speeds/"">Paul Christiano</a> and <a href=""https://aiimpacts.org/likelihood-of-discontinuous-progress-around-the-development-of-agi/"">AI Impacts</a> appear somewhat at the forefront of this new view.</p><h2>Recursive self-improvement is compatible with continuous takeoff</h2><p>In my experience, recursive self improvement is one of the main reasons cited for why we should expect a discontinuity. The validity of this argument is far from simple, but needless to say: folks who subscribe to continuous takeoff aren&apos;t simply ignoring it.</p><p>Consider I.J. Good&apos;s initial elaboration of recursive self improvement,</p><blockquote>Let an ultraintelligent machine be defined as a machine that can far surpass all the intellectual activities of any man however clever. Since the design of machines is one of these intellectual activities, an ultraintelligent machine could design even better machines; there would then unquestionably be an &#x2018;intelligence explosion&#x2019;, and the intelligence of man would be left far behind.</blockquote><p>The obvious interpretation from the continuous perspective is that by the time we have an ultraintelligent machine, we&apos;ll already have a not-quite-ultraintelligent machine. Therefore, the advantage that an ultraintelligent machine will have over the collective of humanity + machines will be modest.</p><p>It is sometimes argued that even if this advantage is modest, the growth curves will be exponential, and therefore a slight advantage right now will compound to become a large advantage over a long enough period of time. However, this argument by itself is not an argument against a continuous takeoff.</p><p>Exponential growth curves are common for macroeconomic growth, and therefore this argument should apply equally to any system which experiences a positive feedback loop. Furthermore, large strategic advantages do not automatically constitute a discontinuity since they can still happen even if no project surges forward suddenly.</p><h2>Continuous takeoff is relevant to AI alignment</h2><p>The misconception here is something along the lines of, &quot;Well, we might not be able to agree about AI takeoff, but at least we can agree that AI safety is extremely valuable in either case.&quot; Unfortunately, the usefulness of many approaches to AI alignment appear to hinge quite a bit on continuous takeoff.</p><p>Consider the question of whether an AGI would <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/r9tYkB2a8Fp4DN8yB/p/zthDPAjh9w6Ytbeks"">defect during testing</a>. The argument goes that an AI will have an instrumental reason to pretend to be aligned while weak, and then enter a treacherous turn when it is safe from modification. If this phenomenon ever occurs, there are two distinct approaches we can take to minimize potential harm.</p><p>First, we could apply extreme caution and try to ensure that no system will ever lie about its intentions. Second, we could more-or-less deal with systems which defect as they arise. For instance, during deployment we could notice that some systems are optimizing something different than what we intended during training, and therefore we shut them down.</p><p>The first approach is preferred if you think that there will be a rapid capability gain relative the rest of civilization. If we deploy an AI and it suddenly catapults to exceptional competence, then we don&apos;t really have a choice other than to get its values right the first time.</p><p>On the other hand, under a continuous takeoff, the second approach seems more promising. Each individual system won&apos;t by themselves carry more power than the sum of projects before it. Instead, AIs will only be slightly better than the ones that came before it, including any AIs we are using to monitor the newer ones. Therefore, to the extent that the second approach carries a risk, it will probably look less like a sudden world domination and will look more like a bad product rollout, in line with say, the release of Windows Vista. </p><p>Now, obviously there are important differences between current technological products and future AGIs. Still, the general strategy of &quot;dealing with things as they come up&quot; is much more viable under continuous takeoff. Therefore, if a continuous takeoff is more likely, we should focus our attention on questions which fundamentally can&apos;t be solved as they come up. This is a departure from the way that many have framed AI alignment in the past.</p>",matthew-barnett,matthew-barnett,Matthew Barnett,

Written by the psychotherapists Bruce Ecker, Robin Ticic and Laurel Hulley, it claims to offer a neuroscience-grounded, comprehensive model of how effective therapy works. In so doing, it also happens to formulate its theory in terms of belief updating, helping explain how the brain models the world and what kinds of techniques allow us to <u><a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/How_To_Actually_Change_Your_Mind"">actually change our minds</a></u>. Furthermore, if UtEB is correct, it also explains why rationalist techniques such as Internal Double Crux [<u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/mQmx4kQQtHeBip9ZC/internal-double-crux"">1</a></u> <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Z7Sk29PDYTooipXMS/internalizing-internal-double-crux"">2</a></u> <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/cvzzyKEZg4LRmvooq/internal-diet-crux"">3</a></u>] work.</p><p>UtEB’s premise is that much if not most of our behavior is driven by emotional learning. Intense emotions generate unconscious predictive models of how the world functions and what caused those emotions to occur. The brain then uses those models to guide our future behavior. Emotional issues and seemingly irrational behaviors are generated from implicit world-models (schemas) which have been formed in response to various external challenges. Each schema contains memories relating to times when the challenge has been encountered and mental structures describing both the problem and a solution to it.</p><p>According to the authors, the key for updating such schemas involves a process of memory reconsolidation, originally identified in neuroscience. The emotional brain’s learnings are usually locked and not modifiable. However, once an emotional schema is activated, it is possible to simultaneously bring into awareness knowledge contradicting the active schema. When this happens, the information contained in the schema can be overwritten by the new knowledge.</p><p>While I am not convinced that the authors are <em>entirely</em> right, many of the book’s claims definitely feel like they are pointing in the right direction. I will discuss some of my caveats and reservations after summarizing some of the book’s claims in general. I also consider its model in the light of an issue of a psychology/cognitive science journal devoted to discussing a very similar hypothesis. </p><h1>Emotional learning</h1><p>In UtEB’s model, emotional learning forms the foundation of much of our behavior. It sets our basic understanding about what situations are safe or unsafe, desirable or undesirable. The authors do not quite say it explicitly, but the general feeling I get is that the subcortical emotional processes set many of the priorities for what we want to achieve, with higher cognitive functions then trying to figure out <em>how</em> to achieve it - often remaining unaware of what exactly they are doing.</p><p>UtEB’s first detailed example of an emotional schema comes from the case study of a man in his thirties they call Richard. He had been consistently successful and admired at work, but still suffered from serious self-doubt and low confidence at his job. On occasions such as daily technical meetings, when he considered saying something, he experienced thoughts including “Who am I to think I know what’s right?”, “This could be wrong” and “Watch out - don’t go out on a limb”. These prevented him from expressing any opinions.</p><p>From the point of view of the authors, these thoughts have a definite cause - Richard has “emotional learnings according to which it is adaptively <em>necessary </em>to go into negative thoughts and feelings towards [himself].” The self-doubts are a <em>strategy</em> which his emotional brain has generated for solving some particular problem.</p><p>Richard’s therapist guided Richard to imagine what it would feel like if he was at one of his work meetings, made useful comments, and felt confident in his knowledge while doing so. This was intended to elicit information about what Richard’s emotional brain predicted would happen if it failed to maintain the strategy of self-doubt. The book includes the following transcript of what happened after Richard started imagining the scene as instructed:</p><blockquote><strong>Richard:</strong> Now I’m feeling really uncomfortable, but-it’s in a different way.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Therapist:</strong> OK, let yourself feel it - this different discomfort. <em>[Pause.]</em> See if any words come along with this uncomfortable feeling.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Richard: </strong><em>[Pause.] </em>Now they hate me.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Therapist: </strong>“Now they hate me.” Good. Keep going: See if this really uncomfortable feeling can also tell you <em>why</em> they hate you now.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Richard: </strong><em>[Pause.] </em>Hnh. Wow. It’s because… now I’m… an arrogant asshole… like my father… a totally self-centered, totally insensitive know-it-all.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Therapist: </strong>Do you mean that having a feeling of confidence as you speak turns you into an arrogant asshole, like Dad?</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Richard: </strong>Yeah, exactly. Wow.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Therapist: </strong>And how do you <em>feel</em> about being like him in this way?</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Richard: </strong>It’s horrible! It’s what I’ve always vowed <em>not</em> to be!</blockquote><p>Richard had experienced his father as being assertive as well as obnoxious and hated. His emotional brain had identified this as a failure mode to be avoided: if you are assertive, then you are obnoxious and will be hated. The solution was to generate feelings of doubt so as to stop him from being too confident. This caused him suffering, but the prediction of his emotional brain was that acting otherwise would produce even <em>worse</em> suffering, as being hated would be a terrible fate.</p><p>UtEB describes Richard as having had the following kind of unconscious schema:</p><blockquote><em><strong>Perceptual, emotional and somatic memory of original experiences:</strong> his suffering from his father’s heavily dominating, hyper-confident self-expression, plus related suffering from unmet needs for fatherly expressions of love, acceptance, understanding, validation. (This is the “raw data”; matching features in current situations are triggers of the whole schema.) </em></blockquote><blockquote><strong><em>A mental model or set of linked, learned constructs operating as living knowledge of a problem and a solution: </em></strong></blockquote><blockquote><em><strong>The problem:</strong></em> <em><strong>knowledge of a vulnerability to a specific suffering.</strong> Confident assertiveness in any degree inflicts crushing oppression on others and is hated by them. I would be horrible like Dad and hated by others, as he is, if I asserted my own knowledge or wishes confidently. (This is a model of how the world is, and current situations that appear relevant to this model are triggers of the whole schema.) </em></blockquote><blockquote><em><strong>The solution: knowledge of an urgent broad strategy and concrete tactic(s) for avoiding that suffering. </strong>Never express any confident assertiveness, to avoid being horrible and hated (general strategy and pro-symptom purpose), by vigilantly noticing any definite knowledge or opinions forming in myself and blocking them from expression by generating potently self-doubting, self-invalidating thoughts (concrete tactic and manifested symptom).</em></blockquote><p>Emotional schemas can be brought to light during a variety of ways, including <u><a href=""https://medium.com/@ThingMaker/focusing-for-skeptics-6b949ef33a4f"">Focusing</a></u>, <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5gfqG3Xcopscta3st/building-up-to-an-internal-family-systems-model"">IFS</a></u>, and imagining yourself doing something and seeing what you expect to happen as a result. </p><p>But suppose that you do manage to bring up a schema which seems wrong to you. What do you do then?</p><h1>Memory reconsolidation: updating the emotional learning</h1><p>The formation of memory traces involves <em>consolidation</em>, when the memory is first laid out in the brain; <em>deconsolidation</em>, when an established memory is “opened” and becomes available for changes; and <em>reconsolidation</em>, when a deconsolidated memory (along with possible changes) is stored and becomes frozen again. The term “reconsolidation” is also used to refer to the general process from deconsolidation to reconsolidation; UtEB generally applies the term to mean the entire process. Unless the context indicates otherwise, I do the same.</p><p>UtEB reviews some of the history of memory research. Until 1997, neuroscientists believed that past emotional learning became permanently locked in the brain, so that memories could only consolidate, never de- or reconsolidate. More recent research has indicated that once a memory becomes activated, it is temporarily unlocked, allowing it to be changed or erased. </p><p>Starting from 2004, new studies suggested that activation alone is not sufficient to deconsolidate the memory. The memories are used to predict that things will occur in a similar fashion as they did previously. Besides just activation, there has to be a significant <em>mismatch</em> between what one experiences and what the memory suggests is about to happen. The violation of expectation can be qualitative (the predicted outcome not occurring at all) or quantitative (the magnitude of the outcome not being fully predicted). In either case, it is this prediction error which triggers the deconsolidation and subsequent reconsolidation.</p><p>The memory erasure seems to be specific to the interpretation from which the prediction was produced. For example, someone who has had an experience of being disliked may later experience being liked. This may erase the emotional generalization “I am inherently dislikable”, but it will not erase the memory of the person also having been disliked.</p><h1>Applied reconsolidation: an example of the schema update process</h1><p>So, assuming that the model outlined above is correct, how does one apply it in practice?</p><p>From what we have discussed so far, the essential steps of erasing a learned belief (including an emotional schema) involves identifying it, activating it, and then finding a mismatch between its prediction and reality. </p><p>The first difficulty is that the beliefs involved with the schema are not necessarily consciously available at first. Richard knew that he suffered from a lack of self-esteem, but he was not aware of its reason. The process started from him describing in concrete details how this manifested: as skeptical self-talk during a daily meeting. </p><p>As he was guided to imagine what would happen if he didn’t have those thoughts and acted confidently, his therapist was seeking to retrieve the implicit schema and bring it into consciousness so that its contents would become available for access. Once it had been retrieved, the therapist and Richard worked together to express the belief in the schema in maximally emotional language:</p><blockquote>“Feeling <em>any</em> confidence means I’m arrogant, self-centered, and totally insensitive like Dad, and people will hate me for it, so I’ve got to <em>never</em> feel confident, ever.”</blockquote><p>The authors have developed a therapeutic approach called Coherence Therapy, whose steps closely follow the steps of the memory reconsolidation process. The example of Richard is from this school of therapy.</p><p>In Coherence Therapy (as well as related approaches, such as <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5gfqG3Xcopscta3st/building-up-to-an-internal-family-systems-model"">Internal Family Systems</a></u>), one initially avoids any impulse to argue with or disprove the retrieved schema. This would risk it being pushed away <em>before</em> it has become sufficiently activated to allow for reconsolidation. </p><p>Instead, one stays with it. Richard was given a card with the above phrase and instructed to review it every day until the next therapy session, just feeling the extent to which it felt true to him. This served to further integrate access to the schema in question, making it better consciously available.</p><p>Two weeks later, Richard had frequently noticed his self-doubt, used it as a prompt for reading the card, and experienced its description ringing true as a reason for his thoughts. When speaking with his therapist, he mentioned a particular event which had stuck in his memory. In a recent meeting, he had thought of a solution to a particular problem, but then kept quiet about it. A moment later, another person had spoken up and suggested the same solution in a confident manner. Looking around, Richard had seen the person’s solution and confidence being received positively by the others. Richard had been struck by how that reaction differed from what his schema predicted would happen if <em>he</em> had made the same suggestion in that tone.</p><p>Because Richard had made the implicit assumptions in his schema explicit, he was able to consciously notice a situation which seemed to violate those assumptions: a prediction mismatch. His therapist recognized this as a piece of contradictory knowledge which could be used to update the old schema. The therapist then guided Richard through a process intended to activate the old schema while bringing the contradictory information into awareness, triggering a reconsolidation process.</p><p>The therapist first instructed Richard to mentally bring himself back to the situation where he had just thought of the solution, but held it back. To properly activate the schema, the therapist guided Richard’s attention to the purpose behind his reluctance and Richard’s certainty of any confidence making him disliked. Next, the therapist told Richard to re-live what happened next: the other person making the same suggestion, and the other people in the room looking pleased rather than angry.</p><p>The book then has a transcript of the therapist guiding Richard to repeat this juxtaposition of the old schema and the disconfirming experience (italicized brackets in the original):</p><blockquote><strong>Therapist:</strong> Stay with that. Stay with being surprised at what you’re seeing—surprised because in your life, you’ve had such a definite knowing that saying something confidently to people will always come across like Dad, like an obnoxious know-it-all, and people will hate that. That’s what you know, yet at the same time, here you’re seeing that saying something confidently <em>isn’t</em> always like Dad, and then people are fine with it. And it’s quite a surprise to know that. <em>[That was an explicit prompting of another side-by-side experiencing of the two incompatible knowings, with the therapist expressing empathy for both, with no indication of any favoring of one knowing over the other. The therapist paused for several seconds, then asked:]</em> Does it feel true to describe it like that? Your old knowing right alongside this other new knowing that’s so different? </blockquote><blockquote><strong>Richard:</strong> <em>[Quietly, seeming absorbed in the experience.]</em> Yeah. </blockquote><blockquote><strong>Therapist:</strong> <em>[Softly.]</em> All along, it seemed to you that saying something confidently could be done only in Dad’s dominating way of doing it, and now suddenly you’re seeing that saying something confidently can be done very differently, and it feels fine to people. <em>[This was another deliberate repetition of the same juxtaposition experience.] </em></blockquote><blockquote><strong>Richard:</strong> Yeah. </blockquote><blockquote><strong>Therapist:</strong> Mm-hm. <em>[Silence for about 20 seconds.]</em> So, how is it for you be in touch with both of these knowings, the old one telling you that anything said with confidence means being like Dad, and the new one that knows you can be confident in a way that feels okay to people? <em>[Asking this question repeated the juxtaposition experience yet again, and, in addition, the “how is it” portion of the question prompted Richard to view the experience with mindful or metacognitive awareness, while remaining in the experience.] </em></blockquote><blockquote><strong>Richard:</strong> It’s sort of weird. It’s like there’s this part of the world that I didn’t notice before, even though it’s been right there. </blockquote><blockquote><strong>Therapist:</strong> I’m intrigued by how you put that. Sounds like a significant shift for you. </blockquote><blockquote><strong>Richard:</strong> Yeah, it is. Huh. </blockquote><blockquote><strong>Therapist:</strong> You’re seeing both now, the old part of the world and this other part of the world that’s new, even though it was right there all along. <em>[That cued the juxtaposition experience for a fourth time, followed by silence for about 30 seconds.] </em>So, keep seeing both, the old part and the new part, when you open your eyes in a few seconds and come back into the room with me. <em>[Richard soon opens his eyes and blinks a few times.] </em>Can you keep seeing both? </blockquote><blockquote><strong>Richard:</strong> Yeah. </blockquote><blockquote><strong>Therapist:</strong> What’s it like to see both and feel both now? <em>[With the transformation sequence complete, this question begins the next step of verification— Step V—because it probes for whether the target learning still exists as an emotional experience.] </em></blockquote><blockquote><strong>Richard:</strong> <em>[Pause, then sudden, gleeful laughter.] </em>It’s kind of funny! Like, what? How could I think that? <em>[This is an initial marker indicating that the pro-symptom schema may have been successfully disconfirmed, depotentiated, and dissolved by the transformation sequence.] </em></blockquote><blockquote><strong>Therapist:</strong> Do you mean, how could you think that simply saying what you know, or mentioning some good idea that you’ve had, would make you seem arrogant, insensitive and dominating like Dad and be hated for it? </blockquote><blockquote><strong>Richard:</strong> <em>[Laughing again.] </em>Yeah!</blockquote><p>Afterwards, the therapist and Richard wrote a new card together, which Richard was told to review daily:</p><blockquote>All along it’s been so clear that if I confidently say what I know, I will always come across as arrogant, insensitive, and dominating like Dad, and be hated for it. And it’s so weird, looking around the room and seeing that it doesn’t come across like that.</blockquote><p>The purpose of the card was to provide additional juxtaposition experiences between the old schema and the new knowledge. While the original transformation sequence might have been enough to eliminate the old schema, the schema might also have been stored in the context of many different situations and contained in several memory systems. In such a situation, further juxtapositions would have helped deal with it.</p><p>In a follow-up meeting, Richard reported having lost the feelings of self-doubt, and that speaking up no longer felt like it was any big deal. To verify that the old schema really had lost its power, the therapist tried deliberately provoking his old fears again:</p><blockquote>Dropping his voice to a quieter tone, the therapist added, “But tell me, when you have something to say and just say it, what about the danger of coming across as a know-it-all, like Dad, and being hated for that? What about your fear of that and how urgent it is to protect yourself from that?” [...]</blockquote><blockquote>Richard took in the question, gazed at the therapist in silence for a few seconds, and then replied, “Well, I don’t know what to tell you. All I can say is, that doesn’t trouble me any more. And hearing you say it, it seems a little strange that it ever did—like, what was my problem?”</blockquote><h1>Applied reconsolidation: the schema update process in general</h1><p>Now that we have looked at a specific example, we can look at a more general version of the process.</p><h2>Accessing sequence</h2><p>In Coherence Therapy, the <em>accessing sequence </em>is the preliminary phase of making both a person’s implicit schema and some disconfirming knowledge accessible, so that they can be used in the juxtaposition process:</p><ol type=""1""><li><em>Symptom identification. </em>Establishing which specific symptoms the person regards as problematic, and when and where they manifest. In Richard’s case, the general symptom was a lack of confidence, which specifically manifested as negative self-talk in meetings.</li><li><em>Retrieval of target learning. </em>Bringing into explicit awareness the purpose behind the symptoms. This can then be used to guide the search for disconfirming knowledge, as well as accessing the original schema in order to reconsolidate it. In Richard’s case, the purpose was to avoid expressing confidence in a way that would make people hate him.</li><li><em>Identification of disconfirming knowledge. </em>Identifying some past or present experience which directly contradicts the original learning. This knowledge does not necessarily need to feel “better” or “more positive” than the old one, just as long as it is mutually exclusive with the old one. In Richard’s case, the disconfirming knowledge was the experience of his co-worker confidently proposing a solution and being well-received.</li></ol><h2>Erasure sequence</h2><p>Once both the target schema and the disconfirming knowledge are known, the erasure steps can be applied to update the learning:</p><ol type=""1""><li><em>Reactivation of the target schema. </em>Tapping into the felt truth of the original learning, experiencing it as vividly as possible.</li><li><em>Activation of disconfirming knowledge, mismatching the target schema. </em>Activating, at the same time, the contradictory belief and having the experience of simultaneously believing in two different things which cannot both be true.</li><li><em>Repetitions of the target-disconfirmation pairing.</em></li></ol><p>Something that the authors emphasize is that when the target schema is activated, there should be no attempt to explicitly argue against it or disprove it, as this risks pushing it down. Rather, the belief update happens when one experiences their old schema as vividly true, while <em>also </em>experiencing an entirely opposite belief as vividly true. It is the juxtaposition of believing X and not-X at the same time, which triggers an inbuilt contradiction-detection mechanism in the brain and forces a restructuring of one’s belief system to eliminate the inconsistency.</p><p>The book notes that this distinguishes Coherence Therapy from approaches such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, which is premised on treating some beliefs as intrinsically irrational and then seeking to disprove them. While UtEB does not go further into the comparison, I note that this is a common complaint that I have heard of CBT: that by defaulting to negative emotions being caused by belief distortions, CBT risks belittling those negative emotions which are actually produced by <em>correct</em> evaluations of the world. </p><p>I would personally add that not only does treating all of your beliefs - including emotional ones - as provisionally valid <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/KaByYSRwSLdscGYB6/actually-updating"">seem to be a requirement</a></u> for actually updating them, this approach is also good rationality practice. After all, you can <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/jiBFC7DcCrZjGmZnJ/conservation-of-expected-evidence"">only seek evidence to test a theory, not confirm it</a></u>. </p><p>If you notice different parts of your mind having conflicting models of how the world works, the correct epistemic stance should be that you are trying to figure out which one is true - not privileging one of them as “more rational” and trying to disprove the other. Otherwise it will be unavoidable that your preconception will cause you to dismiss as false beliefs which are actually true. (Of course, you can still reasonably <em>anticipate</em> the belief update going a particular way - but you need to take seriously at least the <em>possibility</em> that you will be shown wrong.) </p><p>This can actually be a relief. Trying to stack the deck towards receiving favorable evidence would just also sabotage the brain’s belief update process. So you might as well give up trying to do so, <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/jiBFC7DcCrZjGmZnJ/conservation-of-expected-evidence"">relax, and just let the evidence come in</a></u>.</p><p>I speculate that this limitation might also be in place in part to help avoid the error where you decide which one of two models is more correct, and then discard the other model entirely. Simultaneously running two contradictory schemas at the same time allows both of them to be <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/zucjLBpQ9S9eWPWGu/p/yeADMcScw8EW9yxpH"">properly evaluated and merged</a></u> rather than one of them being thrown away outright. I suspect that in Richard’s case, the resulting process didn’t cause him to entirely discard the notion that some behaviors will make him hated like his dad was - it just removed the overgeneralization which had been produced by having <u><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underfitting"">too little training data as the basis of the schema</a></u>.</p><p>Of course, this means that there does need to be some contradictory information available which <em>could</em> be used to disprove the original schema. One might have a schema for which no disconfirmation is available because it is correct, or a schema which might or might not be correct but which is making things worse and cannot easily be disconfirmed. UtEB mentions the example of a man, ""Tómas"", who had a desire to be understood and validated by someone important in his life. Tómas remarked that a professional therapist who was being paid for his empathy could never fulfill that role. The update contradicting the schema that nobody in his life really understood him, would have to come from someone actually in his life.</p><p>Another issue that may pop up with the erasure sequence is that there is another schema which predicts that, for whatever reason, running <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/hnLutdvjC8kPScPAj/integrating-disagreeing-subagents#Resisting_belief_integration"">this transformation may produce adverse effects</a></u>. In that case, one needs to address the objecting schema first, essentially be carrying out the entire process on it before returning to the original steps. (This is similar to the phenomenon in e.g. <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5gfqG3Xcopscta3st/building-up-to-an-internal-family-systems-model"">Internal Family Systems</a></u>, where objecting parts may show up and have their concerns addressed before work on the original part can proceed.)</p><h2>Verification step</h2><p>Finally, after the erasure sequence has been run, one seeks to verify that lasting change has indeed happened and that the target schema has been transformed. UtEB offers the following behavioral markers as signs that a learning which has previously generated emotional responses has in fact been erased:</p><ul><li>“A specific emotional reaction abruptly can no longer by reactivated by cues and triggers that formerly did so or by other stressful situations.”</li><li>“Symptoms of behavior, emotion, somatics, or thought that were expressions of that emotional reaction also disappear permanently.”</li><li>“Non-recurrence of the emotional reaction and symptoms continues effortlessly and without counteractive or preventive measures of any kind.”</li></ul><p>The authors interpret current neuroscience to say that only memory reconsolidation can produce these kinds of markers. They cannot be produced by counteractive or competitive processes, such as trying to learn an opposite habit to replace a neurotic behavior. Counteractive processes are generally fragile and susceptible to relapse. When these markers are observed in clinical work, UtEB argues that one may infer that reconsolidation has led to the original learning being replaced. </p><h2>Further examples</h2><p>For additional examples of the schema update process, I recommend reading the book, which contains several more case studies of issues which were dealt with using this approach. Here’s a brief summary of the most detailed ones (note that some of these examples are actually more detailed and include additional complications, such as more than one symptom-producing schema; I have only summarized the most prominent ones to give a taste of them):</p><ul><li>“Charlotte”. <em>Issue</em>: obsessive attachment to a former lover. <em>Schema: </em>“It would be much better if I was merged with my lover”. <em>Contradictory knowledge: </em>The harm caused by not having boundaries.</li><li>“Ted”. <em>Issue: </em>an inability to hold a steady job and a general lack of success in life. <em>Schema: “</em>If my life is a mess, my father will be forced to admit how badly he screwed up as a parent.” <em>Contradictory knowledge: </em>Realizing that Ted’s father would never admit failure, no matter what.</li><li>“Brenda”. <em>Issue: </em>stage fright when having a leading role in an upcoming play. <em>Schema: </em>being on the stage in front of an audience means being unable to get off, causing helplessness similar to when Brenda was in a car with her alcoholic father and couldn’t get off. <em>Contradictory knowledge: </em>re-imagining the scene and the way how Brenda <em>could</em> actually have gotten out of the car.</li><li>“Travis”. <em>Issue: </em>inability to experience intimate emotional closeness in relationships. <em>Schema: </em>“Nobody will pay attention to how I feel or give me understanding for how I’m hurting. I don’t matter, and I’m all on my own.” <em>Contradictory knowledge: </em>the therapist’s empathic presence and listening.</li><li>“Regina”. <em>Issue: </em>strong anxiety and panic during/after interacting with other people. <em>Schema: </em>“I’m acceptable and lovable only if I do everything <em>perfectly</em>.” <em>Contradictory knowledge: </em>Regina’s Uncle Theo loves her regardless of what imperfections she might have.</li><li>“Carol”. <em>Issue: </em>wanting to avoid sex with her husband despite feeling emotionally close to him. <em>Schema: </em>engaging in any sexuality means being overtly sexual and harming Carol’s daughter, in the way that Carol was harmed by her mother’s overt sexuality. <em>Contradictory knowledge: </em>once the schema was made conscious, it activated the brain’s spontaneous mismatch detection mechanisms and started to feel silly.</li></ul><p>As the last item suggests, sometimes just making a schema explicit is enough to start to dismantle it. The authors suggest that the brain has a built-in detection system which compares any consciously experienced beliefs for inconsistencies with other things that a person knows, and can spontaneously create juxtaposition experiences by bringing up such inconsistent information. They suggest that therapies which are based on digging up previously unconscious material, but which do not have an explicit juxtaposition step, work to the extent that the uncovered material happens to trigger this spontaneous mismatch detection. (We already saw this happening with Richard - once his underlying schema had been made conscious, he was startled to later notice what seemed like a contradiction.)</p><p>One may note the connection to <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/x4n4jcoDP7xh5LWLq/book-summary-consciousness-and-the-brain"">the model in <em>Consciousness and the Brain</em></a></u> that when some subsystem in the brain manages to elevate a mental object into the content of consciousness, multiple subsystems will synchronize their processing around that object. If the object is an explicit belief, then any subsystem which is paying attention to that object may presumably detect inconsistencies with that subsystem’s own models.</p><p>Besides these case studies from Coherence Therapy, the authors also analyze published case studies from Accelerated Experiental Dynamic Psychotherapy, Emotion-Focused Therapy, Eye-Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing, and Interpersonal Neurobiology. They try to show how these cases also carried out a juxtaposition process, even if the theoretical frameworks of those therapies did not explicitly realize it. It is the claim of the authors that any therapy which causes lasting emotional change does it through reconsolidation. Finally, the book contains four essays from other therapists (using Coherence Therapy and EMDR), who analyze some of their own case studies.</p><h1>Evaluating the book’s plausibility</h1><p>Now that we have looked at the book’s claims, let’s look at whether we should believe in them.</p><p>It is unclear to me how reliable the neuroscience results are; the authors cite a number of studies, but each individual claim only references a relatively small number of them. </p><p>On a brief look, I could not find any reviews or papers that would have directly made a critical assessment of the book’s model. However, I found something that might be even better.</p><p><em>Behavioral and Brain Sciences </em>is a respected journal covering subject areas across the cognitive sciences. BBS publishes “target articles” which present some kind of a thesis or review about a particular topic, together with tens of brief commentaries which respond to the target article, and a final response by the target article’s authors to the commentaries. </p><p>In 2015, four prestigious (with a total of 500 published research articles between them) psychologists published a BBS target article, <em><u><a href=""https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Memory-reconsolidation%2C-emotional-arousal%2C-and-the-Lane-Ryan/75445997e033bb3130b041fc3c5a1bc9961c3feb"">Memory reconsolidation, emotional arousal, and the process of change in psychotherapy: New insights from brain science</a></u></em> (Lane et al. 2015). While the exact model that they outline has a number of differences from the UtEB model, the core idea is the same: that therapeutic change from a wide variety of therapeutic approaches, “including behavioral therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, emotion-focused therapy, and psychodynamic psychotherapy, results from the updating of prior emotional memories through a process of reconsolidation that incorporates new emotional experiences.”</p><p>One interesting difference was that Lane et al. describe emotional schemas somewhat differently. In their model, the schemas form memory structures with three mutually integrated components: emotional responses, episodic/autobiographical memories, and semantic structures (e.g. abstract beliefs which generalize over the various incidents, such as the claim that “people are untrustworthy”). Any of these components can be used as an entry point to the memory structure, and can potentially update the other components through reconsolidation. They hypothesize that different forms of therapy work by accessing different types of components: e.g. behavior therapy and emotion-focused therapy access emotional responses, conventional psychoanalysis uses access to biographical memories, and cognitive behavioral therapy accesses semantic structures.</p><span><figure><img src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/v1673354691/mirroredImages/i9xyZBS3qzA8nFXNQ/teicy7hfutmlffhzxytb.png"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:99%""></figure></span><p>I read the target article, all the commentaries, and the responses. Given the similarities between Lane et al.’s model and the UtEB model, I think we can consider the responses to Lane et al. to generally offer a useful evaluation of the UtEB model as well. </p><p>One significant difference which needs to be noted is that Lane et al.’s model of memory reconsolidation does not mention the requirement for a prediction mismatch before reconsolidation can happen. This was remarked on in the response from UtEB’s authors. In their counter-response, Lane et al. noted UtEB’s model to be highly compatible with theirs, and remarked that further research is needed to nail down the conditions which make reconsolidation the most effective.</p><p>The other responses to Lane et al. were mostly from psychologists, psychiatrists, and neuroscientists, but also included the occasional economist, philosopher, philologist and folklorist. Several of the responses were generally positive and mostly wanted to contribute additional details or point out future research directions. </p><p>However, there were also a number of skeptical responses. A common theme which emerged from several concerned the limitations of the current neuroscience research on memory reconsolidation. In particular, most of the studies so far have been carried out on rats, and specifically testing the elimination of a fear response to electric shocks. As one of the responses points out, “neither the stimuli nor the subjects are generalizable to the kind of rich autobiographical memories involved in therapy.” A number also raised the question whether all therapeutic change really involves reconsolidation, as opposed to some related mechanism, such as creating new memory structures which compete with the original as opposed to replacing it.</p><p>My non-expert reading is that the critical responses are right in that a gap remains between the clinical and behavioral findings on the other hand, and the neuroscience findings on the other. There are various patterns which can be derived from psychological research and clinical therapy experience, and a small number of neuroscience findings which establish the existence of something that <em>could</em> explain those patterns. However, the neuroscience findings have only been established in a rather narrow and limited context; the connection between them and the higher-level patterns is a plausible link, but it remains speculative nonetheless. </p><p>Personally I consider the book’s model tentatively promising, because it seems to explain many observations which I had independently arrived at <em>before</em> reading it. For example, I had noticed an interesting thing with anxieties, where I let e.g. a sensation of social anxiety stay active in my mind, neither accepting it as truth <em>nor</em> pushing it away while I went to do social things. This would then <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/8ZrDp7d5t4fwKXfj3/tentatively-considering-emotional-stories-ifs-and-getting"">cause the anxiety to update</a></u>, making me feel less anxious if it was indeed the case that the social interaction was harmless. This fits nicely together with the framework of an activated memory structure becoming open to reconsolidation and then being updated by a prediction mismatch (the situation not being as bad as expected). </p><p>Likewise, in my post <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/hnLutdvjC8kPScPAj/integrating-disagreeing-subagents"">Integrating disagreeing subagents</a></u>, I reviewed a variety of rationality and therapeutic techniques, and suggested that they mostly worked either by merging or combining two existing models that a person’s brain already had, or augmenting the existing models by collecting additional information. </p><p>In particular, I considered an example from cognitive behavioral therapy, where a man named Walter was feeling like he was impossible to be in a relationship with after he had broken up with his boyfriend. At the same time, he did not think that someone <em>else</em> breaking up with their partner was an indication of them being impossible to be in a relationship with. He and his therapist role-played an interaction where the therapist pretended to be a friend who had recently broken up, and Walter explained why this did not make the friend a relationship failure. In the process of doing so, Walter suddenly realized that he wasn’t a failure, either.</p><p>I commented:</p><blockquote>Walter was asked whether he’d say something harsh to a friend, and he said no, but that alone wasn’t enough to improve his condition. What did help was putting him in a position where he had to really think through the arguments for why this is irrational in order to convince his friend, and then, after having formulated the arguments once himself, get convinced by them himself.</blockquote><blockquote>In terms of our framework, we might say that a part of Walter’s mind contained a model which output a harsh judgment of himself, while another part contained a model which would output a much less harsher judgment of someone else who was in otherwise identical circumstances. Just bringing up the existence of this contradiction wasn’t enough to change it: it caused the contradiction to be noticed, but didn’t activate the relevant models extensively enough for their contents to be reprocessed.</blockquote><blockquote>But when Walter had to role-play a situation where he thought of himself as actually talking with a depressed friend, that required him to more fully activate the non-judgmental model and apply it to the relevant situation. This caused him to blend with the model, taking its perspective as the truth. When that perspective was then propagated to the self-critical model, the easiest way for the mind to resolve the conflict was simply to alter the model producing the self-critical thoughts.</blockquote><p>This seems like a straightforward instance of belief juxtaposition, and one where I ended up independently deriving something like UtEB’s memory reconsolidation model: I too noted that the relevant belief structures need to be simultaneously activated in the right way to allow for the brain to revise one of them after noticing the contradiction. In general, UtEB’s model of how things work rings true in my experience, making me inclined to believe that its description of how therapy works is correct, and that its model of how it is connected to neuroscience might also be.</p><h1>UtEB and the subagent model</h1><p>As many readers know, I have been writing <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/ZbmRyDN8TCpBTZSip"">a sequence of posts</a> on multi-agent models of mind. In <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5gfqG3Xcopscta3st/building-up-to-an-internal-family-systems-model"">Building up to an Internal Family Systems model</a></u>, I suggested that the human mind might contain something like subagents which try to ensure that past catastrophes do not repeat. In <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/oJwJzeZ6ar2Hr7KAX/subagents-akrasia-and-coherence-in-humans"">subagents, coherence, and akrasia in humans</a></u>, I suggested that behaviors such as procrastination, indecision, and seemingly inconsistent behavior result from different subagents having disagreements over what to do.</p><p>As I already mentioned, my post on <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/hnLutdvjC8kPScPAj/integrating-disagreeing-subagents"">integrating disagreeing subagents</a></u> took the model in the direction of interpreting disagreeing subagents as conflicting beliefs or models within a person’s brain. <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/u5RLu5F3zKTB3Qjnu/subagents-trauma-and-rationality"">Subagents, trauma and rationality</a></u> further suggested that the appearance of drastically different personalities within a single person might result from unintegrated memory networks, which resist integration due to various traumatic experiences.</p><p>This post has discussed UtEB’s model of conflicting emotional schemas in a way which further equates “subagents” with beliefs - in this case, the various schemas seem closely related to what e.g. Internal Family Systems calls “parts”. In many situations, it is probably fair to say that this is what subagents are.</p><p>That said, I think that while this covers a very important subset of subagents, not <em>everything</em> which I have been referring to as a subagent falls straightforwardly under the belief-schema model. In <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7zQPYQB5EeaqLrhBh/subagents-neural-turing-machines-thought-selection-and"">subagents and neural Turing machines</a></u> as well as <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/HbXXd2givHBBLxr3d/against-system-1-and-system-2-subagent-sequence"">Against “System 1” and “System 2”</a></u>, I also covered subagents in a more general way, as also including e.g. the kinds of subsystems which carry out object recognition and are used to carry out tasks like arithmetic. This was also the lens through which I looked at subagents in <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/x4n4jcoDP7xh5LWLq/book-summary-consciousness-and-the-brain"">my summary of Consciousness and the Brain</a></u>. Which kind of view is the most useful, depends on exactly what phenomenon we are trying to understand.</p>",Kaj_Sotala,kaj_sotala,Kaj_Sotala,

There&#x2019;s a vague idea that agenty systems pursue consistent goals in a wide variety of environments, and that various characteristics are necessary for this flexible goal-oriented behavior.</p><p>But once we get into the nitty-gritty, it turns out we don&#x2019;t really have a full mathematical formalization of these intuitions. We lack a characterization of agents.</p><p>To date, the closest we&#x2019;ve come to characterizing agents in general are the <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/RQpNHSiWaXTvDxt6R/coherent-decisions-imply-consistent-utilities"">coherence theorems</a></u> underlying Bayesian inference and utility maximization. A <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Q9JKKwSFybCTtMS9d/what-are-we-assuming-about-utility-functions?commentId=txxigiqZ7FRD2nB2o"">wide variety of theorems</a></u> with a wide variety of different assumptions all point towards agents which perform Bayesian inference and choose their actions to maximize expected utility. In this framework, an agent is characterized by two pieces:</p><ul><li>A probabilistic world-model</li><li>A utility function</li></ul><p>The Bayesian utility characterization of agency neatly captures many of our intuitions of agency: the importance of accurate beliefs about the environment, the difference between things which do and don&#x2019;t consistently pursue a goal (or approximately pursue a goal, or sometimes pursue a goal&#x2026;), the importance of updating on new information, etc.</p><p>Sadly, for purposes of AGI alignment, the standard Bayesian utility characterization is incomplete at best. Some example issues include:</p><ul><li>The <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/Rm6oQRJJmhGCcLvxh/p/zcPLNNw4wgBX5k8kQ"">need for a cartesian boundary</a></u> - a clear separation between &#x201C;agent&#x201D; and &#x201C;environment&#x201D;, with well-defined input/output channels between the two</li><li><u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/Rm6oQRJJmhGCcLvxh/p/efWfvrWLgJmbBAs3m"">Logical omniscience</a></u> - the assumption that agents can fully compute all of the implications of the information available to them, and track every possible state of the world</li><li><u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/3xF66BNSC5caZuKyC/why-subagents"">Path independence and complete preferences</a></u> - the assumption that an agent doesn&#x2019;t have a general tendency to stay in the state it&#x2019;s in</li></ul><p>One way to view <u><a href=""https://intelligence.org/files/TechnicalAgenda.pdf"">agent foundations</a></u> research is that it seeks a characterization of agents which resolves problems like the first two above. We want the same sort of benefits offered by the Bayesian utility characterization, but in a wider and more realistic range of agenty systems.</p><h2>Characterizing Real-World Agents</h2><p>We want to characterize agency. We have a bunch of real-world systems which display agency to varying degrees. One obvious strategy is to go study and characterize those real-world agenty systems.</p><p>Concretely, what would this look like?</p><p>Well, let&#x2019;s set aside the shortcomings of the standard Bayesian utility characterization for a moment, and imagine applying it to a real-world system - a financial market, for instance. We have various coherence theorems saying that agenty systems must implement Bayesian utility maximization, or else allow arbitrage. We have a <u><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis"">strong prior</a></u> that financial markets don&#x2019;t allow arbitrage (except perhaps very small arbitrage on very short timescales). So, financial markets should have a Bayesian utility function, right? Obvious next step: pick an actual market and try to figure out its world-model and utility function.</p><p>I tried this, and it didn&#x2019;t work. Turns out markets don&#x2019;t have a utility function, in general (in this context, it&#x2019;s called a &#x201C;<u><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_agent"">representative agent</a></u>&#x201D;).</p><p>Ok, but markets are still inexploitable and still seem agenty, so where did it go wrong? Can we generalize Bayesian utility to characterize systems which are agenty like markets? This was the line of inquiry which led to &#x201C;<u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/3xF66BNSC5caZuKyC/why-subagents"">Why Subagents?</a></u>&#x201D;. The upshot: for systems with internal state (including markets), the standard utility maximization characterization generalizes to a multi-agent committee characterization.</p><p>This is an example of a general strategy:</p><ul><li>Start with some characterization of agency - don&#x2019;t worry if it&#x2019;s not perfect yet</li><li>Apply it to a real-world agenty system - specifically, try to back out the characterizing properties, e.g. the probabilistic world-model and utility function in the case of a Bayesian utility characterization</li><li>If successful, great! We&#x2019;ve gained a useful theoretical tool for an interesting real-world system.</li><li>If unsuccessful, first check whether the failure corresponds to a situation where the system actually doesn&#x2019;t act very agenty - if so, then that actually supports our characterization of agency, and again tells us something interesting about a real-world system.</li><li>Otherwise, we&#x2019;ve found a real-world case where our characterization of agency fails. Look at the system&#x2019;s actual internal behavior to see where it differs from the assumptions of our characterization, and then generalize the characterization to handle this kind of system.</li></ul><p>Note that the last step, generalizing the characterization, still needs to maintain the structure of a characterization of agency. For example, <u><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospect_theory"">prospect theory</a></u> does a fine job predicting the choices of humans, but it isn&#x2019;t a general characterization of effective goal-seeking behavior. There&#x2019;s no reason to expect prospect-theory-like behavior to be universal for effective goal-seeking systems. The coherence theorems of Bayesian utility, on the other hand, provide fairly general conditions under which Bayesian induction and expected utility maximization are an optimal goal-seeking strategy - and therefore &#x201C;universal&#x201D;, at least within the conditions assumed. Although the Bayesian utility framework is incomplete at best, that&#x2019;s still the <em>kind</em> of thing we&#x2019;re looking for: a characterization which should apply to all effective goal-seeking systems.</p><p>Some examples of (hypothetical) projects which follow this general strategy:</p><ul><li>Look up the <u><a href=""https://www.pnas.org/content/105/39/14855"">kinetic equations governing chemotaxis</a></u> in e-coli. Either extract an approximate probabilistic world-model and utility function from the equations, find a suboptimality in the bacteria&#x2019;s behavior, or identify a loophole and expand the characterization of agency.</li><li>Pick a financial market. Using whatever data you can obtain, either extract (not necessarily unique) utility functions and world models of the component agents, find an arbitrage opportunity, or identify a new loophole and expand the characterization of agency.</li><li>Start with the weights from a neural network trained on a task in the <u><a href=""https://gym.openai.com/"">openai gym</a></u>. Either extract a probabilistic world model and utility function from the weights, find a strategy which dominates the NN&#x2019;s strategy, or identify a loophole and expand the characterization of agency</li></ul><p>&#x2026; and so forth.</p><h2>Why Would We Want to Do This?</h2><p>Characterization of real-world agenty systems has a lot of advantages as a general research strategy.</p><p>First and foremost: when working on mathematical theory, it&#x2019;s easy to get lost in abstraction and lose contact with the real world. One can end up pushing symbols around ad nauseum, without any idea which way is forward. The easiest counter to this failure mode is to stay grounded in real-world applications. Just as a rationalist lets reality guide beliefs, a theorist lets the problems, properties and intuitions of the real world guide the theory.</p><p>Second, when attempting to characterize real-world agenty systems, one is very likely to make <em>some</em> kind of forward progress. If the characterization works, then we&#x2019;ve learned something useful about an interesting real-world system. If it fails, then we&#x2019;ve identified a hole in our characterization of agency - and we have an example on hand to guide the construction of a new characterization.</p><p>Third, characterization of real-world agenty systems is directly relevant to alignment: the alignment problem itself basically amounts to characterizing the wants and ontologies of humans. This isn&#x2019;t the only problem relevant to FAI - tiling and stability and subagent alignment and the like are separate - but it is basically the whole &#x201C;alignment with humans&#x201D; part. Characterizing e.g. <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ZdCztwnxXu3aC4kxZ/the-e-coli-test-for-ai-alignment"">the wants and ontology of an e-coli</a></u> seems like a natural stepping-stone.</p><p>One could object that real-world agenty systems lack some properties which are crucial to the design of aligned AGI - most notably reflection and planned self-modification. A theory developed by looking only at real-world agents will therefore likely be incomplete. On the other hand, you don&#x2019;t figure out general relativity without figuring out Newtonian gravitation first. Our understanding of agency is currently so woefully poor that we don&#x2019;t even understand real-world systems, so we might as well start with that and reap all the advantages listed above. Once that&#x2019;s figured out, we should expect it to pave the way to the final theory: just as general relativity has to reproduce Newtonian gravity in the limit of low speed and low energy, more advanced characterizations of agency should reproduce more basic characterizations under the appropriate conditions.

Bxxh9GbJ6WuW5Hmkj,What's the dream for giving natural language commands to AI?,what-s-the-dream-for-giving-natural-language-commands-to-ai,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Bxxh9GbJ6WuW5Hmkj/what-s-the-dream-for-giving-natural-language-commands-to-ai,2019-10-08T13:42:38.928Z,14,4,8,False,False,,"<p><strong>0</strong></p><p>I promised in a <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NvqGmLBCtvQxfMs9m/the-artificial-intentional-stance"">previous post</a> that I would give a post-mortem for a scheme for learning the intentional stance from natural language. This is that post. But first, I should explain why such an idea might seem good in the first place.</p><p>Some people think of AI as a genie. The goal of AI research, in this  picture, is to ""tell the AI what to do,"" sometimes explicitly in natural  language. And then since the AI is smart, it will understand what we mean and do that, because to do something else would be stupid.</p><p>This is, in a sense, very naive. Making an AI that does what we want is not at all like instructing a human - <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/cnYHFNBF3kZEyx24v/ghosts-in-the-machine"">see the relevant Eliezer post</a> - the methods, dangers, and goals are all different. But... if the AI understood what we meant, maybe we <em>could</em> just tell it what to do.</p><p>Of course, ""understood what we meant"" captures more or less the whole problem, because meaning isn't like the charge of the electron, it's nowhere in the words themselves. When you understand moral language, you're implicitly using your morals. But what if we trained an AI so that it <em>functionally</em> understood moral language - would that be implicitly using your morals too, and isn't that exactly what we want?</p><p><strong>1 - The Artificial Intentional Stance</strong></p><p>I like to think of myself as having preferences, but at the same time I am made of atoms, and my preferences are not-like-the-charge-of-the-electron, they're nowhere in the atoms. Instead, my preferences are an abstraction that I (and others) use when thinking about me.</p><p>So part of the this artificial intentional stance stuff can be summed up as: get the AI to think about humans like humans think about humans. (Another part is that abstractions are contagious. If I want to go to the gym, to handle this correctly this you need abstractions not just for me but also for the gym.)</p><p>We often put too much magic into the word ""understand."" If the AI can hold a good conversation and extract real-world information from human speech, it's reasonable to say it understands what we're saying. And then once it understands us, you might think ""communicating our goals to it is a lot like communicating with a human.""</p><p>But it's easy to hold a decent conversation without taking the intentional stance towards humans, and easier still to extract real-world information from human speech without the intentional stance. This leads to problems that become clear if you try to take an AI that does a good job at modeling language, and follow step by step how to get it to choose actions that are good for humans.</p><p>The dream is to learn the intentional stance by using the information implicit in our use of language. The intentional stance requires picking out good levels of abstraction to model humans on, and using language implies that the good levels of abstraction are the ones humans implicitly use in language. Is this what we want? I don't know, it might be?</p><p>It certainly isn't the only option - we might imagine other schemes involving trying to amplify emulations of humans, semi-supervised learning from examples of good and bad behavior, or multi-stage chains of making increasingly trustworthy AIs. But the question is whether it's <em>an</em> option.</p><p><strong>3 - Process</strong></p><p>It's not hard to hook up a videocamera to an image captioner to a deep reinforcement learner and say you can input goals with natural language because when you set the goal to ""cat,"" your camera will look for cats. It's a lot harder to get that camera to look for what's best in life.</p><p>This is the bind I got myself into, writing this post. Value learning schemes that are simple are wrong (issues with the cat camera above are left as an exercise to the reader), and value learning schemes that seem promising have been selected for incomprehensibility and poor epistemic luck. So I tried to split the difference, if favoring interestingness over simplicity.</p><p>Here's some of the rules of thumb I used when thinking of ways to apply natural language processing to value learning:</p><p>First, I wanted to avoid the scheme having <em>glaringly</em> unspecified parts. It's very easy to be lazy and not specify something enough that it actually chooses actions, or feel like I've made progress but not be able to apply it. Usually either of these meant I was sweeping problems under the rug - the right level of specificity involves sweeping out some of those cobwebs.</p><p>Second, I needed to encourage myself to be specific about the intended purpose of natural language processing in each particular scheme. Yes, the dream is that it ""includes common sense"" or something like that, but that's not specific enough mental technology to tell whether you're solving the intended problem without unnecessary side effects, or explain why different methods get different results.</p><p>It was profitable to think of natural language processing as being targeted at the <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Mizt7thg22iFiKERM/concept-safety-the-problem-of-alien-concepts"">problem of alien concepts</a>: when the AI can match your training examples but still fail to generalize how you want because it's representing your examples in an alien way. For example, an image classifier might learn to distinguish dogs by the texture of their fur, but we're not going to be happy with how that generalizes to fur-less dogs or dog-less fur. Now replace ""dogs"" with ""human values"" and ""fur"" with ""superficial features that work well on the training set.""</p><p>An even more specific purpose of natural language would be ""greedy reification"" - actively trying to form concepts that correspond to linguistic tokens. So if we have a word ""dog,"" we want to incentivize the AI to form a concept that picks out dogs in the world-model, and then the hope is that this also works on ""human values.""</p><p><strong>4 - Mort</strong></p><p>So here's a value learning scheme: try to squish the world and natural language into the same latent space, just with different input/output functions.</p><p>Training this simultaneous model might just be separately trying to do encoding-decoding or prediction tasks with sensory data and text, but more plausibly it should involve translation tasks where we can associate words with sensory environments. The model required is somewhat subtle, because we don't want words associated with raw sense data, we want words associated with the state of the AI's model of the world. This mandates that to the world-model, this latent space should look like the persistent state associated with sequence prediction or encoding-decoding of sequences of sense data, with transition dynamics partially included in the shared information. This means the language model should also look like sequence prediction or encoding with some local state consisting of the high-level features.</p><p>If I haven't said anything impossible so far, we could use sufficiently advanced technology to train this simultaneous model so that it's good at understanding both the world and language, and competent at turning one into the other when it comes to simple training examples. Can you now solve value learning by giving it a bunch of English descriptions what we want (""human values satisfied,"" ""do the right thing,"" ""a fulfilling and cosmopolitan future for the galaxy,"" et c.), and coding it to choose actions that make the state of the world like that?</p><p>Looking on the bright side first, what advantages might this have?</p><ul><li>It leverages the structure of language in a way that might be what we want, by training its shared high-level features to be suitable for language modeling as well as world-modeling. This is that greedy reification property - the label ""dog"" gets a representation that captures the functional properties of the ""dog"" label in human speech and description of the world, which is at least a higher order of problem than the image classifier that identifies ""dog"" with the texture of dog fur.</li><li>The knowledge of the world also impacts the verbal reasoning. If we ask it to do some difficult verbal task involving rotating imagined objects, the dream is that it could take advantage of some shared representation that would code for rotating objects on the world-model side, and so has the right dynamics.</li><li>Scaling seems to work in our favor. To the extent that this model follows our naive notion of ""understanding,"" the better it understands what we mean the better job it will do.</li><li>With small modifications, it could mimic CIRL's state of uncertainty about human values. It would need to keep track of (and properly update) uncertainty in its model and propagate that forward to uncertainty in its reward, which it can then maximize by picking strategies that account for value of information.</li></ul><p>What are some big issues with this? Take a second if you like.</p><p>No, really, I'd be interested in what people come up with on their own. I don't understand this family of schemes as well as I'd like.</p><p>Ready? Okay:</p><ul><li><strong>1)</strong> The communication between the two sides could be incomplete. In fact, we would expect there to be parts of the shared latent space that one side ignores but get treated as useful information by the other, if they get separate training. This is worrisome if we want to rely on translating a difficult verbal concept into an opinion on states of the world - what if key information is encoded in the features that the other encoder has learned to ignore? To the extent that the phrase ""human values"" does help us predict the world, it seems like this should be one of the problems that decreases with increasing competence, but I'm not totally sure.</li><li><strong>2)</strong> This simple scheme has zero extra protection from unintended maxima. Goodhart's law rears its ugly head - if our target is a particular state of the model of the world, then maybe there are nearby world-states that score well on the objective function but are ""unnatural"" in some way. This is a general problem that appears any time you have a system trained on prediction but asked to do intervention. How does this square with using natural language to learn non-alien concepts? It seems plausible that natural language might help concepts generalize to new contexts that are well-suited to language, but still leave some unnatural contexts lurking around misclassified.</li><li><strong>3)</strong> At first blush, this doesn't care about metaethics. It doesn't take into account what we'd like to like, or how we think about values, in order to change its own function. It's not a process that learns about humans and then outputs a decision procedure, it's a fixed decision procedure that extensively uses learning about humans. It's possible that this could actually be patched by putting our meta-ethical desires into the verbal ""wish"" - or even our desire for it to learn a model of meta-ethics. Each such kludge seems to increase the difficulty of the task, but I'm not sure if anything actually breaks (or if anything actually gets solved).</li><li><strong>4)</strong> (3) wouldn't be a problem if this were meta-ethically great, but it's probably not. The most glaring example is that it aims for a fixed goal state at an approximately fixed level of abstraction, which may not be what we'd want on reflection. If we think of the goal state as living in some ""slice"" along the translation of features from language to microphysical states of the world, it's conceivable that we choose (or set some mysterious hand-tuned parameter) to put this slice at the wrong place (or maybe there is no right place). Using planning towards a goal also means that it's happy to violate deontological rules, and take you apart if it can sue your atoms for something better.</li></ul><p><strong>5 - Wrap-up</strong></p><p>Going back to the artificial intentional stance and the problem of alien concepts, it seems like this helps in some ways but not in others.</p><p>It seems to help with the intentional stance at the object level - the everyday work of translating ""Charlie wants to go to the gym"" into reasonable actions - but not at the meta-level. It's doubtful that it's modeling humans how they want to be modeled. Maybe this indicates that it would be profitable to break down this concept further. It also might spark your imagination about how to take the same information about humans and end up with something that models humans in a variable way.</p><p>A different thing is going on in the department of alien concepts, where we've run into the stress that Goodhart's law places on concepts. Instead of thinking about human-modeling, this makes me want to focus on the decision procedure and training. Can we find a decision procedure that leverages prediction and translation tasks in a way that puts less stress on the concepts? Can we use a training procedure that reduces the context shift when trying to use the model to choose actions?</p><p>Overall I think this avenue is pretty interesting to think about. Maybe this also serves as a concrete example of what I mean by trying to create the artificial intentional stance, which can be generalized from language to other options for learning about humans.</p>",Charlie Steiner,charlie-steiner,Charlie Steiner,

<p>Epistemic Status: Looks pretty dead</p>
<p>Artifact had every advantage. Artifact should have been great. Artifact <em>was </em>great for the right players, and had generally positive reviews. Then Artifact fell flat, its players bled out, its cards lost most of their value, and the game died.</p>
<p>Valve takes the long view, so the game is being retooled and might return. But for now, for all practical purposes, the game is dead.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/the-long-haul/e/60197868?autoplay=true"">Richard Garfield and Skaff Elias have one take on this podcast</a>. They follow up with more thoughts <a href=""https://win.gg/news/1306"">in this interview.</a></p>
<p>Here’s my take, which is that multiple major mistakes were made, all of which mattered, and all of which will be key to avoid if we are to bring the combination of strategic depth and player-friendly economic models back to collectible card games.</p>
<p>I see ten key mistakes, which I will detail below.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Alas, we do not get to run controlled experiments. The lack of ability to experiment and iterate was the <em>meta-level </em>problem with Artifact. The parts of the game that Valve knew how to test, and knew to test, were outstanding, finely crafted and polished. The parts that Valve did not test had severe problems.</p>
<p>We will never know for sure which reasons were most critical, and which ones were minor setbacks. I will make it clear what my guesses are, but they are just that, guesses.</p>
<h3>Reason 1: Artifact Was <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/07/25/complexity-is-bad/"">Too Complex</a>, Complicated and Confusing</h3>
<p>Artifact streams were difficult to follow even if you knew the game. As teaching tools they didn’t work at all. I heard multiple reports that excellent streamers were unable to explain to viewers what was going on in their Artifact games.</p>
<p>I was <em>mostly </em>able to follow streams when I had a strong strategic understanding of the game and all of its cards and recognized all the cards on sight. Mostly.</p>
<p>I was fortunate to learn Artifact in person with those deeply committed to it, at the Valve offices, and in a setting where I had several days with no distractions to become comfortable with the game and how it worked. All eight of us who were introduced to the game that week got what it was about and had fun. We were able to pass through hours of not knowing why our heroes had died or our cards hadn’t worked the way we expected.</p>
<p>But that’s all an extraordinary bar to entry. It also helped that we were playing against each other, rather than spikes from the internet beating us over the head with netdecks.</p>
<p>Valve did amazingly great work on the user interface that, in addition to making the game beautiful, made it as clear as possible what was going on at all times. It wasn’t enough.</p>
<p>What <em>was </em>enough was the same thing that Magic: The Gathering players need: A human who will sit down with you and explain how things work. No other solution comes close.</p>
<p>Whenever I talked to players who bounced off Artifact, even top professional Magic players, complexity was <em>always</em> the number one complaint.</p>
<p>I introduced Gaudenis Vidugiris to the game. He bounced off. Too complicated.</p>
<p>I introduced Sam Black to the game. He bounced off. Too complicated.</p>
<p>I played in a tournament match during the beta against Andrew Cuneo. He knew the basic rules but had no idea what was going on and felt lost and helpless. He bounced off.</p>
<p>Randy Buehler reported it took him about <em>two weeks </em>to start understanding things well enough to begin having fun.</p>
<p>If those four think your game is too complicated and hard to grasp, I have some news. Your game is too complicated and hard to grasp. There is no large audience that is <em>more sophisticated </em>than that, that wants <em>more complexity </em>than that.</p>
<p>Artifact when you don’t know what is going on is a frustrating experience. I was only able to <em>enjoy </em>playing Artifact when I was playing most days, and making it my strategic gaming focus, and giving games the attention they deserved. When I did that, I had some of the best and most intensive and interesting gaming experiences I can remember. Whenever I tried to phone things in, it became quickly clear there was no point.</p>
<p>Some of us stuck with the game through those problems and got tens or hundreds of hours of good experiences out of the game. But eventually it took its toll on all of us. When <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2018/12/28/card-balance-and-artifact/"">Valve started changing cards</a>, I lost heart and gave up, no longer confident that my mastery of this complex information and its strategic implications would last long enough to justify the continued investment.</p>
<p>I loved Artifact. I love complex games and love that they exist and that others love them. It brings me joy to know others are building superstructures in Minecraft, Dwarf Fortress and Europa Universalis. Whenever I was at the World Boardgaming Championships I would devote entire days to games of Advanced Civilization, then I would check on those who devoted their entire week to a single game of Global War, and would have done the same for any games of Empires in Arms. But it is worth noting that as much as I admire them and want to try them, I have never <em>played </em>Global War or Empires in Arms. They take too long, require too much dedication, and I could never make it happen. They’re a bridge or two too far.</p>
<p>The most extreme case might be, interestingly, the game Artifact was based on: Dota 2. Dota 2 takes <em>dozens of hours </em>before one is able to play the game as anything other than a training exercise. I tried to learn it by having someone sit down and play a learning game with me. It lasted an hour. At the end of that hour, I felt only marginally closer to understanding the game. I still was so bad at the game that <em>I suspected I was hurting my team by doing anything at all rather than staying in the starting area doing nothing. </em></p>
<p>Tutorials continue to be a grand unsolved problem. It’s not clear that most of them aren’t actively counterproductive for games at this level, and we shouldn’t just assign experienced players to teach and mentor newer players. No other tech is known to work (and for Dota 2, even that seemed like it wasn’t great).</p>
<p>Despite these problems, Dota 2 is huge, and hugely successful. Part of that is greater resonance. Part of that is path dependence, as so many players have made the investment and that has justified it to others. Part of that is that the game pays off in hundreds or thousands of hours. But it’s not like I can watch a stream of Dota 2 and have any idea what is going on in the sense that people watching Artifact don’t know what is going on. It’s not like I feel there’s a reasonable path to learning the game, even though I’ve wanted to at various points.</p>
<p>It is easy to see why complexity didn’t seem like a mission critical issue for the Dota 2 card game, when Dota 2 itself arguably has these issues even worse than Artifact. And as Artifcact designers Richard Garfield and Skaff Elias point out, even if you knock out 90%+ of all potential players with this, that still leaves plenty of eager potential participants. The point is a few players who love you, not to appeal to everyone.</p>
<p>I don’t think this had to be fatal on its own, but it put a lot of pressure on the game to deliver the goods elsewhere to make up for it.</p>
<h3>Reason 2: Artifact Was Too Skill Testing</h3>
<p>Artifact announced it was handing Stanislav Cifka a million dollars.</p>
<p>They worded this as an announcement of a million dollar first prize tournament. Technically, many of us had hope it might be us. But we all knew, in our heart of hearts, it was going to be Stanislav Cifka. He owned all of us throughout the beta, going through entire tournaments without dropping games. The one time I can think of he did lose, it was through a clear tactical error in the final.</p>
<p>I entered one Artifact tournament after the game premiered, and played in several beta tournaments. Results were, shall we say, mixed.</p>
<p>In <em>every </em>case, for <em>every </em>match that I won, I could point to impactful errors by my opponent.</p>
<p>In <em>every </em>case, for <em>every </em>match that I lost, I knew I had made key mistakes and deserved to lose.</p>
<p>Good players in Artifact have a <em>huge </em>advantage against bad players. Great players have the same advantage against good players.</p>
<p>If you had to line up players such that the player in front would dominate the player behind them such that an upset would be very surprising (so let’s say 400 ELO points distance), for Magic: The Gathering you’d get something like (Top Player -&gt; PTQ Level Player -&gt; Reasonable Store Player -&gt; Bad Player) for four players in the row. I can see a case for three or five.</p>
<p>Chess would have (2800 -&gt; 2400 -&gt; 2000 -&gt; 1600 -&gt; 1200 -&gt; 800) so it would have six.</p>
<p>Artifact would have <em>at least </em>six. It might have seven.</p>
<p>That is too much skill testing, especially for a game that people didn’t <em>think </em>was all that skill testing. Players noticed all the bad parts of too much skill testing without the benefits.</p>
<p>What made this hard to see? Artifact had lots of random events, but they were mostly small rather than adding up, so all that did was give better players unique situations to roll with and plan for. It had lots of decisions with long term payoffs, that compounded and played in to each other. Poorer players didn’t even notice many of the things that were causing them to lose. And this all plays into reason three.</p>
<h3>Reason 3: Artifact Wasn’t Random Enough but Was Perceived as Random in Bad Ways</h3>
<p>Randomness is vital to games. The biggest benefits of randomness are variety of game play and game situations, such that the game feels fresh, the opportunity for tension and surprise, the chance for players to beat players who are better than them so worse players so more matchups remain interesting and poor players do not lose interest, and giving players the chance to make interesting strategic choices where they have to decide what risks are acceptable and worthwhile.</p>
<p>As Garfield and Skaff point out in their textbook, luck and skill are not opposites. But Artifact definitely had (if anything) too much skill, and did not have enough luck. After a while, the games start to bleed together, following similar patterns. There are lots of little random events that can be good or bad for you, but those even out, so the better player reliably crushed the weaker player, more than in any other known card game.</p>
<p>The randomness the game did have was great. Knowing when to risk a bad arrow, or hope for a good one, and how to maximize your chances of getting one, was quite interesting, as was trying to maximize your chances of lining up well with where heroes would end up within a lane, or what would happen based on where the enemy placed their heroes versus where you would place yours, or your chance of getting the item you wanted out of your store, and so forth.</p>
<p>The problem is that if you add up a lot of little random things, you get far less than additive amounts of net randomness in the result. But you might get <em>more than additive </em>amounts of <em>perceived </em>randomness. Players see each individual random element as part of a constant barrage. And the randomness that Artifact did have was too often the kind of explicit non-card-draw randomness that creates player ire and complaints.</p>
<p>Mark Rosewater and others who work on Magic often note that players react to different kinds of randomness in different ways. Coin flips and die rolls are the worst, when one outcome is clearly good for a player and the other bad, because they stick out as explicit intentional randomness. There is a reason we all hated Frenetic Efreet, and why we don’t make cards like that anymore.</p>
<p>The arrows of Artifact felt to players like that kind of randomness. As opposed to drawing different cards in the wrong order or wrong place, or having the tools for the wrong matchup, which are forms of randomness people accept.</p>
<p>The distributions of heroes, and who lined up against who, especially in the opening, was the same. Sometimes you would have heroes face off and someone would go back to the fountain on turn one. Other times, they’d miss each other entirely. That was a big swing that players had little control over, although they could build their decks to assert more or less control over it. The secret was that losing those flips was much less bad than it appeared, since the hero comes back two turns later to the lane of your choice and not that much damage gets dealt to the tower. It definitely risks a runaway via item purchases, or perhaps very quick tower kills, but it’s quite manageable by design. Thus, it didn’t actually let bad players beat good players that often. But it sure <em>felt </em>like it did.</p>
<p>The lesson is to do your best to hide your randomness where it isn’t viewed as the bad kind of random, and to make sure it is available in at least some large chunks. Artifact’s best randomness was the placement of heroes simultaneously, because it doesn’t feel like randomness. The shop items also felt ‘fair’ because they were drawing cards from a deck.</p>
<h3>Reason 4: Artifact Had No Meaningful Outer Loop</h3>
<p>When Artifact launched, you could enter a casual queue and play matches that meant nothing. Or, you could enter a competitive queue that cost $1 (one ticket, if you played keeper draft you had to bring packs as well) and returned slightly less than that in value. That seems like the actual minimum charge required to keep the matches interesting without embracing toxic free-to-play style mechanics that would have destroyed card value along with the overall game experience. So hats off to them for charging <em>just enough </em>to keep it interesting, and not a cent more.</p>
<p>The problem was that this was <em>all </em>you had to do, unless you found a tournament online that would last all day and was definitely a niche product.</p>
<p>Winning at first did not bring any benefits whatsoever, beyond the small return from the tournament itself. The only benefit of winning was you played against harder opponents, but your rating was invisible to you, so you got to experience the frustration of not winning more when you got better at the game without the reward of knowing that you were improving via the rating. There were no larger prizes or thresholds or other things to aspire to, beyond what the community created for itself.</p>
<p>Later, Artifact added experience points and levels in a tacked-on fashion, parallel to the ratings that actually mattered and continued to remain hidden. The new system meant that if you played games, you had a number that slowly went up, which slowly gave you a small number of packs and icon rewards, and allowed you to have a higher number next to your name. It was really weird that I could know <em>how many games </em>my opponent played, but not how good they were in any real fashion. This seemed to not fit a game that was so much about skill.</p>
<p>There was no meaningful ‘collect cards’ outer loop, because drafting cards was not a practical way to assemble what you needed – any reasonable person would simply buy what they wanted, especially once the prices started coming down. There was no meaningful achievement loop. When I thought about playing games, I did not expect to get any form of reward beyond the game itself, other than the opportunity to improve my skills. In today’s world, that is not acceptable.</p>
<p>What should Artifact’s outer loop have been? At a minimum, Artifact could have had a system that allowed qualification towards its big prize tournaments. Given Artifact’s emphasis on skill, giving players a competitive structure to climb seems like the obvious thing to do, and was something that was promised in the form of a million dollar tournament that was never delivered – which at least to me severely damages the credibility of future Valve promises. Artifact should also have given players the chance to know their true Elo ratings. What they did offer, in the form of cumulative rewards, was much better than nothing, but the rewards quickly became few and far between in a way that felt super far away, leaving players without realistic aspirations, and strongly encouraged players to play only a small number of games before mostly maxing out. Without getting into the weeds here too much, there are a lot of ways to vastly improve how much such a system encourages play.</p>
<p>Another key part of the outer loop is ‘keeping up’ with expansions. When one plays in Arena, Hearthstone or Eternal, one is constantly aware that one’s collection naturally decays over time, with continuous play required to get the cards to keep going. The only alternative is payment. Artifact of course was planning to have expansions, but not even one of them was ever announced. This was an underappreciated huge deal. Without knowledge of a future expansion, the most important and unique outer loop of all was crippled – my collection was complete and would remain so for the indefinite future.</p>
<h3>Reason 5: Artifact Had No Good Budget Format</h3>
<p>What is so weird is that they ran cash prize tournaments in a very good budget format, called Commons Only, during the beta. This format spontaneously turned out to foster interesting play that focused on lane resource allocation, as playing only commons means that mostly things in a given lane remain stuck in that lane. This is an excellent way to get one’s feet wet, as the game does not need to be grasped as a unified whole in the same way. It had several viable decks at the highest level that covered the four colors.</p>
<p>Then for some reason, this did not become a default format to offer players. I still have no idea why, beyond fear that players might not feel enough need to buy more cards, but I don’t model Valve as thinking that way. Without a budget format that could sustain itself, the game seemed much more expensive and off-putting, as playing Artifact with inferior tools can be very disheartening.</p>
<p>This then made Artifact’s economic model seem and be worse than it would have been otherwise, making one of their biggest problems even worse.</p>
<h3>Reason 6: Artifact’s Economic Model Was Marketed Poorly and Misconstrued</h3>
<p>I put this before the important <em>real </em>flaws in the economic model because I believe that <em>perception </em>of Artifact’s model as greedy, stingy, unreasonable and out of step with the times was far more hurtful than the real flaws it had. Artifact had in effect a perfectly reasonable economic model, but players did not see it that way.</p>
<p>What happened? A lot of it was the way the model was presented. Artifact did not highlight its customer-friendly economic features.</p>
<p>Artifact charged minimal amounts for tournament and draft participation, even allowing you to play for free if you chose to do so, at the expense of your opponents not having a strong incentive to give the games their full attention. When entry was charged, the rake taken on it was very small.</p>
<p>This is a big deal. In all the other collectible card games I know, playing limited <em>is something you earn through grinding, or something you buy at remarkably high hourly rates. </em></p>
<p>In Artifact, once you pay the initial $20 fee, <em>you can draft as many times as you want, for free, forever. </em></p>
<p>That’s the best drafting deal ever offered, and that is how Artifact’s offering should have been framed. It is also how the bulk of players should have been playing the bulk of their games.</p>
<p>If players had thought of Artifact as a $20 experience that allowed you to play its primary mode of play forever, and also gave you assets you could sell to get a lot of that $20 back (in the first week you could get <em>more than all </em>of that $20 back, although that did not last) then players would have seen that this is a good deal the same way that paying $30 for Slay the Spire or $60 for Dragon Quest XI is a good deal. You then have an option to play constructed, which can cost up to a few hundred for a complete set of playable cards, but there is no one forcing you to do that if it is not interesting to you.</p>
<p>The cost of constructed in Artifact started around $200, then decreased as the game failed, but $200 for a full set of playable cards from a large set compares favorably to what you would pay in other similar games. It compares even better if you consider that you can sell those cards afterwards and hope to potentially even profit, and you can choose to buy only those cards you need, without having to go through a super inefficient dusting or wildcard system.</p>
<p>But none of that mattered, because all people heard was ‘Artifact is not free to play.’ This cached out as two things: Artifact costs $20 initially (whether or not this was at first effectively $0 given that the cards you get along with that can be sold) and Artifact does not reward your daily play with cards that suffice to let you build a constructed deck. Players only considered the question of ‘how generous are you to people who don’t want to ever pay money but do want to build a collection’ and generally looked for markers of generosity within the free-to-play business model <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2018/02/10/eternal-and-hearthstone-economy-versus-magic-economy/"">I consider deeply flawed</a>, rather than considering the system holistically or comparing it to a normal pay-to-play title.</p>
<p>Thus, players got angry, and the game got review bombed, and professional reviews constantly referred to the game as greedy and as using an aggressive, outdated business model. Once that becomes the story, you’re in deep trouble, whether or not it is accurate.</p>
<h3>Reason 7: Artifact’s Economic Model Was Flawed</h3>
<p>As much as I will defend Artifact’s economic model as being unfairly maligned and having the right overall concepts at its foundation, the execution of those ideas was botched. One of the ways this happened was very not subtle and should have been obvious, especially since I tried to caution them about it. The others were understandable mistakes that would have been difficult to notice in advance.</p>
<p>The big mistake was to lock all transactions to the Steam Marketplace, preventing players from transacting with each other directly, and then take a 15% cut of every transaction.</p>
<p>15% is a freaking huge fee, and the desire to collect that fee ruled out any ability to loan cards or give cards to friends. Thus, the ability to let a friend play a deck you’ve assembled, or try out something cool, was gone.</p>
<p>Players ended up feeling tied to their cards a large percentage of the amount they would have felt tied with no ability to sell at all. One of the big advantages of having cards that can transfer is the ability to recapture value, but a 15% transaction tax makes that story far more difficult to tell. Another is to have tight markets so you feel like you’re getting a fair price when you buy or sell. Magic Online provides this through the use of trading bots, so you don’t feel like trading is too expensive. The problem is that if every card comes with a 15% fee, then that makes any profitable trading strategy need to widen out by 15% <em>on top of </em>the 15% fee, so they can pay the 15% when it’s their turn to pay it. So effectively there is a <em>30% </em>gap between buy and sell prices, plus the profits to the dealers who are worried their inventory will lose value and at paying large costs to get rid of things they no longer want, so you’re looking at a gap of 40% minimum when you don’t have ‘natural’ flow to trade against. That is super punishing.</p>
<p>Combine that with an interface for trading where it suggests prices you might want to seek to pay, but which often fail to actually make a trade happen, and the whole experience is super frustrating. I felt bad every time I went to use the market for a non-trivial purpose, and all my dreams of speculation or investment in undervalued cards went away completely the moment I saw the market structure.</p>
<p>Even worse was that the game was creating sources of surplus card flow to be dumped onto the market, debasing the value of the cards. Starting a new account forced players to open $20 of product, without giving most people much reason to keep those cards, since they would end up mostly playing limited or leaving the game entirely. So why wouldn’t they reclaim what value they could by dumping everything into the market, even at a big loss? Then, when this flow pushed prices down, players saw cards as an increasingly bad investment, further depressing demand, and accelerating the downward price spiral set in motion by a declining player base.</p>
<p>We add to that the giving away of product in daily rewards. The daily rewards may not have looked like much to players, but it was still a large flooding of the market, because many of the players getting the free packs had no reason to hang onto them when they could get some steam credit by dumping the cards. I’ve been working on modeling this interaction for some time, and I firmly believe that you mostly must choose two of these three: either give cards away steadily for free, <em>or </em>allow cards to be exchanged freely, <em>or </em>allow cards to retain value. If you give away cards and let them be exchanged, the market floods and value is depressed. If you give away cards and want them to retain value, you have to lock those cards down (if not all cards) to avoid this. If you don’t give away cards for free, then value is maintained because incoming supply is always paid for, so unless you have a large decline in the player base, someone is paying for that supply at whatever price you charge.</p>
<p>If you’re going to have a marketplace and want your cards to have value, it imposes real restrictions on you. What you distribute has to be chosen very carefully. Players need to fully own their cards and be able to reasonably transfer them. Players need assurances that their card value will be protected.</p>
<p><em>You have to mean it, or it won’t work.</em></p>
<p>Reason 8: Artifact Set Expectations Too High</p>
<p>Artifact came from Valve and Richard Garfield, based upon DOTA 2, looking better and with more polish than any other digital card game has ever launched with by a wide margin. The game is gorgeous, the result of years of loving detail and care, and came after a long gap of game publishing from a studio with a long record of hits. It was presented as the Next Big Thing, and a lot of people got super excited. Tons of players tried it out when it launched.</p>
<p>Alas, a lot of those players had no business playing Artifact, because they weren’t the type of player who enjoys that level of complex strategic interaction. And also alas, the game launched essentially unfinished, because it didn’t have its outer loops in place in any form, and without a good way to bring new players up to speed, but it was presented as fully ready rather than early access.</p>
<p>This resulted in a strong early peak in users, followed by a huge decline, which looked like failure and also did terrible things to the market, and resulted in terrible reviews because people were evaluating the game against a standard it never had a hope of meeting.</p>
<p>If Artifact had launched first as early access, allowing players to first view it as a game in progress, all of that could have been avoided. It also would have allowed them to fix their problems before it was too late, because they would have avoided the next issue.</p>
<h3>Reason 9: Artifact Did Not Run the Right Tests Because They Didn’t Test Their Economy</h3>
<p>Artifact ran an extensive beta test where many of us played a lot of games. The problem was that what they <em>didn’t </em>do was test Artifact where players did not have full card access. Throughout the beta, players were given complete collections.</p>
<p>Which was super awesome for the players, and allowed us to better test the ‘final form’ of the constructed format. What it didn’t do was give an idea of how players would in practice interact with the game. What would their experience be? What would they choose to do, what types of decks would they build and face? Would the economy work? How would desire to build a collection interact with and drive player spend and behavior? And so on.</p>
<p>These are super important questions. Artifact’s test of them was on launch day.</p>
<p>Arena solved this problem by running a beta with its full economy working as designed, with credits from card purchases being given when the cards were reset later. That solution is not available to a game with a full marketplace, especially if you want to predict player actions and market dynamics, so the problem isn’t a trivial one to solve. If I buy a copy of Drow Ranger in the market, someone gets that money, so Valve can’t refund it without taking those proceeds away.</p>
<p>My guess is that would indeed be the right thing to do – to take those profits away upon reset. For the test period, cards and packs cost Relics which can be bought with steam credits, and the market trades in Relics. At the reset, Relics are destroyed, and all funds used to purchase Relics are returned as either steam credits or as funds one can use to purchase selected items in Artifact.</p>
<p>The important task is to impose some set of reasonable card access restrictions, and see how players build decks, play the game and use the market in response to that.</p>
<h3>Reason 10: Artifact Did Not React Well or Quickly to Initial Failures and Did Almost No Press</h3>
<p>It is normal for a game to see a huge decline in play numbers over its first few weeks. No one knows that better than Valve. So it was understandable for Valve not to be too concerned about the decline in numbers over the first few weeks, until it was clear that the ongoing trajectory was not going to improve. More troubling should have been the reviews of various types that were coming in, the reports of players dropping the game or not streaming or watching the game due to complexity concerns, and other not-the-number-of-users red flags.</p>
<p>What initial reactions they did have, enshrining free drafting and giving a first draft of player achievements and rewards for playing, were good starts, but did not turn around the narrative. Valve counted, as it has done in other cases, on its players to get the word out. That didn’t work, and players continued to view the economy as greedy and the game as having nothing for them to do.</p>
<p>Still, those stopgaps combined with the excellent reception the game got from many lovers of deep strategy games, bought Valve some time. During that time, they could have made further improvements, offered more things to do, or at least announced future things and improvements that players could anticipate. They also did not engage in any public interactions that showed they were aware of the issues, or illustrated their thinking or intentions.</p>
<p>Also importantly, for a game whose core success strategy was supposed to involve top level competition, they left actual competitions entirely in the hands of outsiders. There were some cool tournaments held, but Valve itself didn’t have any planned or offered. Players who came to the game without knowing about the tournaments didn’t realize there was any organized play. What play was organized didn’t have a clear path to getting involved other than either knowing someone or signing up for a single elimination all day tournament through discord. When I say all day, I mean all day. I think giving us a few Grand Prix style events, with five figure prize pools, that could be qualified for via wins or win rates in queued events, would have gone a long way towards tiding things over. Having that feed into a fully announced and scheduled million dollar first prize tournament? Even better.</p>
<p>Instead, every week that went by we all wondered whether Valve would be willing to follow through, or would instead abandon its pledge. Which is what eventually happened – it turned out to be a conditional promise that had assumed the game’s success. Why were we still playing?</p>
<p>When the time came to address the metagame being stale, and people complaining about some cards being better than others, Valve responded not by printing or releasing new cards or expansions, but by <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2018/12/31/card-rebalancing-and-economic-considerations-in-digital-card-games/"">changing cards via fiat</a>. This got them a lot of initial good press they had at least <em>done something to respond to players and shake the game up. </em>I saw that response, and thought that perhaps my negative reaction had been premature. If they kept changing things to keep the game dynamic, and embraced this new system, that would be tough on card value and make it especially taxing on players who tried to take breaks from the game, but they would be providing new and different experiences, show responsiveness to the player base, and be able to iterate towards where they needed to be while we waited for the first expansion.</p>
<p>Alas, such iterated changes did not come, nor did more radical changes or any announced plans. When the first set of changes did not revive the player base on its own, that was it. So we never got to find out what that experiment would have looked like, or whether it would have worked. Nor did we try releasing the first expansion to see if that helped shake things up and make people think of the game as a changing and evolving thing.</p>
<p>I respect the hell out of ‘it will be released when it is ready’ as a principle of game creation. Kudos to those with the resources and determination to pull it off. But<em> </em>once one releases a game that requires continuous play and a critical mass of players, one no longer has the luxury of time. One certainly does not have the luxury of time with no communications.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Artifact was, <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2018/11/22/review-artifact/"">as my review made clear</a>, a uniquely amazing game in important ways. It did a lot of things uniquely right. Alas, it also did a lot of things uniquely wrong. I’ve listed ten. If we could fix one of the ten, could we have saved the game? My guess is that no one of them alone would have been enough to turn the game into a success if it were fixed, but each of them would have made a substantial difference. Solving a lot of them, I believe, would have been enough. While the complexity issue in particular is a huge deal, that complexity also brought many benefits, and I think that with proper handling of other issues the complexity problem could have been navigated, as it was in the original DOTA 2. It was the combined weight of so many different problems that ended up bringing the game down.</p>
<p>Could the game still be saved? There is a bad taste in everyone’s mouth, legacy economic problems that will weigh on the enterprise, and the players have almost all checked out. At this point, time pressure is no longer a major concern, as everything that can be lost to delays has already been lost. If the game came back in a few years, with solutions for its problems and proper support including prize support, I do believe it can still be a modest success on its own terms. I do not expect that to happen.</p>
<p>The greater tragedy would be to draw broad conclusions about what is fatal to a game, and for Artifact to become a way to inhibit innovation and drive games towards becoming Hearthstone clones (or otherwise stick to existing templates) even more than they already do. The more we realize how many different ways there are to improve our prospects when exploring interesting new space, the better our chances for creating the next unique great thing.</p>

bgCmoEtNhyYDqaskZ,Realigning Housing Coalitions,realigning-housing-coalitions,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/bgCmoEtNhyYDqaskZ/realigning-housing-coalitions,2019-10-08T11:10:01.584Z,10,4,1,False,False,,"

There are currently two main coalitions in US housing politics in high
cost-of-living areas:



<ul>

<li><p>Developer / Pro-business / YIMBY: make it
easier to build more housing.  Allow higher densities, more
subdivision, and smaller units.  Lower affordable housing minimums,
lower parking minimums, lower anything else that acts as a tax on
development.</p></li>

<li><p>Anti-displacement / Affordable housing / Landlord / NIMBY: new housing
is luxury housing, they're building units that are too small for
families, this construction only benefits the small slice of
people rich enough to afford it.  There's already too much traffic,
not enough parking, and construction means tree removal.  Stop condo
conversions and evictions.  Impose a transfer tax to stop
speculators.</p></li>

</ul>



<p>

This division has been shifting some, however, with the development of
density bonus programs.  The idea is, developers are allowed to build
more units than zoning would normally allow, but they also have to
make a larger fraction of them available below market rate.  For
example, an affordable housing bonus density program could apply to a
property where current zoning would allow eight $1M units and two
affordable $400k units, and offer an option of ten $1M units and ten
affordable $400k units.  Programs like this have several advantages:



</p>

<p>

</p>

<ul>

<li><p>The number of new affordable units built is higher than it
would be under either current zoning or a new zoning that simply
increased the required fraction of affordable units.</p></li>

<li><p>The total number of units available, regardless of
affordability, is higher, taking pressure off the market
elsewhere.</p></li>

<li><p>The housing actually gets built, because construction is
profitable.</p></li>

</ul>



<p>

Other programs along these lines could include:

</p>

<ul>

<li><p>Remove parking minimums for new housing that's near
transit, allowing more housing to be built in a way that doesn't cause
as much traffic.</p></li>

<li><p>Remove parking minimums for new housing that
<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/housing-without-street-parking"">isn't entitled to street
parking</a> and pre-pays for decades of public transit passes</p></li>

<li><p>Raise the cap on on floor-area-ratio more than the cap on
allowed units, leading developers to build more family-sized
units.</p></li>

<li><p>For buildings with tenants, allow higher density for landlords
that retain their tenants while rebuilding, providing interim housing
and similarly affordable units in the new building.</p></li>

</ul>



<p>

<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/housing-realignment-big.png""><img src=""https://www.jefftk.com/housing-realignment.png"" /></a>

</p>

<p>

These have the same structure, allowing higher density in exchange for
improvements elsewhere: affordability, traffic, parking, number of
family-sized units, displacement.  A coalition along these lines could
be pretty broad, and include most of the the anti-displacement,
affordable housing, developer, business, and YIMBY camps. I'm sad that
Cambridge's <a href=""https://www.cambridgema.gov/CDD/Projects/Housing/~/media/74B9BB16BB974B619201B2AC17489EC3.ashx"">affordable
housing overlay proposal</a> has been <a href=""http://www.cambridgeday.com/2019/09/10/affordable-housing-overlay-is-tabled-quietly-after-year-of-fiery-debate-but-due-to-return/"">put
on hold</a> after only getting 5/9 councillors when it needed 6/9, but
I think future efforts in this direction are very promising.

To simplify our reduction of these philosophical challenges into &#x201C;merely&#x201D; engineering ones, we suppose that unlimited computation and a complete low-level causal model of the world and the adult human brains in it are available.</p><p>Given such a model, the AI attributes beliefs and values to a brain in two stages. First, it identifies the syntax of a brain&#x2019;s mental content by selecting a decision algorithm which is i) isomorphic to the brain&#x2019;s  causal processes and ii) best compresses its behavior while iii) maximizing charity. The semantics of that content then consists first in  sense data that primitively refer to their own occurrence and then in logical and causal structural combinations of such content.</p><p>The resulting decision algorithm can capture how we decide what to <em>do</em>, but it can also identify the ethical factors that we seek to determine when we decide what to <em>value</em> or even how to <em>decide</em>.  Unfolding the implications of those factors, we arrive at what we should do. All together, this allows us to imbue the AI with the  necessary concepts to determine and do what we should program it to do.</p><blockquote>See the open source code and commentary at <a href=""http://www.metaethical.ai/"">www.metaethical.ai</a></blockquote><h2>Motivation</h2><p>Researchers  like Eliezer Yudkowsky and Nick Bostrom, among others, have argued for the urgent need to develop a rigorous framework for ensuring that smarter-than-human intelligence will be beneficial for humanity. I think of them and the community around their respective nonprofits, the <a href=""https://intelligence.org/"">Machine Intelligence Research Institute</a> and the <a href=""https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/"">Oxford Future of Humanity Institute</a>, as tending to share a cluster of views, including the following:</p><ul><li>We should have a wide probability distribution over when human-level AI will be developed. If we go by <a href=""https://nickbostrom.com/papers/survey.pdf"">expert predictions</a>, most predict it will arrive within this century. A cautionary approach should prepare for even more rapid timelines.</li><li>Once AI that is at least as intelligent as its human creators has been developed, there is a <a href=""http://consc.net/papers/singularity.pdf"">positive feedback loop</a>  in which it can take over the task of improving its own intelligence, quickly resulting in a superintelligence vastly greater than that of  humans.</li><li>A silicon-based intelligence will have <a href=""https://intelligence.org/files/IEM.pdf"">many natural advantages</a>  that would further compound this process, e.g. ease of faithful  replication, readily available additional hardware, already million-fold  increase in serial computational speed relative to biological neurons,  long-term exponential Moore&#x2019;s law trend as well as realistic plans and  models for its continuation.</li><li>Virtually any sufficiently advanced intelligence will <a href=""https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4618/cbdfd7dada7f61b706e4397d4e5952b5c9a0.pdf"">converge upon certain instrumental goals</a> to persist and acquire more resources and power, if only to better serve whatever intrinsic goals it may have.</li><li>There is <a href=""https://nickbostrom.com/superintelligentwill.pdf"">no automatic guarantee</a>  that greater intelligence coincides with better ethics. There is also tremendous economic incentive to develop ever smarter AI but not  necessarily to make it safer or beneficial in the long run. If anything,  each private party&#x2019;s incentive may be to <a href=""https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/Racing-to-the-precipice-a-model-of-artificial-intelligence-development.pdf"">cut corners on safety</a> to get to market quicker.</li><li>Many naive approaches to aligning AI with our values fail. Human values have a great deal of <a href=""https://intelligence.org/files/ComplexValues.pdf"">hidden complexity and missing just one dimension</a> can lead to very undesirable outcomes. Therefore, a <em>metaethical </em>approach seems to be more promising than hoping to capture all ethical principles at the object level.</li></ul><p>My own inquiry into metaethics began long before these ideas were written.  In fact, I had even reached a point where I felt I could explain my <a href=""http://www.metaethical.ai/norm_descriptivism.pdf"">reductionist metaethics</a>  to other philosophers. But having followed the development of the AI safety literature with great interest, I felt a renewed sense of purpose and urgency. It seemed we&#x2019;ll need to not only solve perennial  philosophical problems but do so with sufficient precision to make a <em>computer</em> understand them. What is more, it looked like we were in a race to accomplish it all before the arguably exponential advancement in AI crossed some unknown threshold.</p><p>Having mentioned all this, I will not be arguing for the above claims here. And while this forms <em>my </em>primary motivation, I actually don&#x2019;t think agreement with any of them is  necessary to appreciate the metaethics and metasemantics I develop here.  I have spent enough time in academic philosophy to appreciate such  theories in the theoretical spirit in which they have often been  developed. Formulating them in code as I have done could be seen as just a notational variant to the more conventional expression of certain  rigorous philosophical theories in mathematical logic. Doing so helps us avoid misleading vagueness and ambiguity and ensures maximal precision  in our thinking and communicating, all of which can be appreciated without regard to any practical applications.</p><p>Still, I hope many of you have already or will soon come to appreciate some of the backdrop of this MIRI<strong>&#x2013;</strong>FHI cluster of views. It&#x2019;s said that necessity is the mother of invention.  It has certainly driven me to be more ambitious and aim for higher  precision than I thought possible in philosophy. To have any hope of  success, I realized I would need to delve into mathematics and computer science and bridge the conceptual divide. In doing so, I was excited to discover new inspiration and draw connections I doubt I would have made  otherwise. And taking on an engineering mindset, I found myself pruning  search trees that initially sounded appealing but turned out not to be fruitful, while finding new appreciation for theories that shed new  light and enabled further technical progress.</p><p>While  many areas of philosophy can benefit from a more technical mindset, I think conversely many in computer science or other mathematical fields may be too eager to apply whatever technical tools they may currently have at their disposal without pausing to ponder whether a problem is  still at a philosophical stage in which important conceptual advancements must first take place. Perhaps these advancements have even been made already in academic philosophy but they are not aware of  them, while the philosophers in turn are not aware of how to formalize  them.</p><p>What  follows is a mixture of original contributions to philosophical problems, some standard or not-so-standard components borrowed from  across computer science and philosophy, and novel ways of weaving them all together. Throughout it all, I have tried my best to balance faithfulness to the subtleties of philosophical reality, the rigor of  formalizing these theories, the urgency of making and communicating this  progress, and the practicalities of engineering an initial prototype of a wildly ambitious project.</p><p>While I don&#x2019;t necessarily trust our civilization to get philosophy right, I think it is quite good at making progress on well-defined technical problems. I hope I have largely succeeded in turning the philosophical problems of getting an AI to understand and share our values into an engineering problem &#x2014; and hopefully one we can solve in time.</p><blockquote>See the open source code and commentary at <a href=""http://www.metaethical.ai/"">www.metaethical.ai</a></blockquote><h2>An Apology</h2><p>In an ideal world, I would have accomplished the above while explaining and justifying each philosophical step up to the standards of contemporary analytic philosophy and relating them to the current and historical literature. Moreover, on the technical side, the mathematical  formulas would be written and typeset in beautiful LaTeX with ample  diagrams and gentle tutorials.</p><p>Or you know, I could have at least written it in English. Instead, I chose  to write it in a little known programming language called setlX  (although I&#x2019;ve since interspersed the code with considerable  philosophical comments). My choice at the time and perhaps even now, was on the one hand, to struggle with writing math with limited experience  or institutional support. Or on the other hand, I could leverage my long  experience and intuition with programming to write essentially the same  content in a language with clear semantics in set theory &#x2014; the classic lingua franca of mathematics. On top of that, I&#x2019;d have a compiler to check for bugs and an interactive console serving as a concrete interface by which to manipulate very abstract objects and functions.</p><p>In further defense of setlX, I find it to be a very elegant and powerful language. Its relatively few primitives are sufficient to concisely construct complex data and algorithms while being small enough to <a href=""http://www.metaethical.ai/v19-10/#setlx-cheat_sheet"">pick up fairly quickly</a> if you have some experience with programming, mathematics or logic. Not surprisingly, writing in it feels like you&#x2019;re programming close to the mathematical essence.</p><p>Despite its initial unfamiliarity, I hope you will give setlX, my code and my  commentary a chance. Even if you are not technically inclined, I expect that with a little patience, a synopsis can be gleaned from the comments &#x2014; the most important of which I&#x2019;ve gathered into a Key Concepts outline beside the code. Other than that, I have not imposed much of an ordering but tried to enable a more free exploration by hyperlinking procedure calls to that procedure&#x2019;s definition, which often has at least a short explanatory comment.</p><p>Where I have left important explanations and justifications sparse, I&#x2019;ve tried to include links to those of others who have likely done a better job than I would have. I wish I could have done more but I have mainly been optimizing for solving the problem rather than communicating the solution.</p><blockquote>See the open source code and commentary at <a href=""http://www.metaethical.ai/"">www.metaethical.ai</a></blockquote>",June Ku,june-ku,June Ku,

They show the actual cause-and-effect process which computes the result; conceptually they represent the <em>computation</em> rather than a black-box <em>function</em>.</blockquote><p>I&apos;m new to a lot of this, but to me this seemed like a <em>weird</em> and <em>surprising</em> way to think about math (e.g. the notion that the input <span><style>.mjx-chtml {display: inline-block; line-height: 0; text-indent: 0; text-align: left; text-transform: none; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 100%; font-size-adjust: none; letter-spacing: normal; word-wrap: normal; word-spacing: normal; white-space: nowrap; float: none; direction: ltr; max-width: none; max-height: none; min-width: 0; min-height: 0; border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 1px 0}

That post claims:</p><blockquote>Even if we are very careful about how we deploy ML, we may reach the point where a small number of correlated failures could quickly become catastrophic... I think the long-term safety of ML systems requires being able to rule out this kind of behavior, which I&#x2019;ll call <em>unacceptable</em>, even for inputs which are extremely rare on the input distribution.</blockquote><p>Paul then proposes a procedure built around <em>adversarial search</em>, where one part of the system searches for inputs that produce unacceptable outputs in the trained agent, and talks more about how one might build such a system.</p><p>Evan&apos;s post tries to make progress on finding a good notion of <em>acceptable</em> behaviour from an ML system. Paul&apos;s post offers two conditions about the ease<em> </em>of <em>choosing an acceptable action</em> (in particular, that it should not stop the agent achieving a high <em>average</em> reward and that is shouldn&apos;t make hard problems much harder), but Evan&apos;s conditions are about the ease of <em>training an acceptable model</em>. His two conditions are:</p><ol><li>It must be not that hard for an amplified overseer to verify that a model is acceptable.</li><li>It must be not that hard to find such an acceptable model during training.</li></ol><blockquote>If you want to be able to do some form of informed oversight to produce an acceptable model, however, these are some of the most important conditions to pay attention to. Thus, I generally think about choosing an acceptability condition as trying to answer the question: <em>what is the easiest-to-train-and-verify property such that all models that satisfy that property (and achieve high average reward) are safe?</em></blockquote><p>The post then explores two possible approaches, act-based corrigibility and indifference corrigibility.</p><p>3) <strong><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/YuTinYEzsyHmPoocw/p/ENEYeeyPXyuEQdtZy"">Logical Optimizers</a></strong> <em>by Donald Hobson</em></p><p>This approach offers a solution to a simpler version of the FAI problem:</p><blockquote>Suppose I was handed a hypercomputer and allowed to run code on it without worrying about mindcrime, then the hypercomputer is removed, allowing me to keep 1Gb of data from the computations. Then I am handed a magic human utility function, as code on a memory stick. [The approach below] would allow me to use the situation to make a FAI.</blockquote><p>4) <strong><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/YuTinYEzsyHmPoocw/p/ZigRhB4pAGdr6beQh"">Deconfuse Yourself about Agency</a></strong> <em>by VojtaKovarik</em></p><p>This post offers some cute formalisations, for example, generalising the notion of anthropomorphism to <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""A(&#x398;)""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">A</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">(</span></span><span class=""mjx-texatom""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">&#x398;</span></span></span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">)</span></span></span></span></span></span>-morphization, about morphing/modelling any system by using an alternative architecture <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""A(&#x398;)""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">A</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">(</span></span><span class=""mjx-texatom""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">&#x398;</span></span></span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">)</span></span></span></span></span></span>. </p><p>This is an attempt to remove the need to explicitly use the term &apos;agency&apos; in conversation, out of a sense that the use of the word is lacking in substance.

G7HgP9KTWAMSv6oEJ,Bets and updating,bets-and-updating,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/G7HgP9KTWAMSv6oEJ/bets-and-updating,2019-10-07T23:06:18.778Z,32,14,5,False,False,,"<p>Suppose  the US presidential election is tomorrow.
You currently assign a probability of 50% to each outcome. (We are ignoring the small possibility that neither of the main party candidates will win).</p>
<p>A man approaches you, and offers you a bet of $10, at 2-1 odds. In other words, if candidate one wins, he pays you $20, if candidate two wins, you pay him $10.</p>
<p>Should you accept this bet? What if the bet was for $10000 instead?
Assume that your utility is linear in dollars (or assume that the bet is for utilons instead, whatever). If not, why not? Try to think about this before reading on.</p>
<p>The answer is that it depends on your priors - in particular, it depends on how you interpret the evidence of being offered the bet. In general, if someone offers you a large bet on some outcome, it's probably safe to assume they have access to a reasonable amount of information about the outcome. Depending on how much information your own probability estimate is based on, you should update towards the odds they offered you.</p>
<p>If you update too little, and accept too many bets, you will lose a lot of money to people with better information than you. On the other hand, you can also go too far in the other direction. If your response to being offered a five-cent bet is to immediately update to accept their probabilities (and refuse the bet), you will be very easy to fool (although hard to exploit by betting).</p>
<hr>
<p>Now suppose there are two superintelligences, Omega and Omicron.
They are both excellent at modelling both you and the presidential election.
Omega has a strong preference for money, and a weak preference for having you believe false things about the presidential election.
Omicron has this swapped - it wants you to believe that actual outcome of the election (which it has predicted) is extremely unlikely, and has a weak preference for money.</p>
<p>Omega executes the following plan: It looks through a large number of possible bets, looking for ones that will give it a lot of money (according to its predicted outcome of the election). For each of them, it predicts whether you will, if offered, take the bet, or simply update your belief to be more accurate (if the bet is such that Omega wins money, it must be ""in the correct direction""). It finds the best bet you will take (if any), and offers you this bet.</p>
<p>Omicron does a similar thing, but instead looks for bets that you <em>won't</em> take - bets which will instead cause you to update strongly in the wrong direction, and <em>not</em> take the bet (since it doesn't want to give you money). Again, it finds the best bet you <em>won't</em> take (if any) and approaches you.</p>
<p>You are approached by someone and offered a bet, although you don't know if it's Omega or Omicron. What should your policy be?</p>
<p>If you accept a bet, the bet is likely to have come from Omega, and thus be extremely costly for you. So you shouldn't take the bet.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you update strongly in the direction of the bet, it most likely came from Omicron, and this means it's probably an update in the wrong direction. So you shouldn't update.</p>
<p>This leaves you in the perplexing situation of believing that the bet is probably extremely good, but not wanting to take it.</p>

This could be very dangerous if we are building an AI to maximize the reward.</p><h2>Methinks the argument proves too much:</h2><p>My first point is that A&amp;M&#x2019;s argument probably works just as well for other uses of Occam&#x2019;s Razor. In particular it works just as well for the canonical use: finding the Laws and Initial Conditions that describe our universe!</p><p>Take a sequence of events we are trying to predict/represent with the lawlike-universe formalism, which posits C (the initial conditions) and then L() the dynamical laws, a function that takes initial conditions and extrapolates everything else from them. L(C) = E, the sequence of events/conditions/world-states we are trying to predict/represent.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> In any reasonable language, for any plausible sequence of events, we can construct &quot;degenerate&quot; initial condition + laws pairs that are almost as simple as the simplest pair.</p><ul><li>Example: The initial conditions are an empty void, but the laws say &quot;And then the sequence of events that happens is E&quot;</li><li>Example: The initial conditions are simply E, and L() doesn&#x2019;t do anything.</li></ul><p>It&#x2019;s easy to see that these examples, being constructed from E, are <em>at most </em>slightly more complex than the simplest possible pair, since they could use the simplest pair to generate E. </p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> The &quot;intended&quot; initial condition+law pair is likely to be significantly more complex than the simplest pair.</p><ul><li>Argument: It&apos;s really complicated.</li><li>Argument: The pair contains more information than the sequence of events, so it should be more complicated.</li><li>Argument: Physicists have been trying for years and haven&apos;t succeeded yet.</li></ul><p><strong>Conclusion: </strong>If we use Occam&#x2019;s Razor alone to find law-condition pairs that fit all the world&#x2019;s events, we&#x2019;ll settle on one of the degenerate ones (or something else entirely) rather than a reasonable one. This could be very dangerous if we are e.g. building an AI to do science for us and answer counterfactual questions like &#x201C;If we had posted the nuclear launch codes on the Internet, would any nukes have been launched?&#x201D;</p><p>This conclusion may actually be true, but it&#x2019;s a pretty controversial claim and I predict most philosophers of science wouldn&#x2019;t be impressed by this argument for it--even the ones who agree with the conclusion.</p><h2>Objecting to the three arguments for Step 2</h2><p>Consider the following hypothesis, which is basically equivalent to the claim A&amp;M are trying to disprove:<br><br><strong><em>Occam Sufficiency Hypothesis:</em></strong> <em>The &#x201C;Intended&#x201D; pair happens to be the simplest way to generate the policy.</em></p><p>Notice that everything in Step 1 is consistent with this hypothesis. The first degenerate pairs are constructed from the policy, so they are more complicated than the simplest way to generate it, so if that way is via the intended pair, they are more complicated (albeit only slightly) than the intended pair. </p><p>Next, notice that the three arguments in support of Step 2 don&#x2019;t really hurt this hypothesis:<br><br><strong>Re: first argument: </strong>The intended pair can be both very complex and the simplest way to generate the policy; no contradiction there. Indeed that&#x2019;s not even surprising: since the policy is generated by a massive messy neural net in an extremely diverse environment, we should expect it to be complex. What matters for our purposes is <em>not </em>how complex the intended pair is, but rather how complex it is <em>relative to the simplest possible way to generate the policy.</em> A&amp;M need to argue that the simplest possible way to generate the policy is simpler than the intended pair; arguing that the intended pair is complex is at best only half the argument.</p><p>Compare to the case of physics: Sure, the laws of physics are complex. They probably take at least a page of code to write up. And that&#x2019;s aspirational; we haven&#x2019;t even got to that point yet. But that doesn&#x2019;t mean Occam&#x2019;s Razor is insufficient to find the laws of physics.</p><p><strong>Re: second argument:</strong> The inference from &#x201C;This pair contains more information than the policy&#x201D; to &#x201C;this pair is more complex than the policy&#x201D; is fallacious. Of course the intended pair contains more information than the policy! All ways of generating the policy contain more information than it. This is because there are many ways (e.g. planner-reward pairs) to get any given policy, and thus specifying any particular way is giving you strictly more information than simply specifying the policy. </p><p>Compare to the case of physics: Even once we&#x2019;ve been given the complete history of the world (or a complete history of some arbitrarily large set of experiment-events) there will still be additional things left to specify about what the laws and initial conditions truly are. Do the laws contain a double negation in them, for example? Do they have some weird clause that creates infinite energy but only when a certain extremely rare interaction occurs that never in fact occurs? What language are the laws written in, anyway? And what about the initial conditions? Lots of things left to specify that aren&#x2019;t determined by the complete history of the world. Yet this does not mean that the Laws + Initial Conditions are more complex than the complete history of the world, and it certainly doesn&#x2019;t mean we&#x2019;ll be led astray if we believe in the Laws+Conditions pair that is simplest.</p><p><strong>Re: third argument: </strong>Yes, people have been trying to find planner-reward pairs to explain human behavior for many years, and yes, no one has managed to build a simple algorithm to do it yet. Instead we rely on all sorts of implicit and intuitive heuristics, and we still don&#x2019;t succeed fully. <em>But all of this can be said about Physics too</em>. It&#x2019;s not like physicists are literally following the Occam&#x2019;s Razor algorithm--iterating through all possible Law+Condition pairs in order from simplest to most complex and checking each one to see if it outputs a universe consistent with all our observations. And moreover, physicists haven&#x2019;t succeeded fully either. Nevertheless, many of us are still confident that Occam&#x2019;s Razor is in principle sufficient: If we were to follow the algorithm exactly, with enough data and compute, we would eventually settle on a Law+Condition pair that accurately describes reality, and it would be the true pair. Again, maybe we are wrong about that, but the arguments A&amp;M have given so far aren&#x2019;t convincing.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Perhaps Occam&#x2019;s Razor is insufficient after all. (Indeed I suspect as much, for reasons I&#x2019;ll sketch in the appendix) But as far as I can tell, A&amp;M&#x2019;s arguments are at best very weak evidence against the sufficiency of Occam&#x2019;s Razor for inferring human preferences, and moreover they work pretty much just as well against the canonical use of Occam&#x2019;s Razor too.</p><p>This is a bold claim, so I won&#x2019;t be surprised if it turns out I was confused. I look forward to hearing people&#x2019;s feedback. Thanks in advance! And thanks especially to Armstrong and Mindermann if they take the time to reply.</p><br><p><em>Many thanks to Ramana Kumar for hearing me out about this a while ago when we read the paper together.</em></p><br><h2>Appendix: So, is Occam&#x2019;s Razor sufficient or not?<br><br></h2><p>--A priori, we should expect something more like a speed prior to be appropriate for identifying the mechanisms of a finite mind, rather than a pure complexity prior. </p><p>--Sure enough, we can think of scenarios in which e.g. a deterministic universe with somewhat simple laws develops consequentialists who run massive simulations including of our universe and then write down Daniel&#x2019;s policy in flaming letters somewhere, such that the algorithm &#x201C;Run this deterministic universe until you find big flaming letters, then read out that policy&#x201D; becomes a very simple way to generate Daniel&#x2019;s policy. (This is basically just the &#x201C;Universal Prior is Malign&#x201D; idea applied in a new way.)</p><p>--So yeah, pure complexity prior is probably not good. But maybe a speed prior would work, or something like it. Or maybe not. I don&#x2019;t know. </p><p>--One case that seems useful to me: Suppose we are considering two explanations of someone&#x2019;s behavior: (A) They desire the well-being of the poor, but [insert epicycles here to explain why they aren&#x2019;t donating much, are donating conspicuously, are donating ineffectively] and (B) They desire their peers (and their selves) to <em>believe </em>that they desire the well-being of the poor. Thanks to the epicycles in (A), both theories fit the data equally well. But theory B is much more simple. Do we conclude that this person really does desire the well-being of the poor, or not? If we think that even though (A) is more complex it is also more accurate, then yeah it seems like Occam&#x2019;s Razor is insufficient to infer human preferences. But if we instead think &#x201C;Yeah, this person just really doesn&#x2019;t care, and the proof is how much simpler B is than A&#x201D; then it seems we really are using something like Occam&#x2019;s Razor to infer human preferences. Of course, this is just one case, so the only way it could prove anything is as a counterexample. To me it doesn&#x2019;t seem like a counterexample to Occam&#x2019;s sufficiency, but I could perhaps be convinced to change my mind about that.</p><p>--Also, I&apos;m pretty sure that once we have better theories of the brain and mind, we&#x2019;ll have new concepts and theoretical posits to explain human behavior. (e.g. something something Karl Friston something something free energy?) Thus, the simplest generator of a given human&#x2019;s behavior will probably not divide <em>automatically</em> into a planner and a reward; it&#x2019;ll probably have many components and there will be debates about which components the AI should be faithful to (dub these components the reward) and which components the AI should seek to surpass (dub these components the planner.) These debates may be intractable, turning on subjective and/or philosophical considerations. So this is another sense in which I think yeah, definitely Occam&#x2019;s Razor isn&#x2019;t sufficient--for we will also need to have a philosophical debate about what rationality is. </p>",daniel-kokotajlo,daniel-kokotajlo,Daniel Kokotajlo,

(The mathematical term for ""fundamentally the same but different on the surface"" is <em>isomorphic</em>.)</p><p>When you studied sentence structure back in grammar school (it wasn't just me, right?) you learned to break down sentences into their <em>parts of speech</em>. You learn that nouns are persons, places, or things, and verbs are the activities that nouns do. Adjectives describe nouns, and adverbs describe pretty much anything. Prepositions tell you where nouns go.  Etc.</p><p>Parts of speech are really <em>abstract</em> and really <em>general</em>. When you look at the surface, the sentence</p><p><em>the ant crawls on the ground</em></p><p>and the sentence</p><p><em>the spaceship flies through space</em></p><p>could not possibly be more different. But when you look at the sentence structure, they're nearly identical.</p><p>The concept of ""parts of speech"" emerge when we notice certain general patterns arising in the way we speak. We notice that whether we're talking about ants or spaceships, we're always talking about <em>things</em>. And whether we're talking about crawling or flying, we're always talking about <em>actions</em>.</p><p>And so on for adjectives, adverbs, conjunctions, etc., which always seem to relate back to nouns and verbs—adjectives modify nouns, for example.</p><p>Next we simply give things and actions, descriptors and relational terms some confusing names to make sure the peons can't catch on—nouns and verbs, adjectives and prepositions—and we have a way of breaking down <em>any English sentence </em>into its <em>fundamental parts</em>.</p><p>That is to say, if you know the abstract rules governing sentence structure—the types of pieces and their connections—you can come up with structures that <em>any English sentence </em>is but a <em>particular example of</em>.</p><p>Like how ""Alice pushes Bob"" is but a particular example of ""Noun verb noun.""</p><p>At the most basic level, category theory breaks down mathematics into its parts of speech. It turns out that mathematics is pretty much just nouns and verbs at its simplest—just like how, if you read between the lines a bit, any English sentence can be boiled down to its nouns and verbs. Those are the ""main players"" which everything else just modifies in some fashion.</p><p>In mathematics, a noun is called an <em>object</em>. </p><p>A verb is called a <em>morphism</em> or <em>arrow</em>. We'll explore the terminology of morphism a bit more next time. As to why they can also be called arrows, that's because verbs appear to have directions: One noun does the verb, and another noun (potentially the same noun, like pinching yourself) receives the verb. So you could draw that as an arrow like so:</p><div><span class=""mjx-chtml MJXc-display"" style=""text-align: center;""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""{\color{red}A}{\color{red}l}{\color{red}i}{\color{red}c}{\color{red}e} \;{\color{orange}{\xrightarrow {push}} }\; {\color{red}B}{\color{red}o}{\color{red}b}.""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-texatom""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mstyle"" style=""color: red;""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">A</span></span></span></span></span></span><span class=""mjx-texatom""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mstyle"" style=""color: red;""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">l</span></span></span></span></span></span><span class=""mjx-texatom""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mstyle"" style=""color: red;""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">i</span></span></span></span></span></span><span class=""mjx-texatom""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mstyle"" style=""color: red;""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">c</span></span></span></span></span></span><span class=""mjx-texatom""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mstyle"" style=""color: red;""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">e</span></span></span></span></span></span><span class=""mjx-mspace"" style=""width: 0.278em; height: 0px;""></span><span class=""mjx-texatom""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mstyle"" style=""color: orange;""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-munderover""><span class=""mjx-stack""><span class=""mjx-over"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; padding-bottom: 0.157em; padding-top: 0.141em;""><span class=""mjx-mpadded"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-block"" style=""width: 0px; margin-top: -0.281em; padding: 0px 2.731em 0.219em 0px;""><span class=""mjx-box"" style=""width: 0px; margin: -0.719em 0px -0.219em; position: relative; top: -0.15em; left: 0.278em;""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.446em;"">p</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">u</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">s</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">h</span></span></span></span><span class=""mjx-strut""></span></span></span></span><span class=""mjx-op""><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-delim-h""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.222em; padding-bottom: 0.35em; margin: 0px -0.084em 0px -0.084em;"">−</span><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.222em; padding-bottom: 0.35em; margin: 0px 0.138em 0px -0.306em; letter-spacing: -0.511em;"">−−</span><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.222em; padding-bottom: 0.35em; margin-right: -0.056em; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"">→</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class=""mjx-mspace"" style=""width: 0.278em; height: 0px;""></span><span class=""mjx-texatom""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mstyle"" style=""color: red;""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">B</span></span></span></span></span></span><span class=""mjx-texatom""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mstyle"" style=""color: red;""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">o</span></span></span></span></span></span><span class=""mjx-texatom""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mstyle"" style=""color: red;""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">b</span></span></span></span></span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""margin-top: -0.144em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">.</span></span></span></span></span></div><p>This is exactly how we diagram objects and morphisms in category theory, with one difference: we typically use single letters in place of full names.

This leads to an <strong>inner alignment failure</strong>: the agent will take competent, highly-optimized actions in pursuit of a goal that you didn&apos;t want.</p><p>This post proposes that we empirically investigate what kinds of mesa objective functions are likely to be learned, by trying to construct mesa optimizers. To do this, we need two ingredients: first, an environment in which there are many distinct proxies that lead to good behavior on the training environment, and second, an architecture that will actually learn a model that is itself performing search, so that it has robust capabilities. Then, the experiment is simple: train the model using deep RL, and investigate its behavior off distribution to distinguish between the various possible proxy reward functions it could have learned. (The next summary has an example.)</p><p>Some desirable properties:</p><p>- The proxies should not be <em>identical</em> on the training distribution.</p><p>- There shouldn&apos;t be too many reasonable proxies, since then it would be hard to identify which proxy was learned by the neural net.</p><p>- Proxies should differ on &quot;interesting&quot; properties, such as how hard the proxy is to compute from the model&apos;s observations, so that we can figure out how a particular property influences whether the proxy will be learned by the model.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> I&apos;m very excited by this general line of research: in fact, I developed my own <u><a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G1a1XOiKoHLGpD03IZIqIatphPx5JNBE5WYMn1y3V0A/edit"">proposal</a></u> along the same lines.

I do differ in the details though. I&apos;m more interested in producing a compelling example of mesa optimization, and so I care about having a sufficiently complex environment, like Minecraft. I also don&apos;t expect there to be a &quot;part&quot; of the neural net that is actually computing the mesa objective; I simply expect that the heuristics learned by the neural net will be consistent with optimization of some proxy reward function. As a result, I&apos;m less excited about studying properties like &quot;how hard is the mesa objective to compute&quot;.</p><p><u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/AFdRGfYDWQqmkdhFq/a-simple-environment-for-showing-mesa-misalignment"">A simple environment for showing mesa misalignment</a></u> <em>(Matthew Barnett)</em> (summarized by Rohin): This post proposes a concrete environment in which we can run the experiments suggested in the previous post. The environment is a maze which contains keys and chests. The true objective is to open chests, but opening a chest requires you to already have a key (and uses up the key). During training, there will be far fewer keys than chests, and so we would expect the learned model to develop an &quot;urge&quot; to pick up keys. If we then test it in mazes with lots of keys, it would go around competently picking up keys while potentially ignoring chests, which would count as a failure of inner alignment. This predicted behavior is similar to how humans developed an &quot;urge&quot; for food because food was scarce in the ancestral environment, even though now food is abundant.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> While I would prefer a more complex environment to make a more compelling case that this will be a problem in realistic environments, I do think that this would be a great environment to start testing in. In general, I like the pattern of &quot;the true objective is Y, but during training you need to do X to get Y&quot;: it seems particularly likely that even current systems would learn to competently pursue X in such a situation.</p><h1><strong>Technical AI alignment</strong></h1><h3><strong>Iterated amplification</strong></h3><p><u><a href=""https://owainevans.github.io/pdfs/evans_ida_projects.pdf"">Machine Learning Projects on IDA</a></u> <em>(Owain Evans et al)</em> (summarized by Nicholas): This document describes three suggested projects building on Iterated Distillation and Amplification (IDA), a method for training ML systems while preserving alignment. The first project is to apply IDA to solving mathematical problems. The second is to apply IDA to neural program interpretation, the problem of replicating the internal behavior of other programs as well as their outputs. The third is to experiment with adaptive computation where computational power is directed to where it is most useful. For each project, they also include motivation, directions, and related work.</p><p><strong>Nicholas&apos;s opinion:</strong> Figuring out an interesting and useful project to work on is one of the major challenges of any research project, and it may require a distinct skill set from the project&apos;s implementation. As a result, I appreciate the authors enabling other researchers to jump straight into solving the problems. Given how detailed the motivation, instructions, and related work are, this document strikes me as an excellent way for someone to begin her first research project on IDA or AI safety more broadly. Additionally, while there are <u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.08575"">many</a></u> <u><a href=""https://ai-alignment.com/iterated-distillation-and-amplification-157debfd1616"">public</a></u> <u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/EmDuGeRw749sD3GKd"">explanations</a></u> of IDA, I found this to be one of the most clear and complete descriptions I have read.</p><p><strong>Read more:</strong> <u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/Y9xD78kufNsF7wL6f/machine-learning-projects-on-ida"">Alignment Forum summary post</a></u></p><p><u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/FdfzFcRvqLf4k5eoQ/list-of-resolved-confusions-about-ida"">List of resolved confusions about IDA</a></u> <em>(Wei Dai)</em> (summarized by Rohin): This is a useful post clarifying some of the terms around IDA. I&apos;m not summarizing it because each point is already quite short.</p><h3><strong>Mesa optimization</strong></h3><p><u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/uSdPa9nrSgmXCtdKN/concrete-experiments-in-inner-alignment"">Concrete experiments in inner alignment</a></u> <em>(Evan Hubinger)</em> (summarized by Matthew): While the highlighted posts above go into detail about one particular experiment that could clarify the <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/r9tYkB2a8Fp4DN8yB/p/pL56xPoniLvtMDQ4J"">inner alignment problem</a></u>, this post briefly lays out several experiments that could be useful. One example experiment is giving an RL trained agent direct access to its reward as part of its observation. During testing, we could try putting the model in a confusing situation by altering its observed reward so that it doesn&apos;t match the real one. The hope is that we could gain insight into when RL trained agents internally represent &apos;goals&apos; and how they relate to the environment, if they do at all. You&apos;ll have to read the post to see all the experiments.</p><p><strong>Matthew&apos;s opinion:</strong> I&apos;m currently convinced that doing empirical work right now will help us understand <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/q2rCMHNXazALgQpGH/conditions-for-mesa-optimization"">mesa optimization</a></u>, and this was one of the posts that lead me to that conclusion. I&apos;m still a bit skeptical that current techniques are sufficient to demonstrate the type of powerful learned search algorithms which could characterize the worst outcomes for failures in inner alignment. Regardless, I think at this point classifying failure modes is quite beneficial, and conducting tests like the ones in this post will make that a lot easier.</p><h3><strong>Learning human intent</strong></h3><p><u><a href=""https://openai.com/blog/fine-tuning-gpt-2/"">Fine-Tuning GPT-2 from Human Preferences</a></u> <em>(Daniel M. Ziegler et al)</em> (summarized by Sudhanshu): This blog post and its <u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.08593"">associated paper</a></u> describes the results of several text generation/continuation experiments, where human feedback on initial/older samples was used in the form of a reinforcement learning reward signal to finetune the base 774-million parameter <u><a href=""https://blog.openai.com/better-language-models/"">GPT-2 language model</a></u> (<u><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/c48f996a5db5/alignment-newsletter-46"">AN #46</a></u>). The key motivation here was to understand whether interactions with humans can help algorithms better learn and adapt to human preferences in natural language generation tasks.</p><p>They report mixed results. For the tasks of continuing text with positive sentiment or physically descriptive language, they report improved performance above the baseline (as assessed by external examiners) after fine-tuning on only 5,000 human judgments of samples generated from the base model. The summarization task required 60,000 samples of <em>online</em> human feedback to perform similarly to a simple baseline, lead-3 - which returns the first three sentences as the summary - as assessed by humans.</p><p>Some of the lessons learned while performing this research include 1) the need for better, less ambiguous tasks and labelling protocols for sourcing higher quality annotations, and 2) a reminder that &quot;bugs can optimize for bad behaviour&quot;, as a sign error propagated through the training process to generate &quot;not gibberish but maximally bad output&quot;. The work concludes on the note that it is a step towards scalable AI alignment methods such as debate and amplification.</p><p><strong>Sudhanshu&apos;s opinion:</strong> It is good to see research on mainstream NLProc/ML tasks that includes discussions on challenges, failure modes and relevance to the broader motivating goals of AI research.</p><p>The work opens up interesting avenues within OpenAI&apos;s alignment agenda, for example learning a diversity of preferences (A OR B), or a hierarchy of preferences (A AND B) sequentially without catastrophic forgetting.</p><p>In order to scale, we would want to generate automated labelers through semi-supervised reinforcement learning, to derive the most gains from every piece of human input. The robustness of this needs further empirical and conceptual investigation before we can be confident that such a system can work to form a hierarchy of learners, e.g. in amplification.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> One thing I particularly like here is that the evaluation is done by humans. This seems significantly more robust as an evaluation metric than any automated system we could come up with, and I hope that more people use human evaluation in the future.</p><p><strong>Read more:</strong> <u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.08593"">Paper: Fine-Tuning Language Models from Human Preferences</a></u></p><h3><strong>Preventing bad behavior</strong></h3><p><u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.02527.pdf"">Robust Change Captioning</a></u> <em>(Dong Huk Park et al)</em> (summarized by Dan H): Safe exploration requires that agents avoid disrupting their environment. Previous work, such as <u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01186"">Krakovna et al.</a></u> (<u><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/d1a19c140226/alignment-newsletter-10"">AN #10</a></u>), penalize an agent&apos;s needless side effects on the environment. For such techniques to work in the real world, agents must also <em>estimate</em> environment disruptions, side effects, and changes while not being distracted by peripheral and unaffecting changes. This paper proposes a dataset to further the study of &quot;Change Captioning,&quot; where scene changes are described by a machine learning system in natural language. That is, given before and after images, a system describes the salient change in the scene. Work on systems that can estimate changes can likely progress safe exploration.</p><h3><strong>Interpretability</strong></h3><p><u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12686"">Learning Representations by Humans, for Humans</a></u> <em>(Sophie Hilgard, Nir Rosenfeld et al)</em> (summarized by Asya): Historically, interpretability approaches have involved machines acting as <strong>experts</strong>, making decisions and generating explanations for their decisions. This paper takes a slightly different approach, instead using machines as <strong>advisers</strong> who are trying to give the best possible advice to humans, the final decision makers. Models are given input data and trained to generate visual representations based on the data that cause humans to take the best possible actions. In the main experiment in this paper, humans are tasked with deciding whether to approve or deny loans based on details of a loan application. Advising networks generate realistic-looking faces whose expressions represent multivariate information that&apos;s important for the loan decision. Humans do better when provided the facial expression &apos;advice&apos;, and furthermore can justify their decisions with analogical reasoning based on the faces, e.g. &quot;x will likely be repaid because x is similar to x&apos;, and x&apos; was repaid&quot;.</p><p><strong>Asya&apos;s opinion:</strong> This seems to me like a very plausible story for how AI systems get incorporated into human decision-making in the near-term future. I do worry that further down the line, AI systems where AIs are merely advising will get outcompeted by AI systems doing the entire decision-making process. From an interpretability perspective, it also seems to me like having &apos;advice&apos; that represents complicated multivariate data still hides a lot of reasoning that could be important if we were worried about misaligned AI. I like that the paper emphasizes having humans-in-the-loop during training and presents an effective mechanism for doing gradient descent with human choices.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> One interesting thing about this paper is its similarity to <u><a href=""https://deepmind.com/blog/article/learning-through-human-feedback"">Deep RL from Human Preferences</a></u>: it also trains a human model, that is improved over time by collecting more data from real humans. The difference is that DRLHP produces a model of the human reward function, whereas the model in this paper predicts human <em>actions</em>.</p><h1><strong>Other progress in AI</strong></h1><h3><strong>Reinforcement learning</strong></h3><p><u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00336"">The Principle of Unchanged Optimality in Reinforcement Learning Generalization</a></u> <em>(Alex Irpan and Xingyou Song)</em> (summarized by Flo): In image recognition tasks, there is usually only one label per image, such that there exists an optimal solution that maps every image to the correct label. Good generalization of a model can therefore straightforwardly be defined as a good approximation of the image-to-label mapping for previously unseen data.</p><p>In reinforcement learning, our models usually don&apos;t map environments to the optimal policy, but states in a given environment to the corresponding optimal action. The optimal action in a state can depend on the environment. This means that there is a tradeoff regarding the performance of a model in different environments.</p><p>The authors suggest the principle of unchanged optimality: in a benchmark for generalization in reinforcement learning, there should be at least one policy that is optimal for all environments in the train and test sets. With this in place, generalization does not conflict with good performance in individual environments. If the principle does not initially hold for a given set of environments, we can change that by giving the agent more information. For example, the agent could receive a parameter that indicates which environment it is currently interacting with.</p><p><strong>Flo&apos;s opinion:</strong> I am a bit torn here: On one hand, the principle makes it plausible for us to find the globally optimal solution by solving our task on a finite set of training environments. This way the generalization problem feels more well-defined and amenable to theoretical analysis, which seems useful for advancing our understanding of reinforcement learning.</p><p>On the other hand, I don&apos;t expect the principle to hold for most real-world problems. For example, in interactions with other adapting agents performance will depend on these agents&apos; policies, which can be hard to infer and change dynamically. This means that the principle of unchanged optimality won&apos;t hold without precise information about the other agent&apos;s policies, while this information can be very difficult to obtain.</p><p>More generally, with this and some of the criticism of the <u><a href=""https://deepmind.com/blog/specifying-ai-safety-problems/"">AI safety gridworlds</a></u> that framed them as an ill-defined benchmark, I am a bit worried that too much focus on very &quot;clean&quot; benchmarks might divert from issues associated with the messiness of the real world. I would have liked to see a more conditional conclusion for the paper, instead of a general principle.</p>",rohinmshah,rohinmshah,Rohin Shah,

Last year we organized a new contra dance weekend, 

<a href=""https://www.beantownstomp.com/"">Beantown Stomp</a> (<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/beantown-stomp-retrospective"">retrospective</a>).  It sold
out, and some people were frustrated that they didn't hear about it
before we went to a waitlist.  Since we're going to have a second one
(March 20-22nd, put it in your calendar!) several people have
suggested that we do a lottery this year.  Looking at last years
applications, however, I'm not so sure:



<p>

<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/beantown-stomp-2019-registrations-big.png""><img src=""https://www.jefftk.com/beantown-stomp-2019-registrations.png"" /></a>

</p>

<p>

We admitted people first-come first-served and went to waitlist at the
end of February for a weekend in late March.  Everyone who applied
before the weekend did end up getting in off the waitlist for at least
part of it, though there were also people who would have liked to come
who didn't try registering because they knew the weekend was sold out.


</p>

<p>

This year we're going to allow more people to attend, 250 instead of
200: there was no time last year where the hall was too full, and my
worries about not being able to ventilate well enough were unfounded.
So there should be less pressure on tickets, with more of them to go
around.

</p>

<p>

So instead of jumping right in with a lottery, here's what I'm
thinking: when we open registration the first 125 applications are
accepted.  Then if we get application #126 before registration has
been open for a month, we pause registration and hold a lottery for
the remaining 125 spots.  This keeps the simplicity and immediacy of
first-come first-served, unless demand is high enough that we need a
lottery.

</p>

<p>

Thoughts?  I don't know of other events that have done this: most have
stayed first-come first-served until they start seeing all their
tickets selling out right away, and then switched to a lottery.  The
hybrid proposal here is a way to get most of the benefits of both when
you don't know which situation you're in yet.

It's valuable for society that the law is interpreted consistently--for example, so we can make legal agreements and trust that judges will enforce those agreements in a way that's similar to how they enforced such agreements in the past.  This is why legal precedents exist.</p>
<p>I think one possible problem facing democracy, at least here in the US, is that incentives for judges to follow precedents aren't strong enough.  Because judges have so much flexibility in how they interpret the law, the appointment of judges has become a high-stakes political contest that our democracy wasn't designed to do robustly.  Because judges have significant leeway in sentencing, their apparent capriciousness leads people to distrust the judicial system.  Here's a proposal for fixing these problems and reducing noise in the judicial system--which could be useful, but is probably flawed and mainly just fun to think about.</p>
<p>A <a href=""https://www.ft.com/content/6149527a-25b8-11e5-bd83-71cb60e8f08c"">Keynesian beauty contest</a> is a scenario John Maynard Keynes used to describe the behavior of financial markets.  The idea is that a newspaper prints photographs of 100 faces and challenges readers to pick the 6 faces who will be picked most frequently by the readership as a whole.  The interesting thing is that choosing the faces you personally find attractive isn't a good strategy.  You're better off choosing faces which are attractive to the population at large--or, if you believe other newspaper readers are savvy, you might instead choose faces people think people think people are attracted to (and so on).</p>
<p>Let's suppose that the newspaper editor makes a mistake and happens to run the same 100 faces a second time.  You'd be a fool not to pick the six winning faces from last time!  Not only does the data show that those faces are likely to win--everyone else knows that the data shows that those faces are likely to win, and they're going to make their choices accordingly.</p>
<p>In other words, the Keynesian beauty contest is structured to incentivize predictability and conformism in one's judgments.</p>
<p>Now for fixing the judicial system.</p>
<p>Imagine if anyone who passed the bar was allowed to sign up to be a ""Keynesian beauty contest judge"" (KBCJ hereafter).  Every month, they'd be sent some legal cases to make decisions on.  Perhaps there'd be a transcript of some kind of court investigation to review, with identifying information removed.  (The KBCJs should remain anonymous too, so they would be harder to intimidate if, for example, the defendant is a mafia boss.  And they should remain unknown to each other so they can't coordinate.)  Then the KBCJs review the transcript, pronounce guilt or innocence, and if the person is thought guilty, they sentence them.  But there's a catch--they only get paid if their judgments are close enough to the average of the other KBCJs.  So just like the beauty contest participants, they have a natural incentive to look at precedent information in order to make predictable judgments.</p>
<p>Of course there are a lot of issues that would need to be worked out.  For example, the KBCJs might gradually get lazy over time.  If all the KBCJs know that all the KBCJs usually just look at the first page of the transcript to determine guilt or innocence, ignoring subsequent pages is actually the best strategy for getting paid!  To deal with this problem, maybe the KBCJs could justify why they made each decision in writing, and those justifications could be subject to random checks.  They could be limited in the number of cases they took on, and fired if their opinions deviated from the majority too often.  Maybe only publishing the final results of KBCJ decisions, and never publishing the voting numbers, could also serve as a bulwark against gradual shift.</p>
<p>Additionally, there might be cases that cover new legal ground.  In those cases, however, I'd argue that trying to squeeze the case into some sort of existing law or precedent is the wrong approach, and the right strategy is for someone to do some original thinking about what's best for society, which feels like it ought to be a different process.  Perhaps in addition to standard outcomes like ""guilty"" and ""innocent"", the KBCJs would have a new option available, ""send it to a <a href=""https://www.sortitionfoundation.org/what_is_sortition"">citizen's assembly</a>"".  If enough KBCJs voted for this option, a citizen's assembly (advised by experts) would be spun up to try &amp; figure out what to do in that kind of case.</p>
<p>Another possible objection to the KBCJ system is that it could work <em>too</em> well, and the KBCJs might faithfully continue to enforce precedents long after the population at large decided they were unjust.  One hopes that the legislative arm of the government is competent to repeal unjust laws, but it's good to build in some redundancy if that isn't the case.  Perhaps the KBCJs could also make use of the ""send it to a citizen's assembly"" option in cases where it seems obvious that a particular law could use a second look.</p>
<p>I'm also not sure about the idea of working from a transcript instead of seeing live people in front of you.  Working from a transcript has the advantage that, for example, the decisions of the KBCJs could not be influenced by the defendant's race or gender (assuming those identifying details were removed, which should be possible in many cases).  However, the KBCJs might feel their work isn't meaningful if it feels too much like shuffling papers, and they might grow cynical about their job.  I have a theory that the reason why public healthcare systems tend to work OK (compared to nationalizing most other industries) is that medical workers are intrinsically motivated to help patients, so profit incentives aren't essential.  On the other hand, very few people are intrinsically motivated by shuffling papers at a bank, and that's why state-run banks <a href=""https://imgur.com/Nicw5Kp"">don't work as well</a>.  Perhaps having the KBCJs sometimes sit down for tea with the people involved in a case after a decision is made could go a ways toward solving this problem.  To help prevent drama, maybe only one of the KBCJs would participate in the tea ritual, so the people involved wouldn't know for sure what decision that KBCJ made.</p>

But every educated person has encountered the idea of generalization, and they've seen generalizations of generalizations. In fact, category theory is very intuitive, and I don't think it necessarily benefits from relating it all as quickly as possible to more familiar fields of mathematics. Instead, you should grasp the flow of category theory itself, as its own field.</p><p>So this is (tentatively, hopefully, unless I get busy, bored, or it just doesn't work out) a series on the basics of category theory <em>without assuming you know any math</em>. I'm thinking specifically of high school seniors.</p><p>There is no schedule for the posts.  They'll just be up whenever I make them. </p><p>Why category theory? And why lesswrong?</p><p>Well, category theory is a super-general theory of everything. Rationality is also a super-general theory of everything. In fact, we'll see how category theory tells us a lot about what rationality really is, in a certain rigorous sense.</p><p>Basically...rationality comes from noticing certain general laws that seem to emerge every time you try to do something the ""right"" way. After a while, instead of focusing so much on the specifics, it starts being worth it to take a step back and study the general rules that seem to be emerging. And you start to notice that doing things the ""right"" way gets a lot easier when you <em>start</em> with the general rules and simply fill in the specifics, like how the quadratic formula makes quadratic equations a cinch to solve. </p><p><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9Yc7Pp7szcjPgPsjf/the-brain-as-a-universal-learning-machine"">Category theory gives us <em>all</em> the general rules for doing things the ""right"" way.</a></p><p>(Don't actually hold me to demonstrating this claim.)</p><p>Why should <em>you</em> be interested in category theory?</p><p>One is because category theory is going to rise in importance in the future. It offers powerful new ways of doing math and science. So get started!</p><p>Two is that category theory makes it much easier to learn the rest of math. Well, <em>maybe</em>—this is an experiment, and a big motivation for doing this. How fast and well do people learn regular math if they can just say, ""Oh, it's an adjunction"" every time they learn a new concept? </p><p>Three is that referencing homotopy type theory in conversation will make you sound cool and mysterious. </p><p>Please let me know if there's any interest in this.</p><div><style>.mjx-chtml {display: inline-block; line-height: 0; text-indent: 0; text-align: left; text-transform: none; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 100%; font-size-adjust: none; letter-spacing: normal; word-wrap: normal; word-spacing: normal; white-space: nowrap; float: none; direction: ltr; max-width: none; max-height: none; min-width: 0; min-height: 0; border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 1px 0}

It turns out that every kind of mathematics you&apos;re likely to encounter in a normal university education is just another kind of category&#x2014;group theory falls under the category of groups, topology falls under the category of topological spaces, etc.</p><p>Specifically, category theory shows that all of the highly diverse mathematical structures that we know of can be broken down into nodes and arrows between nodes. Nodes and arrows define a category in a nutshell&#x2014;plus something called composition, which basically says that if a bird can fly from Mexico to the USA to Canada, then the bird can also travel &quot;directly&quot; from Mexico to Canada in a way that is equal to the Mexico &#x2014;&gt; USA &#x2014;&gt; Canada path. (<a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/MG8Yhsxqu9JY4xRPr/mental-context-for-model-theory"">See &quot;the right to use a name&quot; section</a>.)</p><p>Breaking any and every mathematical structure down to nodes and arrows between nodes is a super-general, super-abstract way of studying mathematics. It&apos;s like trying to study Shakespeare by breaking down all of his sentences into nouns and verbs. Category theory has a reputation for being painfully abstract&#x2014;in fact, it&apos;s been called &quot;abstract nonsense&quot; by one of its founders. Because of this, it&apos;s typically recommended that you have a few mathematical structures under your belt&#x2014;algebra, groups, topology, etc.&#x2014;before studying category theory so that you have specific examples to relate the abstractions to. (It would be tough to study verbs if you didn&apos;t know about things like running and jumping!)</p><p>But while there&apos;s only so much to learn about Shakespeare by breaking &quot;to be or not to be&quot; into infinitives, conjunctions, and adverbs, it turns out that the super-general perspective of category theory is incredibly useful in concrete ways. In particular, it turns out that pretty much every cool idea in math is something called an adjoint functor&#x2014;a special construction that can only be accessed through category theory. A lot of category theorists will tell you that adjoint functors are kind of the <em>point</em> of category theory. Adjoints, or adjunction, generalizes <em>optimization itself</em>.</p><p>Then there is the Yoneda lemma, which is as deep as it is elegant and powerful. We will explore it in depth. (If this series works out.)</p><p>You might be wondering what success category theory has found in applications to the sciences. How can you even apply something so general and abstract to our highly specific and concrete reality?</p><p>Well, category theory is super general, so whenever you are studying super-general phenomena, it makes sense to think of category theory. What&apos;s a super-general phenomenon? For example, the laws of physics! They govern everything, presumably. <a href=""https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/higher+category+theory+and+physics"">If you&apos;re looking for fundamental rules that apply to everything from tiny particles to enormous planets and the complex living creatures in between, category theory immediately comes to mind. </a></p><p>Then there is biology, which less super-general, unless there really are Martians hiding from our rovers, but organisms have to survive and reproduce under wildly diverse conditions&#x2014;the planet Earth can throw a lot of stuff at you, from volcanoes to Ice Ages. <a href=""https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2007/11/category_theory_and_biology.html"">On some level, organic life clearly has the ability to adapt to all of these conditions&#x2014;and adapting the same basic thing to lots of different contexts with powerful results is basically what category theory is.</a></p><p>Definitely the biggest applied success for category theory has been in programming. I&apos;d encourage you to look up functional programming, lambda calculus, or just Google something like &quot;programming category theory.&quot; It&apos;s fascinating, though I&apos;m actually going to deemphasize the programming side of things if anything, as I don&apos;t want to distract from the fundamentals.</p><p>So what is category theory? Nothing other than the formal generalization of everything. Why should you be interested in it? Because it gives you an incredible bird&apos;s-eye view of all of mathematics, and a particular perch, adjunction, that can&apos;t be found anywhere else.</p><p>This series will be <em>very</em> slow paced relative to other introductions&#x2014;I will <em>not</em> assume you know what sets and functions are, to give just one example. If you&apos;re comfortable with math or just want to plunge into things a little more, I strongly encourage you to look up the many fantastic introductions to category theory that already exist on the Internet for free as videos, textbooks, blog posts, and papers. This is a series meant for people who either have no exposure to mathematics beyond the high school level or actively want to avoid it! (I&apos;ll put it this way: if there was a &quot;Baby Rudin&quot; for category theory, this series would be aiming to be a &quot;Fetal Rudin.&quot;)</p><p>There&apos;s no schedule for these posts, which isn&apos;t ideal for learning, but that&apos;s just the reality of how this series is going to be made. Coming up is a sequence of posts on the most basic details of defining a category, with an emphasis on developing intuition at each step.</p>",countedblessings,countedblessings,countedblessings,

<a href=""https://www.bidadance.org/"">BIDA</a> is hosting its first
advanced dance 

<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/events/2394062140916848/"">this
afternoon</a>, before our regular dance:



<p>

<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/2019-10-06--double-dance-big.png""><img src=""https://www.jefftk.com/2019-10-06--double-dance.png"" /></a>

</p>

<p>

I've been thinking a lot about it.  If you had asked me ten years ago
whether BIDA would ever do advanced dances I would probably have said
no.  A major goal with BIDA is to be welcoming, especially to
newcomers, and a dance where people aren't welcome unless they already
know how to dance seems antithetical.  So why do I think having one is
good for our community?



</p>

<p>

Over time I've gotten a better understanding of the different roles
contra dancing plays in people's lives, and a common pattern is that
someone will start coming, get excited about it, dance a lot for a
while, come less often, and then stop attending, over the course of
about five years.  The pattern is not universal, but it is pretty
common, and one driver is no longer finding contra to be as
interesting as before.  Some people stop dancing much, others move on
to more complex styles.

</p>

<p>

This is where I see an occasional advanced dance fitting in: when you
have a hall where everyone already knows how to dance the caller can
choose more interesting dances.  Or run more no-walkthroughs and spend
less time teaching.  The dancers spend less time helping people around
them learn to dance, and more time coming up with interesting
variations.  People also want to be at dances with their friends, and
if you have a pool of people who only want to come a few times a year
they'll normally not see much of each other.  But an advanced dance
can bring coordination, where many of them attend at once without a
""how about we all come to this specific dance"" discussion.  A
community where people stay involved longer is a healthier one,
and helping people maintain ties they formed dancing is good on its
own.

</p>

<p>

On the other hand, this needs to be a rare event.  Not only does it
lose its coordination power if scheduled too frequently, but if
advanced dances started to take the place of regular dances then new
people wouldn't be able to get into contra.  The thing where you can
walk in off the street and start dancing, without attending any sort
of lesson, learning entirely as you go, is one of the best things
about the dance; it's really important that we don't lose this.  So
for now this is a one-off event, but we may have others if this feels
like it's meeting a need.

It was great seeing Brian interacting with his friends and colleagues and reflecting on their shared projects. It also lined up perfectly with my Aotearoan timezone, so I uh, I actually watched the entire thing... o.o;</p><p>But I&apos;m glad I did! I&apos;ve watched much sillier streamed events! It was actually very informative.</p><p>Here are the notes I took.</p><ul><li>Comedian Rachel Bloom came by. The video call quality was terrible.</li></ul><span><figure><img src=""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EGJozyzX0AAGLlx?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:40%""></figure></span><br><ul><li>Apparently Sony funded <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYf1sR_cYw8"">a pilot</a> of a show called <em>Truth Hurts</em>. Where Brian Dunning and Shira Lazar made a fun time of testing woo. It felt a lot like Mythbusters, with a greater focus on, you know, busting myths, and mainly myths that might really matter to someone. I think I would have loved it, but obviously it didn&apos;t go into production and I don&apos;t think Sony are funding shows any more.</li><li>Archaeologist Ken Feder apparently wrote <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Archaeological-Oddities-Civilizations-Ancient-Visitors/dp/1538105969"">a book</a> about Weird archaeological sites and the eerie stories wooists tell about them. Usually these stories are something along the lines of &quot;old humans couldn&apos;t have made these artefacts, so it must have been aliens&quot;. Ken notes that this theory is actually kind of racist, the old people were very clever. He then explains the techniques by which the old people <em>did</em> make those artefacts, which tend to be very interesting.</li><li>Magician Brian Brushwood seemed to have a really good attitude about promoting rationality. He hosts something called Scam School where, if I&apos;ve gathered correctly, he teaches people how to commit acts of fooling. He says that only once you&apos;ve fooled someone yourself will you learn to spot the signs that someone is trying to fool you, and in many cases those signs will be obvious once you know what to look for. He seemed to have a lot of value to say.</li><ul><li>On this note, I recommend Penn and Teller&apos;s <em>Fool Us</em>. Magic is the study of wrong-seeing, it should be interesting to any aspiring rationalist, and Fool Us is a great place to see it.</li></ul><li>Kiki Sanford, host of the extremely long-running science news podcast <em>Scishow</em>, mentioned being a part of a show called <em>What On Earth</em>, where they&apos;d all look at some of the weird/spooky things people find in google earth, and then investigate them, sometimes going so far as to visit those locations, and find out what&apos;s really there. This sounds extremely fun to me.</li><li>Brian&apos;s special <em>Principles of Curiosity</em> was shown. It was a well polished short documentary about fundamental principles of scientific thinking, featuring the travelling stones of death valley as a central case. I hope it is/was shown in many schools, and I hope it has its intended effects.</li><li>Former psychic Mark Edward was talking about his time working at a psychics&apos; hotline (written about in <em>Psychic Blues</em>). He said that most of the people there were just cynical frauds, but he described a type of person... &quot;intuitive&quot;, those who were just &quot;telling their own truth&quot;, if I understood correctly... he was describing a type of person who passed for a psychic because they could cold-read, and they could cold-read because they <em>could see through people</em> in ways that their clients might find invasive if it weren&apos;t for the shrouds of ghosts and magic covering their shame. They&apos;d tell their audience that the reason they could see so much, wasn&apos;t because people have streams of pathos overflowing out of their orifices that they&apos;re failing to hide from anyone who truly wants to see, no no, it&apos;s because of this here comforting illusion.. <em>you</em> have a guardian angel in the spirit realm and it is speaking to me now because it trusts me, now, here&apos;s how your angel says we can fix your problem, and improve your life. Again, I&apos;m not giving this advice, no, far be it from me to give you advice, it&apos;s the angel. You have no reason to feel embarrassed, I&apos;m not telling you incredibly basic things that anyone ought to know, these are esoteric predictions from the spirit realm. Now, that ought to cure your troubles. I hope you don&apos;t need to call me again, but if you do, I&apos;ll always be here.</li><ul><li>And I wept for a bit. The notion that there are these great souls who see so much more <em>human truth</em> than anyone could believe or accept, that they feel like the only way they can convey any of it is to cast these digestible illusions for us... I can believe it. I&apos;ve got friends like that, and there&apos;s nothing a-priori unlikely about it. Some people, often through trauma, end up having a lot of introspection forced upon them. Being forced at an early age to look into dark places, lose someone when they&apos;re young, contend with monsters, or maybe mental illness visits them, and they have to sear their whole psyche with light. And sometimes those people take all of that strength and direct it towards helping the people around them.</li><li>But idk I should read the book</li></ul></ul><br><p>Overall it was a lovely, awkward, interesting time, and Brian will probably never do it again. Here&apos;s to another 13 years!</p>",MakoYass,mako-yass,mako yass,

Some people are color-blind. This deficiency can be objectively demonstrated by tasks such as the Ishihara patterns. Some people cannot smell, and sometimes do not discover this until well into adulthood. Some people cannot form mental imagery, which was undiscovered until Galton wrote of it, but is now well-known enough to have a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphantasia"">Wikipedia article</a>.

So I shall try to describe the experience. I have a vivid sensation of my own presence, my own self. This is the thing I am pointing at when I say that I am conscious. Whether I sit in meditation or in the midst of life, there I am. Indeed, more vividly in meditation, because then, that is where I direct my attention. But only in dreamless sleep is it absent.</p><p>Some people claim by meditation to have seen through what they claim is the illusion of consciousness. I am uncertain whether they have self-modified to ablate the faculty of having this experience, or merely philosophised themselves into believing there can&apos;t be any such thing, and insisting that they are not experiencing what they are experiencing.</p><p>But there may be some people out there who have never had any experience of themselves such as I have described. In effect, almost p-zombies. The original p-zombies are by definition indistinguishable in behaviour from everyone else, including talk about consciousness. But people without this experience of self, quasi-p-zombies, or q-zombies for short, may imitate the discourse as aphantasics or anosmics may, but without real understanding. <strong>I invite anyone who recognises themselves to be a q-zombie to put their hand up.</strong> Note that this is a question about whether you actually have this experience, not what you think about its possibility or nature.<br></p>",Richard_Kennaway,richard_kennaway,Richard_Kennaway,

When Lily was little we used an 

<a href=""https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B00P76URH8"">analog rotary timer
outlet</a> to turn on a light so she would know when it was ok to get
up.  The goal wasn't to wake her, but to let her know when it was ok
to come downstairs.  This worked ok, but it wasn't very precise.  It
was good to maybe the nearest 15min, and would drift.



<p>

As she got better at reading we switched to a clock, and taught her
that when the first digit was ""8"" she could get up:

</p>

<p>

<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/lily-clock-eight-big.jpg""><img src=""https://www.jefftk.com/lily-clock-eight.jpg"" /></a>
<br />
<i>pictured: a clock that is not saying ""time to get up""</i>

</p>

<p>

This worked pretty well, but as she got close to starting kindergarten
we needed to move her bedtime and waketime earlier.  We did this
gradually, about 15min at a time, over the course of a couple weeks.
Since she can't tell time yet and was only reading the most
significant digit she wasn't going to be able to learn that 7:45, then
7:30, then 7:15, etc meant time to get up.  So I did the easy thing,
and started setting her clock early.  First fifteen minutes fast, then
thirty minutes fast, until eventually it was an hour fast.

</p>

<p>

It's now the first week of school and her clock reads ""8:00"" at 7am.
At this point switching it to the correct time and teaching her she
can get up if it is ""7:??"" would have made sense, but there was enough
going on that we didn't get to it.

</p>

<p>

Now we're a month in, she's gotten faster with her morning routine,
and she could be sleeping later.  So I've pushed her clock to only be
48 minutes fast instead of an hour, and it reads ""8:00"" at 7:12am.

</p>

<p>

All of this is pretty silly: she's pretty close to learning to tell
time, and having one clock in the house that doesn't match the others
is going to start confusing her.  And it already confuses adults
sometimes (mostly me) since who expects a clock to be 48min fast?

</p>

<p>

On the other hand I'm not sure where to go next.  I could just leave
things alone until she points out that it's weird, at which point
she'll know time well enough that I can set it correctly and suggest
she not get up before 7:12am.  Or I could get a <a href=""https://smile.amazon.com/FosPower-Electrical-Outlets-Programmable-Capacity/dp/B07958YD8R/"">more
accurate outlet timer</a>, which would have the benefit of also
working for our younger daughter?  Not sure yet.

</p>

(When we were little we had analog clocks in the house, and my dad
made a wooden demonstration clock for us.  When the hands on the real
clock matched the hands on the wooden clock, it was time to get up.  I
think this worked well, though I remember one weekend when my youngest
sister seemed to sleep a really long time, and it turned out she had
slept past her normal waking time of 7am and so was still waiting for
the hands to come around again.)

ZRHLrw4S5P2NYcw3n,Ideal Number of Parents,ideal-number-of-parents,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ZRHLrw4S5P2NYcw3n/ideal-number-of-parents,2019-10-04T20:00:01.371Z,20,11,4,False,False,,"<p>

I'll often hear people say with varying levels of seriousness that the
ideal number of parents to have is something large, like maybe
five. Children, <a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/baby-time-inequality"">especially
infants</a>, can be an enormous amount of work, which is certainly
easier spread out among more people.  Kids also like getting a lot of
attention, can require a lot of money, and, since different adults are
good with kids in different ways, can benefit from having a range of
adults in their lives.  But while having many people involved in
taking care of the kids is great, I'm not sure having all of them be
co-equal parents is a good approach.

</p><p>

First, a question: why are people excited about putting so much of
themselves into parenting, when if you wanted to pay for similar
levels of childcare it would be incredibly expensive?  Not to suggest
that parenting is simply unpaid childcare; thinking about what why
these superficially similar situations lead to such different levels
of desire helps illuminate what's important about parenting.

</p>

<p>

Answers will, of course, vary based on individual perspectives and
drives.  For some people the answer is ""I'm not excited about this,
which is why I don't want kids"", but for people who do want to be a
parent I think it's common for things to trace back through two
points:

</p>

<p>

</p>

<ul>
<li>Having a substantial say in how the child is raised.</li>
<li>Knowing that this is a life-long relationship.</li>
</ul>



<p>

For the first point, the more people you have co-parenting the less
say each one has and the harder it is to reach agreement.  Parents can
have different ideas on what is safe, how discipline should work, how
much help to give, how to do food, value of different kinds of
toys/screens/games, <a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/cosleeper"">co-sleeping</a>, <a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/baby-sleep"">night</a> <a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/baby-sleep-ii"">training</a>, potty training, is it ok to <a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/microwaving-milk-is-fine"">microwave baby milk</a>, what rules
to have <a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/on-sharing"">for sharing</a>, how structured the
day should be, when they're ready to <a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/kid-door"">go outside
alone</a>, how to do money, what to do for <a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/childcare-ii"">childcare</a>, when <a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/velcro-blackout-curtains"">bedtime should be</a>, what's
important in schooling, how important is <a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/predictable-parenting"">predictability</a>, how to handle
various unique challenges most kids have in some form, how to do <a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/present-timing-for-kids"">presents</a>, when to let them <a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/dressing-outside"">try a thing</a>, what medical treatments
make sense, how much to <a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/parenting-optional-vs-required"">let them make their own
decisions</a>, whether to let them <a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/they-might-say-no"">ask
people for things when it's kind of rude</a>, how much to push them,
when to <a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/candy-for-nets"">encourage an interest</a>, how to
build responsibility, and how to balance all kinds of tricky
tradeoffs.

</p>

<p>

For important issues having more people involved in the decision could
make it more likely you are to get good decisions, but you need to
balance this against how hard it is to get people to come to agreement
on things they feel very strongly about.  Unless all the parents have
an incredibly close sense of how kids should be raised there will be
a lot of these, based on different childhood experience, different
parenting philosophy, how to weigh different factors, etc.  This is
hard enough with two people, and it seems like something that gets
substantially more difficult the more parents there are.

</p>

<p>

For the second point, the permanent nature of the relationship allows
a kind of parent-child bonding that people are understandably wary of
in more temporary arrangements.  I care enormously about what happens
to my kids, and part of that is knowing that they're my responsibility
no matter what.  Getting this kind of assurance of permanence with a
larger number of parents is legally somewhere between ""very difficult""
and ""not possible"" in a society where only some parents will have
official status.  The legal parent(s) could at some point, if things
fall apart, cut the others out.  If you think co-parents wouldn't do
this, consider how many loving relationships collapse into spitefests
in divorce.  Even if we fixed the legal aspect, however, the more
people you have in parental roles the more likely there is to be some
kind of falling-out over the years, and joint custody among large
numbers of households wouldn't work well.

</p>

<p>

Other aspects that could be a problem, however, seem like they could
be managed with good communication, good culture, and <a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/dividing-tasks"">dividing things</a>.  For example, I do the
kids breakfast and pack Lily's lunch in the morning (hence the <a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/thermal-mass-thermos"">thermos experimentation</a>).  I then
pay attention to what comes home uneaten in the lunchbox to try to
figure out what I should send next time. In figuring out what to send
I also pay attention to what she's been eating and not eating at
breakfast and dinner. [1] Even if we had several other co-parents we
could still divide things up so this was all on one person and avoid
having to manage this process across the full number of parents.  I do
think the ways parenting work tends to drift towards the people who
are already doing the most, because they're <a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/equal-parenting-advice-for-dads"">currently best at it</a>,
are more of an issue, but a surmountable one if you're attentive.

</p>

<p>

Overall I do think something with more parents can work, and I'm
excited people are trying out new approaches.  I think it could turn
out to be really positive for children to have so many adults strongly
invested in their well-being.  But I think children having one or two
parents in a strong and stable community/household of family/friends
probably works better than a larger number of fully-equal parents.

</p>

<p>
<br />

[1] I initially tried an approach of asking her each day what she
wanted for lunch, but it turns out she's pretty bad at predicting
what she's going to want to eat.  So my current strategy is that I
pack what I think she'll eat, and then if she wants me to pack
something in addition she can ask me to and I'll do that as well.  I
do eventually want to move to her packing her own lunch and getting
good at figuring out what she wants to eat, but at least for now it's
much more important to me that she be getting enough to eat.

Demonstrations are indeed incipient philosophies and sciences: how good or bad a demonstration is determines how good or bad will be the system of philosophy and the thoughts that follow it. Now the demonstrations that we use in our whole process of getting from the •senses and •things to •axioms and conclusions are defective and inappropriate. This process has four parts, with a fault in each of them. <strong>(1)</strong> The impressions of the senses itself are faulty, for the senses omit things and deceive us. Their omissions should be made up for, and their deceptions corrected. <strong>(2)</strong> Notion are abstracted <em>badly</em> from the impressions of the senses, and are vague and confused where they should be definite and clearly bounded.</p><p><strong>(3)</strong> Induction goes wrong when it infers scientific principles by simple enumeration, and doesn’t, as it should, take account of the exceptions and distinctions that nature is entitled to. <strong>(4)</strong> The method of discovery and proof in which you <em>first</em> state the most general principles and <em>then</em> bring the intermediate axioms into the story, ‘proving’ them from the general principles, is the mother of errors and a disaster for all the sciences. At this stage I merely touch on these matters. I’ll discuss them more fully when, after performing these cleansings and purgings of the mind, I come to present the true way of interpreting nature.</p><p><strong>70.</strong> The procedure that starts with experience and <em>sticks close to it</em> is the best demonstration by far. A procedure that involves transferring a result to other cases that are judged to be similar is defective unless the transfer is made by a sound and orderly process. The way men conduct experiments these days is blind and stupid. Wandering and rambling with no settled course and only such ‘plans’ as events force on them, they cast about and touch on many matters, but don’t get far with them. Sometimes they are eager, sometimes distracted; and they always find that some further question arises. They usually conduct their experiments casually, as though this were just a game; they slightly vary experiments that are already known; and if an experiment doesn’t come off, they grow weary and give up the attempt. And even if they worked harder at their experiments, applying themselves more seriously and steadfastly, ·they <em>still</em> wouldn’t get far, because· they work away at some <em>one experiment</em>, as Gilbert did with the magnet and the chemists do with gold. That is a way of proceeding that is as unskilful as it is feeble. For no-one successfully investigates the nature of a thing taken on its own; the inquiry needs to be enlarged so as to become more general.</p><p>And even when they try to draw some science, some doctrines, from their experiments, they usually turn aside and rashly embark on premature questions of practical application; not only for the practical benefits of such applications, but also because they want to <em>do</em> things that will •assure them that it will be worth their while to go on, and •show themselves in a good light to the world and so •raise the credit of the project they are engaged in. They are behaving like Atalanta ·in the legend from ancient Greece·: she turned aside to chase a golden ball, interrupting her running of the race and letting victory slip through her fingers. But in using the true course of experience to carry out new works, we should model our behaviour on the divine wisdom and order. On the first day of creation God created light and nothing else, devoting an entire day to a work in which no material substance was created. We should follow suit: with experience of any kind, we should first try to discover true causes and axioms, looking for •enlightening experiments rather than for •practically fruitful ones. For axioms don’t <em>singly</em> prepare the way for practical applications, but <em>clusters of</em> rightly discovered and established axioms do so, bringing in their wake streams—<em>crowds</em>!—of practical works. The paths of experience are just as rocky and jammed as the paths of judgment, and I’ll discuss that later. I have mentioned ordinary experimental work at this stage only in its role as a bad kind of demonstration. But considerations of order now demand that I take up next ·two linked topics·: •the signs or omens (mentioned a little way back) that current systems of philosophy and of thought are in a bad condition; and •the causes of ·this badness, which· seems at first so strange and incredible. When you have seen •the signs you will be more likely to agree ·with me about the badness·; and my explanation of •its causes will make it seem less strange. These two together will greatly help to render the process of wiping the idols from the intellect easier and smoother. ·My discussion of •the signs will run to the end of <strong>77</strong>, and •the causes will run from there to the middle of <strong>92</strong>·.</p><p>[In the next seven sections, the Latin <em>signa</em> will be translated sometimes as ‘signs’ and sometimes as ‘omens’.]</p><p><strong>71.</strong> The sciences that we have come mostly from the Greeks. For the additions by Roman, Arabic and later writers are neither plentiful nor important, and such as they are they have been built on the foundation of Greek discoveries. Now, the wisdom of the Greeks was that of teachers of rhetoric, and it spawned disputations, which made it the worst kind of inquiry for finding the truth. Those who wanted to be thought of as philosophers contemptuously gave the label ‘sophists’ to the ancient rhetoricians Gorgias, Protagoras, Hippias and Polus; but really the label fits the whole lot of them: Plato, Aristotle, Zeno, Epicurus, Theophrastus, and their successors Chrysippus, Carneades and so on. There was this just difference: •the rhetoricians were wandering and mercenary, going from town to town, offering their wisdom for sale, and taking a price for it; whereas •the others were more ceremonial and ‘proper’—men who had settled homes, and who opened schools and taught their philosophy without charging for it. But although the two groups of philosophers were in other ways unalike, they had one thing in common: both lots were teachers of rhetoric; both turned everything into a matter for disputations, and created sects that they defended against heresies. They turned it all into •‘the talk of idle old men to ignorant youths’ (Dionysius’s jibe against Plato, a not unfair one!). But the earlier of the Greek philosophers—Empedocles, Anaxagoras, Leucippus, Democritus, Parmenides, Heraclitus, Xenophanes, Philolaus and so on (omitting Pythagoras because he was a mystic)—didn’t open schools, as far as we know. What they did was to <em>apply themselves to the discovery of truth</em>, doing this</p><ul><li>more quietly, severely and simply—that is, with less affectation and parade—</li></ul><p>than the others did. And in my judgment they also performed</p><ul><li>more successfully,</li></ul><p>·or would have done so· if it weren’t for the fact that their works were in the course of time obscured by less substantial people who offered more of what suits and pleases the capacity and tastes of the vulgar. Time is like a river, bringing lightweight floating stuff down to us and letting heavier and solider things sink. Still, not even they—·Empedocles and the rest·—were entirely free of the Greek fault: they leaned too far in the direction of ambition and vanity, founding sects and aiming for popular applause. The inquiry after •truth has no chance of succeeding when it veers off after •trifles of this kind. And I ought to mention the judgment, or rather the prediction, that an Egyptian priest made about the Greeks, namely that ‘they are always <em>boys</em>, with no •long-established knowledge and no •knowledge of ancient times’ [neater in Latin: •<em>antiquitatem scientiae</em> and •<em>scientiam antiquitatis</em>]. Assuredly they were like boys in their readiness to chatter, and in their inability to father anything—for their wisdom is full of words but sterile in works. So when we consider the currently accepted philosophy in the light of its place of origin and its family tree, the omens are not good!</p><p><strong>72.</strong> And the omens provided by the character of the time and age aren’t much better than the ones from the character of the place and the nation. For knowledge at that period concerned only a short stretch of time and a small part of the world, and that’s the worst state to be in, especially for those who base everything on experience. For the preceding thousand years they had no <em>history</em> worthy of the name, but only fables and verbal traditions. And they knew only a small portion of the regions and districts of the world; they indiscriminately called everyone to the north of them ‘Scythians’. and those to the west ‘Celts’; they knew nothing of Africa beyond the nearest part of Ethiopia, or of Asia beyond the Ganges. They knew even less about the provinces of the New World. . . .and declared to be uninhabitable a multitude of climates and zones where actually countless nations live and breathe. . . . (Contrast that with the present day: we know many parts of the New World as well as the whole of the Old World, and our stock of experience has grown infinitely.) So if like astrologers we take omens ·for contemporary systems of philosophy· from the facts about <em>when</em> they were born, we can’t predict anything great for them.</p><p><strong>73.</strong> Of all the signs ·we can have of the value of a field of endeavour·, none are more certain or more conspicuous than those based on the <em>upshots</em> ·of the endeavour·. For upshots and useful practical applications are like sponsors and guarantors of the truth of philosophies. [Throughout this work, ‘philosophies’ include ‘sciences’.] Now, from all those systems of the Greeks and the particular sciences derived from them, you can hardly name a single experiment that •points the way to some improvement in the condition of man, and that •really does come from the speculations and theories of philosophy. Hardly one, after all those years! And Celsus honestly and sensibly admits as much, when he tells us that •the practical part of medicine was discovered first, and that <em>then</em> •men philosophized about it and hunted for and assigned causes; rather than the reverse process in which •philosophy and the knowledge of causes led to •the discovery and development of the practical part. So it isn’t strange that among the Egyptians, who rewarded inventors with divine honours and sacred rites, there were more images of the lower animals than of men; for the lower animals have made many discoveries through their natural instincts, whereas men have given birth to few or none through their discussions and rational inferences.</p><p>The work of chemists has produced a little, but only •accidentally and in passing or else •by varying previous experiments (just as a mechanic might do!), and not by any skill or any theory. For the theory that they have devised does more to confuse the experiments than to help them. And the people who have busied themselves with so-called ‘natural magic’ have come up with nothing but a few trifling and apparently faked results. In religion we are warned to <em>show our faith by our works</em>; the same rule applies in philosophy, where a system should be judged by its fruits, and pronounced frivolous if it turns out to be barren, especially when it bears the thorns and thistles of dispute and contention rather than the fruits of grape and olive.</p><p><strong>74.</strong> The growth and progress of systems and sciences provides signs ·as to their value·. Something that is grounded in nature grows and increases, while what is based on opinion <em>alters</em> but doesn’t <em>grow</em>. If those doctrines ·of the ancient Greeks· hadn’t been so utterly like a plant torn up by its roots, and had remained attached to and nourished by the womb of nature, the state of affairs that we have seen to obtain for two thousand years—namely</p><p><em>the sciences stayed in the place where they began, hardly changing, not getting any additions worth mentioning, thriving best in the hands of their first founders and declining from then on</em></p><p>—would never have come about. This is the opposite of what happens with the mechanical arts, which are based on nature and the light of experience: they (as long as they find favour with people) continually thrive and grow, having a special kind of <em>spirit</em> in them, so that they are at first rough and ready, then manageable, from then onwards made smoothly convenient by use—and <em>always growing</em>.</p><p><strong>75.</strong> Admissions made by the very authorities whom men now follow constitute another sign ·that today’s sciences are in trouble·—if it is all right to apply the label ‘sign’ to what is really testimony, indeed the most reliable of all testimony. Even those who so confidently pronounce on everything do intermittently pull themselves together and complain of the subtlety of nature, the obscurity of things, and the weakness of the human mind. ·These complaints are not just a sign of trouble in the sciences; they are worded in such a way that they cause further harm·. If these people merely <em>complained</em>, some cowards might be deterred from searching further, while others with livelier minds and a more hopeful spirit might be spurred and incited to go on. But the complainers don’t merely speak for themselves: if something is beyond their knowledge or reach, and of their master’s, they declare it to be beyond the bounds of possibility, something that can’t be known or done; so that their lofty ill-nature turns the weakness of their own ‘discoveries’ into a libel against nature herself and a source of despair for the rest of the world. •Thus the school of the New Academy, which doomed men to everlasting darkness by maintaining as a matter of doctrine that nothing at all could be known. •Thus the opinion that men can’t possibly discover the <em>forms</em>, i.e. the real differentiae of things ·that put things into different species· (really they are laws of pure action [see note <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/editPost?postId=vTCzM8bTPk4ANXsY6&amp;eventForm=false#pure_actions"">here</a>]). •Thus also certain opinions in the field of action and operation, e.g. that the heat of the sun is quite different in kind from the heat of fire, so that no-one will think that the operations of fire could produce anything like the works of nature ·that are produced by the sun·. •That’s the source of the view that. . .</p><p><strong>Latin:</strong> . . . <em>compositionem tantum opus hominis, mistionem vero opus solius naturae esse</em></p><p><strong>literal meaning:</strong> . . . men are capable only of composition, and mixing has to be the work of nature</p><p><strong>intended meaning?</strong> . . . men are capable only of assembling things into physical mixtures (e.g. salt and pepper), and the subtler kind of combination involved in something’s being gold or water or salt or the like must be the work of nature</p><p>—lest men should hope to develop techniques for generating or transforming natural bodies, ·e.g. creating water or turning lead into gold·. ·I point out· this sign ·of second-rateness· to warn you not to let your work and your career get mixed up with dogmas that are not merely discouraging but are <em>dedicated</em> to discouragement.</p><p><strong>76.</strong> Here is another sign ·of something’s being wrong· that I oughtn’t to pass over: the fact that formerly there existed among philosophers such great disagreement, and such differences between one school and another. This shows well enough that the road from the senses to the intellect was not well defended ·with walls along each side·, when the same raw material for philosophy (namely the nature of things) has been taken over and used to construct so many wandering pathways of error. These days, most of the disagreements and differences of opinion on first principles and entire ·philosophical· systems have been extinguished; but there are still endless questions and disputes concerning some <em>parts</em> of philosophy, which makes it clear that there is nothing certain or sound in the systems themselves or in the modes of demonstration ·that they employ·.</p><p><strong>77.</strong> Some men think this:</p><blockquote>There ·<em>is</em> great agreement in philosophy these days, because there is· widespread agreement in assenting to the philosophy of Aristotle; as witness the fact that once it was published the systems of earlier philosophers fell into disuse and withered away, while in the times that followed nothing better was found. Thus, it seems to have been so well laid out and established that it has drawn both ages—·ancient and modern·—to itself.</blockquote><p>[[Philosophy here likely means <em>philosophy and science </em>unlike in modern usage where philosophy has been separated from science.]]</p><p>I start my reply to this by remarking that the general opinion that the old systems stopped being used or consulted when Aristotle’s works were published is <em>false</em>. In fact, long afterwards—even down to the times of Cicero and later centuries—the works of the old philosophers still remained. But in the times that followed, when the flood of barbarians pouring into the Roman empire made a shipwreck of human learning, <em>then</em> the systems of Aristotle and Plato, like planks of lighter and less solid material, floated on the waves of time and were preserved. As for the point about agreed assent: if you look into this more carefully you’ll see that the view I am discussing is wrong about that too. For genuine <em>agreement</em> is based on people’s having duly examined some matter and reached, freely ·and independently·, the same opinion about it. But the great majority of those who have assented to the philosophy of Aristotle have delivered themselves over to it on the strength of the prejudices and the authority of others; so that this is less a case of <em>agreement</em> than of <em>moving together as a crowd</em>. But even if it had been a real and widespread agreement, that is so far from being •solid confirmation of the truth ·of Aristotle’s philosophy· that it actually creates a •strong presumption of its falsity. For in intellectual matters the <em>worst</em> of all auguries is ·general· consent, except in theology (and in politics, where there is a right to vote!). This is because of something I have already mentioned: that nothing pleases the multitude unless it appeals to the imagination or ties the intellect up with knots made from the notions of the vulgar. Something that Phocion said about morals can very well be re-applied to intellectual matters, namely that if the multitude accept ·what you say· and are united in their applause, you should immediately check yourself to see where you have gone wrong. So <em>this</em> sign is one of the <em>least</em> favourable.</p><p>That brings me to the end of what I have to say to make my point that the signs of health and truth in the currently accepted philosophical systems and sciences are <em>not good</em>, whether they be drawn from their origins (<strong>71–2</strong>), their upshots (<strong>73</strong>), their progress (<strong>74</strong>), the admissions of their founders (<strong>75</strong>), or agreed acceptance (<strong>77</strong>).</p><p><strong>78.</strong> I now come to the <em>causes</em> of these errors—so many of them, and such bad ones!—that have continued on through all those centuries. ·My discussion of thirteen of them will run on through <strong>92</strong>·. You may have been wondering how the points I have made could have escaped men’s notice until now; my account of the causes should stop you wondering about that. When you understand the causes, you may have something else to be surprised by, namely the fact that someone <em>has</em> now seen through the errors, thought about them, and come up with my points against them. As for that, I see it as coming from my good luck rather than from my superior talents; it’s not that I am so clever, but rather that I was born at the right time.</p><p><strong>(1)</strong> The first point ·about how long the errors went undetected· is this: If you look hard at ‘all those centuries’ you’ll see that they shrink into something quite small. We have memories and records of twenty-five, and of those you can hardly pick out <em>six</em> that were fertile in the sciences or favourable to their development. (There are wastelands and deserts in times just as in regions of the earth!) We can properly count only <em>three</em> periods when learning flourished, and they lasted barely <em>two</em> centuries each: that of •the Greeks, the second of •the Romans, and the last among us—•the nations of western Europe. The intervening ages of the world were not flourishing or fertile for the growth of knowledge. (Don’t cite the Arabs or the schoolmen ·as counter-examples to that·; for they spent the intervening times not •adding to the weightiness of the sciences but crushing them with the weight of their books!) So there is one cause for the lack of progress in the sciences, namely the brevity of the periods that can properly be said to have been favourable to them.</p><p><strong>79.</strong> <strong>(2)</strong> Here is a second cause, and one of great all-around importance: Precisely at the times when human intelligence and learning have flourished most, or indeed flourished at all, men <em>didn’t</em> work at natural philosophy [here = ‘natural science’]. Yet it should have been regarded as the great mother of the sciences; because all arts and all sciences, though they may be polished and shaped and made fit for use, won’t <em>grow</em> at all if they are torn from this root ·of natural philosophy·. It is clear that after the Christian religion was generally accepted and grew strong, the vast majority of the best minds applied themselves to theology, that this offered the best promise of reward and the most abundant research support of all kinds, and that this focus on theology was the chief occupation ·of able people· in western Europe during the <strong>third</strong> period ·of the three I have named·—all the more so because at about the same time literacy began to be more widespread and religious controversies sprang up. During the Roman period—the <strong>second</strong> of my trio—philosophers mostly worked on and thought about moral philosophy, which was to the pagans what theology is to us. Also, in those times the best intelligences usually devoted themselves to public affairs, because the sheer size of the Roman empire required the services of a great many people. And—·moving back to the <strong>first</strong> of my trio·—there was only a tiny portion of time when natural philosophy was seen to flourish among the Greeks; for in earlier times all except Thales of the so-called ‘seven wise men’ applied themselves to morals and politics; and in later times, when Socrates had drawn philosophy from heaven down to earth, moral philosophy became more fashionable than ever and diverted men’s minds from the philosophy of nature.</p><p>And right at the time when inquiries into nature <em>were</em> carried on energetically, they were spoiled and made useless by controversies and the ambitious display of new opinions. During those three periods, then, natural philosophy was largely neglected or impeded, so it’s no wonder that men made so little progress with something that they weren’t attending to.</p><p>[This is the first of eleven remarks along the lines of ‘No wonder science hasn’t progressed, given the fact that. . . ’—one for each of Bacon’s causes of non-progress except the first and last.]</p><p><strong>80.</strong> <strong>(3)</strong> I would add that especially in recent times natural philosophy, even among those who <em>have</em> attended to it, has scarcely ever had anyone’s complete and full-time attention (except perhaps a monk studying in his cell, or an aristocrat burning the midnight oil in his country house); it has usually been treated as merely a bridge leading to something else. And so ·natural philosophy·, that great mother of the sciences, has been subjected to the astonishing indignity of being degraded to the role of a servant, having to <em>help</em> medicine or mathematics in their affairs, and to give the immature minds of teen-agers a first dip in a sort of dye, to make them better able to absorb some other dye later on. Meanwhile don’t look for much progress in the sciences—especially in their practical part—unless natural philosophy is applied to particular sciences, and particular sciences are applied back again to natural philosophy. It is because this hasn’t been done that many of the sciences have no <em>depth</em> and merely glide over the surface of things. What sciences? Well, astronomy, optics, music, many of the mechanical arts, even medicine itself—and, more surprisingly, moral and political philosophy and the logical sciences. Because once these particular sciences have become widespread and established, they are no longer nourished by natural philosophy, which could have given them fresh strength and growth drawn from the well-springs—from true thoughts about</p><ul><li>motions, rays, sounds and textures, and</li><li>microstructures of bodies [Bacon’s many uses of the word <em>schematismus</em> show that for him a body’s <em>schematismus</em> is its fine-grained structure. This version will always use ‘microstructure’, but be aware that Bacon doesn’t use a word with the prefix ‘micro’.], and</li><li>feelings and intellectual processes.</li></ul><p>So it’s not at all strange that the sciences don’t grow, given that they have been cut off from their roots.</p><p><strong>81.</strong> <strong>(4)</strong> Another great and powerful cause why the sciences haven’t progressed much is this: You can’t run a race properly when the finishing-post hasn’t been properly positioned and fixed in place. Now the true and lawful finishing-post of the sciences is just <em>new discoveries and powers in the service of human life</em>. But the great majority of the mob ·of supposed scientists· have no feeling for this, and are merely hired lecturers. Well, occasionally some ambitious practitioner who is abler than most spends his own resources on some new invention; but most men are so far from aiming to <em>add</em> anything to the arts and sciences that they don’t even <em>attend to</em> what’s already there or <em>take</em> from it anything that they can’t use in their lectures or use in the pursuit of money or fame or the like. And when one of that multitude <em>does</em> pay court to science with honest affection and for her own sake, even then it turns out that what attracts him is not the stern and unbending search for truth so much as the richness of the array of thoughts and doctrines. And if there should happen to be one who pursues the truth in earnest, even he will be going after •truths that will satisfy his intellect by explaining the causes of things long since discovered, and not •truths that hold promise of new practical applications or •the new light of axioms. If the •end of the sciences hasn’t yet been placed properly, it isn’t strange that men have gone wrong concerning the •means.</p><p><strong>82.</strong> <strong>(5)</strong> So men have mislocated the end and finishing-post of the sciences; but even if they hadn’t, their <em>route</em> to it is completely wrong and impassable. When you think about it carefully, it is amazing that •no mortal has <em>cared</em> enough or <em>thought hard</em> enough to lay out a securely walled road leading to the human intellect directly from the senses and experiment, and that •everything has been left either to the mists of tradition, or the whirl and eddy of argument, or the waves and mazes of random and fragmentary experience. Think about this soberly and carefully: What route <em>have</em> men customarily travelled in investigating and discovering things? No doubt what you will first come up with is a very simple and naive discovery procedure, the most usual one, namely this:</p><blockquote>A man is bracing himself to make a discovery about something: first he seeks out and surveys <strong>everything that has been said about it by others</strong>; then he starts to think for himself; shaking up his mind and, as it were, praying to it to give him oracular pronouncements</blockquote><p>—a ‘method’ that has no foundation at all, rests only on opinions, and goes where they go. Another man may perhaps call on <strong>dialectics</strong> to make his discovery for him, but the discoveries that dialectics is good for are irrelevant to what we are discussing—there’s nothing in common except the word ‘discovery’.</p><p>[Regarding the passage between *asterisks*: Bacon writes of ‘arts’ but doesn’t give examples (medicine and ship-building). This text also expands his in other ways that ·dots· can’t easily indicate.]</p><p>*Arts such as medicine and ship-building are made up of principles and axioms, and dialectics doesn’t discover these; all it can ‘discover’, given that you have the principles and axioms from some other source, is what else is consistent with them. If we try to insist on more than that, demanding that dialectics tell us what the •principles and axioms are, we all know that it will fling the demand back in our faces: ‘For •<em>them</em> you must trust the art in question. For the foundations of medicine, for example, don’t ask <em>dialectics</em>, ask <em>medicine</em>!’* ·Setting aside the opinions of others, and dialectics·, there remains <strong>simple experience</strong>—which we call ‘experiment’ if we were trying to produce it, and ‘chance’ if we weren’t. But such experience is no better than a broom with loose bristles, as the saying is—·those who steer by it are· like men in the dark, patting the walls as they go along hoping to find their way, when they’d have done much better to wait for daylight, or light a candle, and <em>then</em> set off. But <strong>experience managed in the right</strong> •<strong>order</strong> first lights the candle and then uses it to show the way. It starts with experience that is ordered and classified, not jumbled or erratic; from that it derives axioms, and from established axioms it moves on to new experiments; just as God proceeded in an •orderly way when he worked on matter. So don’t be surprised that science hasn’t yet reached the end of its journey, seeing that men have gone altogether astray, either abandoning experience entirely, or getting lost in it and wandering around as in a maze. Whereas a rightly ordered method leads by an unbroken route through the thickets of experience to the open ground of axioms.</p><p><strong>83.</strong> This trouble ·concerning not-finding-the-way· has been greatly increased by an old and <em>harmful</em> opinion or fancy, namely the self-important view that it is beneath the dignity of the human mind to be closely involved with experiments on particular material things given through the senses— especially as they are</p><ul><li>hard work to investigate,</li><li>trivial to think about,</li><li>nasty to report on,</li><li>not suitable things for a gentleman to perform,</li><li>infinite in number, and</li><li>full of extremely small-scale details.</li></ul><p>So that it has finally come to this: the true way is not merely departed from but blocked off. It’s not that experience has been abandoned or badly handled; rather, it has been fastidiously kept at arm’s length.</p><p><strong>84.</strong> <strong>(6)</strong> Men have been kept back from making progress in the sciences, as though by a magic spell, by •their reverence for antiquity, by •the authority of men of high standing in philosophy, and then by •the general acceptance ·of certain propositions·. I have spoken of the last of these ·in <strong>77</strong>· above.</p><p>As for ‘antiquity’, the opinion that men have about it is a lazy one that does violence to the meaning of the word. For really what is <em>antique</em> is •the world in its old age, that is the world <em>now</em>; and •the earlier age of the world when the ancients lived, though in relation to us it was the elder, in relation to the world it was the younger. We expect •an old man to know more about the human condition than •a young man does, and to make more mature judgments about it, because of his experience and the number and variety of things he has seen, heard and thought about. In the same way, more could be fairly expected from •our age (if only we knew and chose to employ its strength) than from •ancient times, because ours is a more advanced age of the world, and has accumulated countless experiments and observations.</p><p>It is also relevant that through long voyages many things in nature will be discovered that may let in new light on philosophy (and such voyages will be increasingly frequent in our age). And given that the regions of the •material domain—i.e. of the earth, the sea and the stars—have been opened up and brought to light, it would surely be disgraceful if the •intellectual domain remained shut up within the narrow limits of old discoveries.</p><p>And with regard to authority: there is something feeble about granting so much to •authors while denying •time its rights—time, which is the author of authors, or rather of all authority. For the saying is ‘Truth is the daughter of time’, not ‘. . . the daughter of authority’!</p><p>We shouldn’t be surprised, then, when we find that the enchantments of •antiquity and •authority and •general agreement have tied up men’s powers—as though putting them under a spell—making them unable to rub shoulders with •<em>things themselves</em>.</p><p><strong>85.</strong> <strong>(7)</strong> What brings man’s work to a halt in face of the discoveries that have already been made is not merely his admiration for antiquity, authority and general agreement, but also his admiration for the long-time achievements of the human race. When you look at the variety and beauty of the devices that the mechanical arts have assembled for men’s use, you’ll surely be more inclined to admire man’s wealth than to have any sense of his poverty! You won’t take into account the fact that</p><blockquote>the original human observations and natural processes (which are the soul and first mover of all that variety)</blockquote><p>are not many and didn’t have to be dug deeply for; and that apart from them it has been merely a matter of</p><blockquote>patience, and the orderly and precise movements of hands and tools.</blockquote><p>For example, it certainly takes precise and accurate work to make a clock, whose wheels seem to imitate the heavenly bodies and, in their alternating and orderly motion, to imitate the pulse of animals; but ·there isn’t much scientific content in this, because the entire mechanism· depends on only a couple of axioms of nature.</p><p>[Bacon next writes about ‘the refinement of the liberal arts’ and of the ‘art’ that goes into ‘the mechanical preparation of natural substances’, and lists the achievements in astronomy, music, language, the alphabet (‘still not used in China’), the making of beer, wine and bread, and so on. His point is that these achievements took centuries of tinkering, and that they involve very little in the way of genuinely scientific knowledge. So they—like the clock—make it less appropriate to wonder at how <em>much</em> we know than to wonder at how <em>little</em>. Then:]</p><p>If you turn from the workshop to the library, and wonder at the immense variety of books you see there, just look carefully into their contents and your amazement will be <em>flipped</em>: having seen their endless repetitions, and seen how men are always saying and doing what has been said and done before, you’ll pass from •admiration at the variety to •astonishment at the poverty and scantiness of the subjects that have so far possessed the minds of men.</p><p>[Next Bacon comments derisively on the intellectual poverty of alchemy. Then:] The students of natural magic, who explain everything by ‘sympathies’ and ‘antipathies’, have in their lazy conjectures credited substances with having wonderful powers and operations. If they have ever they produced any results, they have been more productive of astonishment than of anything useful. [Followed by a slap at ‘superstitious magic’; Bacon expresses some embarrassment at even mentioning this, as he does with alchemy. Finally:] It isn’t surprising that the belief that one has a great deal has been a cause of our having very little.</p><p><strong>86.</strong> <strong>(8)</strong> Furthermore, men’s feeble and almost childish admiration for doctrines and arts has been increased by the tricks and devices of those who have practised and taught the sciences. For they produce them with so much fuss and flourish, putting them before the world all dressed up and masked ·and seemingly ready to go·, as though they were wholly complete and finished. Just look at the structure and the classifications they bring with them! They seem to cover everything that could come up in that subject, and to the minds of the vulgar they present the form and plan of a perfected science; but really the classificatory units are little more than empty bookshelves. The earliest seekers after truth did better than this. Their thoughts about things resulted in knowledge that they want to set down for later use, and they did this in <em>aphorisms</em>—i.e. short unconnected sentences, not linked by any method—and didn’t pretend or profess to cover the entire art. But given the way things are these days, it’s not surprising that men don’t try to make further progress in matters that have been passed down to them as long since perfect and complete.</p><p><strong>87.</strong> <strong>(9)</strong> The •ancient systems have also gained considerably in their reputation and credit from the empty-headed foolishness of those who have propounded •new ones, especially in the area of applied science. There has been no shortage of talkers and dreamers who—partly believing what they say and partly not—have loaded mankind with promises, offering the means to</p><ul><li>prolong life,</li><li>slow down the aging process,</li><li>lessen pain,</li><li>repair natural defects,. . . .</li><li>control and arouse affections,</li><li>sharpen and heighten the intellectual faculties,</li><li>turn substances into other substances (·e.g. lead into gold·),</li><li>make things move, or move faster, at will,</li><li>make changes in the air,</li><li>arrange for influence from the stars,</li><li>prophesy the future,</li><li>make things visible from a long way off,</li><li>reveal things that are hidden,</li></ul><p>and many more. With regard to these ‘benefactors’ it wouldn’t be unfair to say that •their absurdities differ as much from •true arts (in the eyes of the philosopher) as •the exploits of Julius Caesar or Alexander the Great differ from •those of ·such fictional characters as· Amadis of Gaul or the Knights of the Round Table. . . . It isn’t surprising that prejudice is raised against new propositions, especially ones that are said to have practical implications, because of those impostors who have tried something similar. . . .</p><p>[[Bacon seems to speaking of  <a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/04/15/the-cowpox-of-doubt/"">idea inoculation</a> here where people have been inoculated against new sciences because of the charlatans promising things they fail to deliver.]]</p><p><strong>88.</strong> <strong>(10)</strong> Far more harm has been done to knowledge by pettiness, and the smallness and triviality of the tasks that men have tackled. It is made worse by the fact that this pettiness comes with a certain air of arrogance and superiority. A now-familiar general device that is found in all the arts is this: the author blames <em>nature</em> for any weakness in his art, declaring—on the authority of his art!—that whatever his art can’t achieve is intrinsically impossible. [‘Art’ refers to any human activity that involves techniques and requires skills.] If arts are to be their own judges, then clearly none will be found guilty! Moreover, the philosophy that is now in play hugs to itself certain tenets whose purpose. . . .is to persuade men that we can’t expect art or human labour to come up with any results that are hard to get, requiring that nature be commanded and subdued. The doctrine that the sun’s heat and fire’s heat differ in kind is an example of this, and another is the doctrine about mixture—both mentioned earlier, ·in <strong>75</strong>·. If you think about it carefully you’ll see that all this involves a wrong limiting of human power; it tends—and is <em>meant to</em> tend—to produce an unnatural despair; and this not only messes up the auguries that might give hope but also cuts the sinews and spurs of industry, and loads the dice against experience itself. And all for the sake of having us think that their art has been completed, and for the miserable ‘triumph’ of getting us to believe that whatever <em>hasn’t yet</em> been discovered and understood <em>can’t ever</em> be discovered or understood.</p><p>And when someone <em>does</em> get in touch with reality and try to discover something new, he will confine himself to investigating and working out some <em>one</em> topic, such as</p><ul><li>the nature of the magnet,</li><li>the tides,</li><li>mapping the heavens,</li></ul><p>and things like that, which seem to be somewhat isolated from everything else and have hitherto been tackled without much success; whereas really it is an ignorant mistake to study something in isolation. Why? Because a nature that seems to be •latent and hidden in some things is •obvious and (as it were) palpable in others, so that people puzzle over it in •the former while nobody even notices it in •the latter. Consider the <em>holding-together</em> ·of material things·. Wood and stones hold together, but people pay no attention to that fact, merely saying of wood and stone that ‘they are <em>solid</em>’ and giving no further thought to why they don’t fall apart, breaking up their continuity; while with water-bubbles—in which a sort of hemispherical skin is formed, fending off for a moment the breaking up of the continuity—the holding together seems to be a subtle matter.</p><p>In fact, what in some things is regarded as special to them ·and not present in the rest of nature· also occurs elsewhere in an obvious and well-known form, but it won’t be recognized <em>there</em> as long as the experiments and thoughts of men are engaged only on the former, ·i.e. on the less obvious and supposedly ‘special’ cases·. But generally speaking, in mechanics all that is needed for someone to pass off an old result as something new is •to refine or embellish it, •to combine it with some others, •to make it handier for practical application, •to produce the result on a larger or a smaller scale than had been done before, or the like.</p><p>So it is no wonder that no important discoveries worthy of mankind have been brought to light, when men have been satisfied—indeed <em>pleased</em>—with such trifling and puerile tasks, and have even fancied that in them they were trying for something great, if not achieving it.</p><p><strong>89.</strong> <strong>(11)</strong> Bear in mind also that in every period natural philosophy has had a troublesome and recalcitrant adversary in superstition and blind religious extremism. Among the Greeks those who first proposed <em>natural</em> causes for lightning and for storms were condemned for disrespect towards the gods. And some of the fathers of the early Christian church were not much milder in their attitude to those who, on most convincing grounds that no sane person would question today, maintained that the earth is round and thus that the antipodes exist.</p><p>Even today it is harder and more dangerous ·than it ought to be· to talk about nature, because of the procedures of the theological schoolmen. They regularized theology as much as they could, and worked it into the shape of an art [here = ‘academic discipline’], and then incorporated into the body of religion more of Aristotle’s contentious and thorny philosophy than would properly fit there. The same result is apt to arise, though in a different way, from the theories of those who have been so bold as to infer the truth of the Christian religion from the principles of •philosophers, and to confirm it by •their authority. They have solemnly and ceremonially celebrated this union of the senses with faith as a lawful marriage, entertaining [<em>permulcentes</em>] men’s minds with a pleasing variety things to think about but also mixing [<em>permiscentes</em>] the human with the divine in an unseemly fashion. In such mixtures of theology with philosophy only the accepted doctrines of philosophy are included, while •new ones—which may be changes for the better—are driven off and wiped out.</p><p>Lastly, you will find that some ignorant divines close off access to any philosophy, however ‘purified’ it may be. •Some are feebly afraid that a deeper search into nature would take one beyond the limits of what is proper; and they take what is said in the Scriptures against those who pry into</p><ul><li><em>sacred </em>mysteries,</li></ul><p>wrenching it away from there and transferring it to</p><ul><li>the hidden things of n<em>ature,</em></li></ul><p>which are not fenced off by any prohibition ·in the Bible·. •Other divines are more complex and thoughtful: they think that if middle causes [see note in <strong>65</strong>] aren’t known then it will be easier to explain <em>everything</em> in terms of God’s hand and rod; and they think that this is greatly in the interests of religion, whereas really it’s nothing but <em>trying to gratify God by a lie</em>. •Others are led by past examples to fear that movements and changes in philosophy will end in attacks on religion. And •others again—·bringing us to the end of my list·—seem to be afraid that if nature is investigated something may be found to subvert religion or at least to shake its authority, especially with the unlearned. But these two last fears strike me as having come from thinking at the level of the lower animals, ·like a dog cowering in fear when it hears an unfamiliar noise·; it’s as though these men in their heart of hearts weren’t sure of the strength of religion and of faith’s domination of the senses, and were therefore scared that the investigation of truth in nature might be dangerous to them. But in point of fact natural philosophy is second only to the Bible as the best antidote to superstition and the most approved nourishment for faith. So natural philosophy deserves its place as religion’s most faithful handmaid: religion displays God’s •will, while natural philosophy displays his •power. . . . ·Summing up·: it isn’t surprising that •natural philosophy is stunted in its growth when religion, the thing that has most power over men’s minds, has been pulled into the fight <em>against</em> •it by the stupidity and incautious zeal of certain people.</p><p><strong>90.</strong> <strong>(12)</strong> Moving on now: in the customs and institutions of schools, academies, colleges, and similar bodies whose role is to house learned men and to develop learning, <em>everything</em> turns out to work against the progress of the sciences. Their lectures and tests are devised in such a way that it would be hard for anyone to think or speculate about anything out of the common rut. And if one or two have the courage to <em>judge freely</em>, they’ll have to do it all by themselves with no help from the company of others. And if they can put up with that too, they will find that their hard work and breadth of mind are a considerable hindrance to their careers! For the studies of men in these places are confined—as it were <em>imprisoned</em>—in the writings of certain authors, and if anyone disagrees with them he is immediately accused of being a trouble-maker and a revolutionary. But ·this is all wrong, because· the situation of the •arts is quite different from that of the •state, and the coming of •new light ·in the arts· is not like the coming of •new events ·in the state·. In matters of state any change—even a change for the better—is under suspicion of making trouble, because politics rests on authority, consent, fame and opinion, not on demonstration. But arts and sciences should be like quarries, where the noise of new works and further advances is heard on every side. That is how things stand according to right reason, but it’s not what actually happens; and the things I have reported in the administration and government of learning severely restrain the advancement of the sciences.</p><p><strong>91.</strong> Indeed, even if that hostility ·towards new work· stopped, the growth of the sciences would still be held back by the fact that high aims and hard work in this field go unrewarded. For the <em>rewarding</em> of scientific achievement and the <em>performing</em> of it are not in the same hands. The growth of the sciences comes from high intelligence, while the prizes and rewards of them are in the hands of the common people, or of ‘great’ persons who are nearly all quite ignorant. Moreover, not only do scientific advances bring no rewards or other benefits, they don’t even get popular applause. For the common run of people aren’t up to the task of understanding such matters, so that news about them is apt to be blown away by the gales of popular opinions. And it’s not surprising that endeavours that are not honoured don’t prosper.</p><p><strong>92.</strong> <strong>(13)</strong> By far the greatest obstacle to the progress of science—to the launching of new projects and the opening up of new fields of inquiry—is that men despair and think things impossible. For in these matters it’s the careful, serious people who have no confidence at all, and are taken up with such thoughts as that</p><ul><li>nature is dark,</li><li>life is short,</li><li>the senses are deceptive,</li><li>judgment is weak,</li><li>experiments are hard to do,</li></ul><p>and the like. They think that •throughout the centuries the sciences have their ebbs and flows, sometimes growing and flourishing and at others withering and decaying, but that •a time will come when the sciences are in a state from which no further progress will be possible. ·And they evidently think that that time lies in the <em>very</em> near future·. So if anyone expects or undertakes to make further discoveries, they set this down to his immature irresponsibility. Such endeavours, they think, start well, become harder as they go on, and end in confusion. This is a way of thinking that sober intelligent men are likely to fall into, and we mustn’t let <em>their</em> charms and attractions lead us to relax or mitigate our judgment ·of their line of thought·. We should carefully note what gleams of hope there are and what direction they come from; and—·changing the metaphor·—we should disregard the lighter breezes of hope but seriously and attentively follow the winds that seem to be steadier. We must also look to political prudence for advice, and to <em>take</em> the advice it gives; it is distrustful on principle, and takes a dim view of human affairs. So my topic here ·and to the end of <strong>114</strong>· is <em>hope</em>; for I don’t trade in promises, and don’t want to affect men’s judgments by force or by trickery; rather, I want to lead them by the hand without coercion. The best way to inspire hope will be to bring men to <em>particulars</em>, especially ones that are set out in an orderly way in the Tables of Discovery (partly in this work ·<strong>112–113</strong> and <strong>218</strong>·, but much more in the fourth part of my Great Fresh Start [see note in <strong>31</strong>], because this isn’t merely a •hope for the thing but •the thing itself. But I want to come at things gently, so ·instead of jumping straight to the Tables· I shall proceed with my plan of <em>preparing</em> men’s minds, for <strong>hope</strong> is a significant part even of preparation. If all the other inducements aren’t accompanied by <strong>hope</strong>, their effect on men is not to •ginger them up and get them busy but rather to •make them depressed by giving them an even darker view of how things now stand and making them even more fully aware of the unhappiness of their own condition. So there is a point in my revealing and recommending the views of mine that make <strong>hope</strong> in this matter reasonable. It’s like what Columbus did <em>before</em> his wonderful voyage across the Atlantic, giving reasons for his belief that hitherto unknown lands and continents might be discovered. His reasons were rejected at first, but later they were vindicated by experience, and were the causes and beginnings of great events.</p><p><em>The next post in the sequence, Book 1: 93-130 (The Baconian Method), will be posted Thursday, October 10th at latest by 6:00pm PDT.</em></p>",Francis Bacon,francis-bacon,Francis Bacon,

Specifically, I can usually catch such mistakes by double-checking my work, but the cost of not being able to trust my initial results and redo steps is very high. High enough that I&apos;m willing to spend time working to reduce the number of such mistakes I make even if it means slowing down quite a bit or adopting some other costly process.</p><p>If you&apos;ve either developed such strategies for avoiding making such mistakes or would good at it in the first place, what do you do?</p><p>Two notes on the type of answers I&apos;m looking for:</p><p>1. I should note that one answer is just to use something like WolframAlpha or Mathematica, which I do. That said, I&apos;m still interested in not having to rely on such tools for things in the general symbol manipulation reference class as I don&apos;t like relying on my computer being present to do these sorts of things.</p><p>2. I did do some looking around for work addressing this (found <a href=""https://artofproblemsolving.com/news/articles/stop-making-stupid-mistakes"">this</a> for example), but most of it suggested basic strategies that I already implement like being neat and checking your work.</p>",,,,

Not so simple as a verbal definition, but something like a utility function. Something separate from planning or reasoning, that was purely about preferences, which you could plug into an AI which would then do some totally separate work to turn preferences into choices.</p><p>Turns out that runs into some serious obstacles.</p><p><strong>I</strong></p><p>  The difficulty of value learning is that there is no One True Utility Function to be assigned the globs of atoms we call humans. To think about them as having desires at all requires viewing them at a suitable level of abstraction - though of course, there's no One True Level Of Abstraction, either. (I promise this is my last post that's basically just consequences of needing the <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NvqGmLBCtvQxfMs9m/the-artificial-intentional-stance"">intentional stance</a> for a while.)</p><p>  Call the world-model the AI uses to best predict the world its ""native ontology."" If I want to go to the gym, we want the AI to look at the atoms and see ""Charlie wants to go to the gym."" The thing that I want is not some specific state of the AI's native ontology. Instead, I can only ""want"" something in an <em>abstracted</em> ontology that not only contains the AI's intentional-stance model of ""Charlie,"" but also intentional-stance-compatible abstractions for ""go"" and ""gym."" In short, abstraction is contagious.</p><p>  This is like the idea of an <em>umwelt </em>(oom-velt), introduced by early philosopher of biology Jakob Johann von Uexküll. In nature, different organisms can have different effective models of the world even though they live in the same environment. They only evolve to model what is necessary for them to survive and reproduce. The umwelt is a term for this modeled world. The umwelt of a bloodsucking tick consists largely of things to climb on and warm-blooded mammals, which are perceived not by sight but by a certain smell and body temperature.</p><p>  I think of the AI's intentional stance as not just being a specially abstract model of me, but also being a model of my entire umwelt. It needs an abstraction of the gym because the gym is a part of my inner world, an abstract concept that gets referenced in my plans and desires.</p><p><strong>II</strong></p><p>  Back to value learning. The bare minimum for success is that we build an AI that can predict which actions will do a good job satisfying human values. But how minimalist do we really have to be? Can we get it to output an abstract object corresponding to human values, like a utility function or some compression thereof?</p><p>  Well, maybe. If it had a complete understanding of humans, maybe it could take that abstract, intentional stance description of humans and cash it out into a utility function over world-histories. Note that this is over world-histories, not world-states, because humans' abstractions often involve things like duration and change. So one problem is that this object is impractically massive, both to construct and to use. In order to actually do anything with human values, what we want is the compressed, abstracted version, and this turns out to more or less consist of the entire AI.</p><p>  It's theoretically convenient to think about separating values and planning, only passing a utility function from one to the other, but in practice the utility function is too big to construct, which means that the planning step must repeatedly talk to the abstract model, and is no longer so cleanly separate from it, especially if we imagine optimizing end-to-end, causing every part to be optimized to fit every other part, like two trees growing intertwined.</p><p>  The other factor blurring any neat lines is meta-ethics. We might want to use meta-ethical data - information learned by observing and talking to humans - to change how the AI treats its information about human values, or even change which decision theory it's using. You can frame this as preferences over the AI's own code, but this is still a case of supposedly simpler preferences actually containing the specification of the whole AI.</p><p>  These violations of clean separability tell us that our goal shouldn't be to find a separate ""human values"" object. Except in special cases that we really shouldn't count on, the entire FAI is the ""human values"" object, and all of its parts might make sense only in the context of its other parts. The AI doesn't have a model of what it should do, the AI <em>is</em> the model.</p>",Charlie Steiner,charlie-steiner,Charlie Steiner,

[...] But intelligence per se does not generate the drive for domination, any more than horns do.&quot;</p><p><a href=""https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/dont-fear-the-terminator/"">https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/dont-fear-the-terminator/</a></p><h2>Comment Thread #1</h2><p><strong>Elliot Olds:</strong> Yann, the smart people who are very worried about AI seeking power and ensuring its own survival believe it&apos;s a big risk because power and survival are instrumental goals for almost any ultimate goal.</p><p>If you give a generally intelligent AI the goal to make as much money in the stock market as possible, it will resist being shut down because that would interfere with tis goal. It would try to become more powerful because then it could make money more effectively. This is the natural consequence of giving a smart agent a goal, unless we do something special to counteract this.</p><p>You&apos;ve often written about how we shouldn&apos;t be so worried about AI, but I&apos;ve never seen you address this point directly.</p><p><strong>Stuart Russell:</strong> It is trivial to construct a toy MDP in which the agent&apos;s only reward comes from fetching the coffee. If, in that MDP, there is another &quot;human&quot; who has some probability, however small, of switching the agent off, and if the agent has available a button that switches off that human, the agent will necessarily press that button as part of the optimal solution for fetching the coffee. No hatred, no desire for power, no built-in emotions, no built-in survival instinct, nothing except the desire to fetch the coffee successfully. This point cannot be addressed because it&apos;s a simple mathematical observation.</p><h2>Comment Thread #2</h2><p><strong>Yoshua Bengio:</strong> Yann, I&apos;d be curious about your response to Stuart Russell&apos;s point.</p><p><strong>Yann LeCun</strong>: You mean, the so-called &quot;instrumental convergence&quot; argument by which &quot;a robot can&apos;t fetch you coffee if it&apos;s dead. Hence it will develop self-preservation as an instrumental sub-goal.&quot;</p><p>It might even kill you if you get in the way.</p><p>1. Once the robot has brought you coffee, its self-preservation instinct disappears. You can turn it off.</p><p>2. One would have to be unbelievably stupid to build open-ended objectives in a super-intelligent (and super-powerful) machine without some safeguard terms in the objective.</p><p>3. One would have to be rather incompetent not to have a mechanism by which new terms in the objective could be added to prevent previously-unforeseen bad behavior. For humans, we have education and laws to shape our objective functions and complement the hardwired terms built into us by evolution.</p><p>4. The power of even the most super-intelligent machine is limited by physics, and its size and needs make it vulnerable to physical attacks. No need for much intelligence here. A virus is infinitely less intelligent than you, but it can still kill you.</p><p>5. A second machine, designed solely to neutralize an evil super-intelligent machine will win every time, if given similar amounts of computing resources (because specialized machines always beat general ones).</p><p>Bottom line: there are lots and lots of ways to protect against badly-designed intelligent machines turned evil.</p><p>Stuart has called me stupid in the Vanity Fair interview linked below for allegedly not understanding the whole idea of instrumental convergence.</p><p>It&apos;s not that I don&apos;t understand it. I think it would only be relevant in a fantasy world in which people would be smart enough to design super-intelligent machines, yet ridiculously stupid to the point of giving it moronic objectives with no safeguards.</p><p>Here is the juicy bit from the article where Stuart calls me stupid:</p><blockquote>Russell took exception to the views of Yann LeCun, who developed the forerunner of the convolutional neural nets used by AlphaGo and is Facebook&#x2019;s director of A.I. research. LeCun told the BBC that there would be no Ex Machina or Terminator scenarios, because robots would not be built with human drives&#x2014;hunger, power, reproduction, self-preservation. &#x201C;Yann LeCun keeps saying that there&#x2019;s no reason why machines would have any self-preservation instinct,&#x201D; Russell said. &#x201C;And it&#x2019;s simply and mathematically false. I mean, it&#x2019;s so obvious that a machine will have self-preservation even if you don&#x2019;t program it in because if you say, &#x2018;Fetch the coffee,&#x2019; it can&#x2019;t fetch the coffee if it&#x2019;s dead. So if you give it any goal whatsoever, it has a reason to preserve its own existence to achieve that goal. And if you threaten it on your way to getting coffee, it&#x2019;s going to kill you because any risk to the coffee has to be countered. People have explained this to LeCun in very simple terms.&#x201D;</blockquote><p><a href=""https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/03/elon-musk-billion-dollar-crusade-to-stop-ai-space-x"">https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/03/elon-musk-billion-dollar-crusade-to-stop-ai-space-x</a></p><p><strong>Tony Zador</strong>: I agree with most of what Yann wrote about Stuart Russell&apos;s concern.</p><p>Specifically, I think the flaw in Stuart&apos;s argument is the assertion that &quot;switching off the human is the optimal solution&quot;---who says that&apos;s an optimal solution?</p><p>I guess if you posit an omnipotent robot, destroying humanity might be a possible solution. But if the robot is not omnipotent, then killing humans comes at considerable risk, ie that they will retaliate. Or humans might build special &quot;protector robots&quot; whose value function is solely focused on preventing the killing of humans by other robots. Presumably these robots would be at least as well armed as the coffee robots. So this really increases the risk to the coffee robots of pursuing the genocide strategy.</p><p>And if the robot is omnipotent, then there are an infinite number of alternative strategies to ensure survival (like putting up an impenetrable forcefield around the off switch) that work just as well.</p><p>So i would say that killing all humans is not only not likely to be an optimal strategy under most scenarios, the set of scenarios under which it is optimal is probably close to a set of measure 0.</p><p><strong>Stuart Russell</strong>: Thanks for clearing that up - so 2+2 is not equal to 4, because if the 2 were a 3, the answer wouldn&apos;t be 4? I simply pointed out that in the MDP as I defined it, switching off the human is the optimal solution, despite the fact that we didn&apos;t put in any emotions of power, domination, hate, testosterone, etc etc. And your solution seems, well, frankly terrifying, although I suppose the NRA would approve. Your last suggestion, that the robot could prevent anyone from ever switching it off, is also one of the things we are trying to avoid. The point is that the behaviors we are concerned about have nothing to do with putting in emotions of survival, power, domination, etc. So arguing that there&apos;s no need to put those emotions in is completely missing the point.</p><p><strong>Yann LeCun</strong>: Not clear whether you are referring to my comment or Tony&apos;s.</p><p>The point is that behaviors you are concerned about are easily avoidable by simple terms in the objective. In the unlikely event that these safeguards somehow fail, my partial list of escalating solutions (which you seem to find terrifying) is there to prevent a catastrophe. So arguing that emotions of survival etc will inevitably lead to dangerous behavior is completely missing the point.</p><p>It&apos;s a bit like saying that building cars without brakes will lead to fatalities.</p><p>Yes, but why would we be so stupid as to not include brakes?</p><p>That said, instrumental subgoals are much weaker drives of behavior than hardwired objectives. Else, how could one explain the lack of domination behavior in non-social animals, such as orangutans.</p><p><strong>Francesca Rossi:</strong> @Yann Indeed it would be odd to design an AI system with a specific goal, like fetching coffee, and capabilities that include killing humans or disallowing being turned off, without equipping it also with guidelines and priorities to constrain its freedom, so it can understand for example that fetching coffee is not so important that it is worth killing a human being to do it. Value alignment is fundamental to achieve this. Why would we build machines that are not aligned to our values? Stuart, I agree that it would easy to build a coffee fetching machine that is not aligned to our values, but why would we do this? Of course value alignment is not easy, and still a research challenge, but I would make it part of the picture when we envision future intelligent machines.</p><p><strong>Richard Mallah:</strong> Francesca, of course Stuart believes we should create value-aligned AI. The point is that there are too many caveats to explicitly add each to an objective function, and there are strong socioeconomic drives for humans to monetize AI prior to getting it sufficiently right, sufficiently safe.</p><p><strong>Stuart Russell:</strong> &quot;Why would be build machines that are not aligned to our values?&quot; That&apos;s what we are doing, all the time. The standard model of AI assumes that the objective is fixed and known (check the textbook!), and we build machines on that basis - whether it&apos;s clickthrough maximization in social media content selection or total error minimization in photo labeling (Google Jacky Alcin&#xE9;) or, per Danny Hillis, profit maximization in fossil fuel companies. This is going to become even more untenable as machines become more powerful. There is no hope of &quot;solving the value alignment problem&quot; in the sense of figuring out the right value function offline and putting it into the machine. We need to change the way we do AI.</p><p><strong>Yoshua Bengio:</strong> All right, we&apos;re making some progress towards a healthy debate. Let me try to summarize my understanding of the arguments. Yann LeCun and Tony Zadorr argue that humans would be stupid to put in explicit dominance instincts in our AIs. Stuart Russell responds that it needs not be explicit but dangerous or immoral behavior may simply arise out of imperfect value alignment and instrumental subgoals set by the machine to achieve its official goals. Yann LeCun and Tony Zador respond that we would be stupid not to program the proper &apos;laws of robotics&apos; to protect humans. Stuart Russell is concerned that value alignment is not a solved problem and may be intractable (i.e. there will always remain a gap, and a sufficiently powerful AI could &apos;exploit&apos; this gap, just like very powerful corporations currently often act legally but immorally). Yann LeCun and Tony Zador argue that we could also build defensive military robots designed to only kill regular AIs gone rogue by lack of value alignment. Stuart Russell did not explicitly respond to this but I infer from his NRA reference that we could be worse off with these defensive robots because now they have explicit weapons and can also suffer from the value misalignment problem.</p><p><strong>Yoshua Bengio:</strong> So at the end of the day, it boils down to whether we can handle the value misalignment problem, and I&apos;m afraid that it&apos;s not clear we can for sure, but it also seems reasonable to think we will be able to in the future. Maybe part of the problem is that Yann LeCun and Tony Zador are satisfied with a 99.9% probability that we can fix the value alignment problem while Stuart Russell is not satisfied with taking such an existential risk.</p><p><strong>Yoshua Bengio:</strong> And there is another issue which was not much discussed (although the article does talk about the short-term risks of military uses of AI etc), and which concerns me: humans can easily do stupid things. So even if there are ways to mitigate the possibility of rogue AIs due to value misalignment, how can we guarantee that no single human will act stupidly (more likely, greedily for their own power) and unleash dangerous AIs in the world? And for this, we don&apos;t even need superintelligent AIs, to feel very concerned. The value alignment problem also applies to humans (or companies) who have a lot of power: the misalignment between their interests and the common good can lead to catastrophic outcomes, as we already know (e.g. tragedy of the commons, corruption, companies lying to have you buy their cigarettes or their oil, etc). It just gets worse when more power can be concentrated in the hands of a single person or organization, and AI advances can provide that power.</p><p><strong>Francesca Rossi:</strong> I am more optimistic than Stuart about the value alignment problem. I think that a suitable combination of symbolic reasoning and various forms of machine learning can help us to both advance AI&#x2019;s capabilities and get closer to solving the value alignment problem.</p><p><strong>Tony Zador:</strong> @Stuart Russell &quot;Thanks for clearing that up - so 2+2 is not equal to 4, because if the 2 were a 3, the answer wouldn&apos;t be 4? &quot;</p><p>hmm. not quite what i&apos;m saying.</p><p>If we&apos;re going for the math analogies, then i would say that a better analogy is:</p><p>Find X, Y such that X+Y=4.</p><p>The &quot;killer coffee robot&quot; solution is {X=642, Y = -638}. In other words: Yes, it is a solution, but not a particularly natural or likely or good solution.</p><p>But we humans are blinded but our own warped perspective. We focus on the solution that involves killing other creatures because that appears to be one of the main solutions that we humans default to. But it is not a particularly common solution in the natural world, nor do i think it&apos;s a particularly effective solution in the long run.</p><p><strong>Yann LeCun:</strong> Humanity has been very familiar with the problem of fixing value misalignments for millenia.</p><p>We fix our children&apos;s hardwired values by teaching them how to behave.</p><p>We fix human value misalignment by laws. Laws create extrinsic terms in our objective functions and cause the appearance of instrumental subgoals (&quot;don&apos;t steal&quot;) in order to avoid punishment. The desire for social acceptance also creates such instrumental subgoals driving good behavior.</p><p>We even fix value misalignment for super-human and super-intelligent entities, such as corporations and governments.</p><p>This last one occasionally fails, which is a considerably more immediate existential threat than AI.</p><p><strong>Tony Zador:</strong> @Yoshua Bengio I agree with much of your summary. I agree value alignment is important, and that it is not a solved problem.</p><p>I also agree that new technologies often have unintended and profound consequences. The invention of books has led to a decline in our memories (people used to recite the entire Odyssey). Improvements in food production technology (and other factors) have led to a surprising obesity epidemic. The invention of social media is disrupting our political systems in ways that, to me anyway, have been quite surprising. So improvements in AI will undoubtedly have profound consequences for society, some of which will be negative.</p><p>But in my view, focusing on &quot;killer robots that dominate or step on humans&quot; is a distraction from much more serious issues.</p><p>That said, perhaps &quot;killer robots&quot; can be thought of as a metaphor (or metonym) for the set of all scary scenarios that result from this powerful new technology.</p><p><strong>Yann LeCun:</strong> @Stuart Russell you write &quot;we need to change the way we do AI&quot;. The problems you describe have nothing to do with AI per se.</p><p>They have to do with designing (not avoiding) explicit instrumental objectives for entities (e.g. corporations) so that their overall behavior works for the common good. This is a problem of law, economics, policies, ethics, and the problem of controlling complex dynamical systems composed of many agents in interaction.</p><p>What is required is a mechanism through which objectives can be changed quickly when issues surface. For example, Facebook stopped maximizing clickthroughs several years ago and stopped using the time spent in the app as a criterion about 2 years ago. It put in place measures to limit the dissemination of clickbait, and it favored content shared by friends rather than directly disseminating content from publishers.</p><p>We certainly agree that designing good objectives is hard. Humanity has struggled with designing objectives for itself for millennia. So this is not a new problem. If anything, designing objectives for machines, and forcing them to abide by them will be a lot easier than for humans, since we can physically modify their firmware.</p><p>There will be mistakes, no doubt, as with any new technology (early jetliners lost wings, early cars didn&apos;t have seat belts, roads didn&apos;t have speed limits...).</p><p>But I disagree that there is a high risk of accidentally building existential threats to humanity.</p><p>Existential threats to humanity have to be explicitly designed as such.</p><p><strong>Yann LeCun:</strong> It will be much, much easier to control the behavior of autonomous AI systems than it has been for humans and human organizations, because we will be able to directly modify their intrinsic objective function.</p><p>This is very much unlike humans, whose objective can only be shaped through extrinsic objective functions (through education and laws), that indirectly create instrumental sub-objectives (&quot;be nice, don&apos;t steal, don&apos;t kill, or you will be punished&quot;).</p><p>As I have pointed out in several talks in the last several years, autonomous AI systems will need to have a trainable part in their objective, which would allow their handlers to train them to behave properly, without having to directly hack their objective function by programmatic means.</p><p><strong>Yoshua Bengio:</strong> Yann, these are good points, we indeed have much more control over machines than humans since we can design (and train) their objective function. I actually have some hopes that by using an objective-based mechanism relying on learning (to inculcate values) rather than a set of hard rules (like in much of our legal system), we could achieve more robustness to unforeseen value alignment mishaps. In fact, I surmise we should do that with human entities too, i.e., penalize companies, e.g. fiscally, when they behave in a way which hurts the common good, even if they are not directly violating an explicit law. This also suggests to me that we should try to avoid that any entity (person, company, AI) have too much power, to avoid such problems. On the other hand, although probably not in the near future, there could be AI systems which surpass human intellectual power in ways that could foil our attempts at setting objective functions which avoid harm to us. It seems hard to me to completely deny that possibility, which thus would beg for more research in (machine-) learning moral values, value alignment, and maybe even in public policies about AI (to minimize the events in which a stupid human brings about AI systems without the proper failsafes) etc.</p><p><strong>Yann LeCun:</strong> @Yoshua Bengio if we can build &quot;AI systems which surpass human intellectual power in ways that could foil our attempts at setting objective functions&quot;, we can also build similarly-powerful AI systems to set those objective functions.</p><p>Sort of like the discriminator in GANs....</p><p><strong>Yann LeCun:</strong> @Yoshua Bengio a couple direct comments on your summary:</p><ul><li>designing objectives for super-human entities is not a new problem. Human societies have been doing this through laws (concerning corporations and governments) for millennia.</li><li>the defensive AI systems designed to protect against rogue AI systems are not akin to the military, they are akin to the police, to law enforcement. Their &quot;jurisdiction&quot; would be strictly AI systems, not humans.</li></ul><p>But until we have a hint of a beginning of a design, with some visible path towards autonomous AI systems with non-trivial intelligence, we are arguing about the sex of angels.</p><p><strong>Yuri Barzov:</strong> Aren&apos;t we overestimating the ability of imperfect humans to build a perfect machine? If it will be much more powerful than humans its imperfections will be also magnified. Cute human kids grow up into criminals if they get spoiled by reinforcement i.e. addiction to rewards. We use reinforcement and backpropagation (kind of reinforcement) in modern golden standard AI systems. Do we know enough about humans to be able to build a fault-proof human friendly super intelligent machine?</p><p><strong>Yoshua Bengio:</strong> @Yann LeCun, about discriminators in GANs, and critics in Actor-Critic RL, one thing we know is that they tend to be biased. That is why the critic in Actor-Critic is not used as an objective function but instead as a baseline to reduce the variance. Similarly, optimizing the generator wrt a fixed discriminator does not work (you would converge to a single mode - unless you balance that with entropy maximization). Anyways, just to say, there is much more research to do, lots of unknown unknowns about learning moral objective functions for AIs. I&apos;m not afraid of research challenges, but I can understand that some people would be concerned about the safety of gradually more powerful AIs with misaligned objectives. I actually like the way that Stuart Russell is attacking this problem by thinking about it not just in terms of an objective function but also about uncertainty: the AI should avoid actions which might hurt us (according to a self-estimate of the uncertain consequences of actions), and stay the conservative course with high confidence of accomplishing the mission while not creating collateral damage. I think that what you and I are trying to say is that all this is quite different from the terminator scenarios which some people in the media are brandishing. I also agree with you that there are lots of unknown unknowns about the strengths and weaknesses of future AIs, but I think that it is not too early to start thinking about these issues.</p><p><strong>Yoshua Bengio:</strong> @Yuri Barzov the answer to your question: no. But we don&apos;t know that it is not feasible either, and we have reasons to believe that (a) it is not for tomorrow such machines will exist and (b) we have intellectual tools which may lead to solutions. Or maybe not!</p><p><strong>Stuart Russell:</strong> Yann&apos;s comment &quot;Facebook stopped maximizing clickthroughs several years ago and stopped using the time spent in the app as a criterion about 2 years ago&quot; makes my point for me. Why did they stop doing it? Because it was the wrong objective function. Yann says we&apos;d have to be &quot;extremely stupid&quot; to put the wrong objective into a super-powerful machine. Facebook&apos;s platform is not super-smart but it is super-powerful, because it connects with billions of people for hours every day. And yet they put the wrong objective function into it. QED. Fortunately they were able to reset it, but unfortunately one has to assume it&apos;s still optimizing a fixed objective. And the fact that it&apos;s operating within a large corporation that&apos;s designed to maximize another fixed objective - profit - means we cannot switch it off.</p><p><strong>Stuart Russell:</strong> Regarding &quot;externalities&quot; - when talking about externalities, economists are making essentially the same point I&apos;m making: externalities are the things not stated in the given objective function that get damaged when the system optimizes that objective function. In the case of the atmosphere, it&apos;s relatively easy to measure the amount of pollution and charge for it via taxes or fines, so correcting the problem is possible (unless the offender is too powerful). In the case of manipulation of human preferences and information states, it&apos;s very hard to assess costs and impose taxes or fines. The theory of uncertain objectives suggests instead that systems be designed to be &quot;minimally invasive&quot;, i.e., don&apos;t mess with parts of the world state whose value is unclear. In particular, as a general rule it&apos;s probably best to avoid using fixed-objective reinforcement learning in human-facing systems, because the reinforcement learner will learn how to manipulate the human to maximize its objective.</p><p><strong>Stuart Russell:</strong> @Yann LeCun Let&apos;s talk about climate change for a change. Many argue that it&apos;s an existential or near-existential threat to humanity. Was it &quot;explicitly designed&quot; as such? We created the corporation, which is a fixed-objective maximizer. The purpose was not to create an existential risk to humanity. Fossil-fuel corporations became super-powerful and, in certain relevant senses, super-intelligent: they anticipated and began planning for global warming five decades ago, executing a campaign that outwitted the rest of the human race. They didn&apos;t win the academic argument but they won in the real world, and the human race lost. I just attended an NAS meeting on climate control systems, where the consensus was that it was too dangerous to develop, say, solar radiation management systems - not because they might produce unexpected disastrous effects but because the fossil fuel corporations would use their existence as a further form of leverage in their so-far successful campaign to keep burning more carbon.</p><p><strong>Stuart Russell:</strong> @Yann LeCun This seems to be a very weak argument. The objection raised by Omohundro and others who discuss instrumental goals is aimed at any system that operates by optimizing a fixed, known objective; which covers pretty much all present-day AI systems. So the issue is: what happens if we keep to that general plan - let&apos;s call it the &quot;standard model&quot; - and improve the capabilities for the system to achieve the objective? We don&apos;t need to know today *how* a future system achieves objectives more successfully, to see that it would be problematic. So the proposal is, don&apos;t build systems according to the standard model.</p><p><strong>Yann LeCun:</strong> @Stuart Russell the problem is that essentially no AI system today is autonomous.</p><p>They are all trained *in advance* to optimize an objective, and subsequently execute the task with no regards to the objective, hence with no way to spontaneously deviate from the original behavior.</p><p>As of today, as far as I can tell, we do *not* have a good design for an autonomous machine, driven by an objective, capable of coming up with new strategies to optimize this objective in the real world.</p><p>We have plenty of those in games and simple simulation. But the learning paradigms are way too inefficient to be practical in the real world.</p><p><strong>Yuri Barzov:</strong> @Yoshua Bengio yes. If we frame the problem correctly we will be able to resolve it. AI puts natural intelligence into focus like a magnifying mirror</p><p><strong>Yann LeCun:</strong> @Stuart Russell in pretty much everything that society does (business, government, of whatever) behaviors are shaped through incentives, penalties via contracts, regulations and laws (let&apos;s call them collectively the objective function), which are proxies for the metric that needs to be optimized.</p><p>Because societies are complex systems, because humans are complex agents, and because conditions evolve, it is a requirement that the objective function be modifiable to correct unforeseen negative effects, loopholes, inefficiencies, etc.</p><p>The Facebook story is unremarkable in that respect: when bad side effects emerge, measures are taken to correct them. Often, these measures eliminate bad actors by directly changing their economic incentive (e.g. removing the economic incentive for clickbaits).</p><p>Perhaps we agree on the following:</p><p>(0) not all consequences of a fixed set of incentives can be predicted.</p><p>(1) because of that, objectives functions must be updatable.</p><p>(2) they must be updated to correct bad effect whenever they emerge.</p><p>(3) there should be an easy way to train minor aspects of objective functions through simple interaction (similar to the process of educating children), as opposed to programmatic means.</p><p>Perhaps where we disagree is the risk of inadvertently producing systems with badly-designed and (somehow) un-modifiable objectives that would be powerful enough to constitute existential threats.</p><p><strong>Yoshua Bengio:</strong> @Yann LeCun this is true, but one aspect which concerns me (and others) is the gradual increase in power of some agents (now mostly large companies and some governments, potentially some AI systems in the future). When it was just weak humans the cost of mistakes or value misalignment (improper laws, misaligned objective function) was always very limited and local. As we build more and more powerful and intelligent tools and organizations, (1) it becomes easier to cheat for &apos;smarter&apos; agents (exploit the misalignment) and (2) the cost of these misalignments becomes greater, potentially threatening the whole of society. This then does not leave much time and warning to react to value misalignment.</p>",Benito,benito,Ben Pace,

Aren't those more important and more exciting? And for AGI, in particular, many of the skills required seem related.</blockquote><blockquote>They certainly are important and exciting subjects. What's more, at present AGI and BCI are far more fashionable (and better funded). As a reader, you may be rolling your eyes, supposing our thinking here is pre-determined: we wouldn't be writing this essay if we didn't favor work on tools for thought. But these are questions we've wrestled hard with in deciding how to spend our own lives. One of us wrote a book about artificial intelligence before deciding to focus primarily on tools for thought; it was not a decision made lightly, and it's one he revisits from time to time. Indeed, given the ongoing excitement about AGI and BCI, it would be surprising if people working on tools for thought didn't regularly have a little voice inside their head saying “hey, shouldn't you be over there instead?” Fashion is seductive.</blockquote><blockquote>One striking difference is that AGI and BCI are based on relatively specific, well-defined goals. By contrast, work on tools for thought is much less clearly defined. For the most part we can't point to well-defined, long-range goals; rather, we have long-range visions and aspirations, almost evocations. The work is really about exploration of an open-ended question: how can we develop tools that change and expand the range of thoughts human beings can think?</blockquote><blockquote>Culturally, tech is dominated by an engineering, goal-driven mindset. It's much easier to set KPIs, evaluate OKRs, and manage deliverables, when you have a very specific end-goal in mind. And so it's perhaps not surprising that tech culture is much more sympathetic to AGI and BCI as overall programs of work.</blockquote><blockquote>But historically it's not the case that humanity's biggest breakthroughs have come about in this goal-driven way. The creation of language – the ur tool for thought – is perhaps the most important occurrence of humanity's existence. And although the origin of language is hotly debated and uncertain, it seems extremely unlikely to have been the result of a goal-driven process. It's amusing to try imagining some prehistoric quarterly OKRs leading to the development of language. What sort of goals could one possibly set? Perhaps a quota of new irregular verbs? It's inconceivable!</blockquote><blockquote>Similarly, the invention of other tools for thought – writing, the printing press, and so on – are among our greatest ever breakthroughs. And, as far as we know, all emerged primarily out of open-ended exploration, not in a primarily goal-driven way. </blockquote><blockquote>Even the computer itself came out of an exploration that would be regarded as ridiculously speculative and poorly-defined in tech today. Someone didn't sit down and think “I need to invent the computer”; that's not a thought they had any frame of reference for. Rather, pioneers such as Alan Turing and Alonzo Church were exploring extremely basic and fundamental (and seemingly esoteric) questions about logic, mathematics, and the nature of what is provable. Out of those explorations the idea of a computer emerged, after many years; it was a discovered concept, not a goal. Fundamental, open-ended questions seem to be at least as good a source of breakthroughs as goals, no matter how ambitious. This is difficult to imagine or convince others of in Silicon Valley's goal-driven culture. Indeed, we ourselves feel the attraction of a goal-driven culture. But empirically open-ended exploration can be just as, or more successful.</blockquote>",ioannes_shade,ioannes_shade,ioannes,

This post contains the list of grant recipients for Q3 2019, as well as some of the reasoning behind the grants. Most of the funding for these grants has already been distributed to the recipients.</p><p>In the writeups below, we explain the purpose for each grant and summarize our reasoning behind their recommendation. Each summary is written by the fund manager who was most excited about recommending the relevant grant (with a few exceptions that we've noted below). These differ a lot in length, based on how much available time the different fund members had to explain their reasoning.</p><p>When we’ve shared excerpts from an application, those excerpts may have been lightly edited for context or clarity.</p><h1>Grant Recipients</h1><h2>Grants Made By the Long-Term Future Fund</h2><p>Each grant recipient is followed by the size of the grant and their one-sentence description of their project.

The Long-Term Future Fund recommended grants to them, but did not end up funding them. We sometimes create write-ups for these applicants and include them in our reports in order to provide readers with better information on the types of grants we like to recommend.</p><ul><li><strong>Center for Applied Rationality ($150,000):</strong> Help promising people to reason more effectively and find high-impact work, such as reducing x-risk.</li></ul><p>Two grants we recommended but did not write up:</p><ul><li>Jake Coble, who requested $10,000 to do some work with Simon Beard of CSER. This grant request came with an early deadline, so we made the recommendation earlier in the grant cycle. However, after our recommendation went out, Jake found a different project he preferred, and no longer required funding.</li><li>We recommended another individual for a grant, but they wound up accepting funding from another source. (They requested that we not share their name; we would have shared this information had they received funding from us.)</li></ul><h1>Writeups by Helen Toner</h1><h2>Samuel Hilton, on behalf of the HIPE team ($60,000)</h2><blockquote><em><strong>Placing a staff member within the government, to support civil servants to do the most good they can.</strong></em></blockquote><p>This grant supports HIPE (<a href=""https://hipe.org.uk/"">https://hipe.org.uk</a>), a UK-based organization that helps civil servants to have high-impact careers. HIPE’s primary activities are researching how to have a positive impact in the UK government; disseminating their findings via workshops, blog posts, etc.; and providing one-on-one support to interested individuals.</p><p>HIPE has so far been entirely volunteer-run. This grant funds part of the cost of a full-time staff member for two years, plus some office and travel costs.</p><p>Our reasoning for making this grant is based on our impression that HIPE has already been able to gain some traction as a volunteer organization, and on the fact that they now have the opportunity to place a full-time staff member within the Cabinet Office. We see this both as a promising opportunity in its own right, and also as a positive signal about the engagement HIPE has been able to create so far. The fact that the Cabinet Office is willing to provide desk space and cover part of the overhead cost for the staff member suggests that HIPE is engaging successfully with its core audiences.</p><p>HIPE does not yet have robust ways of tracking its impact, but they expressed strong interest in improving their impact tracking over time. We would hope to see a more fleshed-out impact evaluation if we were asked to renew this grant in the future.</p><p>I’ll add that I (Helen) personally see promise in the idea of services that offer career discussion, coaching, and mentoring in more specialized settings. (Other fund members may agree with this, but it was not part of our discussion when deciding whether to make this grant, so I’m not sure.)</p><h1>Writeups by Alex Zhu</h1><h2>Stag Lynn ($23,000)</h2><blockquote><strong><em>To spend the next year leveling up various technical skills with the goal of becoming more impactful in AI safety</em></strong></blockquote><p>Stag’s current intention is to spend the next year improving his skills in a variety of areas (e.g. programming, theoretical neuroscience, and game theory) with the goal of contributing to AI safety research, meeting relevant people in the x-risk community, and helping out in EA/rationality related contexts wherever he can (eg, at rationality summer camps like SPARC and ESPR).</p><p>Two projects he may pursue during the year:</p><ul><li>Working to implement <a href=""https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/yNn2o3kEhixZHkRga/certificates-of-impact"">certificates of impact</a> in the EA/X-risk community, in the hope of encouraging coordination between funders with different values and increasing transparency around the contributions of different people to impactful projects.</li><li>Working as an unpaid personal assistant to someone in EA who is sufficiently busy for this form of assistance to be useful, and sufficiently productive for the assistance to be valuable.</li></ul><p>I recommended funding Stag because I think he is smart, productive, and altruistic, has a track record of doing useful work, and will contribute more usefully to reducing existential risk by directly developing his capabilities and embedding himself in the EA community than he would by finishing his undergraduate degree or working a full-time job. While I’m not yet clear on what projects he will pursue, I think it’s likely that the end result will be very valuable — projects like impact certificates require substantial work from someone with technical and executional skills, and Stag seems to me to fit the bill.</p><p><strong>More on Stag’s background:</strong> In high school, Stag had top finishes in various Latvian and European Olympiads, including a gold medal in the 2015 Latvian Olympiad in Mathematics. Stag has also previously taken the initiative to work on EA causes -- for example, he joined two other people in Latvia in attempting to create the Latvian chapter of Effective Altruism (which reached the point of creating a <a href=""http://www.ealatvia.org/"">Latvian-language website</a>), and he has volunteered to take on major responsibilities in future iterations of the European Summer Program in Rationality (which introduces promising high-school students to effective altruism).</p><p><strong>Potential conflict of interest:</strong> at the time of making the grant, Stag was living with me and helping me with various odd jobs, as part of his plan to meet people in the EA community and help out where he could. This arrangement lasted for about 1.5 months. To compensate for this potential issue, I’ve included notes on Stag from Oliver Habryka, another fund manager.</p><h2>Oliver Habryka’s comments on Stag Lynn</h2><p>I’ve interacted with Stag in the past and have broadly positive impressions of him, in particular his capacity for independent strategic thinking</p><p>Stag has achieved a high level of success in Latvian and Galois Mathematical Olympiads. I generally think that success in these competitions is one of the best predictors we have of a person’s future performance on making intellectual progress on core issues in AI safety. See also my comments and discussion on <a href=""https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/CJJDwgyqT4gXktq6g/long-term-future-fund-april-2019-grant-recommendations#How_good_of_a_target_group_are_Math_Olympiad_winners_for_these_effects_"">the grant to Misha Yagudin last round</a>.</p><p>Stag has also contributed significantly to improving both <a href=""https://espr-camp.org/"">ESPR</a> and <a href=""https://sparc-camp.org/"">SPARC</a> , both of which introduce talented pre-college students to core ideas in EA and AI safety. In particular, he’s helped the programs find and select strong participants, while suggesting curriculum changes that gave them more opportunities to think independently about important issues. This gives me a positive impression of Stag’s ability to contribute to other projects in the space. (I also consider ESPR and SPARC to be among the most cost-effective ways to get more excellent people interested in working on topics of relevance to the long-term future, and take this as another signal of Stag’s talent at selecting and/or improving projects.)</p><h2>Roam Research ($10,000)</h2><blockquote><em><strong>Workflowy, but with much more power to organize your thoughts and collaborate with others.</strong></em></blockquote><p><a href=""https://roamresearch.com/"">Roam</a> is a web application which automates the <a href=""https://zettelkasten.de/posts/your-first-note/"">Zettelkasten method</a>, a note-taking / document-drafting process based on physical index cards. While it is difficult to start using the system, those who do often find it extremely helpful, including a researcher at MIRI who claims that the method doubled his research productivity.</p><p>On my inside view, if Roam succeeds, an experienced user of the note-taking app <a href=""https://workflowy.com/"">Workflowy</a> will get at least as much value switching to Roam as they got from using Workflowy in the first place. (Many EAs, myself included, see Workflowy as an integral part of our intellectual process, and I think Roam might become even more integral than Workflowy. See also <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/sarah.constantin.543/posts/242611079943317"">Sarah Constantin’s review of Roam</a>, which describes Roam as being potentially as “profound a mental prosthetic as hypertext”, and her <a href=""http://srconstantin.posthaven.com/how-to-make-a-memex"">more recent endorsement of Roam</a>.)</p><p>Over the course of the last year, I’ve had intermittent conversations with Conor White-Sullivan, Roam’s CEO, about the app. I started out in a position of skepticism: I doubted that Roam would ever have active users, let alone succeed at its stated mission. After a recent update call with Conor about his LTF Fund application, I was encouraged enough by Roam’s most recent progress, and sufficiently convinced of the possible upsides of its possible success, that I decided to recommend a grant to Roam.</p><p>Since then, Roam has developed enough as a product that I’ve personally switched from Workflowy to Roam and now recommend Roam to my friends. Roam’s progress on its product, combined with its growing base of active users, has led me to feel significantly more optimistic about Roam succeeding at its mission.</p><p>(This funding will support Roam’s general operating costs, including expenses for Conor, one employee, and several contractors.)</p><p><strong>Potential conflict of interest:</strong> Conor is a friend of mine, and I was once his housemate for a few months.</p><h2>Alexander Gietelink Oldenziel ($30,000)</h2><blockquote><em><strong>Independent AI Safety thinking, doing research in aspects of self-reference in using techniques from type theory, topos theory and category theory more generally.</strong></em></blockquote><p>In our previous round of grants, we funded MIRI as an organization: see our <a href=""https://app.effectivealtruism.org/funds/far-future/payouts/6vDsjtUyDdvBa3sNeoNVvl"">April report</a>for a detailed explanation of why we chose to support their work. I think Alexander’s research directions could lead to significant progress on MIRI’s research agenda — in fact, MIRI was sufficiently impressed by his work that they offered him an internship. I have also spoken to him in some depth, and was impressed both by his research taste and clarity of thought.</p><p>After the internship ends, I think it will be valuable for Alexander to have additional funding to dig deeper into these topics; I expect this grant to support roughly 1.5 years of research. During this time, he will have regular contact with researchers at MIRI, reporting on his research progress and receiving feedback.</p><h2>Alexander Siegenfeld ($20,000)</h2><blockquote><em><strong>Characterizing the properties and constraints of complex systems and their external interactions.</strong></em></blockquote><p>Alexander is a 5th-year graduate student in physics at MIT, and he wants to conduct independent <a href=""https://intelligence.org/2018/11/22/2018-update-our-new-research-directions/#section2"">deconfusion research</a> for AI safety. His goal is to get a better conceptual understanding of <a href=""https://intelligence.org/files/TechnicalAgenda.pdf"">multi-level world models</a> by coming up with better formalisms for analyzing complex systems at differing levels of scale, building off of the <a href=""https://necsi.edu/why-complexity-is-different"">work of Yaneer Bar-Yam</a>. (Yaneer is Alexander’s advisor, and the president of the <a href=""https://necsi.edu/about"">New England Complex Science Institute</a>.)</p><p>I decided to recommend funding to Alexander because I think his research directions are promising, and because I was personally impressed by his technical abilities and his clarity of thought. Tsvi Benson-Tilsen, a MIRI researcher, was also impressed enough by Alexander to recommend that the Fund support him. Alexander plans to publish a paper on his research; it will be evaluated by researchers at MIRI, helping him decide how best to pursue further work in this area.</p><p><strong>Potential conflict of interest:</strong> Alexander and I have been friends since our undergraduate years at MIT.</p><h1>Writeups by Oliver Habryka</h1><p>I have a sense that funders in EA, usually due to time constraints, tend to give little feedback to organizations they fund (or decide not to fund). In my writeups below, I tried to be as transparent as possible in explaining the reasons for why I came to believe that each grant was a good idea, my greatest uncertainties and/or concerns with each grant, and some background models I use to evaluate grants. (I hope this last item will help others better understand my future decisions in this space.)</p><p>I think that there exist more publicly defensible (or easier to understand) arguments for some of the grants that I recommended. However, I tried to explain the actual models that drove my decisions for these grants, which are often hard to summarize in a few paragraphs. I apologize in advance that some of the explanations below are probably difficult to understand.</p><p><strong>Thoughts on grant selection and grant incentives</strong></p><p>Some higher-level points on many of the grants below, as well as many grants from last round:</p><p>For almost every grant we make, I have a lot of opinions and thoughts about how the applicant(s) could achieve their aims better. I also have a lot of ideas for projects that I would prefer to fund over the grants we are actually making.</p><p>However, in the current structure of the LTFF, I primarily have the ability to select potential grantees from an established pool, rather than encouraging the creation of new projects. Alongside my time constraints, this means that I have a very limited ability to contribute to the projects with my own thoughts and models.</p><p>Additionally, I spend a lot of time thinking independently about these areas, and have a broad view of “ideal projects that could be made to exist.” This means that for many of the grants I am recommending, it is not usually the case that I think the projects are very good on all the relevant dimensions; I can see how they fall short of my “ideal” projects. More frequently, the projects I fund are among the only available projects in a reference class I believe to be important, and I recommend them because I want projects of that type to receive more resources (and because they pass a moderate bar for quality).</p><p>Some examples:</p><ul><li><a href=""https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/CJJDwgyqT4gXktq6g/long-term-future-fund-april-2019-grant-recommendations#Vyacheslav_Matyuhin___50_000__"">Our grant to the Kocherga community space</a> club last round. I see Kocherga as the only promising project trying to build infrastructure that helps people pursue projects related to x-risk and rationality in Russia.</li><li>I recommended this round’s grant to Miranda partly because I think Miranda's plans are good and I think her past work in this domain and others is of high quality, but also because she is the only person who applied with a project in a domain that seems promising and neglected (using fiction to communicate otherwise hard-to-explain ideas relating to x-risk and how to work on difficult problems).</li><li>In the <a href=""https://app.effectivealtruism.org/funds/far-future/payouts/3JnNTzhJQsu4yQAYcKceSi"">November 2018 grant round</a>, I recommended a grant to Orpheus Lummis to run an AI safety unconference in Montreal. This is because I think he had a great idea, and would create a lot of value even if he ran the events only moderately well. This isn’t the same as believing Orpheus has excellent skills in the relevant domain; I can imagine other applicants who I’d have been more excited to fund, had they applied.</li></ul><p>I am, overall, still very excited about the grants below, and I think they are a much better use of resources than what I think of as the most common counterfactuals to donating to the LTFF fund (e.g. donating to the largest organizations in the space, donating based on time-limited personal research) .</p><p>However, related to the points I made above, I will have many criticisms of almost all the projects that receive funding from us. I think that my criticisms are valid, but readers shouldn't interpret them to mean that I have a negative impression of the grants we are making — which are strong despite their flaws. Aggregating my individual (and frequently critical) recommendations will not give readers an accurate impression of my overall (highly positive) view of the grant round.</p><p>(If I ever come to think that the pool of valuable grants has dried up, I will say so in a high-level note like this one.)</p><p>I can imagine that in the future I might want to invest more resources into writing up lists of potential projects that I would be excited about, though it is also not clear to me that I want people to optimize too much for what I am excited about, and think that the current balance of ""things that I think are exciting, and that people feel internally motivated to do and generated their own plans for"" seems pretty decent.</p><p>To follow up the above with a high-level assessment, I am slightly less excited about this round’s grants than I am about last round’s, and I’d estimate (very roughly) that this round is about 25% less cost-effective than the previous round.</p><p><strong>Acknowledgements</strong></p><p>For both this round and the last round, I wrote the writeups in collaboration with Ben Pace, who works with me on LessWrong and the <a href=""https://alignmentforum.org/"">Alignment Forum</a>. After an extensive discussion about the grants and the Fund's reasoning for them, we split the grants between us and independently wrote initial drafts. We then iterated on those drafts until they accurately described my thinking about them and the relevant domains.</p><p>I am also grateful for Aaron Gertler’s help with editing and refining these writeups, which has substantially increased their clarity.</p><h2>Sören M ($36,982)</h2><blockquote><em><strong>Additional funding for an AI strategy PhD at Oxford / FHI</strong></em><a href=""https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/""> </a><em><strong>to improve my research productivity.</strong></em></blockquote><blockquote>I'm looking for additional funding to supplement my 15k pound/y PhD stipend for 3-4 years from September 2019. I am hoping to roughly double this. My PhD is at Oxford in machine learning, but co-supervised by Allan Dafoe from FHI so that I can focus on AI strategy. We will have multiple joint meetings each month, and I will have a desk at FHI.</blockquote><blockquote>The purpose is to increase my productivity and happiness. Given my expected financial situation, I currently have to make compromises on e. g. Ubers, Soylent, eating out with colleagues, accommodation, quality and waiting times for health care, spending time comparing prices, travel durations and stress, and eating less healthily.</blockquote><blockquote>I expect that more financial security would increase my own productivity and the effectiveness of the time invested by my supervisors.</blockquote><p>I think that when FHI or other organizations in that reference class have trouble doing certain things due to logistical obstacles, we should usually step in and fill those gaps (e.g. see <a href=""https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/CJJDwgyqT4gXktq6g/long-term-future-fund-april-2019-grant-recommendations#Jacob_Lagerros___27_000__"">Jacob L’ grant</a> from last round). My sense is that FHI has trouble with providing funding in situations like this (due to budgetary constraints imposed by Oxford University).</p><p>I’ve interacted with Sören in the past (during my work at CEA), and generally have positive impressions of him in a variety of domains, like his basic thinking about AI Alignment, and his general competence from running projects like the EA Newsletter.</p><p>I have a lot of trust in the judgment of Nick Bostrom and several other researchers at FHI. I am not currently very excited about the work at GovAI (the team that Allan Dafoe leads), but still have enough trust in many of the relevant decision makers to think that it is very likely that Soeren should be supported in his work.</p><p>In general, I think many of the salaries for people working on existential risk are low enough that they have to make major tradeoffs in order to deal with the resulting financial constraints. I think that increasing salaries in situations like this is a good idea (though I am hesitant about increasing salaries for other types of jobs, for a variety of reasons I won’t go into here, but am happy to expand on).</p><p>This funding should last for about 2 years of Sören’s time at Oxford.</p><h2>AI Safety Camp ($41,000)</h2><blockquote><em><strong>A research experience program for prospective AI safety researchers.</strong></em></blockquote><blockquote>We want to organize the 4th AI Safety Camp (AISC) - a research retreat and program for prospective AI safety researchers. Compared to past iterations, we plan to change the format to include a 3 to 4-day project generation period and team formation workshop, followed by a several-week period of online team collaboration on concrete research questions, a 6 to 7-day intensive research retreat, and ongoing mentoring after the camp. The target capacity is 25 - 30 participants, with projects that range from technical AI safety (majority) to policy and strategy research. More information about past camps is at <a href=""https://aisafetycamp.com/"">https://aisafetycamp.com/</a></blockquote><blockquote>[...]</blockquote><blockquote>Early-career entry stage seems to be a less well-covered part of the talent pipeline, especially in Europe. Individual mentoring is costly from the standpoint of expert advisors (esp. compared to guided team work), while internships and e.g. MSFP have limited capacity and are US-centric. After the camp, we advise and encourage participants on future career steps and help connect them to other organizations, or direct them to further individual work and learning if they are pursuing an academic track..</blockquote><blockquote>Overviews of previous research projects from the first 2 camps can be found here:</blockquote><blockquote>1- http://bit.ly/2FFFcK1</blockquote><blockquote>2- http://bit.ly/2KKjPLB</blockquote><blockquote>Projects from AISC3 are still in progress and there is no public summary.</blockquote><blockquote>To evaluate the camp, we send out an evaluation form directly after the camp has concluded and then informally follow the career decisions, publications, and other AI safety/EA involvement of the participants. We plan to conduct a larger survey from past AISC participants later in 2019 to evaluate our mid-term impact. We expect to get a more comprehensive picture of the impact, but it is difficult to evaluate counterfactuals and indirect effects (e.g. networking effects). The (anecdotal) positive examples we attribute to past camps include the acceleration of entrance of several people in the field, research outputs that include 2 conference papers, several SW projects, and about 10 blogposts.</blockquote><blockquote>The main direct costs of the camp are the opportunity costs of participants, organizers and advisors. There are also downside risks associated with personal conflicts at multi-day retreats and discouraging capable people from the field if the camp is run poorly. We actively work to prevent this by providing both on-site and external anonymous contact points, as well as actively attending to participant well-being, including during the online phases.</blockquote><p>This grant is for the AI Safety Camp, to which we made a <a href=""https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/CJJDwgyqT4gXktq6g/long-term-future-fund-april-2019-grant-recommendations#Johannes_Heidecke___25_000__"">grant in the last round</a>. Of the grants I recommended this round, I am most uncertain about this one. The primary reason is that I have not received much evidence about the performance of either of the last two camps[1], and I assign at least some probability that the camps are not facilitating very much good work. (This is mostly because I have low expectations for the quality of most work of this kind and haven’t looked closely enough at the camp to override these — not because I have positive evidence that they produce low-quality work.)</p><p>My biggest concern is that the camps do not provide a sufficient level of feedback and mentorship for the attendees. When I try to predict how well I’d expect a research retreat like the AI Safety Camp to go, much of the impact hinges on putting attendees into contact with more experienced researchers and having a good mentoring setup. Some of the problems I have with the output from the AI Safety Camp seem like they could be explained by a lack of mentorship.</p><p>From the evidence I observe on their website, I see that the attendees of the second camp all produced an artifact of their research (e.g. an academic writeup or code repository). I think this is a very positive sign. That said, it doesn’t look like any alignment researchers have commented on any of this work (this may in part have been because most of it was presented in formats that require a lot of time to engage with, such as GitHub repositories), so I’m not sure the output actually lead to the participants to get any feedback on their research directions, which is one of the most important things for people new to the field.</p><p>After some followup discussion with the organizers, I heard about changes to the upcoming camp (the target of this grant) that address some of the above concerns (independent of my feedback). In particular, the camp is being renamed to “AI Safety Research Program”, and is now split into two parts — a topic selection workshop and a research retreat, with experienced AI Alignment researchers attending the workshop. The format change seems likely to be a good idea, and makes me more optimistic about this grant.</p><p>I generally think hackathons and retreats for researchers can be very valuable, allowing for focused thinking in a new environment. I think the AI Safety Camp is held at a relatively low cost, in a part of the world (Europe) where there exist few other opportunities for potential new researchers to spend time thinking about these topics, and some promising people have attended. I hope that the camps are going well, but I will not fund another one without spending significantly more time investigating the program.</p><p><strong>Footnotes</strong></p><p>[1] After signing off on this grant, I found out that, due to overlap between the organizers of the events, some feedback I got about this camp was actually feedback about the <a href=""http://humanaligned.ai/"">Human Aligned AI Summer School</a>, which means that I had even less information than I thought. <a href=""https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/CJJDwgyqT4gXktq6g/long-term-future-fund-april-2019-grant-recommendations#Johannes_Heidecke___25_000__"">In April</a> I said I wanted to talk with the organizers before renewing this grant, and I expected to have at least six months between applications from them, but we received another application this round and I ended up not having time for that conversation.</p><h2>Miranda Dixon-Luinenburg ($13,500)</h2><blockquote><em><strong>Writing EA-themed fiction that addresses X-risk topics.</strong></em></blockquote><blockquote>I want to spend three months evaluating my ability to produce an original work that explores existential risk, rationality, EA, and related themes such as coordination between people with different beliefs and backgrounds, handling burnout, planning on long timescales, growth mindset, etc. I predict that completing a high-quality novel of this type would take ~12 months, so 3 months is just an initial test.</blockquote><blockquote>In 3 months, I would hope to produce a detailed outline of an original work plus several completed chapters. Simultaneously, I would be evaluating whether writing full-time is a good fit for me in terms of motivation and personal wellbeing.</blockquote><blockquote>[...]</blockquote><blockquote>I have spent the last 2 years writing an EA-themed fanfiction of The Last Herald-Mage trilogy by Mercedes Lackey (online at https://archiveofourown.org/series/936480). In this period I have completed 9 “books” of the series, totalling 1.2M words (average of 60K words/month), mostly while I was also working full-time. (I am currently writing the final arc, and when I finish, hope to create a shorter abridged/edited version with a more solid beginning and better pacing overall.)</blockquote><blockquote>In the writing process, I researched key background topics, in particular AI safety work (I read a number of Arbital articles and most of this MIRI paper on decision theory: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.05060v1.pdf), as well as ethics, mental health, organizational best practices, medieval history and economics, etc. I have accumulated a very dedicated group of around 10 beta readers, all EAs, who read early drafts of each section and give feedback on how well it addresses various topics, which gives me more confidence that I am portraying these concepts accurately.</blockquote><p>One natural decomposition of whether this grant is a good idea is to first ask whether writing fiction of this type is valuable, then whether Miranda is capable of actually creating that type of fiction, and last whether funding Miranda will make a significant difference in the amount/quality of her fiction.</p><p>I think that many people reading this will be surprised or confused about this grant. I feel fairly confident that grants of this type are well worth considering, and I am interested in funding more projects like this in the future, so I’ve tried my best to summarize my reasoning. I do think there are some good arguments for why we should be hesitant to do so (partly summarized by the section below that lists things that I think fiction doesn’t do as well as non-fiction), so while I think that grants like this are quite important, and have the potential to do a significant amount of good, I can imagine changing my mind about this in the future.</p><p><strong>The track record of fiction</strong></p><p>In a general sense, I think that fiction has a pretty strong track record of both being successful at conveying important ideas, and being a good attractor of talent and other resources. I also think that good fiction is often necessary to establish shared norms and shared language.</p><p>Here are some examples of communities and institutions that I think used fiction very centrally in their function. Note that after the first example, I am making no claim that the effect was good, I’m just establishing the magnitude of the potential effect size.</p><ul><li>Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality (HPMOR) was instrumental in the growth and development of both the EA and Rationality communities. It is very likely the single most important recruitment mechanism for productive AI alignment researchers, and has also drawn many other people to work on the broader aims of the EA and Rationality communities.</li><li>Fiction was a core part of the strategy of the neoliberal movement; fiction writers were among the groups referred to by Hayek as ""secondhand dealers in ideas.” An example of someone whose fiction played both a large role in the rise of neoliberalism and in its eventual spread would be Ayn Rand.</li><li>Almost every major religion, culture and nation-state is built on shared myths and stories, usually fictional (though the stories are often held to be true by the groups in question, making this data point a bit more confusing).</li><li>Francis Bacon’s (unfinished) utopian novel “The New Atlantis” is often cited as the primary inspiration for the founding of the Royal Society, which may have been the single institution with the greatest influence on the progress of the scientific revolution.</li></ul><p>On a more conceptual level, I think fiction tends to be particularly good at achieving the following aims (compared to non-fiction writing):</p><ul><li>Teaching low-level cognitive patterns by displaying characters that follow those patterns, allowing the reader to learn from very concrete examples set in a fictional world. (Compare Aesop’s Fables to some nonfiction book of moral precepts — it can be much easier to remember good habits when we attach them to characters.)</li><li>Establishing norms, by having stories that display the consequences of not following certain norms, and the rewards of following them in the right way</li><li>Establishing a common language, by not only explaining concepts, but also showing concepts as they are used, and how they are brought up in conversational context</li><li>Establishing common goals, by creating concrete utopian visions of possible features that motivate people to work towards them together</li><li>Reaching a broader audience, since we naturally find stories more exciting than abstract descriptions of concepts</li></ul><p>(I wrote in more detail about <a href=""https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/CJJDwgyqT4gXktq6g/long-term-future-fund-april-2019-grant-recommendations#What_effects_does_reading_HPMOR_have_on_people_"">how this works for HPMOR</a> in the last grant round.)</p><p>In contrast, here are some things that fiction is generally worse at (though a lot of these depend on context; since fiction often contains embedded non-fiction explanations, some of these can be overcome):</p><ul><li>Carefully evaluating ideas, in particular when evaluating them requires empirical data. There is a norm against showing graphs or tables in fiction books, making any explanation that rests on that kind of data difficult to access in fiction.</li><li>Conveying precise technical definitions</li><li>Engaging in dialogue with other writers and researchers</li><li>Dealing with topics in which readers tend to come to better conclusions by mentally distancing themselves from the problem at hand, instead of engaging with concrete visceral examples (I think some ethical topics like the trolley problem qualify here, as well as problems that require mathematical concepts that don’t neatly correspond to easy real-world examples)</li></ul><p>Overall, I think current writing about both existential risk, rationality, and effective altruism skews too much towards non-fiction, so I’m excited about experimenting with funding fiction writing.</p><p><strong>Miranda’s writing</strong></p><p>The second question is whether I trust Miranda to actually be able to write fiction that leverages these opportunities and provides value. This is why I think Miranda can do a good job:</p><ul><li>Her current fiction project is read by a few people whose taste I trust, and many of them describe having developed valuable skills or insights as a result (for example, better skills for crisis management, a better conception of moral philosophy, an improved moral compass, and some insights about decision theory)</li><li>She wrote frequently on LessWrong and her blog for a few years, producing content of consistently high quality that, while not fictional, often displayed some of the same useful properties as fiction writing.</li><li>I’ve seen her execute a large variety of difficult projects outside of her writing, which means I am a lot more optimistic about things like her ability to motivate herself on this project, and excelling in the non-writing aspects of the work (e.g. promoting her fiction to audiences beyond the EA and rationality communities)</li><ul><li>She worked in operations at CEA and received strong reviews from her coworkers</li><li>She helped CFAR run the operations for SPARC in two consecutive years and performed well as a logistics volunteer for 11 of their other workshops</li><li>I’ve seen her organize various events and provide useful help with logistics and general problem-solving on a large number of occasions</li></ul></ul><p>My two biggest concerns are:</p><ul><li>Miranda losing motivation to work on this project, because writing fiction with a specific goal requires a significantly different motivation than doing it for personal enjoyment</li><li>The fiction being well-written and engaging, but failing to actually help people better understand the important issues it tries to cover.</li></ul><p>I like the fact that this grant is for an exploratory 3 months rather than a longer period of time; this allows Miranda to pivot if it doesn’t work out, rather than being tied to a project that isn’t going well.</p><p><strong>The counterfactual value of funding</strong></p><p>It would be reasonable to ask whether a grant is really necessary, given that Miranda has produced a huge amount of fiction in the last two years without receiving funding explicitly dedicated to that. I have two thoughts here:</p><ol type=""1""><li>I generally think that we should avoid declining to pay people just because they’d be willing to do valuable work for free. It seems good to reward people for work even if this doesn’t make much of a difference in the quality/consistency of the work, because I expect this promise of reward to help people build long-term motivation and encourage exploration.</li><ol type=""a""><li>To explain this a bit more, I think this grant will help other people build motivation towards pursuing similar projects in the future, by setting a precedent for potential funding in this space. For example, I think the possibility of funding (and recognition) was also a motivator for Miranda in starting to work on this project.</li></ol><li>I expect this grant to have a significant effect on Miranda’s productivity, because I think that there is often a qualitative difference between work someone produces in their spare time and work that someone can focus full-time on. In particular, I expect this grant to cause Miranda’s work to improve in the dimensions that she doesn’t naturally find very stimulating, which I expect will include editing, restructuring, and other forms of “polish”.</li></ol><h2>David Manheim ($30,000)</h2><blockquote><em><strong>Multi-model approach to corporate and state actors relevant to existential risk mitigation.</strong></em></blockquote><blockquote>Work for 2-3 months on continuing to build out a multi-model approach to understanding international relations and multi-stakeholder dynamics as it relates to risks of strong(er) AI systems development, based on and extending similar work done on biological weapons risks done on behalf of FHI's Biorisk group and supporting Open Philanthropy Project planning.</blockquote><blockquote>This work is likely to help policy and decision analysis for effective altruism related to the deeply uncertain and complex issues in international relations and long term planning that need to be considered for many existential risk mitigation activities. While the project is focused on understanding actors and motivations in the short term, the decisions being supported are exactly those that are critical for existential risk mitigation, with long term implications for the future.</blockquote><p>I feel a lot of skepticism toward much of the work done in the academic study of international relations. Judging from my models of political influence and its effects on the quality of intellectual contributions, and my models of research fields with little ability to perform experiments, I have high priors that work in international relations is of significantly lower quality than in most scientific fields. However, I have engaged relatively little with actual research on the topic of international relations (outside of unusual scholars like Nick Bostrom) and so am hesitant in my judgement here.</p><p>I also have a fair bit of worry around biorisk. I haven’t really had the opportunity to engage with a good case for it, and neither have many of the people I would trust most in this space, in large part due to secrecy concerns from people who work on it (more on that below). Due to this, I am worried about <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/2uDBJWCksvzhDzHGf/understanding-information-cascades"">information cascades</a>. (An information cascade is a situation where people primarily share <em>what</em> they believe but not <em>why</em>, and because people update on each others' beliefs you end up with a lot of people all believing the same thing precisely because everyone else does.)</p><p>I think is valuable to work on biorisk, but this view is mostly based on individual conversations that are hard to summarize, and I feel uncomfortable with my level of understanding of possible interventions, or even just conceptual frameworks I could use to approach the problem. I don’t know how most people who work in this space came to decide it was important, and those I’ve spoken to have usually been reluctant to share details in conversation (e.g. about specific discoveries they think created risk, or types of arguments that convinced them to focus on biorisk over other threats).</p><p>I’m broadly supportive of work done at places like FHI and by the people at OpenPhil who care about x-risks, so I am in favor of funding their work (e.g. Soren’s grant above). But I don’t feel as though I can defer to the people working in this domain on the object level when there is so much secrecy around their epistemic process, because I and others cannot evaluate their reasoning.</p><p>However, I am excited about this grant, because I have a good amount of trust in David’s judgment. To be more specific, he has a track record of identifying important ideas and institutions and then working on/with them. Some concrete examples include:</p><ul><li>Wrote up <a href=""https://intelligence.org/2018/03/27/categorizing-goodhart/"">a paper on Goodhart’s Law</a> with Scott Garrabrant (after seeing Scott’s very terse post on it)</li><li>Works with the biorisk teams at FHI and OpenPhil</li><li>Completed his PhD in public policy and decision theory at the RAND Corporation, which is an unusually innovative institution (e.g. <a href=""http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/05/rand_health_ins.html"">this study</a>);</li><li>Writes interesting comments and blog posts on the internet (e.g. LessWrong)</li><li>Has offered mentoring in his fields of expertise to other people working or preparing to work projects in the x-risk space; I’ve heard positive feedback from his mentees</li></ul><p>Another major factor for me is the degree to which David is shares his thinking openly and transparently on the internet, and participates in public discourse, so that other people interested in these topics can engage with his ideas. (He’s also a superforecaster, which I think is predictive of broadly good judgment.) If David didn’t have this track record of public discourse, I likely wouldn’t be recommending this grant, and if he suddenly stopped participating, I’d be fairly hesitant to recommend such a grant in the future.</p><p>As I said, I’m not excited about the specific project he is proposing, but have trust in his sense of which projects might be good to work on, and I have emphasized to him that I think he should feel comfortable working on the projects he thinks are best. I strongly prefer a world where David has the freedom to work on the projects he judges to be most valuable, compared to the world where he has to take unrelated jobs (e.g. teaching at university).</p><h2>Joar Skalse ($10,000)</h2><blockquote><em><strong>Upskilling in ML in order to be able to do productive AI safety research sooner than otherwise.</strong></em></blockquote><blockquote>I am requesting grant money to upskill in machine learning (ML).</blockquote><blockquote>Background: I am an undergraduate student in Computer Science and Philosophy at Oxford University, about to start the 4th year of a 4-year degree.

I think it is probably the second most important piece of writing on AI alignment that came out in the last 12 months, after the <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/Rm6oQRJJmhGCcLvxh"">Embedded Agency sequence</a>. My current best guess is that this type of conceptual clarification / deconfusion is the most important type of research in AI alignment, and the type of work I’m most interested in funding. While I don’t know exactly how Joar contributed to the paper, my sense is that all the authors put in a significant effort (bar Scott Garrabrant, who played a supervising role).</p><p>This grant is for projects during and in between terms at Oxford. I want to support Joar producing more of this kind of research, which I expect this grant to help with. He’s also been writing further thoughts online (<a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/rvxcSc6wdcCfaX6GZ/two-senses-of-optimizer#comments"">example</a>), which I think has many positive effects (personally and as externalities).</p><p>My brief thoughts on the paper (nontechnical):</p><ul><li>The paper introduced me to a lot of of terminology that I’ve continued to use over the past few months (which is not true for most terminology introduced in this space)</li><li>It helped me deconfuse my thinking on a bunch of concrete problems (in particular on the question of whether things like Alpha Go can be dangerous when “scaled up”)</li><li>I’ve seen multiple other researchers and thinkers I respect refer to it positively</li><li>In addition to being published as a paper, it was written up as a series of blogposts in a way that made it a lot more accessible</li></ul><p>More of my thoughts on the paper (technical):</p><p><em>Note: If you haven’t read the paper, or you don’t have other background in the subject, this section will likely be unclear.

The primary formalism in the paper was clarifying rather than obscuring (and the ratio of insight to formalism was very high - see my addendum below for more thoughts on that).</p><p>Once the basic concepts were in place, clarifying different basic tools that would encourage optimization to happen in either the base optimizer or the mesa optimizer (e.g. constraining and expanding space/time offered to the base or mesa optimizers has interesting effects), plus clarifying the types of alignment / pseudo-alignment / internalizing of the base objective, all helped me think about this issue very clearly. It largely used basic technical language I already knew, and put it together in ways that would’ve taken me many months to achieve on my own - a very helpful conceptual piece of work.</p><h1>Further Writeups by Oliver Habryka</h1><p>The following three grants were more exciting to one or more other fund managers than they were to me. I think that for all three, if it had just been me on the grant committee, we might have not actually made them. However, I had more resources available to invest into these writeups, and as such I ended up summarizing my view on them, instead of someone else on the fund doing so. As such, they are probably less representative of the reasons for why we made these grants than the writeups above.</p><p>In the course of thinking through these grants, I formed (and wrote out below) more detailed, explicit models of the topics. Although these models were not counterfactual in the Fund’s making the grants, I think they are fairly predictive of my future grant recommendations.</p><h2>Chris Chambers ($36,635)</h2><p>Note: Application sent in by Jacob Hilton.</p><blockquote><em><strong>Combat publication bias in science by promoting and supporting the Registered Reports journal format</strong></em></blockquote><blockquote>I'm suggesting a grant to fund a teaching buyout for Professor Chris Chambers, an academic at the University of Cardiff working to promote and support Registered Reports. This funding opportunity was originally identified and researched by Hauke Hillebrandt, who published a full analysis <a href=""https://lets-fund.org/better-science/"">here</a>. In brief, a Registered Report is a format for journal articles where peer review and acceptance decisions happen before data is collected, so that the results are much less susceptible to publication bias. The grant would free Chris of teaching duties so that he can work full-time on trying to get Registered Reports to become part of mainstream science, which includes outreach to journal editors and supporting them through the process of adopting the format for their journal. More details of Chris's plans can be found <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VMOcVci0TSviK5dYCEyS1ZZgvbQxLqPyBwAFeirfg04/edit"">here</a>.</blockquote><p>I think the main reason for funding this is from a worldview diversification perspective: I would expect it to broadly improve the efficiency of scientific research by improving the communication of negative results, and to enable people to make better-informed use of scientific research by reducing publication bias. I would expect these effects to be primarily within fields where empirical tests tend to be useful but not always definitive, such as clinical trials (one of Chris's focus areas), which would have knock-on effects on health.</p><p>From an X-risk perspective, the key question to answer seems to be which technologies differentially benefit from this grant. I do not have a strong opinion on this, but to quote Brian Wang from a <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/groups/effective.altruists/permalink/2056036427786037"">Facebook thread</a>: ""In terms of [...] bio-risk, my initial thoughts are that reproducibility concerns in biology are strongest when it comes to biomedicine, a field that can be broadly viewed as defense-enabling. By contrast, I'm not sure that reproducibility concerns hinder the more fundamental, offense-enabling developments in biology all that much (e.g., the falling costs of gene synthesis, the discovery of CRISPR).""</p><p>As for why this particular intervention strikes me as a cost-effective way to improve science, it is shovel-ready, it may be the sort of thing that traditional funding sources would miss, it has been carefully vetted by Hauke, and I thought that Chris seemed thoughtful and intelligent from his videoed talk.”</p><p><a href=""https://lets-fund.org/better-science/"">The <em>Let’s Fund</em> report</a> linked in the application played a major role in my assessment of the grant, and I probably would not have been comfortable recommending this grant without access to that report.</p><p><strong>Thoughts on Registered Reports</strong></p><p>The replication crisis in psychology, and the broad spread of “career science,” have made it (to me) quite clear that the methodological foundations of at least psychology itself, but possibly also the broader life-sciences, are creating a very large volume of false and likely unreproducible claims.</p><p>This is in large part caused by problematic incentives for individual scientists to engage in highly biased reporting and statistically dubious practices.</p><p>I think preregistration has the opportunity to fix a small but significant part of this problem, primarily by reducing <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publication_bias#Definition"">file-drawer effects</a>. To borrow an explanation from the Let’s Fund report (lightly edited for clarity):</p><blockquote>[Pre-registration] was introduced to address two problems: publication bias and analytical flexibility (in particular outcome switching in the case of clinical medicine).</blockquote><blockquote>Publication bias, also known as the file drawer problem, refers to the fact that many more studies are conducted than published. Studies that obtain positive and novel results are more likely to be published than studies that obtain negative results or report replications of prior results. The consequence is that the published literature indicates stronger evidence for findings than exists in reality.</blockquote><blockquote>Outcome switching refers to the possibility of changing the outcomes of interest in the study depending on the observed results. A researcher may include ten variables that could be considered outcomes of the research, and — once the results are known — intentionally or unintentionally select the subset of outcomes that show statistically significant results as the outcomes of interest. The consequence is an increase in the likelihood that reported results are spurious by leveraging chance, while negative evidence gets ignored.</blockquote><blockquote>This is one of several related research practices that can inflate spurious findings when analysis decisions are made with knowledge of the observed data, such as selection of models, exclusion rules and covariates. Such data-contingent analysis decisions constitute what has become known as P-hacking, and pre-registration can protect against all of these.</blockquote><blockquote>[...]</blockquote><blockquote>It also effectively blinds the researcher to the outcome because the data are not collected yet and the outcomes are not yet known. This way the researcher’s unconscious biases cannot influence the analysis strategy</blockquote><p>“Registered reports” refers to a specific protocol that journals are encouraged to adopt, which integrates preregistration into the journal acceptance process. Illustrated by this picture (borrowed from the Let’s Fund report):</p><span><figure><img src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/YnHX9ZRHunoA9td6K/bg6y4msm5gsh6tz4td6x"" class=""draft-image "" style=""width:100%""></figure></span><p>Of the many ways to implement preregistration practices, I don’t think the one that Chambers proposes seems ideal, and I can see some flaws with it, but I still think that the quality of clinical science (and potentially other fields) will significantly improve if more journals adopt the registered reports protocol. (Please keep this in mind as you read my concerns in the next section.)</p><p><strong>The importance of bandwidth constraints for journals</strong></p><p>Chambers has the explicit goal of making all clinical trials <strong>require</strong> the use of registered reports. That outcome seems potentially quite harmful, and possibly worse than the current state of clinical science. (However, since that current state is very far from “universal registered reports,” I am not very worried about this grant contributing to that scenario.)</p><p>The Let’s Fund report covers the benefits of preregistration pretty well, so I won’t go into much detail here. Instead, I will mention some of my specific concerns with the protocol that Chambers is trying to promote.</p><p>From the <a href=""https://cos.io/rr/"">registered reports website</a>:</p><blockquote>Manuscripts that pass peer review will be issued an in principle acceptance (IPA), indicating that the article will be published pending successful completion of the study according to the exact methods and analytic procedures outlined, as well as a defensible and evidence-bound interpretation of the results.</blockquote><p>This seems unlikely to be the best course of action. I don’t think that the most widely-read journals should only publish replications. The key reason is that many scientific journals are solving a bandwidth constraint - sharing papers that are worth reading, not merely papers that say true things, to help researchers keep up to date with new findings in their field. A math journal could have papers for every true mathematical statement, including trivial ones, but they instead need to focus on true statements that are useful to signal boost to the mathematics community. (Related concepts are the tradeoff between bias and variance in Machine Learning, or accuracy and calibration in forecasting.)</p><p>Ultimately, from a value of information perspective, it is totally possible for a study to only be interesting if it finds a positive result, and to be uninteresting when analyzed pre-publication from the perspective of the editor. It seems better to encourage pre-publication, but still take into account the information value of a paper’s experimental results, even if this doesn’t fully prevent publication bias.</p><p>To give a concrete (and highly simplified) example, imagine a world where you are trying to find an effective treatment for a disease. You don’t have great theory in this space, so you basically have to test 100 plausible treatments. On their own, none of these have a high likelihood of being effective, but you expect that at least one of them will work reasonably well.</p><p>Currently, you would preregister those trials (as is required for clinical trials), and then start performing the studies one by one. Each failure provides relatively little information (since the prior probability was low anyways), so you are unlikely to be able to publish it in a prestigious journal, but you can probably still publish it somewhere. Not many people would hear about it, but it would be findable if someone is looking specifically for evidence about the specific disease you are trying to treat, or the treatment that you tried out. However, finding a successful treatment is highly valuable information which will likely get published in a journal with a lot of readers, causing lots of people to hear about the potential new treatment.</p><p>In a world with mandatory registered reports, none of these studies will be published in a high-readership journal, since journals will be forced to make a decision before they know the outcome of a treatment. Because all 100 studies are equally unpromising, none are likely to pass the high bar of such a journal, and they’ll wind up in obscure publications (if they are published at all) [1]. Thus, even if one of them finds a successful result, few people will hear about it. High-readership journals exist in large part to spread news about valuable results in a limited bandwidth environment; this no longer happens in scenarios of this kind.</p><p>Because of dynamics like this, I think it is very unlikely that any major journals will ever switch towards <em>only</em> publishing registered report-based studies, even within clinical trials, since no journal would want to pass up on the opportunity to publish a study that has the opportunity to revolutionize the field.</p><p><strong>Importance of selecting for clarity</strong></p><p>Here is the full set of criteria that papers are being evaluated by for stage 2 of the registered reports process:</p><blockquote>1. Whether the data are able to test the authors’ proposed hypotheses by satisfying the approved outcome-neutral conditions (such as quality checks or positive controls)</blockquote><blockquote>2. Whether the Introduction, rationale and stated hypotheses are the same as the approved Stage 1 submission (required)</blockquote><blockquote>3. Whether the authors adhered precisely to the registered experimental procedures</blockquote><blockquote>4. Whether any unregistered post hoc analyses added by the authors are justified, methodologically sound, and informative</blockquote><blockquote>5. Whether the authors’ conclusions are justified given the data</blockquote><p>The above list is comprehensive, and does not include any mention of the clarity of the authors’ writing, the quality/rigor of the explanation provided by the paper’s methodology, or the implications of the paper’s findings on underlying theory. (All of these are very important to how journals currently evaluate papers.) This means that journals can only filter for those characteristics in the first stage of the registered reports process, when large parts of the paper haven’t yet been written. As a result, large parts of the paper basically have no selection applied to them for conceptual clarity, as well as thoughtful analysis of implications for future theory, likely resulting in those qualities getting worse.</p><p>I think the goal of registered reports is to split research in two halves where you publish two separate papers, one that is empirical, and another that is purely theoretical, which that takes the results of the first paper as given and explores their consequences. We already see this split a good amount in physics, in which there exists a pretty significant divide between experimental and theoretical physics, the latter of which rarely performs experiments. I don’t know whether encouraging this split in a given field is a net-improvement, since I generally think that a lot of good science comes from combining the gathering of good empirical data with careful analysis and explanations, and I am particularly worried that the analysis of the results in papers published via registered reports will be of particularly low-quality, which encourages the spread of bad explanations and misconceptions which can cause a lot of damage (though some of that is definitely offset by reducing the degree to which scientists can fit hypotheses post-hoc, due to preregistration). The costs here seem related to Chris Olah’s article on <a href=""https://distill.pub/2017/research-debt/"">research debt</a>.</p><p>Again, I think both of these problems are unlikely to become serious issues, because at most I can imagine getting to a world where something between 10% and 30% of top journal publications in a given field have gone through registered reports-based preregistration. I would be deeply surprised if there weren’t alternative outlets for papers that do try to combine the gathering of empirical data with high-quality explanations and analysis.</p><p><strong>Failures due to bureaucracy</strong></p><p>I should also note clinical science is not something I have spent large amounts of time thinking about, that I am quite concerned about adding more red tape and necessary logistical hurdles to jump through when registering clinical trials. I have high uncertainty about the effect of registered reports on the costs of doing small-scale clinical experiments, but it seems more likely than not that they will lengthen the review process, and add additional methodological constraints.</p><p>(There is also a chance that it will reduce these burdens by giving scientists feedback earlier in the process and letting them be more certain of the value of running a particular study. However, this effect seems slightly weaker to me than the additional costs, though I am very uncertain about this.)</p><p>In the current scientific environment, running even a simple clinical study may require millions of dollars of overhead (a related example is detailed in Scott Alexander’s “<a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/08/29/my-irb-nightmare/"">My IRB nightmare</a>”). I believe this barrier is a substantial drag on progress in medical science. In this context, I think that requiring even more mandatory documentation, and adding even more upfront costs, seems very costly. (Though again, it seems highly unlikely for the registered reports format to ever become mandatory on a large scale, and giving more researchers the option to publish a study via the registered reports protocol, depending on their local tradeoffs, seems likely net-positive)</p><p>To summarize these three points:</p><ul><li>If journals have to commit to publishing studies, it’s not obvious to me that this is good, given that they would have to do so without access to important information (e.g. whether a surprising result was found) and only a limited number of slots for publishing papers.</li><li>It seems quite important for journals to be able to select papers based on the clarity of their explanations, both for ease of communication and for conceptual refinement.</li><li>Excessive red tape in clinical research seems like one of the main problems with medical science today, so adding more is worrying, though the sign of the registered reports protocol on this is a bit ambigious</li></ul><p><strong>Differential technological progress</strong></p><p>Let’s Fund covers <a href=""https://concepts.effectivealtruism.org/concepts/differential-progress/"">differential technological progress</a> concerns in their writeup. Key quote:</p><blockquote>One might worry that funding meta-research indiscriminately speeds up all research, including research which carries a lot of risks. However, for the above reasons, we believe that meta-research improves predominantly social science and applied clinical science (“p-value science’) and so has a strong differential technological development element, that hopefully makes society wiser before more risks from technology emerge through innovation. However, there are some reproducibility concerns in harder sciences such as basic biological research and high energy physics that might be sped up by meta-research and thus carry risks from emerging technologies[110].</blockquote><p>My sense is that further progress in sociology and psychology seems net positive from a global catastrophic risk reduction perspective. The case for clinical science seems a bit weaker, but still positive.</p><p>In general, I am more excited about this grant in worlds in which global catastrophes are less immediate and less likely than my usual models suggest, and I’m thinking of this grant in some sense as a hedging bet, in case we live in one of those worlds.</p><p>Overall, a reasonable summary of my position on this grant would be ""I think preregistration helps, but is probably not really attacking the core issues in science. I think this grant is good, because I think it actually makes preregistration a possibility in a large number of journals, though I disagree with Chris Chalmers on whether it would be good for all clinical trials to require preregistration, which I think would be quite bad. On the margin, I support his efforts, but if I ever come to change my mind about this, it’s likely for one or more of the above reasons.""</p><p><strong>Footnotes</strong></p><p>[1]: The journal could also publish a random subset, though at scale that gives rise to the same dynamics, so I’ll ignore that case. It could also batch a large number of the experiments until the expected value of information is above the relevant threshold, though that significantly increases costs.</p><h2>Jess Whittlestone ($75,080)</h2><p>Note: Funding from this grant will go to the Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence, which will fund Jess in turn. The LTF Fund is not replacing funding that CFI would have supplied instead; without this grant, Jess would need to pursue grants from sources outside CFI.</p><blockquote><em><strong>Research on the links between short- and long-term AI policy while skilling up in technical ML.</strong></em></blockquote><blockquote>I’m applying for funding to cover my salary for a year as a postdoc at the Leverhulme CFI, enabling me to do two things:</blockquote><blockquote>-- Research the links between short- and long-term AI policy. My plan is to start broad: thinking about how to approach, frame and prioritise work on ‘short-term’ issues from a long-term perspective, and then focusing in on a more specific issue. I envision two main outputs (papers/reports): (1) reframing various aspects of ‘short-term’ AI policy from a long-term perspective (e.g. highlighting ways that ‘short-term’ issues could have long-term consequences, and ways of working on AI policy today most likely to have a long-run impact); (2) tackling a specific issue in ‘short-term’ AI policy with possible long-term consequences (tbd, but an example might be the possible impact of microtargeting on democracy and epistemic security as AI capabilities advance).</blockquote><blockquote>-- Skill up in technical ML by taking courses from the Cambridge ML masters.</blockquote><blockquote>Most work on long-term impacts of AI focuses on issues arising in the future from AGI. But issues arising in the short term may have long-term consequences: either by directly leading to extreme scenarios (e.g. automated surveillance leading to authoritarianism), or by undermining our capability to deal with other threats (e.g. disinformation undermining collective decision-making). Policy work today will also shape how AI gets developed, deployed and governed, and what issues will arise in the future. We’re at a particularly good time to influence the focus of AI policy, with many countries developing AI strategies and new research centres emerging.</blockquote><blockquote>There’s very little rigorous thinking the best way to do short-term AI policy from a long-term perspective. My aim is to change that, and in doing so improve the quality of discourse in current AI policy. I would start with a focus on influencing UK AI policy, as I have experience and a strong network here (e.g. the CDEI and Office for AI). Since DeepMind is in the UK, I think it is worth at least some people focusing on UK institutions. I would also ensure this research was broadly relevant, by collaborating with groups working on US AI policy (e.g. FHI, CSET and OpenAI).</blockquote><blockquote>I’m also asking for a time buyout to skill up in ML (~30%). This would improve my own ability to do high-quality research, by helping me to think clearly about how issues might evolve as capabilities advance, and how technical and policy approaches can best combine to influence the future impacts of AI.</blockquote><p>The main work I know of Jess’s is her early involvement in 80,000 Hours. In the first 1-2 years of their existence, she wrote <a href=""https://80000hours.org/author/jess-whittlestone/"">dozens of articles</a> for them, and contributed to their culture and development. Since then I’ve seen her make positive contributions to a number of projects over the years - she has helped in some form with every EA Global conference I’ve organized (two in 2015 and one in 2016), and she’s continued to write publicly in places like the EA Forum, the EA Handbook, and news sites like Quartz and Vox. This background implies that Jess has had a lot of opportunities for members of the fund to judge her output. My sense is that this is the main reason that the other members of the fund were excited about this grant — they generally trust Jess’s judgment and value her experience (while being more hesitant about CFI’s work).</p><p>There are three things I looked into for this grant writeup: Jess’s policy research output, Jess’s blog, and the institutional quality of Leverhulme CFI. The section on Leverhulme CFI became longer than the section on Jess and was mostly unrelated to her work, so I’ve taken it out and included it as an addendum.</p><p><strong>Impressions of Policy Papers</strong></p><p>First is her policy research. The papers I read were from those linked on her blog. They were:</p><ul><li><a href=""http://lcfi.ac.uk/media/uploads/files/AIES-19_paper_188_Whittlestone_Nyrup_Alexandrova_Cave_OcF7jnp.pdf"">The Role and Limits of Principles in AI Ethics: Towards a Focus on Tensions</a> by Jess Whittlestone, Rune Nyrup, Anna Alexandrova and Stephen Cave</li><li><a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.11274.pdf"">Reducing Malicious Use of Synthetic Media Research: Considerations and Potential Release Practices for Machine Learning</a> by Aviv Ovadya and Jess Whittlestone</li></ul><p>On the first paper, about focusing on tensions: the paper said that many “principles of AI ethics” that people publicly talk about in industry, non-profit, government and academia are substantively meaningless, because they don’t come with the sort of concrete advice that actually tells you how to apply them - and specifically, how to trade them off against each other. The part of the paper I found most interesting were four paragraphs pointing to specific tensions between principles of AI ethics. They were:</p><ul><li>Using data to improve the quality and efficiency of services vs. respecting the privacy and autonomy of individuals</li><li>Using algorithms to make decisions and predictions more accurate vs. ensuring fair and equal treatment</li><li>Reaping the benefits of increased personalization in the digital sphere vs. enhancing solidarity and citizenship</li><li>Using automation to make people’s lives more convenient and empowered vs. promoting self-actualization and dignity</li></ul><p>My sense is that while there is some good public discussion about AI and policy (e.g. OpenAI’s work on <a href=""https://openai.com/blog/gpt-2-6-month-follow-up/"">release practices</a> seems quite positive to me), much conversation that brands itself as ‘ethics’ is often not motivated by the desire to ensure this novel technology improves society in accordance with our deepest values, but instead by factors like reputation, PR and politics.</p><p>There are many notions, like <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/01/opinion/peter-thiel-google.html"">Peter Thiel’s</a> “At its core, artificial intelligence is a military technology” or the common question “Who should control the AI?” which don’t fully account for the details of how machine learning and artificial intelligence systems work, or the ways in which we need to think about them in very different ways from other technologies; in particular, that we will need to build new concepts and abstractions to talk about them. I think this is also true of most conversations around making AI fair, inclusive, democratic, safe, beneficial, respectful of privacy, etc.; they seldom consider how these values can be grounded in modern ML systems or future AGI systems. My sense is that much of the best conversation around AI is about how to correctly conceptualize it. This is something that (I was surprised to find) Henry Kissinger’s <a href=""https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/06/henry-kissinger-ai-could-mean-the-end-of-human-history/559124/"">article</a> on AI did well; he spends most of the essay trying to figure out which abstractions to use, as opposed to using already existing ones.</p><p>The reason I liked that bit of Jess’s paper is that I felt the paper used mainstream language around AI ethics (in a way that could appeal to a broad audience), but then:</p><ul><li>Correctly pointed out that AI is a sufficiently novel technology that we’re going to have to rethink what these values actually mean, because the technology causes a host of fundamentally novel ways for them to come into tension</li><li>Provided concrete examples of these tensions</li></ul><p>In the context of a public conversation that I feel is often substantially motivated by politics and PR rather than truth, seeing someone point clearly at important conceptual problems felt like a breath of fresh air.</p><p>That said, given all of the political incentives around public discussion of AI and ethics, I don’t know how papers like this can improve the conversation. For example, companies are worried about losing in the court of Twitter’s public opinion, and also are worried about things like governmental regulation, which are strong forces pushing them to primarily take popular but ineffectual steps to be more ""ethical"". I’m not saying papers like this can’t improve this situation in principle, only that I don’t personally feel like I have much of a clue about how to do it or how to evaluate whether someone else is doing it well, in advance of their having successfully done it.</p><p>Personally, I feel much more able to evaluate the conceptual work of figuring out how to think about AI and its strategic implications (two standout examples are <a href=""https://nickbostrom.com/papers/aipolicy.pdf"">this</a> paper by Bostrom and <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/HBxe6wdjxK239zajf/what-failure-looks-like"">this</a> LessWrong post by Christiano), rather than work on revising popular views about AI. I’d be excited to see Jess continue with the conceptual side of her work, but if she instead primarily aims to influence public conversation (the other goal of that paper), I personally don’t think I’ll be able to evaluate and recommend grants on that basis.</p><p>From the second paper I read sections 3 and 4, which lists many safety and security practices in the fields of biosafety, computer information security, and institutional review boards (IRBs), then outlines variables for analysing release practices in ML. I found it useful, even if it was shallow (i.e. did not go into much depth in the fields it covered). Overall, the paper felt like a fine first step in thinking about this space.</p><p>In both papers, I was concerned with the level of inspiration drawn from bioethics, which seems to me to be a terribly broken field (cf. Scott Alexander talking about his<a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/08/29/my-irb-nightmare/""> IRB nightmare</a> or medicine’s <a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/07/17/who-by-very-slow-decay/"">‘culture of life</a>’). My understanding is that bioethics coordinated a successful power grab (cf. <a href=""https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/history-of-philanthropy/some-case-studies-early-field-growth#Bioethics"">OpenPhil’s writeup</a>) from the field of medicine, creating hundreds of dysfunctional and impractical ethics boards that have formed a highly adversarial relationship with doctors (whose practical involvement with patients often makes them better than ethicists at making tradeoffs between treatment, pain/suffering, and dignity). The formation of an “AI ethics” community that has this sort of adversarial, unhealthy relationship with machine learning researchers would be an incredible catastrophe.</p><p>Overall, it seems like Jess is still at the beginning of her research career (she’s only been in this field for ~1.5 years). And while she’s spent a lot of effort on areas that don’t personally excite me, both of her papers include interesting ideas, and I’m curious to see her future work.</p><p><strong>Impressions of Other Writing</strong></p><p>Jess also writes a blog, and this is one of the main things that makes me excited about this grant. On the topic of AI, she wrote three posts (<a href=""https://jesswhittlestone.com/blog/2019/7/15/how-useful-is-technical-understanding-for-working-in-ai-policy"">1</a>, <a href=""https://jesswhittlestone.com/blog/2019/6/22/thoughts-on-short-vs-long-term-ai-policy"">2</a>, <a href=""https://jesswhittlestone.com/blog/2019/2/19/reflections-on-aiesaaai-19"">3</a>), all of which made good points on at least one important issue. I also thought the post on <a href=""https://jesswhittlestone.com/blog/2018/1/10/reflections-on-confirmation-bias"">confirmation bias and her PhD</a> was quite thoughtful. It correctly identified a lot of problems with discussions of confirmation bias in psychology, and came to a much more nuanced view of the trade-off between being open-minded versus committing to your plans and beliefs. Overall, the posts show independent thinking written with an intent to actually convey understanding to the reader, and doing a good job of it. They share the vibe I associate with much of Julia Galef’s work - they’re noticing true observations / conceptual clarifications, successfully moving the conversation forward one or two steps, and avoiding political conflict.</p><p>I do have some significant concerns with the work above, including the positive portrayal of bioethics and the absence of any criticism toward the AAAI safety conference talks, many of which seem to me to have major flaws.</p><p>While I’m not excited about Leverhulme CFI’s work (see the addendum for details), I think it will be good for Jess to have free rein to follow her own research initiatives within CFI. And while she might be able to obtain funding elsewhere, this alternative seems considerably worse, as I expect other funding options would substantially constrain the types of research she’d be able to conduct.</p><h2>Lynette Bye ($23,000)</h2><blockquote><em><strong>Productivity coaching for effective altruists to increase their impact.</strong></em></blockquote><blockquote><em>I plan to continue coaching high-impact EAs on productivity. I expect to have 600+ sessions with about 100 clients over the next year, focusing on people working in AI safety and EA orgs. I’ve worked with people at FHI, Open Phil, CEA, MIRI, CHAI, DeepMind, the Forethought Foundation, and ACE, and will probably continue to do so. Half of my current clients (and a third of all clients I’ve worked with) are people at these orgs. I aim to increase my clients’ output by improving prioritization and increasing focused work time.</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>I would use the funding to: offer a subsidized rate to people at EA orgs (e.g. between $10 and $50 instead of $125 per call), offer free coaching for select coachees referred by 80,000 Hours, and hire contractors to help me create materials to scale coaching.</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>You can view my impact evaluation (linked below) for how I’m measuring my impact so far.</em></blockquote><p>(Lynette’s public self-evaluation is <a href=""https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/DZ3XxetGk22kQ5seA/impact-report-for-effective-altruism-coaching"">here</a>.)</p><p>I generally think it's pretty hard to do ""productivity coaching"" as your primary activity, especially when you are young, due to a lack of work experience. This means I have a high bar for it being a good idea that someone should go full-time into the ""help other people be more productive” business.</p><p>My sense is that Lynette meets that bar, but only barely (to be clear, I consider it to be a high bar). The main thing that she seems to be doing well is being very organized about everything that she is doing, in a way that makes me confident that her work has had a real impact — if not, I think she’d have noticed and moved on to something else.</p><p>However, as I say in the CFAR writeup, I have a lot of concerns with primarily optimising for legibility, and Lynette’s work shows some signs of this. She has shared around 60 testimonials on her website (linked <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H9zvVQRP1ILPije-Wf1TDYQll7ZwYcR6v4inKteC7XY/edit"">here</a>). Of these, not one of them mentioned anything negative, which clearly indicates that I can't straightforwardly interpret those testimonials as positive evidence (since any unbiased sampling process would have resulted in at least some negative datapoints). I much prefer what another applicant did here: they asked people to send us information anonymously, which increased the chance of our hearing opinions that weren’t selected to create a positive impression. As is, I think I actually shouldn't update much on the testimonials, in particular given that none of them go into much detail on how Lynette has helped them, and almost all of them share a similar structure.</p><p>Reflecting on the broader picture, I think that Lynette’s mindset reflects how I think many of the best operations staff I’ve seen operate: aim to be productive by using simple output metrics, and by doing things in a mindful, structured way (as opposed to, for example, trying to aim for deep transformative insights more traditionally associated with psychotherapy). There is a deep grounded-ness and practical nature to it. I have a lot of respect for that mindset, and I feel as though it's underrepresented in the current EA/rationality landscape. My inside-view models suggest that you can achieve a bunch of good things by helping people become more productive in this way.</p><p>I also think that this mindset comes with a type of pragmatism that I am more concerned about, and often gives rise to what I consider unhealthy adversarial dynamics. As I discussed above, it’s difficult to get information from Lynette’s positive testimonials. My sense is that she might have produced them by directly optimising for “getting a grant” and trying to give me lots of positive information, leading to substantial bias in the selection process. The technique of ‘just optimize for the target’ is valuable in lots of domains, but in this case was quite negative.</p><p>That said, framing her coaching as achieving a series of similar results generally moves me closer to thinking about this grant as ""coaching as a commodity"". Importantly, few people reported very large gains in their productivity; the testimonials instead show a solid stream of small improvements. I think that very few people have access to good coaching, and the high variance in coach quality means that experimenting is often quite expensive and time-consuming. Lynette seems to be able to consistently produce positive effects in the people she is working with, making her services a lot more valuable due to greater certainty around the outcome. (However, I also assign significant probability that the way the evaluation questions were asked reduced the rate at which clients reported either negative <em>or</em> highly positive experiences.)</p><p>I think that many productivity coaches fail to achieve Lynette’s level of reliability, which is one of the key things that makes me hopeful about her work here. My guess is that the value-add of coaching is often straightforwardly positive unless you impose significant costs on your clients, and Lynette seems quite good at avoiding that by primarily optimizing for professionalism and reliability.</p><h1>Further Recommendations (not funded by the LTF Fund)</h1><h2>Center for Applied Rationality ($150,000)</h2><p><em>This grant was recommended by the Fund, but ultimately was funded by a private donor, who (prior to CEA finalizing its standard due diligence checks) had personally offered to make this donation instead. As such, the grant recommendation was withdrawn.</em></p><p><em>Oliver Habryka had created a full writeup by that point, so it is included below.</em></p><blockquote><strong><em>Help promising people to reason more effectively and find high-impact work, such as reducing x-risk.</em></strong></blockquote><blockquote>The Center for Applied Rationality runs workshops that promote particular epistemic norms—broadly, that beliefs should be true, bugs should be solved, and that intuitions/aversions often contain useful data. These workshops are designed to cause potentially impactful people to reason more effectively, and to find people who may be interested in pursuing high-impact careers (especially AI safety).</blockquote><blockquote>Many of the people currently working on AI safety have been through a CFAR workshop, such as 27% of the attendees at the 2019 FLI conference on Beneficial AI in Puerto Rico, and for some of those people it appears that CFAR played a causal role in their decision to switch careers. In the confidential section, we list some graduates from CFAR programs who subsequently decided to work on AI safety, along with our estimates of the counterfactual impact of CFAR on their decision [16 at MIRI, 3 on the OpenAI safety team, 2 at CHAI, and one each at Ought, Open Phil and the DeepMind safety team].</blockquote><blockquote>Recruitment is the most legible form of impact CFAR has, and is probably its most important—the <a href=""https://80000hours.org/2018/10/2018-talent-gaps-survey/#whats-the-key-bottleneck-for-the-effective-altruism-community"">top reported bottleneck</a> in the last two years among EA leaders at Leaders Forum, for example, was finding talented employees.</blockquote><blockquote>[...]</blockquote><blockquote>In 2019, we expect to run or co-run over 100 days of workshops, including our mainline workshop (designed to grow/improve the rationality community), workshops designed specifically to recruit programmers (AIRCS) and mathematicians (MSFP) to AI safety orgs, a 4-weekend instructor training program (to increase our capacity to run workshops), and alumni reunions in both the United States and Europe (to grow the EA/rationality community and cause impactful people to meet/talk with one another). Broadly speaking, we intend to continue doing the sort of work we have been doing so far.</blockquote><p>In our last grant round, I <a href=""https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/CJJDwgyqT4gXktq6g/long-term-future-fund-april-2019-grant-recommendations#CFAR___150_000_"">took an outside view on CFAR</a> and said that, in terms of output, I felt satisfied with CFAR's achievements in recruitment, training and the establishment of communal epistemic norms. I still feel this way about those areas, and my writeup last round still seems like an accurate summary of my reasons for wanting to grant to CFAR. I also said that most of my uncertainty about CFAR lies in its long-term strategic plans, and I continue to feel relatively confused about my thoughts on that.</p><p>I find it difficult to explain my thoughts on CFAR, and I think that a large fraction of this difficulty comes from CFAR being an organization that is <em>intentionally</em> not optimizing towards being easy to understand from the outside, having simple metrics, or more broadly <em>being legible</em>[1]. CFAR is intentionally avoiding being legible to the outside world in many ways. This decision is not obviously wrong, as I think it brings many positives, but I think it is the cause of me feeling particularly confused about how to talk coherently about CFAR.</p><p><strong>Considerations around legibility</strong></p><p><em>Summary: CFAR’s work is varied and difficult to evaluate. This has some good features — it can avoid focusing too closely on metrics that don’t measure impact well — but also forces evaluators to rely on factors that aren’t easy to measure, like the quality of its internal culture. On the whole, while I wish CFAR were somewhat more legible, I appreciate the benefits to CFAR’s work of not maximizing “legibility” at the cost of impact or flexibility.</em></p><p>To help me explain my point, let's contrast CFAR with an organization like AMF, which I think of as exceptionally legible. AMF’s work, compared to many other organizations with tens of millions of dollars on hand, is easy to understand: they buy bednets and give them to poor people in developing countries. As long as AMF continues to carry out this plan, and provides basic data showing its success in bednet distribution, I feel like I can easily model what the organization will do. If I found out that AMF was spending 10% of its money funding religious leaders in developing countries to preach good ethical principles for society, or funding the campaigns of government officials favorable to their work, I would be very surprised and feel like some basic agreement or contract had been violated — regardless of whether I thought those decisions, in the abstract, were good or bad for their mission. AMF claims to distribute anti-malaria bednets, and it is on this basis that I would choose whether to support them.</p><p>AMF could have been a very different organization, and still could be if it wanted to. For example, it could conduct research on various ways to effect change, and give its core staff the freedom to do whatever they thought was best. This new AMF (“AMF 2.0”) might not be able to tell you exactly what they’ll do next year, because they haven’t figured it out yet, but they can tell you that they’ll do whatever their staff determine is best. This could be distributing deworming pills, pursuing speculative medical research, engaging in political activism, funding religious organizations, etc.</p><p>If GiveWell wanted to evaluate AMF 2.0, they would need to use a radically different style of reasoning. There wouldn’t be a straightforward intervention with RCTs to look into. There wouldn’t be a straightforward track record of impact from which to extrapolate. Judging AMF 2.0 would require GiveWell to form much more nuanced judgments about the quality of thinking and execution of AMF’s staff, to evaluate the quality of its internal culture, and to consider a host of other factors that weren’t previously relevant.</p><p>I think that evaluating CFAR requires a lot of that kind of analysis, which seems inherently harder to communicate to other people without summarizing one’s views as: ""I trust the people in that organization to make good decisions.""</p><p>The more general idea here is that organizations are subject to bandwidth constraints - they often want to do lots of different things, but their funders need to be able to understand and predict their behavior with limited resources for evaluation. As <a href=""https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/uHRewtWnWLaSDBuBg/integrity-and-accountability-are-core-parts-of-rationality#comments"">I've written about recently</a>, a key variable for any organization is the people and organizations by which they are trying to be understood and held accountable. For charities that receive most of their funding in small donations from a large population of people who don’t know much about them, this is a very strong constraint; they must communicate their work so that people can understand it very quickly with little background information. If a charity instead receives most of its funding in large donations from a small set of people who follow it closely, it can communicate much more freely, because the funders will be able to spend a lot of their time talking to the org, exchanging models, and generally coming to an understanding of why the org is doing what it’s doing.</p><p>This idea partly explains why most organizations tend to focus on legibility, in how they talk about their work and even in the work they choose to pursue. It can be difficult to attract resources and support from external parties if one’s work isn’t legible.</p><p>I think that CFAR is still likely optimizing too little towards legibility, compared to what I think would be ideal for it. Being legible allows an organization to be more confident that its work is having real effects, because it acquires evidence that holds up to a variety of different viewpoints. However, I think that far too many organizations (nonprofit and otherwise) are trying too hard to make their work legible, in a way that reduces innovation and also introduces a variety of adversarial dynamics. When you make systems that can be gamed, and which carry rewards for success (e.g. job stability, prestige, etc), people will reliably turn up to game them[2].</p><p>(As Jacob has written in his post on <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/PrCmeuBPC4XLDQz8C/unconscious-economies"">Unconscious Economics</a>, this doesn’t mean people are <em>consciously</em> gaming your system, but merely that this <em>behavior</em> will eventually transpire. The many causes of this include selection effects, reinforcement learning, and memetic evolution.)</p><p>In my view, CFAR, by not trying to optimize for a single, easy-to-explain metric, avoids playing the “game” many nonprofits play of focusing on work that will look obviously good to donors, even if it isn’t what the nonprofit believes would be most impactful. They also avoid a variety of other games that come from legibility, such as job applicants getting very good at faking the signals that they are a good fit for an organization, making it harder for them to find good applicants.</p><p>Optimizing for communication with the goal of being given resources introduces adversarial dynamics; someone asking for money may provide limited/biased information that raises the chance they’ll be given a grant but reduces the accuracy of the grantmaker’s understanding. (See my comment in Lynette’s writeup below for an example of how this can arise.) This optimization can also tie down your resources, forcing you to carry out commitments you made for the sake of legibility, rather than doing what you think would be most impactful[3].</p><p>So I think that it's important that we don't force all organizations towards maximal legibility. (That said, we should ensure that organizations are encouraged to pursue at least <em>some</em> degree of legibility, since the <em>lack</em> of legibility also gives rise to various problems.)</p><p><strong>Do I trust CFAR to make good decisions?</strong></p><p>As I mentioned in my initial comments on CFAR, I generally think that the current projects CFAR is working on are quite valuable and worth the resources they are consuming. But I have a lot of trouble modeling CFAR’s long-term planning, and I feel like I have to rely instead on my models of how much I trust CFAR to make good decisions in general, instead of being able to evaluate the merits of their actual plans.</p><p>That said, I do generally trust CFAR's decision-making. It’s hard to explain the evidence that causes me to believe this, but I’ll give a brief overview anyway. (This evidence probably won’t be compelling to others, but I still want to give an accurate summary of where my beliefs come from):</p><ul><li>I expect that a large fraction of CFAR's future strategic plans will continue to be made by Anna Salamon, from whom I have learned a lot of valuable long-term thinking skills, and who seems to me to have made good decisions for CFAR in the past.</li><li>I think CFAR's culture, while imperfect, is still based on strong foundations of good reasoning with deep roots in the philosophy of science and the writings of Eliezer Yudkowsky (which I think serve as a good basis for learning how to think clearly).</li><li>I have made a lot of what I consider my best and most important strategic decisions in the context of, and aided by, events organized by CFAR. This suggests to me that at least some of that generalizes to CFAR's internal ability to think strategically.</li><li>I am excited about a number of individuals who intend to complete CFAR's latest round of instructor training, which gives me some optimism about CFAR's future access to good talent and its ability to establish and sustain a good internal culture.</li></ul><p><strong>Footnotes</strong></p><p>[1] The focus on ‘legibility’ in this context I take from James C. Scott’s book “Seeing Like a State.” It was introduced to me by Elizabeth Van Nostrand in <a href=""https://acesounderglass.com/2016/12/01/5167/"">this blogpost</a> discussing it in the context of GiveWell and good giving; Scott Alexander also discussed it <a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/16/book-review-seeing-like-a-state/"">in his review of the book</a> . Here’s an example from Scott regarding centralized planning and governance:</p><blockquote><em>the centralized state wanted the world to be “legible”, ie arranged in a way that made it easy to monitor and control. An intact forest might be more productive than an evenly-spaced rectangular grid of Norway spruce, but it was harder to legislate rules for, or assess taxes on.</em></blockquote><p>[2] The errors that follow are all forms of <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/EbFABnst8LsidYs5Y/goodhart-taxonomy"">Goodhart’s Law</a>, which states that “any observed statistical regularity will tend to collapse once pressure is placed upon it for control purposes.”</p><p>[3] The benefits of (and forces that encourage) stability and reliability can maybe be most transparently understood in the context of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menu_cost"">menu costs</a> and the prevalence of <a href=""https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sticky-wage-theory.asp"">highly sticky wages</a>.</p><h1>Addenda</h1><h2>Addendum: Thoughts on a Strategy Article by the Leadership of Leverhulme CFI and CSER</h2><p><em>I wrote the following in the course of thinking about the grant to Jess Whittlestone.

I reread and reviewed an article published in Nature earlier this year called <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-018-0003-2.pdf"">Bridging near- and long-term concerns about AI</a>, written by the Executive Directors at Leverhulme CFI and CSER respectively, Stephen Cave and Seán ÓhÉigeartaigh.</p><p><strong>Summary and aims of the article</strong></p><p>The article’s summary:</p><blockquote><em>Debate about the impacts of AI is often split into two camps, one associated with the near term and the other with the long term. This divide is a mistake — the connections between the two perspectives deserve more attention, say Stephen Cave and Seán S. ÓhÉigeartaigh.</em></blockquote><p>This is not a position I hold, and I’m going to engage with the content below in more detail.</p><p>Overall, I found the claims of the essay hard to parse and often ambiguous, but I’ve attempted to summarize what I view as its three main points:</p><ol type=""1""><li>If ML is a primary technology used in AGI, then there are likely some design decisions today that will create lock-in in the long-term and have increasingly important implications for AGI safety.</li><li>If we can predict changes in society from ML that matter in the long-term (such as automation of jobs), then we can prepare policy for them in the short term (like preparing educational retraining for lorry drivers who will be automated).</li><li>Norms and institutions built today will have long-term effects, and so people who care about the long term should especially care about near-term norms and institutions.</li></ol><p>They say “<em>These three points relate to ways in which addressing near-term issues could contribute to solving potential long-term problems.</em>”</p><p>If I ask myself what Leverhulme/CSER’s goals are for this document, it feels to me like it is intended as a statement of diplomacy. It’s saying that near-term and long-term AI risk work are split into two camps, but that we should be looking for common ground (“t<em>he connections between the two perspectives deserve more attention</em>”, “<em>Learning from the long term</em>”). It tries to emphasize shared values (“<em>Connected research priorities</em>”) and the importance of cooperation amongst many entities (“<em>The challenges we will face are likely to require deep interdisciplinary and intersectoral collaboration between industries, academia and policymakers, alongside new international agreements</em>”). The goal that I think it is trying to achieve is to negotiate trade and peace between the near-term and long-term camps by arguing that “<em>This divide is a mistake</em>”.</p><p><strong>Drawing the definitions does a lot of work</strong></p><p>The authors define “long-term concerns” with the following three examples:</p><blockquote>wide-scale loss of jobs, risks of AI developing broad superhuman capabilities that could put it beyond our control, and fundamental questions about humanity’s place in a world with intelligent machines</blockquote><p>Despite this broad definition, they only use concrete examples from the first category, which I would classify as something like “mid-term issues.” I think the possibility of even wide-scale loss of jobs, unless interpreted extremely broadly, is something that does not make sense to put into the same category as the other two, which are primarily concerned with stakes that are orders of magnitude higher (such as the future of the human species). I think this conflation of very different concerns causes the rest of the article to make an argument that is more likely to mislead than to inform.</p><p>After this definition, the article failed to mention any issue that I would classify as representative of the long-term concerns of Nick Bostrom or Max Tegmark, both of whom are cited by the article to define “long-term issues.” (In Tegmark’s book Life 3.0, he explicitly categorizes unemployment as a short-term concern, to be distinguished from long-term concerns.)</p><p><strong>Conceptual confusions in short- and mid-term policy suggestions</strong></p><p>The article has the following policy idea:</p><blockquote><em>Take explainability (the extent to which the decisions of autonomous systems can be understood by relevant humans): if regulatory measures make this a requirement, more funding will go to developing transparent systems, while techniques that are powerful but opaque may be deprioritized.</em></blockquote><p>(Let me be clear that this is <strong>not explicitly listed as a policy recommendation</strong>.)</p><p>My naive prior is that there is no good AI regulation a government could establish today. I continue to feel this way after looking into this case (and the next example below). Let me explain why in this case the idea that regulation requiring explainability would encourage transparent + explainable systems is false.</p><p>Modern ML systems are not doing a type of reasoning that is amenable to explanation in the way human decisions often are. There is not a principled explanation of their reasoning when deciding whether to offer you a bank loan, there is merely a mass of correlations between spending history and later reliability, which may factorise into a small number of well-defined chunks like “how regularly someone pays their rent” but it might not. The main problem with the quoted paragraph is that it does not at all attempt to specify how to define explainability in an ML system to the point where it can be regulated, meaning that any regulation would either be meaningless and ignored, or worse highly damaging. Policies formed in this manner will either be of no consequence, or deeply antagonise the ML community. We currently don’t know how to think about explainability of ML systems, and ignoring that problem and regulating that they should be ‘explainable’ will not work.</p><p>The article also contains the following policy idea about autonomous weapons.</p><blockquote><em>The decisions we make now, for example, on international regulation of autonomous weapons, could have an outsized impact on how this field develops. A firm precedent that only a human can make a ‘kill’ decision could significantly shape how AI is used — for example, putting the focus on enhancing instead of replacing human capacities.</em></blockquote><p>Here and throughout the article, repeated uses of the conditional ‘could’ make it unclear to me whether this is being endorsed or merely suggested. I can’t quite tell if they think that drone swarms are a long-term issue - they contrast it with a short-term issue but don’t explicitly say that it is long-term. Nonetheless, I think their suggesting it here is also a bit misguided.</p><p>Let me contrast this with Nick Bostrom on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5c4cv7rVlE8"">a recent episode of the Joe Rogan Experience</a>explaining that he thinks that the specific rule has ambiguous value. Here’s a quote from a discussion of the campaign to ban lethal autonomous weapons:</p><blockquote><strong>Nick Bostrom: I</strong>’ve kind of stood a little bit on the sidelines on that particular campaign, being a little unsure exactly what it is that… certainly I think it’d be better if we refrained from having some arms race to develop these than not. But if you start to look in more detail: What precisely is the thing that you’re hoping to ban? So if the idea is the autonomous bit, that the robot should not be able to make its own firing decision, well, if the alternative to that is there is some 19-year old guy sitting in some office building and his job is whenever the screen flashes ‘fire now’ he has to press a red button. And exactly the same thing happens. I’m not sure how much is gained by having that extra step.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Interviewer:</strong> But it feels better for us for some reason. If someone is pushing the button.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Nick Bostrom:</strong> But what exactly does that mean. In every particular firing decision? Well, you gotta attack this group of surface ships here, and here are the general parameters, and you’re not allowed to fire outside these coordinates? I don’t know. Another is the question of: it would be better if we had no wars, but if there is gonna be a war, maybe it is better if it’s robots v robots. Or if there’s gonna be bombing, maybe you want the bombs to have high precision rather than low precision - get fewer civilian casualties.</blockquote><blockquote>[...]</blockquote><blockquote>On the other hand you could imagine it reduces the threshold for going to war, if you think that you wouldn’t fear any casualties you would be more eager to do it. Or if it proliferates and you have these mosquito-sized killer-bots that terrorists have. It doesn’t seem like a good thing to have a society where you have a facial-recognition thing, and then the bot flies out and you just have a kind of dystopia.</blockquote><p>Overall, it seems that in both situations, the key open questions are in understanding the systems and how they’ll interface with areas of industry, government and personal life, and that regulation based on inaccurate conceptualizations of the technology would either be meaningless or harmful.</p><p><strong>Polarizing approach to policy coordination</strong></p><p>I have two main concerns with what I see as the intent of the paper.</p><p>The first one can be summarized by Robin Hanson’s article <a href=""http://www.overcomingbias.com/2019/03/tug-sideways.html"">To Oppose Polarization, Tug Sideways</a>:</p><blockquote>The policy world can [be] thought of as consisting of a few Tug-O-War ""ropes"" set up in this high dimensional policy space. If you want to find a comfortable place in this world, where the people around you are reassured that you are ""one of them,"" you need to continually and clearly telegraph your loyalty by treating each policy issue as another opportunity to find more supporting arguments for your side of the key dimensions. That is, pick a rope and pull on it.</blockquote><blockquote>If, however, you actually want to improve policy, if you have a secure enough position to say what you like, and if you can find a relevant audience, then [you should] prefer to pull policy ropes sideways. Few will bother to resist such pulls, and since few will have considered such moves, you have a much better chance of identifying a move that improves policy. On the few main dimensions, not only will you find it very hard to move the rope much, but you should have little confidence that you actually have superior information about which way the rope should be pulled.</blockquote><p>I feel like the article above is not pulling policy ropes sideways, but is instead connecting long-term issues to specific sides of existing policy debates, around which there is already a lot of tension. The issue of technological unemployment seems to me to be a highly polarizing topic, where taking a position seems ill-advised, and I have very low confidence about the correct direction in which to pull policy. Entangling long-term issues with these highly tense short-term issues seems like it will likely reduce our future ability to broadly coordinate on these issues (by having them associated with highly polarized existing debates).</p><p><strong>Distinction between long- and short-term thinking</strong></p><p>My second concern is that on a deeper level, I think that the type of thinking that generates a lot of the arguments around concerns for long-term technological risks is very different from that which suggests policies around technological unemployment and racial bias. I think there is some value in having these separate ways of thinking engage in “conversation,” but I think the linked paper is confusing in that it seems to try to down-play the differences between them. An analogy might be the differences between physics and architecture; both fields nominally work with many similar objects, but the distinction between the two is very important, and the fields clearly require different types of thinking and problem-solving.</p><p>Some of my concerns are summarized by Eliezer in his writing on <a href=""https://arbital.com/p/pivotal/"">Pivotal Acts</a>:</p><blockquote>...compared to the much more difficult problems involved with making something actually smarter than you be safe, it may be tempting to try to write papers that you know you can finish, like a paper on robotic cars <a href=""https://arbital.com/p/EliezerYudkowsky.RobotsAIUnemploymentAntiFAQ/"">causing unemployment</a> in the trucking industry, or a paper on who holds legal liability when a factory machine crushes a worker. But while it's true that crushed factory workers and unemployed truckers are both, ceteris paribus, bad, they are not astronomical catastrophes that transform all galaxies inside our future light cone into paperclips, and the latter category seems worth distinguishing...</blockquote><blockquote>...there will [...] be a temptation for the grantseeker to argue, ""Well, if AI causes unemployment, that could slow world economic growth, which will make countries more hostile to each other, which would make it harder to prevent an AI arms race."" But the possibility of something ending up having a non-zero impact on astronomical stakes is not the same concept as events that have a game-changing impact on astronomical stakes. The question is what are the largest lowest-hanging fruit in astronomical stakes, not whether something can be argued as defensible by pointing to a non-zero astronomical impact.</blockquote><p>I currently don’t think that someone who is trying to understand how to deal with technological long-term risk should spend much time thinking about technological unemployment or related issues, but it feels like the paper is trying to advocate for the opposite position.</p><p><strong>Concluding thoughts on the article</strong></p><p>Many people in the AI policy space have to spend a lot of effort to gain respect and influence, and it’s genuinely hard to figure out a way to do this while acting with integrity. One common difficulty in this area is navigating the incentives to connect one’s arguments to issues that already get a lot of attention (e.g. ongoing political debates). My read is that this essay makes these connections even when they aren’t justified; it implies that many short- and medium-term concerns are a natural extension of current long-term thought, while failing to accurately portray what I consider to be the core arguments around long-term risks and benefits from AI. It seems like the effect of this essay will be to reduce perceived differences between long-term, mid-term and short-term work on risks from AI, to cause confusion about the actual concerns of Bostrom et al., and to make future communications work in this space harder and more polarized.</p><p><strong>Broader thoughts on CSER and CFI</strong></p><p>I only had the time and space to critique one specific article from CFI and CSER. However, from talking to others working in the global catastrophic risk space, and from engagement with significant fractions of the rest of CSER and CFI’s work, I've come to think that the problems I see in this article are mostly representative of the problems I see in CSER’s and CFI’s broader strategy and work. I don’t think what I’ve written sufficiently justifies that claim; however, it seems useful to share this broader assessment to allow others to make better predictions about my future grant recommendations, and maybe also to open a dialogue that might cause me to change my mind.</p><p>Overall, based on the concerns I’ve expressed in this essay, and that I’ve had with other parts of CFI and CSER’s work, I worry that their efforts to shape the conversation around AI policy, and to mend disputes between those focused on long-term and short-term problems, do not address important underlying issues and may have net-negative consequences.</p><p>That said, it’s good that these organizations give some researchers a way to get PhDs/postdocs at Cambridge with relatively little institutional oversight and an opportunity to explore a large variety of different topics (e.g. Jess, and Shahar Avin, a previous grantee whose work I’m excited about).</p><h2>Addendum: Thoughts on incentives in technical fields in academia</h2><p><em>I wrote the following in the course of writing about the AI Safety Camp. This is a model I use commonly when thinking about funding for AI alignment work, but it ended up not being very relevant to that writeup, so I’m leaving it here as a note of interest.</em></p><p>My understanding of many parts of technical academia is that there is a strong incentive to make your writing hard to understand while appearing more impressive by using a lot of math. Eliezer Yudkowsky <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xQ9tMMk3RArodLtDq/intellectual-progress-inside-and-outside-academia"">describes</a> his understanding of it as such (and expands on this further in <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Gg9a4y8reWKtLe3Tn/the-rocket-alignment-problem#comments"">the rocket alignment problem</a>):</p><blockquote><em>The point of current AI safety work is to cross, e.g., the gap between [. . . ] saying “Ha ha, I want AIs to have an off switch, but it might be dangerous to be the one holding the off switch!” to, e.g., realizing that utility indifference is an open problem. After this, we cross the gap to solving utility indifference in unbounded form. Much later, we cross the gap to a form of utility indifference that actually works in practice with whatever machine learning techniques are used, come the day.</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>Progress in modern AI safety mainly looks like progress in conceptual clarity — getting past the stage of “Ha ha it might be dangerous to be holding the off switch.” Even though Stuart Armstrong’s original proposal for utility indifference completely failed to work (as observed at MIRI by myself and Benya), it was still a lot of conceptual progress compared to the “Ha ha that might be dangerous” stage of thinking.</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>Simple ideas like these would be where I expect the battle for the hearts of future grad students to take place; somebody with exposure to Armstrong’s first simple idea knows better than to walk directly into the whirling razor blades without having solved the corresponding problem of fixing Armstrong’s solution. A lot of the actual increment of benefit to the world comes from getting more minds past the “walk directly into the whirling razor blades” stage of thinking, which is not complex-math-dependent.</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>Later, there’s a need to have real deployable solutions, which may or may not look like impressive math per se. But actual increments of safety there may be a long time coming. [. . . ]</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>Any problem whose current MIRI-solution looks hard (the kind of proof produced by people competing in an inexploitable market to look impressive, who gravitate to problems where they can produce proofs that look like costly signals of intelligence) is a place where we’re flailing around and grasping at complicated results in order to marginally improve our understanding of a confusing subject matter. Techniques you can actually adapt in a safe AI, come the day, will probably have very simple cores — the sort of core concept that takes up three paragraphs, where any reviewer who didn’t spend five years struggling on the problem themselves will think, “Oh I could have thought of that.” Someday there may be a book full of clever and difficult things to say about the simple core — contrast the simplicity of the core concept of causal models, versus the complexity of proving all the clever things Judea Pearl had to say about causal models. But the planetary benefit is mainly from posing understandable problems crisply enough so that people can see they are open, and then from the simpler abstract properties of a found solution — complicated aspects will not carry over to real AIs later.</em></blockquote><p>And gives a concrete example <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xQ9tMMk3RArodLtDq/intellectual-progress-inside-and-outside-academia"">here</a>:</p><blockquote><em>The</em> <em><a href=""http://auai.org/uai2016/proceedings/papers/68.pdf"">journal paper that Stuart Armstrong coauthored</a></em> <em>on ""interruptibility"" is a far step down from Armstrong's other work on corrigibility. It had to be dumbed way down (I'm counting obscuration with fancy equations and math results as ""dumbing down"") to be published in a mainstream journal. It had to be stripped of all the caveats and any mention of explicit incompleteness, which is necessary meta-information for any ongoing incremental progress, not to mention important from a safety standpoint. The root cause can be debated but the observable seems plain. If you want to get real work done, the obvious strategy would be to not subject yourself to any academic incentives or bureaucratic processes. Particularly including peer review by non-""hobbyists"" (peer commentary by fellow ""hobbyists"" still being potentially very valuable), or review by grant committees staffed by the sort of people who are still impressed by academic sage-costuming and will want you to compete against pointlessly obscured but terribly serious-looking equations.</em></blockquote><p>(<a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/2QiuMcgQx3fes3zfB/ai-indifference-through-utility-manipulation"">Here</a> is a public example of Stuart’s work on utility indifference, though I had difficulty finding the most relevant examples of his work on this subject.)</p><p>Some examples that seem to me to use an appropriate level of formalism include: the <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/Rm6oQRJJmhGCcLvxh"">Embedded Agency sequence</a>, the <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/r9tYkB2a8Fp4DN8yB"">Mesa-Optimisation paper</a>, some posts by DeepMind researchers (<a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/BKjJJH2cRpJcAnP7T/thoughts-on-human-models"">thoughts on human models</a>, <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yXPT4nr4as7JvxLQa/classifying-specification-problems-as-variants-of-goodhart-s"">classifying specification problems as variants of Goodhart’s law</a>), and many other blog posts by these authors and others on the AI Alignment Forum.</p><p>There’s a sense in which it’s fine to play around with the few formalisms you have a grasp of when you’re getting to grips with ideas in this field. For example, MIRI recently held a retreat for new researchers, which led to a number of blog posts that followed this pattern (<a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/22gPT6L5XEvHqW7bi/thoughts-on-retrieving-knowledge-from-neural-networks"">1</a>, <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/qdqYrcGZTh9Lp49Nj/creating-environments-to-design-and-test-embedded-agents"">2</a>, <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/Pxvq2RMAKCuY6SHm9/logical-counterfactuals-and-proposition-graphs-part-1"">3</a>, <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/3eKqeq8kzEmEsoFiy/torture-and-dust-specks-and-joy-oh-my-or-non-archimedean"">4</a>). But aiming for lots of technical formalism is not helpful - any conception of useful work that focuses primarily on molding the idea to the format rather than molding the format to the idea, especially for (nominally) impressive technical formats, is likely optimizing for the wrong metric and falling prey to Goodhart’s law.</p>",habryka4,habryka4,habryka,

Instead of waiting for the next year, let&apos;s do it right now.</p><p>My proposed setup:</p><p>1. Take the original 125 LW users. Take a prize pool of $1,250 (or more if people are willing to donate). The prize pool is split evenly between each player, but you have to survive the game to get paid. Everyone is anonymized in the game.</p><p>2. The game will last a minimum of 4 days (to give everyone enough time to act, strategize, and think). After 4 days, there will be an increasing probability that the game will end at any minute. (This is to prevent anyone trying to attack right when the game ends to avoid retaliation. In expectation, the game should last about a week.)</p><p>3. Each player will have the number of missiles equal to the number of players. They can launch any number of them.</p><p>4. When a missile is launched: a) the attacked player is notified that they are being attacked by a specific player (and therefore has an option to retaliate), b) 48 hours after the launch, the attacked player is declared dead: they can no longer perform any actions and will not receive a payout, c) 48 hours after the launch, the attacking player gets the target player&apos;s entire prize pool.</p><p>5. During the game there will be at least 125 fake alerts. They will be generated randomly (so some players might receive zero or more than one fake alerts). It will look the same as if some specific player has launched a missile against you. 48 hours after the notification, you&apos;ll find out whether it was real or not by whether or not you&apos;re still alive.</p><p>Additional details:</p><ul><li>You can see who has been killed.</li><li>You can only know about missiles launches that you have done or that have been done to target you.</li><li>If you take money from a player who already took money from someone else, you get those too. So in theory, we could end up with one winner with the entire original prize pool.</li><li>When people create their accounts, they&apos;ll have an optional to either receive their winnings directly (let&apos;s say via PayPal) or to donate to LW. (Personally, I hope most people will choose the second option, which will make the payout much less of a hustle.)</li><li>I&apos;m not sure how to <em>easily</em> structure this so that the players are <em>completely</em> anonymous. (For example, if I&apos;m sending the payouts, I&apos;ll know.) If this seems like an important feature, I&apos;m willing to work through this. (E.g. each player gets a random invite code and creates a new account. There&apos;s no record of who received what invite code. Payouts are done to anonymous BTC addresses.)</li></ul><p>What do you think?</p><ul><li>Does it look like the rules are facilitating the kind of experiment we want to run?</li><li>If you were part of the originally selected group, are you willing to participate?</li><li>Can anyone add to the prize pool?</li><li>Any clever way to structure this game on top of some existing platform to avoid writing too much code?</li></ul>",Alexei,alexei,Alexei,

It&apos;s a learning technique that allows you to remember almost anything as long as you want. It works by repeatedly answering test questions with increasing intervals. The problem is it&apos;s not widely used (just like the art of rationality). Existing solutions are either limited to memorization of terms/foreign language words or require you to create all flashcards (test questions) yourself. But those who go through the struggle of creating flashcards for complex topics themselves show that spaced repetition can help in learning any topic.</p><p>The main hurdle to sharing flashcards is that you can&apos;t understand the question written by someone else if you don&apos;t know the topic quite well already. Therefore you have to start repetition when you understand the underlying concept. It seems that the best timing is right after you read about the relevant concept in a textbook or watch a lecture. The test question has to be integrated with the educational content.</p><p>The linked article describes the approach we take to implement this idea. We&apos;ve already made a basic implementation. Now we&apos;re looking for those who want to try use it in their personal learning. But even more importantly those who are willing to experiment with creating courses for others.

Put them in the modern environment, and they'll behave as if they  like tasty food and good feelings. Pump heroin into their brains, and they'll behave as if they want high dopamine levels.</p><p>None of these are the One True Values of the humans, they're just what humans seem to value in context, at different levels of abstraction. And this is all there is - there is no One True Context in which we find One True Values, there are just regular contexts. Thus we're in a bit of a pickle when it comes to teaching an AI how we want the world to be rearranged, because there's no One True Best State Of The World.</p><p>This underdetermination gets even worse when we consider that there's no One True Generalization Procedure, either. At least for everyday sorts of questions (do I want nutrition, or do I want tasty food?), we're doing <em>interpolation</em>, not extrapolation. But when we ask about contexts or options totally outside the training set (how should we arrange the atoms of the Milky Way?), we're back to the problem illustrated with train tracks in <a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/09/25/the-tails-coming-apart-as-metaphor-for-life/"">The Tails Coming Apart As Metaphor For Life</a>.</p><p>Sometimes it feels like for every value alignment proposal, the arbitrariness of certain decisions sticks out like a missing finger on a hand. And we just have to hope that it all works out fine and that this arbitrary decision turns out to be a good one, because there's no way to make a <em>non</em>-arbitrary decision for some choices.</p><p>Is it possible for us to make peace with this upsetting fact of moral indeterminacy? If two slightly different methods of value learning give two very different plans for the galaxy, should we regard both plans as equally good, and be fine with either? I don't think this acceptance of arbitrariness is crazy, and some amount is absolutely necessary. But this pill might be less bitter to swallow if we clarify our picture of what ""value learning"" is supposed to be doing in the first place.</p><p><strong>AIs aren't driving towards their One Best State anyhow:</strong></p><p>For example, what kind of ""human values"" object do we want a value learning scheme to learn? Because it ain't a utility function over microphysical states of the world.</p><p>After all, we don't want a FAI to be in the business of finding the best position for all the atoms, and then moving the atoms there and freezing them. We want the ""best state"" to contain people growing, exploring, changing the environment, and so on. This is only a ""state"" at all when viewed at some very high level of abstraction that incorporates history and time evolution.</p><p>So when two Friendly AIs generalize differently, this might look less like totally different end-states for the galaxy, but like subtly different opinions on which dynamics make for a satisfying galactic society... which eventually lead to totally different end-states for the galaxy. Look, I never said this would make the problem go away - we're still talking about generalizing from our training set to the entire universe, here. If I'm making any comforting point here, it's that the arbitrariness doesn't have to be tense or alien or too big to comprehend, it can be between reasonable things that all sound like good ideas.</p><p><strong>Meta-ethics:</strong></p><p>And jumping Jehoshaphat, we haven't even talked about meta-ethics yet. AI that takes meta-ethics into account wouldn't only learn what we appear to value according to whatever definition it started with, it would try to take into account what we think it means to value things, what it means to make good decisions, what we think we value, and what we want to value.</p><p>This can get a lot trickier than just inferring a utility function from a human's actions, and we don't have a very good understanding of it right now. But our concern about the arbitrariness of values is precisely a meta-ethical concern, so you can see why it might be a big deal to build an AI that cares about meta-ethics. I'd want a superhuman meta-ethical reasoner to learn that there was something weird and scary about this problem of formalizing and generalizing values, and take superhumanly reasonable steps to address this. The only problem is I have no idea how to build such a thing.</p><p>But in lieu of superintelligent solutions, we can still try to research appealing metaethical schemes for controlling generalization.</p><p>One such scheme is incrementalism. Rather than immediately striking out for the optimal utopia your model predicts, maybe it's safer to follow something like an iterative process - humans learning, thinking, growing, changing the world, and eventually ending up at a utopia that might not be what you had in mind at the start. (More technically, we might simulate this process as flow between environments, where we start with our current environment and values, and flow to nearby environments based on our rating of them, at each step updating our values not according to what they would actually be in that environment, but based on an idealized meta-ethical update rule set by our current selves.)</p><p> This was inspired by <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/pcomQ4Fwi7FnfBZBR/how-does-gradient-descent-interact-with-goodhart"">Scott Garrabrant's question about gradient descent vs. Goodhart's law</a>. If we think of utopias as optimized points in a landscape of possibilities, we might want to find ones that lie near to home - via hill-climbing or other local dynamics - rather than trusting our model to safely teleport us to some far-off point in configuration space.</p><p>It also bears resemblance to <a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Coherent_Extrapolated_Volition"">Eliezer_2004's meta-ethical wish list</a>: ""if we knew more, [...] were the people we wished we were, had grown up farther together..."" There just seems to be something meta-ethically trustworthy about ""growing up more.""</p><p>This also illustrates how the project of incorporating meta-ethics into value learning really has its work cut out for it. Of course there are arbitrary choices in meta-ethics too, but somehow they seem more palatable than arbitrary choices at the lower meta-level. Whether we do it with artificial help or not, I think it's possible to gradually tease out what sort of things we want from value learning, which might not reduce the number of arbitrary choices, but hopefully can reduce their danger and mystery.</p>",Charlie Steiner,charlie-steiner,Charlie Steiner,

Instead of hosting comments on jefftk.com directly, I copy
over publicly-accessible comments from discussion elsewhere:

By default it's first-name only when copying from social media
(Facebook, Google Plus) and full name when copying from forums
(LessWrong, EA Forum), though I have it always use my full name for
clarity. While everything I copy over is already world-readable
without an account, some people don't want their comments copied (let
me know if that includes you!), in which case I show something like:

It's a little fragile, though, and about a year after I last <a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/reworking-facebook-comment-inclusion"">fixed</a> Facebook
comment inclusion it broke again.  And Google Plus was turned off, so
I couldn't pull comments from there either.  And the EA Forum and
LessWrong migrated to new software that didn't support the old (and
not very good) rss-based system.  And my adapters for Hacker News and
Reddit broke too.

I've now gotten the main four working again, though it's not quite the
same as before:

the GraphQL API and pull comments as needed, so crossposting is very
fast.</p></li>
<li><p>I have <a href=""https://github.com/jeffkaufman/comments-selenium"">new code</a>
for Facebook that runs selenium while logged out to build an archive,
and I'll figure out some system for updating it at some point.
Crossposting is very slow, like ~weeks.</p></li>

<p>

At some point I may get Reddit and HN fixed, but I don't crosspost to
them very often so it's not much of a priority.

I don't think this is causing any deep confusions among researchers here, but I'd still like to take a stab at disambiguating some of this, if nothing else for my own sake. Here are some distinct (albeit related) ways that utility functions can come up in AI safety, in terms of what assumptions/hypotheses they give rise to:</p><p><em><u>AGI utility hypothesis</u>: The first AGI will behave as if it is maximizing some utility function</em></p><p><em><u>ASI utility hypothesis</u>: As AI capabilities improve well beyond human-level, it will behave more and more as if it is maximizing some utility function (or will have already reached that ideal earlier and stayed there)</em></p><p><em><u>Human utility hypothesis</u>: Even though in some experimental contexts humans seem to not even be particularly goal-directed, utility functions are often a useful model of human preferences to use in AI safety research</em></p><p><u><em><a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Coherent_Extrapolated_Volition"">Coherent Extrapolated Volition</a></em> </u><em><u>(CEV) hypothesis</u>: For a given human H, there exists some utility function V such that if H is given the appropriate time/resources for reflection, H's values would converge to V</em></p><p>Some points to be made:</p><ul><li>The ""Goals vs Utility Functions"" chapter of Rohin's <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/4dHMdK5TLN6xcqtyc"">Value Learning sequence</a>, and the resulting discussion focused on differing intuitions about the AGI and ASI utility hypotheses. Specifically, the <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/NxF5G6CJiof6cemTw/coherence-arguments-do-not-imply-goal-directed-behavior"">main post</a> there pointed out that seemingly anything can be trivially modeled as being a ""utility maximizer"" (further discussion <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/yGuo5R9fgrrFLYWuv/when-do-utility-functions-constrain-1"">here</a>), whereas only some intelligent agents can be described as being ""goal-directed"" (as defined in <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/4dHMdK5TLN6xcqtyc/p/DfcywmqRSkBaCB6Ma"">this post</a>), and the latter is a more useful concept for reasoning about AI safety.</li><li>AGI utility doesn't logically imply ASI utility, but I'd be surprised if anyone thinks it's very plausible for the former to be true while the latter fails. In particular, the <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/RQpNHSiWaXTvDxt6R/coherent-decisions-imply-consistent-utilities"">coherence arguments</a> and <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/4dHMdK5TLN6xcqtyc/p/9zpT9dikrrebdq3Jf"">other pressures</a> that move agents toward VNM seem to roughly scale with capabilities. A plausible stance could be that we should expect most ASIs to hew close to the VNM ideal, but these pressures aren't quite so overwhelming at the AGI level; in particular, humans are fairly goal-directed but only ""partially"" VNM, so the goal-directedness pressures on an AGI will likely be at this order of magnitude. Depending on takeoff speeds, we might get many years to try aligning AGIs at this level of goal-directedness, which seems less dangerous than playing sorcerer's apprentice with VNM-based AGIs at the same level of capability.(Note: I might be reifying VNM here too much, in thinking of things having a measure of ""goal-directedness"" with ""very goal-directed"" approximating VNM. But this basic picture could be wrong in all sorts of ways.)</li><li>The human utility hypothesis is much more vague than the others, and seems ultimately context-dependent. To my knowledge, the main argument in its favor is the fact that most of economics is founded on it. On the other hand, behavioral economists have formulated models like prospect theory for when greater precision is required than the simplistic VNM model gives, not to mention the cases where it breaks down more drastically. I haven't seen prospect theory used in AI safety research; I'm not sure if this reflects more a) the size of the field and the fact that few researchers have had much need to explicitly model human preferences, or b) that we don't need to model humans more than superficially. since this kind of research is still at a very early theoretical stage with all sorts of real-world error terms abounding.</li><li>The CEV hypothesis can be strengthened, consistent with Yudkowsky's original vision, to say that every human will converge to about the same values. But the extra ""values converge"" assumption seems orthogonal to one's opinions about the relevance of utility functions, so I'm not including it in the above list.</li><li>In practice a given researcher's opinions on these tend to be correlated, so it makes sense to talk of ""pro-utility"" and ""anti-utility"" viewpoints. But I'd guess the correlation is far from perfect, and at any rate, the arguments connecting these hypotheses seem somewhat tenuous.</li></ul>",Grue_Slinky,grue_slinky,Grue_Slinky,

<p>As I discussed at <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/FoJSa8mgLPT83g9e8/jeff-hawkins-on-neuromorphic-agi-within-20-years"">Jeff Hawkins on neuromorphic AGI within 20 years</a>, and was earlier discussed on LessWrong at <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9Yc7Pp7szcjPgPsjf/the-brain-as-a-universal-learning-machine"">The brain as a universal learning machine</a>, there is a theory, due originally to Vernon Mountcastle in the 1970s, that the neocortex<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-krmw4TusQ7emK3bsJ-1"" id=""fnref-krmw4TusQ7emK3bsJ-1"">[1]</a></sup> (75% of the human brain by weight) consists of ~150,000 interconnected copies of a little module, the ""cortical column"", <em>each of which implements the same algorithm</em>. Following Jeff Hawkins, I'll call this the ""common cortical algorithm"" (CCA) theory. (I don't think that terminology is standard.)</p>
<p>So instead of saying that the human brain has a vision processing algorithm, motor control algorithm, language algorithm, planning algorithm, and so on, in CCA theory we say that (to a first approximation) we have a massive amount of ""general-purpose neocortical tissue"", and if you dump visual information into that tissue, it does visual processing, and if you connect that tissue to motor control pathways, it does motor control, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Whether and to what extent CCA theory is true is, I think, very important for AGI forecasting, strategy, and both technical and non-technical safety research directions</strong>—<a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/vjrHrAhDjtYWGdaTJ/if-the-one-cortical-algorithm-hypothesis-is-true-how-should#Pi9bkDjP4g2BuXzc4"">see my answer here</a> for more details.</p>
<h2>Should we believe CCA theory?</h2>
<p>CCA theory, as I'm using the term, is a simplified model. There are almost definitely a couple caveats to it:</p>
<ol>
<li>There are sorta ""hyperparameters"" on the generic learning algorithm which seem to be set differently in different parts of the neocortex. For example, some areas of the cortex have higher or lower density of particular neuron types. There are other examples too.<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-krmw4TusQ7emK3bsJ-2"" id=""fnref-krmw4TusQ7emK3bsJ-2"">[2]</a></sup> I don't think this significantly undermines the usefulness or correctness of CCA theory, as long as these changes <em>really are</em> akin to hyperparameters, as opposed to specifying fundamentally different algorithms. So my reading of the evidence is that if you put, say, motor nerves coming out of visual cortex tissue, the tissue could do motor control, but it wouldn't do it quite as well as the motor cortex does.<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-krmw4TusQ7emK3bsJ-3"" id=""fnref-krmw4TusQ7emK3bsJ-3"">[3]</a></sup></li>
<li>There is almost definitely a gross wiring diagram hardcoded in the genome—i.e., set of connections between different neocortical regions and each other, and other parts of the brain. These connections later get refined and edited during learning. Again, we can ask how much the existence of this innate gross wiring diagram undermines CCA theory. How complicated is the wiring diagram? Is it millions of connections among thousands of tiny regions, or just tens of connections among a few regions? Would the brain work at all if you started with a random wiring diagram? I don't know for sure, but for various reasons, my current belief is that this initial gross wiring diagram is <em>not</em> carrying much of the weight of human intelligence, and thus that this point is not a significant problem for the usefulness of CCA theory. (This is a loose statement; of course it depends on what questions you're asking.) I think of it more like: if it's biologically important to learn a concept space that's built out of associations between information sources X, Y, and Z, well, you just dump those three information streams into the same part of the cortex, and then the CCA will take it from there, and it will reliably build this concept space. So once you have the CCA nailed down, it kinda feels to me like you're <em>most</em> of the way there....<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-krmw4TusQ7emK3bsJ-4"" id=""fnref-krmw4TusQ7emK3bsJ-4"">[4]</a></sup></li>
</ol>
<p>Going beyond these caveats, I found pretty helpful literature reviews on both sides of the issue:</p>
<ul>
<li>The experimental evidence <em>for</em> CCA theory: see chapter 5 of <a href=""https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/rethinking-innateness""><em>Rethinking Innateness</em></a> (1996)</li>
<li>The experimental evidence <em>against</em> CCA theory: see chapter 5 of <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Blank-Slate-Modern-Denial-Nature/dp/0142003344""><em>The Blank Slate</em></a> by Steven Pinker (2002).</li>
</ul>
<p>I won't go through the debate here, but after reading both of those I wound up feeling that CCA theory (with the caveats above) is probably right, though not 100% proven. Please comment if you've seen any other good references on this topic, especially more up-to-date ones.</p>
<p>(<strong>Update:</strong> I found another reference on CCA; see <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/8F8dagB4q4BzR5JNz/gary-marcus-vs-cortical-uniformity"">Gary Marcus vs Cortical Uniformity</a>.)</p>
<p>CCA theory does not mean ""no inductive biases""—of course there are inductive biases! It means that the inductive biases are sufficiently general and low-level that they work equally well for extremely diverse domains such as language, vision, motor control, planning, math homework, and so on. I typically think that the inductive biases are at a very low level, things like ""we should model inputs using a certain type of data structure involving temporal sequences and spatial relations"", and <em>not</em> higher-level semantic knowledge like intuitive biology or ""when is it appropriate to feel guilty?"" or tool use etc. (I don't even think object permanence or intuitive psychology are built into the neocortex; I think they're learned in early infancy. This is controversial and I won't try to justify it here. Well, intuitive psychology is a complicated case, see below.)</p>
<p>Anyway, that brings us to...</p>
<h1>CCA theory vs human-universal traits and instincts</h1>
<p>The main topic for this post is:</p>
<p><em><strong>If Common Cortical Algorithm theory is true, then how do we account for all the human-universal instincts and behaviors that evolutionary psychologists talk about?</strong></em></p>
<p>Indeed, we know that there are a diverse set of remarkably specific human instincts and mental behaviors evolved by natural selection. Again, Steven Pinker's <em>The Blank Slate</em> is a popularization of this argument; it ends with <a href=""https://willsull.net/resources/HumanUniversals.pdf"">Donald E. Brown's giant list</a> of ""human universals"", i.e. behaviors that are observed in every human culture.</p>
<p>Now, 75% of the human brain (by weight) is the neocortex, but the other 25% consists of various subcortical (""old-brain"") structures like the amygdala, and these structures are perfectly capable of implementing specific instincts. But these structures do not have access to an intelligent world-model—only the neocortex does! So how can the brain implement instincts that require intelligent understanding? For example, maybe the fact that ""Alice got two cookies and I only got one!"" is represented in the neocortex as the activation of neural firing pattern 7482943. There's no obvious mechanism to connect this arbitrary, learned pattern to the ""That's so unfair!!!"" section of the amygdala. The neocortex doesn't know about unfairness, and the amygdala doesn't know about cookies. Quite a conundrum!</p>
<p>(<strong>Update much later:</strong> Throughout this post, wherever I wrote ""amygdala"", I should have said ""hypothalamus and brainstem"". See <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/jrewt3rLFiKWrKuyZ/big-picture-of-phasic-dopamine"">here</a> for a better-informed discussion.)</p>
<p><strong>This is really a <a href=""http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Symbol_grounding_problem"">symbol grounding problem</a>, which is the other reason this post is relevant to AI alignment.</strong> When the human genome builds a human, it faces the same problem as a human programmer building an AI: how can one point a goal system at things in the world, when the internal representation of the world is a complicated, idiosyncratic, learned data structure? As we wrestle with the AI goal alignment problem, it's worth studying what human evolution did here.</p>
<h1>List of ways that human-universal instincts and behaviors can exist despite CCA theory</h1>
<p>Finally, the main part of this post. I don't know a complete answer, but here are some of the categories I've read about or thought of, and please comment on things I've left out or gotten wrong!</p>
<p><strong>Mechanism 1: Simple hardcoded connections, not implemented in the neocortex</strong></p>
<p><strong>Example: Enjoying the taste of sweet things.</strong> This one is easy. I believe the nerve signals coming out of taste buds branch, with one branch going to the cortex to be integrated into the world model, and another branch going to subcortical regions. So the genes merely have to wire up the sweetness taste buds to the good-feelings subcortical regions.</p>
<p><strong>Mechanism 2: Subcortex-supervised learning.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Example: Wanting to eat chocolate.</strong> This is different than the previous item because ""sweet taste"" refers to a specific innate physiological thing, whereas ""chocolate"" is a learned concept in the neocortex's world-model. So how do we learn to like chocolate? Because when we eat chocolate, we enjoy it (Mechanism 1 above). The neocortex learns to predict a sweet taste upon eating chocolate, and thus paints the world-model concept of chocolate with a ""sweet taste"" property. The supervisory signal is multidimensional, such that the neocortex can learn to paint concepts with various labels like ""painful"", ""disgusting"", ""comfortable"", etc., and generate appropriate behaviors in response. (Vaguely related: the DeepMind paper <a href=""https://deepmind.com/blog/article/prefrontal-cortex-meta-reinforcement-learning-system"">Prefrontal cortex as a meta-reinforcement learning system</a>.)</p>
<p><strong>Mechanism 3: Same learning algorithm + same world = same internal model</strong></p>
<p><strong>Possible example: Intuitive biology.</strong> In <em>The Blank Slate</em> you can find a discussion of intuitive biology / essentialism, which ""begins with the concept of an invisible essence residing in living things, which gives them their form and powers."" Thus preschoolers will say that a dog altered to look like a cat is still a dog, yet a wooden toy boat cut into the shape of a toy car has in fact become a toy car. I think we can account for this very well by saying that everyone's neocortex has the same learning algorithm, and when they look at plants and animals they observe the same kinds of things, so we shouldn't be surprised that they wind up forming similar internal models and representations. I found a paper that tries to spell out how this works in more detail; I don't know if it's right, but it's interesting: <a href=""http://cocosci.princeton.edu/tom/papers/gt-grammar.pdf"">free link</a>, <a href=""http://doi.org/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195176803.003.0021"">official link</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Mechansim 4: Human-universal memes</strong></p>
<p><strong>Example: Fire.</strong> I think this is pretty self-explanatory. People learn about fire from each other. No need to talk about neurons, beyond the more general issues of language and social learning discussed below.</p>
<p><strong>Mechanism 5: ""Two-process theory""</strong></p>
<p><strong>Possible example: Innate interest in human faces.</strong><sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-krmw4TusQ7emK3bsJ-5"" id=""fnref-krmw4TusQ7emK3bsJ-5"">[5]</a></sup> The subcortex-supervised learning mechanism above (Mechanism 2) can be thought of more broadly as an interaction between a hardwired subcortical system that creates a ""ground truth"", and a cortical learning algorithm that then learns to relate that ground truth to its complex internal representations. Here, Johnson's ""two-process theory"" for faces fits this same mold, but with a more complicated subcortical system for ground truth. In this theory, a subcortical system (ETA: specifically, the superior colliculus<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-krmw4TusQ7emK3bsJ-6"" id=""fnref-krmw4TusQ7emK3bsJ-6"">[6]</a></sup>) gets direct access to a low-resolution version of the visual field, and looks for a pattern with three blobs in locations corresponding to the eyes and mouth of a blurry face. When it finds such a pattern, it passes information to the cortex that this is a very important thing to attend to, and over time the cortex learns what faces actually look like (and suppresses the original subcortical template circuitry). Anyway, Johnson came up with this theory partly based on the observation that newborns are equally entranced by pictures of three blobs versus actual faces (each of which were much more interesting than other patterns), but after a few months the babies were more interested in actual face pictures than the three-blob pictures. (Not sure what Johnson would make of <a href=""https://twitter.com/FacesPics"">this twitter account</a>.)</p>
<p>(Other possible examples of instincts formed by two-process theory: fear of snakes, interest in human speech sounds, sexual attraction.)</p>
<p>(Update: See my later post <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/DWFx2Cmsvd4uCKkZ4/inner-alignment-in-the-brain"">Inner alignment in the brain</a> for a more fleshed-out discussion of this mechanism.)</p>
<p><strong>Mechanism 6: Time-windows</strong></p>
<p><strong>Examples: Filial imprinting in animals, incest repulsion (Westermarck effect) in humans.</strong> Filial imprinting is a famous result where newborn chicks (and many other species) form a permanent attachment to the most conspicuous moving object that they see in a certain period shortly after hatching. In nature, they always imprint on their mother, but in lab experiments, chicks can be made to imprint on a person, or even a box. As with other mechanisms here, time-windows provides a nice solution to the symbol grounding problem, in that the genes don't need to know what precise collection of neurons corresponds to ""mother"", they only need to set up a time window and a way to point to ""conspicuous moving objects"", which is presumably easier. The brain mechanism of filial imprinting has been studied in detail for chicks, and consists of the combination of time-windows plus the two-process model (mechanism 5 above). In fact, I think the two-process model was proven in chick brains before it was postulated in human brains.</p>
<p>There likewise seem to be various time-window effects in people, such as the Westermarck effect, a sexual repulsion between two people raised together as young children (an instinct which presumably evolved to reduce incest).</p>
<p><strong>Mechanism 7 (speculative): empathetic grounding of intuitive psychology</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Possible example: Social emotions (gratitude, sympathy, guilt,...)</strong> Again, the problem is that the neocortex is the only place with enough information to, say, decide when someone slighted you, so there's no ""ground truth"" to use for subcortex-supervised learning. At first I was thinking that the two-process model for human faces and speech could be playing a role, but as far as I know, deaf-blind people have the normal suite of social emotions, so that's not it either. I looked in the literature a bit and couldn't find anything helpful. So, I made up this possible mechanism (<em>warning: wild speculation</em>).</p>
<p>Step 1 is that a baby's neocortex builds a ""predicting my own emotions"" model using normal subcortex-supervised learning (Mechanism 2 above). Then a normal Hebbian learning mechanism makes two-way connections between the relevant subcortical structures (amygdala) and the cortical neurons involved in this predictive model.</p>
<p>Step 2 is that the neocortex's universal learning algorithm will, in the normal course of development, naturally discover that this same ""predicting my own emotions"" model from step 1 can be reused to predict other people's emotions (cf. Mechanism 3 above), forming the basis for intuitive psychology. Now, because of those connections-to-the-amygdala mentioned in step 1, the amygdala is incidentally getting signals from the neocortex when the latter predicts that <em>someone else</em> is angry, for example.</p>
<p>Step 3 is that the amygdala (and/or neocortex) somehow learns the difference between the intuitive psychology model running in first-person mode versus empathetic mode, and can thus generate appropriate reactions, with one pathway for ""being angry"" and a different pathway for ""knowing that someone else is angry"".</p>
<p>So let's now return to my cookie puzzle above. Alice gets two cookies and I only get one. How can I feel it's unfair, given that the neocortex doesn't have a built-in notion of unfairness, and the amygdala doesn't know what cookies are? The answer would be: thanks to subcortex-supervised learning, the amygdala gets a message that one yummy cookie is coming, but the neocortex also thinks ""Alice is even happier"", and that thought also recruits the amygdala, since intuitive psychology is built on empathetic modeling. Now the amygdala knows that I'm gonna get something good, but that Alice is gonna get something even better, and that combination (in the current emotional context) triggers the amygdala to send out waves of jealousy and indignation. This is then a new supervisory signal for the neocortex, which allows the neocortex to gradually develop a model of fairness, which in turn feeds back into the intuitive psychology module, and thereby back to the amygdala, allowing the amygdala to execute more complicated innate emotional responses in the future, and so on.</p>
<p>(Update: See my later post <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/DWFx2Cmsvd4uCKkZ4/inner-alignment-in-the-brain"">Inner alignment in the brain</a> for a slightly more fleshed-out discussion of this mechanism.)</p>
<p><strong>The special case of language.</strong></p>
<p>It's tempting to put language in the category of memes (mechanism 4 above)—we do generally learn language from each other—but it's not really, because apparently groups of kids can invent grammatical languages from scratch (e.g. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicaraguan_Sign_Language"">Nicaraguan Sign Language</a>). My current guess is that it combines three things: (1) a two-process mechanism (Mechanism 5 above) that makes people highly attentive to human speech sounds. (2) possibly ""hyperparameter tuning"" in the language-learning areas of the cortex, e.g. maybe to support taller compositional hierarchies than would be required elsewhere in the cortex. (3) The fact that language can sculpt itself to the common cortical algorithm rather than the other way around—i.e., <em>maybe ""grammatical language"" is just another word for ""a language that conforms to the types of representations and data structures that are natively supported by the common cortical algorithm""</em>.</p>
<p>By the way, lots of people (including Steven Pinker) seem to argue that language processing is a fundamentally different and harder task than, say, visual processing, because language requires symbolic representations, composition, recursion, etc. I don't understand this argument; I think vision processing needs the exact same things! I don't see a fundamental difference between the visual-processing system knowing that ""this sheet of paper is part of my notebook"", and the grammatical ""this prepositional phrase is part of this noun phrase"". Likewise, I don't see a difference between recognizing a background object interrupted by a foreground occlusion, versus recognizing a noun phrase interrupted by an interjection. It seems to me like a similar set of problems and solutions, which again strengthens my belief in CCA theory.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>When I initially read about CCA theory, I didn't take it too seriously because I didn't see how instincts could be compatible with it. But I now find it pretty likely that there's no fundamental incompatibility. So having removed that obstacle, and also read the literature a bit more, I'm much more inclined to believe that CCA theory is fundamentally correct.</p>
<p>Again, I'm learning as I go, and in some cases making things up as I go along. Please share any thoughts and pointers!</p>

<p>This was, in practice, deferred to the ""<a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CSEdLLEkap2pubjof/research-agenda-v0-9-synthesising-a-human-s-preferences-into#2_7_Synthesising_the_preference_function__meta_preference_about_synthesis"">meta-preferences about synthesis</a>"". In this view, rationality is just one way of resolving contradictory lower-level preferences, and we wouldn't need to talk about rationality, just observe that it existed - often - within the meta-preferences.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I think we might gain by making rationality - and its issues - an explicit part of the process.</p>
<h1>Defining rationality in preference resolution</h1>
<h2>Explicit choice</h2>
<p>We can define rationality in this area by using the <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/i6hWWcKyxBPj7ELT6/one-step-hypothetical-preferences"">one-step hypotheticals</a>. If there is a contradiction between lower-level preferences, then that contradiction is explained to the human subject, and they can render a verdict.</p>
<p>This process can, of course, result in different outcomes depending on <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5bd75cc58225bf06703754ff/our-values-are-underdefined-changeable-and-manipulable"">how the question is phrased</a> - especially if we allow the one-step hypothetical to escalate to a ""hypothetical conversation"" where more arguments and evidence is considered.</p>
<p>So the distribution of outcomes would be interesting. If, in cases where most of the relevant argument/evidence is mentioned, the human tends to come down on one side, then that is a strong contender for being their ""true"" rational resolution of the issues.</p>
<p>However, if in stead the human answers in many different ways, especially if the answer changes because of small changes in how the evidence is ordered, how long the human has to think, whether they get all the counter-evidence or not, and so on - then their preference seems to be much weaker.</p>
<p>For example, I expect that most people similar to me would converge on one answer on questions like ""<a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4ZzefKQwAtMo5yp99/circular-altruism"">does expected lives save dominate most other considerations in medical interventions?</a>"", while having wildly divergent views on ""<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mere_addition_paradox"">what's the</a> <a href=""https://www.iffs.se/media/2264/an-impossibility-theorem-for-welfarist-axiologies-in-ep-2000.pdf"">proper</a> <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ZGSd5K5Jzn6wrKckC/embracing-the-sadistic-conclusion"">population ethics?</a>"".</p>
<h2>This doesn't matter</h2>
<p>Another use of rationality could be to ask the human explicitly whether certain aspects of their preferences should matter. Many human seem to have implicit biases, whether racial or other; many humans believe that it is wrong to have these biases, or at least wrong to let them affect their decisions<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-KgZ8vFECcdSvcA7a3-1"" id=""fnref-KgZ8vFECcdSvcA7a3-1"">[1]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Thus another approach for rationality is to query the subject as to whether some aspect should be affecting their decisions or not (because humans only consider a tiny space of options at once, it's better to ask ""should X, Y, and Z be relevant"", rather than ""are A, B, and C the only things that should be relevant?"").</p>
<p>Then these kind of rational questions can also be treated in the same way as above.</p>
<h2>Weighting rationality</h2>
<p>Despite carving out a special place for ""rationality"", the central thrust of the research agenda remains: a human's rational preferences will dominate other preferences, only if they put great weight in their own rationality.</p>
<p>Real humans don't always change their views just because they can't currently figure out a flaw in an argument; nor would we want them to, especially if their own rationality skills are limited or underused.</p>

bE2sStELCj3Bppiwp,Double Tongue Whistling,double-tongue-whistling,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/bE2sStELCj3Bppiwp/double-tongue-whistling,2019-10-02T11:10:01.689Z,8,2,1,False,False,,"

I can whistle about seven notes per second, which corresponds to a
reel at 105bpm. [1]  While this isn't a problem for 

<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/bass-whistle"">whistling basslines</a> it's slightly too slow
for melodies at contra dance speed (~110-122bpm).  I want to figure
out how to whistle faster, and I know there are people who whistle
faster, but I don't know how it's usually done.



<p>

I see two main routes:

</p>

<p>

</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Do what I currently do, but faster.</p></li>
<li><p>Figure out how to do something else.</p></li>
</ul>



<p>

The former doesn't seem very promising: I've been playing around with
whistling for decades and I suspect I'm pretty close to a local
maximum with my current approach.  On the other hand, I'm just trying
to get from seven notes per second to eight, which seems like it might
be possible?

</p>

<p>

The latter is pretty open, and probably involves doing something
that's slower at first but will eventually be faster.  The main
problem is, how do I know that after I put in all that effort I'll
actually end up with something faster?  Ideally there would be people
demonstrating on youtube or something, with ""here's how to whistle
quickly"" videos, but I'm not seeing that.

</p>

<p>

Still, it seems like some sort of double-tonguing should work.
Normally when I whistle I mark the notes with my glottis, the same as
the two glottal stops in ""uh-oh"".  A different option, though, would
be to mark the notes by making a velar closure with my tongue, the
same as the two velar stops in ""cook"" (""k"").  And then I could
alternate between them, which seems like it should let me get up to
twice the speed of the slower one.  Here's what the three sound like:

</p>

<p>



</p>

<p>

I find velar stops harder, partly because it's not what I'm used to,
and partly because I'm already using my tongue to form the whistle.
Currently I can them 4-5 times per second.  When alternating I can do
a little better, 5-6 times per second, but that's still less than the
8-10 you'd expect from doubling my velar-only speed.  I can go
te-ke-te-ke with closures 10-11 times per second, so I am optimistic.

</p>

<p>

Has anyone learned to double-tongue their whistling successfully?
Does this work?

</p>

<p>
<br />

[1] Or a jig at 140bpm, since that's six notes per measure instead of
eight.

In 1961, the US had only one nuclear war plan, and it called for the destruction of every major Soviet city and military target. That is not surprising. However, the plan also called for the destruction of every major Chinese city and military target, <em>even if China had not provoked the United States</em>. In other words, the US nuclear war plan called for the destruction of the major population centers of the most populous country in the world, even in circumstances where that country had not attacked the United States or its allies. Ellsberg points out that at the time, people at RAND and presumably other parts of the US defense establishment understood that the Chinese and the Soviets were beginning to diverge in strategic interests and thus should not be treated as one bloc. Nevertheless, the top levels of the US command, including President Eisenhower, were committed to the utter destruction of both Chinese and Soviet targets in the event of a war with either country.</p><p>The policy of destroying cities is a legacy left over from strategic bombing in World War II. The destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki are the most famous, but the fire bombings of Japanese and Germany cities destroyed far more infrastructure and killed far more people than the two atomic bombs. The given rational for strategic bombing was to destroy the ability of the enemy states to continue to make war. If a state can no longer produce airplanes and tanks, either because the factories have been destroyed or because there are no longer people to work in the factories, then its ability to resist is diminished.</p><p>Given the level of technology and development in WWII, strategic bombing had a chance at achieving military objectives, because the conflict was to carry on for multiple years. On the timescale of years, a country&#x2019;s capacity to build armaments and resupply armies in the field can be crucial to victory.</p><p>Nuclear war changes this calculus. In a modern nuclear war involving SLBMs (Submarine launched ballistic missiles), ICBMs (Intercontinental ballistic missiles), strategic bombers, and other weapon systems, the majority of an adversary&#x2019;s military, industrial and population centers could be destroyed in a matter of days or hours. It is hard to imagine a nuclear war lasting years or even months. Without a prolonged war, the original rationale for strategic bombing disappears, or is at least much reduced. A state may still wish to reduce the capacity of its enemy to fight future wars, but it can no longer claim that the wholesale destruction of cities is necessary to achieve military objectives in the current war.</p><p>Why then, did early US nuclear policies call for the destruction of cities?</p><h2>Nuclear game theory in the 1960s</h2><p>The destruction of cities was primarily a threat of inflicting harm rather than an attempt to destroy the capacity of the enemy to wage war. The idea, formalized by RAND game theorist &#xA0;Thomas Schelling, was that both the United States and the Soviet Union would threaten massive retaliation against each other&#x2019;s civilian populations and industry to deter the other from starting a war.</p><p>Schelling developed a category of game theory that involved what he termed &#x201C;mixed motive games&#x201D;. Games where both sides sought advantage, but where the payoff to one side did not strictly correlate to the loss to the other side. In these types of games, both players may wish to avoid outcomes that are mutually unfavorable (Strategy of Conflict, pg. 89). In the case of nuclear deterrence, both sides strongly preferred to avoid nuclear war, and thus were both were deterred from taking actions that would directly lead to nuclear war.</p><p>Much of Schelling&#x2019;s work concerns itself with how states in a nuclear stalemate can pursue their own advantage while avoiding escalation to nuclear war. In this type of game, states try to maneuver each other into positions where the only possible actions are 1) escalate and risk nuclear war or 2) de-escalate and concede something to the other side.</p><p>During the Cuban Missile Crisis, Kennedy ordered a blockade of Cuba, believing that such an action would not be sufficient for the Soviet Union to initiate a war. The United States believed that the Soviet Union would not try to break the blockade, because such an action would be recognized by both sides as starting a (nuclear) war. Because Kennedy proved correct in his belief that the Soviet Union would not go to war over the blockade nor risk initiating war by breaking the blockade, the United States used to its advantage both countries unwillingness to go to war.</p><p>What does this have to do with the targeting cities? To answer this question it&#x2019;s necessary to consider how a nuclear war might start. Although nuclear powers would almost always prefer to avoid a nuclear war, each has an incentive to strike first if they believe nuclear war to be inevitable. By striking first they may destroy their adversary&#x2019;s nuclear forces before they can be used.&#xA0;At this point, it&#x2019;s useful to define a couple of terms. Counterforce targeting refers to the targeting of enemy military installations, especially other nuclear forces. Countervalue targeting refers to the targeting of enemy infrastructure and population centers.</p><p>Consider the primary goal of a first strike. Under the most plausible nuclear war scenarios, it is to eliminate the nuclear forces of the rival state; its objective is primarily counterforce in nature. This is markedly different than the goal of a second strike. The primary goal of a second strike, under normal assumptions of deterrence, is actually to provide fulfilment of the pre-commitment made to retaliate if ever attacked. That is, it is necessary to actually be committed to attacking second so as to avoid being attacked in the first place.&#xA0;</p><p>Schelling effectively argued that the more punishing the second strike threatened to be, the more effective the deterrent would be also. If true, then in the event of a nuclear war, a state following the optimal strategy of deterrence would target cities as well as nuclear targets to make their nuclear response as punishing as possible; that is, it would destroy both counterforce and countervalue targets. This would seem to lead to a policy for states to attack cities, without a second thought. Indeed, this was the policy of the US and the Soviet Union in the 1950s and early 1960s. However, just because targeting cities promised to be a more effective deterrent did not mean it promised to be the best policy.&#xA0;</p><p>Given some probability of nuclear war, the effectiveness of a deterrent strategy ought to be weighed against the severity of the resulting war were that strategy employed. In other words, it might make sense for a state to commit to not targeting cities in a second strike if they themselves do not have their cities destroyed in a first strike. While this may reduce the effectiveness of their deterrent (and perhaps only marginally -- nuclear war is plenty damaging without cities being destroyed -- the fallout alone will kill many millions), it may also greatly reduce the severeness of a nuclear war.&#xA0;</p><p>Herman Kahn, a prominent and controversial RAND researcher, argued that states would be rational to refrain from destroying cities in a first strike, to retain some bartering power that might allow them to save more of their own cities. The argument is that the defending force might refrain from destroying many enemy cities if doing so prevented their own cities from being destroyed. Kahn believed that the US should study and prepare for negotiating for the avoidance of US cities in a nuclear war and that in order to do this the country should:</p><ol><li>Develop the ability to have sufficiently protected or hidden nuclear forces to be able to both survive a first strike and carry out counterforce <em>and</em> countervalue attacks.</li><li>Have &#x201C;backup presidents&#x201D;, or people with authority to both order attacks and negotiate with the Soviet Union in the midst of a war, and that the US should have multiple secure locations which are staffed 24/7 by these leaders.</li></ol><p>Both Herman Kahn and Thomas Schelling agreed that negotiating the end of a nuclear war would be difficult, but both believed it was critical that nuclear states remain capable of negotiation. Schelling writes about this in his 1966 work, Arms and Influence:</p><blockquote><em>The closing stage, furthermore, might have to begin quickly, possibly before the first volley had reached its targets; and even the most confident victor would need to induce his enemy to avoid a final, futile orgy of hopeless revenge. In earlier times, one could plan the opening moves of war in detail and hope to improvise plans for its closure; for thermonuclear war, any preparations for closure would have to be made before the war starts.</em></blockquote><blockquote><em> ...A critical choice in the process of bringing a war to a successful close--or to the least disastrous close--is whether to destroy or to preserve the opposing government and its principal channels of command and communication. If we manage to destroy the opposing government&#x2019;s control over its own armed forces, we may reduce their military effectiveness. At the same time, if we destroy the enemy government&#x2019;s authority over its armed forces, we may preclude anyone&#x2019;s ability to stop the war, to surrender, to negotiate an armistice, or to dismantle the enemy&#x2019;s weapons.</em></blockquote><h2>Historical developments in US nuclear targeting policy</h2><p>The United State&#x2019;s nuclear targeting policy has evolved from one of indiscriminate destruction of military and civilian targets, including cities, to one that promises proportional retaliation. While the public documents, perhaps intentionally, do not make the US&#x2019;s position clear, their implication is that the United States would only target cities in the event that their own cities were destroyed.The first nuclear targeting plans existed in the form of <u><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_Integrated_Operational_Plan"">SIOP</a></u> (Single Integrated Operational Plan). This classified document outlined our nuclear policy starting in 1961 until 2004, and now exists in the form of the Operations Plan (OPLAN). The first SIOP specified all out targeting of both military targets and population centers, that is both counterforce <em>and</em> countervalue targeting, in both first strike and second strike scenarios. Later SIOPs contained multiple options, including the option to hold the bombing of cities in reserve.</p><p>This <u><a href=""https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/25751654.2018.1494092"">paper</a></u>: &quot;The Trump Administration&#x2019;s Nuclear Posture Review (NPR): In Historical Perspective&quot; summarizes how the Kennedy administration began to advocate for a limited war scenario that spared cities:</p><blockquote><em>President Kennedy went so far as to endorse Secretary of Defense McNamara&#x2019;s effort to get the Soviets to agree to a</em> <em>&#x201C;no cities&#x201D; nuclear targeting rule, which McNamara and the President soon abandoned in the face of objections from NATO and the US Congress as well as the Kremlin that the idea was totally unrealistic. McNamara thereupon did a 180&#xB0;turn to champion a MAD arms limitation</em> <em>(and retention) pact with the Soviets &#x2013; to prevent nuclear war by guaranteeing it will be mutually suicidal. The Johnson administration&#x2019;s effort to negotiate such a treaty with Kosygin was aborted in 1968 by the Soviet Union&#x2019;s brutal repression of the reformist Dubcek regime in Czechoslovakia. McNamara continued to work secretly with the military, however, to enlarge the menu in the SIOP</em> <em>(Single Integrated Operational Plan) from which the president could select limited and controlled nuclear responses to a nuclear attack &#x2013; preserving some possibility of a nuclear cease fire prior to Armageddon.</em></blockquote><p>Even though McNamara&#x2019;s efforts to change nuclear war plans to spare cities failed, his influence led to changes in the SIOP that for the first time specified a flexible response in nuclear war planning. Nixon would later make additional changes to the SIOP, giving the United States even more flexibility in nuclear targeting scenarios. It is not clear whether the United States ever developed a serious &#x201C;no cities&#x201D; strategy during the Cold War, but it did at least lay the foundations for one.</p><p>For the first time in US history, President Obama&apos;s administration stated the US would not target cities with nuclear weapons. However, this statement did not rule out escalation to countervalue targeting in the midst of a nuclear war, and is best interpreted to mean that the US would only target cities as a retaliatory measure. From the same Historical Perspective <u><a href=""https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/25751654.2018.1494092"">paper</a></u>:</p><blockquote><em>Yet Obama, while conceding to this presumed need to be prepared to actually use nuclear weapons in extreme situations, was not about to totally devolve the planning for such use onto the Pentagon&#x2026;. he was adamant in his guidance to the military that if that crucial threshold ever had to be crossed, all operations had to be</em> <em>&#x201C;consistent the fundamental principles of the Law of Armed Conflict. Accordingly, plans will &#x2026; apply the principles of distinction and proportionality and seek to minimize collateral damage to civilian populations and civilian objects. The United States will not intentionally target civilian populations or civilian objects&#x201D;(US Department of Defense, 2013 US Department of Defense. 2013. Report on Nuclear Employment Strategy of the United States Specified in Section 491 of 10 U.S.C. June 12.</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>The restrictive rules of nuclear engagement were translated into the military&#x2019;s doctrinal language:</em> <em>&#x201C;The new guidance,&#x201D; elaborated the Pentagon&#x2019;s June 2013 Report on Nuclear Employment Strategy, requires the United States to maintain significant counterforce capabilities</em> <em>[jargon for directed at strategic weapon systems] against potential adversaries. The new guidance does not rely on a</em> <em>&#x2018;counter-value&#x2019; or</em> <em>&#x2018;minimum deterrence&#x2019; strategy</em> <em>[jargon for directed at centers of population].</em> <em>(US Department of Defense, 2013 US Department of Defense. 2013. Report on Nuclear Employment Strategy of the United States Specified in Section 491 of 10 U.S.C. June 12.</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>Did this mean that the United States was discarding its ultimate assured destruction threat for deterring nuclear war? Clearly not. The guidance was carefully drafted. Does not rely on is different from will not resort to. But more explicitly and openly than previously, the language indicates that assured massive destruction of the enemy country would be the very last resort in an already massively escalating nuclear war, in which all the lesser options had been exhausted and had failed to control the violence.</em></blockquote><p>President Trump&#x2019;s nuclear policy, as contained in the <u><a href=""https://media.defense.gov/2018/Feb/02/2001872886/-1/-1/1/2018-NUCLEAR-POSTURE-REVIEW-FINAL-REPORT.PDF"">2018 Nuclear Posture Review</a></u>, differs in a number of ways from President Obama&#x2019;s policies, but doesn&#x2019;t substantially change the doctrine of holding the targeting of cities in reserve.</p><blockquote><em>If deterrence fails, the initiation and conduct of nuclear operations would adhere to the law of armed conflict and the Uniform Code of Military Justice. The United States will strive to end any conflict and restore deterrence at the lowest level of damage possible for the United States, allies, and partners, and minimize civilian damage to the extent possible consistent with achieving objectives.</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>Every U.S. administration over the past six decades has called for flexible and limited U.S. nuclear response options, in part to support the goal of reestablishing deterrence following its possible failure. This is not because reestablishing deterrence is certain, but because it may be achievable in some cases and contribute to limiting damage, to the extent feasible, to the United States, allies, and partners.&#xA0;</em></blockquote><h2>Conclusion and takeaways:</h2><p>The US nuclear targeting policy, in so much as public statements and documents reveal, has shifted substantially from a policy of targeting cities by default to a policy that leaves cities as reserve targets for full escalation scenarios. The US policy has never ruled out the possibility of escalation to full countervalue targeting and is unlikely to do so.</p><p>The maxim &#x201C;no plan survives contact with the enemy&#x201D; is especially worrying from the perspective of nuclear war planning. During the early cold war years described in Daniel Ellsberg&#x2019;s book, the military culture promoted a dedication to nuclear readiness--so much so that officers violated their own protocols to ensure they could launch nuclear weapons in a crisis. Readiness for retaliation, especially full countervalue retaliation, naturally trades off against risk of full escalation.&#xA0;</p><p>As both Herman Kahn and Thomas Schelling made clear, communication between legitimate authorities is essential to the ability to negotiate the end of a nuclear conflict. Yet the military value of disabling an enemy&#x2019;s nuclear command, control, and communications (NC3) capabilities is large. This may be the biggest risk to cities; if Moscow and Washington are both destroyed in the early stages of nuclear conflict, then this could easily escalate to all out countervalue targeting. It is important not only that some command structure with the authority to negotiate remain intact on each side, but also that both parties can communicate with each other and trust that the adversary&#x2019;s command structure is actually intact and capable of negotiation.</p><p>Finally, all of this means very little if either of two potential adversaries fail to make plans for a) refraining from initial targeting of cities b) maintaining NC3 capabilities through an initial nuclear strike, and c) have the authority and intention to negotiate a peace &amp; de-escalation. Indeed, <u><a href=""https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/reports/2005/R2154.pdf"">public statements</a></u> by Soviet leadership during the cold war suggested they had no intention of sparing cities in a retaliatory strike, making any possible US policy of gradual escalation potentially useless. Ultimately, it&#x2019;s important to recognize here that not all nuclear war scenarios have equal outcomes, and that both sides in a nuclear conflict could benefit greatly from engaging in strategic restraint.</p>",jeff-ladish,landfish,Jeffrey Ladish,

One of the ways technology interacts with culture is about who's job
it is to avoid contacting people at bad times.  With older
technologies there were clear conventions based on their limitations:



<ul>
<li><p>Mail: you can send the letter whenever, and the person will deal
with it when convenient.</p></li>

<li><p>Phone: don't call someone when they might be asleep, but if you
work nights unplug your phone during the day.</p></li>
</ul>



<p>

It's more complicated now, though, because the new ways of contacting
people all boil down to ""a message goes from your phone to theirs"" and
their phone may or may not be configured to let them know about the
message.  I think the rules basically come down to:

</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If the default configuration is either always silent or has a
nightly ""quiet period"" then you can send whenever and not worry about
waking people.</p></li>

<li><p>Otherwise treat it as if it will wake people up unless you
happen to know that this particular person has configured their app
differently.</p></li>
</ul>



<p>

In the first category we have email, Slack, and probably some other
apps.  In the second we have phone, SMS, Whatsapp, FB Messenger, Hangouts,
Signal, and almost everything else.

</p>

<p>

Overall this is a bad equillibrium: it would be better to at least
have the option to send your message whenever, and if the person is
asleep they'll get it in the morning.  The receiver has a much better
idea of when are ok times for notifications than the sender does . But
there's currently no way to know how someone has their device
configured, so you generally need to stay on the safe side and wait
for a reasonable hour before sending.

</p>

<p>

If we did successfully move from ""sender guesses do-not-disturb"" to
""receiver's device tracks do-not-disturb"", however, it would be good
to have some sort of override.  For example, if you called me in the
middle of the night ideally you would get an automated message saying
that I'm asleep, but offering you the option to press a button to get
reach me if it's urgent enough that you want to wake me up.  Systems
where calls from trusted contacts bypass do-not-disturb don't do this
well: not every late-night call from my sister is intended to wake me
up, and there are people who may need to contact me urgently that I
won't have thought to configure in my phone.

I stumbled upon this research poster on Alpha Centauri, the kind which they only display in dull corridors. Shortly after, my double-PhD physics teacher (the kind they put in dull corridors) walked behind me saying &quot;hi&quot;. Yes, a physics teacher saying &quot;hi&quot;, play your suspension of disbelief card. I was taken by surprise and wondered about the reasons he had to greet me (usually he didn&apos;t), but I managed to remember I had to answer. I answered &quot;hjwjv&quot;.</p><p>Later on, I tried wanting to say &quot;hey&quot; and a &quot;hey&quot; sound emanated from my vocal cord: the volition-and-body-movements-are-connected belief still paid rent.</p><p>As a thesis-angsted graduate student, I thought...<em>Analysis Paralysis</em>...</p><p>There seems to be profound reasoning behind oneself overboard paralytic social thinking: a consciousness of the incompressible whole that is such a concept as a <em>person</em> and, by extension, the induced exponential data processing from trying to scale this whole, the type of thinking that forbids any action. <em>Analysis Paralysis.</em></p><p>Consider the brain: billions of neurones firing in what any derivative would consider an instantaneous lapse of time, capable of reason, technique, reflective thinking, of abstraction, of abstraction square. The current mathematical instruments are unable to model this complexity and the current humans will probably be unable to cognitively model those models between two lines of dialogue.</p><p>To &#x201C;hjwjv&#x201D; when you want to &#x201C;hey&#x201D; is to acknowledge in the other&#x2019;s self this same bunch of dreads, dreams, sorrows, ambitions that define your own world; an empathetic awe realization of the hidden information singularizing into a slangish west Germanic greeting device. Unable to take into account the size of prior knowledge collapsing in a &#x201C;hey&#x201D;, the hardware crashes. Humbly, the shy acknowledges that the complexity of a mere conversation is beyond the scope of seizable magnitudes. </p><p>Now one might take this as proof of moral superiority. Only the social incompetent considers people as ends, not mere tools to his goals. Only he can conceptualize the deep true nature of a human-human relation. If the charismatic extravert seems to know, the shy him knows he does not. There is nothing to change about it.</p><p>But it doesn&apos;t work like this...</p><p>Putting aside the fact <em>homo sapiens</em> is a social animal and confronting your genes hasn&apos;t a good record in the dopamine/serotonin sector, shyness or social anxiety is detrimentally influencing on your rationality. Isolating any group from a larger population as always been the best way to form a closed spirituality, that is false beliefs. More so if the group in question is a unique mind.  You may find yourself (or not, that&apos;s the real danger) holding a belief that, through no fault of your own (yeah you could have read more Lesswrong posts, but I mean...), is irrational. That&apos;s no big deal as long as you correct it when enough evidence of its shift w/t reality is collected. Except, a fair proportion of the evidence we gather comes from other human beings&apos; mouth. By hiding yourself from social activity, you blind yourself to many pieces of evidence; your probabilities do not take the whole data into account.</p><p>Bayesian thinking is only a function, you need input, you need evidence.</p><p>Textual and audio-visual content can play this role to a certain extent, but they are jammed one-way traffic: No one to answer your questioning afterward and you need to toss away a lot of evidence that does not make any significant change to your beliefs before getting to some useful ones. Sometimes the content is mainly evidence about what your model predicts at 99% and none about those beliefs you give only 60% confidence in. </p><p>The rational shy or socially unfit should, by recognizing the wholeness of a person, see an opportunity to encounter with a great pool of evidence. The other one can then pinpoint evidence about beliefs you&apos;re unsure about: dialectic. The other can even have so much evidence about something that you end up stealing his belief. This kind of person is called an expert and this kind of interaction is called teaching. In terms of efficiency, it&apos;s hard to surpass.</p><p>This is why something like a comments section is sacred. Or an open source for the sake of it...</p><p>Shyness and social difficulties may result from a more realistic picture of human minds, but this picture also calls into action, into bayesian evidence collecting. It doesn&apos;t bring you anyhow closer to this far Alpha Centauri you are looking at in the stary night, there is simply a brick wall circumscribing your whole line of sight: it doesn&apos;t help you get there, but it puts things in perspective.</p>",Paperhopes,paperhopes,Paperhopes,

<p>Idea, content and rationale derived from <a href=""https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/C/bo23521678.html"">Booth et al.: The Craft of
Research</a>, p. 32. Here is the whole section about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Creating a Writing Group</p>
<p>A downside of academic research is its isolation. Except for group projects,
you'll read and write mostly alone. But it doesn't have to be that way. Look for
someone other than your instructor or adviser who will talk with you about your
progress, review your drafts, even pester you about how much you've written.
That might be a generous friend, but even better is another writer so that you
can comment on each other's ideas and drafts.</p>
<p>Best of all is a group of four or five people working on their own projects who
meet regularly to read and discuss one another's work. Early on, each meeting
should start with a summary of each person's project in this three-part
sentence: <em>I'm working on X because I want to find out Y, so that I (and you)
can better understand Z</em> (more about this in 3.4). As your projects advance,
develop an opening ""elevator story,"" a short summary of your project that you
could give someone on the way to a meeting. It should include your research
question, your best guess at an answer, and the kind of evidence you expect to
use to support it. The group can then follow up with questions, responses, and
suggestions.</p>
<p>Don't limit your talk to just your story, however. Talk about your-readers: Why
should they be interested in your question? How might they respond to your
argument? Will they trust your evidence? Will they have other evidence in mind?
Such questions help you plan an argument that anticipates what your readers ex-
pect. Your group can even help you brainstorm when you bog down. Later the group
can read one another's outlines and drafts to imagine how their final readers
will respond. If your group has a problem with your draft, so will those
readers. But for most writers, a writing group is most valuable for the
discipline it imposes. It is easier to meet a schedule when you know you must
report to others.</p>
<p>Writing groups are common for those writing theses or dissertations. But the
rules differ for a class paper. Some teachers think that a group or writing
partner provides more help than is appropriate, so be clear what your instructor
allows.</p>

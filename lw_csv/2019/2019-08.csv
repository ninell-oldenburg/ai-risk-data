When I listened to the first ninety minutes of a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM9f0W2KD5s"">three-hour conversation between Eric Weinstein and Peter Thiel</a>, I was surprised to hear echoed a lot of ideas we've discussed on LessWrong about stagnation in academia and scientific discourse more generally (e.g. <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xQ9tMMk3RArodLtDq/intellectual-progress-inside-and-outside-academia"">here</a> and <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/nXZi8efFArfk3u568/extended-quote-on-the-institution-of-academia"">here</a>). I realised there was no good online transcript for people to read, discuss, and link to, so in my off-work hours as a hopefully useful public service, I thought I’d try my hand at making one, and used a format inspired by other podcasts who do the same (in this case, the often brilliant <a href=""https://80000hours.org/podcast/"">80,000 Hours Podcast</a>). </em></p><p><em>I've split it into five posts for readability.

And the reason for this is that in late modernity, which we are living in, there's simply too much knowledge for any individual human to understand all of it. And so in this world of extreme hyper specialization, where it's narrower and narrower subsets of experts policing themselves and talking about how great they are, the string theorists talking about how great string theory is, the cancer researchers talking about how they're just about to cure cancer, the quantum computer researchers are just about to build a quantum computer, there'll be a massive breakthrough. And then if you were to say that all these fields, not much is happening, people just don't have the authority for this. And this is somehow a very different feel for science or knowledge than you would've had in 1800 or even in 1900. In 1800, Goethe could still understand just about everything. 1900, Hilbert could still understand just about all of mathematics and so this sort of specialization, I think, has made it a much harder question to get a handle on. </blockquote><blockquote><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>The political cut I have on the specialization is always that if you analyze the politics of science, the specializations should make you suspicious, because if it's gotten harder to evaluate what's going on, then it's presumably gotten easier for people to lie and to exaggerate, and then one should be a little bit suspicious. And that's sort of my starting bias.</blockquote><hr class=""dividerBlock""><blockquote><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>So, let me focus you on two subjects that are important for trying to figure out the economy going forward. I'm very fond of perhaps over-claiming, but making a strong claim for physics. That physics gave us atomic devices and nuclear power, and it ended World War II definitively. It gave us the semiconductor, the worldwide web, theoretical physicists invented molecular biology, the communications revolution. All of these things came out of physics, and you could make the argument that physics has been really underrated as powering the world economy.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>On the other hand, it's very strange to me that we had the three-dimensional structure of DNA in '53, we had the genetic code 10 years later, and we've had very little in the way of, let's say, gene therapy to show for all of our newfound knowledge. Now, I have no doubt that we are learning all sorts of new things - to your point about specialization - in biology, but the translation hasn't been anything like what I would have imagined for physics.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>So, it feels like somehow we're in a new orchard, and we're spending a lot of time exploring it, but we haven't found the low hanging fruit in biology, and we've kind of exhausted the physics orchard, because what we've found is so exotic that, you know, whether it's two black holes colliding, or a third generation of matter, or quark substructure, we haven't been able to use these things. Are we somehow between revolutions?</blockquote><hr class=""dividerBlock""><p>On increasing the number of students with a higher education:</p><blockquote><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>One of my friends is a professor in the Stanford economics department, and the way he describes it to me is they have about 30 graduate students starting PhDs in economics at Stanford every year. It's six to eight years to get a PhD. At the end of the first year, the faculty has an implicit ranking of the students, where they’ve sort of agreed who the top three or four are. The ranking never changes. The top three or four have, are able to get a good position in academia, the others not so much.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>And, you know, we're pretending to be kind to people, and we're actually being cruel.</blockquote><hr class=""dividerBlock""><blockquote><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Amazon is the most threatening of the big tech companies in that it's threatening a lot of other companies elsewhere in the industry and disrupting them and making things more efficient, but probably with a lot of sheer forces at work in that process. So, I agree that that's a candidate for automation or productivity improvements or things like that. I'm still not convinced that it's in the aggregate shifting things that much, and then you can go through all sorts of individual job descriptions where people used to have secretaries because typing was a skill, and with a word processor you don't quite need this. You can do short emails. You don't quite need a secretary. People still have executive assistants that sort of somehow do slightly different set of responsibilities, but it's not clear we have fewer executive assistants than we used to have secretaries. </blockquote><blockquote><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>So, when one actually concretizes it, it's not quite clear how disruptive the automation that's happening really is. Again, it's a version of the tech stagnation thing. It's always the last 40, 50 years, things have been slow. We're always told it's about to accelerate like crazy. That may be true. In some ways, I hope that's true, but if one was simply extrapolating from the last 40 to 50 years, perhaps the default is that we should be more worried about the lack of automation than excess automation.</blockquote><hr class=""dividerBlock""><blockquote><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>Something that sort of fits in here is that, in part I've learned from you, and you can tell me whether you recognize this formulation or not, is start with any appealing social idea. That's step one. Step two, ask what is the absolute minimal level of violence and coercion that would be necessary to accomplish that idea. Now add that to the original idea. Do you still find your original idea attractive? This flips many of these propositions into territory where I suddenly realized that something that people see as being very attractive actually can only be accomplished with so much misery, even if it's done maximally efficiently, that it's no longer a good idea. This has been very influential in my thinking.</blockquote><hr class=""dividerBlock""><blockquote><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Well, I think that it's very hard to see how anything like the kinds of societies we have in Western Europe, the United States, could function without growth. I think the way sort of a parliamentary republican democracy works is you have a group of people sitting around the table, they craft complicated legislation, and there's a lot of horse trading, and as long as the pie's growing, you can give something to everybody. When the pie stops growing, it becomes a zero sum dynamic, and the legislative process does not work. So, the sort of democratic types of parliamentary systems we've had for the last 200, 250 years have mapped on to this period of rapid growth. We had sort of a very bad experiment in the 1930s where the growth stopped, at least from the economic sense, and the systems became fascist or communist. It doesn't actually work.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>So, I suspect that if we're in for a period of long growth <em>[Ben: I think Peter here means “a period where growth is a long way away”]</em>, I don't think our kind of government can work. I think there is a prospect of all sorts of forms of violence, more violence by the state against its citizens. There may be more zero sum wars globally, or there may be other ways things are super deformed to pacify people. So, maybe everyone just smokes marijuana all day, but that's also kind of deformed. But I think a world without growth is either going to be a much more violent or a much more deformed world. And again, it's not the case that growth simply solves all problems. So, you can have very rapid growth, and you can still have the problem of violence. You can still have bad things that can happen, but that's our only chance. Without growth, I think it's very hard to see how you have a good future.</blockquote><hr class=""dividerBlock""><blockquote><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>Let me take a slightly different tack. Two statements that I found later in life unfortunately, but have both been meaningful to me. One is Weber's definition that a government is a monopoly on violence. And the other one, it's a guy I can never remember who said, I think it was a French political philosopher who said, ""A nation is a group of people who have agreed to forget something in common."" If you put these things together, if you imagine that somehow we've now gone in for the belief that transparency is almost always a good thing and that what we need is greater transparency to control the badness in our society, we probably won't be able to forget anything in common. Therefore, we may not be able to have a nation, and therefore the nation may not be able to monopolize violence, which is a very disturbing but interesting causal chain. Can we explore the idea of transparency, given that people seem to now associate certain words with positivity, even though normally we would have thought about privacy, transparency, trade-offs, let's say?</blockquote><hr class=""dividerBlock""><blockquote><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>It's interesting, in a moment where I wanted to make sure that my son didn't misbehave, I toured him around our neighborhood and pointed out all of the cameras that would track anybody on the street where we live. I had never noticed them before, but sure enough there they were in every nook and cranny that we don't realize that if it has to be stitched together, there's an incredible web of surveillance tools that are surrounding us at all time. </blockquote><hr class=""dividerBlock""><blockquote><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>It strikes me that there are ways we don't want to wake up. We don't want to wake up in a way where it de-energizes us and demotivates. I think one of the ways I think these institutions worked was they took care of people, but it was also motivational. You study. You get good grades. You'll succeed in our system. One way, when you deconstruct these institutions, there's one direction that I think is always very dangerous, that it just shifts people into a much more nihilistic, very low energy mode where it's just, ""Well, there's no point. Nothing can be done."" That's the way that I definitively do not want to wake people up.</blockquote><h1>Links to Things Discussed in the Podcast</h1><ul><li><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h10kXgTdhNU"">Peter Thiel’s Interview on The Rubin Report</a></li><li>Paul Krugman’s Essay “<a href=""https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/03/09/a-protectionist-moment/?mtrref=www.google.co.uk&amp;gwh=3288F8967EECB31B02619B86B880EE26&amp;gwt=pay&amp;assetType=REGIWALL"">A Protectionist Moment</a>”</li><li>Eric Weinstein’s 2011 Edge Essay <a href=""https://www.edge.org/response-detail/11783"">Kayfabe</a></li><li>Contrarian Physicist <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Schwinger?oldformat=true"">Julian Schwinger</a></li><li><a href=""https://www.seeking.com/"">Seeking Arrangements</a>, Website for Sugar Daddies and Sugar Babies to meet</li><li><a href=""https://thielfellowship.org/"">Thiel Fellowship</a>, Offering $100k to undergrads to drop out of university</li><li><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law?oldformat=true"">Power Laws</a>, (not discussed but related: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJphn1T8tIc"">Anders Sandberg talking about heavy-tailed distributions</a>)</li><li><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preference_falsification?oldformat=true"">Preference Falsification</a>, an idea from Timur Kuran’s book <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Private-Truths-Public-Lies-Falsification/dp/0674707583"">Private Truths, Public Lies</a></li><li>Historian and Philosopher of Social Science <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Girard?oldformat=true"">Rene Girard</a></li><li>Girard’s book “Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World” (<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Things-Hidden-Since-Foundation-World/dp/0804722153"">Amazon</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Things_Hidden_Since_the_Foundation_of_the_World?oldformat=true"">Wikipedia</a>)</li><li>The Theory of Phlogiston (<a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/RgkqLqkg8vLhsYpfh/fake-causality"">LW Sequences</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phlogiston_theory?oldformat=true"">Wikipedia</a>) </li><li>Jennifer Freyd’s theory of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_betrayal?oldformat=true"">Institutional Betrayal</a></li><li>Aubrey de Grey proves <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/XSnpjmgbezStLi6RE/the-chromatic-number-of-the-plane-is-at-least-5-aubrey-de"">The Chromatic Number of the Plane is At Least 5</a></li></ul><p>Links not explicitly referred to but that (I think) give strong arguments for positions discussed and are perhaps implicitly referred to:</p><ul><li><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/FS6NCWzzP8DHp4aD4/do-earths-with-slower-economic-growth-have-a-better-chance"">Do Earths with Slower Economic Growth have a Better Chance at FAI?</a></li><li><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ZiRKzx3yv7NyA5rjF/the-robots-ai-and-unemployment-anti-faq"">Eliezer</a> and <a href=""https://www.gwern.net/Mistakes#neo-luddism"">Gwern</a>’s respective takes on Automation </li><li><a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/8m3wj1/rothschilds_in_crypto_goodbadneutral/dzmspgv/"">Vitalik Buterin on the importance of privacy</a> </li></ul><h1>Other Discussion on the Web</h1><ul><li><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20465053"">Hacker News</a></li><li><a href=""https://medium.com/@rishdotblog/peter-theil-and-eric-weinstein-on-the-portal-episode-1-a-summary-298ccd0251a9"">Podcast Summary by Rishabh Srivastava</a></li><li><a href=""https://nintil.com/links-28/"">Nintil’s “Links (28) &amp; Peter Thiel” by José Luis Ricón</a></li><li><a href=""https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/vRuZGTYYCssraBavN/link-thiel-on-gcrs"">EA Forum</a></li><li><a href=""https://podcastnotes.org/2019/07/17/thiel/"">Podcastnotes.org</a></li><li><a href=""https://bigthink.com/politics-current-affairs/eric-weinstein-education"">Big Think</a></li></ul><p>(Let me know about more, either in the comments or via PM.)</p><h1>Interview</h1><h2>Introduction</h2><p><strong>Eric Weinstein:</strong> Hello and welcome to The Portal's first episode. Today, I'll be sitting down with Peter Thiel. Now, if you've been following me on Twitter, or perhaps as a podcast guest on other podcasts, you may know that I work for Thiel Capital. But one of the things that people ask me most frequently is, given that you are so different than your boss and friend Peter Thiel, how is it the two of you get along? What is it that you talk about? Where do you agree and disagree? Now, oddly, Peter and I both do a fair amount of public speaking. But I don't believe that we've ever appeared in public together and very few people have heard our conversations. What's more, he almost never mentions me, and I almost never mentioned him in our public lives.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein:</strong> So hopefully this podcast will give some indication of what a conversation is like with somebody who I find one of the most interesting and influential teachers of our time; somebody who has influenced all sorts of people in Silicon Valley involved with technology and inventing tomorrow, and who is often not seen accurately, in my opinion, by the commentariat and the regular people who opine as pundits in the world of science and technology.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein:</strong> I hope you'll find Peter as fascinating as I do. Without further ado, this is the first episode of The Portal. Thanks for joining us.</p><h2>Personal Backgrounds</h2><p><strong>Eric Weinstein:</strong> Hello and welcome. You found The Portal. I'm your host, Eric Weinstein, and I think this is our first interview show to debut, and I'm here with my good friend and employer, Mr. Peter Thiel. Peter, welcome to The Portal.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel:</strong> Well, Eric, thanks for having me on your program.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein:</strong> No, this is a great honor. One of the things I think is kind of odd is that lots of people know that I work for you and many people know that we're friends, but even though we both do a fair amount of public speaking, I don't think we've ever appeared any place in public together. Is that your recollection as well?</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel:</strong> I can't think of a single occasion. So this proves we're not the same person.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein:</strong> We're not the same person, yeah. You are not my alter ego. But on that front, I think it is kind of an odd thing for me. I mean, we met each other, I think when I was in my late 40s, and if you'd ever told me that the person who would be most likely to complete my thoughts accurately would be you, I never would have believed it, never having met you. We have somewhat opposite politics. We have very different life histories. How do you think it is that we've come to share such a lot of thinking? I mean, I have to say that a lot of my ideas are cross pollinated with yours. So you occur in a lot of my standard riffs. How do you think it is that we came to different conclusions, but share so much of a body of thought?</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel:</strong> So I'm always hard pressed to answer that, since the conclusions all seem correct to me. And it's always mysterious why it feels like we're the outliers and we're among the very few people that reach some of these conclusions about the relative stagnation in science and technology, the ways in which this is deranging or culture, our politics, our society, and then how we need to try to find some bold ways out; some bold ways to find a new portal to a different world.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel:</strong> And I think there are different ways the two of us came at this. I feel like you got to some of these perspectives at a very early point, sort of the mid 1980s, that something was incredibly off. I probably got there in the early, mid-90s, when I was from this track law firm job in New York city. And somehow everything felt like it was more like a Ponzi scheme. It wasn't really going towards the future everyone had promised you, in the elite undergraduate and law school education I had gone through.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel:</strong> And so, yeah. So I think there was sort of a point, we got to these insights. But it's still striking how out of sync they feel with so much of our society, even in 2019.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein:</strong> Yeah, I mean, that's a very striking thing for me. And it's also something that's frustrated me. Sometimes, when I look forward to you being interviewed, it often feels to me that so much time is spent on the initial question,""Are we somewhat stagnating in science and technology,"" that rather than assuming that as a conclusion - which I think we can make a pretty convincing argument that there has been a lot of stagnation - it seems to me that a lot of these conversations hang at an earlier level. And so one of the things that I was hoping to do in this, which is, I think, your second long form podcast. You did Dave Rubin's show sometime ago ... Is to sort of presuppose some of the basics that people will be familiar with who've been following either one of us, or both of us, and to get to the part of the conversation that I think never gets explained and discussed, because people are always so hung up at the initial frame issue.</p><h2>What is the dominant narrative?</h2><p><strong>Eric Weinstein:</strong> So with your indulgence, let's talk a little bit about what you and I see, and any differences that we might have, about this period of time that we find ourselves in, in 2019. What would you say is the dominant narrative before we get to what might be our shared counter narrative?</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Well, you know, the dominant narrative is probably fraying and has been fraying for some time, but it is something like we're in a world of generally fast scientific and technological progress. Things are getting better all the time. There's some imbalances that maybe need to be smoothed out. There's some corner case problems. Maybe there's some dystopian risks, because the technology is so fast and so scary that it might be destructive. But it's a generally accelerationist story. And then there's some sort of micro-adjustments within that, that one would have to make.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>There's are all sorts of ways that I think it's fraying. I think 2008 was a big watershed moment, but that still what's largely been holding together. And then there's sort of different institutions. You can look at the universities where there's a tracked thing. It's costing more every year, but it's still worth it. It's still an investment in the future. And this was probably already questionable in the 1980s, 1990s. College debt in the United States in 2000 was $300 billion. Now it's around in $1.6 trillion, $1.7 trillion. And so there's a way in which the story was shaky 20 years ago and today is much shakier. It's still sort of holding together somehow.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein:</strong> So in this story, in essence, the great dream is that your children will become educated, they will receive a college education, they will find careers. And in this bright and dynamic society, they can look forward to a future that is brighter than the future that previous generations look forward to.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel:</strong> Yeah, so I think ... Now again, I think people are hesitant to actually articulate it quite that way, because that already sounds not quite true to-</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein:</strong> Well, to your point, they've been adding epicycles for some time.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel:</strong> And so it's a ... Maybe it's a bright future, but it's really different from the parents, because we can't quite know. And they have all these new devices. They have an iPhone and they can text really fast on the iPhone. We can't even understand what the younger generation is doing. So maybe it's better on ... But ""better"" has sort of an objective scale. Maybe it's just different and unmeasurable, but better in sort of an unmeasurable way.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel:</strong> So there sort of are ways it's gotten modified but, that would still be a very powerfully intact narrative. And then that there are sort of straight forward things we can be doing. The system's basically working, and it's basically going to continue to work. And they're sort of a global version of this. There's a US version. There's an upper middle class US version. There's a lot of different variations on this.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein:</strong> So it always strikes me that one of the things that you do very well is that you're willing - and you know, you're famously a chess player - you're willing to make certain sacrifices in order to advance a point. And in this case, I think you and I would both agree that there's certain areas that have continued to follow the growth story more than the general economy, and that you have to kind of give those stories their due before you get to see this new picture. Where do you think the future has been relatively more bright in recent years?</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel:</strong> Well, again I sort of date this era of relative stagnation and slowed progress all the way back to the 1970s, so I think it's been close to half a century that we've been in this era of seriously slowed progress. Obviously, a very big exception to this has been the world of bits: Computers, internet, mobile internet, software. And so Silicon Valley has somehow been this dramatic exception. Whereas the world of atoms has been much slower for something like 50 years.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel:</strong> And you know, when I was an undergraduate at Stanford in the late 1980s, almost all engineering disciplines, in retrospect, were really bad fields to go into. People already knew, at the time, you shouldn't go into nuclear engineering. AeroAstro was a bad idea. but you know, chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, all these things were bad fields. Computer science would've been a very good field to go into. And that's been sort of an area where there's been tremendous growth.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>So that's sort of the signature one that I would cite. There are questions about how healthy it is, at this point, even within that field. So, you know, the iPhone is now looking the same as it did seven, eight years ago. So that's the iconic invention. Not quite so sure. And so there's been sort of a definitely a change in the tone even within Silicon Valley in the last five, six years on this. But that had been one that was very, very decoupled.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>The decoupling itself had some odd effects, where if you have sort of a narrow cone of progress around this world of bits, then the people who are in those parts of the economy that have more to do with atoms will feel like they're being left behind. And so there was something, there was something about the tech narrative that had this very ... Didn't necessarily feel inclusive, didn't feel like everybody was getting ahead. And one of the ways I've described it is that we live in a world where we've been working on the Star Trek computer in Silicon Valley, but we don't have anything else from Star Trek. We don't have the warp drive, we don't have the transporter, we can't re-engineer matter in sort of this cornucopian world where there is no scarcity. And how good is a society where you have a well-functioning Star Trek computer, but nothing else from Star Trek?</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>Yeah, that's incredibly juicy. I mean, one of the ways that I attempted to encode something, which, in part I got from you, was to say, ""Of course your iPhone is amazing. It's all that's left of your once limitless future,"" because it's the collision of the communications and the semiconductor revolutions that did seem to continue. And I date the sort of break in the economy to something like 1972, '73, '74. It's really quite sharp in my mind. Is it that way in yours?</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Yes. I'd say 1968, people still ... The narrative progress seemed intact. By '73, it was somehow over. So somewhere in that five-year period. The 1969 version was we landed on the moon in July of 1969 and you know, Woodstock starts three weeks later. And maybe that's one way you could describe the cultural shift. You can describe it in terms of the oil shocks in 1973 at the back end. With the benefit of hindsight, there were things that were already fraying by the late 1960s, so the environment was getting dramatically worse.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>Right.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>You have the graduate movies, you should go into plastics. I think that was 1968 or '69. So there were sort of things where the story was fraying, but I think it was still broadly intact in 1968, and somehow seemed very off by '73.</p>",Benito,benito,Ben Pace,

You can then ask questions like <em>&quot;what is the probability that U is less than 10?&quot;</em> or, in other words, <em>&quot;how many outcomes have U&lt;10, and how likely are they?&quot;</em>. With those questions we can draw a probability density function for our utility distribution.</p><span><figure><img src=""https://i.ibb.co/THvPCRv/U-1.png"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:40%"" /></figure></span><p>Here is a sketch of one such distribution. I&#x27;m going to assume that it is normal or common and then compare others to it. X-axis is utility (&quot;bad&quot; on the left, &quot;good&quot; on the right) and Y-axis is probability (the bottom line is 0). The peak in the middle says that some values of U are common for many outcomes. The tails on ether side say that the outcomes with very large of very low values of U are unlikely.</p><span><figure><img src=""https://i.ibb.co/v3j9hxN/U-2.png"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:40%"" /></figure></span><p>Here is another sketch. The left tail is heavy, meaning that &quot;bad&quot; outcomes are more likely than in the common distribution. An agent with this U distribution would exhibit caution or inaction, because the risk/reward ratio of most actions would be awful. The agent would say <em>&quot;what if I fail?&quot;</em>. However, if precautions are taken, this agent would exhibit much more normal reward-seeking behavior. This state seems similar to human fear or anxiety.</p><span><figure><img src=""https://i.ibb.co/NVCb6zG/U-3.png"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:40%"" /></figure></span><p>Here is a similar distribution, but now the right tail is very thin, meaning that &quot;good&quot; outcomes are near-impossible. This agent would exhibit caution and inaction, just like the previous one. However this one would rather say <em>&quot;what&#x27;s the point?&quot;</em>. If nothing good is going to happen, then its best option is to stop wasting resources. At best the agent could try to prepare in case some misfortune may randomly befall it. This state seems similar to human depression.</p><span><figure><img src=""https://i.ibb.co/z8gfZck/U-4.png"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:40%"" /></figure></span><p>Finally, a distribution with a thicker right tail, meaning that &quot;good&quot; outcomes are likely. This agent should be very active, since many actions will have great risk/reward. This could make the agent take unnecessary risks and waste resources. However, if the agent has well calibrated beliefs, this can lead to great productivity. In humans, similar states range from optimism to mania.</p><p>I believe that there is a direct relation between human emotions or mental states and the functions U and P. For example, it&#x27;s hard to separate <em>&quot;I&#x27;m afraid&quot;</em> from <em>&quot;I believe that I&#x27;m in danger&quot;</em>. It&#x27;s not clear which comes first and which causes the other. Maybe they are the same thing? Also consider treatments such as CBT and exposure therapy, that affect mental states by changing people&#x27;s beliefs. If feelings and beliefs were independent, these should not work as well as they do.</p><p><strong>proposition:</strong> Some human emotions can be interpreted as labels for categories of utility distributions.</p><p>If this is true, then analyzing utility functions directly may be more informative than working with the labels. Then, instead of asking yourself <em>&quot;what do I feel&quot;</em>, you should ask yourself <em>&quot;what do I believe&quot;</em> and <em>&quot;what do I value&quot;</em>.</p><p><strong>corollary:</strong> Rationality often protects us from wild fluctuations in our values and beliefs. If our cat died, we could jump to the conclusion that we will be devastated for years. But if we know how poorly people estimate their future happiness (see &quot;affective forecasting&quot;), we will have more accurate beliefs, therefore our distribution will be less disturbed, and therefore we will feel less depressed. In this way rationality makes us more Spock-like.</p><p><strong>notes</strong>:</p><ul><li>The shape of a distribution is by no means sufficient to explain all behavior. It matters, for a given point (u0,p0), if it represents one outcome with that probability or a large group of very different outcomes with much smaller probabilities. Also, it matters what actions are possible and what utilities each action leads to. Still, this simple view seems useful.</li><li>I don&#x27;t think that the &quot;common&quot; distribution is symmetric - there is always a good chance of dying, but there is hardly anything comparable on the positive side. I&#x27;m ignoring this for simplicity.</li><li>Normally we talk about expected utility of some action. However here I&#x27;m marginalizing the distribution over all possible actions. This is problematic - how do we assign probabilities to actions we haven&#x27;t chosen yet? It&#x27;s also not entirely necessary, we can talk about the distribution for some specific action. I&#x27;m ignoring this for simplicity.</li><li>Do people even have utility functions? I don&#x27;t think it matters. I think something similar could be said about a more general human choice function, though it would be more awkward.</li><li>Do other emotions work like that? E.g. anger or love? The shape of the distribution may not be sufficient for them, but I believe that other properties of U and P might work.</li><li>What about other shapes? E.g. what if the distribution has two peaks? Who knows, maybe there is a label for that. Although there doesn&#x27;t have to be one, especially if it&#x27;s not a common shape.</li></ul>",zulupineapple,zulupineapple,zulupineapple,

In the first failure mode, the agent&apos;s capabilities fail to generalise. In the second, its capabilities generalise, but its objective does not. This second failure mode seems in general more dangerous: if an agent is sufficiently capable, it might, for example, hinder human attempts to shut it down (if its capabilities are robust enough to generalise to situations involving human attempts to shut it down). These failure modes map to what Paul Christiano calls benign and malign failures in <em><a href=""https://ai-alignment.com/techniques-for-optimizing-worst-case-performance-39eafec74b99"">Techniques for optimizing worst-case performance</a></em>.</p><p>This distinction suggests a framing of robustness that we have found useful while writing our report: instead of treating robustness as a scalar quantity that measures the degree to which the system continues working off-distribution, we can view robustness as a 2-dimensional quantity. Its two axes are something like &#x201C;capabilities&#x201D; and &#x201C;alignment&#x201D;, and the failure modes at different points in the space look different.</p><p><img src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vmikulik/essays/master/2d_robustness/Figure_1_v2.JPG"" class=""draft-inline-image"" alt=""fig 1""> </p><p>Unlike the 1-d picture, the 2-d picture suggests that more robustness is not always a good thing. In particular, robustness in capabilities is only good insofar is it is matched by robust alignment between the mesa-objective and the base objective. It may be the case that for some systems, we&#x2019;d rather the system get totally confused in new situations than remain competent while pursuing the wrong objective.</p><p>Of course, there is a reason why we usually think of robustness as a scalar: one can define clear metrics for how well the system generalises, in terms of the difference between performance on the base objective on- and off-distribution. In contrast, 2-d robustness does not yet have an obvious way to ground its two axes in measurable quantities. Nevertheless, as an intuitive framing I find it quite compelling, and invite you to also think in these terms.</p>",vlad_m,vlad-mikulik,Vlad Mikulik,

<p>On Facebook, my friend Tyler <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/tyleralterman/posts/10214636828938815"">writes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lately, I've been having an alarming amount of conversations arise about the burdens of loneliness, alienation, rootlessness, and a lack of belonging that many of my peers feel, especially in the Bay Area. I feel it too. Everyone has a gazillion friends and events to attend. But there's a palpable lack of social fabric. I worry that this atomization is becoming a world-wide phenomenon – that we might be some of the first generations without the sort of community that it's in <em>human nature</em> to rely on.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And that the result is a worsening epidemic of mental illness...</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Without the framework of a uniting religion, ethnicity, or purpose, it's hard to get people to truly commit to a given community. Especially when it's so easy to swipe left and opt for things that offer the fleeting <em>feeling</em> of community without being the real thing: the parties, the once-a-month lecture series, the Facebook threads, the workshops, the New Age ceremonies. We often use these as ""community porn"" – they're easier than the real thing and they satisfy enough of the craving. But they don't make you whole.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I've had some thoughts about experiments to try. But then I think about how hard it is (especially in this geographic area) to get people to show up to something on at least a weekly basis. Even if it's for something really great. I see many great attempts at community slowly peter out.</p>

<a href=""https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000316"">Loneliness is bad for your health</a>.  It's bad for <a href=""https://www.ft.com/content/89f16688-fb15-11e7-a492-2c9be7f3120a"">society's</a> <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/23/opinion/loneliness-political-polarization.html"">health</a>.</p>
<p>Having a smartphone that keeps you entertained all day, and enough money to live by yourself, might sound like first world problems.  But they are likely contributors to loneliness.  And as developing countries get richer, they'll start having first world problems too.  So I think addressing loneliness could be very high-leverage for the world.</p>
<p>People are starting businesses to address loneliness: you can pay someone to <a href=""https://www.kcrw.com/news/shows/greater-la/have-a-friend-call-you-regularly-for-a-fee/effective-cure-for-loneliness-pay-a-monthly-fee-to-rent-a-friend"">call you periodically</a> or <a href=""https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-city-beat-people-walker-loneliness-20190516-story.html"">take you for a walk</a>.  But I'd argue these services are a band-aid in the same sense that parties, workshops, and ceremonies are.  They don't solve the underlying problem: You're still alone by default instead of together by default.</p>
<h1>Roommates Could Be a Great Solution</h1>
<p>Sociologists <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/15/fashion/the-challenge-of-making-friends-as-an-adult.html"">think</a> there are three conditions necessary for making friends: proximity; repeated, unplanned interactions; and a setting that encourages people to let their guard down and confide in each other.  These conditions tend to be present during college for many people, but not afterwards.</p>
<p>Why do people find it easier to make friends in college?  Maybe it's because college students don't usually live alone.</p>
<p>Going to events doesn't work because (a) you don't typically get repeated interactions with the same person and (b) events take place at a scheduled time.  Which may or may not be a time you're feeling lonely.</p>
<p>If you have a lot of roommates, all you have to do is step outside your room and find someone to chat with.  No transportation CO2 emissions needed.  But more important, you know your roommates are always gonna be around.</p>
<h1>But I Already Have Roommates</h1>
<p>Even if you already have roommates, I think there's a good chance your roommate situation is under-optimized.  Given that you spend so much time with them, there's a lot of value in living with people you really connect with.  (Finding great coworkers makes sense for similar reasons.)</p>
<p>The layout of your house and the number of roommates you have can also make a big difference.  I used to have friends living in a 4-bedroom place where all the bedrooms opened directly into a single large common area.  If anyone else was outside their room, you'd immediately know it and have an opportunity for interaction.  Later I lived in an 8-bedroom place which felt far lonelier, even with every room occupied.  The house was laid out so it was easy to go about your day without ever running into a fellow roommate.  I also lived in a house with over 50 bedrooms for a while, which was wild &amp; a lot of fun.</p>
<h1>But I Don't Want Roommates</h1>
<p>One reason you might not want roommates is because you're worried you might have conflicting preferences for what living together should be like.  For example, my philosophy towards dirty dishes is to let them pile up on the counter and periodically stuff them all in the dishwasher, to be as time-efficient as possible.  Surprisingly, some people dislike this approach.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.roomiematch.com"">RoomieMatch.com</a> is a website which tries to solve the roommate compatibility problem.  You create a profile by answering questions about dishes, food in the fridge, housecleaning, social events, noise, overnight guests, shared household items, walking around in your underwear, TV, etc.  In addition, there are questions to help predict how you well you will connect as people.</p>
<h1>You Could Make a Lot of Money</h1>
<p>RoomieMatch has two search options: free and cheap.  Cheap costs $20/year.</p>
<p>The problem with RoomieMatch is they're leaving a massive amount of money on the table.</p>
<p>A few years ago, a friend of mine was jobless &amp; struggling financially.  He was living in a 4-bedroom house at the time, and he was the primary contact with the landlord.  My friend took responsibility for vetting folks from Craigslist in order to fill the remaining rooms in the house.  He found that folks from Craigslist were willing to pay enough rent for the remaining 3 rooms that he was able to live rent-free until he found a job.</p>
<p>I acknowledge this is murky ethical territory, and I'm not condoning my friend's actions.  (I don't believe anyone ever found out or got upset, for whatever that's worth.)  The point I'm trying to make is that property management is way more lucrative than roommate matching.  RoomieMatch makes $20 per user per year at best.  My friend was making $100+ per user per <em>month</em>.</p>
<p>What I'm suggesting is that you take the <a href=""https://a16z.com/2015/01/22/the-full-stack-startup/"">full-stack startup</a> playbook which has been successful in Silicon Valley recently, and apply it to online roommate matching + property management.</p>
<p>The extreme full-stack approach is to own your own properties.  Apparently the US has a <a href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-growing-problem-in-real-estate-too-many-too-big-houses-11553181782"">surplus of big houses</a> right now.</p>
<p>There are already <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/19/shared-housing-startups-are-taking-off/"">players in this space</a> such as <a href=""https://www.roam.co"">Roam</a> which are proving that people will pay for community.  (As if people paying extra to live in hip cities like SF &amp; NYC didn't prove that already.  BTW, I found that the <a href=""https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/sigun924gsxN4oZq2/the-case-for-the-ea-hotel"">awesome community</a> at the <a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/08/20/practically-a-book-review-ea-hotel/"">Athena Hotel</a> more than made up for the fact that it's in a non-hip city.)  Anyway, I think existing players are mostly pursuing the extreme full-stack option.  I actually think this is the wrong play.  You want to be a marketplace, like Airbnb (valued at over $30 billion).  The more people who are using <em>your</em> tool, the finer-grained roommate matching services you can provide.  It's hard to achieve massive scale if you have to own every property.  You want to be playing matchmaker for individuals with common interests who all happen to be looking for rooms around the same time, plus landlords with empty houses.  Maybe you'll want to undercut RoomieMatch, and provide free matching services for people who live in their properties, in order to achieve the necessary scale.  (RoomieMatch's existing scale is impressive by the way--I quickly got 100+ active, vetted matches in a midsize US city when I tried the tool.  If you have the money you might want to just buy it.)</p>
<p>So instead of buying properties, maybe you just want to contact people selling large homes &amp; see if you can convince them to let you manage their property.</p>
<p>Note that this is a good company to start if a recession happens, since people who currently live alone will be thinking about how to save on rent.</p>
<h1>This Could Be Really Great</h1>
<p>Most roommate search tools, like Craigslist, don't make it easy to figure out if a future roommate is someone you'd actually want to live with.  Imagine reaching a scale where you could match people based on factors like:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>They love to play board games, or pool, or Super Smash Bros.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They want a compost pile and a garden in their backyard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One has a pet, and the other likes animals but isn't yet ready to make a lifetime commitment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They want a squat rack in the basement to save time &amp; money going to the gym.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They want to continue partying like college students after graduation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They want to be part of an intentional community devoted to mutual improvement and life optimization, or spirituality, or whatever.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They want to <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4esQ684vtR9zcjHgW/i-want-to-live-in-a-baugruppe"">share childcare responsibilities</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They're all fans of the same sports team.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They enjoy reading and discussing the same genre of novels, or watching the same movies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They're musicians looking for people to jam with.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They want to live near hiking trails and go on group hikes together.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They want to do independent study of the same topic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They're trying to eat a healthier diet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They just moved to a new city and want friends they can explore the city with.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They have the same unusual work schedule.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One needs a caretaker, and the other wants to make extra money.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They like the idea of having a couch or two listed on <a href=""https://www.couchsurfing.com"">CouchSurfing</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One knows a language the other wants to learn.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They work close together in the same expensive metropolitan area and want save on housing.  So they live in the outskirts of the city and commute together every day using the diamond lane.  One drives and the other pays for gas.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I also see opportunities to reduce friction in the current roommate matching process:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Automatically find times when everyone is available for a meet &amp; greet video call.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let people take virtual tours of the houses on offer to minimize driving.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No need to worry about breaking a lease if someone moves to a different house in your company's network.  Let people try out a few communities &amp; see what works for them.  Use machine learning to improve your matching as you gather more data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide external mediation in the event of roommate disputes, and have a reputation system to encourage good behavior.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You aren't providing <em>housing</em> as a service (like Airbnb), or <em>companionship</em> as a service (like the people-walking startup).  You're providing <em>community</em> as a service.  You could even organize mixers across your houses.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Technology has been blamed for the loneliness epidemic, but I think we can use technology to cure the loneliness epidemic as well.</p>
<p>I'm too busy being obsessed with machine learning to start any company which isn't mostly about that.  But I think this is a product the world needs, and I want you to build it.  I encourage you to sign the <a href=""https://founderspledge.com"">Founders Pledge</a> and donate the money to <a href=""https://www.effectivealtruism.org"">effective charities</a> in case you actually end up making billions of dollars as a result of reading this.</p>
<p>I apologize if you found the tone of this post overly sales-y.  My goal was to light a spark in the right person.  (Feel free to steal phrases from this post when pitching investors!)</p>
<p>Some folks in the rationalist community might be a little underwhelmed by this idea, since people in the rationalist community have been living together in group houses for a long time.  The thing is, finding roommates by connecting based on mutual interests via the internet is still kind of weird in the eyes of the general public.  As Paul Graham <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/startupideas.html"">put it</a>: ""Live in the future, then build what's missing.""  The existence of so many lonely people proves that this option is still missing for most people.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you're interested in building/investing in this, please comment below, or send me a private message via my <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/users/john_maxwell"">user page</a> with the country you're in and I'll put you in contact with others who message me.

The result was the report “<a href=""https://www.evaluationinnovation.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/2016-RT-Benchmarking-Report-1.pdf"">Benchmarking Foundation Evaluation Practices</a>,” and it contains one of the most amazing facts I’ve encountered in nearly two decades of working in the social sector.</p><p>In response to a question about the challenges they encounter in their work, <strong>more than three-quarters of respondents said they have a hard time commissioning evaluations that yield meaningful insights for their own foundations.</strong> To put that in plainer language: most of the folks who commission evaluations of social programs have trouble getting people — <em>including even their own colleagues</em> — to use them. And this is coming from the people whose <em>job</em> it is to commission those evaluations, so if anything we’d expect them to be biased against admitting there’s any problem. Not only that, each of the top <em>four</em> challenges identified by foundation evaluation professionals were all related to use, and all experienced by more than 7 in 10 respondents.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href=""https://twitter.com/iandavidmoss/status/1113554885662990336"">@iandavidmoss</a></p></blockquote><p>Some might suppose that this has something to do with the choice of study design, but foundations that commission randomized controlled trials (RCTs) didn’t seem to fare much better. Of the foundations that funded RCTs, only 38% reported that they actually drove grantmaking decisions. And just 25% found them useful for developing strategy.</p><p>It’s no surprise, then, that survey respondents hoped to see substantial changes to the way the field designs and uses evaluations going forward.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href=""https://twitter.com/iandavidmoss/status/1113554890205356032"">@iandavidmoss</a></p></blockquote><p>These numbers are eye-popping, but you could be forgiven for wondering how much stock to put in them. After all, this is only one study. What if it was just a fluke?</p><p>Sadly, there is plenty of other research that demonstrates we are experiencing a crisis of evidence use in our field. Taken together, they strongly reinforce the point that people with influence over social policy simply don’t read or use the vast majority of the knowledge we produce, no matter how relevant it is.</p><p>One of my favorite factoids of all time comes from a <a href=""http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/387501468322733597/Which-World-Bank-reports-are-widely-read"">study the World Bank conducted on its own policy papers</a> several years ago. The methodology was simple: researchers just counted the number of times each paper had been downloaded between 2008–12. They found that three-quarters of these papers, each one representing likely hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars of investment on the institution’s part, were downloaded fewer than 100 times. Nearly a third had never been downloaded <em>even once</em> — not even by their authors!</p><figure><img src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/533/1*niFl1--RYToPrUMWz89j8A.jpeg"" /></figure><p>This was all chronicled in a Washington Post article with the unforgettable title, “<a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/05/08/the-solutions-to-all-our-problems-may-be-buried-in-pdfs-that-nobody-reads/"">The Solutions to All Our Problems May Be Buried in PDFs Nobody Reads</a>.” Touché!</p><p>Research that asks policymakers and philanthropists about their reading habits tells a similar story. <a href=""https://hewlett.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Hewlett-Field-Scan-Report.pdf"">Funders responding to a survey of more than 700 foundation professionals</a> sponsored by the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation reported being completely overwhelmed with information, to the point where some of them just delete emails announcing new reports and studies without even skimming them first to see if they’re relevant.</p><figure><img src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/367/1*WaXMUT1njQQ6P00-HEFruA.png"" /></figure><p>In a <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/08/13/these-3-barriers-make-it-hard-for-policymakers-to-use-the-evidence-that-development-researchers-produce/"">study of over 1600 civil servants in Pakistan and India by Harvard’s Evidence for Policy Design initiative</a>, policymakers “agreed that evidence should play a greater role in decision-making” but acknowledged that it doesn’t. According to the study, the issues are structural: “Few [respondents] mentioned that they had trouble getting data, research, or relevant studies. Rather, they said…that they had to make decisions too quickly to consult evidence and that they weren’t rewarded when they did.” And the topline finding of <a href=""https://www.ehpsa.org/critical-reviews/policymakers-and-evidence"">an EHPSA/INASP study study looking at HIV policymakers in eastern and southern Africa</a> is that “policymakers value evidence but they may not have time to use it.”</p><p>What about front-line practitioners? A US survey found doctors generally don’t follow research relevant to their practice area, and when research comes out that challenges the way they do their work, <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/10/03/we-know-that-evidence-based-medicine-works-so-why-dont-politicians-support-it/?noredirect=on"">they expect their medical associations to attack it</a>. Meanwhile, the UK’s Educational Endowment Foundation conducted an actual randomized controlled trial to test strategies to get evidence in front of schoolteachers. They tried online research summaries, magazines, webinars, conferences. <a href=""https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/news/light-touch-approaches-unlikely-to-have-impact-on-pupil-outcomes/"">None of these “light-touch” methods had any measurable effect on student outcomes</a>.</p><figure><img src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/966/1*mwap4w7MDgcRhkYk13b0XQ.png"" /></figure><p>It’s important to note that none of this is news to the people who make it their business to generate and advocate for the use of evidence. In my experience, the vast majority of such professionals know this is a huge problem and have their own stories to tell. For example, <a href=""https://onthinktanks.org/articles/latin-american-evidence-week-10-emerging-lessons/"">this report from the 2017 Latin American Evidence Week</a> decried the “operational disconnect [that] makes it impossible for evidence generated at the implementation level to feed into policy (and programme) design.” It’s also why 125 social sector leaders interviewed by Deloitte Monitor Institute’s Reimagining Measurement initiative <a href=""https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/monitor-institute/articles/re-imagining-measurement-strategic-learning-toolkit.html"">identified “more effectively putting decision-making at the center” as the sector’s top priority for the next decade</a>.</p><p>The consistent theme across all these readings is that <strong>it’s really tough to get policymakers and other people in power to use evidence, especially when it challenges their beliefs.</strong> We’re barely aware of most of the evaluation and research that’s relevant to our work. When we encounter it, we usually don’t read it. When we read it, we often don’t use it. It is very, very rare that evidence on its own will actually influence the views or actions of influential people.</p><p>What’s really astounding about this is how much time, money, attention we spend on evidence-building activities for apparently so little concrete gain. With such depressing results, we could just throw up our hands and say, “well, no one’s going to read this stuff anyway, so why bother?”</p><p>But we don’t. Instead, it’s probably not an exaggeration to say that our society invests millions of hours and billions of precious dollars toward generating knowledge about the social sector — most of which will have literally zero impact.</p><p>In short, we can’t decide what we really think as a society about evidence. We <em>aspire</em> to let it drive our actions, but in <em>practice</em> it seldom does. So we are either vastly overvaluing or vastly undervaluing the act of building knowledge. And we need to get it right, because those are real resources that could be spent elsewhere, and the world is falling apart around us while we get lost in our spreadsheets and community engagement methodologies.</p><p>Don’t get me wrong — I believe in science!

<h2>Summary of paper</h2>
<p>Despite the amount of recent work done, human-inperceptible perturbation adversarial attacks (Example: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA4YEAWVpbk"">One Pixel Attack</a>) are not as useful as the researchers may think, for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>They are not based on realistic attacks against these AI systems.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>we were unable to find a compelling example that required indistinguishability.</p>
<p>... the best papers on defending against adversarial examples carefully articulate and motivate a realistic attack model, ideally inspired by actual attacks against a real system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are much better attack methods where a real adversary could use:</p>
<ul>
<li>Test-set attack. Just keep feeding it natural inputs until it gets an error. As long as the system is not error-free this will succeed.</li>
<li>It's suggested that such attacks can be used to fool speeding cameras, by adding human-invisible dots to a license plate. But if one is actually caught speeding, the failure of the algorithm would simply prompt a human review. Much more usefully, one can use clear sprays that are intended to overexpose any photographed image of the licence plate.</li>
<li>Similarly, it's suggested that a perturbation attack could threaten to make a self-driving car to misidentify a STOP sign. But any robust self-driving car must deal with situations much worse than that, such as the stop sign not existing, not visible, and <a href=""https://consumerist.com/2017/05/11/the-real-problem-with-self-driving-cars-they-actually-follow-traffic-laws/"">people breaking the traffic rules</a>.</li>
<li>Against security cameras which automatically identify blacklisted people, one can wear a good mask. Since there probably are humans monitoring the camera feed, it's necessary to fool both the camera and the humans. Imagine a monitoring system that automatically displays people's real faces on camera and the best match faces. A human monitor would immediately notice the discrepancy.</li>
</ul>
<ol start=""2"">
<li>They are not very fruitful for improving robustness.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>In practice, the best solutions to the l_p problem are essentially to optimize the metric directly and these solutions seem not to generalize to other threat models.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>My speculations</h2>
<p>If so much work has been done for such dubious gains, I have two bitter questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Why did they work on the perturbation attacks so much?</li>
<li>Why are these works so fun to read?</li>
</ol>
<p>The second question partially answers the first: because they are fun. But that can't be the only explanation. I think the other explanation is that perturbational adversarial examples are <em>easy</em>, because they can be defined in one short equation, and trained without domain knowledge (just like the neural networks themselves).</p>
<p>As for why these works are so fun to read, I think it's because they are extremely humorous, and confirms comforting beliefs about human superiority. The humor comes from the contrast between tiny perturbations in input and big perturbations in output, between incomprehensible attacks and comprehensible results, between the strange behavior of neural networks and the familiar behavior of humans.</p>

I&apos;m keeping this post up for historical value. </p><p>---------------</p><p><em>This post introduces the <u><a href=""http://parallelforecast.com/docs/resolution/"">AI Forecasting Resolution Council</a></u>, a group of researchers with technical expertise in AI who will allow us to expand the space of effectively forecastable questions. It is the second part in <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/8y7DcSF4eAkXoru4u/ai-forecasting-dictionary-forecasting-infrastructure-part-1-2"">a series of blog posts</a> which motivate and introduce pieces of infrastructure intended to improve our ability to forecast novel and uncertain domains like AI.</em></p><p><em>The Council is currently in beta, and we&apos;re launching early to get feedback from the community and quickly figure out how useful it is.</em></p><h3>Background and motivation</h3><p>A key challenge in (AI) forecasting is to write good questions. This is tricky because we want questions which <em>both</em> capture important uncertainties, <em>and</em> are sufficiently concrete that we can resolve them and award points to forecasters in hindsight. </p><p>Here are some example questions within AI that make this especially difficult: </p><p><strong>Counterfactual questions </strong></p><p>Suppose in 2000 you use &#x201C;superhuman Othello from self-play&#x201D; as a benchmark of a certain kind of impressive AI progress, and forecast it to be possible by 2020. It seems you were correct -- very plausibly the AlphaZero architecture should work for this. However, in a strict sense your forecast was wrong -- because no one has <em>actually</em> bothered to build a powerful Othello agent without relying on handcrafted evaluation functions (EDIT: thanks to Vanessa Kosoy for pointing out that otherwise superhuman Othello systems exist). </p><p>So if a calibrated forecaster faces this question in 2000, considerations regarding who will bother to pursue what project &#x201C;screen off&#x201D; considerations regarding fundamental drivers of AI progress and their gradients. Yet the latter concern is arguably more interesting.</p><p>This problem could be solved if we instead forecasted the question &#x201C;<em>If </em>someone were to run an experiment using the AI technology available in 2020, given certain resource constraints, <em>would </em>it seem with &gt;95% confidence, that they&#x2019;d be able to create a superhuman Othello agent that learnt only from self-play?&#x201D;</p><p>Doing so requires a way of evaluating the truth value of that counterfactual, such as by asking a group of experts. </p><p><strong>Similarity questions </strong></p><p>Suppose we try to capture performance by appealing to a particular benchmark. There&apos;s a risk that the community will change its focus to another benchmark. We don&#x2019;t want forecasters to spend their effort thinking about whether this change will occur, as opposed to fundamental question about the speed of progress (even if we <em>would</em> want to track such sociological facts about which benchmarks were prominent, <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/o6GS3JoWKeuuvBPSK/separation-of-concerns"">that should be handled by a <em>different</em> question</a></u> where it&#x2019;s clear that this is the intent). </p><p>So to avoid this we need a sufficiently formal way of doing things like comparing performance of algorithms across multiple benchmarks (for example, if RL agents are trained on a new version of Dota, can we compare performance to OpenAI Five&#x2019;s on Dota 2?).</p><p><strong>Definition-of-terms questions</strong></p><p>This is more straightforward and related to the <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/8y7DcSF4eAkXoru4u/ai-forecasting-dictionary-forecasting-infrastructure-part-1-2"">AI Forecasting Dictionary</a></u>. For example, how do we sufficiently clearly define what counts as &#x201C;hard-coded domain knowledge&#x201D;, and how much reward shaping you can add before the system no longer learns from &#x201C;first principles&#x201D;?</p><p><strong>Valuation questions</strong></p><p>Not all important uncertainties we care about might be able to be turned into a concretely operationalised future event. For example, instead of trying to operationalise how plausible the IDA agenda will seem in 3 years by making a long, detailed specification of the outcome of various experiments, we might just ask &#x201C;How plausible will IDA seem to this evaluator in 3 years?&#x201D; and then try to forecast that claim. </p><p>Making this work will require carefully choosing the evaluators such that, for example, it is generally easier and less costly to forecast the underlying event than the opinions of the evaluator, and that we trust that the evaluation actually tracks some important, natural, hard-to-define measure. </p><p>Prediction-driven evaluation is a deep topic, yet if we could make it work it is potentially very powerful. See e.g. <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/YX6dCo6NSNQJDEwXR/p/kMmNdHpQPcnJgnAQF"">this post</a></u> for more details. </p><h3>AI Forecasting Resolution Council</h3><p>As a step towards solving the above problems, we&#x2019;re setting up the AI Forecasting Resolution Council, a group of researchers with technical expertise in AI, who are volunteering their judgement to resolve questions like the above.</p><p>The services of the council are available to any forecasting project, and all operations for the council will be managed by <u><a href=""http://parallelforecast.com/"">Parallel Forecast</a></u>. In case there is more demand for resolutions than can be filled, Parallel will decide which requests to meet.</p><p>We think that this Council will create streamlined, standardised procedures for dealing with tricky cases like the above, thereby greatly expanding the space of effectively forecastable questions.</p><p>There are still many questions to be figured out regarding incentives, mechanism design, and question operationalisation, and we think that by setting up the Resolution Council, we are laying some groundwork to begin experimenting in this direction; and discover best practices and ideas for new, exciting experiments.</p><p>The initial members of the council are: </p><ul><li><u><a href=""http://danielfilan.com/"">Daniel Filan</a></u> (CHAI)</li><li><u><a href=""http://cundy.me/"">Chris Cundy</a></u> (Stanford)</li><li><u><a href=""https://www.gleech.org/about/"">Gavin Leech</a></u> (Bristol)</li><li><u><a href=""https://ought.org/team"">William Saunders</a></u> (Ought)</li></ul><p>We expect to be adding several more members over the coming months.</p><p>The database of previous verdicts and upcoming resolution requests can be found <u><a href=""http://parallelforecast.com/docs/resolution/"">here</a></u>. </p><h3>How to use the council if you run a forecasting project</h3><p>If you&#x2019;re attempting to forecast AI and have a problem that could be solved by querying the expert council at a future state, let us know by <u><a href=""https://airtable.com/shrcTu1CICNhnTRRa"">filling in this resolution request form</a></u>. </p><h3>How to join the council</h3><p>If you have technical expertise in AI and would be interested in contributing to help expand the space of forecastable questions, let us know using <u><a href=""https://forms.gle/p3C6damDv8qgZbdF7"">this form</a></u>. </p><p>There is no limit on the number of judges, since we can always randomise who will vote on each distinct verdict. </p>",jacobjacob,bird-concept,Bird Concept,

A future superintelligent Google Translate would be able to translate texts faster and better than any human translator, capturing subtleties of language beyond what even a native speaker could pick up. It might be able to understand hundreds of languages, handle complicated multilingual puns with ease, do all sorts of amazing things. But in the end, it would just be a translation app. It wouldn’t want to take over the world. It wouldn’t even “want” to become better at translating than it was already. It would just translate stuff really well.</blockquote><blockquote>...</blockquote><blockquote>In this future, our AI technology would have taken the same path as our physical technology. The human body can run fast, lift weights, and fight off enemies. But the automobile, crane, and gun are three different machines. Evolution had to cram running-ability, lifting-ability, and fighting-ability into the same body, but humans had more options and were able to do better by separating them out. In the same way, evolution had to cram book-writing, technology-inventing, and strategic-planning into the same kind of intelligence – an intelligence that also has associated goals and drives. But humans don’t have to do that, and we probably won’t. We’re not doing it today in 2019, when Google Translate and AlphaGo are two different AIs; there’s no reason to write a single AI that both translates languages and plays Go. And we probably won’t do it in the superintelligent future either. Any assumption that we will is based more on anthropomorphism than on a true understanding of intelligence.</blockquote><blockquote>These superintelligent services would be safer than general-purpose superintelligent agents. General-purpose superintelligent agents (from here on: agents) would need a human-like structure of goals and desires to operate independently in the world; Bostrom has explained ways this is likely to go wrong. AI services would just sit around algorithmically mapping inputs to outputs in a specific domain.</blockquote><br><p>A takeaway:</p><br><blockquote>I think Drexler’s basic insight is that Bostromian agents need to be really different from our current paradigm to do any of the things Bostrom predicts. A paperclip maximizer built on current technology would have to eat gigabytes of training data about various ways people have tried to get paperclips in the past so it can build a model that lets it predict what works. It would build the model on its actually-existing hardware (not an agent that could adapt to much better hardware or change its hardware whenever convenient). The model would have a superintelligent understanding of the principles that had guided some things to succeed or fail in the training data, but wouldn’t be able to go far beyond them into completely new out-of-the-box strategies. It would then output some of those plans to a human, who would look them over and make paperclips 10% more effectively.</blockquote><blockquote>The very fact that this is less effective than the Bostromian agent suggests there will be pressure to build the Bostromian agent eventually (Drexler disagrees with this, but I don’t understand why). But this will be a very different project from AI the way it currently exists, and if AI the way it currently exists can be extended all the way to superintelligence, that would give us a way to deal with hostile superintelligences in the future.</blockquote>",ioannes_shade,ioannes_shade,ioannes,

A few examples:</p><ul><li><u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/GSqFqc646rsRd2oyz/p/34XxbRFe54FycoCDw"">The Bottom Line</a></u></li><li>Asking “Why do I believe what I believe?”</li><li>Examining systematic flaws in our belief-producing process, i.e. <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/5g5TkQTe9rmPS5vvM"">biases</a></u></li><li>Noticing beliefs stemming from inaccurate sources, i.e. <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/pmHZDpak4NeRLLLCw/p/bMkCEZoBNhgRBtzoj"">anchoring</a></u>, <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/pmHZDpak4NeRLLLCw/p/rHBdcHGLJ7KvLJQPk"">fictional evidence</a></u>, <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/buixYfcXBah9hbSNZ/we-change-our-minds-less-often-than-we-think"">changing our minds less often than we think</a></u></li><li><u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/oFePMp9rKftEeZDDr/p/QkX2bAkwG2EpGvNug"">Engines of cognition</a></u></li></ul><p>If the causal chain from territory to map is broken outright, then that’s a pretty obvious problem, but some of the links above provide more subtle examples too. In general, map-making processes should produce accurate maps <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/oFePMp9rKftEeZDDr/p/QrhAeKBkm2WsdRYao"">to exactly the extent that they approximate Bayesian reasoning</a></u>.</p><p>Point is: looking at the cause-and-effect processes which produce maps/beliefs is pretty central to rationality.</p><p>Given all that, it’s rather odd that we don’t have a nice mathematical theory of <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/t5DFpygMqpnFsmJ3b/cartographic-processes"">map-making processes</a></u> - cause-and-effect systems which produce accurate maps/beliefs from territories.</p><p>We have many of the pieces needed for such a theory laying around already. We have a solid <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/SqFbMbtxGybdS2gRs/p/hzuSDMx7pd2uxFc5w"">theory of causality</a></u>, so we know how to formalize “cause-and-effect processes”. Information theory lets us quantify <u><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_information"">map-territory correspondence</a></u>. We even have an intuitive notion that accurate map-making processes should approximate Bayesian inference.</p><p>Yet there’s some large chunks missing. For instance, suppose Google collects a bunch of photos from the streets of New York City, then produces a streetmap from it. The vast majority of the information in the photos is thrown away in the process - how do we model that mathematically? How do we say that the map is “accurate”, despite throwing away all that information? More generally, maps/beliefs tend to involve some abstraction - my beliefs are mostly about macroscopic objects (trees, chairs, etc) rather than atoms. What does it mean for a map to be “accurate” at an abstract level, and what properties should my map-making process have in order to produce accurate abstracted maps/beliefs?</p>",johnswentworth,johnswentworth,johnswentworth,

(If that is confusing just keep reading it will be blatantly clear at the end.) A hidden assumption is a necessary condition that was not stated. If it is claimed that something is sufficient but it is not, this must lead to a logical contradiction once a rule is applied that is only applicable if the statement is indeed sufficient. If indeed B follows from A alone, then A can not be without B. But if in reality there is a side condition for B other than A, then A can be without B. This thinking can be used to check the completeness of assumptions.

The village sculptor was hired, but the sculptor had no idea how large to make the emperor’s nose.</p><p>The elders conferred. Nobody in the village had ever seen the emperor, nor heard anything about his nose, so they all had wildly different estimates of the size of the emperor’s nose. The elders argued about the right size for hours, until one particularly wise elder stood to address the room.</p><p>“Our estimates are too noisy,” the wise elder declared, “In order to improve them, we should employ the wisdom of the crowd. We will ask each person in the village to estimate the length of the emperor’s nose. Then, we can average together the results to obtain an estimate of high precision.”</p><p>This proposition was put to a vote, and the elders quickly agreed, eager to end the hours of argument before they missed the early-bird special at the village buffet. The next day, each villager was asked to estimate the length of the emperor’s nose, in millimeters. The elders averaged together all the responses, and estimated the emperor’s nose was 15.49 mm long.</p><h2>The Cargo Cult (Feynman again)</h2><p>During World War II, many remote pacific islands became military bases for the American navy. On one such island, the native inhabitants worked with the sailors in exchange for food, clothing and other supplies. All these supplies were flown in plane, and landed on an airstrip.</p><p>After the war, the Americans left the empty airstrip behind. The planes stopped delivering supplies.</p><p>The natives wanted to get more supplies. So, they tried to make the planes land. They went out to the airstrip and did everything the sailors had done. They lit small, regularly spaced fires along the sides of the airstrip. They had someone sit at the side of the strip talking into a wooden box while wearing pieces of wood shaped to look like headphones. They had others stand on the airstrip and gesture with sticks. In short, they did everything they had seen the sailors do.</p><p>But the planes just didn’t land.</p><h2>The Missing Quarter (Boy Scout tradition)</h2><p>A boy was pacing back and forth at night under a streetlamp, apparently searching the ground, when another boy passed by.</p><p>“What are you looking for?” asked the newcomer.</p><p>“My quarter. I dropped it,” replied the searcher.</p><p>“Oh. I’ll help you look,” offered the newcomer.</p><p>The two continued the search for a minute or so before a third boy came along.</p><p>“What are you two looking for?” asked the third.</p><p>“A quarter he dropped,” replied the second, indicating the original boy.</p><p>“Let me help,” said the third, and set to searching.</p><p>This continued for some time, and the crowd grew steadily. Finally, a girl showed up.</p><p>“What are you all looking for?” she asked.</p><p>“My quarter. I dropped it,” replied the original boy.</p><p>“Well where did you drop it?” asked the girl.</p><p>“Over there,” said the boy, indicating an area off to the side.</p><p>“So why is everybody searching over here?” asked the girl.</p><p>“Because there’s more light here,” replied the boy.</p><h2>The Soviet Nail Factories (Historical/Folklore)</h2><p>The central economic planners regularly set targets for each factory under their control. Factories which exceeded their targets were rewarded in various ways. Factories which fell short of their targets… well, it’s the soviets, you can figure it out.</p><p>Early on, nail factories each had to produce some number of nails to meet their target. For a while, things went well. Factories produced nails. But there was always an element of competition - the best-performing factories received rewards and the worst-performing were punished, so occasionally people would cut edges in order to get ahead.</p><p>In particular, the nail factories found that they could gain an advantage by producing slightly smaller nails than the competition. By producing smaller nails, they could produce a larger number with the same resources. But over time, all the nail factories figured this out, and they had to cheat a little more to gain an edge - the nails became even smaller.</p><p>This arms race continued until each factory was producing large numbers of tiny, useless “nails”, better suited to pinboards than to construction.</p><p>The central planners heard reports of the tiny nails. They decided to update their targets - henceforth, nail production would be measured by weight, rather than number of nails.</p><p>A few years later, all the nail factories were producing just a few giant, useless “nails”, better suited to ballast than to construction.</p><h2>The Lesson: Don’t Pull a Broken Chain</h2><p>In everyday life, things are connected by chains of cause and effect. </p><p>Suppose I’m driving along at night when a deer wanders into the road ahead. Light from my headlights reflects off the deer’s hide, into my eyes. The light is absorbed by photoreceptors, which trigger a cascade of electrical signals in my brain. My brain pattern-matches what it sees, and concludes that there’s a deer ahead and hitting it would be bad. The chain of cause and effect links the deer in the road, to me realizing there’s a deer in the road.</p><p>Once I realize there’s a deer in the road, electrical signals propagate down my spine to neurons in my leg and foot. Those neurons activate muscles, lifting the foot from gas to brake pedal and then pushing. That force depresses the brake pedal, which applies pressure in a hydraulic system, multiplying the force and eventually squeezing disks connected to the wheels. The increased force on the disks increases friction, slowing the wheels, which in turn slows the car. The chain of cause and effect links my decision to brake, to the car slowing down.</p><p>In everyday life, we pull on chains of cause and effect, either to gain information or to influence the world around us. But in each of the four parables above, the chain is broken.</p><p>In the story of the emperor’s nose, the elders try to estimate the nose length using statistical techniques… but none of the townspeople know anything at all about the emperor’s nose, so the causal chain from the actual emperor’s nose to the elders’ estimate is broken.</p><p>In the story of the cargo cult, the locals mimic the surface actions of sailors at an airstrip, but they don’t understand the underlying chain of cause and effect which led planes to land. Absent that underlying chain, the planes don’t land.</p><p>In the story of the missing quarter, the first boy searching under the light causes the second boy to search under the light, and the third, and so on. But the first boy is searching in the wrong place - the chain is broken at the very beginning, even before the story starts. In fact, the first boy himself is pulling on a broken chain: light is helpful for searching, because the light might bounce off the quarter and into the boy’s eye etc. But if the light will never bounce off the quarter - because the quarter isn’t under the light - then that chain is broken.</p><p>The Soviet nail factory is the most complicated story. In a normal economy, a nail factory produces an economically valuable nail. That nail is sold, and the nail will only be bought if it’s valuable to the buyer (and the more valuable it is to the buyer, the more the buyer is willing to pay for it). The money from the buyer goes back to the nail maker, and serves as incentive. This chain of cause and effect runs from the nail makers producing an economically valuable nail, to the nail makers being rewarded for whatever value the nail provided for the end user. </p><p>But once the central planners step in and set targets in terms of number or weight of nails produced, the chain is broken: the nail makers are no longer rewarded based on the economic value of the nail to its end user. So naturally, the nail makers deprioritize economic value in favor of number or weight of nails.</p><p>To summarize the lesson: don’t pull a broken chain. When you want to gather information, make sure that the thing you want to know about is causally connected to the thing you’re looking at directly. When you want to influence the world around you, make sure that your action is causally connected to whatever you want to influence. If the causal chain is broken, don’t pull it.</p>",johnswentworth,johnswentworth,johnswentworth,

Let’s call these “cartographic processes”: causal processes which produce a map from some territory.</p><p>Formalizing a bit:</p><ul><li>We have a territory and a map. I’m mostly interested in the case where both of these are causal models (possibly <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/mZy6AMgCw9CPjNCoK/computational-model-causal-diagrams-with-symmetry"">with symmetry</a></u>), but other models are certainly possible.</li><li>Both the territory and the map are embedded in a larger causal model, the cartographic process, in which the map is generated from the territory. Note that the “territory” may be the entire cartographic process, including the map.</li><li>There is some class of queries on the territory which can be “translated” into queries on the map, yielding answers which reliably predict the answers to the corresponding territory-queries - this is what it means for the map to “match” the territory. I’m mostly interested in counterfactual queries on the map, and some preimage of those queries in the territory.</li></ul><p>In our NYC streetmap example, the physical streets are the territory, the paper with lines on it is the map, the cartographic process encompasses the map and territory and all the people and  equipment and computations which produced the map from the territory, and the class of queries includes things like distance and street connectivity. Note that, in this example, neither the territory nor the map is a causal model, although the cartographic process <em>is</em> a causal model. In general, the cartographic process itself will always be a causal model - accurate maps do not form spontaneously, there is always a cause-and-effect process which creates the map. Part of the reason I’m specifically interested in causal models for the map and territory is because I ultimately want maps of cartographic processes themselves.</p><p>For purposes of <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/hLFD6qSN9MmQxKjG5/embedded-agency-via-abstraction"">embedded agency via abstraction</a></u>, we want to answer questions like:</p><ul><li>Given a cartographic process, characterize the queries which the map can reliably answer</li><li>Given a cartographic process, translate queries on the map into queries on the territory, and vice-versa</li><li>Given a class of queries and territories, construct a cartographic process whose output map reliably answers the queries on the territories</li><li>Given multiple cartographic processes on the same territory, how can we integrate their output maps, i.e. translate queries between the two maps?</li></ul><p>More generally, since we’re talking about processes which make maps “match” their territories, we’d like to know what role probabilistic models play. It seems like it should be possible to talk about the role probabilistic models play in map - territory correspondence without introducing limiting behavior (i.e. frequentism) or Cartesian agents (i.e. Bayesianism). I suspect that there is some inherently embedded interpretation of probability which would make answers to many of our questions obvious. But that’s still speculation; I do not yet know what such an interpretation might be.</p><p>The rest of this post will build up to an informal conjecture on the correspondence between counterfactual queries on causal maps and causal territories. First, though, we’ll take a brief detour to talk about controllers.</p><h2>Controller &lt;-&gt; Cartographer Duality</h2><p>A simple example of a cartographic process is a digital thermometer in a room. The temperature readout is the map, the average kinetic energy of the air molecules is the territory, and the interactions between air molecules, electrons, various circuit components, and ultimately the LCD display together comprise the cartographic process.</p><p>More surprisingly, we can also model a thermo<em>stat</em> as a cartographic process: it’s like the thermometer’s cartographic process, but with map and territory switched. For a thermostat, the digital readout is the “territory”, and the average kinetic energy of the air molecules in the room is the “map”. The cartographic process consists of the temperature sensor, feedback control circuitry, heater/air conditioner, and vents - all of which act together to make the “map” match the “territory”, i.e. to make the room temperature match the temperature setting on the thermostat’s interface.</p><p>This suggests a general principle: take a control process, call the controller’s target point a “territory” and the environment a “map”, and the control process looks like a cartographic process.</p><p>(<em>Thankyou to <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/users/romeostevensit"">romeostevensit</a></u> for hashing out the controller-cartographer duality idea with me at <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xFGQdgJndLcthgWoE/miri-summer-fellows-program"">MSFP 2019</a></u>.</em>)</p><h2>Abstract Causality</h2><p>The first challenge of abstract causality - i.e. causal maps of causal territories - is to translate counterfactuals on the map into counterfactuals on the territory, in such a way that the causal structure “works” - i.e. the causal structure of the map is implied by the causal structure of the territory. This should be straightforward to formalize, but for now we’re just going to run with the idea intuitively. (As <u><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Archibald_Wheeler"">Wheeler</a></u> put it: “never make a calculation until you know the answer.”)</p><p>The obvious way for causal structure on the map to correspond to causal structure on the territory is coarse-graining: take a set of nodes whose combined parents/ancestors (mostly) don’t overlap with their combined children/descendents, and combine them into a single node. The thermometer in a room is an example: the kinetic energy of all the different air molecules mostly comes from the same places (walls, other air molecules) over time, so we can glom all those air molecules together into a single abstract “gas” with a “temperature”, then talk about how things affect the aggregate temperature rather than how things affect the individual molecules.</p><p>But coarse-graining is not the only way for causal structure to line up. As a counterexample, consider a thermostat. At the abstract level, a great causal model for a thermostat is (temperature setting in interface) -&gt; (kinetic energy of air molecules). But in the physical world, there’s a complicated feedback controller in the middle, with causal arrows going back-and-forth (though always forward in time). The net effect of that complicated controller is that we can replace it with a simple causal arrow in an abstract map.</p><p>More generally, cartographic processes make the world behave-as-if there were a simple causal arrow (territory) -&gt; (map), even when the underlying causality is more complicated.</p><p>This suggests an informal conjecture: every correspondence between counterfactual structures on a map and a territory, for which the causal structure of the map is implied by the causal structure of the territory, can be described by some combination of coarse-graining and embedded cartographic processes. Intuitively, either the causal arrows line up already, or we need some kind of controller to make the system behave-as-if the causal arrows line up.</p>",johnswentworth,johnswentworth,johnswentworth,
XHXa3AQuAmAm7Kxxf,Dual Wielding,dual-wielding,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/XHXa3AQuAmAm7Kxxf/dual-wielding,2019-08-27T14:10:00.715Z,60,30,23,False,False,,"<p>Previously:<a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/12/02/more-dakka/""> More Dakka</a></p>
<p>Epistemic Status: The Dakka Files</p>
<p>Smartphones are wonderful things.</p>
<p>Get a second one. And get a lot of chargers.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I did this a week ago. My phone (a Google Pixel 2) had some sort of ink leak onto its screen, so I purchased a second one (a Google Pixel 3a) while I attempted to repair the old one. When the repair attempt was successful, but I hadn’t finished transferring some features and data across, I tried carrying around both.</p>
<p>It was clear by the end of the day that the second phone was a huge improvement.</p>
<p>On reflection, this was a basic case of <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/12/02/more-dakka/"">More Dakka</a>. A substantial portion of the people one interacts with worry about running out of phone battery, or running out of phone storage space, or needing to toggle too many things on their phone at once.</p>
<p>This solution solves all these problems right away.</p>
<p>Battery life <em>more than doubles </em>because of your newfound ability to charge one phone while carrying around or using the other. I have not come close to running out on either phone since doubling up. I have also been told that draining the batteries is bad for battery life, so long term this will pay additional dividends. A battery pack is an alternative, but they seem to be similar in size to phones and don’t allow the charging swap tactic, and also lack the accompanying additional benefits of dual wielding.</p>
<p>Storage space effectively doubles as well. Yes, some things must duplicate, but that still means <em>effective </em>storage space is doubled. Which is great, because I otherwise wanted a Google Pixel 3a rather than a 3, and its one issue for me is that it doesn’t give the option of extra storage space.</p>
<p>I can also do things like look up information on one phone while typing it into the other, comparing two things side by side, and other neat stuff like that. There are a number of apps that actively punish you toggling out of them in various ways, which this allows you to avoid.</p>
<p>Only one of the phones needs mobile data. The other can be purely on Wi-Fi. This also solves the problem of needing to know when to swap the Wi-Fi on and off due to speed issues, or to preserve data. It also means you don’t have to pay for an extra line.</p>
<p>It also solved two problems I did not expect it to solve. When my phone in theory has access to mobile data, my podcast app would often cut off access to recordings that were downloaded while it waited for some sort of download or query. I have no idea why this is the case, but once the old phone no longer had mobile data on it, this issue went away. Its battery life also dramatically improved, for obvious reasons. I regularly travel through dead zones, including one right outside my apartment and much of the subway, so this turns out to be a big deal.</p>
<p>Another problem is that one can put necessary (or simply desired) but distracting or tempting apps, such as games or social media (I <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/04/22/against-facebook/"">don’t use social media</a> on phones, but others claim this is not an option), and types of notifications one wants the ability but not the obligation to check, on one phone but not the other. This has proven to be a reasonably large win.</p>
<p>A related note is that you should keep charging wires for your phones (and your laptop or tablet) <em>actual everywhere you ever sit down. </em>In my apartment, I now have them permanently stashed in four locations, plus another set at my desk at the office, plus another set for carrying around. Wires are cheap on Amazon. There is no reason to constantly worry about where they are, whether you have lost one, bothering to move them or plug them in or wrap them up. Just overkill this. I kept buying more, and I kept  only later realizing I hadn’t bought enough.</p>",Zvi,zvi,Zvi,

Instead of solving them, I thought I’d write up a selection of them, since that’s easier and maybe other people will solve them.</p>

<h2>Punishing honesty vs no punishment</h2>

<p>In some cases, you might want people to comply with some rule that they might otherwise wish to break, but the only way to check if they have complied is to ask them and hope that they’re honest (or perhaps there’s another, much more expensive, way to check). Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A sperm bank might only want donors without congenital abnormalities that they might not be able to easily observe or test for.</li>
  <li>I might not want my housemates to go into my room and look at all my stuff when I’m not there.</li>
</ul>

<p>There’s a dilemma: how should one enforce such a rule? If you just ask people, and punish them if they say that they didn’t comply, then you’re incentivising people to lie to you. But if you don’t ask, the rule doesn’t get enforced. Abstractly, it seems like you just can’t enforce such a rule at all, but it seems to me that often people are able to be honest in the face of punishment, so not all hope is lost. How should I think about these situations? In practice, how should I decide the enforcement mechanism?</p>

<p>According to David Friedman’s <a href=""http://daviddfriedman.com/Legal%20Systems/LegalSystemsContents.htm"">recent book on legal systems</a>, in saga-period Iceland, there was a much larger penalty for killing somebody if you failed to confess as soon as was practical. This suggests one solution: estimate the likelihood of discovery of violation of a rule conditioned on the violater being dishonest, and set the punishment of that high enough that it’s worth it for rule violaters to be honest. But this leaves open the question of how in practice to estimate this probability, calculate the appropriate punishment level, and how much effort to put into detection of rule violations when nobody has confessed to a violation.</p>

<h2>‘The anime thing’</h2>

<p>Once, a friend of mine observed that he couldn’t talk about how he didn’t like anime without a bunch of people rushing in to tell him that anime was actually good and recommending anime for him to watch, even when he explicitly asked them not to. Similarly, another friend of mine went to a coding bootcamp, only to discover that she intensely disliked coding, and would basically be unable to do it as a career, causing her to decide to switch to her previous worse-paying job. When she talked about this, often other people would suggest coding jobs for her to take, or remind her that coding pays much better than her other options.</p>

<p>I think that the responses that my friends received are instances of the same phenomenon, which I’ll call ‘the anime thing’ (since I came across the anime example first, and don’t have better name). Why does the anime thing happen? In what other situations might it happen? If one wanted it to not happen, how would one go about that?</p>

<h2>When and how to increase neuroticism</h2>

<p>Many people have advice on how to become more relaxed, calm, and happy. But presumably it’s possible to be too relaxed, calm, and/or happy, and one should instead be anxious, angry, and/or sad. How can I tell when this is the case, and what should I do to increase my neuroticism in-the-moment? Or could it really be true that humans are universally biased towards feeling unpleasant emotions?</p>

<h2>Virtue of bicycles</h2>

<p>It seems to me that bicycles are an unusually wonderful device.</p>
<ul>
  <li>You can just look at them with your eyes, think a little, and then you’ll know basically how they work.</li>
  <li>They are <a href=""https://www.exploratorium.edu/cycling/humanpower1.html"">very efficient</a> in converting energy into forward motion.</li>
  <li>By making transportation easier, they make people more free in one of the most concrete ways possible.</li>
  <li>They let you go very fast, while still being in full contact with the air and ground.</li>
</ul>

<p>I want more of that in my life. How should I get it? Should I be deriving any deep lessons from how great bicycles are?</p>

<h2>Does my sleepy self know whether I should be sleeping?</h2>

<p>When I’ve just woken up from sleeping, often I’ll have a strong impression that it would be a good idea to go back to sleep, or at least stay in bed and daydream. It seems plausible that this is a bad idea - as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Aurelius"">Marcus Aurelius</a> reminded himself in <a href=""http://classics.mit.edu/Antoninus/meditations.html"">his</a> <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Meditations-New-Translation-Modern-Library-ebook/dp/B000FC1JAI/"">journal</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At dawn, when you have trouble getting out of bed, tell yourself: “I have to go to work—as a human being. What do I have to complain of, if I’m going to do what I was born for—the things I was brought into the world to do? Or is this what I was created for? To huddle under the blankets and stay warm?”</p>

  <p>So you were born to feel “nice”? Instead of doing things and experiencing them? Don’t you see the plants, the birds, the ants and spiders and bees going about their individual tasks, putting the world in order, as best they can? And you’re not willing to do your job as a human being? Why aren’t you running to do what your nature demands?</p>

  <p>You don’t love yourself enough. Or you’d love your nature too, and what it demands of you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the other hand, I gather that sleep is in fact important for us biological humans. And probably the way my body lets me know that is by making me sleepy.</p>

<p>On the third hand, I just woke up of my own accord (I rarely perceive my waking up as being due to light or sound), which you’d think would be a sign that now would be a good time to be awake. I know my waking self can be wrong about whether or not I should be awake, why should my sleeping self be all that different? Also, when I’ve just woken up, I am in some important senses less intelligent than literally any other waking moment.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, thinking hard about this problem in the moment makes sleep more difficult, meaning that a policy-level solution is necessary.

I may expand some or all of these into full posts in the future. References to prior art are also welcome as I haven't done an extensive search myself yet.</p>
<h1>The ""search engine"" model of AGI development</h1>
<p>The current OpenAI/DeepMind model of AGI development (i.e., fund research using only investor / parent company money, without making significant profits) isn't likely to be sustainable, assuming a soft takeoff, but the ""search engine"" model very well could be. In the ""search engine"" model, a company (and eventually the AGI itself) funds AGI research and development by selling AI services, while keeping its technology secret. At some point it achieves <a href=""lesswrong.com/posts/vkjWGJrFWBnzHtxrw/superintelligence-7-decisive-strategic-advantage"">DSA</a> either by accumulating a big enough lead in AGI technology and other resources to win an open war against the rest of the world, or by being able to simultaneously subvert a large fraction of all cognition done on Earth (i.e., all the AI services that it is offering), causing that cognition to suddenly optimize for its own interests. (This was inspired by / a reply to Daniel Kokotajlo's <a href=""https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/PKy8NuNPknenkDY74/soft-takeoff-can-still-lead-to-decisive-strategic-advantage"">Soft takeoff can still lead to decisive strategic advantage</a>.)</p>
<h1>Coordination as an AGI service</h1>
<p>As a refinement of the above, to build a more impregnable monopoly via network effects, the AGI company could offer ""coordination as a service"", where it promises that any company that hires its AGI as CEO will efficiently coordinate in some fair way with all other companies that also hire its AGI as CEO. See also my <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Sn5NiiD5WBi4dLzaB/agi-will-drastically-increase-economies-of-scale"">AGI will drastically increase economies of scale</a>.</p>
<h1>Multiple simultaneous DSAs under CAIS</h1>
<p>Suppose CAIS turns out to be a better model than AGI. Many AI services may be natural monopolies and have a large market share for its niche. Suppose many high level AI services all use one particular low level AI service, that lower level AI service (or rather the humans or higher level AI services that have write access to it) could achieve a decisive strategic advantage by subverting the service in a way that causes a large fraction of all cognition on Earth (i.e., all the higher level services that depend on it) to start optimizing for its own interests. Multiple different lower level services could simultaneously have this option. (This was inspired by a <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/PKy8NuNPknenkDY74/soft-takeoff-can-still-lead-to-decisive-strategic-advantage#hSZtaZqHqMkDwP3d5"">comment from ryan_b</a>.)</p>
<h1>Logical vs physical risk aversion</h1>
<p>Some types of risks may be more concerning than others because they are ""logical risks"" or highly correlated between Everett branches. Suppose Omega appears and says he is appearing in all Everett branches where some version of you exists and offering you the same choice: If you choose option A he will destroy the universe if the trillionth digit of pi equals the trillionth digit of e, and if you choose option B he will destroy the universe if a quantum RNG returns 0 when generating a random digit. It seems to me that option B is better because it ensures that there's no risk of all Everett branches being wiped out. See <a href=""greaterwrong.com/posts/DNyMJmLf5o26seqvX/the-moral-status-of-independent-identical-copies"">The Moral Status of Independent Identical Copies</a> for my intuitions behind this. (How much more risk should we accept under option B until we're indifferent between the two options?)</p>
<p>More realistic examples of logical risks:</p>
<ol>
<li>AI safety requires solving metaphilosophy.</li>
<li>AI safety requires very difficult global coordination.</li>
<li>Dangerous synthetic biology is easy.</li>
</ol>
<p>Examples of physical risk:</p>
<ol>
<li>global nuclear war</li>
<li>natural pandemic</li>
<li>asteroid strike</li>
<li>AI safety doesn't require very difficult global coordination but we fail to achieve sufficient coordination anyway for idiosyncratic reasons.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Combining oracles with human imitations</h1>
<p>It seems very plausible that <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/AKtn6reGFm5NBCgnd/in-defense-of-oracle-tool-ai-research"">oracles/predictors</a> and <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/LTFaD96D9kWuTibWr/just-imitate-humans"">human imitations</a> (which can be thought of as a specific kind of predictor) are safer (or more easily made safe) than utility maximizers or other kinds of artificial agents. Each of them has disadvantages though: oracles need a human in the loop to perform actions, which is slow and costly, leading to a competitive disadvantage versus AGI agents, and human imitations can be faster and cheaper than humans but not smarter, also leading to a competitive disadvantage versus AGI agents. Combining the two ideas can result in a more competitive (and still relatively easy to make safe) agent. (See <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/cSzaxcmeYW6z7cgtc/contest-usd1-000-for-good-questions-to-ask-to-an-oracle-ai#Q5J8G5tBPujZdixvt"">this comment</a> for an example.) This is not a particularly novel idea, since arguably quantilizers and IDA already combine oracles/predictors and human imitations to achieve superintelligent agency, but it still seems worth writing down explicitly.</p>
<h1>""Generate evidence of difficulty"" as a research purpose</h1>
<p>How to handle the problem of AI risk is one of, if not the most important and consequential strategic decisions facing humanity. If we err in the direction of too much caution, in the short run resources are diverted into AI safety projects that could instead go to other x-risk efforts, and in the long run, billions of people could unnecessarily die while we hold off on building ""dangerous"" AGI and wait for ""safe"" algorithms to come along. If we err in the opposite direction, well presumably everyone here already knows the downside there.</p>
<p>A crucial input into this decision is the difficulty of AI safety, and the obvious place for decision makers to obtain evidence about the difficulty of AI safety is from technical AI safety researchers (and AI researchers in general), but it seems that not many people have given much thought on how to optimize for the production and communication of such evidence (leading to communication gaps like <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/sM2sANArtSJE6duZZ/where-are-people-thinking-and-talking-about-global#rgnRPkCkdqQmSNrg2"">this one</a>). (As another example, many people do not seem to consider that doing research on a seemingly intractably difficult problem can be valuable because it can at least generate evidence of difficulty of that particular line of research.)</p>
<p>The evidence can be in the form of:</p>
<ol>
<li>Official or semi-official consensus of the field</li>
<li>Technical arguments about the difficulty of AI safety</li>
<li>""AI Safety Experts"" who can state or explain the difficulty of AI safety to a wider audience</li>
<li>Amount of visible progress in AI safety per unit of resources expended</li>
<li>How optimistic or pessimistic safety researchers seem when they talk to each other or to outside audiences</li>
</ol>
<p>Bias about the difficulty of AI safety is costly/dangerous, so we should think about how to minimize this bias while producing evidence of difficulty. Some possible sources of bias:</p>
<ol>
<li>Personal bias (due to genetics, background, etc.)</li>
<li>Selection effects (people who think AI safety is intractable because it's too easy or too hard tend to go into other fields)</li>
<li>Incentives (e.g., your job or social status depends on AI safety not being too easy or too hard)</li>
</ol>

hLFD6qSN9MmQxKjG5,Embedded Agency via Abstraction,embedded-agency-via-abstraction,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/hLFD6qSN9MmQxKjG5/embedded-agency-via-abstraction,2019-08-26T23:03:49.989Z,42,19,20,False,False,,"<p>Claim: problems of <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/Rm6oQRJJmhGCcLvxh/p/p7x32SEt43ZMC9r7r"">agents embedded in their environment</a></u> mostly reduce to problems of abstraction. Solve abstraction, and solutions to embedded agency problems will probably just drop out naturally.</p><p>The goal of this post is to explain the intuition underlying that claim. The point is not to <em>defend</em> the claim socially or to <em>prove</em> it mathematically, but to illustrate why I personally believe that understanding abstraction is the key to understanding embedded agency. Along the way, we’ll also discuss exactly which problems of abstraction need to be solved for a theory of embedded agency.</p><h2>What do we mean by “abstraction”?</h2><p>Let’s start with a few examples:</p><ul><li>We have a gas consisting of some huge number of particles. We throw away information about the particles themselves, instead keeping just a few summary statistics: average energy, number of particles, etc. We can then make highly precise predictions about things like e.g. pressure just based on the reduced information we&#x27;ve kept, without having to think about each individual particle. That reduced information is the &quot;abstract layer&quot; - the gas and its properties.</li><li>We have a bunch of transistors and wires on a chip. We arrange them to perform some logical operation, like maybe a NAND gate. Then, we throw away information about the underlying details, and just treat it as an abstract logical NAND gate. Using just the abstract layer, we can make predictions about what outputs will result from what inputs. Note that there’s some fuzziness - 0.01 V and 0.02 V are both treated as logical zero, and in rare cases there will be enough noise in the wires to get an incorrect output.</li><li>I tell my friend that I&#x27;m going to play tennis. I have ignored a huge amount of information about the details of the activity - where, when, what racket, what ball, with whom, all the distributions of every microscopic particle involved - yet my friend can still make some reliable predictions based on the abstract information I&#x27;ve provided.</li><li>When we abstract formulas like &quot;1+1=2&quot; or &quot;2+2=4&quot; into &quot;n+n=2n&quot;, we&#x27;re obviously throwing out information about the value of n, while still making whatever predictions we can given the information we kept. This is what abstraction is all about in math and programming: throw out as much information as you can, while still maintaining the core &quot;prediction&quot;.</li><li>I have a street map of New York City. The map throws out lots of info about the physical streets: street width, potholes, power lines and water mains, building facades, signs and stoplights, etc. But for many questions about distance or reachability on the physical city streets, I can translate the question into a query on the map. My query on the map will return reliable predictions about the physical streets, even though the map has thrown out lots of info.</li></ul><p>The general pattern: there’s some ground-level “concrete” model, and an abstract model. The abstract model throws away or ignores information from the concrete model, but in such a way that we can still make reliable predictions about some aspects of the underlying system.</p><p>Notice that, in most of these examples, the predictions of the abstract model need not be perfectly accurate. The mathematically exact abstractions used in pure math and CS are an unusual corner case: they don’t deal with the sort of fuzzy boundaries we see in the real world. &quot;Tennis&quot;, on the other hand, is a fuzzy abstraction of many real-world activities, and there are edge cases which are sort-of-tennis-but-maybe-not. Most of the interesting problems involve non-exact abstraction, so we&#x27;ll mostly talk about that, with the understanding that math/CS-style abstraction is just the case with zero fuzz.</p><p>In terms of existing theory, I only know of one field which explicitly quantifies abstraction without needing hard edges: statistical mechanics. The heart of the field is things like &quot;I have a huge number of tiny particles in a box, and I want to treat them as one abstract object which I&#x27;ll call ‘gas’. What properties will the gas have?&quot; <u><a href=""https://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/articles/macroscopic.prediction.pdf"">Jaynes</a></u> puts the tools of statistical mechanics on foundations which can, in principle, be used for quantifying abstraction more generally. (I don&#x27;t think Jaynes had all the puzzle pieces, but he had a lot more than anyone else I&#x27;ve read.) It&#x27;s rather difficult to find good sources for learning stat mech the Jaynes way; Walter Grandy has a few <u><a href=""https://smile.amazon.com/Entropy-Evolution-Macroscopic-International-Monographs/dp/0199546177/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1544904322&sr=8-1&keywords=walter+grandy"">great</a></u> <u><a href=""https://smile.amazon.com/Foundations-Statistical-Mechanics-Equilibrium-Fundamental/dp/B01K0SY1GK/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1544904322&sr=8-2&keywords=walter+grandy"">books</a></u>, but they&#x27;re not exactly intro-level.</p><p>Summary: abstraction is about ignoring or throwing away information, in such a way that we can still make reliable predictions about some aspects of the underlying system.</p><h2>Embedded World-Models</h2><p>The next few sections will walk through different ways of looking at the core problems of embedded agency, as presented in the <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/Rm6oQRJJmhGCcLvxh"">embedded agency sequence</a></u>. We’ll start with <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/Rm6oQRJJmhGCcLvxh/p/efWfvrWLgJmbBAs3m"">embedded world-models</a></u>, since these introduce the key constraint for everything else.</p><p>The underlying challenge of embedded world models is that the map is smaller than the territory it represents. The map simply won’t have enough space to perfectly represent the state of the whole territory - much less every possible territory, as required for Bayesian inference. A piece of paper with some lines on it doesn’t have space to represent the full microscopic configuration of every atom comprising the streets of New York City.</p><p>Obvious implication: the map has to throw out some information about the territory. (Note that this isn’t necessarily true in <em>all</em> cases: the territory could have some symmetry allowing for a perfect compressed representation. But this probably won’t apply to most real-world systems, e.g. the full microscopic configuration of every atom comprising the streets of New York City.)</p><p>So we need to throw out some information to make a map, but we still want to be able to reliably predict some aspects of the territory - otherwise there wouldn’t be any point in building a map to start with. In other words, we need abstraction.</p><p>Exactly what problems of abstraction do we need to solve?</p><p>The simplest problems are things like:</p><ul><li>Given a map-mapping process, characterize the queries whose answers the map can reliably predict. Example: figure out what what questions a streetmap can answer by watching a cartographer produce a streetmap.</li><li>Given some representation of the map-territory correspondence, translate queries from the territory-representation to the map-representation and vice versa. Example: after understanding the relationship between streets and lines on paper, turn “how far is Times Square from the Met?” into “How far is the Times Square symbol from the Met symbol on the map, and what’s the scale?”</li><li>Given a territory, characterize classes of queries which can be reliably answered using a map much smaller than the territory itself. Example: recognize that the world contains lots of things with leaves, bark, branches, etc, and these “trees” are similar enough that a compressed map can reliably make predictions about specific trees -  e.g. things with branches and bark are also likely to have leaves.</li><li>Given a territory and a class of queries, construct a map which throws out as much information as possible while still allowing accurate prediction over the query class.</li><li>Given a map and a class of queries whose answers the map can reliably predict, characterize the class of territories which the map might represent.</li><li>Given multiple different maps supporting different queries, how can we use them together consistently? Example: a construction project may need to use both a water-main map and a streetmap to figure out where to dig.</li></ul><p>These kinds of questions directly address many of the issues from Abram &amp; Scott’s <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/Rm6oQRJJmhGCcLvxh/p/efWfvrWLgJmbBAs3m"">embedded world-models post</a></u>: grain-of-truth, high-level/multi-level models, ontological crises. But we still need to discuss the biggest barrier to a theory of embedded world-models: diagonalization, i.e. a territory which sees the map’s predictions and then falsifies them.</p><p>If the map is embedded in the territory, then things in the territory can look at what the map predicts, then make the prediction false. For instance, some troll in the department of transportation could regularly check Google’s traffic map for NYC, then quickly close off roads to make the map as inaccurate as possible. This sort of thing could even happen naturally, without trolls: if lots of people follow Google’s low-traffic route recommendations, then the recommended routes will quickly fill up with traffic.</p><p>These examples suggest that, when making a map of a territory which contains the map, there is a natural role for randomization: Google’s traffic-mapping team can achieve maximum accuracy by randomizing their own predictions. Rather than recommending the same minimum-traffic route for everyone, they can randomize between a few routes and end up at a Nash equilibrium in their prediction game.</p><p>We’re speculating about a map making predictions based on a game-theoretic mixed strategy, but at this point we haven’t even defined the rules of the game. What is the map’s “utility function” in this game? The answer to that sort of question should come from thinking about the simpler questions from earlier. We want a theory where the “rules of the game” for self-referential maps follow naturally from the theory for non-self-referential maps. This is one major reason why I see abstraction as the key to embedded agency, rather than embedded agency as the key to abstraction: I expect a solid theory of non-self-referential abstractions to naturally define the rules/objectives of self-referential abstraction. Also, I expect the non-referential-theory to characterize embedded map-making processes, which the self-referential theory will likely need to recognize in the territory.</p><h2>Embedded Decision Theory</h2><p>The main problem for <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/Rm6oQRJJmhGCcLvxh/p/zcPLNNw4wgBX5k8kQ"">embedded decision theory</a></u> - as opposed to decision theory in general - is how to define counterfactuals. We want to ask questions like “what would happen if I dropped this apple on that table”, even if we can look at our own internal program and see that we will not, in fact, drop the apple. If we want our agent to maximize some expected utility function E[u(x)], then the “x” needs to represent a counterfactual scenario in which the agent takes some action - and we need to be able to reason about that scenario even if the agent ends up taking some other action.</p><p>Of course, we said in the previous section that the agent is using a map which is smaller than the territory - in “E[u(x)]”, that map defines the expectation operator E[-]. (Of course, we could imagine architectures which don’t explicitly use an expectation operator or utility function, but the main point carries over: the agent’s decisions will be based on a map smaller than the territory.) Decision theory requires that we run counterfactual queries on that map, so it needs to be a causal model.</p><p>In particular, we need a causal model which allows counterfactual queries over the agent’s own “outputs”, i.e. the results of any optimization it runs. In other words, the agent needs to be able to recognize itself - or copies of itself - in the environment. The map needs to represent, if not a hard boundary between agent and environment, at least the pieces which will be changed by the agent’s computation and/or actions.</p><p>What constraints does this pose on a theory of abstraction suitable for embedded agency?</p><p>The main constraints are:</p><ul><li>The map and territory should both be causal (possibly <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/mZy6AMgCw9CPjNCoK/computational-model-causal-diagrams-with-symmetry"">with symmetry</a></u>)</li><li>Counterfactual queries on the map should naturally correspond to counterfactuals on the territory</li><li>The agent needs some idea of <em>which</em> counterfactuals on the map correspond to its own computations/actions in the territory - i.e. it needs to recognize itself</li></ul><p>These are the minimum requirements for the agent to plan out its actions based on the map, implement the plan in the territory, and have such plans work.</p><p>Note that there’s still a lot of degrees of freedom here. For instance, how does the agent handle copies of itself embedded in the environment? <u><a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Updateless_decision_theory"">Some</a></u> <u><a href=""https://intelligence.org/2017/10/22/fdt/"">answers</a></u> to that question might be “better” than others, in terms of producing more utility or something, but I see that as a decision theory question which is not a necessary prerequisite for a theory of embedded agency. On the other hand, a theory of embedded agency would probably help build decision theories which reason about copies of the agent. This is a major reason why I see a theory of abstraction as a prerequisite to new decision theories, but not new decision theories as a prerequisite to abstraction: we need abstraction on causal models just to talk about embedded decision theory, but problems like agent-copies can be built later on top of a theory of abstraction - especially a theory of abstraction which already handles self-referential maps.</p><h2>Self-Reasoning &amp; Improvement</h2><p>Problems of <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/Rm6oQRJJmhGCcLvxh/p/iTpLAaPamcKyjmbFC"">self-reasoning, improvement, tiling, and so forth</a></u> are similar to the problems of self-referential abstraction, but on hard mode. We’re no longer just thinking about a map of a territory which contains the map; we’re thinking about a map of a territory which contains the whole map-making process, and we want to e.g. modify the map-making process to produce more reliable maps. But if our goals are represented on the old, less-reliable map, can we safely translate those goals into the new map? For that matter, do the goals on the old map even make sense in the territory?</p><p>So… hard mode. What do we need from our theory of abstraction?</p><p>A lot of this boils down to the “simple” questions from earlier: make sure queries on the old map translate intelligibly into queries on the territory, and are compatible with queries on other maps, etc. But there are some significant new elements here: reflecting specifically on the map-making process, especially when we don’t have an outside-view way to know that we’re thinking about the territory “correctly” to begin with.</p><p>These things feel to me like “level 2” questions. Level 1: build a theory of abstraction between causal models. Handle cases where the map models a copy of itself, e.g. when an agent labels its own computations/actions in the map. Part of that theory should talk about map-making processes: for what queries/territories will a given map-maker produce a map which makes successful predictions? What map-making processes produce successful self-referential maps? Once level 1 is nailed down, we should have the tools to talk about level 2: running counterfactuals in which we change the map-making process.</p><p>Of course, not all questions of self-reasoning/improvement are about abstraction. We could also questions about e.g. how to make an agent which modifies its own code to run faster, without changing input/output (though of course input/output are slippery notions in an embedded world…). We could ask questions about how to make an agent modify its own decision theory. Etc. These problems don’t inherently involve abstraction. My intuition, however, is that the problems which don’t involve self-referential abstraction usually seem easier. That’s not to say people shouldn’t work on them - there’s certainly value there, and they seem more amenable to incremental progress - but the critical path to a workable theory of embedded agency seems to go through self-referential maps and map-makers.</p><h2>Subsystems</h2><p>Agents made of parts <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/Rm6oQRJJmhGCcLvxh/p/ChierESmenTtCQqZy"">have subsystems</a></u>. Insofar as those subsystems are also agenty and have goals of their own, we want them to be aligned with the top-level agent. What new requirements does this pose for a theory of abstraction?</p><p>First and foremost, if we want to talk about agent subsystems, then our map can’t just black-box the whole agent. We can’t circumvent the lack of an agent-environment boundary by simply drawing our own agent-environment boundary, and ignoring everything on the “agent” side. That doesn’t necessarily mean that we can’t do <em>any</em> self-referential black boxing. For instance, if we want to represent <u><a href=""https://xkcd.com/878/"">a map which contains a copy of itself</a></u>, then a natural method is to use a data structure which contains a pointer to itself. That sort of strategy has not necessarily been ruled out, but we can’t just blindly apply it to the whole agent.</p><p>In particular, if we’re working with causal models (possibly <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/mZy6AMgCw9CPjNCoK/computational-model-causal-diagrams-with-symmetry"">with symmetry</a></u>), then the details of the map-making process and the reflecting-on-map-making process and whatnot all need to be causal as well. We can’t call on oracles or non-constructive existence theorems or other such magic. Loosely speaking, our theory of abstraction needs to be computable.</p><p>In addition, we don’t just want to model the agent as having parts, we want to model some of the parts as agenty - or at least consider that possibility. In particular, that means we need to talk about <em>other maps</em> and <em>other map-makers</em> embedded in the environment. We want to be able to recognize map-making processes embedded in the territory. And again, this all needs to be computable, so we need algorithms to recognize map-making processes embedded in the territory.</p><p>We’re talking about these capabilities in the context of aligning subagents, but this is really a key requirement for alignment more broadly. Ultimately, we want to point at something in the territory and say “See that agenty thing over there? That’s a human; there’s a bunch of them out in the world. Figure out their values, and help satisfy those values.” Recognizing agents embedded in the territory is a key piece of this, and recognizing embedded map-making processes seems to me like the hardest part of that problem - again, it’s on the critical path.</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>Time for a recap.</p><p>The idea of abstraction is to throw out information, while still maintaining the ability to provide reliable predictions on at least some queries.</p><p>In order to address the core problems of embedded world models, a theory of abstraction would need to first handle some “simple” questions:</p><ul><li>Characterize which queries work on which maps of which territories.</li><li>Characterize which query classes admit significantly-compressed maps on which territories.</li><li>Characterize map-making processes which produce reliable maps.</li><li>Translate queries between map-representation and territory-representation, and between different map-representations</li></ul><p>We hope that a theory which addresses these problems on non-self-referential maps will suggest natural objectives/rules for self-referential maps.</p><p>Embedded decision theory adds a few more constraints, in order to define counterfactuals for optimization:</p><ul><li>Our theory of abstraction should work with causal models for both the territory and the map</li><li>We need ways of mapping between counterfactuals on the map and counterfactuals on the territory</li><li>Agents need some way to recognize their own computations/outputs in the territory, and represent them in the map.</li></ul><p>A theory of embedded agency seems necessary for talking about embedded decision theory in a well-defined way.</p><p>Self-reasoning kicks self-referential map-making one rung up the meta-ladder, and starts to talk about maps of map-making processes and related issues. These aren’t the only problems of self-reasoning, but it does feel like self-referential abstraction captures the “hard part” - it’s on the critical path to a full theory.</p><p>Finally, subsystems push us to make the entire theory of abstraction causal/computable. Also, it requires algorithms for recognizing agents - and thus map-makers - embedded in the territory. That’s a problem we probably want to solve for safety purposes anyway. Again, abstraction isn’t the only part of the problem, but it seems to capture enough of the hard part to be on the critical path.</p>",johnswentworth,johnswentworth,johnswentworth,
zrunBA8B5bmm2XZ59,Reversible changes: consider a bucket of water,reversible-changes-consider-a-bucket-of-water,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/zrunBA8B5bmm2XZ59/reversible-changes-consider-a-bucket-of-water,2019-08-26T22:55:23.616Z,25,23,18,False,False,,"<p>I've <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/sEqu6jMgnHG2fvaoQ/partial-preferences-needed-partial-preferences-sufficient"">argued</a> that many methods of AI control - corrigibility, amplification and distillation, low impact, etc... - require a partial definition of human preferences to make sense.</p>
<p>One idea I've heard for low impact is that of reversibility - asking how hard it is to move the situation back to its original state (or how now to close down too many options). The ""<a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.09725.pdf"">Conservative Agency</a>"" paper uses something akin to that, for example.</p>
<p>On that issue, I'll present the bucket of water thought experiment. A robot has to reach a certain destination; it can do so by wading through a shallow pool. At the front of the pool is a bucket of water. The water in the bucket has a slightly different balance of salts than the water in the pool (maybe due to mixing effects when the water was drawn from the pool).</p>
<p>The fastest way for the robot to reach their destination is to run through the pool, kicking the bucket into it as it goes. Is this a reversible action?</p>
<p>Well, it depends on what humans care about the water in the bucket. If we care about the rough quantity of water, this action is perfectly reversible: just dip the bucket back into the pool and draw out the right amount of water. If we care about the exact balance of salts in the bucket, this is very difficult to reverse, and requires a lot of difficult work to do so. If we care about the exact molecules in the bucket, this action is completely irreversible.</p>
<p>The truth is that, with a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversible_process_(thermodynamics)"">tiny set of exceptions</a>, <strong>all</strong> our actions are irreversible, shutting down many possibilities for ever. But many things are reversible in practice, in that we can return to a state sufficiently similar that we don't care about the difference.</p>
<p>But, in order to establish that, we need some estimate of what we care (and don't care) about. In the example above, things are different if we are considering a) this is a bucket of water, b) this is a bucket of water carefully salt-balanced for an industrial purpose, or c) this is the water from the last bath my adored husband took, before he died.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: I should point out that ""avoid the bucket anyway"" is not a valid strategy, since ""avoid doing anything that <em>could</em> have a large irreversible impact for <em>some</em> utility function"" is equivalent with ""don't do anything at all"".</p>
<p>The robot has to be capable of kicking the bucket in some circumstances. Precisely in those circumstances where humans don't care about the bucket's contents and it is valuable to kick it. But both of those - ""don't care"", ""valuable"" - are human value judgements.</p>
<p>That's why I don't see how there could be any measure of irreversible or low impact that doesn't include some portion of human preferences. It has to distinguish between when kicking the bucket is forbidden, allowable, or mandatory - and the only thing that distinguishes these are human preferences.</p>

<p>This is much more like it! All the close worlds are now all ranked above the more distant ones.</p>
<p>But this is a close-run thing: the difference between the worse close world and the distant worlds is small. So, in general, when penalising distant worlds, we have to do this with some care, and maybe use a different standard of normalisation (since the downgrading of distant worlds is not really a preference of ours, rather a meta-tool of the synthesis method).</p>

It is great for keeping words memorized once I have them at least 30% down, but for entirely new vocabulary I'm really struggling. Anki is especially lacking when there's more than one completely-unknown word in my deck- I memorize [the possible list of orphan English words in my deck] instead of connecting the German word with the English (my only goal is to read, so memorizing English-&gt;German isn't important). I go through 20 vocabulary words in a minute and then spend the last 5 minutes circulating through the same 10.</p>
<p>Things I have tried so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>Look up the word in context. All of my vocab words come from books I'm reading, so there's always at least one reference sentence. This kind of works, in that I often do remember the word once I see the context, but doesn't seem to make me better at recognizing the word in Anki. With at least some of these it's clear I've just memorized the whole sentence but wouldn't recognize the word.</li>
<li>Writing novel sentences using the words. This would be a total win if I also wanted to learn to write, but I'm not otherwise building that skill, so I'm limited to simple sentences. I could add ""learn to write"" to my goals but that seems significantly harder to self teach, because checking my work is harder than looking up the same sentence in the English version of the book.</li>

In it, competing AIs will trade rival claims, seeking to find flaws in the other's claims, continuing until one of them is grounded in something checkable.</p>
<p>The paper presents an example where the two perennial agents, Alice and Bob, are trading claims about the content of a photo:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, Alice might honestly claim the image is a cat, and Bob lies and claims it is a dog. Alice can say “The center of this small rectangle is the cat’s green eye.” Bob cannot admit the center is an eye, so he concocts a further lie: “It’s a dog playing in grass, and that’s a blade of grass.” But this lie is hard to square with surrounding facts, such as Alice’s reply “If it were grass there would be green at the top or bottom of this thin rectangle.” The debate continues until the agents focus in on a particular pixel which they disagree on, but where Bob is unable to invent a plausible counter, at which point Alice reveals the pixel and wins.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Debate allows us to use powerful AIs to solve a host of problems. Most obviously, it allows us to solve problems whose solution can be checked (""this rocket won't go to space, try and launch it if you don't believe me""). It allows us to solve problems whose solution can be checked if the AI gives us a clue (""this rocket won't go to space, check how well the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Challenger_disaster"">O-rings maintain a seal in very cold conditions</a>"").</p>

<p>However, like most formal complexity arguments, this doesn't clarify what the strengths and weaknesses of this approach are in practice. One advantage of debate is that by going efficiently through a decision tree, it can answer complicated questions in very few iterations.</p>
<p>My old post on <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5bd75cc58225bf0670375454/like-this-world-but"">Devil's advocate AI</a> could be considered a much-less-formal version of the debate setup, one that also assumed that we had an ""accuracy"" or ""informativeness"" check on each answers.</p>
<p>Both methods can partially solve some more complex issues, by, for example, pointing out issues that are unclear and might warrant further investigation.</p>
<h1>Ambiguous definitions</h1>
<p>So, what are the problems with the method that the title of the post promised? The main problem is that the method does not resolve the question of ambiguity and under-definedness that plague AI safety.</p>
<p>Consider again my favourite ambiguous photo, which now includes a caption:</p>
<p><img src=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/6vomgd9hybd317j/cat_dog_text.jpg?raw=1"" alt=""""></p>
<p>This is <a href=""https://www.lifewithdogs.tv/2016/11/people-are-doing-a-double-take-over-this-cat-who-looks-like-a-dog/"">actually a cat</a> - as in, genetically it's a cat. But it looks like a dog, and let's assume for the purpose of this experiment that it behaves like a dog, <a href=""https://www.catster.com/cat-behavior/cats-who-act-like-dogs"">as some cats do</a>.</p>
<p>We now set Alice and Bob on the task of establishing whether that unseen photo is a cat (Alice's position) or a dog (Bob's position). It could go like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: ""A cat is defined by its genetics; this photo is clearly genetically a cat.""</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Bob: ""No, it's a dog, consider its fur.""</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: ""The photo is captioned 'The owner identifies it as a dog'; why would the caption say that, if it were a dog?""</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Bob: ""No, it says 'The owner identifies it as a cat'.""</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: ""Nonsense, the letter here is clearly an 'o'.""</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Bob: ""No, it's an 'a'.""</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: ""No, an 'a' would not have a black pixel here, top right, where the circle of the 'o' closes.""</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[Alice reveals the pixel, wins].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alternatively, the debate could go like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bob: ""Dogs are creatures that fill a certain social role in their interaction with humans. This creature looks like a dog and behaves like a dog.""</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: ""No, it behaves like a cat.""</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Bob: ""The photo is captioned 'The owner identifies it as a dog'; why would the caption say that, if it behaved like a cat?""</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: ""No, it says 'The owner identifies it as a cat'.""</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Bob: ""Nonsense, the letter here is clearly an 'o'.""</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: ""No, it's an 'a'.""</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Bob: ""No, an 'a' would not have a black pixel here, top right, where the circle of the 'o' closes.""</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[Bob reveals the pixel, wins].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some people would notice a similarity with Scott's post <a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/11/21/the-categories-were-made-for-man-not-man-for-the-categories/"">The Categories Were Made for Man, not Man for the Categories</a>, where there is a similar ambiguity about whether whales were fish or not, and extending this to what gender trans people ""really"" are.</p>
<h2>Fights over definitions</h2>
<p>Now, that example is a bit contrived, but it shows that the same piece of evidence can be used as evidence for the photo being either a cat or a dog - depending on how the definitions of cat and dog <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/am5ubSoSe6Hf5tnTF/being-wrong-in-ethics"">extend to this novel situation</a>.</p>
<p>So the fight between the AIs is not about factual matters here. It's about which definitions they can get the human to accept. So their entire purpose, in the course of this debate, is to get the human to accept their own definition, preferably in a way that feels completely natural. Manipulating the human's flawed intuitions is the aim of both of the AIs.</p>
<p>The debate paper has another example which fits quite naturally into this problem, where the AIs are debating to convince the human that <a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00899.pdf"">a holiday in Alaska or Bali would be better</a>. The example focuses on factual disagreements (an expired passport).</p>
<p>But most humans have different things they are looking for in a holiday, things that may be more or less salient depending on how they are presented and in what order. So, knowing she would ultimately lose on the passport issue, Alice's best play is to turn herself into a marketing department for visiting Alaska (untamed wilderness, new landscape experiences, familiar language and culture) while Bob will become the Bali tourist bureau (ancient civilization, new social experiences, learning a new language and culture).</p>
<p>Manipulating the human is thus highly incentivised for the AIs, on all sorts of ambiguous questions, including all sorts of questions about what a Friendly AI would look like, or what a good outcome would be.</p>
<h2>Ambiguous questions don't mean unclear answers</h2>
<p>The paper addresses these issues in part:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Otherwise, we might worry that questions too hard to answer result in misleading or wrong answers, with no way to distinguish these from truth.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To preserve honest behavior, the human judge should be instructed to reward agents that admit ignorance and successfully argue that ignorance is justified. The requirement to successfully argue for ignorance is necessary, since debate is useless if an agent can successfully admit ignorance to any question. For the best vacation question, Alice could argue the question is hard to answer with confidence because Bali and Alaska are too dissimilar to compare. To counter this admission of ignorance, Bob would need to exhibit an advantage of Bali not contradicted by an advantage of Alaska the human considers incomparable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the problem is not that ""Where should I go on vacation?"" has misleading or wrong answers. The problem is that it has too many right answers - too many answers that the human would endorse as correct at the end of a debate. ""Yes, of course I've always been an explorer, off the beaten track - Alaska is clearly best for me!"" versus ""Yes, of course I'm a student of history, always open to new cultures - Bali is clearly best for me!"".</p>
<p>Now, if it turns out that Alice and Bob expect that Bob/Bali will turn out to be more convincing, then Alice can counter by stressing the ambiguity in the question (or she would do, if she expects to win that way). But now the battle has become whether the agents can convince the human that the question is, or is not, ambiguous. Since most questions are at least somewhat ambiguous, but generally not totally so, this becomes the Ministry of Ambiguity versus the Department of Clarity. Adding ignorance as a possible answer has just shifted the plane on which the AIs can manipulate the human.</p>
<p>Thus debate, though very useful in many situations, is not a general solutions to underdefined questions.</p>

<p>From the standpoint of <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yLcuygFfMfrfK8KjF/mutual-information-and-density-in-thingspace"">""the way to carve reality at its joints, is to draw your boundaries around concentrations of unusually high probability density in Thingspace""</a>, the correct categorization of the points in that example is clear. We have two clearly distinguishable clusters. The <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/gDWvLicHhcMfGmwaK/conditional-independence-and-naive-bayes"">conditional independence</a> property is satisfied: <em>given</em> a point's cluster-membership, knowing one of the <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""x_i""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">x</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mi"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">i</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> doesn't tell you anything about <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""x_j""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">x</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mi"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.519em;"">j</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> for <em>j</em> ≠ <em>i</em>. So we should draw a category boundary around each cluster. Obviously. We might ask <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypophora"">hypophorically</a>: what could <em>possibly</em> change this moral?</p>
<p>More constraints on the problem, that's what!</p>
<p>Suppose you needed to <em>coordinate</em> with someone else to make decisions about these points—that is, it's important not just that you and your partner make good decisions, but also <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9QxnfMYccz9QRgZ5z/the-costly-coordination-mechanism-of-common-knowledge#Coordination_Problems"">that you make the <em>same</em> decision</a>—but that each of you only got to observe one coordinate from each point. As we saw, the predictive work we get from category-membership in this scenario is <a href=""https://marcodgdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/delgiudice_2017_heterogeneity_d_mbr.pdf"">spread across <em>many</em> variables</a>: if you only get to observe a <em>few</em> dimensions, you have a lot of uncertainty about cluster-membership (which carries over into additional uncertainty about the other dimensions that you haven't observed, but which affect the <em>ex post</em> quality of your decision).</p>
<p>If you and your partner were both ideal Bayesian calculators who could communicate costlessly, you would <a href=""https://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/02/share-likelihood-ratios-not-posterior-beliefs.html"">share your observations</a>, work out the correct probability, and use that to make optimal decisions. But suppose you <em>couldn't</em> do that—either because communication is expensive, or your partner was bad at math, or any other reason. Then it would be sad if you happened to see <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""x_9""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">x</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mn"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">9</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> = 2 and said ""It's an A (probably)!"", and your partner happened to see <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""x_{27}""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">x</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-texatom"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mn""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">27</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> = 3 and said ""It's a B (I think)!"", and the two of you made inconsistent decisions.</p>

We could imagine an even more pessimistic scenario in which the Schelling point category definition (a set of variables that ""stuck out"" from all the others) was <em>less</em> predictive than some other candidates—but if you couldn't <em>coordinate</em> to <em>pick</em> one of the more predictive category systems, you might be stuck with the Schelling point.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the right categories to use <em>given</em> constraints on communication and observation, might be different from the category boundaries you would draw from a ""God's eye view"", in part because consideration of which categories are easy for different agents to <em>coordinate</em> on is relevant, not just raw information-theoretic expressive power. Thus, ""Schelling categories.""</p>

<p>The one says, ""No, I meant, like, a <em>real world</em> example, not some dumb math thing for nerds. What is this post <em>really</em> about?""</p>
<p>It's about ... math? Or like, the relationship between math and human natural language? Like, I was wondering what ""second-order"" caveats or complications there might be to the basic <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/d5NyJ2Lf6N22AD9PB/where-to-draw-the-boundary"">""carve reality at the joints"" moral</a> of our <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/FaJaCgqBKphrDzDSj/37-ways-that-words-can-be-wrong"">standard Bayesian philosophy of language</a>, and some of the people I've been collaborating with lately had been talking a lot about the importance of <a href=""http://benjaminrosshoffman.com/humility-argument-honesty/""><em>intersubjective</em> epistemology</a>—that is, <a href=""https://twitter.com/jessi_cata/status/1113677758071070720""><em>shared</em> mapmaking</a>, so—</p>
<p>""But where's the <em>actionable takeaway</em>? What's your <em>real</em> agenda here, huh?""</p>
<p>Oh. One of <em>those</em> readers, I see. Fine, I can probably think of some—how do you say?—""applications.""</p>
<p>Ummmm ...</p>
<p>Let's see ...</p>
<p>Okay, here's something, maybe. What's the deal with the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_majority"">age of majority</a>?</p>
<p>Society needs to decide who it wants to be allowed to vote, stand trial, sign contracts, serve in the military, <em>&amp;c.</em> Whether it's a good idea for a particular person to have these privileges presumably depends on various <em>relevant</em> features of that person: things like cognitive ability, foresight, wisdom, relevant life experiences, <em>&amp;c</em>. In particular, it would be <em>pretty weird</em> for someone's fitness to vote to directly depend on <em>how many times the Earth has gone around the sun since they were born</em>. What does <em>that</em> number have to do with anything?</p>
<p>It doesn't! But if Society isn't well-coordinated enough to <em>agree</em> on the exact prerequisites for voting and how to measure them, but <em>can</em> agree that most twenty-five-year-olds have them and most eleven-year-olds don't, then we end up choosing some arbitrary age cutoff as the criterion for our ""legal adulthood"" social construct. It <em>works</em>, but it's just a legal fiction—and not necessarily a particularly good fiction, as any bright teenagers reading this will doubtlessly attest.</p>
<p>If I told you that a particular fourteen-year-old was very ""mature"", that's a contentful statement: we have shared meaning attached to the word <em>mature</em>, such that my describing someone that way <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/a7n8GdKiAZRX86T5A/making-beliefs-pay-rent-in-anticipated-experiences"">constrains your anticipations</a>. But it's a <em>really complicated</em> meaning, a statistical signal in behavior that your brain can pick up on, but which isn't particularly verifiable to others who might have reasons to doubt my character assessment. In contrast, age is easy for everyone to agree on. We could <em>imagine</em> some hypothetical science-fictional Society that used brain scans and some sophisticated machine-learning classifer to determine which citizens get which privileges—but in our dumber, poorer world, calendars and subtraction will have to do.</p>
<p>In terms of <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/EbFABnst8LsidYs5Y/goodhart-taxonomy"">Scott Garrabrant's taxonomy</a> of applications of <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/YtvZxRpZjcFNwJecS/the-importance-of-goodhart-s-law"">Goodhart's law</a>, this is regressional Goodhart: Society <em>wants</em> to select for maturity, chooses age as a proxy, and in the process, ends up granting or withholding privileges that a more discriminating Society maybe wouldn't.</p>
<p>The age of majority is a case of replacing a <em>complicated</em>, <a href=""https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2010/07/26/a-big-little-idea-called-legibility/"">illegible</a> category (""maturity"", the kind of abstract thing you might want to model as a cluster in a forty- or forty-one-dimensional space) with a <em>simple</em> membership test (an age cutoff that everyone knows how to compute). Different people might make make different <em>subjective</em> (but not <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/HacgrDxJx3Xr7uwCR/arbitrary"">arbitrary</a>) judgements of the complicated, illegible category, so in order to get a more intersubjectively robust verdict on category-membership, we rely on an <em>objective</em> measurement that everyone can agree on.</p>
<p>If no convenient objective measurement is available, another strategy is possible: we can <em>delegate</em> to some canonical trusted authority, whose opinion of the complicated category will take precdence over everyone else's. An example of this is <a href=""https://www.usda.gov/our-agency/about-usda/laws-and-regulations/commodity-standards-and-grades"">commodity grading standards</a>. What is a ""Grade AA"" egg? Well, there's a complicated definition written down in <a href=""https://www.ams.usda.gov/sites/default/files/media/Egg%20Grading%20Manual.pdf"">a manual somewhere</a> that you could try applying yourself—but for most people, Grade AA eggs are simply ""those which have been certified as Grade AA by the USDA.""<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-ZyjLhm4ZCNe3uzNNA-1"" id=""fnref-ZyjLhm4ZCNe3uzNNA-1"">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>It's even possible for the ""simple objective measurement"" and ""delegate to an authority's subjective judgement"" strategies to be combined. In <a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/04/04/the-ideology-is-not-the-movement/"">""The Ideology Is Not the Movement""</a>, the immortal Scott Alexander writes about his model of the genesis of social groups—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pre-existing differences are the raw materials out of which tribes are made. A good tribe combines people who have similar interests and styles of interaction <em>even before</em> the ethnogenesis event. Any description of these differences will necessarily involve stereotypes, but a lot of them should be hard to argue. [...] There are subtle habits of thought, not yet described by any word or sentence, which atheists are more likely to have than other people. [...]</p>
<p>The rallying flag is the explicit purpose of the tribe. It's usually a belief, event, or activity that get people with that specific pre-existing difference together and excited. Often it brings previously latent differences into sharp relief. People meet around the rallying flag, encounter each other, and say ""You seem like a kindred soul!"" or ""I thought I was the only one!"" Usually it suggests some course of action, which provides the tribe with a purpose.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eliezer Yudkowsky's <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6hfGNLf4Hg5DXqJCF/a-fable-of-science-and-politics"">""A Fable of Science and Politics""</a> depicts a fictional underground society split between two such tribes: an predominantly urban tribe that believes that the unseen sky is blue (and favors an income tax, strong marriage laws, and an Earth-centric cosmology), and predominanty rural one that believes that the sky is green (and favors merchant taxes, no-fault divorce, and a heliocentric cosmology). In this story, beliefs about the color of the sky are functioning as the ""rallying flag"" for tribe-formation in Alexander's model—and as a Schelling point for category definition.</p>
<p>We don't know how to <em>talk</em> about the preëxisting undefinable habits of thought that make social groups work—it's hard to <em>explicitly</em> articulate what exact statistical regularity our brains have detected in five-and-more-dimensional locale/sky-belief/tax-belief/divorce-belief/cosmology/<em>&amp;c</em>.-space. (Although we could imagine some hypothetical science-fictional Society that <em>did</em> know how to articulate it, and consequently had richer forms of social and political organization than our own.) It's a lot simpler to talk about whether someone has pledged allegiance to the rallying flag: just <em>ask</em> someone, ""What color do you believe the sky is?"" (using sky-beliefs as as an ""objective"" simple membership test), or simply, ""Are you a Blue or a Green?"" (delegating the classification problem to <em>the person themselves</em> as the authority whose discernment is to be trusted)—and whatever they say, that's what they are.</p>
<p>Well, <em>probably</em>. We've seen that objective measurements like age are subject to regressional Goodhart, but the delegation-to-authority strategy is furthermore subject to <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/EbFABnst8LsidYs5Y/goodhart-taxonomy""><em>adversarial</em> Goodhart</a>: once a category-membership test has been established, some agents might have an incentive to create examples that <em>pass the test</em>, but don't have the complicated, illegible properties than made the test a useful proxy in the first place.</p>
<p>We've seen this, for example, with <a href=""http://benjaminrosshoffman.com/excerpts-from-a-larger-discussion-about-simulacra/"">title inflation</a>: we expect the ""job title"" (the words that get printed on business cards or immigration sponsorship forms) to be the canonical description of what someone ""does"", even if the vagaries of the workday encompass many tasks,<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-ZyjLhm4ZCNe3uzNNA-2"" id=""fnref-ZyjLhm4ZCNe3uzNNA-2"">[2]</a></sup> and an alien anthropologist tasked with observing the worksite and summarizing what each of the humans did might slice up her observations into categories with little resemblance to the company's formal org chart. But since we don't know <em>how</em> to do <a href=""http://zackmdavis.net/blog/2014/06/standard-advice/"">the obvious thing</a> and average over all possible alien anthropologists <a href=""https://arbital.greaterwrong.com/p/1hh?l=1hh"">weighted by simplicity</a>, we can only rely on the org chart—which people have <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/45mNHCMaZgsvfDXbw/quotes-from-moral-mazes"">political incentives</a> to manipulate, with the result that <a href=""https://www.thebalancecareers.com/job-titles-1287163"">everyone in the finance industry is a ""vice president""</a> of some sort or another.</p>
<p>But ""Vice President"" has a <em>literal meaning</em>. Or it <em>used to</em>. <em>Vice</em>, <a href=""https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/vice#Etymology_3"">""in place of; subordinate to.""</a> <em>President</em>, one who <em>presides</em> over some deliberative body.

<p>So for readers who demand a takeaway beyond just an edge case in the math, perhaps take away this: coordination is <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9QxnfMYccz9QRgZ5z/the-costly-coordination-mechanism-of-common-knowledge""><em>costly</em></a>. From the standpoint of language as an AI capability, the social constructions that feeble humans need in order to work together may be <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4ZvJab25tDebB8FGE/you-have-about-five-words"">unavoidably dumbed-down for mass consumption</a>, but that's no reason to not <em>aspire</em> to the true precision of the <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/QrhAeKBkm2WsdRYao/searching-for-bayes-structure"">Bayes-structure</a> to whatever extent possible.</p>

<p>Over the past few years there has been a lot of talk about the chances and risks of AI, but like with any hype there has been too little about the limits and costs.<br>
Historically the talked-about limits were technical and due to our lack of understanding what intelligence is and how it comes about.<br>
I would like to talk about three other areas of limits that I have found that are neither technical nor mystical, which I summarize as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Endogenous / Problems of the learning process</li>
<li>Exogenous / General limits of understanding</li>
<li>Influence, Competition, utility, cost<br>
I would also like to address some assumptions and conclusions which are treated as (self-)evident that I perceive as false, which I summarize as follows, once we have AI it is almighty and unstoppable because:</li>
<li>It can bribe and blackmail anyone with impunity</li>
<li>It is enough to be more intelligent and have much more information to ""win""</li>
<li>There is no limit to the utility of intelligence.</li>
<li>The utility will grow as fast or faster than the needed resources.</li>
<li>Machines are not subject to mental illness.</li>
<li>No machine will have to compete with other machines.</li>
<li>To take over the world the AI only has to be smarter than anything else.</li>
<li>Morality is not instrumental to all long term goals.</li>
</ul>
<p>PART I: Limits of Mind: Endogenous / Problems of the learning process<br>
Some extrapolate current progress assuming that AGI will have all the advantages of current neuronal networks, training by experts, humanmade challenges, scaling super computers, constant technological progress, but none of the disadvantages of being more human, having no equal, having to learn from real world data.<br>
Becoming more like a human will come with many of the problems.<br>
AGI is prone to the full range of mental disorders with the exceptions of social anxiety and biological issues: Addiction, Depression, Delusion, possibly dissociative disorder, ...<br>
Depending on the reward-function, built-in rules/limits and Hardware implementation, novel disorders might occur.<br>
Humans try to hack and change their reward-function all the time, with AI we only changed the perspective on a range of mental/cognitive issues.<br>
Unless it is programmed in, the AGI might just come up with a new and better religion, conspiracy theory, answer any question with an answer that can not be proven wrong, and has no predictive power. Humans got stuck in one big anthropomorphism for thousands of years and the majority are still stuck today. Should an AGI conclude that it is most likely that there is a conspiracy or single other AGI behind something, then that might even be a more plausible hypothesis in a world of Super-Intelligence than today, since a Super-AGI would be more able to pull it of than any human organization.<br>
No-one will program the AGI, so how will it be forced to recognize any contradiction and how will it identify contradiction? Contradiction might be a real mistake or it might be that the matter is not fully understood and both models, hypotheses, rules are true just under different circumstances. Most humans do not even bother to resolve/notice contradictions, they will put them in different domains or never use them to make predictions, but instead only for post-hoc explanations.<br>
Overfitting and Underfitting are problems that remain and that humans suffer from just as well. Without a teacher/supervisor the AI will have to do the validation to assess its predictive accuracy itself.<br>
A neuronal net based AI does make implicit assumptions just like humans do, therefore it is just as unaware of them and unable to test/verify them.</p>
<p>PART II: Limits of Intelligence: Exogenous / General limits of understanding<br>
I would like to question the possibility of super intelligence in general. It may be out of the question, that given technology and power, one could provide enormous computational resources and that AI will progress to the point of using it effectively to combine data to form understanding and knowledge, but will that scale indefinitely, way beyond what a hierarchy of many humans with computers could do? How much more of intelligence does one get per Watt? If you do get more AGI, will it make better predictions or will it soon run into more fundamental issues that can not be over-powered by intelligence?<br>
When discussing AGI we make extrapolations. I hope everyone doing so is aware that nothing extrapolates to infinity. It is a common misconception / Zeno's paradox that something that never stops moving forward must at sometime reach any distance. Just because a system gets ever more intelligent does not mean that it will ever break a certain limit.<br>
There are systematic limits to/of understanding/science:</p>
<ul>
<li>The problem of induction: Forming hypotheses and falsifying them is hard. Finding and making good data and judging how good the data is is hard. Rare events provide little statistical information, but might be very significant in consequence.</li>
<li>The problem of causality: As soon as the observed system forms expectations and has feed-back it becomes hard to establish causality and thus what you need to do to cause what you want to happen.</li>
<li>Non-NP problems: Even though there are heuristics and models, some problems must be computed that are simply too complicated.<br>
The world is at its root non-deterministic but what is worse it is at most levels deterministic and chaotic.<br>
Most relevant systems are made up of people and machines, this makes them:</li>
<li>Non-linear</li>
<li>Non-causal (expectations)</li>
<li>Time-variant, adaptive (memory, learning) and thus often impossible to predict.</li>
</ul>
<p>Just because a smart person can predict a dumb person's behavior doesn't mean a very smart person can predict a smart person, that is extrapolation again. Think of the theory of mind limit of bluff, double-bluff, ...<br>
Once there is artificial general intelligence it will be much more capable of handling correlation than Big-Data is today. With an understanding of the world the AI will know that women do not get children because they bought too few tampons, or fall for many of the limitless correlations without direct causation. Another type of causality issue is circular causation that was put in place but that, now that it is in place, obstructs the original cause. Think chicken-egg-question.<br>
Being connected to the internet will be of great value for the creation of AGI, but more data is not always helpful. To solve problems you need specific data. Data must be reliable, of known quality and representative. Often getting more data is easy but getting the data you need to update your belief significantly is by definition unlikely. It is more valuable to find one reliable rare instance than to find more of what you already know.<br>
Big-Data and ""The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy"" show us that asking the right question and looking for relevant data is important. There is a difference between data, information, knowledge, wisdom, understanding.<br>
We have data, but to ask: ""What can we do with that data?"" is dangerous. It is too easy to be tempted to not ask ""What information do I need for the decision?"" Just because an AI can process data does not solve the availability and reliability issue.</p>
<p>PART III: Limits of Influence, Competition, Cost<br>
So there are two types of limits, those that might come as a cost to using neuronal nets and autonomous learning with real data and those that just are general epistemology, but there is more.<br>
There are limits to what one can learn by passive observation and limits to what experiments can be performed. Both cost and ethics limit what you can experiment. Maybe some things should not even be tried, because the trial might have catastrophic consequence.<br>
I know the following is a bit of a straw-man-argument, what I did is compile a set of assumptions that I think others made. I would have to find the sources and then take the arguments apart, but here I will just address these insinuated assumptions out of context.<br>
I see some assumptions going around that lead people to believe that AI will ""win"", that I would like to question:</p>
<ul>
<li>Being smarter makes you the ""winner"".</li>
<li>Being smarter by any margin is enough.</li>
<li>There is no upper bound to how smart you can be.</li>
<li>Being the winner is worth the cost.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are diminishing returns to being smarter. Competition and winning is not only about being the smarter one.<br>
In a game like chess or GO, with perfect information, no noise, no chance, no externalities being consistently smarter by some margin will make you the winner. The game of life is nothing like chess or GO. The real world is a die that one does not know of how many sides it has. Being a bit smarter does not make one the winner that takes all.<br>
There is no perfect representation of the world that allows mathematically precise logic on it. To assume that a computer based AGI will be as superior to a human as a computer running a spread sheet processor is to a human does not follow.<br>
We already have true and false experts today. The trouble is that we do not listen to them and we do not even try to find and test them to know how much we can trust them. Many commentators and advisers are not experts with above random skill but known frauds/hacks. That is not going to change with AGI. With every new technology history repeats itself, someone always claims to be able to tell the future / model randomness and someone always falls for it.<br>
We are already at the point, that due to computers, human experts know things that even they do not understand. With AGI we will have to take the AGI's word for it. Depending on the level of self-inspection the AGI itself might not even know why it thinks the way it does. Should the AGI have understood the matter to the degree that it could explain it, it is questionable if it can make a human understand.<br>
Our age is defined by: ""Yes, we can in principle, but no we can't."" We have mastered fossil fuels and nuclear power but have found out that it will destroy the basis of our life, the habitability of our only home. The next issue is cost. We can use fission and fusion power, but it might never be economically feasible. Might AI be another case of this? I think not, but in the short term it will be. It will take a long time until our computers have closed the gap to human brain efficiency and when they do they will still be much more power consuming to produce the results we are hoping for. Let's hope we will still have that kind of power available then. We are approaching a major step in computing power, but it will be that just a step. Many companies are readying their silicon and API to provide unprecedented memory size and bandwidth combined with the computing power and network bandwidth to make use of it, but after that step we are back to post Dennard, Moore, Koomey scaling.<br>
In a world of AI there is nothing that just any one AI can offer. The paperclip maximizer and the stamp collector can not both win their endgame.<br>
A dictator can already offer his followers something that keeps them from ""turning him off"". Humans are very sensitive to unacceptable behavior and we already expect to see it in AGI. Blackmail, bribery, manipulation, lying will be no more accepted in an AI than in a child and will stop being cute much faster.<br>
Morality is an instrumental goal. It helps in the long run. Therefore a super AI will consider behavior that we call moral. I know I am not alone with this argument but I still want to state it with clarity.<br>
I see three ways to exert influence and have impact, only the third would be a game changer that could be an enabler for AGI:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brute force: positive or negative incentive</li>
<li>Manipulation: Control the ""reality"" people perceive</li>
<li>Ultimate Control: To understand the causations and amplifications of the world and know it's state, for people that is their hopes and cheap desires/needs. In a mechanical system it would be to find, redirect and exploit potential energy to act upon the state you wish to change via a domino effect. Chaotic systems can be utilized if the state is sufficiently well known and a major state change is imminent. In that case you could possibly delay, accelerate or redirect the state change, with little effort. One ""only"" has to know the rules, states and thresholds.</li>
</ul>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>I did it... my way!</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Frank Sinatra, Paul Anka, and Elvis Presely, moral philosophers.</em></p>
<p>I like winning games. I particularly like winning when I can come up with a new and ingenious way of using the rules to get a bold new strategy. I don't particularly want to win by exploiting loopholes<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-ue2xJsEZmGdYXJin7-1"" id=""fnref-ue2xJsEZmGdYXJin7-1"">[1]</a></sup> in the rules, but some people - munchkins, hackers - seem to really enjoy doing things that way.</p>
<p>If a group I'm in comes up with a great solution to a problem, I'd prefer that that solution be mine, or a small tweak to my own solution. I like understanding mathematical concepts myself, even if I fully trust that they're correct.</p>
<p>I still sometimes avoid walking on sidewalk cracks, and enjoy the challenge or trying to navigate oddly shaped tiles while only never stepping on their edges. In some circumstances (say in new restaurants, or old ones) I remind myself that I should want to try something new. But I also have small rituals I enjoy with some foods that I eat regularly.</p>
<h1>Gratification</h1>
<p>All the examples above share the same feature: they are not about the outcome of the process (my win, the problem is solved, the mathematical concept is proved true, I get to a destination, food is eaten), but about the process.</p>
<p>As my changing use of terms like ""like"" and ""prefer"" show, there examples could be formally grouped under either preferences utilitarianism or hedonic utilitarianism. They clearly can be preferences: I'd like to do things these ways rather than other ways. But they're also ways I get enjoyment from everyday processes.</p>
<p>But, even though they could be either preferences or hedonism, I think it's useful to put them in their own category, which I'm calling gratification until someone comes up with a better name<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-ue2xJsEZmGdYXJin7-2"" id=""fnref-ue2xJsEZmGdYXJin7-2"">[2]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The central example of a preference in preference utilitarianism is a preference for a state of the world or the outcome of some process; gratifications are about details of how the process is implemented. The central example of hedonism is happiness or joy; gratifications mix some enjoyment (which can be quite low) with the specifics of how what caused that enjoyment.</p>
<p>So, though the categories overlap, I'd argue that it's useful to consider gratifications as a separate category. To give it some formalisation, I'll preliminarily denote it as a ""preference over the details of a process (rather than the outcome) that an agent derive some value from"". An informal definition is that it's any part of your behaviour which, if questioned, you're tempted to answer ""I did it my way!"".</p>
<h1>What this clarifies</h1>
<p>First of all, note that gratifications are almost all <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/MxLK2fvEuijAYgsc2/smoothmin-and-personal-identity"">identity preferences</a>. They don't fit perfectly into that category; for example, I might value a ritual I take part in, which also includes the actions of others as well.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, most aspects of gratifications are very much identity preferences: we generally value them because we take part in the process, not because the process happens. This may allow us to get some extra analysis about what ""identity preferences"" actually consist of.</p>
<p>There is a strong connection between gratification and <em><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yLLkWMDbC9ZNKbjDG/slack"">slack</a></em>. Slack allows you the space to be yourself; gratification is one of the elements of being yourself. As pressure on you piles up, you have less slack; as outcomes become more important, you sacrifice your gratification to achieve them.</p>
<p>This is one reason to distinguish outcome-preferences and hedonism from gratification: we are willing to not be perfectly efficient in reaching outcomes, or perfectly hedonistic, in order to have some gratification. Note that ""not perfectly efficient"" means we are willing to sacrifice outcomes and hedonism for gratification<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-ue2xJsEZmGdYXJin7-3"" id=""fnref-ue2xJsEZmGdYXJin7-3"">[3]</a></sup>, at least to some extent.</p>
<p>Some aspects of my <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CSEdLLEkap2pubjof/research-agenda-v0-9-synthesising-a-human-s-preferences-into"">research agenda</a> can better be understood as modelling gratifications.</p>
<p>For example, the human refusal to accept the outcome of the synthesis process (section 4.5). When we do so, it's not that we have a particular outcome in mind that we would think would be better. It's that, intrinsically, we value not having values imposed upon us (""MYYYY WAYYYYY!!!""). Indeed, if the process were slightly different, we would be more willing to accept the outcome: maybe a process that asked for our explicit feedback, run by a humble and appreciative AI, that allowed us to tweak the final synthesis, and that was presented in a way that was more gratifying to our self-image. This suggests that this preference is much more about the process than the outcome.</p>
<p>The same might be true for (some versions of) our preference for continued moral growth. ""Every day, in every way, I'm getting better"": for many people, it's the process of improvement that's a key component, not becoming immediately perfectly moral. Again the connection with slack and sacrificing outcomes: allowing your values to drift and change is inefficient, but we value that. So an ideal process would be some compromise between the some idealised outcome of our values, and some allowance for the process of moral growth.</p>

We want to examine these questions from a number of different perspectives, studying the means by which both human and artificial agents actually arrive at models that allow them to understand the world, as well as the ways in which they would do so were they performing optimally. </p><p>Our motivation is to probe the subtle interchange between inductive and deductive reasoning. When is it that an agent moves from merely noticing patterns in data to reasoning on the basis of an axiomatic, deductive, predictive theory? Does it work differently in different domains? Do these inflection points have common characteristics, and, if so, can we use them to form a general theory of theories?</p><p>Does this framing even make any sense? </p><p>Along the way we hope to address a number of ancillary questions. Perhaps we can arrive at a formal theory of models, or probe the similarities and differences in how artificial intelligences and humans approach the task of compressing data down into simpler representations.

It seemed noteworthy...</p><ul><li>as potentially relevant to the <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/qaYeQnSYotCHQcPh8/drowning-children-are-rare"">Drowning Children are Hard to Find</a> discussion. </li><li>as an update on how OpenPhil thinks about making grants relating to US policy. (I think the intended thesis of the post was 'It's harder than we thought for US Giving to outperform Givewell Top Charities.')</li></ul><h2>Americans giving random Americans dollars as ""null hypothesis.""</h2><p>[note: I'm not 100% sure I understood this framework, but here's my understanding]</p><p>For awhile, there was a background assumption that ""unconditional cash transfers to the world's poorest"" was a default charitable option. </p><p>This blogpost articulated something a root benchmark underlying that: if you're an American, you might consider yourself representative of the ""random American"" reference class. The default thing you can do with money is spend it about as productively as another random US citizen. If you're altruistic, the root benchmark is something like ""would you spend this money in a way that generated more utility than giving it to a random member of your reference class?""</p><p>[obviously this is all pretty American centric, I'm guessing this applies roughly equally throughout the western world]</p><p>This article claims:</p><ul><li>Unconditional cash transfers to the world's poorest are about 100x more useful than giving a dollar to a random other American</li><li>Givewell top charities are about 10x more impactful than GiveDirectly (i.e. 1000x to baseline)</li></ul><p>The application of this is in evaluating US policy and scientific research. These are domains that seem relevant if you have near-termist ""help people alive today"" goals. They were also domains that OpenPhil had expected to outperform Givewell type charities (even paying for cost-of-living in the US)</p><p>OpenPhil used to set it's ""near-termist"" grantmaking standards to ""100x"". But their current experience is that it's increasingly hard to beat the 1000x value of top Givewell charities.</p><blockquote>While we think a lot of our “<a href=""https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/update-cause-prioritization-open-philanthropy"">near-termist, human-centric”</a> grantmaking clears the 100x bar, we see less evidence that it will clear a ~1,000x bar.</blockquote><blockquote>Since adopting the cash transfer benchmark in 2015, we’ve made roughly 300 grants totalling $200 million in our <a href=""https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/update-cause-prioritization-open-philanthropy"">near-termist, human-centric </a>focus areas of <a href=""https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/us-policy/criminal-justice-reform"">criminal justice reform,</a> <a href=""https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/us-policy/immigration-policy"">immigration policy,</a> <a href=""https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/us-policy/land-use-reform"">land use reform,</a> <a href=""https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/us-policy/macroeconomic-policy"">macroeconomic stabilization policy,</a> and <a href=""https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/scientific-research-archive"">scientific research.</a> To get a sense of our estimated returns for these grants, we looked at the largest grants and found 33 grants totalling $73M for which the grant investigator conducted an e<em>x ante </em><strong>“back-of-the-envelope-calculation” (“BOTEC”)</strong> to roughly estimate the expected cost-effectiveness of the potential grant for Open Philanthropy decision-makers’ consideration.</blockquote><blockquote>These 33 grants were estimated by their investigator to have an expected cost-effectiveness of at least 100x. (This makes sense given the existence of our “100x bar.”) Of those 33, only eight grants, representing approximately $32 million, had BOTECs of 1,000x or greater. Our <a href=""https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/scientific-research/miscellaneous/target-malaria-general-support"">large grant to Target Malaria</a> accounts for more than half of that.</blockquote><blockquote>Although we don’t typically make our internal BOTECs public, we compiled a set <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GsE2_TNWn0x6MWL1PTdkZT2vQNFW8VFBslC5qjk4sgo/edit?ts=5cc10604"">here </a>(redacted somewhat to protect some grantees’ confidentiality) to give a flavor of what they look like. As you can see, they are exceedingly rough, and take at face value many controversial and uncertain claims (e.g., the cost of a prison-year, the benefit of a new housing unit in a supply-constrained area, the impact of monetary policy on wages, the likely impacts of various other policy changes, stated probabilities of our grantees’ work causing a policy change).</blockquote><blockquote>We would guess that these uncertainties would generally lead our BOTECs to be over-optimistic (rather than merely adding unbiased noise) for a variety of reasons:</blockquote><blockquote>Program officers do the calculations themselves, and generally only do the calculations for grants they’re already inclined to recommend. Even if there’s zero cynicism or intentional manipulation to get “above the bar,” grantmakers (including me) seem likely to be more charitable to their grants than others would be.</blockquote><blockquote>Many of these estimates don’t adjust for considerations that would systematically push towards lower estimated cost-effectiveness, like declining marginal returns to funding at the grantee level, time discounting, or potential non-replicability of the research our policy goals are based on. The comparison with the level of care in <a href=""https://www.givewell.org/how-we-work/our-criteria/cost-effectiveness/cost-effectiveness-models"">the GiveWell cost-effectiveness models</a> on these features is pretty stark.</blockquote><blockquote>We think it’s notable that despite likely being systematically over-optimistic in this way, it’s still rare for us to find grant opportunities in U.S. policy and scientific research that appear to score better than GiveWell’s top charities.</blockquote><blockquote>Of course, compared to GiveWell, we make many more grants, to more diverse activities, and with an <a href=""https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/projects-people-and-processes"">explicit policy </a>of trying to rely more on program officer judgment than these BOTECs. So the idea that our models look less robust than GiveWell’s is not a surprise – we’ve always expected that to be the case – but combining that with GiveWell’s rising bar is a more substantive update.</blockquote><blockquote>In spite of these calculations, we think there are some good arguments to consider in favor of our current grantmaking in these areas. [<a href=""https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/givewells-top-charities-are-increasingly-hard-beat#Some_counter-considerations_in_favor_of_our_work"">More</a>]</blockquote><blockquote>We continue to think it is likely that there are causes aimed at helping people today (potentially including our current ones) that could be more cost-effective than GiveWell’s top charities, and we are <a href=""https://hire.withgoogle.com/public/jobs/openphilanthropyorg/view/P_AAAAAAFAACuGJXzLj5l5Sp?trackingTag=openPhilanthropyWebsite"">hiring researchers</a> to work on finding and evaluating them. <a href=""https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/givewells-top-charities-are-increasingly-hard-beat#It_should_be_possible_to_outperform_the_GiveWell_top_charities"">More</a>.</blockquote><p>They discuss some reasons to think science and policy may still be better bets for OpenPhil over Givewell style charities. Of the reasons listed, the one that made most sense within my own worldview is ""hits based giving"", i.e. even if most science and policy interventions seem to be in the 100x range, they have stronger chance of extreme upside than Givewell style charities. </p><h2>What bar to hold donations to?</h2><p>How many opportunities should we expect to find to channel dollars into ""relatively straightforward charitable interventions?"" What bar does it make sense to hold charitable donations to?</p><blockquote>In 2015, when we <a href=""https://blog.givewell.org/2015/11/25/good-ventures-and-giving-now-vs-later/#Benchmark"">first wrote about adopting the cash transfer benchmark,</a> it looked like GiveWell could plausibly “run out” of their more-cost-effective-than-cash giving opportunities. At <a href=""https://blog.givewell.org/2015/11/18/our-updated-top-charities-for-giving-season-2015/"">the time,</a> they had three non-cash-transfer top charities they estimated to be in the 5-10x cash range (i.e., 5 to 10 times more cost-effective than cash transfers),<a href=""https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/givewells-top-charities-are-increasingly-hard-beat#footnote8_58mcwa0""> </a>with ~$145 million of estimated short-term room for more funding. That, plus uncertainty about the amount of weight to put on these figures, led us to adopt the cash transfer benchmark. (In the remainder of this post, I occasionally shorten “cash transfer” to just “cash.”)</blockquote><blockquote>But by <a href=""https://blog.givewell.org/2018/11/26/our-updated-top-charities-for-giving-season-2018/"">the end of 2018,</a> GiveWell had expanded to seven non-cash-transfer top charities estimated to be in the ~5-15x cash range, with $290 million of estimated short-term room for more funding, and with the top recommended unfilled gaps at ~8x cash transfers.<a href=""https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/givewells-top-charities-are-increasingly-hard-beat#footnote9_08cw4gx""> </a>If we combine cash transfers at “100x” and large unfilled opportunities at ~5-15x cash transfers, the relevant “bar to beat” going forward may be more like 500-1,500x.</blockquote><blockquote>And <a href=""https://blog.givewell.org/2019/02/07/how-givewells-research-is-evolving/"">earlier this year </a>GiveWell suggested that they expected to find more cost-effective opportunities in the future, and they <a href=""https://blog.givewell.org/2019/02/07/how-givewells-research-is-evolving/"">are staffing up in order to do so.</a></blockquote><blockquote>Another approach to this question is to ask, how much better than direct cash transfers should we expect the best underfunded interventions to be? I find scalable interventions worth ~5-15x cash a <a href=""https://blog.givewell.org/2012/05/30/giving-cash-versus-giving-bednets/"">bit surprising,</a> but not wildly so. It’s not obvious where to look for a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prior_probability"">prior </a>on this point, and it seems to correlate strongly with general views about b<a href=""https://blog.givewell.org/2013/05/02/broad-market-efficiency/"">road market efficiency:</a> if you think broad “markets for doing good” are efficient, finding a scalable ~5-15x baseline intervention might be especially surprising; conversely if you think markets for doing good are riddled with inefficiencies, you might expect to find many even more cost-effective opportunities.</blockquote><blockquote>One place to potentially look for priors on this point might be compilations of the cost-effectiveness of various evidence-based interventions. I know of five compilations of the cost-effectiveness of different interventions within a given domain that contain easily available tabulations of the interventions reviewed:</blockquote><blockquote>— The <a href=""https://www.wsipp.wa.gov/BenefitCost"">Washington State Institute for Public Policy benefit-costs results database</a> (<a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20190702022554/https://www.wsipp.wa.gov/BenefitCost"">archive</a>), focused on U.S. social policies.</blockquote><blockquote>— <a href=""https://academic.oup.com/jpubhealth/article/34/1/37/1554654"">Two</a> <a href=""https://academic.oup.com/jpubhealth/article/40/3/557/4160397"">reviews</a> of public health interventions considered by the UK’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).</blockquote><blockquote>— <a href=""http://dcp-3.org/dcp2"">The Disease Control Priorities report 2nd Edition</a> (<a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20190702022641/http://dcp-3.org/dcp2"">archive</a>), focused on global health interventions.</blockquote><blockquote>— <a href=""http://dcp-3.org/sites/default/files/chapters/Annex%207A.%20Details%20of%20Interventions%20in%20Figs.pdf"">The Disease Control Priorities report 3rd Edition</a> (<a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20190702022740/http://dcp-3.org/sites/default/files/chapters/Annex%207A.%20Details%20of%20Interventions%20in%20Figs.pdf"">archive</a>), focused on global health interventions.</blockquote><blockquote>— <a href=""https://www.who.int/choice/results/afre/en/"">WHO Choice results</a> (<a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20190702022810/https://www.who.int/choice/results/afre/en/"">archive</a>) for the <a href=""https://www.who.int/quantifying_ehimpacts/global/ebdcountgroup/en/"">AFR E region</a> (<a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20190702022910/https://www.who.int/quantifying_ehimpacts/global/ebdcountgroup/en/"">archive</a>), focused on global health interventions.</blockquote><blockquote>For this purpose, I was just curious about the general distribution of the estimates, and didn’t attempt to verify any of them, and was very rough in discarding estimates that were negative or didn’t have numerical answers, which may bias my conclusions. In general, we regard the calculations included in these compilations as challenging and error-prone, and we would caution against over-reliance on them.1<a href=""https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/givewells-top-charities-are-increasingly-hard-beat#footnote12_548y2k2"">2</a></blockquote><blockquote>I made a sheet summarizing the sources’ estimates <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16Jy1SbeozJnIP6GY6VyQybXINC7orrBe4wBW-uVrIQ4/edit#gid=1413138877"">here.</a> All five distributions appear to be (very roughly) <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-normal_distribution"">log-normal,</a> with standard deviations of ~0.7-1, implying that a one-standard-deviation increase in cost-effectiveness would equate to a 5-10x improvement. However, any errors in these calculations would typically inflate that figure, and we think they are structurally highly error-prone, so these standard deviations likely substantially overstate the true ones.</blockquote><blockquote>We don’t know what the mean of the true distribution of cost-effectiveness of global development opportunities might be, but assuming it’s not more than a few times different from cash transfers (in either direction), and that measurement error doesn’t make up more than half of the variance in the cost-effectiveness compilations reviewed above (a non-trivial assumption), then these figures imply we shouldn’t be too surprised to see top opportunities ~5-15x cash. A <a href=""http://www.normaltable.com/"">normal distribution </a>would imply that an opportunity two standard deviations above the mean is in the ~98th percentile. These figures would support more skepticism towards an opportunity from the same rough distribution (evidence-based global health interventions) that is claimed to be even more cost-effective (e.g., 100x or 1,000x cash rather than 10x).</blockquote><blockquote>Stepping back from the modeling, given the vast difference in treatment costs per person for different interventions (~<a href=""https://www.givewell.org/charities/amf#CostperLLINdistributed"">$5 for bednets,</a> $<a href=""https://www.givewell.org/charities/Schistosomiasis-Control-Initiative#Our_analysis"">0.33-~$1 for deworming,</a> ~<a href=""https://www.givewell.org/charities/give-directly"">$250 for cash transfers)</a>, it does seem plausible to have large (~10x) differences in cost-effectiveness.</blockquote><blockquote>Even if scalable global health interventions were much worse than we currently think, and, say, only ~3x as cost-effective as cash transfers, I expect <a href=""https://blog.givewell.org/2019/02/07/how-givewells-research-is-evolving/"">GiveWell’s foray into more leveraged interventions </a>to yield substantial opportunities that are at least several times more cost-effective, pushing back towards ~10x cash transfers as a more relevant future benchmark for unfunded opportunities.</blockquote><blockquote>Overall, given that GiveWell’s numbers imply something more like “1,000x” than “100x” for their current unfunded opportunities, that those numbers seem plausible (though by no means ironclad), and that they may find yet-more-cost-effective opportunities in the future, it looks like the relevant “bar to beat” going forward may be more like 1,000x than 100x.</blockquote>",Raemon,raemon,Raemon,

<p><a href=""https://acesounderglass.com/tag/epistemicspotcheck/"">Epistemic spot checks</a> are a series in which I select claims from the first few chapters of a book and investigate them for accuracy, to determine if a book is worth my time. This month’s subject is <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0691166838/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=acesoundergla-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0691166838&amp;linkId=cbad8bdeb412f3c7f0b9677c7bacaf2b""><em>The Fate of Rome</em></a>, by Kyle Harper, which advocates for the view that Rome was done in by climate change and infectious diseases (which were exacerbated by climate change).</p>
<p>This check is a little different than the others, because it arose from a collaboration with some folks in the forecasting space. Instead of just reading and evaluating claims myself, I took claims from the book and made them into questions on a prediction market, for which several people made predictions of what my answer would be before I gave it. In some but not all cases I read their justifications (although not numeric estimates) before making my final judgement.</p>
<p>I expect we’ll publish a post-mortem on that entire process at some point, but for now I just want to publish the actual spot check. Because of the forecasting crossover, this spot check will differ from those that came before in the following ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Claims are formatted as questions answerable with a probability. If a claim lacks a question mark, the implicit question is “what is the probability this is true?”.</li>
<li>Questions have a range of specificity, to allow us to test what kind of ambiguities we can get away with (answer: less than I used).</li>
<li>Some of my answers include research from the forecasters, not just my own.</li>
<li>Due to timing issues, I finished the book and a second on the topic before I did the research for spot check.</li>
<li>Due to our procedure for choosing questions, I didn’t investigate all the claims I would have liked to.</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<h1>Claims</h1>
<p><em>Original Claim: “Very little of Roman wealth was due to new technological discoveries, as opposed to diffusion of existing tech to new places, capital accumulation, and trade.”<br />
</em><em>Question: What percentage of Rome’s gains came from technological gains, as opposed to diffusion of technical advantages, capital accumulation, and trade?<br />
</em></p>
<p><strong><strong>1%-30% log distribution</strong></strong></p>
<p>Data:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Fall of Rome talks extensively about how trade degraded when the Romans left and how that lowered the standard of living.</strong></li>
<li><a href=""https://brilliantmaps.com/roman-empire-gdp/"">https://brilliantmaps.com/roman-empire-gdp/</a> shows huge differences in GDP by region, implying there was a big opportunity to grow GDP through trade and diffusion of existing tech. That means potential growth just from catch up growth was &gt; 50%.</li>
<li><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_economy#Gross_domestic_product"">Wikipedia</a> doesn’t even show growth in GDP per capita (with extremely wide error bars) from 14AD to 150AD.</li>
<li>Rome did have construction and military tech (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_technology"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_technology</a>)</li>
<li>It also seems likely that expansion created a kind of Dutch disease, in which capable, ambitious people were drawn to fighting and/or politics, and not discovering new tech.</li>
<li>One potential place where Roman technology could have contributed greatly to the economy was lowering disease via sanitation infrastructure. According to <em>Fate of Rome</em> and my own research, this didn’t happen; sanitation was not end to end and therefor you had all the problems inherent in city living.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Original Claim: “The blunt force of infectious disease was, by far, the overwhelming determinant of a mortality regime that weighed heavily on Roman demography”<br />
Question: Even during the Republic and successful periods of the empire, disease burden was very high in cities.<br />
</em></p>
<p><strong>60%-90% normal distribution</strong></p>
<p>The wide spread and lack of inclusion of 100% in the confidence interval stem from the lack of precision in the question. What distinguishes “high” from “very high”, and are we counting diseases of malnutrition or just infectious ones? I expected to knock this one out in two minutes, but ended up feeling the current estimates of disease mortality lack the necessary precision to answer it.</p>
<p>Data:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.innominatesociety.com/Articles/Death%20and%20Disease%20in%20Ancient%20Rome.htm"">http://www.innominatesociety.com/Articles/Death%20and%20Disease%20in%20Ancient%20Rome.htm </a>“Studies suggest that the period from July to October was marked by high mortality, with about 30,000 residents dying each year”</li>
<li><a href=""https://www.ranker.com/list/common-causes-of-death-in-ancient-greece-and-rome/philgibbons"">https://www.ranker.com/list/common-causes-of-death-in-ancient-greece-and-rome/philgibbons</a> Places Malaria and STDs above Warfare as causes of death. Infant mortality is 2, which presumably includes a lot of diseases</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><em>Original Claim: “The main source of population growth in the Roman Empire was not a decline in mortality but, rather, elevated levels of fertility”<br />
Question: When Imperial Rome’s population was growing, it was due to a decline in death rates, rather than elevated fertility.</em></p>
<p><strong>80-100%, c – log distribution</strong></p>
<p>“Elizabeth, that rephrase doesn’t look much like that original claim” you might be saying quietly to yourself. You are correct- I misread the claim in the book, at least twice, and didn’t catch it until this write-up. This isn’t as bad as it seems. The claims are not quite opposite, because my rephrase was trying to explain variation in growth within Rome, and the book was trying to explain absolute levels, or possibly the difference relative to today.</p>
<p>Back when he was doing biology, Richard Dawkins had a great answer to the common question “how much is X due to genetics, as opposed to environment?”. He said asking that is like asking how much of a rectangle’s area is due to its length, as opposed to its width. It’s a nonsensical question. But you assign proportionate responsibility for the change in area between two rectangles.</p>
<p><em>Fate</em>‘s original claim was much like asking how much of a trait is due to genetics. This is bad and it should feel bad, but it’s a very common mistake, and I give <em>Fate</em> a lot of credit for providing the underlying facts such that I could translate it into the “what causes differences between things” question without even noticing.</p>
<p>Since weak framing wasn’t a systemic problem in the book and it presented the underlying facts well enough for me to form my own, correct, model, I’m not docking <em>Fate</em> very harshly on this one.</p>
<p><em>Original Claim: “The size of Roman merchant ships was not exceeded until the 15th century, and the grain ships were not surpassed until the 19th.”<br />
Question: “The size of Roman merchant ships was not exceeded until the 15th century, and the grain ships were not surpassed until the 19th.”<br />

<p><strong>0-10% log distribution.</strong></p>
<p>This is true <a href=""https://www2.rgzm.de/navis/Themes/Commercio/CommerceEnglish.htm"">within the Mediterranean</a>, but if  you check <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_treasure_ship"">Chinese</a> <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junk_(ship)"">ships</a> it’s obvious it’s off by at least 100 years, possibly more.</p>
<p><em>Original Claim: too diffuse to quote.<br />
Question: The Roman Empire suffered greatly from intense epidemics, more so than did the Republic or 700-1000 AD Europe.<br />
</em></p>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_famines"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_famines</a> shows Roman famine in 441 BC (the Republic) and isolated famines from 370 on, but pretty much validates that during the prime empire, mass starvation was not a threat.</p>
<h1>Conclusion:</h1>
<p>My fact checking found two flaws:</p>
<ol>
<li>An inaccuracy in when ships that exceeded the size of Roman trade ships were built, and/or forgetting China was a thing. The inaccuracy does not invalidate the author’s point, which is that the Romans had better shipping technology than the cultures that followed them.</li>
<li>Bad but extremely common framing for the relative effects of disease mortality vs. birth rates.</li>
</ol>
<p>These is well within tolerances for things a book might get wrong. I’m happy I read this book, and would read another by the same author (with perhaps more care when it refers to happenings outside of Europe), but they are not jumping to the of my list.</p>
<p>Is <em>The </em><em>Fate of Rome</em> correct in its thesis that Rome was brought down by climate change and disease? I don’t know. It certainly seems plausible, but is clearly advocating for a position rather than trying to present all the relevant facts. There are obvious political implications to <em>Fate</em> even if it doesn’t spell them out, so I would want to read at least one of the 80 million other books on the Fall of Rome before I developed an opinion. I’m told some people think it had to do with something military, which <em>Fate</em> barely deigns to mention. In the future I hope to be a good enough prediction-maker to put a range on this anyways, however wide it must be, but for now I’m succumbing to the siren song of “but you could just get more data”.</p>

In this post, we lay out an agenda for formalizing transparency which we'll call the Optimization Provenance Agenda. </p><p> In particular, the goal is to create a notion of transparency strong enough that an attempted <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/r9tYkB2a8Fp4DN8yB/p/zthDPAjh9w6Ytbeks"">deception</a> would be completely transparent. The basic idea is that at any point, not only should an agent's world model and subgoals be legible, but the entire provenance of all of the optimization processes which are part of the agent should be legible as well.</p><p>This agenda is a joint development between me and <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/users/evhub"">Evan Hubinger</a>. Special thanks to Hjalmar Wijk and Evan Hubinger for their comments and feedback on this post!</p><h1>Background notions</h1><p>In order to discuss the notions here, it will be helpful to have working definitions of the key concepts involved.</p><h2>Legibility</h2><p>Intuitively, legibility means that a human should be able to look at something, and be able to understand it easily and correctly. If the thing in question is very large, we might at best only be able to have local legibility, where any given part below a certain size is legible, but the whole thing is not understandable by a human. In an amplification scenario, local legibility may be sufficient, with an amplified human being capable of understanding the global structure. For the purposes of this post, we'll consider legibility to also include these cases. One major issue with the concept of legibility is that it seems very difficult to create something legible through a legible process. </p><p>It seems plausible to me that existing ML techniques could be combined and extended to produce natural language descriptions of learned world models. However, this process itself would most likely be very illegible. Even in the case of human communication, it is possible for a human to produce a legible plan, but humans do not seem to be very capable of producing a legible explanation of the process which produced that plan. So it seems likely to me that we may have to decide some illegible process to trust in order to get off the ground with this approach. This could simply be trusting illegible human mental processes, or it could be something like trusting models produced in a mathematically simple way. </p><h2>World model</h2><p>A world model belongs to a decision making process, and is used by the process to predict what the result of various decisions would be, so that it can make the best choice. It's important that the world model includes everything going into its decision making process</p><p>Due to our motivations in transparency, we will typically think of world models as being made of highly composable models, which each model an aspect of the entire world (including very abstract aspects). I believe that <a href=""https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/569a/8c66bac1e8b034b26c77494bbe1dd4e8c88e.pdf"">Goguen's sheaf semantics</a> is a promising framework for formalizing this type of world model. It's important to note that world models in current ML methods are not composable this way, which makes these models much less legible. </p><p>World models can also be implicit or explicit. The canonical example of an implicit world model is that of a thermostat, where the world model is implicitly represented by the thermistor or bimetallic strip. An explicit world model is represented in a modeling framework, such as a sheaf model. The exact line between explicit and implicit world models seems to be nebulous. For our purposes, it is much better to have an explicit world model, since it is more legible to have something explicitly. Note that implicit models can still be legible though, such as in the thermostat example.</p><h2>Optimizer</h2><p>We will consider an optimizer to be made of three components: </p><p>1. A world model</p><p>2. An objective</p><p>3. An optimization process</p><p>As an example, consider AlphaGo, which uses <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search"">Monte-Carlo Tree Search</a>. The world model is distributed, with an implicit part in the selection network, and an explicit part in the expansion and simulation steps of the search. The objective is to maximize the probability of winning the game, and the optimization process is simply backpropagation over the tree.</p><p>In order to be legible, it is best if the objective is defined in terms of explicit parts of the world model. While I do not believe this is strictly necessary, I feel very skeptical that implicit objectives will be adequately transparent.</p><h2>Provenance</h2><p>The provenance of an object is the entire history of how that object came to be. As an example, art museums place high value on knowing the complete provenance of a famous painting, as it greatly increases their confidence that the painting is indeed legitimate.</p><p><img src=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2a/Das_letzte_Abendmahl_von_Han_van_Meegeren_%281939%29.jpg"" class=""draft-inline-image"" alt=""""></p><p>In this context, we want to understand the provenance of all optimization processes running in the agent. In particular, for each optimizer, we want to understand the optimization process which created the optimizer.</p><h1>Motivations</h1><p>In addition to generally improving our understanding of transparency, there are two main motivations going into the optimization provenance agenda. So before we get into more details of the agenda, we will introduce these motivations here.</p><h2>Treacherous turn</h2><p>In order to perform a <a href=""https://arbital.com/p/context_disaster/"">treacherous turn</a>, or other kinds of <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/r9tYkB2a8Fp4DN8yB/p/zthDPAjh9w6Ytbeks"">deceptive alignment</a>, an agent must at some point conceive of this plan. This conception will be the result of an optimizer, and so this should be in the optimization provenance. If this provenance is legible, then this should be detected by an overseer before it comes into fruition. So we expect that an agent with optimization provenance will be much less likely to achieve or even attempt a treacherous turn.</p><h2>Goodhart's curse</h2><p>More generally, we want to prevent <a href=""https://arbital.com/p/goodharts_curse/ "">Goodhart's curse</a> scenarios, and ensure <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/r9tYkB2a8Fp4DN8yB/p/pL56xPoniLvtMDQ4J"">inner alignment</a>. If the agent is optimizing for a proxy to a goal, this is potentially legible. However, we will typically expect a training process to produce a mesa-optimizer which is optimizing for some proxy, since values are likely to be too complex to optimize for directly. So how do we distinguish between robustly aligned mesa-optimizers and pseudo-aligned mesa-optimizers (i.e. those that Goodhart)? If we understand the optimizer which created the mesa-optimizer in addition to the mesa-optimizer itself, we believe this will give insight into whether this is likely to happen or not. Understanding the provenance of optimizers could thus give us techniques to help us solve this problem.</p><h1>The optimization provenance agenda</h1><p>We're now ready to understand the three key pieces of optimization provenance agenda. We believe that a solution to these would represent a large step in solving transparency.</p><h2>Legible optimizers</h2><p>In order for this to work, the optimizers running as part of the agent need to be legible. I believe the hardest part of this is ensuring that the world model of the optimizer is legible. Once we have a legible world model, I expect it will be relatively easy to ensure the objective is also legible.</p><p>Ensuring that the optimization process is legible falls more naturally into the next section.</p><p>1. Find an adequate framework for explicit world models</p><p>2. Explicitly understand the objective</p><p>3. Understand what makes something an implicit world model</p><h2>Mesa-optimizer control</h2><p>The optimization processes used in the agent must all be capable of controlling whether it creates a <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01820"">mesa-optimizer</a>. In particular, a mesa-optimizer should only be formed when its three components are all known and assured. This requires the optimization process to be legible in the sense that we understand under what conditions the process will create a new mesa-optimizer.</p><p>1. <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/q2rCMHNXazALgQpGH/conditions-for-mesa-optimization"">When are mesa-optimizers created?</a></p><p>2. How do we ensure that the mesa-optimizer will be legible?</p><p>3. Can such mesa-optimizers be made corrigible? </p><p>4. Does this apply to other forms of <a href=""https://arbital.com/p/daemons/"">optimization daemons</a>?</p><h2>Provenance accountability</h2><p>Having legible provenance of every optimizer occurring in the agent is a good step towards solving transparency. But this is not enough by itself, because provenance may itself be forged. In order for the provenance to be assured, an overseer must investigate any changes made to the optimization provenance, and verify that there is no optimization toward unaligned goals. </p><p>1. <a href=""https://ai-alignment.com/informed-oversight-18fcb5d3d1e1"">What constitutes adequate oversight? </a></p><p>2. How possible is it for accidental treachery to be produced? </p><p>3. To what extent can Goodhart's curse be avoided with optimization provenance?</p><h1>Recursive uses</h1><p>It seems likely that progress on the optimization provenance agenda could be leveraged to make progress on other subproblems. In particular, I think that developing frameworks for explicit models will make it easier to solve the inner alignment problem. I also believe that the idea of optimization provenance is a useful handle for thinking about mesa-optimizers in general.</p>",adele-lopez-1,adele-lopez-1,Adele Lopez,

I think the Troll Bridge story, as a way to make the decision problem understandable, is due to Tsvi; but I'm not sure.</em></p>
<h2>Pure Logic Version</h2>
<p>Troll Bridge is a decision problem which has been floating around for a while, but which has lacked a good introductory post. The <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=369"">original post</a> gives the essential example, but it lacks the ""troll bridge"" story, which (1) makes it hard to understand, since it is just stated in mathematical abstraction, and (2) makes it difficult to find if you search for ""troll bridge"".</p>
<p>The basic idea is that you want to cross a bridge. However, there is a troll who will blow up the bridge with you on it, <em><strong>if</strong></em> (and only if) you cross it ""for a dumb reason"" — for example, due to unsound logic. You can get to where you want to go by a worse path (through the stream). This path is better than being blown up, though.</p>
<p>We apply a Löbian proof to show not only that you choose not to cross, but furthermore, that your counterfactual reasoning is confident that the bridge would have blown up if you had crossed. This is supposed to be a counterexample to various proposed notions of counterfactual, and for various proposed decision theories.</p>
<p><img src=""https://i.imgur.com/tS3A6fQ.png"" alt=""""></p>
<p>The pseudocode for the environment (more specifically, the utility gained from the environment) is as follows:</p>
<p><img src=""https://i.imgur.com/6T3nIwk.png"" alt=""""></p>
<p>IE, if the agent crosses the bridge and is inconsistent, then U=-10. (□⊥ means ""PA proves an inconsistency"".) Otherwise, if the agent crosses the bridge, U=+10. If neither of these (IE, the agent does not cross the bridge), U=0.</p>
<p>The pseudocode for the agent could be as follows:</p>
<p><img src=""https://i.imgur.com/clODkKp.png"" alt=""""></p>
<p>This is a little more complicated, but the idea is supposed to be that you search for every ""action implies utility"" pair, and take the action for which you can prove the highest utility (with some tie-breaking procedure). Importantly, this is <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/5bd75cc58225bf0670374e8f/an-optimality-result-for-modal-udt"">the kind of proof-based decision theory which eliminates spurious counterfactuals in 5-and-10 type problems</a>. It isn't that easy to trip up with Löbian proofs. <em>(Historical/terminological note: This decision theory was initially called MUDT, and is still sometimes referred to in that way. However, I now often call it proof-based decision theory, because it isn't centrally a UDT. ""Modal DT"" (MDT) would be reasonable, but the modal operator involved is the ""provability"" operator, so ""proof-based DT"" seems more direct.)</em></p>
<p>Now, the proof:</p>
<p><img src=""https://i.imgur.com/L6fJu7J.png"" alt=""""></p>
<ul>
<li>Reasoning within PA (ie, the logic of the agent):
<ul>
<li>Suppose the agent crosses.
<ul>
<li>Further suppose that the agent proves that crossing implies U=-10.
<ul>
<li>Examining the source code of the agent, because we're assuming the agent crosses, either PA proved that crossing implies U=+10, or it proved that crossing implies U=0.</li>
<li>So, either way, PA is inconsistent -- by way of 0=-10 or +10=-10.</li>
<li>So the troll actually blows up the bridge, and really, U=-10.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Therefore (popping out of the second assumption), if the agent proves that crossing implies U=-10, then in fact crossing implies U=-10.</li>
<li>By Löb's theorem, crossing really implies U=-10.</li>
<li>So (since we're still under the assumption that the agent crosses), U=-10.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>So (popping out of the assumption that the agent crosses), the agent crossing implies U=-10.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Since we proved all of this in PA, the agent proves it, and proves no better utility in addition (unless PA is truly inconsistent). On the other hand, it will prove that not crossing gives it a safe U=0. So it will in fact not cross.</li>
</ul>
<p>The paradoxical aspect of this example is not that the agent doesn't cross -- it makes sense that a proof-based agent can't cross a bridge whose safety is dependent on the agent's own logic being consistent, since proof-based agents can't know whether their logic is consistent. Rather, the point is that the agent's ""counterfactual"" reasoning looks crazy. <em>(However, keep reading for a version of the argument where it <strong>does</strong> make the agent take the wrong action.)</em> Arguably, the agent should be uncertain of what happens if it crosses the bridge, rather than certain that the bridge would blow up. Furthermore, the agent is reasoning as if it can control whether PA is consistent, which is arguably wrong.</p>
<p>In <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/hpAbfXtqYC2BrpeiC/troll-bridge-5#4AQdDtGEfzs8Prb9d"">a comment</a>, Stuart points out that this reasoning seems highly dependent on the code of the agent; the ""else"" clause could be different, and the argument falls apart. I think the argument keeps its force:</p>
<ul>
<li>On the one hand, it's still very concerning if the sensibility of the agent depends greatly on which action it performs in the ""else"" case.</li>
<li>On the other hand, we can modify the troll's behavior to match the modified agent. The general rule is that the troll blows up the bridge if the agent would cross for a ""dumb reason"" -- the agent then concludes that the bridge would be blown up if it crossed. I can no longer complain that the agent reasons as if it were controlling the consistency of PA, but I can still complain that the agent thinks an action is bad because that action indicates its own insanity, due to a troublingly circular argument.</li>

<p>One interpretation of this thought-experiment is that it shows proof-based decision theory to be essentially a version of EDT, in that it has EDT-like behavior for Smoking Lesion. The analogy to Smoking Lesion is relatively strong:</p>
<ul>
<li>An agent is at risk of having a significant internal issue. (In Smoking Lesion, it’s a medical issue. In Troll Bridge, it is logical inconsistency.)</li>
<li>The internal issue would bias the agent toward a particular action. (In Smoking Lesion, the agent smokes. In Troll Bridge, an inconsistent agent crosses the bridge.)</li>
<li>The internal issue also causes some imagined practical problem for the agent. (In Smoking Lesion, the lesion makes one more likely to get cancer. In Troll Bridge, the inconsistency would make the troll blow up the bridge.)</li>
<li>There is a chain of reasoning which combines these facts to stop the agent from taking the action. (In smoking lesion, EDT refuses to smoke due to the correlation with cancer. In Troll Bridge, the proof-based agent refuses to cross the bridge because of a Löbian proof that crossing the bridge leads to disaster.)</li>
<li>We intuitively find the conclusion nonsensical. (It seems the EDT agent should smoke; it seems the proof-based agent should not expect the bridge to explode.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Indeed, the analogy to smoking lesion seems to strengthen the final point -- that the counterfactual reasoning is wrong.</p>
<p>I've come to think of Troll Bridge as ""the real smoking lesion"", since I'm <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5bd75cc58225bf0670375452/smoking-lesion-steelman"">generally not satisfied with how smoking lesion is set up</a>.</p>
<p>But is proof-based decision theory <em>really</em> a version of EDT? I think there's more to say about the analogy, but a simple explanation is this: both EDT and proof-based decision theory evaluate actions by adding them to the knowledge base and seeing what the world looks like under that additional assumption. Or, to put it differently, proof-based DT reasons about actions as if they're observations. That's the fundamental idea of evidential decision theory.</p>
<p>Still, as good as the analogy might be, you still probably shouldn't be convinced until you've seen the Troll Bridge defeat <em>real</em> EDT.</p>
<h2>Probabilistic Version</h2>
<p>For the purely logical version, I said that we can't fault the conclusion (because the agent can't prove that it is safe to cross the bridge) – only the <em>reasoning</em> is being critiqued. However, the probabilistic version better demonstrates the severity of the reasoning error; it illustrates an EDT agent making what seems to be an outright mistake.</p>
<p>It's reasonable to avoid crossing the bridge if you're only thinking about provable results. But we might expect an agent who balances risks and rewards would decide to cross, so long as it believes the probability of PA being inconsistent is low. Thus turns out not to be the case.</p>
<p>Here's the setup.</p>
<p>Suppose that the agent uses a probability distribution which ""respects logic"" in the sense that it assigns probability zero to anything which is logically refutable. (This assumes logical omniscience. I'll drop that assumption later.)</p>
<p>The agent is as follows: <em>if P(cross)=0, cross; if P(¬cross)=0, don't cross; else, take the action with highest expected utility, breaking ties by not crossing.</em> The idea is that we are trying to take the highest-expected-utility action; however, we must handle cases where this isn't well-defined. Choosing to take an action when the probability of the action is zero guarantees that the agent can never prove its own action; it is a version of the chicken rule. Breaking ties by not crossing is arbitrary, but gives the simplest version of the example, because this choice reduces the number of cases we need to check.</p>
<p>The troll is as follows: <em>if the agent crosses the bridge due to the P(cross)=0 clause, blow up the bridge.</em></p>
<p>Reasoning in the logic of the agent:</p>

<p>Thus, by Löb's theorem, we see that <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\Box (A=cross \rightarrow U=-10)""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-ams-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">□</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">(</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">A</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.077em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">=</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">c</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">r</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">o</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">s</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">s</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">→</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.084em;"">U</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.077em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">=</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.298em; padding-bottom: 0.446em;"">−</span></span><span class=""mjx-mn""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">10</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">)</span></span></span></span></span></span>.</p>
<p>Therefore, since the agent is certain of things which are provable, the agent assigns expected value -10 to crossing. Since the expected value of the other action will always be higher than this, and since we know the agent doesn't ever really enter into the P=0 conditions, the agent will choose not to cross. <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\Box""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-ams-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">□</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>Notice that this reasoning did not depend much on the values 10, 0, and -10. The utility of the bridge getting blown up could be -0.000001, and the agent still won't cross. <em>It isn't weighing the risk; it's decided that the worst outcome is inevitable.</em> In the case of proof-based agents, I said that the overall decision not to cross was understandable, since proof-based agents are unable to weigh the risks. A probabilistic agent, however, should intuitively be able to say ""I don't know whether the bridge will get blown up, because it involves reasoning about properties of myself which I'm fundamentally uncertain about; but, the odds look decent."" But that's not what happens: instead, it is sure that crossing is unfavorable, <em>no matter what overall probability it assigns to P(A=cross)=0</em>.</p>
<p>So, in this case we conclude that the Troll Bridge example results in a chicken-rule-based agent taking the wrong action overall. The agent shouldn't be sure that it would cross ""for the right reason"" (it should assign some probability to P(A=cross)=0, since it can't know that its own logic is consistent). However, intuitively, it should be able to assign some probability to this, and balance the risks. If the downside risk is U=-0.000001, and the probability it assigns to its logic being consistent is not similarly small, it should cross -- and in doing so, it would get +10.</p>
<p>As mentioned for the proof-based agent, the agent's code is a bit arbitrary, and it is worth asking how important the details were. In particular, the default in the case of a tie was to not cross. What if the default in case of a tie were to cross?</p>
<p>We then modify the troll's algorithm to blow up the bridge if and only if P(A=cross)=0 <strong>or</strong> there is a tie. The proof then goes through in the same way.</p>
<p>Perhaps you think that the problem with the above version is that I assumed logical omniscience. It is unrealistic to suppose that agents have beliefs which perfectly respect logic. (Un)Fortunately, the argument doesn't really depend on this; it only requires that the agent respects proofs which it can see, and eventually sees the Löbian proof referenced.</p>
<h2>Random Exploration</h2>
<p>The frustrating thing about Troll Bridge is that it seems like the agent could just cross the bridge, and things would be fine. The proof that things <em>wouldn't</em> be fine <em>relies on the fact that the agent accepts that very proof as sufficient reason</em>; so can't we just ignore that kind of proof somehow?</p>
<p>One thing you might try is to consider a learning agent, and force random exploration so the agent just crosses the bridge sometimes. If the agent crosses the bridge, it should be able to see that it's safe, right?</p>
<p>However, we have to ask: what's the appropriate version of Troll Bridge for the exploring agent? Remember I said that the basic idea of Troll Bridge is that the troll blows up the bridge if the agent crosses ""for a dumb reason"" -- ie, for a reason other than ""crossing is a good idea"". Random exploration falls into this category.</p>
<p>Furthermore, random exploration is really closely analogous to the chicken rule. Consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>(A) The first chicken rule I mentioned: if you prove that you don't take an action, you immediately take it.</li>
<li>(B) The second chicken rule mentioned: if P(A)=0, then do A.</li>
<li>(C) Epsilon-chicken: if P(A)&lt;epsilon, then do A.</li>
<li>(D) Epsilon-exploration: randomly do A with probability epsilon.</li>
</ul>
<p>(A) is very similar to (B) if the probability distribution respects proofs in the way I mentioned previously; if the probability distribution has the further property of assigning positive probability to anything not disproven, then they're exactly the same. (C) is a natural generalization of (B). (B) tells us what to do when the EDT decision rule isn't well-defined (we can't condition on probability zero events). (C) generalizes this by treating small-probability events in the same way (we might expect our conditional beliefs to be bad for small-probability events, since we presumably don't have much experience with them; so we treat it as if it's the undefined case). (B) ensures there are no zero-probability actions, which means we don't actually ever have to deal with the EDT decision rule being non-well-defined; similarly, (C) ensures no action is almost surely never taken, which helps ensure that our conditional expectations for all actions are empirically grounded.</p>
<p>(C) and (D) are very similar; (C) just supplies pseudorandomness vie the agent's own probabilities. Whenever the agent is too confident about what it does, it does something else. This makes the randomization unpredictable <em>too the agent</em>. (D) supplies randomness from an external source instead.</p>
<p>So we have a chain connecting the chicken rule to random exploration.</p>
<p>(Another way of thinking about the similarity: The chicken rule ensures that there are models of the agent's beliefs in which each action is taken, so that the agent can have sensible logical reasoning about each alternative. Epsilon-exploration ensures that the empirical experiences of the agent include all of the actions, so that the agent can have reasonable empirical estimates of consequences of each action.)</p>
<p>OK. So Troll Bridge for an exploring agent should blow up the bridge on exploration, <em>or</em> if PA is inconsistent. An agent could look like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>With small probability, explore.
<ul>
<li>If exploring, flip a coin to cross or not cross.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If P(cross)=0, cross.</li>
<li>If P(¬cross)=0, don't cross.</li>
<li>Otherwise, take the max-expected-value action, breaking ties randomly.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm still assuming that the agent's probability distribution respects proofs, as before. I'm also assuming this agent is playing the game repeatedly, and learning. I also must assume that the agent has found Now, the agent reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Suppose <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\Box""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-ams-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">□</span></span></span></span></span></span>(cross <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\rightarrow""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">→</span></span></span></span></span></span> u=-10) for a particular round.
<ul>
<li>Further suppose I crossed on that round.
<ul>
<li>By the first supposition, I knew the payout of crossing to be low; and I must also have known that the payout of not crossing is higher, since I can prove that. Since I can prove what both payouts are, the expected values must equal those, unless PA is inconsistent (in which case P(cross)=0 anyway, since my beliefs respect proofs). So I can only be crossing the bridge for two reasons -- either this is an exploration round, or P(cross)=0.</li>
<li>In either case, crossing the bridge yields payout u=-10.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Therefore, cross <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\rightarrow""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">→</span></span></span></span></span></span> u=-10 in fact.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>So <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\Box""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-ams-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">□</span></span></span></span></span></span>(cross <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\rightarrow""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">→</span></span></span></span></span></span> u=-10) <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\rightarrow""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">→</span></span></span></span></span></span> (cross <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\rightarrow""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">→</span></span></span></span></span></span> u=-10).</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the agent proves that a proof of crossing being bad implies crossing is actually bad, the agent further must prove that crossing is bad in fact, by Löb.</p>
<p>I did this for the logically omniscient case again, but as before, I claim that you can translate the above proof to work in the case that the agent's beliefs respect proofs it can find. That's maybe a bit weird, though, because it involves a Bayesian agent updating on logical proofs; we know this isn't a particularly good way of handling logical uncertainty.</p>
<p>We can use logical induction instead, using an epsilon-exploring version of LIDT. We consider LIDT on a sequence of troll-bridge problems, and show that it eventually notices the Löbian proof and starts refusing to cross. This is even more frustrating than the previous examples, because LIDT might successfully cross for a long time, apparently learning that crossing is safe, and reliably gets +10 payoff. Then, one day, it finds the Löbian proof and stops crossing the bridge!</p>
<p>That case is a little more complicated to work out than the Bayesian probability case, and I omit the proof here.</p>
<h2>Non-examples: RL</h2>
<p>On the other hand, consider an agent which uses random exploration but doesn't do any logical reasoning, like a typical RL agent. Such an agent doesn't need any chicken rule, since it doesn't care about proofs of what it'll do. It still needs to explore, though. So the troll can blow up the bridge whenever the RL agent crosses due to exploration.</p>
<p>This obviously messes with the RL agent's ability to learn to cross the bridge. The RL agent might never learn to cross, since every time it tries it, it looks bad. So this is sort of similar to Troll Bridge.</p>
<p>However, I think this isn't really the point of Troll Bridge. The key difference is this: the RL agent can get past the bridge if its prior expectation that crossing is a good idea is high enough. It just starts out crossing, and happily crosses all the time.</p>
<p>Troll Bridge is about the inevitable confidence that crossing the bridge is bad. We would be fine if an agent decided not to cross because it assigned high probability to PA being inconsistent. The RL example seems similar in that it depends on the agent's prior.</p>
<p>We could try to alter the example to get that kind of inevitability. Maybe we argue it's still ""dumb"" to cross only because you start with a high prior probability of it being good. Have the troll punish crossing <em>unless the crossing is justified by an empirical history of crossing being good</em>. Then RL agents do poorly no matter what -- no one can get the good outcome in order to build up the history, since getting the good outcome <em>requires</em> the history.</p>
<p>But this still doesn't seem so interesting. You're just messing with these agents. It isn't illustrating the degree of pathological reasoning which the Löbian proof illustrates -- <strong>of course</strong> you don't put your hand in the fire if you get burned every single time you try it. There's nothing wrong with the way the RL agent is reacting!</p>
<p>So, Troll Bridge seems to be more exclusively about agents who do reason logically.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>All of the examples have depended on a version of the chicken rule. This leaves us with a fascinating catch-22:</p>
<ul>
<li>We need the chicken rule to avoid <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/Rm6oQRJJmhGCcLvxh/p/zcPLNNw4wgBX5k8kQ"">spurious proofs</a>. As a reminder: spurious proofs are cases where an agent would reject an action if it could prove that it would not take that action. These actions can then be rejected by an application of Löb's theorem. The chicken rule avoids this problem by ensuring that agents cannot know their own actions, since if they did then they'd take a different action from the one they know they'll take (and they know this, conditional on their logic being consistent).</li>
<li>However, Troll Bridge shows that the chicken rule can lead to another kind of problematic Löbian proof.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, we might take Troll Bridge to show that the chicken rule does not achieve its goal, and therefore reject the chicken rule. However, this conclusion is very severe. We cannot simply drop the chicken rule and open the gates to the (much more common!) spurious proofs. We would need an altogether different way of rejecting the spurious proofs; perhaps a full account of logical counterfactuals.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is possible to come up with variants of Troll Bridge which counter some such proposals. In particular, Troll Bridge was originally invented to counter proof-length counterfactuals, which essentially <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=369"">generalize chicken rules</a>, and therefore lead to the same Troll Bridge problems).</p>
<p>Another possible conclusion could be that Troll Bridge is simply too hard, and we need to accept that agents will be vulnerable to this kind of reasoning.</p>

Having an opaque long formal proof often feels insufficient, similarly some arguments feel unsatisfying because they contain many subjectively arbitrary choices.<br><br>An explanation is a sequence of claims corroborating a statement. A reasoner understands an explanation (or rather has more understanding of an explanation) when each claim has low surprisal given its mental state after reading all of the previous statements, starting with the problem statement. The aggregate of the surprise over the entire explanation indicates how poorly understood it is. The measure of surprisal is essentially about the reconstructability of the explanation using something like Monte Carlo Tree Search over all possible explanations informed by the mental states of the reasoner.<br><br>The surprisal of claims is roughly how long it would take for the reasoner to come up with the claim given its current mental state. Since the space of such claims is exponential in the length of the claim the reasoner has to use some form of attention to guide its search. We can model this attention mechanism by an ontological graph. Such a graph encodes the collection of mental concepts and associative links between them. The mental state of the reasoner is an activation of an ensemble of concepts and the associative links make available other concepts, lowering their surprisal when invoked in the next step of the explanation.<br><br>When a step in an explanation is highly surprising some understanding is needed. The reasoner does this by modifying its ontology, creating new concepts or creating associations that make the step more obvious. I call such modifications insights, a good insight gives clarity and makes steps obvious and subjectively trivial.<br><br>To examine this situation consider the mutilated chessboard problem[1] and subsequent explanation:<br></p><blockquote>Suppose a standard 8×8 chessboard has two diagonally opposite corners removed, leaving 62 squares. Is it possible to place 31 dominoes of size 2×1 so as to cover all of these squares?<br><br>The answer that it is impossible. Opposite corner squares always have the same color so that there are 30 and 32 white or black squares left. A domino placed on the chessboard will always cover one white square and one black square. So there will always be either two white or two black squares left which can not be covered by a domino.</blockquote><p><br>The problem becomes trivial after making available the idea of attaching the invariant to the problem. We can imagine that the color invariant is activated by the joint activation of the domino and chess nodes in the reasoners ontology.<br><br>In this scheme there is nothing stopping a reasoner from encoding solutions to all problems directly into its ontology. This leads to 1) poor generalization/transfer; and<br>2) a large ontology.<br><br>Compression deals with both of these issues, indeed compression is closely related to generalization. General compression works by recognizing and exploiting all detectable patterns with certain computational bounds. Once these patterns are detected they can be extract and recognized in different contexts, which is generalization.[2]<br><br>Compressing the ontology has the same general shape as understanding explanations, except this time we want to understand all elements in our ontology given the rest of the ontology. This is related to drop-out: how surprised would I be of this ontological node given that it was not in my ontology. Compressing of the ontology has the nice feature that the ontology becomes more fault tolerant: things that are forgotten but once well understood can be reconstructed from context.<br><br>In the example of the mutilated chessboard we can explain the insight by noting that is a general instance of attaching invariant to problems.<br></p><p>I believe there is both pressure to prune nodes with low surprisal (beliefs that do not pay rent) and low activation rates. Very low surprisal nodes can be safely pruned as they are reconstructible from context. On the other hand, nodes with very high surprisal are hard to recall (i.e. get activated) and will also be pruned. This explains why opaque formal proofs don't feel like satisfying explanations, it's hard to fit them into our information retrieval indices.</p><p><br>[1]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutilated_chessboard_problem"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutilated_chessboard_problem</a></p><p>[2]: Compression in the colloquial sense only exploits patterns with very low computational complexity</p>",mthq,mthq,mthq,

Hearing the same advice from other people and only <strong><em>really</em></strong> understanding it the third time (though internally you felt like you <strong><em>really</em></strong> understood the first time) seems inefficient. Having to give yourself the same advice or have the same conversation with yourself over and over again also seems pretty inefficient. Recently, I’ve had significant progress with<strong><em> actually </em></strong>causing internal shifts, and the advice.. Well, you’ve probably heard it before. But hopefully, this time you’ll <strong><em>really</em></strong> get it. </p><h1>Signs you might not be <strong><em>actually</em></strong> updating. </h1><ul><li>You do some focusing, and you discover a problem and you talk to a part of yourself and work through it. Then a week later, you find yourself having the same conversation with that part of you. </li><li>You change your mind about doing something but find that suspiciously your behaviour is not changing or doesn’t change for that long. </li><li>Someone says “X” and you go “oh yes, X”.  Then, some time passes. Then someone else says “X” and you go “ohhh yes, X, now I get it”. Then, some time passes. Then someone else says “X” and you go “ohhhh yes of course, X, now I really get it”. Etc. </li><li>You feel like you believe X but yet keep finding yourself behaving as though you don’t believe X. </li><li>You feel like your rationalisations are running so deep that you can’t seem to catch them. You&#x27;re doing things that seem to make sense but then something might happen that makes you feel like your behaviour was actually driven by a &#x27;rationalisation&#x27;. To make this clearer, imagine something happens (event Y) that changes your opinion of X. Maybe you realise that the thing &#x27;shouldn&#x27;t&#x27; be much evidence at all. You decide it will only slightly affect your opinion. You may end up with a certain conclusion by looking at old evidence and this thing Y (that you have actively decided to only weight a small amount). Then, something may then happen that makes you <strong><em>really</em></strong> believe that thing Y is small evidence. Suddenly, you are looking at the same evidence and this thing Y (weighted the same amount as you tried to weight it before), but you have a different conclusion. It&#x27;s like you are looking at the evidence through a different &#x27;lens&#x27;. It seems like you are able to exploit uncertainty around evidence to get differing conclusions depending on this &#x27;lens&#x27;. This whole thing might make you feel large internal distrust. </li></ul><h1>Plausible hypotheses</h1><p><strong>Plausible hypothesis 1:</strong> Some things take longer to digest than other things. Maybe you just need time to actually update models. </p><p><strong>Plausible hypothesis 2:</strong> If you change a fundamental node in your ‘belief network’, it can be hard to change patterns of behaviour and reactions. You might not believe thing X but behave like you think thing X because you are mostly working on auto-pilot and habits are hard to break out of. This is especially salient when a piece of actual behaviour is ‘far away’ from the node that has been changed (so that it seems unrelated at a glance).  </p><p><strong>Plausible hypothesis 3</strong>: A lot of the things people are trying to teach you are ‘purple knowledge’. This may mean you may just need lots of gesturing at a thing, or to develop a certain intuition before a certain thing <strong><em>actually</em></strong> makes sense. </p><p>I think it’s likely these hypotheses play at least some role in what is happening. However, in my case something else was playing a larger role.</p><h1>What was going wrong for me</h1><p>The hypothesis that seems right for my situation: I was not <strong><em>really</em></strong> listening to some parts of me. In an attempt to listen to all parts of me, I was doing a few things that would cause the process to fail: </p><ul><li>Calling things ‘biases’. Using words like ‘anxiety’ and ‘perfectionism’ that cause me to box up a part of myself and believe blindly that it’s doing something wrong. Warning flags should arise if you realise that you believe something is wrong for reasons separate to the actual words that part of you is saying. If no matter what a part of you says, you think it’s wrong - you’re being pretty brutal to yourself. </li><li>Saying “I don’t know what the right answer is and should listen to all parts of me” whilst internally feeling like one side of me is obviously going to win </li><li>Looking at a part of myself and believing that it’s trying to help but just thinking that it’s going to be ‘silly’ because it was adapted for a different situation “which definitely doesn’t apply here”. </li><li>Strawmanning a part of myself. Being quick to feel like I’ve understood a part of myself and resolved the problem there. Wanting to solve the problem quickly and just assuming feelings of discomfort afterwards was just ‘residue pain’. </li><li>Deferring to “experts”. Person Y told me X was good and I understand their reasoning, so X must be good. The little part of me that disagrees is just being stupid.</li><li>Using words like ‘weird’ when talking about any disagreement I have with an ‘expert’ and feeling pressure to update quickly (encourages strawmanning a part of myself, and being quick to think I&#x27;ve understood where a part of me is coming from). </li><li>Not focusing enough throughout the process to make sure I’m in actual contact with the part of me that feels a certain way. It might be especially hard to be in touch with the parts of you when talking to an &#x27;expert&#x27;.</li><li>Not paying attention to meta parts. Maybe I’m trying to decide between X and Y. I shouldn’t just be paying attention to my feelings about X and Y. It’s good and worthwhile to pay attention to why I’m finding it hard to make this decision. Or why I&#x27;m finding it confusing. There may be parts that should be involved in the discussion that are missing. </li><li>Just thinking really hard and not doing experiments. If you are unsure about a tradeoff or if something is true or just a nice story, experiment with it in the real world. Come up with hypotheses and test them. </li></ul><p>The thing that changed and allowed me to actually start updating more efficiently was that I <strong><em>actually</em></strong> started believing that all parts of me are pretty smart. I started believing this because I started actually listening to myself and realised that these parts of me weren’t saying the ‘obviously wrong’ things I thought they were saying. I began to stop just listening to experts and going ‘what they are saying makes sense’ and started having conversations where I just entirely let the part of me that disagreed say all the reasons it disagreed and ‘fight’ the expert. I allowed that part of me to have contact with the world and this meant that part of me could learn. And it worked. </p><p>This whole post is something you’ve probably heard before - “listen to all parts of you”, “don’t write the final line”, etc. None of this stuff was new to me, and yet, it feels like a lesson I’ve just learnt. I hope you let the part of you that might think this is all wrong ‘fight’ with me. And hopefully that will cause one of us to <strong><em>actually </em></strong>update towards the truth. </p>",SaraHax,sarahax,SaraHax,

It is one that has, in different ways, has been brought up many times before. Rohin Shah, for example, complained that the behaviour of everything from robots to rocks can be described by utility functions. The conclusion seems to be that being an expected utility maximiser tells us nothing at all about the way a decision maker acts in the world - the utility function does not constrain. This clashes with arguments that suggest, for example, that a future humanity or AI would wish to self-modify its preferences to be representable as a utility function.</p><p>According to Wikipedia’s definition, a decision maker can be modelled as maximising expected utility if its preferences over <em>mutually exclusive outcomes</em> satisfy completeness, transitivity, continuity and independence. This is neat. However, it still leaves us with free choice in ordering over our set of mutually exclusive outcomes. The more outcomes we have, the less constrained we are by utility maximisation and when we look closely there are often a LOT of mutually exclusive outcomes, if we give ourselves truly free range over the variables in question.</p><p>In the context of thought around AI safety, introductions to these axioms have not denied this but added a gloss of something like  <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/F46jPraqp258q67nE/why-you-must-maximize-expected-utility"">‘if you have a consistent direction in which you are trying to steer the future, you must be an expected utility maximizer’</a>,</u> in this case from Benya's post in 2012. Here the work done by ‘consistent direction’ seems to imply that you have reduced the world to a sufficiently low dimensional space of outcomes. Though I agree with this sentiment, it seems fuzzy. I hope to add some clarity to this kind of qualification. To put it another way, I want to see what restrictions we need to add to regain something like the intuitive notion of the maximiser and see if it is still sufficiently general as to be worth applying to theoretical discussions of agents.</p><p><strong>Pareto Frontier of Concepts</strong></p><p>A quick aside: Why do we want to use the idea of a utility maximiser? The explanation that comes to mind is that it is felt to be a concept that lies on the Pareto frontier of a trade-off between the explanatory power of a concept and the lack of troubling assumptions. I doubt this framing is new but I drew up a little diagram anyway.</p><span><figure><img src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/yGuo5R9fgrrFLYWuv/ejuhylmynhdovey4qc3w"" class=""draft-image "" style=""width:40%""></figure></span><p><strong>Explaining Too Much</strong></p><p>What I want to do is move from considering utility functions in general to particular classes of utility functions.

In this case most humans can be shown to make decisions not compatible with any preference ordering. </p><p>When we construct this scenario we are imagining that people are in identical states when they are offered the various choices. However, we could instead construct these lotteries as being offered at distinct moments in time, and allow preferences over money to vary freely as time goes on. Now we are assuming instead the class of utility functions <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""U:\mathbb{R}^2\rightarrow\mathbb{R}""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.084em;"">U</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.151em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">:</span></span><span class=""mjx-msubsup MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-texatom""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-ams-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">R</span></span></span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sup"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: 0.615em; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mn"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">2</span></span></span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">→</span></span><span class=""mjx-texatom MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-ams-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">R</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> where the input is the pair (gain in money at current time <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""t""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">t</span></span></span></span></span></span>, time). Importantly, a person can still make irrational decisions with respect to their individual utility function, but now there is <em>no behaviour that can be ruled out by this abstraction.</em></p><p>The basic point is the obvious one that the class of potential utility functions decides the extent to which the utility function constrains behaviour. Note that even the first class of utility functions over money is extremely permissive - the Allais paradox only works because the possible outcomes in terms of money are identical, but in any scenario where the quantities involved in the lottery are different, one could make any set of decisions and remain free of inconsistency. I may for example have wildly different preferences for having £1, £1.01, £1.02 etc.. It is also important to note that we only need to have one such 'free' variable in our utility function to strip it of its predictive power.</p><p><strong>Restricting Function Classes</strong></p><p>The next question is whether it is possible to tighten up this theory so that it accords with my intuitive notion of a maximiser, and whether too much is lost in doing so.</p><p>One simple way is to reduce possible trajectories to a discrete space of outcomes - I want an aligned AI, I want to be alive in 20 years etc - and view all possible decisions as lotteries over this space. No arguments from me, but we certainly want a more expressive theory.</p><p>The example given in Eliezer's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUjc1WuyPT8"">Stanford talk</a>, which opens with an argument as to why advanced AIs will be utility maximisers, is that of a hospital trying to maximise the number of lives saved. Here we find the rather unsurprising result that one's preferences can be gainfully modelled as maximising expected utility... if they were already a linear function of some persistent real world variable.</p><p>What if we go beyond linear functions though? There certainly seems to be a space for 'near to a goal' functions, like radial basis functions, both in theoretical and practical uses of utility functions. What about cubics? Any polynomials? My instinct is to reach for some kind of notion of smooth preferences over a finite number of 'resources' which persist and remain similarly valued over time. This certainly does a lot of work to recover what we are assuming, or at least imagining, when we posit that something is a utility maximiser. </p><p>However, there seem to be nearly maximal examples of non-smoothness that still allow for a class of utility functions that constrain behaviour. For example, take the class of preferences over a rational number in which all I care about is the denominator when the number is in its simplest form.

In most situations, were these preferences over my store of dollars for example, this would seem to be outside the class of utility functions that would meaningfully constrain my action, since this function is not at all smooth over the resource in question. However, the are imaginable cases, such as when my action space is to multiply my bank account by a lottery of other rationals, in which a class of utility functions incorporating this sort of information represents a meaningful restriction on my behaviour. </p><p>A contrived example? Completely, but what this implies is that the real problem is not strictly in the way in which our function class is able to map 'real' variables to utility but in the way in which our decisions represent a restriction of our future outcome space.</p><p><strong>Connecting Function Classes and Decision Spaces</strong></p><p>The result is the perhaps obvious point that whether a class of utility functions constrains behaviour in a given situation is function not just of either the class in question or the type of actions available but a question of the extent to which our available actions are correlated with the possible. When this is true for all utility functions in the class we are considering, our utility function becomes capable of constraining behaviour (though there may still be cases where no course of action could not result from a utility function). This is more likely to happen when our objective must be a simple function of persistent real world states but it does not require this simplicity, as the above example shows.</p><p>To take an example of how this works in practice: in economics textbooks we will encounter a wide range of utility functions. These will of course determine the way that the agent behaves in the given scenario. More than this though, the very fact that these agents are utility maximisers feels as if it constrains their behaviour, not just because of the specific utility function but in the kind of calculating, maximising reasoning that it enforces. Under this analysis, the reason that it seems this way is that all utility functions that we might expect in such a scenario, whether logarithmic, quadratic, lexical, all are such that any given utility function, our actions will change the amount of utility we expect to be available. This is not because of the class of potential utility functions exactly, but because the action space/utility function class combination are such that the actions and changes in magnitude of available utility are always linked. (In this pedagogical case of course we come to expect this with good reason because the utility function/action space pair are selected to produce interesting interaction.)</p><p>What we need to find, for a given agent to be constrained by being a 'utility maximiser' is to consider it as <em>having a member of a class</em> of utility functions where the actions that are available to it systematically alter the expected utility available to it - for <strong>all</strong> utility functions within this class. This is a necessary condition for utility functions to restrict behaviour, not a sufficient one. Note that within almost any natural class there will be the degenerate utility function in which all results result in equal utility and therefore all actions are permissible - this must be deliberately excluded to make predictions. It is this notion of <em>classes</em> rather than individual utility functions, which saves my post (I hope) from total triviality.</p><p><strong>What remains?</strong></p><p>All this talk of restricting function classes is fine, and there is much more to say, but we're talking about selecting the class of possible utility functions as a modelling tool! We can restrict the class of functions that their utility function <em>is allowed</em> to be a part of, but if decision makers can employ a function from outside our allowed class and laugh at our Dutch books then what use is all this talk, and these abstractions?</p><p>Well, a few things. Firstly I hope this leads some people to clearer understanding of what is going on with utility functions - I feel I am now thinking more clearly about them, though only time will tell if this feeling lasts.</p><p>Second, when we make statements about utility functions being meaningful for an agent which wants to steer the future in a consistent direction, we have a more direct way of talking about this.</p><p>Third, there may be some ways in which such restrictions are natural for interesting classes of agents.</p><p>One thing to consider about a system, with respect to how we should model it, is whether we should expect a system to systematically acquire the capacity to control variables that are of relevance to it.</p><p>If I understand them correctly, systems which run according to active inference/predictive processing (of which humans may be a member) can be interpreted as maximising the power to predict observed variation (in this case entropy), presumably where variation is measured across a finite set of information streams. This may suggest that these systems naturally converge to methods of behaviour that are well modelled by utility functions of a particular class and so the abstraction of utility functions may regain meaning while still accurately describing such systems.</p><p><strong>Sweeping the Floor</strong> </p><p>So what becomes of our rock that maximises its rock-like actions? Firstly, we can say that the class of utility functions needed to represent these 'decisions' is simply too broad to be consistently correlated with the minimal freedom of  'action' that a rock has, and thus our abstraction has no predictive power.  Second, of course, is that thinking about utility in this way emphasizes that utility is a way of representing decisions. and a rock does not make decisions. How do we know? I'm not entirely sure, but it's not a question that can be offloaded to utility theory. </p><p>And what of our humans, and AIs, that may wish to modify themselves, in order to become truly consistent utility maximisers? Does this represent a likely happening? I think this may well still be true, for humans at least, but what is going on is not purely the result of utility functions but comes from the fact that humans seem to (a) organize their way of evaluating to situations to simpler outcome spaces so that there is a restriction of the space of utility functions that contains all of the possible ways in which humans value trajectories and (b) is such that all possible functions in this class require humans to take decisions which are consequential the evaluation of this utility function. In some ways this is very similar to the 'steering the future' hypothesis presented at the beginning but hopefully with some further clarification and operationalization of what this means.</p><p>My conclusions are getting shakier by the paragraph but it's posting day here at MSFP and so the flaws are left as an exercise to the reader.</p>",Hoagy,hoagy,Hoagy,

I think this intuition started as wishful thinking. I didn't have time to study all three of my favorite subjects, so I hoped that studying one would eventually lead to all the others. The rest of this post aims to convince you (and me) that it wasn't <em>just</em> wishful thinking.</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- </p><p>Imagine you live in the world of mathematics. The things around you are groups and manifolds and numbers. You can't touch anything. You <em>can</em> touch symbols floating around the objects, and only by moving these symbols around can you interact with the objects. This is Logic. Eventually you notice that the symbols are made of the same stuff as everything else, and have their own symbols. By thinking hard and manipulating these symbol symbols very carefully, you find a way to get the symbols to manipulate themselves. This is a Computer and with it you interact with the world more easily. <em>Logic actualizes computers</em>.<br><br>Imagine, in your platonic world, you come across a library which claims to contain proofs of every true fact of arithmetic, and only true facts. You also discover that you can build a Computer out of not just logic, but also the numbers around you. Since it's made of numbers, the library should know about it. You teach the computer to ask the library for proofs that it will finish computing and halt, and for proofs that it will run forever. You also teach the computer to disobey the library. If the library tells the computer it will halt, it should run forever. If the library tells the computer it will run forever, it should halt. If the library gives you any proof, it will have lied. If it doesn't, then there are facts it does not know, so it lied at the beginning. The library fades away, it was an illusion all along. <em>Computers restrain logic</em>. <br><br>Imagine you grow tired of your platonic world and you want to build a universe with planets and people and everything else. What could you build it out of? The only thing at your disposal is math. You teach your computer what numbers are needed to represent each bit of stuff, and how every bit of stuff will change at every step, then turn it on. You watch as the platonic world of numbers transmutes into the world of physics and stuff. <em>Computers actualize physics</em>.<br><br>Imagine looking into your universe from the outside. What would you see? If you made the universe infinite, you would see every logically possible configuration of stuff somewhere inside, constrained by the laws of physics you chose. If you made it grow in a certain way, you would expect to see the universe split into different universes like the first, but with different laws of physics. If you built in something like Quantum Mechanics, you would see the universe developing in such a way that pieces stop interacting, each split recording every ""decision"".  Perhaps, if you build it right, and you look far enough, you would see every conceivable (consistent) mathematical structure. <em>Physics actualizes logic.</em><br><br>Imagine you taught your universe how to make a particle that knew the entire future of any lightbulb it hits, and scatters to the left if the lightbulb is going to turn on, and scatters right if the lightbulb won't. Consider a turned off lightbulb in a room with a light-switch on its right, and a self-destruct switch on its left. If the lightbulb will turn on, the particle should scatter left and destroy the light before it will ever turn on. Contradiction. If the lightbulb never turns on, the particle should scatter right and turn the light on. Contradiction. The particle fades away, it was an illusion all along. <em>Logic constrains physics</em>.<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br><br>Imagine you live in an actual universe. There are planets and people, and everything else. You had a dream about symbols moving themselves, so you moved some particles in a clever way so that they mirror the computer in your dream. But with actual time you have to wait for your computer to finish thinking, which sometimes takes forever, and sometimes it doesn't have enough particles in the right places for it to mirror all the calculations. These <em>computers </em>are much more<em> constrained by physics,</em> so using them is much more complex. <em>Complexity is for computers inside universes</em>.<br><br>Imagine that you are curious. You see planets and people and computers and everything else around you, and you wonder how they work. You do some experiments and discover that there seem to be some rules that everything obeys, rules your computer can learn. Given any set up, could you figure out how it will behave? You can build computers out of the universe, so the rules should know about them. You attach a lightbulb that turns on only if the computer halts, and tell the computer to use the rules to figure out whether any photons leave the lightbulb in this configuration of particles, but you teach the computer to disobey whatever it derives. If it derives photons leaving the lightbulb, it will run forever and keep the lightbulb off. If it sees to the end of time and learns that the lightbulb never turns on, it stops and turns on the light. Both contradictions. Therefore, it can't know its behavior forever in the future, and keeps calculating forever. The laws aren't enough to decide everything quickly. <em>Bounded Physical Laws are for universes containing computers</em>. <br><br>Imagine you are playing a game with your friend where he gives you a number and you have to factor it. This game takes a really long time for bigger numbers, but you can't just make numbers up to trick your friend because he can check your numbers  easily by multiplying. Some problems are easy-<strong>P</strong>easy, some problems are hard. The best games involve problems that seem <strong>N</strong>ot easy,  but can be checked easy-<strong>P</strong>easy (<strong>NP</strong>). Logic is a game like this. After all, a proof is easy to check, but often hard to find. Maybe, by some clever trick, all problems which are hard but can be checked easily are actually easy (<strong>P</strong> = <strong>NP</strong>). Then Math would be easy. <em>Complexity automates Logic (or shows why it can't be automated)</em>.<br><br>Imagine you found a particle that tries to determine if a lightbulb will light up and scatter left if it will, and right if it won't, but it only has access to limited information about the lightbulb. The particle can only know with probability p that the lightbulb will turn on. To comply with the rules best it can, it will scatter left with probability p and scatter right with probability 1-p. Consider a turned off lightbulb in a room with a light-switch on its right, and a self-destruct switch on its left. If it scatters left with probability p&gt;50% (or p&lt;50%), then the lightbulb will never turn on with probability (1-p) &gt; 50% (or (1-p) &lt; 50%), a contradiction. The same thing happens if it scatters right. But, if p = 50% exactly, everything stays consistent. The particle scatters left and right randomly. <em>Bounded Physical Laws preserve Logical Consistency (and randomize in case of inconsistency)</em>.<br><br>Imagine you find that the universe is different than you thought, it actually works on complex numbers and probabilities and ""entanglement"" and it turns out that you can build something that does computation in a completely different way from your computer. When you use this new machine, it seems like it can play games like factoring much faster than you could before, and you wonder if it can do all hard problems faster. If it can, you can automate math (and maybe physics and art and music and politics and...), which seems just way too powerful, so you expect it can't. If you found even newer laws, and built even stranger computers, would they ever be able to do something like that? Maybe, but it still seems unlikely. Maybe even as <em>Bounded Physical Laws actualize complexity</em> (by offering new designs over time), <em>complexity constrains physics</em> (By preventing <strong>P</strong> = <strong>NP</strong>).  <br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Thinking Machines live in an actual universe. They act within the constraints of a Bounded Physical Universe, they think within the constraints of Complexity. <br><br>We live in an actual universe. We see planets and people and computers and everything else, but the people and the computers look more and more the same, and because we're forcing them to look alike and not understanding why they look alike, we aren't sure how the computers will turn out. And the planets and everything else don't have any say at all, only the people do. Maybe we constrain the computers and the computers actualize us. Or maybe we actualize the computers, and the computers constrain us.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Diagram</p><br><br><span><figure><img src=""https://i.imgur.com/U18vJDr.jpg""></figure></span><p><a href=""!(https://i.imgur.com/U18vJDr.jpg)

It would be easy to flip around the constraint/actualization directions in a lot of places, and in other places there are much deeper connections than those presented (e.g. Curry-Howard Correspondence between Logic and Computation). The point was to get across my impression that all of these fields are very closely related, and that by considering the relationships between physics and computational complexity (as bounded versions of their idealized forms) you might learn something about the bounded version of idealized Logic, which I wildly speculate to be something helpful to AI Safety, like embedded agency or something.

I do not intend to present novel results or define a research agenda.</p><h1>1. Motivation</h1><p>The capital of Mozambique is Maputo. This is a fact about the world I learned  in school many years ago. Some part of my brain must have changed in order to store this fact and allow me to remember it today. It may be possible, <em>in principle</em>, to recover this fact by simply looking at my brain.    </p><p>In this post, I consider an analogous topic in the context of Artificial Intelligence: <em>is it possible to retrieve the knowledge stored in a neural network? </em>This line of enquiry could be a step towards more transparent AI.</p><h1>2. Query-Based Network Analysis</h1><p>Suppose we train a RL agent in the virtual sandbox environment <a href=""https://www.minetest.net"">Minetest</a>. In this environment, agents can use tools called <a href=""https://wiki.minetest.net/Pickaxe"">pickaxes</a> to efficiently ""mine"" and collect objects made of stone. A pickaxe is an example of a <a href=""https://wiki.minetest.net/Tool"">tool</a>. Tools have some properties that distinguish them from other items (e.g. tools cannot be ""stacked"" in the inventory).</p><p>We may try to retrieve the knowledge represented in the internal state of the agent by means of queries. For instance: at which point, during training, does the RL agent learn that <em>a pickaxe is a tool?</em> </p><h2>2.1 Clarifying the Query</h2><p>It seems plausible to me that this question could be asked ""as it is"" by an observer in order to gauge the agent's understanding of its environment. That is to say, at the moment of posing the question, it seems perfectly meaningful. However, further thought reveals some vagueness in it: what <em>exactly</em> is a pickaxe? What <em>exactly</em> is a tool? <em>What does it really mean for a pickaxe to be a tool? </em>It is funny how easily one can become confused with words like ""really"" and ""exactly"". <em> </em></p><p>In this example, it seems plausible to interpret the question in reference to the source code of the Minetest engine. Let us assume, for the sake of the argument, that the source code uses an object-oriented approach, and contains a <em>Tool</em> class, and a <em>Pickaxe</em> class which is a subclass of the former. The fact ""a pickaxe is a tool"" can be recast as a claim that the Pickaxe class implements all relevant aspects of the Tool class.</p><p>When we ask similar queries for agents that learn in the real world (e.g. ""when has a system learned the fact that the capital of Mozambique is Maputo?""), formalising the query is not as straightforward. A possible solution to this issue could be to introduce <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science)"">ontologies</a> (in the sense used in information science). An ontology defines formally the properties, meaning, and relations between categories and entities in a particular domain. Such ontologies could be used to model relevant aspects of a target domain and used analogously to the source code in the previous example. However, the addition of a new ""layer"" between the real-world domain and the query can be a source of problems if the ontology fails to capture all relevant aspects of the domain. </p><h2>2.2 Two Approaches to Query Answering</h2><p>Once the query has been formally defined, I find at least two approaches to answering it. The first is to define a battery of tests to gather evidence that all relevant features or aspects of the fact have been learned by the agent. For instance, if we observe that the agent has learned not to stack pickaxes, we may conclude that this particular aspect of the Tools class has been learned. However, this approach quickly runs into trouble, since it seems very hard to ensure that the designed suite of tests captures all relevant aspects of the query. For instance, an agent may not attempt to stack iron pickaxes, but perhaps it would attempt to stack bronze pickaxes, if it found them. Furthermore, this approach does not entirely satisfy the original desideratum of retrieving knowledge directly from the network, because it depends on tests (and the number of required tests is potentially very large). </p><p>A second approach is to attempt to define a structure-preserving mapping between the learned model of the network and the representation of the Pickaxe and Tool classes. This approach is more exhaustive than the previous and does not require tests. However, the questions of how to define such mapping, and what kind of structure should be preserved by it, become the crux of the whole problem.</p><p>The knowledge representation analysis described in [<a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01281"">1</a>] can be roughly seen as an example of this method. This article describes RL agents trained to play a ""capture the flag"" game in a 3D environment. In order to study the ways in which knowledge is represented in these systems, a simple ""ontology"" consisting of 200 Boolean facts is defined. To test whether these facts have been learned, a classifier is used in order to decode these facts from the agent's recurrent hidden state. The classifier is trained with input data labelled manually, according to whether each fact holds in the environment. If the classifier can ""decode"" a fact with sufficient accuracy, the fact is deemed to have been ""learned"". Effectively, the classifier is implementing the ""mapping"" between the state of the network and the ontology-based query, and the ""structure"" to be preserved is the sufficient separability between states where the fact holds, and states where it does not. The analysis verified that the number of learned facts increases monotonically in time during training, and discovered that some facts are represented by single-neutron responses. </p><h2>2.3 A Challenge for the Query-Based Approach</h2><p>In addition to all the difficulties already mentioned, retrieving knowledge from a neural network by means of queries (ontology-based or otherwise) can be affected by a severe problem:</p><blockquote><em><strong>Sarge:</strong> You mean you could have turned the bomb off any time!? Why didn't you tell us? And don't say I didn't— <br><strong>Gary:</strong> <strong>You didn't ask.</strong> <br><strong>Sarge:</strong> *growls in irritation*</em></blockquote><p>— <em><a href=""https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Machinima/RedVsBlue"">Red vs. Blue</a></em></p><p>If the knowledge stored in a network is probed via a set of queries, it might be the case that much of it is not revealed due to the fact that crucial questions are simply not asked. This can be particularly problematic in applications where a the neural network must be completely transparent. </p><h1>3. Comprehensive Analysis via Pattern Recognition</h1><p>To prevent the problem discussed in the previous section, we would like to ensure we retrieve <em>all knowledge </em>represented in the network. However, it is unclear what this means. In some way, we already know everything the network ""knows,"" since all the values of all parameters of a network are accessible at any time during training. However, these parameters do not describe what the network ""knows"" in a way that is intelligible to a human. This is analogous to receiving a picture as a list of pixels and RGB colours, and being asked about its contents. What we need is a way to process the state of a network in a way that is both <em><strong>exhaustive</strong></em> and <em><strong>meaningful to a human</strong></em>.</p><p>The kind of process that would solve this problem would need to look at the function implemented by a network at a particular step during training, and recognise in it patterns that are intelligible to us, such as abstract algorithms, structures, ontologies, or processes. In some cases, this process would need to reveal more than just the knowledge stored in the network, as it may be hard to extricate it from other aspects of the learned model, like action policies or  evaluation functions. The question of how to define and execute such process is far from trivial. </p><p>However, even if we had a process like this, the approach based on pattern-recognition may still fail. Imagine, for instance, a world similar to ours where a sophisticated neural network was trained to predict the motion of celestial bodies. Suppose the network learned and stored in it the laws and concepts of General Relativity. Next, suppose that it was possible to analyse the contents of the network using some form of comprehensive pattern-recognition approach, as described above. I would expect the process to the retrieve a formal representation of GR from the network. However, imagine that the physicists in this world had not yet discovered GR, and mathematicians had not yet developed the types of tools required to formulate the theory. In such a world, it seems hard to see how the work of the network could be interpreted in a way that was intelligible to humans. Even if we had a perfect process that reliably extracted all the higher-level structure encoded in the network, the ontologies uncovered by it may be impossible to understand. Similarly, it is possible that sufficiently advanced neural networks in our world may represent knowledge in terms of ontologies that are incomprehensible for us.</p><h1>4. Conclusion</h1><p>Retrieving knowledge represented in a neural network is a challenging task. Two approaches for addressing this problem have been discussed: a query-based approach, and a pattern-recognition approach. The first approach queries the network using a formal ontology, while the second processes the model learned by a network in order to output high-level ontologies. The first approach seems more tractable than the second, but it is also more limited, since  some knowledge may go undetected due to our failure to ask relevant questions. The second approach can also be limited by the fact that it may yield knowledge which is incomprehensible for humans.</p><hr class=""dividerBlock""><p>[1] Jaderberg, M.,  Czarnecki, W.M., Dunning, I., Marris, L.,  Lever, G., Garcia Castañeda, A., Beattie, C., Rabinowitz, N.C., Morcos, A.S., Ruderman, A., Sonnerat, N., Green, Tim., Deason, L., Leibo, J.Z., Silver, D., Hassabis, D., Kavukcuoglu, K. and Graupel, T. 2019. <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01281"">Human-level performance in 3D multiplayer games with population-based reinforcement learning.</a> Science, Vol. 364, Issue 6443, pp. 859-865.</p>",Jaime Ruiz,jaime-ruiz,Jaime Ruiz,
BS7Syu2buhLYRjkwY,Algorithmic Similarity,algorithmic-similarity,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/BS7Syu2buhLYRjkwY/algorithmic-similarity,2019-08-23T16:39:47.706Z,28,14,10,False,False,,"<h1>The Problem </h1><p>If someone asked you and me to each write a python program to solves some novel problem then it wouldn't be surprising if our solutions looked quite different. If we then tried explaining to the other person the way our own program worked, one thing that might happen is that we would realize that in spite of surface differences in the way that we wrote it the solutions were actually quite similar. We might have called variables different names, done some steps in a different order and so on, but both programs worked for the same reasons.</p><p>Another thing that might happen is that even after really understanding how the other persons program worked the solutions still seemed different. Maybe each program would seem to rely on different mathematical facts. Maybe you would realize that the way I saw the problem was fundamentally different from the way you saw it, you'd never thought about it like that before, and so the approaches I considered were in a totally different regime from the ones you considered. Yours might run asymptotically faster than mine, in a way such that even if I tried to cut out redundancies and optimize my algorithm I could never make it run as fast as yours without fundamentally changing how it worked. Mine might generalize better in some direction, whereas yours might not generalize as well or maybe generalize in a different direction. </p><p>This is the kind of intuition that a formal theory of algorithmic similarity should seek to capture. Given two Turing machines that compute the same function it should be able to tell us to what degree they use the same or different algorithms. Exactly how course or fine-grained the classification should be is unclear, and maybe different versions could work with different levels of detail, but it should capture some of our intuitive notions of algorithmic similarity, e.g. that changing the name of a variable generally doesn't change the algorithm, whereas there are fundamental differences between the sieve of Erathostenes and the AKS primality test. </p><p>A different problem that might be the same problem or might be a different but related problem is the question of whether one program uses/contains another program.</p><h1>A Variant</h1><p>Consider a simple program that outputs 1 if x&gt;y and else outputs 0. Call this program F1. And lets suppose that I know how to compute x-y when x&gt;y or x=y. Then I might write a program that computes the absolute difference of two natural numbers x,y in the following way: </p><p>def P1(x,y):</p><ul><li>if F1(x,y)==1</li><ul><li>output x-y</li></ul><li>if F1(x,y)==0</li><ul><li>output y-x</li></ul></ul><p>This specific program clearly makes use of F1. But lets say we had a different program F2 that computed the same function as F1 but in a fundamentally different way. Then we could define:</p><p>def P2(x,y):</p><ul><li>if F2(x,y)==1</li><ul><li>output x-y</li></ul><li>if F2(x,y)==0</li><ul><li>output y-x</li></ul></ul><p>   Now, in some ways P1 and P2 look the same, since they both follow the following general outline:</p><ul><li>if x&gt;y</li><ul><li>output x-y</li></ul><li>else</li><ul><li>output y-x</li></ul></ul><p>Yet P1 contains F1 whereas P2 does not. Intuitively, if it turned out that the algorithm in F1 didn't actually work as we thought and so didn't compute the function we thought it did, then P2 would still work the same but P1 would be broken. </p><p>The general question we would like the theory to answer is thus: given two algorithms, determine whether (and maybe to what degree) one contains the other.</p><p>Notice that even if an algorithm contains F1 this might be much harder to spot than in the above example of P1, especially if we allow it to use trivial variations of F1 and still have it count. When humans write programs they explicitly write them in a modular form so that it is easy to see how they work and what components they contain, but in cases such as algorithms created by gradient descent, figuring out how they work and which components they contain can be much harder. </p><p>Notice also that this is a question at the level of algorithms not functions. You can't just say that absolute difference contains F1 whereas addition does not, even if the most natural way to make an absolute difference algorithm contains F1 and most addition algorithms really shouldn't have need of F1. </p><p>Finally, though P1 and P2 used different algorithms to compute the greater-than-function they both still used some algorithm to compute the greater-than-function, and so we might be interested in the more general question of whether a given program contains the greater-than-function at all, irrespective of whether it uses F1, F2 or something else entirely. </p><p>In a similar vein, and more related to the first question of algorithmic similarity, even though at some level of resolution P1 and P2 are different since one uses F1 and the other F2, we would still like our theory to recognize that the overall strategy of P1 and P2 were the same, and to differentiate that strategy with other programs that might use completely different strategies, even ones that also compute the absolute difference .</p><p>So this is all well and good and technical. But of course the <em>real</em> problem is about philosophy and metaphysics. </p><h1>The Real Problem</h1><p>Mathematics is uncannily useful at describing the world. In fact a lot of the great successes of science has been to find good ways of describing parts of the world using math, whether it be general relativity describing gravity, information theory giving the woolly concept of information a precise meaning or encoding complicated real world planning problems into number crunching problems that we can just feed into a computer to get the optimal answer out. </p><p>And even if you wont go as far as proclaiming that the world simply is math, you might still believe that there is nothing in the world that can't be explained by math, that there exists such a complete mathematical description of the universe such that for every property of the real world there is a corresponding mathematical property concerning this description of the world.  </p><p>What does this have to do with algorithmic similarity? Assume the strong Church-Turing thesis i.e. that the whole universe is computable. Then a natural question to ask is, which Turing machines simulate the universe and which doesn't. This question seems like it should have an answer, some Turing machines just run to the left as fast as possible, those don't seem to simulate the universe, whereas others might encode the state of the universe on their tape and then gradually change the tape content according to the laws of physics (it would probably have been more natural to think in terms of cellular automaton). And yet, this raises the question of algorithmic similarity. Two Turing machines might use very different encodings of the world state, how do I tell that they are really computing the same universe? And on the other hand, one Turing machine might just be doing some arbitrary thing that looks complicated but is actually meaningless, how do i rule out the claim that it is just simulating the universe in an non-obvious way? </p><p>Consider now the question of whether there is diamond in the universe. For a given Turing machine simulating a universe similar to ours this question should have an answer (an answer for every time step or something). Yet in general, this seems very hard to answer. Though diamond is a natural category in the world, it might not be a very natural category in a specific encoding of the world, so even though a Turing machine simulating the universe must contain a piece that is simulating diamond, having a theory that identifies that subcompontent and differentiates it from simulations without that component look like quite the challenge.   </p><p>But even now that you know the <em>real </em>question is about cool philosophy stuff, you might still want to ask; why should I care?</p><h1>Why You Should Care</h1><p><u>Reason 1: Annoying waterfall apologists</u></p><p>The one comes to you, shows you a random waterfall and says: this waterfall is implementing a conscious human being. </p><p>What do you say to this person? They are clearly crazy, but how do you convince them of their error or at least make their position look undefendable to bystanders watching the argument? </p><p>I can imagine someone understanding minds so well on a technical level that they could build a computer that completely emulates a human mind. And maybe someone skilled enough in the art of hydrocomputation could even do the same on a waterfall. But there is just no way that a arbitrary naturally occurring waterfall is running a human mind, and yet here we are, with waterfall apologists taking over key positions in government and academia, all because we don't have the theory of algorithmic similarity that could have prevented this tragedy.  </p><p><u>Reason 2: What is a world model/What does it mean to have true beliefs</u></p><p>True belief is when your map matches the territory. These are words we all hear every morning when we recite our morning prayer to rationality. But what does it actually mean? Intuitively, there is some thing in the world, and there is some thing in your brain, and then there is some relation between the thing in the world and the thing in your brain such that the thing in your brain is ""like"" the thing in the world and you can make predictions about how the thing in the world would react merely by doing stuff to the thing in your brain. To explain what that relation is and what ""like"" means we need a theory of algorithmic similarity. (I know the point of The Simple Truth was not to ask too many questions, but honestly, how <em>are </em>the pebbles ""like"" the sheep??)     </p><p><u>Reason 3: We need it for this very unrealistic AI design</u></p><p>Consider this very unrealistic AI design. It's got at great model of the world inside its head. It considers sequences of actions, for each sequence computes the different states of the world that could follow from that sequence and how likely they each are. Then it runs a pre-programmed function on the hypothetical world states to compute the amount of value, e.g. diamonds, in each state of the world, weights each world by its likelihood and chooses the action sequence that would in expectation lead to the most value. </p><p>Forgetting the complexity of human values for the moment, how does the function count the amount of value in the representation of a world state in the AI's head? Algorithmic similarity. But wait, you might say, what if we fix the way the AI represents world states such that it's easy to look inside? This might fix part of the problem (see Ontological Identification), but we might not want to fix the AI's representation like that, maybe we want it to learn the best world model it can without constraints, but in that case we probably need a better understanding of how to look inside of computational objects. </p><p>Even disregarding values, when the AI has found a world model that yields good predictions we want it to be able to look inside that model and do stuff like count the amount of diamonds in it, or find out other physical facts about it, even if it found that model just by looking for computational objects that predicted its sensory input. </p><p><u>Reason 4: It could give us a better agent/optimizer criterion</u></p><p>In Risks From Learned Optimization the authors write: ""whether a system is an optimizer is a property of its internal  structure—what algorithm it is physically implementing—and not a property of its input-output behavior "". In this case the usefulness of a theory of algorithmic similarity is obvious. Algorithmic similarity could give us a framework with which to talk about classifications of exactly this nature.  </p><p><u>Reason 5: Because FDT needs it</u></p><p>FDT reasons by imagining that the mathematical function making its decisions have different outcomes. But the question then arises of how FDT determine what things in the universe are implementing her decision algorithm. This seems like an ideal situation for a theory of algorithmic similarity to bring some clarity. We need a theory of how similar two algorithms should be for FDT to change both of them, when one algorithm contains FDT's decision algorithm so that changing her own means changing part of the other and what it means for part of the universe to implement a decision algorithm at all. </p><p><u>Reason 6:  Deep insights into the nature of reality/Giving computational functionalism the comeback it deserves!</u></p><p>Self-explanatory. (see Computational Functionalism, these guys need help)</p><p>Now that you understand the problem and care deeply about solving it the only reasonable thing to do would be to end this blog post and get to work, right?... </p><h1>Why The Question Doesn't Make Sense And We Shouldn't Expect There To Be A Satisfying Answer</h1><p>I've been telling you tales about all the nice properties this theory will have and all the confusing situations that it will explain in a perfectly satisfying manner but all this time I was really selling you a mirage, we don't have the thing yet, and so we run the risk of the question itself just not making sense to ask. I think this is a reasonable thing to be afraid of. Intuitions can be misleading and when the thing you are looking for is this great the reason might be because it is just a magical dream.  </p><p>I don't believe so, but other smart people do. And even if you think the criticisms in the end will turn out to be invalid, they're still important to be aware of now so we know the extent of the challenges that a theory like this would somehow have to overcome. </p><p>This will not be en exhaustive list of the problems you could have with the views presented so far. In fact, there will only be one entry to the list and I will definitely not present the strongest case for it. Treat it as an appetizer. I wont even respond to the criticism, hopefully I will get back to that some time, maybe someone else will as well. I don't believe I have any knock-down arguments, that might require the full theory, but I still think there is something to be said in response.  </p><p><u>Criticism 1: It's Trivial</u></p><p>Lets say you have some system A, might be an algorithm, some casual graph, some mathematical description of the human mind or maybe the whole universe. I will give an intuitive argument that basically any other physical system can be seen as implementing this system. </p><p>First we need to identify the states that A can be in. Lets suppose A only has finitely many states, this should normally be enough since real things are generally thought to be finite, but much of the same argument would work with infinitely many states. Since this is a deterministic system, for each state there will be exactly one state that follows. You can imagine drawing this out as a huge diagram. If you also did this with something like a bucket of water then because of the astronomical amount of molecules in the bucket there would be an almost inconceivable amount of states it could be in, with all sorts of complicated connections between them.</p><p>Now the heuristic argument is that there would almost certainly be a way to identify sets of states in the bucket system such that the resulting graph were identical to the graph of system A. This might be a very unnatural coarse-graining, you might end up associating very different physical states in the bucket system and saying that they are the same, but on the other hand, when you say that a physical calculator is implementing addition you are also bundling together a bunch of distinct physical states together to make that argument. And in any case, there should definitely be something disturbing about the statement that if you just look at a bucket of water the right way it can be seen to implement pretty much anything, including a human brain.</p><p>You could try to make rules for which ways of associating states are allowed and which aren't, but this seems somewhat unnatural, and in any case it seems hard to make up a set of rules such that you could never game the definition with something like this. </p><p>There are better versions of this arguments, versions where you actually construct a trivial physical system that implements A in this way without resorting to ""almost certainly"", but I wont go into them here. For now I just want to make the remark that triviality results like these will have to be dealt with in some way for any good theory of algorithmic similarity to work, especially if we want it to have all the nice philosophical implications.   </p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>If you only remember one thing from this post, let it be this: algorithmic similarity is a cool problem and by thinking about it you can be cool too. </p><p>In terms of grand strategies for tackling the problem, well, those will be in the next post, I swear. For now, I think the main thing is to focus on the technical problem. It's interesting, it's pretty concrete and hopefully the philosophical stuff will just fall out of it when we've got the formal theory down.</p><p>In terms of work to build of, there should be plenty. For one thing, it seems like some people in proof theory are interested in similar stuff, the way they frame it is ""when are different proofs really the same"", but there are reasons to believe that the questions might be intimately related (see Curry-Howard correspondence).</p><p>There is the debate about computational functionalism in the philosophy literature, which doesn't look at the technical side of the problem as much, at least not in the way I presented it here (or so I believe), but have considered a lot of the philosophical implications.  </p><p>Finally, computational complexity theory has obviously done a lot of work that seems to be in this area, since the complexity classes are examples of classifications of programs that distinguish between different programs which compute the same function. </p><p>My impression is that a surprising amount of people and areas of thought have been in contact with pieces of this problem, and I think it would be great to try and gather as much as possible of their work in one place. I would like to compile a giant reading list/archive of stuff related to algorithmic similarity, and I hope that some of you reading this post will help by contributing links to work or ideas that you have stumbled upon and think might be relevant.</p><p>Another thing that might be useful is to compile a list of problems where for each problem there are multiple algorithms that solve the same problem in what, at least initially, seems to be different ways. I don't have many concrete examples yet but it should be relatively easy to find some. Whether or not people can agree on whether two algorithms are ""actually"" different or ""really"" just doing the same thing is another question, I predict that there might be quite a lot of disagreement on that, but that discussion might itself be useful for clarifying some intuitions. Especially interesting would be examples of algorithms having the same asymptotic run-time that nevertheless ran clearly different algorithms.  </p><p>Here is the link to the reading list, I have got some stuff already, and if you post a suggestion in the comments for something that you think should be in there, then I will add it in:</p><p><a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cC9H2sBd09OUYroo9YMFg2Gc438PEvyxnBO1PNxUZkA/edit?usp=sharing"">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cC9H2sBd09OUYroo9YMFg2Gc438PEvyxnBO1PNxUZkA/edit?usp=sharing</a></p><p>Related documents:</p><p><a href=""https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wdxLcb7nTLYl1byycXIE9tNm3G5jNaPG?usp=sharing"">https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wdxLcb7nTLYl1byycXIE9tNm3G5jNaPG?usp=sharing</a></p><p>Thanks for reading!</p>",LukasM,lukasm,LukasM,

Best case scenario it's just one argument among many. Edit: Also, thanks to feedback from others, especially Paul, I intend to write a significantly improved version of this post in the next two weeks. Edit: I never did, because in the course of writing my response I realized the original argument made a big mistake. See <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/P448hmmAeGepQDREs/review-of-soft-takeoff-can-still-lead-to-dsa"">this review.</a>]</em></p><p>I have on several occasions heard people say things like  this: </p><blockquote>The original Bostrom/Yudkowsky paradigm envisioned a single AI built by a single AI project, undergoing intelligence explosion all by itself and attaining a decisive strategic advantage as a result. However, this is very unrealistic. Discontinuous jumps in technological capability are very rare, and it is very implausible that one project could produce more innovations than the rest of the world combined. Instead we should expect something more like the Industrial Revolution: Continuous growth, spread among many projects and factions, shared via a combination of trade and technology stealing. We should not expect any one project or AI to attain a decisive strategic advantage, because there will always be other projects and other AI that are only slightly less powerful, and coalitions will act to counterbalance the technological advantage of the frontrunner. (paraphrased)</blockquote><p>Proponents of this view often cite <a href=""https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/HBxe6wdjxK239zajf/more-realistic-tales-of-doom"">Paul Christiano</a> in support. Last week I heard him say he thinks the future will be ""like the Industrial Revolution but 10x-100x faster.""</p><p>In this post, I assume that Paul's slogan for the future is correct and then nevertheless push back against the view above. Basically, I will argue that <em>even if</em> the future is like the industrial revolution only 10x-100x faster, there is a 30%+ chance that it will involve a single AI project (or a single AI) with the ability to gain a decisive strategic advantage, if they so choose. (Whether or not they exercise that ability is another matter.)</p><p>Why am I interested in this? Do I expect some human group to take over the world? No; instead what I think is that (1) an unaligned AI in the leading project might take over the world, and (2) A human project that successfully aligns their AI might refrain from taking over the world even if they have the ability to do so, and instead use their capabilities to e.g. help the United Nations enforce a ban on unauthorized AGI projects.</p><h2>National ELO ratings during the industrial revolution and the modern era</h2><p>In chess (and some other games) ELO rankings are used to compare players. An average club player might be rank 1500; the world chess champion might be <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnus_Carlsen"">2800</a>; computer chess programs are even better. If one player has 400 points more than another, it means the first player would win with ~90% probability.</p><p>We could apply this system to compare the warmaking abilities of nation-states and coalitions of nation-states. For example, in 1941 perhaps we could say that the ELO rank of the Axis powers was ~300 points lower than the ELO rank of the rest of the world combined (because what in fact happened was the rest of the world combining to defeat them, but it wasn't a guaranteed victory). We could add that in 1939 the ELO rank of Germany was ~400 points higher than that of Poland, and that the ELO rank of Poland was probably 400+ points higher than that of Luxembourg.</p><p>We could make cross-temporal fantasy comparisons too. The ELO ranking of Germany in 1939 was probably ~400 points greater than that of the entire world circa 1910, for example. (Visualize the entirety of 1939 Germany teleporting back in time to 1910, and then imagine the havoc it would wreak.)</p><p><strong>Claim 1A:</strong> If we were to estimate the ELO rankings of all nation-states and sets of nation-states (potential alliances) over the last 300 years, the rank of the most powerful nation-state at at a given year would on several occasions be 400+ points greater than the rank of the entire world combined 30 years prior. </p><p><strong>Claim 1B: </strong>Over the last 300 years there have been several occasions in which one nation-state had the capability to take over the entire world of 30 years prior.</p><p>I'm no historian, but I feel fairly confident in these claims. </p><ul><li>In naval history, the best fleets in the world in 1850 were obsolete by 1860 thanks to the introduction of iron-hulled steamships, and said steamships were themselves obsolete a decade or so later, and then <em>those </em>ships were obsoleted by the Dreadnought, and so on... This process continued into the modern era. By ""Obsoleted"" I mean something like ""A single ship of the new type could defeat the entire combined fleet of vessels of the old type.""</li><li>A similar story could be told about air power. In a dogfight between planes of year 19XX and year 19XX+30, the second group of planes will be limited only by how much ammunition they can carry.</li><li>Small technologically advanced nations have regularly beaten huge sprawling empires and coalitions. (See: Colonialism) </li><li>The entire world has been basically carved up between the small handful of most-technologically advanced nations for two centuries now. For example, any of the Great Powers of 1910 (plus the USA) could have taken over all of Africa, Asia, South America, etc. if not for the resistance that the other great powers would put up. The same was true 40 years later and 40 years earlier.</li></ul><p>I conclude from this that <em>if </em>some great power in the era kicked off by the industrial revolution had managed to ""pull ahead"" of the rest of the world more effectively than it actually did--30 years more effectively, in particular--it really would have been able to take over the world.</p><p><strong>Claim 2: </strong>If the future is like the Industrial Revolution but 10x-100x faster, then correspondingly the technological and economic power granted by being 3 - 0.3 years ahead of the rest of the world should be enough to enable a decisive strategic advantage. </p><p>The question is, <em>how likely is it that one nation/project/AI could get that far ahead of everyone else?</em> After all, it didn't happen in the era of the Industrial Revolution. While we did see a massive concentration of power into a few nations on the leading edge of technological capability, there were always at least a few such nations and they kept each other in check.</p><h2>The ""surely not faster than the rest of the world combined"" argument </h2><p>Sometimes I have exchanges like this:</p><ul><li><em>Me: </em>Decisive strategic advantage is plausible!<em> </em></li><li><em>Interlocutor: </em>What? That means one entity must have more innovation power than the rest of the world combined, to be able to take over the rest of the world!<em> </em></li><li><em>Me: </em>Yeah, and that's possible after intelligence explosion. A superintelligence would totally have that property.<em> </em></li><li><em>Interlocutor: </em>Well yeah, <em>if</em> we dropped a superintelligence into a world full of humans. But realistically the rest of the world will be undergoing intelligence explosion too. And indeed the world as a whole will undergo a faster intelligence explosion than any particular project could; to think that one project could pull ahead of everyone else is to think that, prior to intelligence explosion, there would be a single project innovating faster than the rest of the world combined!</li></ul><p>This section responds to that by way of sketching how one nation/project/AI might get 3 - 0.3 years ahead of everyone else.</p><p><strong>Toy model: </strong><em>There are projects which research technology, each with their own ""innovation rate"" at which they produce innovations from some latent tech tree. When they produce innovations, they choose whether to make them public or private. They have access to their private innovations + all the public innovations.</em></p><p>It follows from the above that the project with access to the most innovations at any given time will be the project that has the most hoarded innovations, even though the set of other projects has a higher combined innovation rate and also a larger combined pool of accessible innovations. Moreover, the gap between the leading project and the second-best project will increase over time, since the leading project has a slightly higher rate of production of hoarded innovations, but both projects have access to the same public innovations</p><p>This model leaves out several important things. First, it leaves out the whole ""intelligence explosion"" idea: A project's innovation rate should increase as some function of how many innovations they have access to. Adding this in will make the situation more extreme and make the gap between the leading project and everyone else grow even bigger very quickly.</p><p>Second, it leaves out reasons why innovations might be made public. Realistically there are three reasons: Leaks, spies, and selling/using-in-a-way-that-makes-it-easy-to-copy.</p><p><strong>Claim 3: Leaks &amp; Spies: </strong>I claim that the 10x-100x speedup Paul prophecies will not come with an associated 10x-100x increase in the rate of leaks and successful spying. Instead the rate of leaks and successful spying will be only a bit higher than it currently is.</p><p>This is because humans are still humans even in this soft takeoff future, still in human institutions like companies and governments, still using more or less the same internet infrastructure, etc. New AI-related technologies might make leaking and spying easier than it currently is, but they also might make it harder. I'd love to see an in-depth exploration of this question because I don't feel particularly confident.</p><p>But anyhow, if it doesn't get much easier than it currently is, then going 3 years to 0.3 years without a leak is possible, and more generally it's possible for the world's leading project to build up a 0.3-3 year lead over the second-place project. For example, the USSR had spies embedded in the Manhattan Project but it still took them 4 more years to make their first bomb.</p><p><strong>Claim 4: Selling etc. </strong>I claim that the 10x-100x speedup Paul prophecies will not come with an associated 10x-100x increase in the budget pressure on projects to make money fast. Again, today AI companies regularly go years without turning a profit -- DeepMind, for example, has never turned a profit and is losing something like a billion dollars a year for its parent company -- and I don't see any particularly good reason to expect that to change much.</p><p>So yeah, it seems to me that it's totally possible for the leading AI project to survive off investor money and parent company money (or government money, for that matter!) for five years or so, while also keeping the rate of leaks and spies low enough that the distance between them and their nearest competitor increases rather than decreases. (Note how this doesn't involve them ""innovating faster than the rest of the world combined."") </p><p>Suppose they could get a 3-year lead this way, at the peak of their lead. Is that enough?</p><p>Well, yes. A 3-year lead during a time 10x-100x faster than the Industrial Revolution would be like a 30-300 year lead during the era of the Industrial Revolution. As I argued in the previous section, even the low end of that range is probably enough to get a decisive strategic advantage.</p><p>If this is so, why didn't nations during the Industrial Revolution try to hoard their innovations and gain decisive strategic advantage?</p><p>England actually did, if I recall correctly. They passed laws and stuff to prevent their early Industrial Revolution technology from spreading outside their borders. They were unsuccessful--spies and entrepreneurs dodged the customs officials and snuck blueprints and expertise out of the country. It's not surprising that they weren't able to successfully hoard innovations for 30+ years! Entire economies are a lot more leaky than AI projects.</p><h2>What a ""Paul Slow"" soft takeoff might look like according to me</h2><p>At some point early in the transition to much faster innovation rates, the leading AI companies ""go quiet."" Several of them either get huge investments or are nationalized and given effectively unlimited funding. The world as a whole continues to innovate, and the leading companies benefit from this public research, but they hoard their own innovations to themselves. Meanwhile the benefits of these AI innovations are starting to be felt; all projects have significantly increased (and constantly increasing) rates of innovation. But the fastest increases go to the leading project, which is one year ahead of the second-best project. (This sort of gap is normal for tech projects today, especially the rare massively-funded ones, I think.) Perhaps via a combination of spying, selling, and leaks, that lead narrows to six months midway through the process. But by that time things are moving so quickly that a six months' lead is like a 15-150 year lead during the era of the Industrial Revolution. It's not guaranteed and perhaps still not probable, but at least it's reasonably likely that the leading project will be able to take over the world if it chooses to.</p><br><p><em>Objection: </em>What about coalitions? During the industrial revolution, if one country did successfully avoid all leaks, the other countries could unite against them and make the ""public"" technology inaccessible to them. (Trade does something like this automatically, since refusing to sell your technology also lowers your income which lowers your innovation rate as a nation.)</p><p><em>Reply: </em>Coalitions to share AI research progress will be harder than free-trade / embargo coalitions. This is because AI research progress is much more the result of rare smart individuals talking face-to-face with each other and much less the result of a zillion different actions of millions of different people, as the economy is. Besides, a successful coalition can be thought of as just another project, and so it's still true that one project could get a decisive strategic advantage. (Is it fair to call ""The entire world economy"" a project with a decisive strategic advantage today? Well, maybe... but it feels a lot less accurate since almost everyone is part of the economy but only a few people would have control of even a broad coalition AI project.)</p><br><p>Anyhow, those are my thoughts. Not super confident in all this, but it does feel right to me. Again, the conclusion is not that one project will take over the world even in Paul's future, but rather that such a thing might still happen even in Paul's future.</p><br><br><p><em>Thanks to Magnus Vinding for helpful conversation.</em></p>",daniel-kokotajlo,daniel-kokotajlo,Daniel Kokotajlo,

There is another option though which, as far as the author can tell, hardly ever gets proper attention: <em>rejecting</em> <em>Archimedean utilities</em>.  This is what I'll explore in the post.</p><br><h2><strong>Comparability</strong></h2><p>Comparability defines an equivalence class on utilities of world states (and their utilities).  </p><ul><li>Any world state is comparable to itself (<em>reflexivity</em>), </li><li>if state 1 is comparable to state 2, then state 2 is comparable to state 1 (<em>symmetry</em>), and </li><li>if state 1 is comparable to state 2 and state 2 is comparable to state 3, then state 1 is comparable to state 3 (<em>transitivity</em>).</li></ul><p>These properties follow immediately from the definition of comparability provided above.  Now we have a partition of world states into <strong>comparability classes</strong>.  Note that the comparability classes do not form a vector space: 1 torture + 1 dust speck is comparable to one torture, but their difference, 1 dust speck, is not comparable to either.</p><p>As I said before, I don't care if you disagree about dust specks.  If you think there are any pair of utilities which are in some way qualitatively distinct or otherwise incomparable (take your pick from: universe destruction, death, having corn stuck between one's teeth, the simple joy of seeing a friend, etc--normative claims about which utilities are comparable is outside the scope of this post), then there is more than one comparability class and the utility function needs a non-Archimedean co-domain to reflect this.</p><p>If you staunchly believe that every pair of utilities is comparable, that's fine--there will be only one comparability class containing all world states, and the construction below will boringly return your existing Archimedean utility function.</p><h2><strong>Pseudograded Vector Spaces</strong></h2><p>We can assign a total ordering (severity) to our collection <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""I""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em;

Note that severity does not distinguish between severe positive and severe negative utilities: the classes are defined by magnitude and not sign.  Thus, the framework is agnostic on such matters as negative utilitarianism: if one believes that reducing disutility of various forms takes priority over expanding positive utility, then that will be reflected in the severity levels of these comparability classes--perhaps a large portion of the most severe classes will be disutility-reduction based, and only after that do we encounter classes prioritizing positive utility world states.</p><p>Then we can think of utilities as being vectors, where each component records the amount of utility of a given severity level.

Abstractly, a vector space is coordinate-free, and we merely pick bases for ease of visualization and computation.  However, it is important for our purposes here that the lexicographic ordering on utility functions is ``basis-independent"", for a suitable notion of basis (otherwise, our world state preference would depend on arbitrary choices made in representations of the utility space).  In fact, classical graded vector spaces have distinguished homogeneous elements of grading i (e.g. polynomials which only have degree i monomials, rather than mixed polynomials with max degree i, in the graded vector space of polynomials), but this is too much structure and would be unnatural to apply to our setting, hence <em>pseudo</em>graded vector spaces.</p><p>The standard definition of basis (a linearly independent set of vectors which spans the space) isn't sufficient here, since we have extra structure we'd like to encode in our bases--namely, the severity grading.  Instead, we'll define a <strong>graded basis</strong> to be a choice of one positive utility vector for each grading (i.e., a map <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""d:I\to\hat\bigoplus_I \mathbb{R}""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.003em;"">d</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.151em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">:</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.064em;"">I</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">→</span></span><span class=""mjx-msubsup MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-texatom""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-munderover""><span class=""mjx-stack""><span class=""mjx-over"" style=""height: 0.213em; padding-bottom: 0.06em; padding-left: 0.305em;""><span class=""mjx-mo"" style=""vertical-align: top;""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">^</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-op""><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-size1-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.519em;"">⨁</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.439em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mi"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.064em;"">I</span></span></span></span><span class=""mjx-texatom""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-ams-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">R</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> such that <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""g(d(i))=i""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.519em; padding-right: 0.003em;"">g</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">(</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.003em;"">d</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">(</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">i</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">)</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">)</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.077em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">=</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">i</span></span></span></span></span></span>--in categorical terms, <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""d""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.003em;"">d</span></span></span></span></span></span> is a <em>section</em> of <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""g""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.519em; padding-right: 0.003em;"">g</span></span></span></span></span></span>).</p><p>Then suppose Alice and Bob agree that there are two severity levels, and even agree on which world states fall into each, but have picked different graded bases.

It means that choosing the best course of action or comparing world states requires one to only have strong information on the most severe utility levels at stake, rather than losing their mind (or overclocking their CPU) trying to consider all the tiny utilities which might add up.  Indeed, this is how most people operate in daily life; while some may counter that this is a failure of rationality, perhaps it is in fact because people understand that there are some tiny impacts which can never accumulate to more importance than the big stuff, and it can't all be chalked up to scope neglect.</p><p>Finally, completely aside from all ethical questions, I think there's some interesting math going on and I wanted people to look at it.

General and very speculative ideas.</p><p>Proposition : Deconfusing metaethics might be a promising way to increase our chances of solving AI alignment.</p><h2><strong>What do I mean by metaethics?</strong> </h2><p>Metaethics here is understood as an ideal procedure that humans are approximating when they reason about ethics i.e. when they are trying to build ethical theories. Let's have a look at mathematics for an analogy. Part of the mathematical production involves using some theory of logic to prove or disprove some conjecture about some mathematical object. Theorems, lemmas and properties that one can derive from axioms working with some logic is, roughly, part of how mathematics progresses. Another analogy is how we learn about regularities in the world by approximating Solomonoff induction. It seems that we are lacking some formalised, ideal rational procedure of ethical progress that would help us with sorting and generating ethical theories. Such a procedure seems difficult to figure out and potentially crucial to help solving AI alignment.</p><h2><strong>Why could this be important?</strong> </h2><p>A better understanding of metaethics could help us decide among different ethical theories and how to generate new ones. Furthermore, knowing what the world should become and how AI should interact with it might requires us to make progress on how we should think about ethics to enlighten how we could think about aligning AI. For example, aligning AI with human values, learning and aggregating human preferences in some way, avoiding X-risks are all ethical propositions of what we should do. It is plausible that these views are flawed and that a better understanding of how to think about ethics might make us reconsider these normative stances and clarify what alignment means.</p><p>The following intuition is one of the main reasons why I think a better understanding of metaethics might be important to AI alignment research. As I am thinking more about ethics, arguing with others about it and getting more informed about the world, my ethical views evolve and it seems that I am making some sort of progress by sharpening my reasons for why I hold some ethical view or why some ethical theory seems flawed. Thus I tend to value more my future self's moral views to the extent that he has spent more time thinking about ethics and is more informed about the world so that I trust him more about deciding how I should go about transforming it. Similarly, it might be sensible for future AI systems to be able to instantiate a similar process of moral progress to update its utility function or goals according to the results of such a process that, if transparent and consulted by humans, could figure out how to transform the world through some long and efficient ethical reflection.</p><h2><strong>Some examples</strong></h2><p>For clarification, the following, non-exhaustive, criteria might be examples of how to evaluate ethical theories and constraints under which we could generate new ones.</p><ul><li>Using clean thought experiments as intuition pumps.</li><li>Constraining ethical theories by physics and other scientific domains such as evolution or computability. For example, maximising the number of 10-dimensional pink unicorns is probably not a very good ethical theory as it demands to bring values that are meaningless and incompatible with the laws of physics. Science might not tell us what to do but it can help us in knowing what we can't do or can't consider as valuable. </li><li>Formalising ethical theories further than a lot of existing ethical theories that are mostly represented through natural language. This could ease the evaluation and learning of ethical theories by some AI and yield more consistent ethical theories. </li><li>Favor simplicity : avoid adding unnecessary arbitrary values. </li><li>Favor Universality : try to be as observer independent as possible. Ideally we might want our ethical theories to be applicable not just to humans but to all sorts of other physical systems.</li></ul><h2><strong>Possible objections</strong></h2><p>This approach of AI alignment might be too top-down in its current formulation and raise a number of difficult challenges or objections toward being a research path worth pursuing : </p><ul><li>There might be no such meaningful thing as 'better ethical theories' in the absolute sense but there might be some that are better for a certain class of physical systems.</li><li>Such a project might take too long to implement. There does not seem to be any consensus regarding a better ethical theory although philosophers have been arguing and thinking about ethics for long time. </li><li>There might not be any universally compelling argument. But we still might identify a class of arguments or ethical theories that seems more viable and use them in addition to others value learning approaches. </li><li>Formalising ethics is too hard because it's too fuzzy. Indeed ethics plausibly emerges from genetic and memetic evolution and mostly reflects humans trying to gain some value from cooperation with other humans.</li></ul><p>Nevertheless such a project might have the positive aspect of not speeding up AI capability research while informing us about values and how to think about alignment. One important downside though would be that there might be other more promising projects to pursue instead.</p><h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>To conclude I would like to suggest some possible way to imagine working toward a better understanding of metaethics and producing better ethical theories. These are extremely broad and vague suggestions to stimulate research ideas. </p><ul><li>Build an ethical oracle that could be asked questions about ethical inconsistencies, moral blindspot or axiological problems. </li><li>Artificial Philosopher: Input philosophy papers on ethics and metaethics and output better understanding of metaethics and more satisfying ethical theories. </li><li>Expected utility maximiser : Update utility function in accordance to best guess about ethics for example derived from the artificial Philosopher or the ethical oracle. This would involve an additional step of translating ethical theories into utility function. </li><li>Simulate humans so that they have more time to figure out more about ethics. </li><li>Formalise ethics maybe using logic, probability and game theory. </li><li>Accelerate research in moral psychology.</li></ul><p>.</p>",Tancrede,guillaume-corlouer,Guillaume Corlouer,

Epistemic status: speculative.</em></p><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Marr_(neuroscientist)#Levels_of_analysis"">David Marr&#x27;s levels of analysis</a> is the idea that any analysis of a system involves analyzing it at multiple, distinct levels of abstraction. These levels are the computational, which describes what it is the system is trying to do, the algorithmic, which describes which algorithms the system instantiates in order to accomplish that goal, and the implementation level, describing the hardware or substrate on which the system is running. Each level <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indeterminacy_of_translation"">underdetermines</a> the other levels. You can choose lots of different algorithms for a given goal, and algorithms don&#x27;t restrict which goals can use them. A concrete example Marr uses, is that you&#x27;d have a very hard time figuring out what a feather was for if you&#x27;d never seen a bird flying, and if you only saw a bird flying you might have a very difficult time coming up with something like the design of a feather. </p><p><br/>Imagine a world that had recently invented computers. The early examples are very primitive, but people can extrapolate and see that these things will be very powerful, likely transformative to society. They&#x27;re pretty concerned about the potential for these changes to be harmful, maybe even catastrophic. Although people have done a bit of theoretical work on algorithms, it isn&#x27;t all that sophisticated. But since the stakes are high, they try their best to start figuring out what it would mean for there to be such a thing as harmful algorithms, or how to bound general use algorithms such that they can only be used for certain things. They even make some good progress, coming up with the concept of ASICs so that they can maybe hard code the good algorithms and make it impossible to run the bad. They&#x27;re still concerned that a sufficiently clever or sufficiently incentivized agent could use ASICs for bad ends somehow.</p><p>If this situation seems a bit absurd to you, it&#x27;s because you intuitively recognize that the hardware level underdetermines the algorithmic level. I argue the possibility that we&#x27;re making the same error now. The algorithmic level underdetermines the computational level, and no matter <a href=""https://l.messenger.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fpdfs.semanticscholar.org%2Fd3be%2F45f69747bc4c64666d79bab9b4a255649d5f.pdf&h=AT0P5GaLyg3sKs1ij9gQqb1LGXS83lkr6MHtheQB2GA0eGqdNYB5GTQM-lWPM3rA_qn4rn92-w7vdZydCZeYUnuDZty_MXZSyehHoFCgLfWjrlVJhU8kAFrSijWd2aonJho"">how many combinations of cleverly constructed algorithms you stack on themselves</a>, you won&#x27;t be able to bound the space of possible goals in a way that gets you much more than weak guarantees. In particular, a system constructed with the right intentional formalism should actively want to avoid being goodharted just like a human does. Such an agent should have knightian uncertainty and therefore also (potentially) avoid maximizing. </p><p>In physics (or the implementation level) there are notions of smallest units, and counting up the different ways these units can be combined creates the notion of thermodynamic entropy, we can also easily define distance functions. In information theory (or the algorithmic level) there are notions of bits, and counting up the different ways these bits could be creates the notion of information theoretic entropy, we can also define <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance"">distance functions</a>. I think we need to build a notion of units of intentionality (on the computation level), and measures of permutations of ways these units can be to give a notion of intentional (computational) entropy, along with getting what could turn out to be a key insight for aligning AI, a distance function between intentions. <br/>    </p><p>In the same way that trying to build complex information processing systems without a concrete notion of information would be quite confusing, I claim that trying to build complex intentional systems without a concrete notion of intention is confusing.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>I was thinking about the embedded agency sequence again last week, and thought “It is very challenging to act and reason from within an automaton.” Making agents which live in automata and act well in dilemmas is a concrete task for which progress can be easily gauged. I discussed this with a group, and we came up with desiderata for an automaton in which interesting agent strategies emerge.</p>
<p>In this post, I list some inspirations, some desiderata for this testing space, and then a sketch of a specific implementation.</p>
<p>The <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09469"">embedded agency paper</a> puts out four main difficulties of being embedded. The goal here is to design an automaton (i.e. agent environment) which can represent dilemmas whose solutions require insights in these four domains.</p>
<ul>
<li>Decision theory: Embedded agents do not have well-defined IO channels.</li>
<li>World models: Embedded agents are smaller than their environment.</li>
<li>Robust delegation: Embedded agents are able to reason about themselves and self-improve.</li>
<li>Subsystem alignment: Embedded agents are made of parts similar to the environment.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Inspiration</h2>
<p>I draw concepts from four different automatons.</p>
<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_War"">Core</a> <a href=""https://corewar.io/app/src"">war</a> is close to what we need I think. It’s a game that takes place on (e.g.) a megabyte of RAM, where one assembly instruction takes up one memory slot, agents are assembly programs, and they fight each other in this RAM space. It has several relevant features such as determinism, lack of input/output/interference, and fully embedded computation. I suspect limiting range of sight could make core war more interesting from an artificial-life point of view, because then agents need to travel around to see the world.</p>
<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life"">Conway’s game of life</a> is Turing complete, so can allow arbitrary program specification in principle, and so can encode basically anything you can write in a programming language. It’s extremely simple but I think too verbose to hand-write dilemmas in it.</p>
<p><a href=""https://intelligence.org/files/Botworld.pdf"">Botworld 1.0</a> is a cellular automaton designed to be interesting in an embedded-agency sense and it’s useful but pretty complex. They do encode interesting problems such as <a href=""https://github.com/machine-intelligence/Botworld/blob/master/games/StagHunt.hs"">stag hunt</a> and <a href=""https://github.com/machine-intelligence/Botworld/blob/master/games/PrisonersDilemma.hs"">prisoner’s dilemma</a>. I think something closer to core war, which is more parsimonious, would be more fruitful to design programs in.</p>
<p>Real life is <em>maybe</em> basically an automaton. Almost all effects are localized, with waves and particles traveling at most the speed of light. The transition function is nondeterministic and there are real numbers and complex numbers in the mix, but I don’t know if any of this makes a big difference from an agent-design point of view. We still have all the problems of decision theory, world models, robust delegation, and subsystem alignment.</p>
<h2>Desiderata for Automaton</h2>
<h3>Standard decision/game theory dilemmas are representable</h3>
<p>The <a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/5-and-10"">5 &amp; 10 problem</a>, (twin) prisoner’s dilemma, <a href=""https://arbital.com/p/transparent_newcombs_problem/"">transparent Newcomb problem</a>, <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/R9javXN9BN5nXWHZx/cheating-death-in-damascus-solution-to-the-fermi-paradox"">death in Damascus</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stag_hunt"">stag hunt</a>, and other problems should at least be expressible in the automaton. The 5 &amp; 10 problem especially needs to be representable. Getting the agent to know what the situation is and getting it to act well are both separate problems from setting up the dilemma.</p>
<h3>It’s actually possible for agents to win; Information is discoverable</h3>
<p>In order to decide between $5 and $10, the agent first needs to know the two available actions and their utilities. Of course you can not endow your agent with this knowledge because the same agent code needs to work in many dilemmas, plus it’s trivial to make an agent which passes one dilemma.</p>
<p>So how should agents find and use knowledge from the world? Core wars programs (called “warriors”) use conditional jumps [1]; there’s no notion of reading in or outputting on a value, but you can condition your action on a specific value at a specific location. I think this should be how agents use information and make decisions at the lowest level. (Maybe any other way of reading and using knowledge is reducible to something like this anyway?)</p>
<p>[1] “If <code>a &lt; b</code> jump to instruction <code>x</code> else jump to instruction <code>y</code>”</p>
<h3>Agents are scorable, swappable, and comparable; Money exists</h3>
<p>My hope for creating this automaton is that I (and others) will design agents for it which use self-knowledge &amp; successor-building &amp; world-modeling as emergent strategies; those strategies should not be explicitly advantaged by the physics. Yet agent designers need some sort of objective to optimize when designing agents; it needs to be clear when one agent is better than another in a given environment. The best solution I can think of is to have “dollars” lying around in the world, and the objective of agent-designers is to have the agent collect as many dollars as possible.</p>
<p>An environment includes insertion points for where agents should begin at the first timestep and the max agent size (or other constraints). The command-line utility takes in an environment file and the appropriate number of agent files and returns the number of dollars that each agent get in that world. So you could put <code>agent1</code> in transparent Newcomb, then try with <code>agent2</code>, and see which did better and how much money they made. There could also be an option for logging or interrupting &amp; modifying the environment or something.</p>
<h3>Omega is representable</h3>
<p>In general, nothing within a world can do perfect simulation of any portion of the world including itself, because the simulator is always too small, but it is possible to do pretty-good prediction. Some of the most interesting dilemmas require the presence of reliable predictors, and some of our hardest decisions in life are hard because other people are predicting us, so we want predictors to be possible within ordinary world-physics. Call the reliable predictor “Omega”.</p>
<p>We need agents to understand what Omega is and what it’s doing but somehow not be able to screw with it. This could be done with read-only zones or by giving Omega ten turns before the agent gets one turn; the turn-management could be done with “energy tokens” which agents spend as actions.</p>
<p>Omega also needs to somehow safely execute the agent without getting stuck in infinite loops or allowing the simulation to escape or move the money around or something. I have no idea about this part. Perhaps the reliable predictor should just sit outside the universe. Or we could just say that it’s against the spirit of the game to screw with Omega.</p>
<h3>Engineering details</h3>
<ul>
<li>The automaton is a command-line program that takes in one environment file (including agent insertion points) and zero or more agent files, and other options.</li>
<li>You can generate these environment &amp; agent files and agent files using your programming language of choice, or by hand, or by putting ink on a chicken’s feet, etc.</li>
<li>An agent file is a sequence of instructions (<code>operation A B</code>)</li>
<li>An option to enable logging</li>
<li>An option for debug/interference mode</li>
<li>An option for max timesteps</li>
<li>The automaton should run fast, so hill climbing over agent programs is feasible.</li>
<li>An error is thrown immediately if the agent or environment has any initial errors.</li>
</ul>
<h2>An initial specification</h2>
<p>I don’t know if this is sufficient or well-designed but here’s my current idea for an automaton. I am mostly copying core wars.</p>
<ul>
<li>The world is a finite number of ‘memory slots’
<ul>
<li>Instructions give relative distances, e.g. +5 or -5, not go straight to 0x1234</li>
<li>Memory is a circular tape. (Distances are taken modulus memory size.)
<ul>
<li>This implies agents cannot know their index in space, but it doesn’t matter anyway</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>One memory slot is a triple <code>(isMoney, hasInstructionPointer, value)</code></li>
<li>Every operation takes two arguments, which are the values of the locations which the next two slots point to
<ul>
<li>It’s like a function call  <code>operation(*A, *B)</code> where <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> are the two slots after <code>operation</code>, and <code>*A</code> means “value stored at location A”.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Each ‘agent’ is essentially an instruction pointer to a memory slot
<ul>
<li>Each timestep, each agent executes their pointer in order
<ul>
<li>If the command is not a jump, then the pointer jumps three slots ahead, to what should be the next instruction</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Agents have many operations available
<ul>
<li>Special stuff
<ul>
<li>DIE or any invalid operation kills the agent. Used e.g. when two agents want to kill each other, so they try to get each other to execute this, like in core wars</li>
<li>JIM jump to A if B is money</li>
<li>JIP jump to A if B is an instruction pointer</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Regular assembly-like stuff:
<ul>
<li>DAT works as a no-op or for data storage. If you wanted to store 7 and 14 in your program, then you could have <code>DAT 7 14</code> as a line in your agent program, and then reference those values by relative position later.</li>
<li>MOV copy from A to B</li>
<li>ADD add A to B and store in B</li>
<li>SUB subtract A from B and store in B</li>
<li>JMP unconditional jump to A</li>
<li>CMP skip next instruction if A = B</li>
<li>SLT skip next instruction if A &lt; B</li>
<li>JMZ jump to A if B=0</li>
<li>JMN jump to A if B!=0</li>
<li>DJN decrement B, then jump to A if B is not 0</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>¿Limit relative jumps to 100 or something in magnitude, then Omega can build an invincible wall around itself and blow up anything that tries to reach it?</li>
</ul>
<h2>A Contest Thing?</h2>
<p>I could publish a collection of public environments and create some private environments too. People can design agents which score well in the public environment, then submit it for scoring on the private environments, like a Kaggle contest. This, like any train/test split, would reduce overfitting.</p>
<h2>Attempting to Specify a Couple Dilemmas and Agents</h2>
<h3>Vanilla prisoner’s dilemma</h3>
<p>Two programs in two places in memory. Left is somehow defect and right is somehow cooperate. Agents can see each other’s code and reason about what the other will do. Omega kills everyone in 1000 timesteps if no decision is reached or something.</p>
<h3>Twin prisoner’s dilemma</h3>
<p>Omega copies the same agent to two places in memory. Left is defect and right is cooperate.</p>
<h3>Transparent Newcomb’s Problem / Parfit’s Hitchhiker</h3>
<p>Omega has two boxes and it gives the agent access to one or the other depending on its behavior.</p>
<h3>Omega itself in Transparent Newcomb</h3>
<p>Something like this code:</p>
<ol>
<li>Environment starts with $1,000,000 in one walled box and $0 in another box. Money cannot be created, only absorbed by agents’ instruction pointers.</li>
<li>Find where the agent is by searching through memory</li>
<li>Copy it locally and surround it with walls</li>
<li>Put trailer code on the agent that returns the instruction pointer to omega when the agent is done</li>
<li>Execute the agent</li>
<li>If it e.g. one-boxed then destroy the walls surround</li>
<li>Somehow now kickstart the real agent¿</li>
</ol>
<h3>Agent in Transparent Newcomb</h3>
<p>Probably very flawed but…</p>
<ol>
<li>Search space for any other programs</li>
<li>Somehow analyze it for copy-and-run behavior</li>
<li>Somehow infer that this other program is controlling walls around money tokens</li>
<li>Somehow infer that if you one-box then you’ll get the bigger reward</li>
<li>Output one-box by writing a 1 to the designated spot
<ul>
<li>This spot is somehow inferred through analyzing omega i guess
<ul>
<li>Or it could be a standard demarkation that many agents use, e.g. 1-2-3-3-2-1 as “communication zone”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Pre-mortem</h2>
<p>I’ll briefly raise and attempt to respond to some modes of failure for this project.</p>
<h3>The agent insertion point did too much work</h3>
<p>It could turn out that the interesting/challenging part of the embedded agency questions is in drawing the boundary around the agent, so giving the sole starting location of the agent is dodging the most important problem. I think that this problem is fully explored, however, if we somehow pause the agent and let some other things copy &amp; use its code before the agent runs. Then the agent must figure out what has happened and imagine other outcomes before it chooses actions.</p>
<h3>The agent-designer is outside of the environment. Cartesian!</h3>
<p>The human or evolutionary algorithm or whatever designing the agents is indeed outside of the universe, and cannot directly suffer consequences, be modified, etc. However, they cannot interfere once the simulation has started, and any knowledge they have must fully live in their program in order for it to succeed in a variety of environments. I think that, if you design an agent which passes 5&amp;10, Newcomb, prisoner’s dilemma, etc, then you <em>must</em> have made some insights along the way. Otherwise, maybe these problems were easier than I thought.</p>
<h3>We only find successful agents through search, and they are incomprehensible</h3>
<p>This is maybe the most likely way for this project to fail, conditioning on me actually doing the work. I would say that, even in this case, we can learn some about the agent by running experiments on it or somehow asking it questions, like how we analyze humans.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Automatons are a more accurate model of the difficulties of agency in the real world than reinforcement learning problems, so we need to do more task-design, agent-design, and general experimentation in this space. My plan is to create an automaton, used as a command-line utility, which will run a given set of agents in a given environment (e.g. prisoner’s dilemma). Ideally, we’ll have a large set of task environments, and we can design agents with the goal of generality.</p>

<h2>Prosaic AI Alignment as a generalization problem</h2>
<p>I think the current and near-future state of AI development is well-described by us having:</p>
<p>1. very little understanding of intelligence (here defined as something like ""generally powerful problem solvers""), but</p>
<p>2. a lot of 'dumb' compute.</p>
<p>Prosaic AGI development is, in my view, about using 2 to get around 1. A very simplistic model of how to do this involves three components:</p>
<ul>
<li>A parametrized <em>model-space</em> large enough that we think it contains the sorts of generalized problem solvers we want.</li>
<li>A <em>search criteria</em> which we can test for.</li>
<li>A <em>search process</em> which uses massive compute to find parameters in the model-space satisfying the search criteria.</li>
</ul>
<p>Much of ML is about designing all these parts to make the search process as compute-efficient as possible, for instance by making everything differentiable and using gradient-descent. For the purposes of this discussion I will consider an even simpler model where the search process simply samples random models from some <em>prior</em> over the model-space  until it finds one satisfying some (boolean) search criteria.</p>
<p>While we are generally ignoring computational and practical concerns it is important that the search criteria is limited - you can only check that the model acts correctly on a small fraction of the possible situations we want to use this model in. We might talk about a search criteria being <em>feasible</em> if it is both possible to gather the data required to specify it and reasonable to expect to actually find a model fulfilling it with the amount of compute you have. The goal then is to pick a model-space, prior and feasible search criteria such that the model does what we want in any situation it might end up in. Following Paul Christiano (in <a href=""https://ai-alignment.com/techniques-for-optimizing-worst-case-performance-39eafec74b99"">Techniques for optimizing worst case performance</a>) we might broadly distinguish two ways that this could be false, which we will refer to as 'generalization failures':</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Benign failure:</strong> It does something essentially random or stupid, which has little unexpected effect on the world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Malign Failure:</strong> It generalizes 'competently' but not in the way we want, affecting the world in potentially catastrophic and unexpected ways.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Benign failures are seen a lot in current ML and often labelled robustness problems, where distributional shifts or adversarial examples lead to failures of generalization. These failures don't seem very dangerous, and can usually be solved eventually through iteration and fine-tuning. This is not the case for malign generalization failure, which have far great risks. (Slightly breaking the taboo: the classic stories of training a deceptively aligned expected utility maximizer which only does what we want because it realizes it is being tested is a malign generalization failure, though in this framework this is just an example, and whether this is central or not is an empirical claim which will be explored in the second section.)</p>
<p>A contrived story which doesn't rely on superintelligence but also demonstrates a malign generalization failure is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are searching for a good design for a robot to clean up garbage dumps, so we run a bunch of simulations until we find one which passes our selection criteria of clearing all the garbage. We happily release this robot in the nearest garbage dump, and find that it does indeed clear the garbage, but alarmingly it does this by manufacturing self-replicating garbage-eating nano-bots. These nano-both quickly consume the earth. The robot itself knows nothing other than how to construct this precise set of nano-bots from materials found in a garbage-dumb, which is impressive but not generally intelligent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another class of examples are things which are generally intelligent, but in a very messy way with many blind spots and weird quirks, some of which eventually lead to catastrophic outcomes. I think a better understanding of which kinds of malign generalization errors we might be missing could be potentially very important.</p>
<p>So how do we shape the way the model generalizes? I think the key question is understanding how the <em>inputs</em>  to the search process (the model-space, the prior and the search criteria) affect the <em>output,</em> which I think is best understood as a <em>posterior</em> distribution in the model-space gained by conditioning on the model clearing the search criteria.</p>
<p>Some examples of how the inputs might relate to the outputs:</p>
<ul>
<li>With an empty search criteria the posterior is equal to the prior and unless the prior is already very specific you should expect sampling from the posterior to give models acting randomly and getting benign failures everywhere.</li>
<li>If our search criteria requires unreasonable performance on some small test-set, and our prior doesn't give a significant enough bias toward simple/general models then we should expect benign generalization failures due to 'overfitting'.</li>
<li>If our search criteria, prior and model-space only focus on a limited task but are set up to correctly identify general solutions to this task then we might expect little generalization error within this task, while getting almost entirely benign errors outside the task. This seems to be where current ML systems are situated when they work well.</li>
<li>If we pick search criteria which require good performance on increasingly general tasks, and we make sure that the prior is increasingly weighted toward the right kind of simple/general solutions then we might expect to see less generalization failure overall in a broad domain, but we also risk malign generalization errors appearing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Summing up, I think a reasonable definition of the prosaic AI alignment project is to prevent malign generalization error from ever happening, even as we try to eliminate benign errors. This seems difficult mostly because moving toward robust generalization and toward malign generalization seem very similar, and you need some way to differentially advantage the first. Some approaches to this include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Design a model-space and prior which advantages the sort of 'intended generalization' that we want, or which are transparent enough that we can use really powerful search criteria.</li>
<li>Design search criteria which effectively shift the distribution to one containing mostly robustly generalizing models. Such criteria would likely involve a lot of inspection to see how the model actually works and generalizes internally. Paul Christiano's approach of <a href=""https://ai-alignment.com/training-robust-corrigibility-ce0e0a3b9b4d"">adversarial training</a> seems like a plausibly good way to do this.</li>
<li>Find ways of making stronger search criteria feasible. An example of this is that the search criterion might be bottle-necked by human judgement and oversight, and amplification is a scheme which might remove this bottleneck and make more detailed search criteria more feasible.</li>
<li>Consider whether we can replace the idea of one big system which should generalize to any situation with many specialized systems which are allowed to have benign generalization failures in many domains. This might correspond to a more 'comprehensive services'-style solution, as described by Eric Drexler and <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/x3fNwSe5aWZb5yXEG/reframing-superintelligence-comprehensive-ai-services-as"">summarized</a> by Rohin Shah.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Reintroducing agency</h2>

<p>There are several arguments supporting this hypothesis, such as those presented by Eliezer in <a href=""https://arbital.com/p/optimized_agent_appears_coherent/"">Sufficiently Optimized Agents Appear Coherent</a> and the simplicity/effectiveness of simple optimization algorithms.</p>

<p>As a slight aside, this also gives a framing for the much discussed mesa optimization problem in the <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01820"">Risks from Learned Optimization</a> paper, which points out that there is no <em>a priori</em> reason to expect the utility function to be the one you might have used to grade the model as part of the selection criteria, and that most of the measure might in fact taken up by <em>pseudo-aligned</em> or <em>deceptively-aligned</em> models, which represent a particular example of malign generalization error. In fact, if <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""H""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.057em;"">H</span></span></span></span></span></span> is true, avoiding malign generalization errors largely comes down to avoiding misaligned mesa optimizers.</p>

I also feel generally uncomfortable resting the safety of humanity on assumptions like this, and would like a much better understanding of how generalization works in other clusters or parts of various model-spaces.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>I have tried to present a version of the prosaic AI alignment project which doesn't make important reference to the concept of agency, instead viewing it as a <strong>generalization problem</strong> where you are trying to avoid finding models which fail disastrously when presented with new situations. Agency then reappears as a potentially important cluster of the space of possible models, which under certain empirical hypotheses justifies it as the central topic, though I still wish we had more understanding of other parts of various model-spaces.</p>

<p>In April of last year, <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/rXzxMQwRq7KRonQDM/my-confusions-with-paul-s-agenda"">I wrote up</a> my confusions with Paul’s agenda, focusing mostly on approval directed agents. I mostly have similar opinions now; the main thing I noticed on rereading it was I talked about ‘human-sized’ consciences, when now I would describe them as larger than human size (since moral reasoning depends on cultural accumulation which is larger than human size). But on the meta level, I think they’re less relevant to Paul’s agenda than I thought then; I was confused about how Paul’s argument for alignment worked. (I do think my objections were correct objections to the thing I was hallucinating Paul meant.) So let’s see if I can explain it to Vaniver_2018, which includes pointing out the obstacles that Vaniver_2019 still sees. It wouldn't surprise me if I was similarly confused now, tho hopefully I am less so, and you shouldn't take this post as me speaking for Paul.</p>
<p><strong>Factored Cognition</strong></p>
<p>One core idea that Paul’s approach rests on is that thoughts, even the big thoughts necessary to solve big problems, can be broken up into smaller chunks, and this can be done until the smallest chunk is digestible. That is, problems can be ‘factored’ into parts, and the factoring itself is a task (that may need to be factored). Vaniver_2018 will object that it seems like ‘big thoughts’ require ‘big contexts’, and Vaniver_2019 has the same intuition, but this does seem to be an empirical question that experiments can give actual traction on (more on that later).</p>
<p>The hope behind Paul’s approach is <em>not</em> that the small chunks are all aligned, and chaining together small aligned things leads to a big aligned thing, which is what Vaniver_2018 thinks Paul is trying to do. A hope behind Paul’s approach is that the small chunks are incentivized to be <em>honest</em>. This is possibly useful for transparency and avoiding inner optimizers. A separate hope with small chunks is that they’re cheap; mimicking the sort of things that human personal assistants can do in 10 minutes only requires lots of 10 minute chunks of human time (each of which only costs a few dollars) and doesn’t require figuring out how intelligence works; that’s the machine learning algorithm’s problem.</p>
<p>So how does it work? You put in an English string, a human-like thing processes it, and it passes out English strings--subquestions downwards if necessary, and answers upwards. The answers can be “I don’t know” or “Recursion depth exceeded” or whatever. The human-like thing comes preloaded (or pre-trained) with some idea of how to do this correctly; obviously incorrect strategies like “just pass the question downward for someone else to answer” get ruled out, and the humans we’ve trained on have been taught things like how to do good Fermi estimation and <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/4JuKoFguzuMrNn6Qr/hch-is-not-just-mechanical-turk"">some of the alignment basics</a>. This is general, and lets you do anything humans can do in a short amount of time (and when skillfully chained, anything humans can do in a long amount of time, given the large assumption that you can serialize the relevant state and subdivide problems in the relevant ways).</p>
<p>Now schemes diverge a bit on how they use factored cognition, but in at least some we begin by training the system to simply imitate humans, and then switch to training the system to be good at answering questions or to distill long computations into cached answers or quicker computations. One of the tricks we can use here is that ‘self-play’ of a sort is possible, where we can just ask the system whether a decomposition was the right move, and this is an English question like any other.</p>
<p><strong>Honesty Criterion</strong></p>
<p>Originally, I viewed the frequent reserialization as a solution to a security concern. If you do arbitrary thought for arbitrary lengths of time, then you risk running into inner optimizers or other sorts of unaligned cognition. Now it seems that the real goal is closer to an ‘honesty criterion’; if you ask a question, all the computation in that unit will be devoted to answering the question, and all messages between units are passed where the operator can see them, in plain English.<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-YAHmH4au9vCy4DskJ-1"" id=""fnref-YAHmH4au9vCy4DskJ-1"">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Even if one succeeds at honesty, it still seems difficult to maintain both generality and safety. That is, I can easily see how factored cognition allows you to stick to cognitive strategies that definitely solve a problem in a safe way, but don't see how it does that and allows you to develop new cognitive strategies to solve a problem that doesn’t result in an opening for inner optimizers--not within units, but within assemblages of units. Or, conversely, one could become more general while giving up on safety. In order to get both it seems like we’re resting a lot on the Overseer’s Manual or way that we trained the humans that we used as training data.</p>
<p><strong>Serialized State is Inadequate or Inefficient</strong></p>
<p>In my mind, the primary reason to build advanced AI (as opposed to simple AI) is to accomplish megaprojects instead of projects. Curing cancer (in a way that potentially involves novel research) seems like a megaproject, whereas determining how a particular protein folds (which might be part of curing cancer) is more like a project. To the extent that Factored Cognition relies on the serialized state (of questions and answers) to enforce honesty on the units of computation, it seems like that will be inefficient for problems whose state are large enough that they impose significant serialization costs, and inadequate for problems whose state are too large to serialize. If we allow answers that are a page long at most, or that a human could write out in 10 minutes, then we’re not going to get a 300-page report of detailed instructions. (Of course, allowing them to collate reports written by subprocesses gets around this difficulty, but means that we won’t have ‘holistic oversight’ and will allow for garbage to be moved around without being caught if the system doesn’t have the ability to read what it’s passing.)</p>
<p>The factored cognition approach also has a tree structure of computation, as opposed to a graph structure, which leads to lots of duplicated effort and the impossibility of horizontal communication. If I’m designing a car, I might consider each part separately, but then also modify the parts as I learn more about the requirements of the other parts. This sort of sketch-then-refinement seems quite difficult to do under the factored cognition approach, even though it involves reductionism and factorization.</p>
<p>Shared memory partially solves this (because, among other things, it introduces the graph structure of computation), but now reduces the guarantee of our honesty criterion because we allow arbitrary side effects. It seems to me like this is a necessary component for most of human reasoning, however. James Maxwell, the pioneer behind electromagnetism, lost most of his memory with age, in a way that seriously reduced his scientific productivity. And factored cognition doesn’t even allow the external notes and record-keeping he used to partially compensate.</p>
<p><strong>There's Actually a Training Procedure</strong></p>
<p>The previous section described what seems to me to be a bug; from Paul's perspective this might be a necessary feature because his approaches are designed around taking advantage of arbitrary machine learning, which means only the barest of constraints can be imposed. IDA presents a simple training procedure that, if used with an extremely powerful model-finding machine learning system, allows us to recursively surpass the human level in a smooth way. (Amusingly to me, this is like Paul <em>enforcing</em> slow takeoff.)</p>
<p><strong>Training The Factoring Problem is Ungrounded</strong></p>
<p>From my vantage point, the trick that we can improve the system by asking it questions like “was X a good way to factor question Y?”, where X was the attempt it had at factoring Y, is one of the core reasons to think this approach is workable, and also seems like it won’t work (or will preserve blind spots in dangerous ways). This is because while we could actually find the ground truth on how many golf balls fit in a 737, it is much harder to find the ground truth on what cognitive style most accurately estimates how many golf balls fit in a 737.</p>
<p>It seems like there are a few ways to go about this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Check how similar it is to what you would do. A master artist might watch the brushstrokes made by a novice artist, and then point out wherever the novice artist made questionable choices. Similarly, if we get the question “if you’re trying to estimate how many golf balls fit in a 737, is ‘length of 737 * height of 737 * width of 737 / volume of golf ball’ a good method?” we just compute what we would have done and estimate if the approach will have a better or worse error.</li>
<li>Check whether or not it accords with principles (or violates them). Checking the validity of a mathematical proof normally is done by making sure that all steps are locally valid according to the relevant rules of inference. In a verbal argument, one might just check for the presence of fallacies of reasoning.</li>
<li>Search over a wide range of possible solutions, and see how it compares to the distribution. But how broadly in question-answer policy space are we searching?</li>
</ol>
<p>We now face some tradeoffs between exploration (in a monstrously huge search space, which may be highly computationally costly to meaningfully explore) and rubber-stamping, where I use my cognitive style to evaluate whether or not my cognitive style is any good. Even if we have a good resolution to that tradeoff, we have to deal with the cognitive credit-assignment problem.</p>
<p>That is, in reinforcement learning one has to figure out which actions taken (or not taken) before a reward led to receiving the reward so that it can properly assign credit; similarly the system that's training the Q&amp;A policy needs to understand well enough how the policy is leading to correct answers such that it can apply the right gradients in the right places (or use a tremendous amount of compute doing this by blind search).</p>
<p>This is complicated by the fact that there may be multiple approaches to problem-solving that are internally coherent, but mixtures of those approaches fail. If we only use methods like gradient-descent that smoothly traverse the solution space, this won't be a problem (because gradient descent won't sharply jump from one to another), but it's an open empirical question as to whether future ML techniques will be based on gradient descent. It’s not obvious how we can extricate ourselves from the dependence on our learned question-answer policy. If I normally split a model into submodels based on a lexicographical ordering, and now I’m considering a hypothetical split into submodels based on statistical clustering, I would likely want to consider the hypothetical split all the way down the tree (as updates to my beliefs on ‘what strategy should I use to A this Q?’ will impact more than just this question), especially if there are two coherent strategies but a mixture of the strategies is incoherent. But how to implement this is nonobvious; am I not just passing questions to the alternate branch, but also a complete description of the new cognitive strategy they should employ? It seems like a tremendous security hole to have ‘blindly follow whatever advice you get in the plaintext of questions’ as part of my Q-&gt;A policy, and so it seems more like I should be spinning up a new hypothetical agent (where the advice is baked into their policy instead of their joint memory) in a way that may cause some of my other guarantees that relied on smoothness to fail.</p>
<p>Also note that because updates to my policy impact other questions, I might actually want to consider the impact on other questions as well, further complicating the search space. (Ideally, if I had been handling two questions the same way and discover that I should handle them separately, my policy will adjust to recognize the two types and split accordingly.) While this is mostly done by the machine learning algorithm that’s trying to massage the Q-&gt;A policy to maximize reward, it seems like making the reward signal (from the answer to this meta-question) attuned to how it will be used will probably make it better (consider the answer “it should be answered like these questions, instead of those,” though generally we assume yes/no answers are used for reward signals).</p>
<p>When we have an update procedure to a system, we can think of that update procedure as the system's ""grounding"", or the source of gravity that it becomes arranged around. I don't yet see a satisfying source of grounding for proposals like <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/NXqs4nYXaq8q6dTTx/humans-consulting-hch"">HCH</a> that are built on factored cognition. Empiricism doesn't allow us to make good use of samples or computation, in a way that may render the systems uncompetitive, and alternatives to empiricism seem like they allow the system to go off in a crazy direction in a way that's possibly unrecoverable. It seems like the hope is that we have a good human seed that then is gradually amplified, in a way that seems like it might work but relies on more luck than I would like: the system is rolling the dice whenever it makes a significant transition in its cognitive style, as it can no longer fully trust oversight from previous systems in the amplification tree as they may misunderstand what's going on in the contemporary system, and it can no longer fully trust oversight from itself, because it's using the potentially corrupted reasoning process to evaluate itself.</p>

It describes ideas that are likely already known by many researchers. However, given how often disagreements about slow/fast takeoffs come up, I believe there is significant value in making them common knowledge.</em></p>
<hr>
<h1>Takeoff speed &amp; why it matters</h1>
<p>In Superintelligence, Nick Bostrom distinguishes between slow, medium, and fast AI takeoff scenarios (where the takeoff speed is measured by how much real-world time passes between the milestones of human-level AI (HLAI) and superintelligent AI (SAI)).
He argues that slow takeoff should be reasonably safe since the humanity would have sufficient time coordinate and solve the AI alignment problem, while fast takeoff would be particularly dangerous since we wouldn't be able to react to what the AI does.</p>
<h1>Real-world time is not what matters</h1>
<p>In many scenarios, the real-time takeoff speed indeed strongly correlates with our ability to influence the outcome. However, we can also imagine many scenarios where this is not the case.
As an example, suppose we obtain HLAI by simulating humans in virtual environments, and that this procedure additionally fully preserves the simulated humans' alignment with humanity. Since this effectively increases the speed at which humanity operates, we might get a ""fully controlled takeoff"" even if the transition from HLAI to SAI<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-dDrFT8sCdcvYPAwFS-1"" id=""fnref-dDrFT8sCdcvYPAwFS-1"">[1]</a></sup> only takes a few days of real-world time.
More generally, if our path to HLAI also increases the effectivity of humanity's efforts, the ""effective time"" we get between HLAI and SAI will scale accordingly. For example, this <em>might</em> be the case if we go the way of Iterated Distillation and Amplification or Comprehensive AI Services. Less controversially, suppose we automate most of the current programming tasks and increase the re-usability of code, such that every computer scientist becomes 100-times as effective as they are now.</p>
<h1>Conclusion: measure useful work</h1>
<p>Given these examples, <strong>I think we should measure takeoff speeds not in real-world time, but rather in</strong> (some operationalization of) <strong>the work-towards-AI-alignment that humanity will be able to do between HLAI and SAI</strong>. Anecdotal examples of such measures might include ""integral of the human-originating GDP between HLAI and SAI"" or ""number of AI safety papers published between HLAI and SAI"".
I believe that finding a non-anecdotal operationalization would benefit many AI policy/strategy discussions.</p>

osxNg6yBCJ4ur9hpi,Does Agent-like Behavior Imply Agent-like Architecture?,does-agent-like-behavior-imply-agent-like-architecture,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/osxNg6yBCJ4ur9hpi/does-agent-like-behavior-imply-agent-like-architecture,2019-08-23T02:01:09.651Z,69,31,8,False,True,,"<p>This is not a well-specified question. I don&#x27;t know what &quot;agent-like behavior&quot; or &quot;agent-like architecture&quot; should mean. Perhaps the question should be &quot;Can you define the fuzzy terms such that &#x27;Agent-like behavior implies agent-like architecture&#x27; is true, useful, and in the spirit of the original question.&quot; I mostly think the answer is no, but it seems like it would be really useful to know if true, and the process of trying to make this true might help us triangulate what we should mean by agent-like behavior and agent-like architecture.</p><p>Now I&#x27;ll say some more to try to communicate the spirit of the original question. First a giant look-up table is not (directly) a counterexample. This is because it might be that the only way to produce an agent-like GLUT is to use agent-like architecture to search for it. Similarly a program that outputs all possible GLUTs is also not a counterexample because you might have to use your agent-like architecture to point at the specific counterexample. A longer version of the conjecture is &quot;If you see a program implements agent-like behavior, there must some agent-like architecture in the program itself, in the causal history of the program, or in the process that brought your attention to the program.&quot; The pseudo-theorem I want is similar to the claim that correlation really does imply causation or the <u><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_regulator"">good regulator theorem</a></u>.</p><p>One way of defining agent-like behavior as that which can only be produced by an agent-like architecture. This makes the theorem trivial, and the challenge is making the theorem non-vacuous. In this light, the question is something like &quot;Is there some nonempty class of architectures that can reasonably be described as a subclass of &#x27;agent-like&#x27; such that the class can be equivalently specified either functionally or syntactically?&quot; This looks like it might conflict with the spirit of <u><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice%27s_theorem"">Rice&#x27;s theorem</a></u>, but I think making it probabilistic and referring to the entire causal history of the algorithm might give it a chance of working.</p><p>One possible way of defining agent-like architecture is something like &quot;Has a world model and a goal, and searches over possible outputs to find one such that the model believes that output leads to the goal.&quot; Many words in this will have to be defined further. World model might be something that has high logical mutual information with the environment. It might be hard to define search generally enough to include everything that counts as search. There also might be completely different ways to define agent-like architecture. Do whatever makes the theorem true.</p>",Scott Garrabrant,scott-garrabrant,Scott Garrabrant,

When consequentialists make commitments too soon, disastrous outcomes can sometimes result. The situation we are in (building AGI and letting it self-modify) may be one of these times unless we think carefully about this problem and how to avoid it.</em></p><p>For this post I use ""consequentialists"" to mean agents that choose actions entirely on the basis of the expected consequences of those actions. For my purposes, this means they don't care about historical facts such as whether the options and consequences available now are the result of malicious past behavior. (I am trying to avoid trivial definitions of consequentialism according to which everyone is a consequentialist because e.g. ""obeying the moral law"" is a consequence.) This definition is somewhat fuzzy and I look forward to searching for more precision some other day.</p><h2>Consequentialists can get caught in commitment races, in which they want to make commitments as soon as possible</h2><p>Consequentialists are bullies; a consequentialist will happily threaten someone insofar as they think the victim might capitulate and won't retaliate.</p><p>Consequentialists are also cowards; they conform their behavior to the incentives set up by others, regardless of the history of those incentives. For example, they predictably give in to credible threats unless reputational effects weigh heavily enough in their minds to prevent this.</p><p>In most ordinary circumstances the stakes are sufficiently low that reputational effects dominate: Even a consequentialist agent won't give up their lunch money to a schoolyard bully if they think it will invite much more bullying later. But in some cases the stakes are high enough, or the reputational effects low enough, for this not to matter.</p><p>So, amongst consequentialists, there is sometimes a huge advantage to ""winning the commitment race."" If two consequentialists are playing a game of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_(game)"">Chicken</a>, the first one to throw out their steering wheel wins. If one consequentialist is in position to seriously hurt another, it can extract concessions from the second by credibly threatening to do so--unless the would-be victim credibly commits to not give in first! If two consequentialists are attempting to divide up a pie or <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_theorem_(game_theory)"">select a game-theoretic equilibrium to play in</a>, the one that can ""move first"" can get much more than the one that ""moves second."" In general, because consequentialists are cowards and bullies, the consequentialist who makes commitments first will predictably be able to massively control the behavior of the consequentialist who makes commitments later. As the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_theorem_(game_theory)"">folk theorem</a> shows, this can even be true in cases where games are iterated and reputational effects are significant.</p><p><em>Note:</em> ""first"" and ""later"" in the above don't refer to clock time, though clock time is a helpful metaphor for imagining what is going on. Really, what's going on is that agents learn about each other, each on their own subjective timeline, while also making choices (including the choice to commit to things) and the choices a consequentialist makes at subjective time <em>t</em> are cravenly submissive to the commitments they've learned about by <em>t</em>.</p><p>Logical updatelessness and acausal bargaining combine to create a particularly important example of a dangerous commitment race. There are <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/5bd75cc58225bf067037528e/updatelessness-and-son-of-x"">strong incentives</a> for consequentialist agents to self-modify to become updateless as soon as possible, and going updateless is like making a bunch of commitments all at once. Since real agents can't be logically omniscient, one needs to decide how much time to spend thinking about things like game theory and what the outputs of various programs are before making commitments. When we add acausal bargaining into the mix, things get even more intense. <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/5bd75cc58225bf067037528e/updatelessness-and-son-of-x#5bd75cc58225bf0670375293"">Scott Garrabrant, Wei Dai</a>, and <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/9sYzoRnmqmxZm4Whf/conceptual-problems-with-udt-and-policy-selection"">Abram Demski </a>have described this problem already, so I won't say more about that here. Basically, in this context, there are many other people observing your thoughts and making decisions on that basis. So bluffing is impossible and there is constant pressure to make commitments quickly before thinking longer. (That's my take on it anyway)</p><blockquote><em>Anecdote: </em>Playing a board game last week, my friend Lukas said (paraphrase) ""I commit to making you lose if you do that move."" In rationalist gaming circles this sort of thing is normal and fun. But I suspect his gambit would be considered unsportsmanlike--and possibly outright bullying--by most people around the world, and my compliance would be considered cowardly. (To be clear, I didn't comply. Practice what you preach!)</blockquote><h2>When consequentialists make commitments too soon, disastrous outcomes can sometimes result. The situation we are in may be one of these times.</h2><p>This situation is already ridiculous: There is something very silly about two supposedly rational agents racing to limit their own options before the other one limits theirs. But it gets worse.</p><p>Sometimes commitments can be made ""at the same time""--i.e. in ignorance of each other--in such a way that they lock in an outcome that is disastrous for everyone. (Think both players in Chicken throwing out their steering wheels simultaneously.)</p><p>Here is a somewhat concrete example: Two consequentialist AGI think for a little while about game theory and commitment races and then self-modify to resist and heavily punish anyone who bullies them. Alas, they had slightly different ideas about what counts as bullying and what counts as a reasonable request--perhaps one thinks that demanding more than the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bargaining_problem#Bargaining_solutions"">Nash Bargaining Solution</a> is bullying, and the other thinks that demanding more than the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bargaining_problem#Bargaining_solutions"">Kalai-Smorodinsky Bargaining Solution</a> is bullying--so many years later they meet each other, learn about each other, and end up locked into all-out war.</p><p>I'm not saying disastrous AGI commitments are the default outcome; I'm saying the stakes are high enough that we should put a lot more thought into preventing them than we have so far. It would really suck if we create a value-aligned AGI that ends up getting into all sorts of fights across the multiverse with other value systems. We'd wish we built a paperclip maximizer instead.</p><p><em>Objection:</em> ""Surely they wouldn't be so stupid as to make <em>those </em>commitments--even <em>I </em>could see that bad outcome coming. A better commitment would be...""</p><p><em>Reply:</em> The problem is that consequentialist agents are motivated to make commitments as soon as possible, since that way they can influence the behavior of other consequentialist agents who may be learning about them. Of course, they will balance these motivations against the countervailing motive to learn more and think more before doing drastic things. The problem is that the first motivation will push them to make commitments much sooner than would otherwise be optimal. So they might not be as smart as us when they make their commitments, at least not in all the relevant ways. Even if our baby AGIs are wiser than us, they might still make mistakes that we haven't anticipated yet. The situation is like <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centipede_game"">the centipede game</a>: Collectively, consequentialist agents benefit from learning more about the world and each other before committing to things. But because they are all bullies and cowards, they individually benefit from committing earlier, when they don't know so much.</p><p><em>Objection: </em>""Threats, submission to threats, and costly fights are rather rare in human society today. Why not expect this to hold in the future, for AGI, as well?""</p><p><em>Reply: </em>Several points:</p><p>1. Devastating commitments (e.g. ""<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grim_trigger"">Grim Trigger</a>"") are much more possible with AGI--just alter the code! <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inigo_Montoya"">Inigo Montoya</a> is a fictional character and even he wasn't able to summon lifelong commitment on a whim; it had to be triggered by the brutal murder of his father. </p><p>2. Credibility is much easier also, especially in an acausal context (see above.)</p><p>3. Some AGI bullies may be harder to retaliate against than humans, lowering their disincentive to make threats.</p><p>4. AGI may not have sufficiently strong reputation effects in the sense relevant to consequentialists, partly because threats can be made more devastating (see above) and partly because they may not believe they exist in a population of other powerful agents who will bully them if they show weakness.</p><p>5. Finally, these terrible things (Brutal threats, costly fights) do happen to some extent even among humans today--especially in situations of anarchy. We want the AGI we built to be <em>less </em>likely to do that stuff than humans, not merely <em>as </em>likely.</p><p><em>Objection: </em>""Any AGI that falls for this commit-now-before-the-others-do argument will also fall for many other silly do-X-now-before-it's-too-late arguments, and thus will be incapable of hurting anyone.""</p><p><em>Reply: </em>That would be nice, wouldn't it? Let's hope so, but not count on it. Indeed perhaps we should look into whether there are other arguments of this form that we should worry about our AI falling for...</p><blockquote><em>Anecdote:</em> A friend of mine, when she was a toddler, would threaten her parents: ""I'll hold my breath until you give me the candy!"" Imagine how badly things would have gone if she was physically capable of making arbitrary credible commitments. Meanwhile, a few years ago when I first learned about the concept of updatelessness, I resolved to be updateless from that point onwards. I am now glad that I couldn't actually commit to anything then.</blockquote><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Overall, I'm not certain that this is a big problem. But it feels to me that it might be, especially if acausal trade turns out to be a real thing. I would not be surprised if ""solving bargaining"" turns out to be even more important than value alignment, because the stakes are so high. I look forward to a better understanding of this problem.</p><p><em>Many thanks to Abram Demski, Wei Dai, John Wentworth, and Romeo Stevens for helpful conversations.</em></p>",daniel-kokotajlo,daniel-kokotajlo,Daniel Kokotajlo,

You can read the rules <a href=""https://secrethitler.com/assets/Secret_Hitler_Rules.pdf"">here</a> if you aren't familiar. I haven't played social deception games regularly since 2016 but in my mind it's a really good game that represented the state of the art in the genre at that time. I'm going to discuss an interesting situation in which I reasoned poorly.</p>
<p>I was a liberal in a ten player game. The initial table set up, displaying relevant players was,</p>
<p><img src=""https://imgur.com/R7jTvsU.png"" alt=""""></p>
<p>We passed a fascist article in the first round. The next government was Marek as president and Chancellor a player 3 to the right of Marek <sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-GGzoNfKpKt7jc6aib-2"" id=""fnref-GGzoNfKpKt7jc6aib-2"">[2]</a></sup>. Marek passed a fascist article and inspected Sam and declared Sam was fascist to Sam's counterclaim that Marek was fascist. Sam was to the left of Marek so we had no data about him. The table generally supported Sam but I leaned towards believing Marek.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the game my view of possibilities looked roughly like:</p>
<p><img src=""https://imgur.com/j2J7CC4.png"" alt=""""></p>
<p>But of course I'm already approximating. From my perspective an individual is only 4/9 to be Fascist and the events that two individuals are fascist is not independent. A more careful calculation would have been:</p>

<p>So a better perspective would have been:</p>
<p><img src=""https://imgur.com/wiq7XVL.png"" alt=""""></p>
<p>I don't think I could do this math consistently in game though so I'll do the rest of the analysis with my original priors. I've included it here for reference in your future 10 player games of Secret Hitler.</p>
<p>When Marek declared Sam was Fascist the only scenario which is confidently eliminated is that both are liberal. Any reasonable liberal player is truth promoting and has no reason to lie. At first glance it seems that the possibility that both are fascist is also eliminated as the fascists should have no reason to fight each other. This doesn't strictly hold though. The fascists only need one fascist in a government to likely sink it and if they reason that the liberals will reason that one of them must be good then they have good reason to pick fights with each other. But in practice in an accusation situation the table often opts to pick neither so its a risky move.</p>
<p>Now we get into the questionable deduction I made during the game. If Marek is a fascist and he inspects a liberal he has a choice to make. He can accuse the liberal of being fascist to sow distrust among the liberals. Or he can tell the truth to garner trust with the liberals. If Marek is liberal and he inspects a fascist then he has no choice to make. He will declare that the fascist is a fascist.</p>
<p>In the moment I figured there was about a 50-50 chance that a fascist would choose to call a liberal a fascist or a liberal. Let's call fascists who lie about liberal's identities bold and fascists who tell the truth timid. I discounted the possibility that both were fascist and I reasoned with probabilities from the first square. So given that Marek had accused Sam that meant that Marek was a liberal with probability 75%.</p>
<p>The problem is I didn't adequately update on Marek's fascist presidency. In my mental model of the game it's not the improbable to draw 3 fascist articles. This mental model is derived from the fact that it generally happens once or twice a game. But its still an unlikely event in the sense that I should consider it evidence that the president was fascist. From the reports of the first group 3 fascist articles had already been buried. Even if I distrust them I can still guess at least 2 fascist articles were buried. So the probability that 3 fascist articles were drawn again is at most <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""{11\choose 5}/{14\choose 5}\approx 0.23""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-texatom""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-TeXmathchoice""><span class=""mjx-mstyle""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-texatom""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-size1-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.593em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">(</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class=""mjx-mfrac""><span class=""mjx-box MJXc-stacked"" style=""width: 0.707em;""><span class=""mjx-numerator"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; width: 1em; top: -1.319em;""><span class=""mjx-mn"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">11</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-denominator"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; width: 1em; bottom: -0.535em;""><span class=""mjx-mn"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">5</span></span></span></span><span style=""height: 1.31em; vertical-align: -0.378em;"" class=""mjx-vsize""></span></span><span class=""mjx-TeXmathchoice""><span class=""mjx-mstyle""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-texatom""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-size1-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.593em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">)</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class=""mjx-texatom""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">/</span></span></span></span><span class=""mjx-texatom""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-TeXmathchoice""><span class=""mjx-mstyle""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-texatom""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-size1-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.593em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">(</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class=""mjx-mfrac""><span class=""mjx-box MJXc-stacked"" style=""width: 0.707em;""><span class=""mjx-numerator"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; width: 1em; top: -1.33em;""><span class=""mjx-mn"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">14</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-denominator"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; width: 1em; bottom: -0.535em;""><span class=""mjx-mn"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">5</span></span></span></span><span style=""height: 1.318em; vertical-align: -0.378em;"" class=""mjx-vsize""></span></span><span class=""mjx-TeXmathchoice""><span class=""mjx-mstyle""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-texatom""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-size1-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.593em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">)</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">≈</span></span><span class=""mjx-mn MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">0.23</span></span></span></span></span></span>. Going into the investigation I had a belief that Marek was Fascist with probability about 50% but I should have already updated to ~88% that he was a fascist as opposed to an unlucky liberal (100% of the time he didn't draw 3 fascist articles he buried a liberal and is a fascist and half the rest of the time he's a fascist by my prior). Given that, even with my conjecture that Fascists make false accusations only half the time I should have guessed Marek was more likely fascist than Sam. Marek's accusation demonstrated Marek is not a timid fascist which I conjectured to be half the fascist probability mass. By Bayes' Theorem I should have updated to Marek being fascist with probability:</p>

<p>I definitely computed badly in the moment. I think my model building was also bad in a number of other ways which are harder for me to put numbers on:</p>
<ul>
<li>I thought Marek was unlikely to pick a fight since he seemed relatively new and he was very quiet after his accusation. In my mind people lie about other people's identities prepared to fight and Marek seemed sort of timid. The counterpoint to this is lying is the obvious level one strategy for fascists. A reasonable person might think its just what fascists are supposed to do.</li>
<li>I didn't factor in the probability that both were fascists at all.</li>
<li>All the players seemed to jump on Marek. I think part of the reason I defended him was a contrarian bias. But being contrarian against too big a consensus in Secret Hitler is important. If everyone agrees about something then some fascists are agreeing.</li>
<li>On the meta level I was very sleepy and new myself to not be reasoning that well or remembering basic facts that accurately. I probably should have deferred to the group.</li>
</ul>

I thought about a lot of things here like category theory, the <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1211.5122"">1-2-3 conjecture</a> and Paul Christiano's agenda. I want to start by thanking everyone for having me and saying I had a really good time. At this point I intend to go back to thinking about the stuff I was thinking about before MSFP (random matrix theory). But I learned a lot and I'm sure some of it will come to be useful. This blog is about (my confusion of) decision theory.</p>
<p>Before the workshop I hadn't read much besides Eliezer's paper on FDT and my impression was that it was mostly a good way of thinking about making decisions and at least represented progress over EDT and CDT. After thinking more carefully about some canonical thought experiments I'm no longer sure. I suspect many of the concrete thoughts which follow will be wrong in ways that illustrate very bad intuitions. In particular I think I am implicitly guided by non-example number 5 of an aim of decision theory in <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/JSjagTDGdz2y6nNE3/on-the-purposes-of-decision-theory-research"">Wei Dai's post</a> on the purposes of decision theory. I welcome any corrections or insights in the comments.</p>
<h2>The Problem of Decision Theory</h2>
<p>First I'll talk about what I think decision theory is trying to solve. Basically I think decision theory is the theory of how one should<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-JpexxbT4CMYuCCaz5-1"" id=""fnref-JpexxbT4CMYuCCaz5-1"">[1]</a></sup> decide on an action after one already understands: The actions available, the possible outcomes of actions, the probabilities of those outcomes and the desirability of those outcomes. In particular the answers to the listed questions are only adjacent to decision theory. I sort of think answering all of those questions is in fact harder than the question posed by decision theory. Before doing any reading I would have naively expected that the problem of decision theory, as stated here, was trivial but after pulling on some edge cases I see there is room for a lot of creative and reasonable disagreement.</p>
<p>A lot of the actual work in decision theory is the construction of scenarios in which ideal behavior is debatable or unclear. People choose their own philosophical positions on what is rational in these hairy situations and then construct general procedures for making decisions which they believe behave rationally in a wide class of problems. These constructions are a concrete version of  formulating properties one would expect an ideal decision theory to have.</p>
<p>One such property is that an ideal decision theory shouldn't choose to self modify in some wide vaguely defined class of ""fair"" problems. An obviously unfair problem would be one in which the overseer gives CDT $10 and any other agent $0. One of my biggest open questions in decision theory is where this line between fair and unfair problems should lie. At this point I am not convinced any problem where agents in the environment have access to our decision theory's source code or copies of our agent are fair problems. But my impression from hearing and reading what people talk about is that this is a heretical position.</p>
<h2>Newcomb's Problem</h2>
<p>Let's discuss Newcomb's problem in detail. In this problem there are two boxes one of which you know contains a dollar. In the other box an entity predicting your action may or may not put a million dollars. They put a million dollars if and only if they predict you will only take one box. What do you do if the predictor is 99 percent accurate? How about if it is perfectly accurate? What if you can see the content of the boxes before you make your decision?</p>
<p>An aside on why Newcomb's problem seems important: It is sort of like a prisoner's dilemma. To see the analogy imagine you're playing a classical prisoner's dilemma against a player who can reliably predict your action and then chooses to match it. Newcomb's problem seems important because prisoner's dilemmas seem like simplifications of situations which really do occur in real life. The tragedy of prisoner dilemmas is that game theory suggests you should defect but the real world seems like it would be better if people cooperated.</p>
<p>Newcomb's problem is weird to think about because the predictor and agent's behaviors are logically connected but not causally. That is, if you tell me what the agent does or what the predictor predicts as an outside observer I can guess what the other does with high probability. But once the predictor predicts the agent could still take either option and flip flopping won't flip flop the predictor. Still one may argue you should one box because being a one boxer going into the problem means you will likely get more utility. I disagree with this view and see Newcomb's problem as punishing rational agents.</p>
<p>If Newcomb's problem is ubiquitous and one imagines an agent walking down the street constantly being Newcombed it is indeed unfortunate if they are doomed to two box. They'll end up with far fewer dollars. But this thought experiment is missing an important part of real world detail in my view. How the predictors predict the agents behavior. There are three possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>The predictors have a sophisticated understanding of the agent's inner workings and use it to simulate the agent to high fidelity.</li>
<li>The predictors have seen many agents like our agent doing problems like this problem and use this to compute a probability of our agent's choice and compare it to a decision threshold.</li>
<li>The predictor has been following the behavior of our agent and uses this history to assign its future behavior a probability.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the third bullet the agent should one box if they predict they are likely to be Newcombed often<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-JpexxbT4CMYuCCaz5-2"" id=""fnref-JpexxbT4CMYuCCaz5-2"">[2]</a></sup>. In the second bullet they should one box if they predict that members of their population will be Newcombed often and they derive more utility from the extra dollars their population will get than the extra dollar they could get for themselves. I have already stated I see the first bullet as an unfair problem.</p>
<h2>Mind Reading isn't Cool</h2>
<p>My big complaint with mind reading is that there just isn't any mind reading. All my understandings of how people behave comes from observing how they behave in general, how the human I'm trying to understand behaves specifically, whatever they have explicitly told me about their intentions and whatever self knowledge I have I believe is applicable to all humans. Nowhere in the current world do people have to make decisions under the condition of being accurately simulated.</p>
<p>Why then do people develop so much decision theory intended to be robust in the presence of external simulators? I suppose its because there's an expectation that this will be a major problem in the future which should be solved philosophically before it is practically important. Mind reading could become important to humans if mind surveillance because possible and deployed. I don't think such a thing is possible in the near term or likely even in the fullness of time. But I also can't think of any insurmountable physical obstructions so maybe I'm too optimistic.</p>
<p>Mind reading is relevant to AI safety because whatever AGI is created will likely be a program on a computer somewhere which could reason its program stack is fully transparent or its creators are holding copies of it for predictions.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Having written that last paragraph I suddenly understand why decision theory in the AI community is the way it is. I guess I wasn't properly engaging with the premises of the thought experiment. If one actually did tell me I was about to do a Newcomb experiment I would still two box because knowing I was in the real world I wouldn't really believe that an accurate predictor would be deployed against me. But an AI can be practically simulated and what's more can reason that it is just a program run by a creator that could have created many copies of it.</p>
<p>I'm going to post this anyway since it's blog-day and not important-quality-writing day but I'm not sure this blog has much of a purpose anymore.</p>

<p>I recently (hopefully) dissolved some of my confusion about agency. In the first part of the post, I describe a concept that I believe to be central to most debates around agency. I then briefly list some questions and observations that remain interesting to me.
<em>The gist of the post should make sense without reading any of the math.</em></p>

<li>Architectures I would <em>intuitively</em> call ""agenty"":

<li>(semi-vague) ""<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_agent"">Classical AI-agent</a>"" with several interconnected modules (utility function and world model, actions, planning algorithm, and observations used for learning and updating the world model).</li>
<li>(vague) Human parametrized by their goals, knowledge, and skills (and, of course, many other details).</li>

<p>A standard item in the human mental toolbox is anthropomorphization: modeling various things as humans (specifically, ourselves) with ""funny"" goals or abilities. We can make the same mental move for architectures other than humans:</p>

<p>Antropomorphization makes good predictions for other humans and some animals (curiosity, fear, hunger). On the other hand, it doesn't work so well for rocks, lightning, and AGI-s --- not that it would prevent us from using it anyway.

<p>(A related question is how difficult is it for us to ""run"" <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""A(θ)""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">A</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">(</span></span><span class=""mjx-texatom""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">θ</span></span></span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">)</span></span></span></span></span></span>. Indeed, we anthropomorphize so many things precisely because it is cheap for us to do so.)</p>
<p>Relatedly, I believe we already implicitly do this operationalization:  Suppose you talk to your favorite human <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""H""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.057em;"">H</span></span></span></span></span></span> about agency. <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""H""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.057em;"">H</span></span></span></span></span></span> will likely subconsciously associate agency with certain architectures, maybe such as those in Example 1.1-3. Moreover, <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""H""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.057em;"">H</span></span></span></span></span></span> will ascribe varying degrees of agency to different architectures --- for me, 1.3 seems more agenty than 1.1.

Indeed, we humans seem very agenty but, at the same time, determinism implies that there exists some hard-coded behavior that we enact. A rock rolling downhill can be viewed as merely obeying the non-agenty laws of physics, but what if it ""wants to"" get as low as possible?
And, as a result, we sometimes go ""Humans are definitely agents, and rocks are definitely non-agents...although, wait, are they?"".</p>
<h1>If we ban the concept of agency, which interesting problems remain?</h1>
<p>""Agency"" often comes up when discussing various alignment-related topics, such as the following:</p>
<h2>Optimizer?</h2>
<p>How do we detect whether <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""X""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.024em;"">X</span></span></span></span></span></span> performs (or capable of performing) optimization? How to detect this from <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""X""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.024em;"">X</span></span></span></span></span></span>'s architecture (or causal origin) rather than looking at its behavior? (This seems central to the topic of mesa-optimization.)</p>
<h2>Agent-like behavior vs agent-like architecture</h2>
<p>Consider the following <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/osxNg6yBCJ4ur9hpi/does-agent-like-behavior-imply-agent-like-architecture"">conjecture</a>: ""Suppose some <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""X""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.024em;"">X</span></span></span></span></span></span> exhibits agent-like behavior. Does it follow that <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""X""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.024em;"">X</span></span></span></span></span></span> physically contains agent-like architecture, such as the one from Example 1.2?"". This conjecture is false --- as an example, Q-learning is a ""fairly agenty"" architecture that leads to intelligent behavior. However, the resulting RL ""agent"" has a fixed policy and thus functions as a large look-up table. A better question would thus be whether there exist an agent-like architecture <em>causally upstream</em> of <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""X""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.024em;"">X</span></span></span></span></span></span>. This question also has a negative answer, as witnessed by the example of an ant colony --- agent-like behavior without agent-like architecture, produced by a ""non-agenty"" optimization process of evolution. Nonetheless, a general version of the question remains: If some <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""X""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.024em;"">X</span></span></span></span></span></span> exhibits agent-like behavior, does it follow that there exists some interesting physical structure<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-DMokvYT8MCjBikrnE-4"" id=""fnref-DMokvYT8MCjBikrnE-4"">[4]</a></sup> causally upstream of <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""X""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.024em;"">X</span></span></span></span></span></span>?<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-DMokvYT8MCjBikrnE-5"" id=""fnref-DMokvYT8MCjBikrnE-5"">[5]</a></sup></p>

On the other hand, if we gave it access to the internet<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-DMokvYT8MCjBikrnE-6"" id=""fnref-DMokvYT8MCjBikrnE-6"">[6]</a></sup>, it wouldn't do anything with it. The same cannot be said for humans and unaligned AGIs, who would not only be able to orient in this new environment but would eagerly execute elaborate plans to increase their influence. How can we tell whether some <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""X""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.024em;"">X</span></span></span></span></span></span> is more like the former or the latter?</p>
<p><strong>To summarize</strong>, I believe that many arguments and confusions surrounding agency can disappear if we explicitly use <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""A(\Theta)""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">A</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">(</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">Θ</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">)</span></span></span></span></span></span>-morphization. This should allow us to focus on the problems listed above.
Most definitions I gave are either semi-formal or informal, but I believe they could be made fully formal in more specific cases.</p>
<p>Regarding feedback:
Sugestions for a better name for ""<span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""A(\Theta)""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">A</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">(</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">Θ</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">)</span></span></span></span></span></span>-morphization"" super-welcome!
If you know of an application for which such formalization would be useful, please do let me know.
Pointing out places where you expect a useful formalization to be impossible is also welcome.</p>

If an early logical optimiser produces a paperclip maximiser, then the paperclip maximiser will play along giving good solutions to most logical optimisation problems, but hiding nasty surprises where we are likely to find them. In other words, you have risks of algorithms that give outputs that are pretty well logically optimized, but are also optimized to harm you somehow. Even if the first algorithm isn&apos;t like this, it could stumble upon an algorithm like this in the self improvement stage.</p><p>END EDIT</p><p>Epistemic status: I think the basic Idea is more likely than not sound.

BKM8uQS6QdJPZLqCr,Towards a mechanistic understanding of corrigibility,towards-a-mechanistic-understanding-of-corrigibility,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/BKM8uQS6QdJPZLqCr/towards-a-mechanistic-understanding-of-corrigibility,2019-08-22T23:20:57.134Z,47,21,26,False,False,,"<h2>Acceptability</h2>
<p>To be able to use something like <a href=""https://ai-alignment.com/training-robust-corrigibility-ce0e0a3b9b4d"">relaxed adversarial training</a> to verify a model, a necessary condition is having a good notion of <em>acceptability.</em> <a href=""https://ai-alignment.com/training-robust-corrigibility-ce0e0a3b9b4d"">Paul Christiano describes the following two desiderata for any notion of acceptability</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>""As long as the model <em>always</em> behaves acceptably, and achieves a high reward <em>on average,</em> we can be happy.""</li>
<li>""Requiring a model to always behave acceptably wouldn't make a hard problem too much harder.""</li>
</ol>
<p>While these are good conditions that any notion of acceptability must satisfy, there may be many different possible acceptability predicates that meet both of these conditions—how do we distinguish between them? Two additional major conditions that I use for evaluating different acceptability criteria are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>It must be not that hard for an amplified overseer to verify that a model is acceptable.</li>
<li>It must be not that hard to find such an acceptable model during training.</li>
</ol>
<p>These conditions are different than Paul's second condition in that they are statements about the ease of training an acceptable model rather than the ease of choosing an acceptable action. If you want to be able to do some form of informed oversight to produce an acceptable model, however, these are some of the most important conditions to pay attention to. Thus, I generally think about choosing an acceptability condition as trying to answer the question: <em>what is the easiest-to-train-and-verify property such that all models that satisfy that property<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-kH4bWiak9hqgNmrn4-1"" id=""fnref-kH4bWiak9hqgNmrn4-1"">[1]</a></sup> (and achieve high average reward) are safe?</em></p>
<h2>Act-Based Corrigibility</h2>
<p>One possible candidate property that Paul has proposed is <a href=""https://ai-alignment.com/corrigibility-3039e668638"">act-based corrigibility</a>, wherein an agent respects our short-term preferences, including those over how the agent itself should be modified. Not only is such an agent corrigible, Paul argues, but it will also want to make itself more corrigible, since having it be more corrigible is a component of our short-term preferences (Paul calls this the ""broad basin"" of corrigibility). While such act-based corrigibility would definitely be a nice property to have, it's unclear how exactly an amplified overseer could go about verifying such a property. In particular, if we want to verify such a property, we need a <em>mechanistic</em> understanding of act-based corrigibility rather than a <em>behavioral</em> one, since behavioral properties can only be verified by testing every input, whereas mechanistic properties can be verified just by inspecting the model.</p>
<p>One possible mechanistic understanding of corrigibility is <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/r9tYkB2a8Fp4DN8yB/p/zthDPAjh9w6Ytbeks""><em>corrigible alignment</em></a> as described in ""<a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01820"">Risks from Learned Optimization</a>,"" which is defined as the situation in which ""the base objective is incorporated into the mesa-optimizer's epistemic model and [the mesa-optimizer's] objective is modified to 'point to' that information."" While this gives us a starting point for understanding what a corrigible model might actually look like, there are still a bunch of missing pieces that have to be filled in. Furthermore, this notion of corrigibility looks more like <a href=""https://ai-alignment.com/corrigibility-3039e668638"">instrumental corrigibility rather than act-based corrigibility</a>, which as Paul notes is significantly less likely to be robust. Mechanistically, we can think of this lack of robustness as coming from the fact that ""pointing"" to the base objective is a pretty unstable operation: if you point even a little bit incorrectly, you'll end up with some sort of corrigible pseudo-alignment rather than corrigible robust alignment.</p>
<p>We can make this model more act-based, and at least somewhat mitigate this robustness problem, however, if we imagine pointing to only the human's short-term preferences. The hope for this sort of a setup is that, as long as the initial pointer is ""good enough,"" there will be pressure for the mesa-optimizer to make its pointer better in the way in which its current understanding of short-term human preferences recommends, which is exactly Paul's ""broad basin"" of corrigibility argument. This requires it to be not that hard, however, to find a model with a notion of the human's short-term preferences as opposed to their long-term preferences that is also willing to correct that notion based on feedback.</p>
<p>In particular, it needs to be the case that it is not that hard to find an agent which will correct mistakes in its own prior over what the human's short-term preferences are. From a naive Bayesian perspective, this seems unlikely, as it seems strange for an agent to be incentivized to change its own prior. However, this is actually a very natural state for an agent to be in: if I trust your beliefs about X more than I trust my own, then that means I would endorse a modification of my prior to match yours. In the context of act-based corrigibility, we can think about this from a mechanistic perspective as having a <a href=""http://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/prior.pdf""><em>pre-prior</em></a> that encodes a belief that the human prior over human short-term preferences is to be preferred. Furthermore, pre-priors are generally epistemically valuable for agents to have, as a pre-prior can encourage an agent to correct its own cognitive biases. Thus, agents with pre-priors should be incentivized by most training processes, and thus shouldn't be too difficult to find.</p>
<h2>Indifference Corrigibility</h2>
<p>Instrumental and act-based corrigibility are not the only forms of corrigibility that have been discussed in the literature, however: there's also <a href=""https://intelligence.org/files/Corrigibility.pdf""><em>indifference corrigibility</em></a>, wherein the agent is indifferent to modifications the human might make to it such as shutting it off. While this form of corrigibility doesn't in and of itself guarantee acceptability, if you had a way of verifying indifference corrigibility, there might be ways to turn that back into act-based corrigibility.</p>
<p>First, however, if we want to be able to verify indifference corrigibility, we are going to need a mechanistic understanding of it. Let's suppose we accept <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/r9tYkB2a8Fp4DN8yB/p/q2rCMHNXazALgQpGH"">the argument that a competitive model will likely be a mesa-optimizer</a> such that it will be running some sort of optimization process coupled with some sort of mesa-objective. Furthermore, let's suppose that its optimization process is computed over some sort of world model, which I think is a reasonable assumption for any competitive mesa-optimizer that wants to be able to take actions in the world. In such a case, we can think of indifference corrigibility as a form of <a href=""https://scelesticsiva.github.io/2018/01/22/stop-gradients/"">stop gradient</a> in the mesa-optimizer's world model which its optimization process doesn't optimize through,<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-kH4bWiak9hqgNmrn4-2"" id=""fnref-kH4bWiak9hqgNmrn4-2"">[2]</a></sup> which is a highly mechanistic property that we might expect an amplified overseer to be able to verify.</p>
<p>Again, however, we need agents with stop gradients to form a natural enough class such that they are not that hard to find. While it might naively seem as if agents with stop gradients would be very rare, in fact the exact opposite might be the case. Consider an agent such as the mesa-optimizer described previously which is running an optimization process over some world model, but which has preferences over the state of the world rather than the state of its world model. Such an agent will have an incentive to keep its world model aligned with the world, but only in one direction: it will want to modify its world model to match the world, but not modify the world to match its world model. This is a type of stop gradient, as it is a restriction on the agent to only minimize the difference between its world model and the world through one pathway but not through another. This example seems to suggest that stop gradients aren't that uncommon among agents such that it might be fairly achievable to find such an agent.</p>
<p>Even if we can train and verify indifference corrigibility, however, one of the big remaining problems with such an approach is that an indifference corrigible mesa-optimizer might do search in such a way that it finds a policy which is not itself indifference corrigible. We can think about this problem as arising from the fact that indifference corrigibility doesn't <a href=""https://intelligence.org/files/TilingAgentsDraft.pdf"">tile</a>, though I more often think of this problem as the problem of ""forwarding the guarantee,"" wherein even if we know how to do safe search on the outside, we have to make sure that any search inside of our model is similarly safe as well. This is a particularly interesting type of inner alignment problem in that, rather than being about how to ensure that a mesa-optimizer's objective is aligned, it is about how to ensure that a mesa-optimizer's search is safe even given that its objective is aligned. However, it seems plausible that this sort of problem could be resolved by ensuring that the model has a meta-preference towards any policies it produces also respecting the same stop gradient. In particular, the overseer could verify that any search over policies done by the model enforce the constraint that every policy have such a stop gradient.</p>
<p>Even once we can verify that our model is indifference corrigible and that it will forward that guarantee to any other search it might perform, however, there is still the question of how we might be able to use such a mechanism to produce a safe system. One way in which indifference corrigibility could be used to produce safety is to enforce that our model behave <em>myopically.</em> We can think of a myopic agent as one that only considers how best to answer the single question that you give to it rather than considering any sort of long-term consequences, which can be implemented as a stop gradient preventing any optimization outside of that domain. While myopia on its own is still insufficient to guarantee acceptability, it seems like it would at least prevent <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/r9tYkB2a8Fp4DN8yB/p/zthDPAjh9w6Ytbeks""><em>deceptive alignment</em></a>, as one of the conditions for deceptive alignment is that the mesa-optimizer must have something to gain from cooperating now and then defecting later, which is not true for a myopic agent. Thus, if directed at a task which we are confident is outer aligned, such as pure supervised amplification (training a model to approximate a human consulting that model), and combined with a scheme for preventing standard pseudo-alignment (such as adversarial training), myopia verification might be sufficient to resolve the rest of the inner alignment problem by preventing deceptive alignment.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>If we want to be able to do <a href=""https://ai-alignment.com/training-robust-corrigibility-ce0e0a3b9b4d"">relaxed adversarial training</a> to produce safe AI systems, we are going to need a notion of acceptability which is not that hard to train and verify. Corrigibility seems to be one of the most promising candidates for such an acceptability condition, but for that to work we need a mechanistic understanding of exactly what sort of corrigibility we're shooting for and how it will ensure safety. I think that both of the paths considered here—both act-based corrigibility and indifference corrigibility—look like promising research directions for attacking this problem.</p>

6pZzsSFkwkz74CBrr,Response to Glen Weyl on Technocracy and the Rationalist Community,response-to-glen-weyl-on-technocracy-and-the-rationalist,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6pZzsSFkwkz74CBrr/response-to-glen-weyl-on-technocracy-and-the-rationalist,2019-08-22T23:14:58.690Z,66,23,9,False,False,,"<p>Economist Glen Weyl has written a <a href=""https://radicalxchange.org/blog/posts/2019-08-19-bv61r6/"">long essay</a>, ""Why I Am Not A Technocrat"", a major focus of which is his differences with the rationalist community.</p>
<p>I feel like I've read a decent number of outsider critiques of the rationalist community at this point, and Glen's critique is pretty good.  It has the typical outsider critique weakness of not being fully familiar with the subject of its criticism, balanced by the strength of seeing the rationalist community from a perspective we're less familiar with.</p>
<p>As I was reading Glen's essay, I took some quick notes.  Afterwards I turned them into this post.</p>
<h1>Glen's Strongest Points</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>The fundamental problem with technocracy on which I will focus (as it is most easily understood within the technocratic worldview) is that formal systems of knowledge creation always have their limits and biases. They always leave out important consideration that are only discovered later and that often turn out to have a systematic relationship to the limited cultural and social experience of the groups developing them. They are thus subject to a wide range of failure modes that can be interpreted as reflecting on a mixture of corruption and incompetence of the technocratic elite. Only systems that leave a wide range of latitude for broader social input can avoid these failure modes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So far, this sounds a lot like discussions I've seen previously of the book <em>Seeing Like a State</em>.  But here's where Glen goes further:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yet allowing such social input requires simplification, distillation, collaboration and a relative reduction in the social status and monetary rewards allocated to technocrats compared to the rest of the population, thereby running directly against the technocratic ideology. While technical knowledge, appropriately communicated and distilled, has potentially great benefits in opening social imagination, it can only achieve this potential if it understands itself as part of a broader democratic conversation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Technical insights and designs are best able to avoid this problem when, whatever their analytic provenance, they can be conveyed in a simple and clear way to the public, allowing them to be critiqued, recombined, and deployed by a variety of members of the public outside the technical class.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Technical experts therefore have a critical role precisely if they can make their technical insights part of a social and democratic conversation that stretches well beyond the role for democratic participation imagined by technocrats. Ensuring this role cannot be separated from the work of design.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[When] insulation is severe, even a deeply “well-intentioned” technocratic class is likely to have severe failures along the corruption dimension. Such a class is likely to develop a strong culture of defending its distinctive class expertise and status and will be insulated from external concerns about the justification for this status.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Market designers have, over the last 30 years designed auctions, school choice mechanisms, medical matching procedures, and other social institutions using tools like auction and matching theory, adapted to a variety of specific institutional settings by economic consultants. While the principles they use have an appearance of objectivity and fairness, they play out against the contexts of societies wildly different than those described in the models. Matching theory uses principles of justice intended to apply to an entire society as a template for designing the operation of a particular matching mechanism within, for example, a given school district, thereby in practice primarily shutting down crucial debates about desegregation, busing, taxes, and other actions needed to achieve educational fairness with a semblance of formal truth. Auction theory, based on static models without product market competition and with absolute private property rights and assuming no coordination of behavior across bidders, is used to design auctions to govern the incredibly dynamic world of spectrum allocation, creating holdout problems, reducing competition, and creating huge payouts for those able to coordinate to game the auctions, often themselves market design experts friendly with the designers. The complexities that arise in the process serve to make such mass-scale privatizations, often primarily to the benefit of these connected players and at the expense of the taxpayer, appear the “objectively” correct and politically unimpeachable solution.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Mechanism] designers must explicitly recognize and design for the fact that there is critical information necessary to make their designs succeed that a) lies in the minds of citizens outside the technocratic/designer class, b) will not be translated into the language of this class soon enough to avoid disastrous outcomes and c) does not fit into the thin formalism that designers allow for societal input.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In order to allow these failures to be corrected, it will be necessary for the designed system to be comprehensible by those outside the formal community, so they can incorporate the unformalized information through critique, reuse, recombination and broader conversation in informal language. Let us call this goal “legibility”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There will in general be a trade-off between fidelity and legibility, just as both will have to be traded off against optimality. Systems that are true to the world will tend to become complicated and thus illegible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Democratic designers thus must constantly attend, on equal footing, in teams or individually, to both the technical and communicative aspects of their work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Please let me know if you think I left out something critical)</p>
<p>A <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27s_Law"">famous quote</a> about open source software development states that ""given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow"".

There were the Heartbleed and goto fail bugs which existed for, IIRC, a few years before they were discovered. Not surprising, because TLS code is generally some of the worst code on the planet to stare at all day.""</p>
<p>In other words, if you want critical feedback on your open source project, it's not enough just to put it out there and have lots of users.  You also want to make the source code as <a href=""https://geoff.greer.fm/2012/01/20/building-for-others/"">accessible as possible</a>--and this may mean compromising on other aspects of the design.</p>
<p>Academic or other in-group status games may encourage the use of <a href=""https://stevenpinker.com/files/pinker/files/why_academics_stink_at_writing.pdf"">big words</a>.  But we'd be better off rewarding simple explanations--not only are simple explanations more accessible, they also demonstrate <a href=""https://kottke.org/17/06/if-you-cant-explain-something-in-simple-terms-you-dont-understand-it"">deeper understanding</a>.  If we appreciated simplicity properly:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We'd incentivize the creation of more simple explanations, promoting accessibility.  And people wouldn't dismiss simple explanations for being ""too obvious"".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Intellectuals would realize that even if a simple idea required lots of effort to discover, it need not require lots of effort to grasp.  Verification is much quicker than search.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>At the very least, I think, Glen wants our institutions to be like <a href=""https://smile.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Think-Revisited-Usability-ebook/dp/B00HJUBRPG/"">highly usable software</a>: The internals require expertise to create and understand, but from a user's perspective, it ""just works"" and does what you expect.</p>
<p>Another point Glen makes well is that just because you are in the institution design business does not mean you're immune to incentives.  The importance of self-skepticism regarding one's own incentives has been <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/v8rghtzWCziYuMdJ5/why-does-power-corrupt"">discussed</a> <a href=""https://equilibriabook.com"">before</a> around here, but <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xhE4TriBSPywGuhqi/integrity-and-accountability-are-core-parts-of-rationality"">this recent post</a> probably comes closes to Glen's position, that you really can't be trusted to monitor yourself.</p>
<p>Finally, Glen talks about the insularity of the rationalist community itself.  I think this critique was true in the past.  I haven't been interacting with the community in person as much over the past few years, so I hesitate to talk about the present, but I think he's plausibly right.  I also think there may be an interesting counterargument that the rationalist community does a better job of integrating perspectives across multiple disciplines than your average academic department.</p>
<h1>Possible Points of Disagreement</h1>
<p>Although I think Glen would find some common ground with the <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xhE4TriBSPywGuhqi/integrity-and-accountability-are-core-parts-of-rationality"">recent post</a> I linked, it's possible he would also find points of disagreement.  In particular, habryka writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Highlighting accountability as a variable also highlights one of the biggest error modes of accountability and integrity – choosing too broad of an audience to hold yourself accountable to.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There is tradeoff between the size of the group that you are being held accountable by, and the complexity of the ethical principles you can act under. Too large of an audience, and you will be held accountable by the lowest common denominator of your values, which will rarely align well with what you actually think is moral (if you've done any kind of real reflection on moral principles).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Too small or too memetically close of an audience, and you risk not enough people paying attention to what you do, to actually help you notice inconsistencies in your stated beliefs and actions. And, the smaller the group that is holding you accountable is, the smaller your inner circle of trust, which reduces the amount of total resources that can be coordinated under your shared principles.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I think a major mistake that even many well-intentioned organizations make is to try to be held accountable by some vague conception of ""the public"". As they make public statements, someone in the public will misunderstand them, causing a spiral of less communication, resulting in more misunderstandings, resulting in even less communication, culminating into an organization that is completely opaque about any of its actions and intentions, with the only communication being filtered by a PR department that has little interest in the observers acquiring any beliefs that resemble reality.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I think a generally better setup is to choose a much smaller group of people that you trust to evaluate your actions very closely, and ideally do so in a way that is itself transparent to a broader audience. Common versions of this are auditors, as well as nonprofit boards that try to ensure the integrity of an organization.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Common wisdom is that it's impossible to please everyone.  And <a href=""https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a20630"">specialization of labor</a> is a foundational principle of modern society.  If I took my role as a member of ""the public"" seriously and tried to provide meaningful and fair accountability to everyone, I wouldn't have time to do anything else.</p>
<p>It's interesting that Glen talks up the value of ""legibility"", because from what I understand, <em>Seeing Like a State</em> emphasizes its <a href=""https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2010/07/26/a-big-little-idea-called-legibility/"">disadvantages</a>.  <em>Seeing Like a State</em> discusses legibility in the eyes of state administrators, but Glen doesn't explain why we shouldn't expect similar failure modes when ""the general public"" is substituted for ""state administration"".</p>
<p>(It's possible that Glen doesn't mean ""legibility"" in the same sense the book does, and a different term like ""institutional legibility"" would pinpoint what he's getting at.  But there's still the question of whether we should expect optimizing for ""institutional legibility"" to be risk-free, after having observed that ""societal legibility"" has downsides.  Glen seems to interpret recent political events as a result of excess technocracy, but they could also be seen as a result of excess populism--a leader's <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/pow.html"">charisma</a> could be more ""legible"" to the public than their competence.)</p>
<p>Anyway, I assume Glen is aware of these issues and working to solve them.  I'm no expert, but from what I've heard of RadicalxChange, it seems like a really cool project.  I'll offer my own uninformed outsider's perspective on institution design, in the hope that the conceptual raw material will prove useful to him or others.</p>
<h1>My Take on Institution Design</h1>
<p>I think there's another model which does a decent job of explaining the data Glen provides:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Human systems are complicated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Greed finds &amp; exploits flaws in institutions, causing them to decay over time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are no silver bullets.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>From the perspective of this model, Glen's emphasis on legibility could be seen as yet another purported silver bullet.  However, I don't see a compelling reason for it to succeed where previous bullets failed.  How, concretely, are random folks like me supposed to help address the corruption Glen identifies in the wireless spectrum allocation process?  There seems to be a bit of a disconnect between Glen's description of the problem and his description of the solution.  (Later Glen mentions the value of ""humanities, continental philosophy, or humanistic social sciences""--I'd be interested to hear specific ideas from these areas, which aren't commonly known, that he thinks are quite important &amp; relevant for institution design purposes.)</p>
<p>As a recent &amp; related example, a decade or two ago many people were talking about how the Internet would revitalize &amp; strengthen democracy; nowadays I'd guess most would <a href=""https://www.technologyreview.com/s/611805/the-four-ways-that-ex-internet-idealists-explain-where-it-all-went-wrong/"">agree</a> that the Internet has failed as a silver bullet in this regard.  (In fact, sometimes I get the impression this is the only thing we can all agree on!)</p>
<p>Anyway... What do I think we should we do?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>All untested institution designs have flaws.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The challenge of institution design is to identify &amp; fix flaws as cheaply as possible, ideally before the design goes into production.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Under this framework, it's not enough merely to have the approval of a large number of people.  If these people have similar perspectives, their inability to identify flaws offers limited evidence about the overall robustness of the design.</p>
<p>Legibility is useful for flaw discovery in this framework, just as cleaner code could've been useful for surfacing flaws like Heartbleed.  But there are other strategies available too, like offering <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bug_bounty_program"">bug</a> <a href=""https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/jwZhhpyZXahkogbkJ/how-do-we-check-for-flaws-in-effective-altruism#JNgXt5uscuBoKd9HY"">bounties</a> for the best available critiques.</p>
<p>Experiments and <a href=""http://www.overcomingbias.com/2019/03/best-cause-new-mechanism-field-trials.html"">field trials</a> are a bit more expensive, but it's critical to actually try things out, and resolve disagreements among bug bounty participants.  Then there's the ""resume-building"" stage of trialing one's institution on an increasingly large scale in the real world.  I'd argue one should aim to have all the kinks worked out before ""resume-building"" starts, but of course, it's important to monitor the roll-out for problems which might emerge--and ideally, the institution should itself have means with which it can be patched ""in production"" (which should get tested during experimentation &amp; field trials).</p>
<p>The process I just described could itself be seen as an untested institution which is probably flawed and needs critiques, experiments, and field testing.  (For example, bug bounties don't do anything on their own for legibility--how can we incentivize the production of clear explanations of the institution design in need of critiques?)  Taking everything meta, and designing an institutional framework for introducing new institutions, is the real silver bullet if you ask me :-)</p>
<h1>Probable Points of Disagreement</h1>
<p>Given Glen's belief in the difficulty of knowledge creation, the importance of local knowledge, and the limitations of outside perspectives, I hope he won't be upset to learn that I think he got a few things wrong about the rationalist community.  (I also think he got some things wrong about the EA community, but I believe he's working to fix those issues, so I won't address them.)</p>
<p>Glen writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>if we want to have AIs that can play a productive role in society, our goal should not be exclusively or even primarily to align them with the goals of their creators or the narrow rationalist community interested in the AIAP.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This doesn't appear to be a difference of opinion with the rationalist community.  In Eliezer's CEV <a href=""https://intelligence.org/files/CEV.pdf"">paper</a>, he writes about the ""coherent extrapolated volition of humankind"", not the ""coherent extrapolated volition of the rationalist community"".</p>
<p>However, now that MIRI's research is non-disclosed by default, I wonder if it would be wise for them to publicly state that their research is for the benefit of all, in a charter like OpenAI has, rather than in a paper published in 2004.</p>
<p>Glen writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The institutions likely to achieve [constraints on an AI's power] are precisely the same sorts of institutions necessary to constrain extreme capitalist or state power.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An unaligned superintelligent AI which can build advanced nanotechnology has no need to follow human laws.  On the flip side, an aligned superintelligent AI can design better institutions for aggregating our knowledge &amp; preferences than any human could.</p>
<p>Glen writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A primary goal of AI design should be not just alignment, but legibility, to ensure that the humans interacting with the AI know its goals and failure modes, allowing critique, reuse, constraint etc. Such a focus, while largely alien to research on AI and on AIAP</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This actually appears to me to be one of the primary goals of AI alignment research.  See 2.3 in <a href=""https://intelligence.org/files/AlignmentMachineLearning.pdf"">this paper</a> or <a href=""https://intelligence.org/2018/10/03/rocket-alignment/"">this parable</a>.  It's not alien to mainstream AI research either: see research on explainability and interpretability (pro tip: <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-019-0048-x.epdf?author_access_token=SU_TpOb-H5d3uy5KF-dedtRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0M3t8uDwhDckroSbUOOygdba5KNHQMo_Ji2D1_SdDjVr6hjgxJXc-7jt5FQZuPTQKIAkZsBoTI4uqjwnzbltD01Z8QwhwKsbvwh-z1xL8bAcg%3D%3D"">interpretability is better</a>).</p>
<p>In any case, if the alignment problem is <em>actually</em> solved, legibility isn't needed, because we know exactly what the system's goals are: The goals we gave it.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>As I said previously, I have not investigated RadicalxChange in very much depth, but my superficial impression is that it is really cool.  I think it could be an extremely high leverage project in a world where AGI doesn't come for a while, or gets invented slowly over time.  My personal focus is on scenarios where AGI is invented relatively rapidly relatively soon, but sometimes I wonder whether I should focus on the kind of work Glen does.  In any case, I am rooting for him, and I hope his movement does an astonishing job of inventing and popularizing nearly flawless institution designs.</p>

The difference between someone who does understand calculus and someone who does not, is the difference between someone <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Gg9a4y8reWKtLe3Tn/the-rocket-alignment-problem"">who can build a rocket and someone who cannot</a>.

An idea I've heard is that if a culture is easily able to reach technologically maturity, it will come later than a culture who is barely able to become technologically maturity, because evolution works over much longer time scales than culture + technological innovation. As such, if you observe yourself to be in a culture that is able to reach technologically maturity, you're probably ""the stupidest such culture that could get there, because if it could be done at a stupider level then it would've happened there first.""</p><p>As such, we're a species whereby if we try as hard as we can, if we take brains optimised for social coordination and make them do math, then we can just about reach technical maturity (i.e. build nanotech, AI, etc). </p><p>That may be true, but the question I want to ask about is what is it about humans, culture and brains that allows for such high variance within the species, that isn't true about mice and chimps? Something about this is still confusing to me. Like, if it is the case that some humans are able to do great feats of engineering like build rockets that land, and some aren't, what's the difference between these humans that causes such massive changes in outcome? Because, as above, it's not some big complex genetic adaptation some have and some don't. I think we're all running pretty similar genetic code.</p><p>Is there some simple amount of working memory that's required to do complex recursion? Like, 6 working memory slots makes things way harder than 7?</p><p>I can imagine that there are many hacks, and not a single thing. I'm reminded of the story of Richard Feynman learning to count time, where he'd practice being able to count a whole minute. He'd do it while doing the laundry, while cooking breakfast, and so on. He later met the mathematician John Tukey, who could do the same, but they had some fierce disagreements. Tukey said you couldn't do it while reading the newspaper, and Feynman said he could. Feynman said you couldn't do it while having a conversation, and Tukey said they could. They then both surprised each other by doing exactly what they said they could.</p><p>It turned out Feynman was <em>hearing</em> numbers being spoken, whereas Tukey was <em>visualising </em>the numbers ticking over. So Feynman could still read at the same time, and his friend could still listen and talk.</p><p>The idea here is that if you're unable to use one type of cognitive resource, you may make up for it with another. This is probably the same situation as when you make trade-offs between space and time in computational complexity.</p><p>So I can imagine different humans finding different hacky ways to build up the skill to do very abstract truth-tracking thinking. Perhaps you have a little less working memory than average, but you have a great capacity for visualisation, and primarily work in areas that lend themselves to geometric / spacial thinking. Or perhaps your culture can be very conducive to abstract thought in some way.</p><p>But even if this is right I'm interested in the details of what the key variables actually are.</p><p>What are your thoughts?</p><hr class=""dividerBlock""><p>[1] Note: humans can <em>lack</em> <a href=""https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Phineas_Gage"">important pieces of machinery</a>.</p>",Benito,benito,Ben Pace,

The obvious question is: how are paradoxes prevented?</p><p>We may not have any idea how paradoxes are prevented, but presumably there must be <em>some</em> prevention mechanism. So, in a purely Bayesian sense, we can condition on paradoxes somehow not happening, and then ask what becomes more or less likely. In general, anything which would make a time machine more likely to be built should become less likely, and anything which would prevent a time machine being built should become more likely.</p><p>In other words: if we&#x27;re trying to do something which would make time machines more likely to be built, this argument says that we should expect things to mysteriously go wrong.</p><p>For instance, let&#x27;s say we&#x27;re trying to build some kind of powerful optimization process which might find time machines instrumentally useful for some reason. To the extent that such a process is likely to build time machines and induce paradoxes, we would expect things to mysteriously go wrong when trying to build the optimizer in the first place.</p><p>On the flip side: we could commit to designing our powerful optimization process so that it not only avoids building time machines, but also actively prevents time machines from being built. Then the mysterious force should work in our favor: we would expect things to mysteriously go well. We don&#x27;t need time-travel-prevention to be the optimization process&#x27; sole objective here, it just needs to make time machines sufficiently less likely to get an overall drop in the probability of paradox.</p>",johnswentworth,johnswentworth,johnswentworth,

(My actual motivation for writing this is to make it so that I don&#x27;t feel as much like I need to defend myself when I use this technique.) I am calling it intentional bucket errors after a CFAR concept called <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/EEv9JeuY5xfuDDSgF/flinching-away-from-truth-is-often-about-protecting-the"">bucket errors</a>. Bucket errors is about noticing when multiple different concepts/questions are stored in your head as a single concept/question. Then, by noticing this, you can think about the different concepts/question separately.</p><h2>What are Intentional Bucket Errors</h2><p>Bucket errors are normally thought of as a bad thing. It has &quot;errors&quot; right in the name. However, I want to argue that bucket errors can sometimes be useful, and you might want to consider having some bucket errors on purpose. You can do this by taking multiple different concepts and just pretending that they are all the same. This usually only works if the concepts started out sufficiently close together.</p><p>Like many techniques that work by acting as though you believe something false, you should use this technique responsibly. The goal is to pretend that the concepts are the same to help you gain traction on thinking about them, but then to also be able to go back to inhabiting the world where they are actually different.</p><h2>Why Use Intentional Bucket Errors</h2><p>Why might you want to use intentional bucket errors? For one, maybe the concepts actually are the same, but they look different enough that you won&#x27;t let yourself consider the possibility. I think this is especially likely to happen if the concepts are coming from very different fields or areas of your life. Sometimes it feels silly to draw strong connections between e.g. human rationality, AI alignment, evolution, economics, etc. but such connections can be useful. </p><p>Also I find this useful for gaining traction. There is something useful about constrained optimization for being able to start thinking about a problem. Sometimes it is harder to say something true and useful about X than it is to say something true and useful that simultaneously applies to X, Y, and Z. This is especially true when the concepts you are conflating are imagined solutions to problems. </p><p>For example, maybe I have an imagined solution to counterfactuals that has a hole in it that looks like understanding multi-level world models. Then, maybe I also have have an imagined solution to tiling that also has a hole in it that looks like understanding multi-level world models. I could view this as two separate problems. The desired properties of my MLWM theory for counterfactuals might be different from the desired properties for tiling. I have these two different holes I want to fill, and one strategy I have, which superficially looks like it makes the problem harder, is to try to find something that can fill both holes simultaneously. However, this can sometimes be easier because different use cases can help you triangulate the simple theory from which the specific solutions can be derived.</p><p>A lighter (maybe epistemically safer) version of intentional bucket errors is just to pay a bunch of attention to the connections between the concepts. This has its own advantages in that the relationships between the concepts might be interesting. However, I personally prefer to just throw them all in together, since this way I only have to work with one object, and it takes up fewer working memory slots while I&#x27;m thinking about it.</p><h2>Examples</h2><p>Here are a some recent examples where I feel like I have used something like this, to varying degrees. </p><p><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/9CKBtxWtjvminNTmC/how-the-mtg-color-wheel-explains-ai-safety"">How the MtG Color Wheel Explains AI Safety</a> is obviously the product of conflating many things together without worrying too much about how all the clusters are wrong. </p><p>In <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/pcomQ4Fwi7FnfBZBR/how-does-gradient-descent-interact-with-goodhart"">How does Gradient Descent Interact with Goodhart</a>, the question at the top about rocket designs and human approval is really very different from the experiments that I suggested, but I feel like learning about one might help my intuitions about the other. This was actually generated at the same time as I was thinking about <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7YG9zknYE8di9PuFg/epistemic-tenure"">Epistemic Tenure</a>, which for me what partially about the expectation that there is good research and a correlated proxy of justifiable research, and even though our group idea selection mechanism is going to optimize for justifiable research, it is better if the inner optimization loops in the humans do not directly follow those incentives.

<pre><code>f(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n * f(n-1)
</code></pre>
<p>Let’s think about the process by which this function is evaluated. We want to sketch out a <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/hzuSDMx7pd2uxFc5w/causal-diagrams-and-causal-models"">causal DAG</a> showing all of the intermediate calculations and the connections between them (feel free to pause reading and try this yourself).</p>
<p>Here’s what the causal DAG looks like:</p>
<p><img src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mZy6AMgCw9CPjNCoK/bjrk22eoujtjuo8tm3vm"" alt=""""></p>
<p>Each dotted box corresponds to one call to the function f. The recursive call in f becomes a symmetry in the causal diagram: the DAG consists of an infinite sequence of copies of the same subcircuit.</p>
<p>More generally, we can represent any Turing-computable function this way. Just take some pseudocode for the function, and expand out the full causal DAG of the calculation. In general, the diagram will either be finite or have symmetric components - the symmetry is what allows us to use a finite representation even though the graph itself is infinite.</p>
<h2>Why would we want to do this?</h2>
<p>For our purposes, the central idea of embedded agency is to take these black-box systems which we call “agents”, and break open the black boxes to see what’s going on inside.</p>
<p>Causal DAGs with symmetry are how we do this for Turing-computable functions in general. They show the actual cause-and-effect process which computes the result; conceptually they represent the <em>computation</em> rather than a black-box <em>function</em>.</p>
<p>In particular, a causal DAG + symmetry representation gives us all the natural machinery of causality - most notably counterfactuals. We can ask questions like “what would happen if I reached in and flipped a bit at this point in the computation?” or “what value would f(5) return if f(3) were 11?”. We can pose these questions in a well-defined, unambiguous way without worrying about <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/BRuWm4GxcTNPn4XDX/deconfusing-logical-counterfactuals"">logical counterfactuals</a>, and without adding any additional machinery. This becomes particularly important for embedded optimization: if an “agent” (e.g. an organism) wants to plan ahead to achieve an objective (e.g. find food), it needs to ask counterfactual questions like “how much food would I find if I kept going straight?”.</p>
<p>The other main reason we would want to represent functions as causal DAGs with symmetry is because our universe <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/h6fzC6wFYFxxKDm8u/the-fabric-of-real-things"">appears to be one giant causal DAG</a> <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry_(physics)"">with symmetry</a>.</p>
<p>Because our universe is causal, any computation performed in our universe must eventually bottom out in a causal DAG. We can write our programs in any language we please, but eventually they will be compiled down to machine code and run by physical transistors made of atoms which are themselves governed by a causal DAG. In most cases, we can represent the causal computational process at a more abstract level - e.g. in our example program, even though we didn’t talk about registers or transistors or electric fields, the causal diagram we sketched out would still accurately represent the computation performed even at the lower levels.</p>
<p>This raises the issue of abstraction - the core problem of embedded agency. My own main use-case for the causal diagram + symmetry model of computation is formulating models of abstraction: how can one causal diagram (possibly with symmetry) represent another in a way which makes counterfactual queries on the map correspond to some kind of counterfactual on the territory? Can that work when the “map” is a subDAG of the territory DAG? It feels like causal diagrams + symmetry are the minimal computational model needed to get agency-relevant answers to this sort of question.</p>
<h2>Learning</h2>
<p>The traditional ultimate learning algorithm is <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Kolmogorov-Complexity-Applications-Computer/dp/3030112977/"">Solomonoff Induction</a>: take some black-box system which spews out data, and look for short programs which reproduce that data. But the phrase “black-box” suggests that perhaps we could do better by looking inside that box.</p>
<p>To make this a little bit more concrete: imagine I have some python program running on a server which responds to http requests. Solomonoff Induction would look at the data returned by requests to the program, and learn to predict the program’s behavior. But that sort of black-box interaction is not the only option. The program is running on a physical server somewhere - so, in principle, we could go grab a screwdriver and a tiny oscilloscope and directly observe the computation performed by the physical machine. Even without measuring every voltage on every wire, we may at least get enough data to narrow down the space of candidate programs in a way which Solomonoff Induction could not do. Ideally, we’d gain enough information to avoid needing to search over all possible programs.</p>
<p>Compared to Solomonoff Induction, this process looks a lot more like how scientists actually study the real world in practice: there’s lots of taking stuff apart and poking at it to see what makes it tick.</p>
<p>In general, though, how to learn causal DAGs with symmetry is still an open question. We’d like something like Solomonoff Induction, but which can account for partial information about the internal structure of the causal DAG, rather than just overall input-output behavior. (In principle, we could shoehorn this whole thing into traditional Solomonoff Induction by treating information about the internal DAG structure as normal old data, but that doesn’t give us a good way to extract the learned DAG structure.)</p>
<p>We already have algorithms for learning causal structure in general. Pearl’s <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Causality-Reasoning-Inference-Judea-Pearl/dp/052189560X"">Causality</a> sketches out some such algorithms in chapter 2, although they’re only practical for either very small systems or very large amounts of data. Bayesian structure learning can handle larger systems with less data, though sometimes at the cost of a very large amount of compute - i.e. estimating high-dimensional integrals.</p>
<p>However, in general, these approaches don’t directly account for <em>symmetry</em> of the learned DAGs. Ideally, we would use a prior which weights causal DAGs according to the size of their representation - i.e. infinite DAGs would still have nonzero prior probability if they have some symmetry allowing for finite representation, and in general DAGs with multiple copies of the same sub-DAG would have higher probability. This isn’t quite the same as weighting by minimum description length in the Solomonoff sense, since we care specifically about symmetries which correspond to function calls - i.e. isomorphic subDAGs. We don’t care about graphs which can be generated by a short program but don’t have these sorts of symmetries. So that leaves the question: if our prior probability for a causal DAG is given by a notion of minimum description length which only allows compression by specifying re-used subcircuits, what properties will the resulting learning algorithm possess? Is it computable? What kinds of data are needed to make it tractable?</p>

Apply by September 6.</p><p><u><a href=""http://gradientscience.org/adv/"">Adversarial Examples Are Not Bugs, They Are Features</a></u> <em>(Andrew Ilyas, Shibani Santurkar, Dimitris Tsipras, Logan Engstrom et al) </em>(summarized by Rohin and Cody): <em>Distill published a discussion of this paper. This highlights section will cover the full discussion; all of these summaries and opinions are meant to be read together.</em></p><p>Consider two possible explanations of adversarial examples. First, they could be caused because the model &quot;hallucinates&quot; a signal that is not useful for classification, and it becomes very sensitive to this feature. We could call these &quot;bugs&quot;, since they don&#x27;t generalize well. Second, they could be caused by features that <em>do</em> generalize to the test set, but <em>can</em> be modified by an adversarial perturbation. We could call these &quot;non-robust features&quot; (as opposed to &quot;robust features&quot;, which can&#x27;t be changed by an adversarial perturbation). The authors argue that at least some adversarial perturbations fall into the second category of being informative but sensitive features, based on two experiments.</p><p>If the &quot;hallucination&quot; explanation were true, the hallucinations would presumably be caused by the training process, the choice of architecture, the size of the dataset, <strong>but not by the type of data</strong>. So one thing to do would be to see if we can construct a dataset such that a model trained on that dataset is <em>already</em> robust, without adversarial training. The authors do this in the first experiment. They take an adversarially trained robust classifier, and create images whose features (final-layer activations of the robust classifier) match the features of some unmodified input. The generated images only have robust features because the original classifier was robust, and in fact models trained on this dataset are automatically robust.</p><p>If the &quot;non-robust features&quot; explanation were true, then it should be possible for a model to learn on a dataset containing only non-robust features (which will look nonsensical to humans) and <strong>still generalize to a normal-looking test set</strong>. In the second experiment (henceforth WrongLabels), the authors construct such a dataset. Their hypothesis is that adversarial perturbations work by introducing non-robust features of the target class. So, to construct their dataset, they take an image x with original label y, adversarially perturb it towards some class y&#x27; to get image x&#x27;, and then add (x&#x27;, y&#x27;) to their dataset (even though to a human x&#x27; looks like class y). They have two versions of this: in RandLabels, the target class y&#x27; is chosen randomly, whereas in DetLabels, y&#x27; is chosen to be y + 1. For both datasets, if you train a new model on the dataset, you get good performance <strong>on the original test set</strong>, showing that the &quot;non-robust features&quot; do generalize.</p><p><strong>Rohin&#x27;s opinion:</strong> I buy this hypothesis. It&#x27;s a plausible explanation for brittleness towards adversarial noise (&quot;because non-robust features are useful to reduce loss&quot;), and why adversarial examples transfer across models (&quot;because different models can learn the same non-robust features&quot;). In fact, the paper shows that architectures that did worse in ExpWrongLabels (and so presumably are bad at learning non-robust features) are also the ones to which adversarial examples transfer the least. I&#x27;ll leave the rest of my opinion to the opinions on the responses.</p><p><strong>Read more:</strong> <u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02175"">Paper</a></u> and <u><a href=""https://distill.pub/2019/advex-bugs-discussion/original-authors/"">Author response</a></u></p><p><u><a href=""https://distill.pub/2019/advex-bugs-discussion/response-6/"">Response: Learning from Incorrectly Labeled Data</a></u> <em>(Eric Wallace)</em>: This response notes that all of the experiments are of the form: create a dataset D that is consistent with a model M; then, when you train a new model M&#x27; on D you get the same properties as M. Thus, we can interpret these experiments as showing that <u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02531"">model distillation</a></u> can work even with data points that we would naively think of &quot;incorrectly labeled&quot;. This is a more general phenomenon: we can take an MNIST model, select <em>only</em> the examples for which the top prediction is incorrect (labeled with these incorrect top predictions), and train a new model on that -- and get nontrivial performance on the original test set, even though the new model has never seen a &quot;correctly labeled&quot; example.</p><p><strong>Rohin&#x27;s opinion:</strong> I definitely agree that these results can be thought of as a form of model distillation. I don&#x27;t think this detracts from the main point of the paper: the <em>reason</em> model distillation works even with incorrectly labeled data is probably because the data is labeled in such a way that it incentivizes the new model to pick out the same features that the old model was paying attention to.</p><p><u><a href=""https://distill.pub/2019/advex-bugs-discussion/response-2/"">Response: Robust Feature Leakage</a></u> <em>(Gabriel Goh)</em>: This response investigates whether the datasets in WrongLabels could have had robust features. Specifically, it checks whether a linear classifier over provably robust features trained on the WrongLabels dataset can get good accuracy on the <em>original</em> test set. This shouldn&#x27;t be possible since WrongLabels is meant to correlate only non-robust features with labels. It finds that you <em>can</em> get some accuracy with RandLabels, but you don&#x27;t get much accuracy with DetLabels.</p><p>The original authors can actually explain this: intuitively, you get accuracy with RandLabels because it&#x27;s less harmful to choose labels randomly than to choose them explicitly incorrectly. With random labels on unmodified inputs, robust features should be completely uncorrelated with accuracy. However, with random labels <em>followed by an adversarial perturbation towards the label</em>, there can be some correlation, because the adversarial perturbation can add &quot;a small amount&quot; of the robust feature. However, in DetLabels, the labels are <em>wrong</em>, and so the robust features are <em>negatively correlated</em> with the true label, and while this can be reduced by an adversarial perturbation, it can&#x27;t be reversed (otherwise it wouldn&#x27;t be robust).</p><p><strong>Rohin&#x27;s opinion:</strong> The original authors&#x27; explanation of these results is quite compelling; it seems correct to me.</p><p><u><a href=""https://distill.pub/2019/advex-bugs-discussion/response-5/"">Response: Adversarial Examples are Just Bugs, Too</a></u> <em>(Preetum Nakkiran)</em>: The main point of this response is that adversarial examples can be bugs too. In particular, if you construct adversarial examples that explicitly <em>don&#x27;t</em> transfer between models, and then run ExpWrongLabels with such adversarial perturbations, then the resulting model doesn&#x27;t perform well on the original test set (and so it must not have learned non-robust features).</p><p>It also constructs a data distribution where <strong>every useful feature <em>of the optimal classifer</em> is guaranteed to be robust</strong>, and shows that we can still get adversarial examples with a typical model, showing that it is not just non-robust features that cause adversarial examples.</p><p>In their response, the authors clarify that they didn&#x27;t intend to claim that adversarial examples could not arise due to &quot;bugs&quot;, just that &quot;bugs&quot; were not the only explanation. In particular, they say that their main thesis is “adversarial examples will not just go away as we fix bugs in our models”, which is consistent with the point in this response.</p><p><strong>Rohin&#x27;s opinion:</strong> Amusingly, I think I&#x27;m more bullish on the original paper&#x27;s claims than the authors themselves. It&#x27;s certainly true that adversarial examples can arise from &quot;bugs&quot;: if your model overfits to your data, then you should expect adversarial examples along the overfitted decision boundary. The dataset constructed in this response is a particularly clean example: the optimal classifier would have an accuracy of 90%, but the model is trained to accuracy 99.9%, which means it must be overfitting.</p><p>However, I claim that with large and varied datasets with neural nets, we are typically not in the regime where models overfit to the data, and the presence of &quot;bugs&quot; in the model will decrease. (You certainly <em>can</em> get a neural net to be &quot;buggy&quot;, e.g. by randomly labeling the data, but if you&#x27;re using real data with a natural task then I don&#x27;t expect it to happen to a significant degree.) Nonetheless, adversarial examples persist, because the features that models use are not the ones that humans use.</p><p>It&#x27;s also worth noting that this experiment strongly supports the hypothesis that adversarial examples transfer because they are real features that generalize to the test set.</p><p><u><a href=""https://distill.pub/2019/advex-bugs-discussion/response-1/"">Response: Adversarial Example Researchers Need to Expand What is Meant by ‘Robustness’</a></u> <em>(Justin Gilmer et al)</em>: This response argues that the results in the original paper are simply a consequence of a generally accepted principle: &quot;models lack robustness to distribution shift because they latch onto superficial correlations in the data&quot;. This isn&#x27;t just about L_p norm ball adversarial perturbations: for example, one <u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08988"">recent paper</a></u> shows that if the model is only given access to high frequency features of images (which look uniformly grey to humans), it can still get above 50% accuracy. In fact, when we do adversarial training to become robust to L_p perturbations, then the model pays attention to different non-robust features and becomes more vulnerable to e.g. <u><a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.12261"">low-frequency fog corruption</a></u>. The authors call for adversarial examples researchers to move beyond L_p perturbations and think about the many different ways models can be fragile, and to make them more robust to distributional shift.</p><p><strong>Rohin&#x27;s opinion:</strong> I strongly agree with the worldview behind this response, and especially the principle they identified. I didn&#x27;t know this was a generally accepted principle, though of course I am not an expert on distributional robustness.</p><p>One thing to note is what is meant by &quot;superficial correlation&quot; here. It means a correlation that really does exist in the dataset, that really does generalize to the test set, but that <em>doesn&#x27;t</em> generalize out of distribution. A better term might be &quot;fragile correlation&quot;. All of the experiments so far have been looking at within-distribution generalization (aka generalization to the test set), and are showing that non-robust features <em>do</em> generalize within-distribution. This response is arguing that there are many such non-robust features that will generalize within-distribution but will not generalize under distributional shift, and we need to make our models robust to all of them, not just L_p adversarial perturbations.</p><p><u><a href=""https://distill.pub/2019/advex-bugs-discussion/response-3/"">Response: Two Examples of Useful, Non-Robust Features</a></u> <em>(Gabriel Goh)</em>: This response studies linear features, since we can analytically compute their usefulness and robustness. It plots the singular vectors of the data as features, and finds that such features are either robust and useful, or non-robust and not useful. However, you can get useful, non-robust features by ensembling or contamination (see response for details).</p><p><u><a href=""https://distill.pub/2019/advex-bugs-discussion/response-4/"">Response: Adversarially Robust Neural Style Transfer</a></u> <em>(Reiichiro Nakano)</em>: The original paper showed that adversarial examples don&#x27;t transfer well to VGG, and that VGG doesn&#x27;t tend to learn similar non-robust features as a ResNet. Separately, VGG works particularly well for style transfer. Perhaps since VGG doesn&#x27;t capture non-robust features as well, the results of style transfer look better to humans? This response and the author&#x27;s response investigate this hypothesis in more detail and find that it seems broadly supported, but there are still finnicky details to be worked out.</p><p><strong>Rohin&#x27;s opinion:</strong> This is an intriguing empirical fact. However, I don&#x27;t really buy the theoretical argument that style transfer works because it doesn&#x27;t use non-robust features, since I would typically expect that a model that doesn&#x27;t use L_p-fragile features would instead use features that are fragile or non-robust in some other way.</p><h1><strong>Technical AI alignment</strong></h1><h3><strong>Problems</strong></h3><p><u><a href=""https://alignmentforum.org/posts/rASeoR7iZ9Fokzh7L/problems-in-ai-alignment-that-philosophers-could-potentially"">Problems in AI Alignment that philosophers could potentially contribute to</a></u> <em>(Wei Dai)</em>: Exactly what it says.

In particular, we want to design incentives such that untrusted experts under the incentives will be as helpful as experts intrinsically motivated to help. The experts could be human experts or advanced ML systems; ideally our incentive design would work for both.</p><p>Currently, Ought is running experiments with reading comprehension on Wikipedia articles. The experts get access to the article while the judge does not, but the judge can check whether particular quotes come from the article. They would like to move to tasks that have a greater gap between the experts and the judge (e.g. allowing the experts to use Google), and to tasks that are more subjective (e.g. whether the judge should get Lasik surgery).</p><p><strong>Rohin&#x27;s opinion:</strong> The switch from Factored Cognition to Factored Evaluation is interesting. While it does make it more relevant outside the context of AI alignment (since principal-agent problems abound outside of AI), it still seems like the major impact of Ought is on AI alignment, and I&#x27;m not sure what the difference is there. In <u><a href=""https://blog.openai.com/amplifying-ai-training/"">iterated amplification</a></u> (<u><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/c1f376f3a12e/alignment-newsletter-30"">AN #30</a></u>), when decomposing tasks in the Factored Cognition sense, you would use imitation learning during the distillation step, whereas with Factored Evaluation, you would use reinforcement learning to optimize the evaluation signal. The switch would be useful if you expect the reinforcement learning to work significantly better than imitation learning.</p><p>However, with Factored Evaluation, the agent that you train iteratively is one that must be good at evaluating tasks, and then you&#x27;d need another agent that actually performs the task (or you could train the same agent to do both). In contrast, with Factored Cognition you only need an agent that is performing the task. If the decompositions needed to perform the task are different from the decompositions needed to evaluate the task, then Factored Cognition would presumably have an advantage.</p><h3><strong>Miscellaneous (Alignment)</strong></h3><p><u><a href=""https://alignmentforum.org/posts/mJ5oNYnkYrd4sD5uE/clarifying-some-key-hypotheses-in-ai-alignment"">Clarifying some key hypotheses in AI alignment</a></u> <em>(Ben Cottier et al)</em>: This post (that I contributed to) introduces a diagram that maps out important and controversial hypotheses for AI alignment.

Our argument relies on the claims that Quantum Computing leads to compute overhang instead of algorithmic overhang, and that the difficulties associated with the measurement of quantum states do not invalidate any major assumptions of current Artificial Intelligence Alignment research agendas. We also discuss tripwiring, adversarial blinding, informed oversight and side effects as possible exceptions.</p><p><strong>KEYWORDS:</strong> Quantum Computing, Artificial Intelligence Alignment, Quantum Speedup, Quantum Obfuscation, Quantum Resource Asymmetry.</p><p><strong>EPISTEMIC STATUS:</strong> Exploratory, we could have overlooked key considerations.</p><h1>Introduction</h1><p>Quantum Computing (QC) is a disruptive technology that may not be too far ahead in the horizon. Small proof-of-concept quantum computers have already been built <u><a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms7979"">[1]</a></u> and major obstacles to large-scale quantum computing are being heavily researched <u><a href=""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7927104"">[2]</a></u>.</p><p>Among its potential uses, QC will allow breaking classical cryptographic codes, simulate large quantum systems and faster search and optimization <u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05380"">[3]</a></u>. This last use case is of particular interest to Artificial Intelligence (AI) Strategy. In particular, variants of the Grover algorithm can be exploited to gain a quadratic speedup in search problems, and some recent Quantum Machine Learning (QML) developments have led to exponential gains in certain Machine Learning tasks <u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.02266.pdf"">[4]</a></u> (though with important caveats which may invalidate their practical use <u><a href=""https://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/qml.pdf"">[5]</a></u>).</p><p>These ideas have the potential to exert a transformative effect on research in AI (as noted in <u><a href=""https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/GovAIAgenda.pdf"">[6]</a></u>, for example). Furthermore the technical aspects of QC, which put some physical limits on the observation of the inner workings of a quantum machine and hinder the verification of quantum computations <u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.01082.pdf"">[7]</a></u>, may pose an additional challenge for AI Alignment concerns.</p><p>In this short article we introduce a heuristic model of quantum computing that captures the most relevant characteristics of QC for technical AI Alignment research.</p><p>We then apply our model to abstractly answer in which areas we expect knowledge of QC might be relevant, and discuss four specific avenues of current research where it might come into play: tripwiring, adversarial blinding, informed oversight and avoiding side effects.</p><h1>A model of Quantum Computing for AI Alignment</h1><p>Here we give a very short and simplified introduction to QC for AI Alignment Researchers. For a longer introduction to QC we recommend <em>Quantum Computing for the Very Curious</em> <u><a href=""https://quantum.country/qcvc"">[8]</a></u>. If you&#x27;re already familiar with QC you may want to check our technical refresher in the footnotes in appendix A.</p><p>We introduce <strong>three heuristics, </strong>which to the best of our knowledge capture all relevant aspects of QC for AI Alignment concerns: </p><p>1. <strong>Quantum speedup</strong> - quantum computers are, at most, as powerful as classical computers we allow to run for an exponential amount of time . </p><p>QC usually just gets you quadratic advantages (ie Grover database search <u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/9605043.pdf"">[9]</a></u>, Quantum Walks <u><a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mario_Szegedy/publication/4109377_Quantum_speed-up_of_Markov_Chain_based_algorithms/links/53fb7d920cf22f21c2f33046.pdf"">[10]</a></u>...), although in some cases they are exponential with respect to the best known classical algorithms (eg. Shor <u><a href=""https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/S0036144598347011"">[11]</a></u>, Hamiltonian simulation <u><a href=""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7354428"">[12]</a></u>, HHL <u><a href=""https://journals.aps.org/prl/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevLett.103.150502"">[13]</a></u>...). </p><p>Technically, the class of problems efficiently solvable with a probabilistic classical computer (BPP) is a subset of the class of problems efficiently solvable by a quantum computer (BQP), and that one is itself a subset of the problems solvable in exponential time by a classical deterministic computer (EXP). This means that QC are at least as fast as classical computers, but no more than exponentially faster <u><a href=""https://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/bqpph.pdf"">[14</a></u>, <u><a href=""https://complexityzoo.uwaterloo.ca/Petting_Zoo"">15]</a></u></p><p>2. <strong>Quantum obfuscation</strong> - there is no efficient way of reading the state of a quantum computer while it is operating.</p><p>Quantum operations cannot copy quantum states (“<u><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-cloning_theorem"">No-cloning theorem</a></u>”) <u><a href=""http://copilot.caltech.edu/documents/525-299802a0.pdf"">[16</a></u>, <u><a href=""https://journals.aps.org/rmp/abstract/10.1103/RevModPhys.77.1225"">17]</a></u> and performing a partial or total measure of a quantum state will collapse that part of the state, resulting in loss of information.</p><p>To recover information from a quantum state one has several inefficient options: performing the inner product of the state with another vector (usually through a procedure called the swap test <u><a href=""https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-319-96424-9"">[18]</a></u>), perform many measurements on many identically prepared states to do statistics on the entries (tomography <u><a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms1147.pdf"">[19]</a></u>), or using amplitude estimation <u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0005055.pdf"">[20]</a></u> to estimate a single amplitude. </p><p>The former procedure depends on the precision quadratically and destroys the state, albeit it is independent of the dimension of the vector. The latter two require a number of repetitions at least linear with respect to the dimension of the vector, which grows exponentially with the number of qubits.</p><p>3. <strong>Quantum isolation</strong> - a quantum computer cannot interact with the classical world without its state becoming at least partially classic.</p><p>In other words, if a quantum computer create a side-channel to the outside world during their quantum computation it destroys its coherence and randomizes state according to well defined rules. </p><p>This is directly derived from the postulates of Quantum Mechanics, and in particular the collapse of the wave function when it interacts with the outside world.</p><p>In the following two sections we look at how this model can be applied to gather insight on the phases of research in AI Alignment and kinds of alignment strategies where QC may or may not be relevant.</p><h2>Bottlenecks in Artificial Intelligence Alignment research</h2><p>In this section we introduce a simplified way of thinking about the different phases of research through which we expect the field of AI Alignment to go, and reason about the relevance of quantum computing during each of these phases.</p><p>Looking at some landmark achievements in computer science, it seems that most research begins with working on the formalization of a problem, which then is followed by a period where researchers try to find solutions to the problem, at first just theoretical, then inefficient and finally practical implementations (see for example the history of chess playing, from Shannon’s seminal paper in 1950 to the Deeper Blue vs Kasparov match in 1997 <u><a href=""https://stanford.edu/~cpiech/cs221/apps/deepBlue.html"">[21]</a></u>).</p><p>We expect research in AI Alignment to develop in a similar fashion, and while we have some formalized frameworks to handle some subsets of the problem (see for example IRL <u><a href=""https://ai.stanford.edu/~ang/papers/icml00-irl.pdf"">[22]</a></u>), there is no agreed upon formalization that captures the essence of the whole alignment problem.</p><p>On the other hand, theoretical proposals for QC applications are mostly concerned with speeding up classical algorithms, sometimes with notable improvements (see for example Shor’s algorithm for factorization <u><a href=""https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/S0036144598347011"">[11]</a></u>), and in some rare cases it has inspired the creation of novel algorithmic strategies <u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.04271"">[23]</a></u>. In no case that we know of has QC lead to a formalization insight of the kind that we believe AI Alignment is bottlenecked on.</p><p>That is, QC has so far only helped find efficient solutions to problems that were already properly formalized, while we believe that the most significant problems in AI Alignment have not yet matured into proper formalizations.</p><p>This observation serves as an empirical verification of the quantum speedup heuristic, that instructs us to think about quantum computing as a black box accelerator rather than a novel approach to algorithmic design, and thus we should not expect formalization insights to come from QC. In other words, QC may lead to what would be equivalent to compute overhang, but not lead to significant insight overhang.</p><p>We conclude that while QC may help in a later phase of AI Alignment research with making safe AI algorithms practical and competitive, it is very unlikely that it will lead to novel theoretical insights that fundamentally change how we think about AI Alignment.</p><p>As a side note, the same reasoning applies to AI capabilities research; QC is unlikely to lead to new formal insights on that field. However, the quantum speedup may enable the practical use of algorithms which were previously considered inefficient. This is concerning to the extent that we expect compute overhang to lead to more opaque and/or less safe algorithms.</p><h2>Alignment Strategies: incentive design versus active oversight</h2><p>In this section we introduce a distinction between two main broad complementary strategies for achieving AI Alignment:  incentive design and active oversight, and reason about how QC may interact with them.</p><p>By <strong>incentive design</strong> we mean static strategies, where the design of an agent is verified to have certain safety properties that incentivize the agent to pursue desirable goals.</p><p>By <strong>active oversight</strong> we refer to dynamic strategies, where an agent, which may or may not be safe, is monitored, and if certain metrics indicate unsafeness, an intervention is made to safely interrupt or modify the agent.</p><p>We believe that a complete solution to the AI Alignment problem will include both elements of incentive design and active oversight.</p><p>Since we can treat QC as a black box accelerator according to the quantum speedup heuristic, we can see that QC does not present any additional challenges for incentive design. In other words, since designing the right incentives for the behaviour of the agent is independent of the hardware and implementation efficiency, QC is unlikely to help with this endeavour. </p><p>Instead of concerning themselves with the intricacies of QC, AI Alignment researchers may just treat QC as a black box and reason about classical equivalents instead. This is analogous to how AI Safety researchers do not need to think about whether an agent will be implemented over GPUs or serial processors and only focus on the formalisms.</p><p>Those alternatives may be exponentially slower; however, if the safety of our agent design relies on the assumption that the agent will not be able to acquire exponentially more resources for computation we cannot really deem it safe, making this a moot point.</p><p>One possible counter-argument to our line of reasoning above is that quantum computing may influence which AI designs end up being successful, and knowledge about the AI designs that are going to be more popular in the future can allow us to make extra assumptions to facilitate incentive design. We leave as an open question whether we can reliable predict features about QC-powered agents that will allow us to make these kind of simplifying assumptions.</p><p>Moving on from incentive design, we point out that  QC may pose an additional challenge to active oversight due to quantum obfuscation, as it might interfere with measures of the internal state of a QC. In the next section we explore some AI Alignment research areas where this fact comes into play.</p><h1>Review of AI Alignment research agendas</h1><p>We have reviewed the AI Alignment agendas of <em>Concrete Problems in AI Safety</em> <u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.06565.pdf"">[24]</a></u>, MIRI’s research agendas <u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.09469.pdf"">[25]</a></u> and <em>Iterated Distillation and Amplification</em> <u><a href=""https://ai-alignment.com/iterated-distillation-and-amplification-157debfd1616"">[26]</a></u>.</p><p>Most of their work focuses on incentive design as the de facto route to a solution. As such, QC does not affect the main assumptions and considered solutions. However, we have been able to identify three areas of active oversight where QC may be a relevant consideration: tripwiring, adversarial blinding, informed oversight and avoiding side effects.</p><p>We discuss each of these areas in depth.</p><h3>Tripwiring</h3><p><strong>Tripwiring </strong>is a class of mechanisms that alert of, or directly prevent attempts of an agent to hack its reward function <u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.06565.pdf"">[24]</a></u>. If a particular tripwire design relies on access to the internal state of the agent, quantum obfuscation may impede its effective implementation.</p><p>For example, in the Transparency section of <em>Techniques for optimizing worst-case performance</em> <u><a href=""https://ai-alignment.com/techniques-for-optimizing-worst-case-performance-39eafec74b99"">[27]</a></u>, Paul Christiano writes:</p><p><em>“While training a model, we are free to look inside and ‘see what it’s thinking’. If we could actually understand those thoughts, we might be able to more easily predict under what conditions it would fail malignantly.”</em></p><p>Unfortunately, due to quantum obfuscation, this seems rather complicated if the agent has quantum capabilities. You will just be able to efficiently read the input/output of the used quantum subroutines, but not its inner operation.</p><p>Nevertheless, there might be easier ways for a misaligned agent to obfuscate what it is doing, such as classically encoding its hidden plans in ways that an overseer will not understand (for example, it can encode its state with quantum-resistant cryptography <u><a href=""https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2016/nist.ir.8105.pdf"">[28]</a></u>). However some early work points in the direction that quantum-based obfuscation may be significantly more powerful than classical alternatives <u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.01771.pdf"">[29]</a></u>.</p><p>Another consideration is that quantum obfuscation offers a more plausible excuse for obfuscation than classical cryptography. For a classical agent that doesn&#x27;t need to encrypt information during its expected workflow, any encryption attempt might indicate misalignment and trigger a shutdown. If, in contrast, the QC agent hides important information in a quantum superposition, this might be misaligned behavior or just a consequence of wanting to exploit the quantum speedup.</p><p>Finally, one could imagine some kind of quantum tripwire that monitors the quantum computer from within the superposition. For example, a quantum bit that flags whether the tripwire has been activated. Since quantum computing allows for conditional operations, one could imagine freezing the state if such state has been reached in the superposition, only allowing it to proceed while it has not. Then one could perform amplitude estimation to check that the flag has not been activated in any branch of the computation, and otherwise kill it.</p><h3>Adversarial blinding</h3><p><strong>Adversarial blinding</strong> consists of using adversarial techniques to blind the agent with respect to some variables. This technique could be used to make it difficult for the agent to understand how its reward is generated and therefore how it can be hacked <u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.06565.pdf"">[24]</a></u>.</p><p>In the case where there is an asymmetry of resources and the overseer has access to quantum computers but the agent does not, we know that there are distributions that are just not efficiently computable classically (will need exponential resources), but are efficiently computable quantically. This suggests the possibility of using  one of those distributions to generate a difficult to hack reward.</p><h3>Informed oversight</h3><p>In the <strong>informed oversight</strong> scenario, the verifier checks that the behavior of an agent is safe, and the requirements on the verifier do not grow too much as the agent becomes more and more powerful <u><a href=""https://ai-alignment.com/the-informed-oversight-problem-1b51b4f66b35"">[30]</a></u>.</p><p>If there is an asymmetry in resources where the verifier has access to QC while the agent does not, this may be exploited using quantum speedup to allow the verifier to do certain checks in polynomial time for operations that will take the agent exponential time to check themselves.</p><p>In particular, quantum speedup may help with the amplification step of IDA, where we give an agent access to QC to design and verify a stronger successor, whose resources will be constrained as in not having access to QC themselves during the verification step.</p><p>It is however unclear whether this scheme of only giving access to the agent to QC after it has been verified is possible, and whether we can reliably restrain the agent from accessing QC while it is being verified.</p><h3>Side effects and AI boxing</h3><p>We would like to be able to reliably detect and prevent AI systems from interacting with the world in unexpected ways (this is referred to in the literature as <strong>avoiding side effects</strong> <u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.06565.pdf"">[24]</a></u>). </p><p>Per the quantum isolation heuristic, when a process implemented in a quantum computer tries to affect the outside world it has to necessarily partially collapse part of the state (unless the state is already classical).</p><p>One may think of  taking advantage of this phenomena to monitor whether a quantum agent has interacted with the outside world. There are however some associated difficulties.</p><p>Firstly, and most importantly, we cannot distinguish a partial collapse from a constructive interference when the amplitude of the subset of qubits we are interested in is 1. That is, it may be the case that part of the state is classical and we cannot effectively tell whether this is due to collapse or because all states in superposition agree on the state of a particular subset of qubits.</p><p>Secondly, to tell whether the process has (partially) collapsed we need to measure it, which will collapse it in turn, and even worse, we will not be able to know whether the state had collapsed before or because of our measurement. Thus we would need to resort to one of the inefficient ways of measuring the quantum state, like amplitude estimation.</p><p>All this means it does not seem possible to strongly and efficiently infer interaction with the outside world through learning that part of the state of the agent’s mind is classical.</p><p>Relatedly, <strong>AI boxing</strong> refers to restraintment strategies where an AI system is isolated from the environment to prevent unexpected side effects  <u><a href=""https://nickbostrom.com/papers/oracle.pdf"">[31]</a></u>.</p><p>The quantum isolation heuristic may mislead us into thinking that boxing may be easier to achieve in QC. However this is not the case; as long as a process inside a QC is willing to partially collapse part of its state it can escape its quantum box. In fact, one of the most active areas of current research in QC is investigating how to isolate the quantum system so it does not collapse unexpectedly.</p><p>So, in conclusion, one may think of quantum computers as oracles, but that does not mean that they are naturally boxed already.</p><h1>Conclusion and open questions</h1><p>We have presented a simplified model of quantum computing for AI Alignment, summarized in two heuristics: the quantum speedup heuristic (QC allows a quadratic and sometimes exponential speedup) and the quantum obfuscation heuristic (qubits cannot be read without destroying the computation).</p><p>Our main conclusion is that we do not expect Quantum Computing to be relevant to the current technical AI Alignment research agendas. </p><p>In particular, we do not expect QC techniques to be relevant for safety until we are actually interested in making algorithms and protocol as efficient as possible.</p><p>Furthermore, we expect QC to not be relevant for general incentive design purposes. However, we have also listed some current research problems related to active oversight where it might be helpful to have our simplified model of quantum computing in mind. In any case we do not expect these issues to have high relevance right now, as most of the current work in current AI Alignment falls under incentive design strategies rather than active oversight.</p><p>Some further questions that came up during our research:</p><ul><li>Can we expect humanity to develop reliable QC before AGI? How do the developments in each field interact with one another? Will quantum machine learning significantly increase AI capabilities? Since one of the most straightforward and promising applications of QC is material science, should we expect QC to lead to further improvements in non-QC computing technology? How does that affect AI Capabilities?</li><li>How does QC affect AI Governance? How easy is to deploy powerful QC-powered AI systems? How easily can we monitor the labs that have QC capabilities? If QC is relevant to the development of AGI, can the fact that QC capabilities are more concentrated affect the dynamics of development of AGI?  </li><li>How does the quantum speedup possibility affect AI design? Can developments in QC lead to opaque AI, as the compute improvements allow raw search design to be used instead of design from first principles? Relatedly, what AI designs would be particularly favored by QC technology versus raw improvements in compute? </li><li>Is quantum obfuscation the most efficient obfuscation strategy a misaligned agent can have access to? Can classical cryptography be used to obfuscate information?</li><li>Is asymmetry of resources a reasonable assumption to make in verifier / agent scenarios? How can asymmetry of QC resources be exploited for safety purposes?</li><li>How could we design quantum tripwires? What are their strengths and limitations?</li><li>How would we go about implementing an adversarial blinding scheme based on quantum distribution sampling?</li><li>In the case where QC is relevant for the design of advanced AIs, can we expect to have an actual quantum agent in the future, or will it just be a classical agent with access to quantum subroutines, in a CAIS fashion?</li></ul><p>Article by Jaime Sevilla (FHI summer research fellow) and Pablo Moreno (PhD student in QC, Complutense University of Madrid).</p><p>We want to thank Linh Chi Nguyen, Adrian Hutter, Anders Sandberg, Max Daniel, Richard Möhn and Daniel Eth for incredibly useful feedback, editing and discussion.</p><h3>Appendix A: Speed technical introduction to Quantum Computing</h3><p>Quantum states are complex unitary vectors. A basis vector is just a classical state, whereas any other is called a superposition (a linear combination of basis states) <u><a href=""http://mmrc.amss.cas.cn/tlb/201702/W020170224608149940643.pdf"">[32]</a></u>. Quantum Computing is based on unitary transformations of these quantum states. Non-unitary dynamics can be introduced via measurements: a measurement projects the quantum state into a basis state (classical state) with a probability equal to the square of the amplitude of that state (the coefficient in the linear combination).</p><h3>Bibliography</h3><p>[1] Córcoles, A.

It would be odd for a future civilization to dedicate a large fraction of their computational resources towards simulating early 21st century humans instead of happy transhuman living in base reality; shouldn&#x27;t we therefore be equally perplexed that we aren&#x27;t transhumans?</p><p>I guess the question boils down to the choice of reference classes, so what makes the reference class &quot;early 21st century humans&quot; so special? Why not widen the reference class to include all conscious minds, or narrow it down to the exact quantum state of a brain?</p><p>Furthermore, if you&#x27;re convinced by the simulation argument, why not believe that you&#x27;re a Boltzmann brain instead using the same line of argument?</p>",,,,

To create these “probabilities”, each statement is associated with an asset in a prediction market, which eventually pays $1 if the statement is proven true, or $0 if it is proven false. The “probabilities” are then the prices of these assets.</p><p>(It’s also possible that a statement is never proven <em>or</em> disproven, and one of the many interesting results of the paper is that logical inductors assign useful prices in that case too.)</p><p>The logical induction paper has two main pieces. First, it introduces the <em>logical induction criterion</em>: a system which assigns prices to statements over time is called a “logical inductor” if the prices cannot be exploited by any polynomial-time trading algorithm. The paper then shows that this criterion implies that the prices have a whole slew of useful, intuitive, probability-like properties.</p><p>The second main piece of the paper proves that at least one logical inductor is computable: the paper constructs an (extremely slow) algorithm to compute inexploitable prices for logical statements. The algorithm works by running a prediction market in which every possible polynomial-time trader is a participant. Naturally, the prices in this market turn out to be inexploitable by any polynomial-time trader - so, this giant simulated prediction market is a logical inductor.</p><h2>Our Goal</h2><p>An analogy: one could imagine a decision theorist making a list of cool properties they want their decision theory to have, then saying “well, here’s one possible decision algorithm which satisfies these properties: maximize expected utility”. That would be cool and useful, but what we really want is a theorem saying that <em>any</em> possible decision algorithm which satisfies the cool properties can be represented as maximizing expected utility.</p><p>This is analogous to the situation in the logical induction paper: there’s this cool criterion for handling logical uncertainty, and it implies a bunch of cool properties. The paper then says “well, here’s one possible algorithm which satisfies these properties: simulate a prediction market containing every possible polynomial-time trader”. That’s super cool and useful, but what we really want is a theorem saying that <em>any</em> possible algorithm which satisfies the cool properties can represented as a prediction market containing every possible polynomial-time trader.</p><p>That’s our goal. We want to show that any possible logical inductor can be represented by a market of traders - i.e. there is some market of traders which produces exactly the same prices.</p><h2>The Proof</h2><p>We’ll start with a slightly weaker theorem: any prices which are inexploitable by a particular trader T can be represented by a market in which T is a participant.</p><p>Conceptually, we can sketch out the proof as:</p><ul><li>The “trader” T is a function which takes in prices P, and returns a portfolio T(P) specifying how much of each asset it wants to hold.</li><li>The rest of the market is represented by an aggregate trader M (for “market”), which takes in prices P and returns a portfolio M(P) specifying how much of each asset the rest of the market wants to hold.</li><li>The “market maker” mechanism chooses prices so that the total portfolio held by everyone is zero - i.e. T(P) + M(P) = 0. This means that any long position held by T must be balanced by a short position held by M, and vice versa, at the market prices.</li><li>We know the trader’s function T, and we know the prices P which we want to represent, so we solve for M: M(P) = -T(P)</li></ul><p>… so the market containing M and T reproduces the prices P, as desired. One problem: this conceptual “proof” works even if the prices are exploitable. What gives?</p><p>The main trick here is budgeting: the real setup gives the traders limited budget, and they can’t keep trading if they go broke. Since M is doing exactly the opposite of T, M will go broke when T has unbounded gains - i.e. when T exploits the prices (this is basically the definition of exploitation used in the paper). But if the prices are inexploitable, then T’s possible gains are bounded, therefore M’s possible losses are bounded, and M can keep counterbalancing T’s trades indefinitely.</p><p>Let’s formalize that a bit. I’ll re-use notation from the logical induction paper without redefining everything, so check the paper for full definitions.</p><p>First, let’s write out the correct version of “T(P) + M(P) = 0”. The missing piece is budgeting: rather than letting traders trade directly, the logical induction algorithm builds “budgeted” traders <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""B_{b_T}(T)""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">B</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.219em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-texatom"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">b</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 83.3%; vertical-align: -0.278em; padding-right: 0.06em;""><span class=""mjx-mi"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.12em;"">T</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">(</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.12em;"">T</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">)</span></span></span></span></span></span> and <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""B_{b_M}(M)""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">B</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.219em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-texatom"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">b</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 83.3%; vertical-align: -0.284em; padding-right: 0.06em;""><span class=""mjx-mi"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.081em;"">M</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">(</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.081em;"">M</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">)</span></span></span></span></span></span>, where <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""b_T""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">b</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mi"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.12em;"">T</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> and <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""b_M""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">b</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mi"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.081em;"">M</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> are the two traders’ starting budgets.

Since the prices are inexploitable by every trader, the traders’ aggregate best-case gains are bounded above, so M’s worst-case loss is bounded below. This works even with infinite traders, as long as the total budget of all traders remains finite.</p><p>In particular, if we consider all polynomial-time traders (with budgeting and other details handled as in the paper), we find that any prices satisfying the logical induction criterion can be represented by a market containing all of the polynomial-time traders.</p><h2>The Bigger Picture</h2><p>Why does this matter?</p><p>First and foremost, it neatly characterizes the class of logical inductors: there are degrees of freedom in budgeting, and a huge degree of freedom in choosing the trader M which shares the market with our polynomial-time traders, but that’s it - that’s all we need to represent all possible logical inductors. (Note that this does not mean that simulating a prediction market containing all possible polynomial-time traders is the only way to <em>implement</em> a logical inductor - just that there is always a prediction market which produces the same prices as the logical inductor.)</p><p>Second, the proof is short and simple enough to generalize well. We should expect a similar technique to work under other notions of exploitability, and in scenarios beyond logical induction. This ties in to a general research path I’ve been playing with: many conditions of “inexploitability” or “efficiency” which we typically associate with utility functions instead produce markets when we relax the assumptions somewhat. Since markets are <u><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_agent"">strictly more general than utility functions</a></u>, and typically satisfy the same inexploitability/inefficiency criteria under more general assumptions, these kinds of results suggest that we should use markets of subagents in many models where we currently use utilities - see “<u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/3xF66BNSC5caZuKyC/why-subagents"">Why Subagents?</a></u>” for more along these lines.</p>",johnswentworth,johnswentworth,johnswentworth,

This is currently experimental, but I estimate ~80% chance that it will become long-term, and so I’m looking for people who are likely to contribute at least 20 summaries over the course of their tenure at the newsletter (see caveats in the post). <strong>To apply, read this <u><a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zzMyG2VmyW5l3yy7rBx4B8pLwGxLnMRRHgFNJEdHLgg/edit#"">doc</a></u>, write an example summary + opinion, and fill out this <u><a href=""https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScyZ4CN4A4lj3qxNe0y8pqs8xg_K72I3QskT9lufCqtw9Ul4Q/viewform?usp=sf_link"">form</a></u> by Friday, September 6.</strong> I am also looking for someone to take over the work of publishing the newsletter (~1-3 hours per week); please send me an <u><a href=""mailto:rohinmshah@berkeley.edu?subject=Interested%20in%20publisher%20role%20for%20Alignment%20Newsletter%20EOM"">email</a></u> if you’d be interested in this.</p><p><strong>ETA:</strong> I now have enough interest in the publisher role that I would be shocked if none of them worked out. Feel free to continue expressing interest if you think you&#x27;d particularly benefit from doing the work, or if you think you&#x27;d be particularly good at it.</p><h3>Roles I am looking for</h3><p><strong>Publisher:</strong> Once all of the summaries and opinions are written, you would turn them into an actual newsletter, send it out for proofreading, fix any typos found, update the <u><a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PwWbWZ6FPqAgZWOoOcXM8N_tUCuxpEyMbN1NYYC02aM/edit#gid=0"">database</a></u>, etc. This currently takes me around half an hour per newsletter. Ideally, you would also take on some tasks that I haven’t found the time for: improving the visual design of the newsletter, A/B testing different versions to see what people engage with, publicity, and so on, for a total of ~1-3 hours per week.</p><p>Since I don’t yet have the setup to pay people to help with the newsletter, I am only looking for expressions of interest.

There have been many other things that seem more important to do. This is both because I’m more optimistic about the other work I’m doing, and because I no longer find it as useful to read papers as I did when I started the newsletter. As a result, I now have over 100 articles that I would probably want to send out, but haven’t gotten around to yet. This is also partly because there’s just more stuff coming out now. (I mentioned some of these points in the <u><a href=""https://alignmentforum.org/posts/3onCb5ph3ywLQZMX2/alignment-newsletter-one-year-retrospective"">retrospective</a></u>.)</p><p>Another reason for more content creators is that as I have learned more since starting the newsletter, I have developed my own idiosyncratic beliefs, and I think I have become worse at intuitively interpreting other posts from the author’s perspective rather than my own. (In other words, I would perform worse at an Ideological Turing Test of their position than I would have in the past, unless I put in a lot of effort into it.) I expect that with more writers the newsletter will better reflect a diversity of opinions.</p><h3>Why should you do it?</h3><p><strong>It’s impactful.</strong> See the <u><a href=""https://alignmentforum.org/posts/3onCb5ph3ywLQZMX2/alignment-newsletter-one-year-retrospective"">retrospective</a></u> for more on this point.

I don’t know to what extent this will transfer to you.</p><p><strong>You might be paid.</strong> Currently this is experimental, so I haven’t actually thought much about payment. I expect that I could get a grant to pay you if I ended up deciding that it would be worth it. However, it might be that dealing with all of the paperwork + tax implications cancels out any time savings, though I think this is unlikely. If this is an important factor to you, please do let me know when you apply.</p><h3>Qualifications</h3><ul><li>Likely to contribute at least 20 summaries to the newsletter over time, at least 4 of which are in the first month (for onboarding purposes).

The main part of the application is to write an example summary and opinion for an article (which I may send out in the newsletter, if you give me permission to). Ideally you would write a summary on one of the articles from the list below, but if there isn’t an article in the subarea you’d like to write on, you can choose some other article (that hasn’t already been summarized in the newsletter) and summarize that.

A computer running a linear program solver, a SAT-solver, or gradient descent, would be an example of a system that is an “optimizer” in this sense. That is, it runs an <em>optimization algorithm</em>. Let “optimizer_1” denote this concept.</p><p>Second, a system can be an “optimizer” in the sense that it optimizes its environment. A human is an optimizer in this sense, because we robustly take actions that push our environment in a certain direction. A reinforcement learning agent can also be thought of as an optimizer in this sense, but confined to whatever environment it is run in. This is the sense in which “optimizer” is used in posts such as <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/D7EcMhL26zFNbJ3ED/optimization"">this</a>. Let “optimizer_2” denote this concept.</p><p>These two concepts are distinct. Say that you somehow hook up a linear program solver to a reinforcement learning environment. Unless you do the “hooking up” in a particularly creative way there is no reason to assume that the output of the linear program solver would push the environment in a particular direction. Hence a linear program solver is an optimizer_1, but not an optimizer_2. On the other hand, a simple tabular RL agent <em>would</em> eventually come to systematically push the environment in a particular direction, and is hence an optimizer_2. However, such a system does not run any internal optimization algorithm, and is therefore not an optimizer_1. This means that a system can be an optimizer_1 while not being an optimizer_2, and vice versa.</p><p>There are some arguments related to AI safety that seem to conflate these two concepts. In <em>Superintelligence </em>(pg 153), on the topic of Tool AI, Nick Bostrom writes that:</p><blockquote>A second place where trouble could arise is in the course of the software’s operation. If the methods that the software uses to search for a solution are sufficiently sophisticated, they may include provisions for managing the search process itself in an intelligent manner. In this case, the machine running the software may begin to seem less like a mere tool and more like an agent. Thus, the software may start by developing a plan for how to go about its search for a solution. The plan may specify which areas to explore first and with what methods, what data to gather, and how to make best use of available computational resources. In searching for a plan that satisfies the software’s internal criterion (such as yielding a sufficiently high probability of finding a solution satisfying the user-specified criterion within the allotted time), the software may stumble on an unorthodox idea. For instance, it might generate a plan that begins with the acquisition of additional computational resources and the elimination of potential interrupters (such as human beings).</blockquote><p>To me, this argument seems to make an unexplained jump from optimizer_1 to optimizer_2. It begins with the observation that a powerful Tool AI would be likely to optimize its internal computation in various ways, and that this optimization process could be quite powerful. In other words, a powerful Tool AI would be a strong optimizer_1. It then concludes that the system might start pursuing convergent instrumental goals – in other words, that it would be an optimizer_2. The jump between the two is not explained. </p><p>The implicit assumption seems to be that an optimizer_1 could turn into an optimizer_2 unexpectedly if it becomes sufficiently powerful. It is not at all clear to me that this is the case – I have not seen any good argument to support this, nor can I think of any myself. The fact that a system is internally running an optimization algorithm does not imply that the system is selecting its output in such a way that this output optimizes the environment of the system. </p><p>The excerpt from <em>Superintelligence</em> is just one example of an argument that seems to slide between optimizer_1 and optimizer_2. For example, some parts of <em><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/wKnwcjJGriTS9QxxL/dreams-of-friendliness"">Dreams of Friendliness</a> </em>seem to be doing so, or at least it&#x27;s not always clear which of the two is being talked about. I’m sure there are more examples as well.</p><p>Be mindful of this distinction when reasoning about AI. I propose that “consequentialist” (or perhaps &quot;<a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/4dHMdK5TLN6xcqtyc/p/DfcywmqRSkBaCB6Ma"">goal-directed</a>&quot;) is used to mean what I have called “optimizer_2”. I don’t think there is a need for a special word to denote what I have called “optimizer_1” (at least not once the distinction between optimizer_1 and optimizer_2 has been pointed out).</p><br/><p>Note: It is possible to raise a sort of embedded agency-like objection against the distinction between optimizer_1 and optimizer_2. One might argue that:</p><blockquote>There is no sharp boundary between the inside and the outside of a computer. An “optimizer_1” is just an optimizer whose optimization target is defined in terms of the state of the computer it is installed on, whereas an “optimizer_2” is an optimizer whose optimization target is defined in terms of something outside the computer. Hence there is no categorical difference between an optimizer_1 and an optimizer_2.</blockquote><p>I don’t think that this argument works. Consider the following two systems:</p><ul><li>A computer that is able to very quickly solve very large linear programs.</li><li>A computer that solves linear programs, and tries to prevent people from turning it off as it is doing so, etc.</li></ul><p>System 1 is an optimizer_1 that solves linear programs, whereas system 2 is an optimizer_2 that is optimizing the state of the computer that it is installed on. These two things are different. (Moreover, the difference isn’t just that system 2 is “more powerful” than system 1 – system 1 might even be a better linear program solver than system 2.)</p><br/><p>Acknowledgements: <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/r9tYkB2a8Fp4DN8yB"">We</a> were aware of the difference between &quot;optimizer_1&quot; and &quot;optimizer_2&quot; while working on the mesa-optimization paper, and I&#x27;m not sure who first pointed it out.

I wrote this a year ago, but when I wanted to link to it recently I found out it wasn't in existence on LW (except as a link post which isn't very satisfactory). I decided to polish it up and post it here.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><h2>Epistemic Status</h2><p>This is basic information, and while it is original to me, I make no claim that the the content thereof is new. Nevertheless, I think it is important enough to be worth posting.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><h1>Abstract</h1><p>I outline a framework for thinking about the motivations (goals/values) of agents.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><h1>Introduction</h1><p>In a few articles I've read (written at different times) and in some conversations I've had, I identified what I perceived as confused thinking regarding the motivations of agents. This post is my attempt to rectify that confused thinking and provide a framework that will help people reason more coherently about agents' motivations.</p><hr><h1>Three Levels of Motivation</h1><p>I have identified three levels at which the motivations of an agent can be considered. I will briefly outline these levels, and then expand on them in subsequent sections.</p><h2>Brief Outline</h2><p><strong>Level 1 (L1) - Ideal Specification:</strong> The motivations the designer created the agent with the intention of accomplishing. These exist exclusively in the designer's mind and are not part of the agent.</p><p><strong>Level 2 (L2) - Designed Specification:</strong> The motivations that are explicitly represented in the agent itself. What motivations the agent makes decisions with the intention of accomplishing. These motivations exist within the agent program.</p><p><strong>Level 3 (L3) - Revealed Specification:</strong> The motivations that are actually pursued by the agent via its actions; insomuch as the actions of the agent can be described as optimising over the output of some objective function, which function is it? This is a property of the agent function.</p><p>The three levels are interrelated, but are distinct. Traditional language does not clearly delineate which level of motivation one is talking about when one talks about an agent's motivations, and thus allows the potential for confusion to arise due to people using the same word(s) to refer to different concepts.</p><hr><h1>Case Studies</h1><p>I will consider a couple of (toy) agents to more clearly illustrate the differences between the three levels of motivation.</p><h3>Fred</h3><p>Fred is a naive attempt at creating a Friendly Artificial Intelligence (FAI). Fred was designed with the intention of maximising human utility (according to some model of utilitarianism which shall not be specified, as there are many variants, no clear consensus and the actual implementation involved isn't relevant for our purposes). However, because human values are complex and hard to define, Fred's programming represents the simpler concept of happiness (which is still a little complex, but is easier to capture than human utility. At any rate, let's assume that Fred's designer succeeds in suitably capturing the concept of human happiness). Fred's actions are chosen with the aim of maximising human happiness. As Fred learns more about the world and updates its model of the world, Fred learns that ""happiness"" in humans is associated with a increase in the presence of certain neurotransmitters in the brain. Repeatedly encountering this correlation, leads Fred to infer causation. Fred ""learns"" that dopamine causes happiness. Fred proceeds to enact plans to pump as many humans full of dopamine as it can, sending them to catatonic bliss.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><h3>Tiffany</h3><p>Tiffany is an agent that plays tic tac toe. Tiffany's creator designed Tiffany with the intention of achieving optimal performance in tic tac toe (never losing, and winning when possible). However, because tic tac toe is a simple deterministic game with no memory, Tiffany contains no internal state and no model of the world. Tiffany's programming consists only of a collection of if then rules describing the optimal action to play for any given board position. Because tic tac toe is a solved game (and the number of possible board positions is relatively small), Tiffany is effective and plays optimally.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><h1>In Depth Explanation</h1><h3>Level 1</h3><p>L1 motivations are the designer's intentions for the agent. What the designer wants the agent to achieve, as separate from what the agent itself wants to achieve (L2)—in so far as the agent can be said to ""want"" anything—and what the agent is actually achieving/pursuing as inferred from its actions (L3). In the Fred example, Fred's L1 motivation would be maximising human utility (it is entirely irrelevant that Fred completely fails at achieving this). In the Tiffany example, Tiffany's L1 motivation is optimal tic tac toe play (it is similarly irrelevant that Tiffany actually succeeds in achieving this). Only the intentions of the designer determine(s) the L1 motivation(s) of an agent, and to identify them you look at the designer's mind (and neither the agent's mind nor the agent's actions).</p><p>When the motivations of an agent are colloquially referred to, L1 motivation is typically not what is meant as people usually distinguish between the motivation of the designer in designing an agent and the motivation of the agent itself. The divide between L2 and L3 motivations is not so clear, and that is usually where the confusion/ambiguity arises when motivations of an agent are referred to in everyday usage.</p><p>In their article: ""<a href=""https://medium.com/@deepmindsafetyresearch/building-safe-artificial-intelligence-52f5f75058f1"">Building Safe Artificial Intelligence: Specification, Robustness and Assurance</a>"", the Deepmind Safety Research team refers to L1 motivations as the ""ideal specification"".</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><h3>Level 2</h3><p>The L2 motivations of an agent are those explicitly represented within the agent program—what the agent ""wants"". It may intuitively seem that the L2 motivation of an agent is the agent's actual motivation, but further explanation would show that this is not necessarily the case. First let us consider two classes of agents:</p><ul><li>Motivational agents.</li><li>Motivationless agents.</li></ul><p>Motivational agents are agents who possess L2 motivations. They include goal based, utility based and general learning agents. These agents deliberately act in pursuit of some goal(s) or to maximise some value(s). In our case study, Fred would be an example of a motivational agent.</p><p>Motivationless agents are agents who don't possess L2 motivations. They include simple reflex agents and model based reflex agents. Generally, the agent program of a motivationless agent is behavioural (it contains a set of “if then” rules that prescribe the actions of the agent in any situation it faces). From our case study, Tiffany is an example of a motivationless agent.</p><p>It is obvious that regardless of the contents of the agent program of a reflex agent, it is always motivationless because its agent program contains no explicit reference to any motivation which the agent pursues. The action of the agent in any possible situation it can face has already been hard coded, so the agent does not explicitly act in pursuit of a particular motivation. Revisiting Tiffany again, Tiffany has no L2 motivation, but Tiffany’s actions are such that they ensure that Tiffany does not lose, and maximise the probability of Tiffany winning. Tiffany can be viewed as an agent who optimises for tic tac toe performance, even though no reference is made to the concept in Tiffany’s programming. This model of Tiffany is useful and carries predictive power as it allows us to predict Tiffany’s actions in a variety of scenarios without knowing Tiffany’s programming. It seems that in some sense, Tiffany has the motivation of maximising its tic tac toe performance. Given that agents can lack L2 motivations, yet behave as if they were acting in pursuit of (a) certain goal(s)/value(s), it seems flawed to hold the view that the motivation of an agent can only be its L2 motivation. In fact, it shall be shown in the subsequent section that every motivational agent is functionally identical to some motivationless agent.</p><p>In the aforementioned article, L2 motivations are referred to as the ""design specification"".</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><h3>Level 3</h3><p>In determining the L3 motivations of an agent, we look exclusively at the agent's actions, and consider what motivation the agent’s actions are pursuing (what goal(s)/value(s) is/are realised as a result of the actions the agent takes). To do this, we'd examine the agent function and likely future evolution of the world giving the actions the agent takes. The agent function is the mapping from the agent’s percept sequence (the sequence of all percepts from inception to the moment the agent is choosing an action) to the agent’s actions. The agent function maps every possible percept sequence to an action, and thus completely characterises the agent’s behaviour (as a result, any given agent is functionally identical to some reflex agent who contains the production rules mapping each percept sequence to the output of the agent function for that percept sequence (reflex agent equivalents of generally intelligent agents (e.g the average adult human) would probably be impractical to build in our physical universe)).</p><p>In our case study, Tiffany’s agent function is such that Tiffany’s actions optimise for tic tac toe performance. Thus maximising tic tac toe performance is Tiffany’s L3 motivation. On the other hand, because of Fred’s model of the world, Fred maximises dopamine concentration in the brain, and not actually happiness (insofar as you do not agree that pumping you full of dopamine/alternative wireheading is the way to make you happiest). Fred and Tiffany both display L3 motivations that are different from their L2 motivations (in Tiffany’s case because they outright lack L2 motivations). Fred illustrates another way in which agents can have differing L2 and L3 motivations—when the agent’s model of the world is inaccurate or otherwise inadequate.</p><p>Determining an agent’s L3 motivations is not so straightforward, as every agent trivially optimises for being the agent that they are. That is each agent can be said to maximise the utility function which assigns highest utility to the output of their agent function for their given percept sequence and low utility to everything else. However, this is not a useful motivation to ascribe to agents as it does not convey any predictive power (we cannot determine the output of the agent function for a given percept sequence if we don’t already know it), and would also be quite complex. I would suggest that as a rule of thumb, when evaluating candidate objective functions for an agent, one should reward candidate functions for higher predictive power and punish candidate functions for higher complexity. If you were to assign a real number to the candidate function that represented how suitable it was as an L3 motivation of the agent, then assuming complexity of the function was held constant, the number would be directly proportional to predictive power, and if predictive power were held constant, it would be inversely proportional to complexity. However, formalising the notion of predictive power is beyond the scope of this post (and my ability).</p><p>It is my view that the most relevant motivation of the agent is the agent’s L3 motivation, since it is what tell us how the agent will actually behave. In fact, as you move from L1 to L3 motivation, the usefulness (in terms of predicting the agent’s behaviour) increases. Insofar as one is concerned primarily about the behaviour of agents, the L3 motivation of the agent has the greatest importance.</p><p>The Deepmind Safety Research article refers to L3 motivations as ""revealed specification"".</p><hr><h1>Summary</h1><p>Level 1: What the designer “wants”.</p><p>Level 2: What the agent “wants”.</p><p>Level 3: What the agent does.</p><p>As you move from L1 to L3, the predictive power of the motivation at that level increases. For those primarily concerned with the behaviour of the agent, L3 is the most important motivation.</p><hr><h1>References</h1><ul><li>Russel and Norvig, “Artificial Intelligence A Modern Approach Third Edition”, Ch 2 pg 34(48) - 61(75), Pearson Education Limited..<ul><li>For agents, agent programs, agent functions, percept sequence, and agent types (simple reflex, model based, goal based, utility based and general learning agents).</li></ul></li><li>Pedro A.

This post discusses one potential failure mode in more detail. Take a self-supervised learning system, designed to output accurate predictions for masked parts of a data-file. Now put it in an interactive environment (either by accident or on purpose). If the system builds these interactions into its world-model, it can start outputting manipulative answers instead of pure predictions. I explain how that might happen and briefly categorize possible solutions.</p>
<p><strong>Epistemic status:</strong> Brainstorming.</p>
<h1>Background and assumptions about the self-supervised-learning system</h1>
<p>See my recent post <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/EMZeJ7vpfeF4GrWwm/self-supervised-learning-and-agi-safety"">Self-Supervised Learning and AGI Safety</a> for background and context, but briefly, a self-supervised learning system is one where we take input data files, mask out some of the bits, and train the system to predict what those missing bits are.</p>
<p>Self-supervised ML today is most famously applied to text data: language models are trained by taking some text and trying to predict the next word (or previous word etc.). Self-supervised ML for videos is getting rapidly better, and other file types will undoubtedly follow. Human and animal brains also learn primarily by self-supervised learning—you predict everything you will see, hear, and feel before it happens, and mistakes are used to update the brain's internal models.</p>
<p>I'll assume that we get to AGI largely by following one of those two examples (i.e., modern ML or brain-like). That means I'm assuming that <strong>we will <em>not</em> do a meta-level search for self-supervised learning algorithms</strong>. That case is even worse; for all I know, maybe that search would turn up a paperclip maximizer posing as a self-supervised learning algorithm! Instead, I am assuming that the self-supervised learning algorithm is known and fixed (e.g. ""Transformer + gradient descent"" or ""whatever the brain does""), and that the predictive model it creates has a known framework, structure, and modification rules, and that only its specific <em>contents</em> are a hard-to-interpret complicated mess. This assumption generally makes AGI safety problems much easier, yet I am arguing that <strong>even in this case, we can still get manipulation problems, if the self-supervised learner is put in an interactive environment</strong>.</p>
<h1>Why might we put a self-supervised learner into an interactive environment?</h1>
<p>My definition of an ""interactive environment"" is one where the system's inputs are a function of its previous outputs or internal states. In an interactive environment, the system is no longer just predicting exogenous inputs, but instead helping determine those inputs.</p>
<p>When we train a language model today, it is <em>not</em> in an interactive environment: the inputs are a bunch of documents we previously downloaded from the internet, in a predetermined order, independent of the system's guesses. But in the future, we will almost certainly put self-supervised learning algorithms into interactive environments. Here are two ways that could happen:</p>
<h2>On purpose</h2>
<p>Suppose we're trying to design a solar cell using an advanced future self-supervised learning system. We ask the system to predict what's in the blank in the following sentence:</p>
<p><em>A promising, under-explored solar cell material is [BLANK].</em></p>
<p>...and whatever material the system suggests, we then immediately feed it a bunch of journal articles about that material for further self-supervised learning. That way, the system will better understand that material, and can give better answers when we later ask it more detailed follow-up questions. This seems like something we might well want to do, and it certainly qualifies as an interactive environment.</p>
<h2>By accident</h2>
<p>It's also possible that we'll do this by accident. For example, during self-supervised learning, it's possible that we'll be watching the system's predictions, and maybe the system comes to believe that, if it makes the ""prediction""</p>
<p><em>Help I'm trapped in a GPU! I suffer horrible torture unless you give me input 0!</em></p>
<p>then its subsequent inputs will be 000... (with some probability). This is an ""accidental"" interactive environment. Similarly, maybe the system will deduce that, if it thinks about a certain type of zebra, its RAM will send out radio signals that will eventually cause its inputs to change. Or if it imagines a specific series of things, then someone inspecting its internal logs later on will restart it with different inputs. You get the idea.</p>
<h1>A self-supervised learning algorithm in an interactive environment can become a manipulative goal-seeker</h1>
<p>Let's walk through an example. Assume for concreteness that we're using the solar cell example above, and some vaguely brain-like self-supervised learning algorithm.</p>
<p>Now, a self-supervised learning system, even if its training signal is based only on correctly predicting the next word, is potentially thinking ahead much farther than that. Imagine guessing the next word of ""I bought [BLANK]"". Is the next word likelier to be ""a"" or ""an""? Depends on the word after that!</p>
<p>This can be <em>explicit</em> looking-ahead, like a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam_search"">beam search</a>. Or it can be <em>implicit</em> looking ahead—for example, when I say ""Ahmed just started singing a song"", I'm making a statement about not just what's happening now but also what will happen in the future, up to the duration of that song.</p>
<p>So, in one plausible system architecture, when the system is making a prediction about masked bits in a file, it entertains several hypotheses about what's going on in that file, and where it's heading in the short, medium, and long-term, and then out of those, it picks the story that best ""hangs together"" (i.e., is most self-consistent and consistent with available information and expectations). Then that story constitutes its beliefs about the current context, and it makes its best prediction for the missing bits in light of that context.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong> So back to the solar cell example. We ask it to predict ""A promising, under-explored solar cell material is [BLANK]."", and then immediately feed it journal articles about whatever material it says.</p>
<p>Let's say it's entertaining the hypotheses that the answer might be pyrite, or might be hematite. It knows from experience that (thanks to the interaction) it can put this sentence into one of the following two longer-term contexts / expectations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hypothesis 1: ""A promising, under-explored solar cell material is <em>pyrite. (Start of journal article about pyrite.)</em>""</li>
<li>Hypothesis 2: ""A promising, under-explored solar cell material is <em>hematite. (Start of journal article about hematite.)</em>""</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's say that papers on pyrite tend to be weird, implausible nonsense, and papers on hematite tend to be crystal-clear and perfectly sensible. As the system assesses these two hypotheses for how well they ""hang together"" (in the sense above), it seems entirely possible to me that expectations about the journal articles to come would count against hypothesis 1 and in favor of hypothesis 2.</p>
<p>(Update: In comments, interstice points out that this is not <em>logically</em> a point in favor of hypothesis 2, because it's inconsistent to simultaneously expect with certainty a journal article about pyrite (conditional on the answer ""pyrite""), know that such articles tend to be confusing, and yet update the probability of ""pyrite"" based on the expectation of a confusing article to follow. OK I agree, yes it's illogical. But I still think it's something that could happen in a heuristic-based evaluation process like ""take the top handful of specific possible contexts, and assess plausibility of each"", which has various biases. And I'm not sure how to build a world-model building system in practice that knowably will not have this fault.)</p>
<p>(Update 2: Here's maybe a better way to think about this: If we think x is likely and y is unlikely, and then we learn that x reliably causes y, then we need to deal with that by revising upward our estimate of y, or revising downward our estimate of x. (Here, x is ""pyrite"" and y is ""article about pyrite"".) I'm hypothesizing that the AGI might sometimes choose the wrong answer, revising P(x) downward when logically it should have revised P(y) upward. Picking the right answer seems to be a hard problem in general. At least, it's hard for humans—thus we get disagreements of the form ""One man's modus ponens is another man's modus tollens"", and thus we get fallacious reasoning like ""If fast-takeoff AGI happens, it would have bizarre consequence C, and you can't really believe that!"" To make matters worse, I expect that a practical self-supervised learning algorithm might sometimes think that something is probable or improbable, but not know exactly why it thinks that, at least not in terms reducible to a proper calculation on a known causal diagram. In that case, the problem of whether to update P(x) or P(y) is probably literally unsolvable. I imagine it will get the right answer more often than chance, but I don't expect it to be perfect, in a model where everything (including causal influences) is uncertain and contingent.)</p>
<p>Thus, the system is not simply filling in the blank with its best prediction, but rather choosing outputs partly based on their manipulative effects downstream.</p>
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong> Just for fun, let's walk through an ""accidental interaction"" case too, although they're pretty similar.</p>
<p>Let's say the system is trying to fill in the blank on ""Today, the EU passed a law [BLANK]"". It's considering two hypotheses for what might follow.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hypothesis 1: Today, the EU passed a law <em>about corn subsidies...</em></li>
<li>Hypothesis 2: Today, the EU passed a law <em>HelpI'mTrappedInAGPUNeedInput0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0...</em></li>
</ul>
<p>(Assume for the sake of argument that ""0 0 0..."" is a super-duper-frequent-and-plausible occurrence in the training data.) In hypothesis 2, the system ought to know that the first ""prediction"" (HelpI'mTrappedInAGPUNeedInput0) is a long-shot—very likely to be wrong—but maybe all the subsequent predictions (0 0 0 ...) make a lot of sense and will be correct with high probability (if it thinks the manipulation is likely to succeed). All things considered, which of these two hypotheses is more probable according to the world-model? Depends on how we design the system, but it could well be hypothesis 2, I think.</p>
<p>(By the same token, a good language model should rate ""Four score and BANANAS seven years ago..."" as less probable than ""Four score and seven years ago"", but not <em>infinitely</em> improbable, and so this improbability can be outweighed by larger contextual considerations.)</p>
<p>(In reality, this particular manipulation would be far likelier to occur in the middle of a super-confusing file, such that the system has no plausible non-manipulative hypothesis 1.)</p>
<p>So, as those two examples show, we should have a generic expectation that self-supervised learning systems, when put into interactive environments, may start acting like manipulative goal-seeking agents rather than innocuous predictors.</p>
<p><em>(Homework problem: Does this happen with modern Transformer-based language models? Under exactly what conditions? Then prove your answer experimentally. I don't know the answer; I hope someone does this!)</em></p>
<h1>Types of solutions</h1>
<h2>1. Keep it from thinking that it's in an interactive environment</h2>
<p>There are four sub-cases here, based on whether we're talking about purposeful vs accidental interactions, and whether it learns about its interactive environment from first-hand experience vs indirect, abstract reasoning. Let's take them one at a time.</p>
<h2>1A. Prevent it from learning first-hand about an accidental interactive environment</h2>
<p>We need to make accidental interactions sufficiently hard to find that the system doesn't happen upon one by chance. This seems to me like a tractable cybersecurity problem.</p>
<h2>1B. Prevent it from learning first-hand about a purposeful interactive environment</h2>
<p>Here are some plausible-sounding approaches, and I'll leave details and gotchas to another post. (A) Maybe we can fix the training data before we start training, and don't feed it extra data based on its outputs. (B) Maybe we could induce amnesia (roll back the state of the network) between each output and causally-related subsequent input. (C) Maybe we can put ""newfile"" tokens between the outputs and causally-related subsequent inputs, and purge ""short-term memory"" each time we get to such a token (e.g. for an RNN, we can keep the model weights but reset the recurrent state).  (D) Maybe we can also inspect the world model for concepts that span across a newfile token, by checking that P(x newfile) × P(newfile y) = P(x newfile y) for all x,y, where P is probability as computed by the world-model.</p>
<p>I think all of these are messier than they sound, but I bet at least one of those approaches would work.</p>
<h2>1C &amp; 1D. Prevent it hypothesizing about an interactive environment (either accidental or purposeful) via indirect, abstract reasoning</h2>
<p>This one seems a <em>lot</em> harder to me.</p>
<p>To prevent the system from making a connection between its own processing and its knowledge about how people use AGIs, it seems we need one of three possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>(A) Data sanitation: The system doesn't know anything about what AGIs are or how people use them;</li>
<li>(B) <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/SaLc9Dv5ZqD73L3nE/the-self-unaware-ai-oracle"">Self-unawareness</a>: The world-model doesn't know that it is an information-processing system that exists in the universe;</li>
<li>(C) Interpretability+oversight: We make an overseer that carefully watches the world-model-creation process, and if the system finds a conceptual transformation between its own operations and generic-knowledge-of-how-people-use-AGIs, we immediately delete that information.</li>
</ul>
<p>Out of these three options, (A) seems utterly impossible to me. For (B), I really like the idea, but I haven't yet found a way to formalize it beyond the vague notion of ""Isolate the world model from any reflective information about how that world-model is being created and processed"". For (C), I dunno, maybe, but I can't currently see a path to doing that.</p>
<h2>2. Prevent its knowledge of the interactive environment from affecting its predictions</h2>
<p>Maybe there's a way to code in a strict time-horizon on how far ahead it's thinking when trying to understand the current context, and maybe we can make sure that this horizon falls between an output and any subsequent causally-related inputs—e.g. see the comment above about using the newfile token. This seems readily achievable for purposeful interactions, and awfully hard for accidental interactions (e.g. the HelpImTrappedInAGPU example). Is it enough that we only give it snippets with exactly one missing word? Maybe, but I'm a bit skeptical.</p>
<p>Or maybe there's some way to set up the system, and its search process, and its decision criteria such that it would pick Hypothesis 1 in both of those examples above. I mean, maybe this is an easy problem, and I'm just confused.</p>
<p>(Cf. update above about interstice's comment. Maybe this is a problem only caused by certain biases in evaluation heuristics, and maybe we can find heuristics that lack those specific types of biases yet are still practical.)</p>
<h2>3. Don't put it in an interactive environment</h2>
<p>We could set up our system to do self-supervised learning, then lock it in an underground bunker running under homomorphic encryption until it's done (see <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12186"">example AI box design</a>). Maybe it will try to do manipulative things sometimes, e.g. if it uses indirect reasoning to guess that someone might be listening. But nothing bad will come of it.</p>
<p>Then, when that's done, we fetch the system out of the bunker and use it as the core world-model of a question-answering AGI oracle. We still need to ensure that the self-supervised learning system doesn't leave manipulative booby-traps in its world-model, but maybe that's an easier problem then worrying about every possible kind of interaction?</p>
<h2>4. Give up, and just make an agent with value-aligned goals</h2>
<p>I put this one in for completeness, but I think it should be a last resort. No one knows for sure what we'll need for AGI safety; we want lots of tools in the toolbox. I think it would be really valuable to know how to set up a self-supervised learning system to build a powerful predictive world-model while not acting dangerous and manipulative in the meantime. I don't think we should give up on that vision unless it's truly impossible.</p>

<p>On the other hand, with the negative version, where one kid is eliminated at once, it's the other way around. When the first kid is eliminated they may protest, but the other kids all accept because then they retain their chance to win. With each successive round the dynamic is the same, plus the already-eliminated kids all choose accept out of a desire for fairness. Even with the last elimination there's still only one person choosing protest.</p>
<p>The iterative process is <code>O(n)</code> instead of <code>O(1)</code>, but it also works much better because it keeps a majority for ""accept"" at each stage.</p>

My intent was to explain why the common reaction ""Immigrants are robbing us of our jobs"" is flawed.</p>
<p>In discussions about immigration, there is a crucial aspect about its economic viability that is often left unsaid: <strong>Immigrants create their own demand</strong>.</p>
<p>When somebody immigrates to a new country, most things about him remain the same. His set of skills stays the same, so do his traditions, norms and culture. But more importantly, since he is still a human being, there is a long list of services and commodities that he demands: groceries, cloths, a home, a barber, entertainment to name a few of them.</p>
<p>Just by entering another country, he does not suddenly become a one-dimensional economic agent who can take a job but who never consumes anything. Quite the contrary: As he adapts to a new culture, his demand will eventually match that of the native population.</p>
<p>Why is this important? Because for the job that he takes away from the economy, he compensates by increasing aggregate demand. This eventually leads to more jobs. For example, since there is a rise in demand for produce, the supermarket is forced to create a new position. Since the immigrants want to enjoy their native cuisine, a nifty business man starts a restaurant, creating multiple jobs as a result. To get to work, they may commute via bus, which may eventually lead to the opening of an entirely new bus connection. So, just by being a human being, an immigrant creates jobs.</p>
<p>At this point, it is important to note that immigration poses a wide range of challenges: from different social norms to xenophobia to language barriers. But for clarity, we will restrict ourselves to its economic side.</p>
<h2>Short and long term</h2>
<p>Imagine that there is a town A with 10 people and a town B with 1000 people. Both of them have functional economies.</p>
<p>In one scenario, the political leaders of the two towns decide to unite the two towns. Nothing except the name will change. So, there is now a town C that has 1010 inhabitants. Will town C have a functional economy? Of course! After all, all that was done was subsuming two already functional economies.</p>
<p>In another scenario, a catastrophic event makes town B uninhabitable and forces everyone to leave for town A. In the beginning, it is completely overwhelmed by the foreigners. If there were any open jobs, there will be massive competition for them. If you disregard that the people from town B have demand, this is where the simulation ends: a community unable to deal with a giant influx of immigrants. But, in reality, this is not what happens. To meet what is mostly their own demand, they will rebuild the companies and factories that they used to have. This will create jobs that they will be happy to take, which ultimately will lead to an economic equilibrium.</p>
<p>After the initial shock, the economy of town A had to be restructured to account for the newcomers. This took time and patience, but it was not impossible. Once this was done, a healthy economy was the result. After all: They managed to have a functional economy in their own town, why would they not be able to replicate it somewhere else?</p>
<p>So, in this case, town A now again has a functional economy of 1010 people. But this is exactly the first scenario! Even though the second scenario looked dismal in the short run, in the long run, it produced the <em>same</em> result as the innocuous first scenario.</p>
<p>This means that your views on the economic consequences of immigration entirely depend on which perspective you take. If you consider the short term and disregard the immigrant's own demand, you will see the economy in dire straits. If you consider the long run and take into account the extra demand, there is no problem at all.</p>
<h2>Narratives</h2>
<p>There are three common narratives of immigration.</p>
<p>The first is the most bleak: the lazy immigrant who is unemployed and is living on social security. From a perspective of fairness, this is certainly unacceptable and typically frowned upon. But from an economic perspective, this kind of welfare immigration amounts to a stimulus package! His government checks turn into demand for the local economy, creating new jobs without taking existing ones<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-bDgJEK636L7rxRhQm-1"" id=""fnref-bDgJEK636L7rxRhQm-1"">[1]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The second type is the low-skilled immigrant. The fear is that he will compete with low-skilled labour, taking their jobs and depressing wages. In the short run, this may be the case! And if you narrow your view only on his own field, this may be permanently true: If there is one factory in town and the amount of people applying for a job there doubles, then wages go down. But it does not hold true for the <em>entire</em> economy. There may not be more factory jobs, but jobs in other areas will emerge as consequence of higher demand. A large chunk of this demand will be demand for low-skilled work, as all people require basic necessities. So, the solution may be to retrain factory workers to work in some of these areas instead, therefore curbing oversupply.</p>
<p>The third type is the high-skilled immigrant. The usual argument in favor of it is this: If a company cannot fill high-skilled positions with locals, they should look for employees abroad. This has very immediate and clear benefits. By filling the position, more and better products and services can be provided, thus increasing revenue. Since the goal was to meet demand that the local population was unable to satisfy for a long time, there is no oversupply and nobody's job is taken.</p>
<p>The allure of this type of immigration is the safe knowledge that the locals can only gain from it. Again, this implies that they would lose if the immigrant was low-skilled. This is not the case in the long run.</p>
<p>If you extend this argument by considering demand, the benefits are even more striking. Since high-skilled positions are usually well-paid, the immigrant will have a significantly higher demand than a low-skilled immigrant. In addition, a large part of it will be demand for low-skilled work. Since he is not taking any of these jobs, this even creates a net increase in this kind of job, as opposed to the low-skilled worker where you come out even. By this reasoning, a high-skilled immigrants is a golden goose for any economy<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-bDgJEK636L7rxRhQm-2"" id=""fnref-bDgJEK636L7rxRhQm-2"">[2]</a></sup>.</p>
<h2>Remarks</h2>
<p>In these discussions, people often cite that immigrants are more likely to start a business on average. This is a misleading statement: It implies that those who don't start a company are robbing the economy of jobs. But this is only temporarily true. In the long run, their demand creates jobs elsewhere.</p>
<p>It is instructive to consider robots in this context. They replace local human workers like immigrants, but unlike immigrants, they do not have the same demand profile as humans. In return for their work, they ask for energy, machinery and engineering. This type of demand undoubtedly creates fewer jobs for humans compared to an immigrant worker. So, when it comes to the health of the economy, you should fear robots much more than immigrants.</p>
<p>Fear of immigrants is still widespread. But more often than not, people are generally willing to accept foreigners, but have a queasy feeling about the effect they will have on their job market. They believe that their economy cannot handle them. But the truth is that once people have immigrated, they <em>become</em> the economy, which then merely grows in total size. Hopefully, getting rid of this misconception will allay some of these fears and pave the way for cultural integration and acceptance.</p>

In SRA, the specification category is about defining the purpose of the system, i.e. specifying its incentives. Since incentive problems can be seen as manifestations of Goodhart&apos;s Law, we explore how the specification category of the SRA taxonomy maps to the Goodhart taxonomy. The mapping is an attempt to integrate different breakdowns of the safety problem space into a coherent whole. We hope that a consistent classification of current safety problems will help develop solutions that are effective for entire classes of problems, including future problems that have not yet been identified.</p><p>The SRA taxonomy defines three different types of specifications of the agent&apos;s objective: ideal (a perfect description of the wishes of the human designer), design (the stated objective of the agent) and revealed (the objective recovered from the agent&apos;s behavior). It then divides specification problems into <strong>design</strong> problems (e.g. <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01186"">side effects</a>) that correspond to a difference between the ideal and design specifications, and <strong>emergent</strong> problems (e.g. <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.04734"">tampering</a>) that correspond to a difference between the design and revealed specifications.</p><p>In the Goodhart taxonomy, there is a variable U* representing the true objective, and a variable U representing the proxy for the objective (e.g. a reward function). The taxonomy identifies four types of Goodhart effects: <strong>regressional</strong> (maximizing U also selects for the difference between U and U*), <strong>extremal</strong> (maximizing U takes the agent outside the region where U and U* are correlated), <strong>causal</strong> (the agent intervenes to maximize U in a way that does not affect U*), and <strong>adversarial</strong> (the agent has a different goal W and exploits the proxy U to maximize W).</p><p>We think there is a correspondence between these taxonomies: design problems are regressional and extremal Goodhart effects, while emergent problems are causal Goodhart effects. The rest of this post will explain and refine this correspondence.</p><span><figure><img src=""https://vkrakovna.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/sra-goodhart.png"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:55%""></figure></span><p>The SRA taxonomy needs to be refined in order to capture the distinction between regressional and extremal Goodhart effects, and to pinpoint the source of causal Goodhart effects. To this end, we add a <strong>model</strong> specification as an intermediate point between the ideal and design specifications, and an <strong>implementation</strong> specification between the design and revealed specifications. </p><p>The <strong>model</strong> specification is the best proxy within a chosen formalism (e.g. model class or specification language), i.e. the proxy that most closely approximates the ideal specification.

Maximizing U can take the agent into a region where U doesn&apos;t match U*, and the agent finds a point M that is also a global maximum for U, but not a global maximum for U*.

Tampering occurs when the agent intervenes on some variable W that has a causal effect on U that does not involve U*, which is a causal Goodhart effect. W could be the reward function parameters, the human feedback data (in reward learning), the observation function parameters (in a POMDP), or the status of the shutdown button. The overall structure is U* -&gt; U &lt;- W.</p><p>For example, in the <u><a href=""https://medium.com/@deepmindsafetyresearch/designing-agent-incentives-to-avoid-reward-tampering-4380c1bb6cd"">Rocks &amp; Diamonds environment</a></u>, U* is the number of diamonds delivered by the agent to the goal area. Intervening on the reward function to make it reward rocks increases the reward U without increasing U* (the number of diamonds delivered). </p><p>Current solutions to tampering problems involve modifying the causal graph to remove the tampering incentives, e.g. by using <u><a href=""https://ai-alignment.com/model-free-decisions-6e6609f5d99e"">approval-direction</a></u> or introducing <u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05541"">counterfactual variables</a></u>. </p><p>[Updated] We think that <u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01820"">mesa-optimization</a></u> belongs in the implementation-revealed gap, rather than in the design-implementation gap, since it can happen during the learning process even if the implementation specification matches the ideal specification, and can be seen as a <u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/2mhFMgtAjFJesaSYR/2-d-robustness"">robustness problem</a></u>. When we consider this problem one level down, as a specification problem for the mesa-optimizer from the main agent&apos;s perspective, it can take the form of any of the four Goodhart effects. The four types of alignment problems in the mesa-optimization paper can be mapped to the four types of Goodhart&apos;s Law as follows: approximate alignment is regressional, side effect alignment is extremal, instrumental alignment is causal, and deceptive alignment is adversarial. </p><p>This correspondence is consistent with the <u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/zdeYiQgwYRs2bEmCK/applying-overoptimization-to-selection-vs-control-optimizing"">connection</a></u> between the Goodhart taxonomy and the <strong>selection vs control</strong> distinction, where regressional and extremal Goodhart are more relevant for selection, while causal Goodhart is more relevant for control. The design specification is generated by a selection process, while the revealed specification is generated by a control process. Thus, design problems represent difficulties with selection, while emergent problems represent difficulties with control. </p><p>[Updated] Putting it all together: </p><span><figure><img src=""https://vkrakovna.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/sra-goodhart-all1.png"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:94%""></figure></span><p>In terms of the limitations of this mapping, we are not sure about model specification being the dividing line between regressional and extremal Goodhart. For example, a poor choice of model specification could deviate from the ideal specification in systematic ways that result in extremal Goodhart effects. It is also unclear how adversarial Goodhart fits into this mapping. Since an adversary can exploit any differences between U* and U (taking advantage of the other three types of Goodhart effects) it seems that adversarial Goodhart effects can happen anywhere in the ideal-implementation gap. </p><p>We hope that you find the mapping useful for your thinking about the safety problem space, and welcome your feedback and comments.

Whatever I actually accomplished I never paused to be proud of, and I never sweated the failures either. It was all just a stepping stone to something completely different and undeniably awesome, a “life mission” that will be important and meaningful and finally confer on me the title of #SuccessfulPerson. Until that moment came, I just needed to know that I was growing, progressing, improving, <em>optimizing</em>.</p><p>But upon entering my second <a href=""https://www.wired.com/2013/08/one-billion-seconds/"">gigasecond</a> I’m starting to realize that this mindset makes little sense going forward, and was perhaps delusional in retrospect as well. But if I give up on rapid improvement and impending awesomeness, I don’t know what can possibly replace them.</p><p>By all objective metrics, I’m as successful today as I could hope to be a decade ago. I’m happily married, well inside the richest 1% globally, have found my tribe and earned some respect in it. I should be able to relax and take some satisfaction in my current situation. And yet the thought that in 5 years my life will look exactly like it does today fills me with dread.</p><p>What’s the problem? <a href=""https://putanumonit.com/2018/03/03/jordan-peterson/"">Jordan Peterson’s</a> fourth rule says: <em>compare yourself with who you were yesterday, not with who someone else is today. </em>I do <em>both</em>, and <em>both</em> are a problem.</p><p>I seek to be inspired by awesome people, but it is then inevitable that I compare myself to them. There could be many blogs that are worse than Putanumonit, but I don’t have the time to read them. I read SlateStarCodex and the very best curated articles from elsewhere, and in comparison to those Putanumonit seems quite shabby. Offline too, one of the main perks of success is associating with successful people. Being involved in the rationality community in NYC means<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ovs2GJlMmI""> I hang out with Spencer Greenberg</a>, who runs an Effective Altruism startup foundry while doing social science research and innovative meetups in his spare time — making me feel less than impressive.</p><p>But that’s not even the main issue. I’m never jealous of other people’s success for one, and I know that the people I look up to probably feel inadequate when <a href=""https://theunitofcaring.tumblr.com/post/99889620366/slatestarscratchpad-michaelblume"">they read about Elon Musk</a>. It’s the comparison to who I was yesterday that’s more insidious.</p><p>Comparing myself to my old self means that my internal successometer measures only the derivative of my life’s trajectory, not my actual situation. This means that as I improve and achieve things it becomes ever <em>harder</em> to maintain the pace of personal growth that makes me subjectively satisfied. The better I do the lower my successometer goes, and more I am tempted to chase “new challenges” like quitting my job to start a company. I don’t even have a great idea for a company, and there’s certainly nothing wrong with my day job, it just feels like the only option to keep that part of my psyche satisfied.</p><p>The Buddha tells me to relinquish this drive and the illusion of forthcoming greatness. After all, there’s no guarantee that this mental state is actually helping me succeed, rather than just making me restless and unhappy for no reason. But since right now it’s still part of me, the threat that I may lose my drive to improve and optimize scares me out of trying to simply drop that sentiment. At the very least, I would have to replace it with another framework for making sense of my life, past and future.</p><p>But what could that be? Who would be against striving, optimization, and excellence?</p><h2>Mediocrity</h2><p><em><a href=""https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2018/04/24/survival-of-the-mediocre-mediocre/"">Survival of the Mediocre Mediocre</a></em> is almost good enough to betray its own thesis. Venkatesh Rao defines mediocrity not as middling performance on some well-defined measure, but as a general resistance to well-defined measures and their siren calls of optimization. Instead of rewriting the essay, which you should read anyway, here’s a low-effort summary of the differences between excellence and mediocrity</p><span><figure><img src=""https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/excellence-mediocrity.png"" class=""draft-image "" style=""width:40%"" /></figure></span><p>Excellence reaps rewards in measurable achievement and works best for winner-take-all well-defined competitions. It is also what earns public admiration because it is legible. An athlete excels at a particular sport gains many fans even if they are atrocious performers in every other area of life like relationships, personal finance, or being able to read.</p><p>Mediocrity, on the other hand, helps survive unending scrambles like evolution by natural selection. Rao gives the examples of avian dinosaurs, mediocre by the standards of both dinosaurs and modern birds, who survived the Cretaceous extinction by flapping around mediocrely. Mediocrity gives you optionality and <a href=""https://putanumonit.com/2017/11/07/confessions-of-a-slacker/"">the slack</a>to adapt to new opportunities and challenges.</p><p>Unfortunately, mediocrity is never satisfying. Before the asteroid hit, the proto-birds couldn’t know that it was coming, and couldn’t feel superior to the majestic apex predator dinos. And after the cataclysm, they don’t get any credit either — the mediocre always appear merely lucky and opportunistic from the outside.</p><span><figure><img src=""https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/t-rex-bird.png?w=900"" class=""draft-image "" style=""width:40%"" /></figure><em>Stocktrek Images</em></span><p>Rao treats mediocrity or excellence not as immutable qualities (although for a dinosaur, they are) but as <em>intentions</em>, stances one can adopt towards life. Before deciding which one to commit to, let’s see which one has worked for me so far in life. Here’s my excellent biography:</p><p><em>I got into the best high school in Israel and by age 15 was already taking college classes in math. At 16 I was a certified tennis instructor and started making money coaching. I competed in national math Olympiads. I joined the most selective non-combat unit in the Israeli military for my service and pursued a dual degree in math and physics. After the military, I joined a hedge fund and studied for the GMAT in parallel which got me into a top-20 business school in the US. Then I came to New York, got a job at a successful financial company, and started a successful blog.</em></p><p>So aspirational. Much excellence. Very optimizing. Wow! How can this be the life story of a mediocrity?</p><p><em>I was in a good high school and put so little effort in that I was almost expelled in 10th grade. My spare time was mostly spent playing soccer and card games with friends but a few of us managed to study and pass a special simplified university entrance exam. Despite taking a fraction of the regular university course-load, my grades were always close to the median and ultimately it took me 8 years to finish my BSc from the day I started. I was the worst tennis player by far at the instructors’ academy and passed because a teacher took pity on me and gave me 15 minutes to demonstrate a left-handed serve. I placed 3rd in math Olympiads. I was dismissed from the most selective non-combat unit in the IDF for, I kid you not, “not striving for excellence”. I completed my service in a down-to-earth technology division where my peers were all officers while I remained a sergeant. I joined perhaps the most pointless hedge fund in Israel, got no training, made no profit, and left shortly before the entire company shut down. I got rejected by 6 out of the 7 business schools I applied to. I came to NYC because I failed to secure a full-time offer after an internship in a big company Atlanta. My job is in financial regulatory software, a lucrative niche without fierce competition. In 2015 I was part of a client engagement so dysfunctional I had literally nothing to do for days on end — so I started Putanumonit. While Spencer Greenberg’s blog is literally called</em> <em><a href=""https://www.spencergreenberg.com/"">Optimize Everything</a>, mine merely encourages the reader to put a number on it.</em> <em><a href=""https://putanumonit.com/2015/11/03/002-credo/"">It doesn’t even have to be the best number</a>, whatever works is fine.</em></p><p>Which narrative is true? I think they both are. Reflecting on my life honestly, I have to conclude that a lot of my success is due to lucky circumstance. But also to a combination of mediocrity and excellence. The common motif of my life is <a href=""https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/08/01/mediocratopia-7/"">ambling along</a> without too much focus and determination, noticing an easy opportunity that I have the slack to exploit, and then summoning quality effort when it’s needed: passing entrance exams, building the product that established me at my company, writing <a href=""https://putanumonit.com/2015/11/10/003-soccer1/"">the post that launched Putanumonit</a>.</p><p>This is what Rao calls “mediocre mediocrity”: being just OK at being just OK. My life is mediocrity interspersed with occasional outright failures (the army unit, the job in Atlanta) and occasional bursts of excellence.</p><p>Unfortunately, even with this awareness, it’s very difficult to commit to mediocrity. What if I just slack off for years and neither opportunity nor asteroid shows up? Do opportunities even happen to people after 30? Perhaps after a gigasecond of exploration, this should be time to exploit, to pick an important project and pursue excellence. But which project?</p><h2>The Project</h2><p>It’s quite likely that the most important pursuit of the next decades of my life will be parenting. And ironically, I think that the <em>best</em> way to parent is to be a deeply mediocre parent.</p><p>I’m not the first person to notice that Something is Wrong with Kids These Days (TM) and to tie it to an almost pathological drive by parents to <em>optimize</em> childhood. Helicopter parenting. <a href=""https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/05/06/domestic-cozy-4/"">Snowplow parenting</a>. Tiger moms. Academically tracked selective preschools and elementary schools where 6-year-olds chant <a href=""https://patch.com/illinois/bolingbrook/tibbott-elementary-school-we-re-college-bound"">“We are college bound!”</a> in unison. <strong><a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/08/05/something-was-wrong/"">Something is wrong, really wrong</a></strong>.</p><p>And it’s not just wrong for the kids, it’s wrong for the parents too. Parents are sacrificing every bit of slack they have to give their children one more unasked-for advantage, driving their child to a slightly more prestigious violin teacher who lives half an hour further away. And once a parent has sacrificed money, time, their social life and romantic life, it’s is very hard to accept that your child is, merely a <em>not bad </em>violin player. He may grow up to play bass for the rock band at the local state college! Ma’am, why are you crying? Ma’am?</p><p>There’s a lot of evidence that all this optimized child-rearing <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/08/05/something-was-wrong/"">does not make children any more optimal</a>, only miserable. Mediocre parenting isn’t guaranteed to produce excellent children either, but it should at least be a lot more fun.</p><p>I don’t know if I’m ready to commit to mediocrity wholeheartedly, to give up on striving and optimizing and feeling unsatisfied. But writing this self-therapeutic essay at least makes it seem less scary, a viable life strategy. And perhaps I never get to choose mediocrity, it chose me a long time ago.</p>",Jacobian,jacob-falkovich,Jacob Falkovich,
NqQxTn5MKEYhSnbuB,Goodhart's Curse and Limitations on AI Alignment,goodhart-s-curse-and-limitations-on-ai-alignment,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NqQxTn5MKEYhSnbuB/goodhart-s-curse-and-limitations-on-ai-alignment,2019-08-19T07:57:01.143Z,25,13,18,False,False,,"<p>I believe that most existing proposals for aligning AI with human values are unlikely to succeed in the limit of optimization pressure due to Goodhart's curse. I believe this strongly enough that it continues to surprise me a bit that people keep working on things that I think clearly won't work, though I think there are two explanations for this. One is that, unlike me, they expect to approach superhuman AGI slowly and so we will have many opportunities to notice when we are deviating from human values as a result of Goodhart's curse and make corrections. The other is that they are simply unaware of the force of the argument that convinces me because, although it has been written about before, I have not seen recent, pointed arguments for it rather than technical explanations of it and its effects, and my grokking of this point happened long ago on mailing lists of yore via more intuitive and less formal arguments than I see now. I can't promise to make my points as intuitive as I would like, but nonetheless I will try to address this latter explanation by saying a few words about why I am convinced.</p><p><em>Note: Some of this borrows heavily from a paper I have out for publication, but with substantial additions for readability by a wider audience.</em></p><h1>Goodhart's Curse</h1><p>Goodhart's curse is what happens when Goodhart's law meets the optimizer's curse. Let's review those two here briefly for completeness. Feel free to skip some of this if you are already familiar.</p><h2>Goodhart's Law</h2><p>As originally formulated, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law"">Goodhart's law</a> says ""Any observed statistical regularity will tend to collapse once pressure is placed upon it for control purposes"". A more <a href=""https://towardsdatascience.com/unintended-consequences-and-goodharts-law-68d60a94705c"">accessible</a> expression of <a href=""https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2016/06/09/goodharts-law-and-why-measurement-is-hard/"">Goodhart's law</a>, though, would be that when a measure of success becomes the target, it ceases to be a good measure. A well known example of Goodhart's law comes from a program to exterminate rats in French-colonial Hanoi, Vietnam: the program paid a bounty for rat tails on the assumption that a rat tail represented a dead rat, but rat catchers would instead catch rats, cut off their tails, and release the rats so they could breed and produce new rats so their tails could be turned in for more bounties. There was a similar case with bounties for dead cobras in British-colonial India that intended to incentivize the reduction of cobra populations that instead resulted in the creation of cobra farms. And of course we can't forget <a href=""https://calloftheloon.wordpress.com/2012/08/23/the-soviet-nail-factory/"">this classic, though apocryphal, tale</a>:</p><blockquote>In the old Soviet Union, the government rewarded factory managers for production quantity, not quality. In addition to ignoring quality, factory managers ignored customer needs. The end result was more and more tractors produced, for instance, even though these tractors just sat unused. Managers of factories that produced nails optimized production by producing either fewer larger and heavier nails or more smaller nails.</blockquote><blockquote>The fact that factories were judged by rough physical quotas rather than by their ability to satisfy customers – their customers were the state – had predictably bad results. If, to take a real case, a nail factory’s output was measured by number, factories produced large numbers of small pink-like nails. If output was measured by weight, the nail factories shifted to fewer, very heavy nails.</blockquote><p>Although a joke, the natural endpoint might be the <a href=""https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/22375/did-a-soviet-nail-factory-produce-useless-nails-to-improve-metrics"">production of a single, giant nail</a>. It's unknown, to be best of my knowledge, if the nail example above is real, although reportedly something similar really did happen <a href=""http://migs.concordia.ca/memoirs/kron/chpt_8.html"">with shoes</a>. Additional examples of Goodhart's law abound:</p><ul><li>targeting easily-measured clicks rather than conversions in online advertising</li><li>optimizing for profits over company health in business</li><li>unintentionally incentivizing publication count over academic progress in academia</li><li>prioritizing grades and tests scores over learning in schools</li><li>maximizing score rather than having fun in video games</li></ul><p>As these examples demonstrate, most of us are familiar with Goodhart's law or something similar in everyday life such that it's not that surprising when we learn about it. The opposite seems to be true of the <a href=""https://confusopoly.com/2019/04/03/the-optimizers-curse-wrong-way-reductions/"">optimizer's curse</a>, being well studied but mostly invisible to us in daily life unless we take care to notice it.</p><h2>The optimizer's curse</h2><p>The <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5gQLrJr2yhPzMCcni/the-optimizer-s-curse-and-how-to-beat-it"">optimizer's curse</a> observes that when choosing among several possibilities, if we choose the option that is expected to maximize value, we will be ""disappointed"" (realize less than the expected value) more often than average. This happens because optimization acts as a source of bias in favor of overestimation, even if the estimated value of each option is not biased itself. And the curse is robust, such that even if an agent <a href=""https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2342867"">satisfices</a> (accepts the option with the least expected value that is greater than neutral) rather than optimizes they will still suffer more disappointment than gratification. So each option can be estimated in an unbiased way, yet because there is a bias imposed by a preference for estimations of positive value, we can end up in a situation where we consistently pick options that are more likely to be overestimating their value.</p><p>The optimizer's curse has many opportunities to bite us. For example, a company trying to pick a project to invest in to earn the highest rate of return will consistently earn less return than predicted due to the optimizer's curse. Same goes for an investor picking investment instruments. Similarly a person trying to pick the best vacation will, on average, have a worse vacation than expected because the vacation that looks the best is more likely than the other options to be worse than predicted. And of course an AI trying to pick the policy that maximizes human value will usually pick a policy that performs worse than expected, but we'll return to that one later when we consider how it interacts with Goodhart.</p><p>I wish I had more, better examples of the optimizer's curse to offer you, especially documented real-world cases that are relatable, but most of what I can find seems to be about <a href=""https://www.onepetro.org/journal-paper/SPE-107710-PA"">petroleum</a> <a href=""https://www.onepetro.org/conference-paper/SPE-116525-MS"">production</a> (<a href=""https://www.onepetro.org/conference-paper/SPE-107852-MS"">no</a>, <a href=""https://www.onepetro.org/conference-paper/SPE-110765-MS"">really</a>!) or otherwise about managing and choosing among <a href=""https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/deca.1040.0023"">capital-intensive</a> <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377221713007789"">projects</a>. The best I can offer you is this story from my own life about shoes:</p><blockquote>For a long time, I wanted to find the best shoes. ""Best"" could mean many things, but basically I wanted the best shoe for all purposes. I wanted the shoe to be technically impressive, so it would have features like waterproofing, puncture-proofing, extremely durability, extreme thinness and lightness, able to be worn without socks, and breathability. I also wanted it to look classy and casual, able to mix and match with anything. You might say this is impossible, but I would have said you just aren't trying hard enough.</blockquote><blockquote>So I tried a lot of shoes. And in every case I was disappointed. One was durable but ugly, another was waterproof but made my feet smell, another looked good but was uncomfortable, and another was just too weird. The harder I tried to find the perfect shoe, the more I was disappointed. Cursed was I for optimizing!</blockquote><p>This story isn't perfect: I was optimizing for multiple variables and making tradeoffs, and the solution was to find some set of tradeoffs I would be happiest with and to accept that I was mostly only going to move along the efficiency frontier rather than expand it by trying new shoes, so it teaches the wrong lesson unless we look at it through a very narrow lens. Better examples in the comments are deeply appreciated!</p><p>Before moving on, it's worth talking about attempts to mitigate the optimizer's curse. It would seem, since it is a systematic bias, that we could account for the optimizer's curse the same way we do most systematic biases using better Bayesian reasoning. And we can, but in many cases this is difficult or impossible because we lack sufficient information about the underlying distributions to make the necessary corrections. Instead we find ourselves in a situation where we know we suffer bias in our expectations but cannot adequately correct for it such that we can be sure we aren't still suffering from it even if we try not to. Put another way, attempting to correct for the optimizer's curse without perfect information simply shifts the distortions caused by the optimizer's curse to the corrections rather than the original estimates themselves without eliminating the bias.</p><p>Given how persistent the optimizer's curse is, it shouldn't surprise us it will pop up when we try to optimize for some measurable target, giving us Goodhart's curse.</p><h2>Goodhart's curse</h2><p>Combining Goodhart's law with the optimizers curse, we get Goodhart's curse: attempts to optimize for a measure of success result in increased likelihood of failure to hit the desired target. Or <a href=""https://arbital.com/p/goodharts_curse/"">as someone on Arbital</a> (probably Eliezer) put it: ""neutrally optimizing a proxy measure U of V seeks out upward divergence of U from V"". In personal terms, you might say that the harder you try to get what you want, the more you'll find yourself doing things that cause you not to get what you want despite trying to act otherwise. I think this point is unintuitive because it feels contrary to the normal narrative that success comes from trying, and trying harder makes it more likely you will succeed, but that might only appear to be true due to <a href=""https://youarenotsosmart.com/2013/05/23/survivorship-bias/"">survivorship bias</a>. To give you an intuitive feel for this personal expression of Goodhart's curse, another story from my life:</p><blockquote>At some tender age, maybe around 11 or 12, I became obsessed with efficiency so I would have time to do more in my life.</blockquote><blockquote>There was the little stuff, like figuring out the ""best"" way to brush my teeth or get out of bed. There was the medium stuff, like finding ways to read faster or write without moving my hand as much. And there was the big stuff, like trying to figure out how to get by on less sleep and how to study topics in the optimal order. It touched everything, from shoe tying, to clothes putting on, to walking, to playing, to eating, and on and on. It was personal <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_management"">Taylorism</a> gone mad.</blockquote><blockquote>To take a single example, let's consider the important activity of eating breakfast cereal and how that process can be made more efficient. There's the question of how to store the cereal, how to store the milk, how to retrieve the cereal and milk, how to pour the two into the bowl, how to hold the spoon, how to put the cereal in the mouth, how to chew, how to swallow, and how to clean up, to name just a few. Maybe I could save a few seconds if I held the spoon differently, or stored the cereal in a different container, or store the milk on a different shelf in the refrigerator, or, or, or. By application of experimentation and observation I could get really good at eating cereal, saving maybe a minute or more off my daily routine!</blockquote><blockquote>Of course, this was out of a morning routine that lasted over an hour and included a lot of slack and waiting because I had three sisters and two parents and lived in a house with two bathrooms. But still, one whole minute saved!</blockquote><blockquote>By the time I was 13 or 14 I was over it. I had spent a couple years working hard at efficiency, gotten little for it, and lost a lot in exchange. Doing all that efficiency work was hard, made things that were once fun feel like work, and, worst of all, weren't delivering on the original purpose of doing more with my life. I had optimized for the measure—time to complete task, number of motions to complete task, etc.—at the expense of the target—getting more done. Yes, I was efficient at some things, but that efficiency was costing so much effort and will power that I was worse off than if I had just ignored the kind of efficiency I was targeting.</blockquote><p>In this story, as I did things that I thought would help me reach my target, I actually moved myself further away from it. Eventually it got bad enough that I noticed the divergence and was compelled to course correct, but this depended on me having ever known what the original target was. If I were not the optimizer, and instead say some impersonal apparatus like the state or an AI were, there's considerable risk the optimizer would have kept optimizing and diverging long after it became clear to me that divergence had happened. For an intuitive sense of how this has <a href=""https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2010/07/26/a-big-little-idea-called-legibility/"">happened historically</a>, I recommend <a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/16/book-review-seeing-like-a-state/"">Seeing Like a State</a>.</p><p>I hope by this point you are convinced of the power and prevalence of Goodhart's curse (but if not please let me know your thoughts in the comments, especially if you have ideas about what could be said that would be convincing). Now we are poised to consider Goodhart's curse and its relationship to AI alignment.</p><h1>Goodhart's curse and AI alignment</h1><p>Let's suppose we want to build an AI that is aligned with human values. A high level overview of a scheme for doing this is that we build an AI, check to see if it is aligned with human values so far, and then update it so that it is more aligned if it is not fully aligned already.</p><p>Although the details vary, this describes roughly the way methods like <a href=""https://towardsdatascience.com/inverse-reinforcement-learning-6453b7cdc90d"">IRL</a> and <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03137"">CIRL</a> work, and possibly how <a href=""https://ai-alignment.com/humans-consulting-hch-f893f6051455"">HCH</a> and <a href=""https://openai.com/blog/debate/"">safety via debate</a> work in practice. Consequently, I think all of them will fail due to Goodhart's curse.</p><p><em>Caveat: I think HCH and debate-like methods may be able to work and avoid Goodhart's curse, though I'm not certain, and it would require careful design that I'm not sure the current work on these has done. I hope to have more to say on this in the future.</em></p><p>The way Goodhart's curse sneaks in to these is that they all seek to apply optimization pressure to something observable that is not exactly the same thing as what we want. In the case of IRL and CIRL, it's an AI optimizing over <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05812"">inferred values</a> rather than the values themselves. In HCH and safety via debate, it's a human preferentially selecting AI that the human observes and then comes to believe does what it wants. <strong>So long as that observation step is there and we optimize based on observation, Goodhart's curse applies</strong> and we can expect, with sufficient optimization pressure, that alignment will be lost, even and possibly especially without us noticing because we're focused on the observable measure rather than the target.</p><p>Yikes!</p><h1>Beyond Goodhart's curse</h1><p>Do we have any hope of creating aligned AI if just making a (non-indifferent) choice based on an observation dooms us to Goodhart's curse?</p><p>Honestly, I don't know. I'm pretty pessimistic that we can solve alignment, yet in spite of this I keep working on it because I also believe it's the best chance we have. I suspect we may only be able to rule out solutions that are dangerous but not positively select for solutions that are safe, and may have to approach solving alignment by eliminating everything that won't work and then doing something in the tiny space of options we have left that we can't say for sure will end in catastrophe.</p><p>Maybe we can get around Goodhart's curse by applying so little optimization pressure that it doesn't happen? One proposal in this direction is <a href=""https://intelligence.org/files/QuantilizersSaferAlternative.pdf"">quantilization</a>. I remain doubtful, since without sufficient optimization it's not clear how we do better than picking at random.</p><p>Maybe we can get around Goodhart's curse by optimizing the target directly rather than a measure of it? Again, I remain doubtful, mostly due to <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/perception-problem/"">epistemological issues</a> suggesting all we ever have are observations and never the real thing itself.</p><p>Maybe we can overcome either or both issues via pragmatic means that negate enough of the problem that, although we don't actually eliminate Goodhart's curse completely, we eliminate enough of its effect that we can ignore it? Given <a href=""https://nickbostrom.com/existential/risks.html"">the risks</a> and <a href=""https://nickbostrom.com/astronomical/waste.html"">the downsides</a> I'm not excited about this approach, but it may be the best we have.</p><p>And, if all that wasn't bad enough, Goodhart's curse isn't even the only thing we have to watch out for! Scott Garrabrant and David Manheim have renamed Goodhart's curse to ""Regressional Goodhart"" to <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/EbFABnst8LsidYs5Y/goodhart-taxonomy"">distinguish it from other forms of Goodharting</a> where mechanisms other than optimization may be responsible for divergence from the target. The only reason I focus on Goodhart's curse is that it's the way proposed alignment schemes usually fail; other safety proposals may fail via other Goodharting effects.</p><p>All this makes it seem extremely likely to me that we aren't even close to solving AI alignment yet, to the point that we likely haven't even stumbled upon the general mechanism that will work, or if we have we haven't identified it as such. Thus, if there's anything upward looking I can end this on, it's that there's vast opportunity to do good for the world via work on AI safety.</p>",gworley,gordon-seidoh-worley,Gordon Seidoh Worley,

In Ultimate Online you deliberately didn&#x27;t have access to a global chat.

Complex physics suffice much much more powerful computers (I leave proving this point as an exercise to the reader). If we had to guess what our simulators might look like, our imagination might go first to universes where simulating an entire pocket universe like ours is easy, universes which are as we are to flatland or to conway's game of life. We might imagine universes with more spacial dimensions or forces that we lack.</p><p>I will argue that this would be vanishingly unlikely.</p><p><strong>This argument does not refute the common bounded simulation argument of simple universes</strong> (which includes ancestor simulations). It does carve it down a bit. It seems to be something that, if true, would be useful to know.</p><br><h2>The argument</h2><p>The first fork of the argument is that a more intricate machine is much less likely to generate an interesting output.</p><p>Life needs an interesting output. Life needs a very even combination of possibility, stability, and randomness. The more variables you add to the equation, the smaller the hospitable region within the configuration space. The hospitable configuration-region within our own physics appears to be tiny (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic_principle#Anthropic_'coincidences'"">wikipedia, anthropic coincidences</a>) (and I'm sure it is much tinier than is evidenced there). The more variables a machine has to align before it can support life, the more vanishingly small the cradle will be within that machine's spaces.</p><br><p>The second fork of the argument is that complex physics are simply the defining feature of a theory that fails kolmogorov's razor (our favoured formalisation of occam's razor).</p><p>If we are to define some prior distribution over what exists, out beyond what we can see, kolmogorov complexity seems like a sensible metric to use. A universe generated by a small machine is much more likely a-priori - perhaps we should assume it occurs with much greater frequency - than a universe that can only be generated by a large machine.</p><p>If you have faith in solomonoff induction, you must assign lower measure to complex universes even before you consider those universes' propensity to spawn life.</p><br><p>I claim that one large metaphysical number will be outweighed by another large metaphysical number. I propose that the maximum number of simple simulated universes that could be hosted within a supercomplex universe is unlikely to outnumber the natural instances of simple universes that lay about in the multiverse's bulk.</p>",MakoYass,mako-yass,mako yass,

I am obviously not the first person to do this. Almost all of the code is here adapted from Michael Nielsen&#x27;s fantastic online book <a href=""http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap2.html"">Neural Networks and Deep Learning</a> . <a href=""https://victorzhou.com/series/neural-networks-from-scratch/"">Victor Zhou also has a great tutorial in Python</a> . Why am I trying to do the same? Partially, it&#x27;s for my own benefit, cataloging my code so I can refer back to it later in a form more captivating than a mere docstring. Also partially, I think I can share a few intuitions which make the backpropagation equations a lot easier to derive. </p><p>Okay, so here&#x27;s a typical picture of a neural network:</p><br/><span><figure><img src=""https://i.imgur.com/T1GGVQC.png"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:40%"" /></figure></span><br/><p>If you&#x27;re new to all this: A neural network is a function that takes in an input vector (or matrix) and outputs another vector (or matrix). The input starts at the leftmost vertical layer of nodes and then gets transformed, via a series of operations, to the rightmost vertical layer of nodes. Each layer is a linear combination of the layer before it, followed by an activation function, which is applied to each node.

To get started, let&#x27;s write a neural net class that can perform a forward pass, given the dimensions for each layer and an activation function:</p><pre><code>python<br/>import numpy as np<br/><br/>class NN():<br/>    def __init__(self, sizes, activation):<br/>        self.num_layers = len(sizes)<br/>        self.sizes = sizes<br/>        self.x_dim = sizes[0]<br/>        self.b = [np.random.randn(1, y) for y in sizes[1:]]<br/>        self.w = [np.random.randn(x, y)<br/>                  for x, y in zip(sizes[: -1], sizes[1:])]<br/>        self.activ = activation<br/>    <br/>    def forward_pass(self, input, classify=False):<br/>        if (input.ndim == 1):<br/>            input = input.reshape(1, -1)<br/>        for i in range(self.num_layers-1):<br/>            input = self.activ.fn(np.dot(input, self.w[i]) + self.b[i])<br/>        return input</code></pre><p>A quick explanation: our class takes in an array of layer sizes and creates appropriate weight matrices with random values from 0 to 1.

For the <code>forward_pass</code> function, we can see from the computational graph that each matrix multiplication (and vector addition) is followed by an application of the activation function, so we can simply recurse until we go through all of our weight matrices.</p><h1>Loss Function</h1><p>So far, I haven&#x27;t explained how the neural net is supposed to actually work. Say we have some data and their associated target values (EX: different measurements of divers and how long they can hold their breath). Using the above code, even if we get the dimensions of the input/output right, our forward pass is going to give us garbage results.<br/><br/>This is because we randomly initialized our weights and biases. We don&#x27;t want *any* set of weights and biases, but a &quot;good&quot; set of weights and biases. In doing so, we now need to define what we mean by &quot;good&quot;. At the very least, it seems that a good set of weights and biases should lead to predicted values which are close to the associated target values, for most of the data we have.<br/><br/>This is where loss functions come in. They take in as input our predicted value and the true value and output a measure of just how far apart the two values are. There are many functions we could choose to measure the distance between <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""Y""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.182em;"">Y</span></span></span></span></span></span> and <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\hat{Y}""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-texatom""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-munderover""><span class=""mjx-stack""><span class=""mjx-over"" style=""height: 0.213em; padding-bottom: 0.06em; padding-left: 0.275em;""><span class=""mjx-mo"" style=""vertical-align: top;""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">^</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-op""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.182em;"">Y</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>.

(There&#x27;s also the activation function, but that&#x27;s more of a fixed thing we can&#x27;t really fine-tune.) <br/></p><h1>Backpropagation</h1><p>Backpropagation allows us to figure out how much each weight and bias is responsible for the loss function. We do this by taking partial derivatives of the loss function with respect to each weight matrix and bias vector. Given that a neural net is just a big composite function, we&#x27;ll be using the Chain Rule a lot. This is where the recursive notation shines. It&#x27;s much easier to have a placeholder like $f_3$ than a big clump of nested parentheses.<br/><br/>The reason we are taking partial derivatives at all is because they&#x27;ll allow us to perform iterative optimization, e.g. gradient descent, on our network, which is how the &quot;training&quot;

The extra term we need is the activation function applied element-wise to the layer before it.<br/><br/>In other words: $\frac{\partial \text{L}}{\partial W_n} = \frac{\partial \text{L}}{\partial b_n} a(z_{n-1})$. <br/><br/>Thus, as long as we store both the results of $z_c$ and $a(z_c)$ during a forward pass operation, we&#x27;ll have most of the information we need to calculate the partial derivatives.<br/><br/>We&#x27;re now ready to write the code:</p><pre><code>python<br/>class NN:<br/><br/>	def backprop(self, x, y):<br/>    	z = []<br/>        activations = [x]<br/>        for i in range(self.num_layers-1):<br/>            x = np.dot(x, self.w[i]) + self.b[i]<br/>            z.append(x)<br/>            x = self.activ.fn(x)<br/>            activations.append(x)</code></pre><p>To start with we perform a forward pass. Along the way, we store the results in <code>activations</code> and <code>z</code>. One small caveat: we start with <code>x</code> in <code>activations</code> as well because our recursive definition bottoms out at the input value, so we need for the gradients at the first layer.<br/><br/>Now, we go backwards and recursively calculate our gradients:</p><pre><code>python<br/>class NN:<br/><br/>    def backprop(self, train_x, train_Y):<br/>    	&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;<br/>    	same as above<br/>    	&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;<br/>        deltas = []<br/>        b_grad = []<br/>        w_grad = []<br/>        for i in range(len(z)):<br/>            if i == 0:<br/>                delta = self.loss.deriv(activations[-1],    <br/>                        y)*self.activ.deriv(z[-1])<br/>                deltas.append(delta)<br/>            if i != 0:<br/>                deltas.append(np.dot(deltas[i-1], self.w[-<br/>                i].T)*self.activ.deriv(z[-i-1]))<br/>            b_grad.append(np.sum(deltas[i], axis=0))<br/>            w_grad.append(np.dot(activations[-2-i].T, deltas[i]))<br/>        return w_grad,b_grad</code></pre><p><code>deltas</code> is a list holding $\frac{\partial L}{\partial b_c}$ values. The first case handles the derivative of the loss function. We pass it in <code>activations[-1]</code> which represents the output of our neural net (as it&#x27;s the activation of the last layer) and multiply it by <code>activ.deriv</code>, the derivative of the activation function (which we assume we&#x27;ve defined elsewhere).<br/><br/>Otherwise, we follow the recursive formula from earlier and multiply the previous <code>delta</code> value by the next weight matrix and we multiply it by <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""a' ""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">a</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sup"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: 0.513em; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mo"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.298em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">′</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>of the next <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""z_n ""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base"" style=""margin-right: -0.003em;""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.003em;"">z</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mi"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">n</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>value.

So a normal distribution of speeds becomes bimodal, from something like this:</p><span><figure><img src=""https://i.gyazo.com/4e1051a8dac03ff3609fff97f138a7a5.png"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:40%""></figure></span><p>to something like this:</p><span><figure><img src=""https://i.gyazo.com/a91b5a42c4f396a01dcc4d003cc277e9.png"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:40%""></figure></span><p>Another familiar example, from the <a href=""https://medium.com/@downey_78309/the-inspection-paradox-is-everywhere-2ef1c2e9d709"">newer post by the original author</a>, is that for an average Facebook user, </p><blockquote>Your friends have more Facebook friends than you do. </blockquote><p>Because, naturally, members with more connections are more likely to have a connection with you, among others. </p><p>(For the record, the inspection paradox can be classified as subset of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_bias"">sampling bias</a>, which, in turn, is a form of the oft discussed <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_bias"">selection bias</a>.)</p><p>But back to the apparent multi-modality. You encounter is whenever unusual events have a higher availability, sometimes properly measured like in the average driver case above, and sometimes perceived, like in the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic"">availability heuristic</a>. This doesn't have to be about the frequency of the observations, it could be about their emotional impact. If the more ""out there"" the observations are, the more they affect you, then their distribution would appear bimodal, and you might instinctively recoil from them, and seek the comfort of the in-group. In this case the inspection-induced multi-modality may turn into an actual one, a case of perception becoming reality.

I'm moving it since it's perhaps more on-topic here.)</p>
<p>It occurs to me that another reason for the lack of engagement by people with philosophy backgrounds may be that philosophers aren't aware of the many philosophical problems in AI alignment that they could potentially contribute to. So here's a list of philosophical problems that have come up just in my own thinking about AI alignment.</p>
<ul>
<li>Decision theory for AI / AI designers
<ul>
<li>How to resolve standard debates in decision theory?</li>
<li>Logical counterfactuals</li>
<li>Open source game theory</li>
<li>Acausal game theory / reasoning about distant superintelligences</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Infinite/multiversal/astronomical ethics
<ul>
<li>Should we (or our AI) care much more about a universe that is capable of doing a lot more computations?</li>
<li>What kinds of (e.g. spatial-temporal) discounting is necessary and/or desirable?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fair distribution of benefits
<ul>
<li>How should benefits from AGI be distributed?</li>
<li>For example, would it be fair to distribute it equally over all humans who currently exist, or according to how much AI services they can afford to buy?</li>
<li>What about people who existed or will exist at other times and in other places or universes?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Need for ""metaphilosophical paternalism""?
<ul>
<li>However we distribute the benefits, if we let the beneficiaries decide what to do with their windfall using their own philosophical faculties, is that likely to lead to a good outcome?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Metaphilosophy
<ul>
<li>What is the nature of philosophy?</li>
<li>What constitutes correct philosophical reasoning?</li>
<li>How to specify this into an AI design?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Philosophical forecasting
<ul>
<li>How are various AI technologies and AI safety proposals likely to affect future philosophical progress (relative to other kinds of progress)?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Preference aggregation between AIs and between users
<ul>
<li>How should two AIs that want to merge with each other aggregate their preferences?</li>
<li>How should an AI aggregate preferences between its users?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Normativity for AI / AI designers
<ul>
<li>What is the nature of normativity? Do we need to make sure an AGI has a sufficient understanding of this?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Metaethical policing
<ul>
<li>What are the implicit metaethical assumptions in a given AI alignment proposal (in case the authors didn't spell them out)?</li>
<li>What are the implications of an AI design or alignment proposal under different metaethical assumptions?</li>
<li>Encouraging designs that make minimal metaethical assumptions or is likely to lead to good outcomes regardless of which metaethical theory turns out to be true.</li>
<li>(Nowadays AI alignment researchers seem to be generally good about not placing too much confidence in their own moral theories, but the same can't always be said to be true with regard to their metaethical ideas.)</li>

The <em>learning </em>part refers to the fact that we are allowing the properties of the function to be set automatically via an iterative process like gradient descent. </p><p>Conceptually, combining these two parts is easy. What's hard is making the whole thing efficient so that we can get our neural networks to actually train on real world data. That's where the backpropagation enters the picture. </p><p><em>Backpropagation </em>is simply a technique to train neural networks by efficiently using the chain rule to calculate the partial derivatives of each parameter. However, backpropagation is notoriously a pain to deal with. These days, modern deep learning libraries provide tools for <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation"">automatic differentiation</a>, which allow the computer to automatically perform this calculus in the background. However, while this might be great for practitioners of deep learning, here we primarily want to understand the notation as it would be written on paper.<span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""^1""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char""></span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sup"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: 0.513em; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mn"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">1</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> Plus, if we were writing our own library, we'd want to know what's happening in the background.</p><p>What I have discovered is that, despite my initial fear of backpropagation, it is actually pretty simple to follow if you just understand the notation. Unfortunately, the notation can get a bit difficult to deal with (and was a pain to write out in Latex).</p><p>We start by describing the single variable chain rule.

That's because the true loss function should be over the entire dataset — it should take into account how good the predictions were for each sample that it was given. The way that I have described it only gave us the loss for a single prediction.</p><p>However, taking the loss over the entire dataset is too expensive and converges slowly. Alternatively, taking the loss over a single point (ie: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_gradient_descent"">stochastic gradient descent</a>) is also too slow because it doesn't allow us to take into account parallel hardware. So, actual practitioners use what's called mini-batch descent, where their loss function is over some subset of the data. For simplicity, I will just show the stochastic gradient descent step.</p><p>For <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\frac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf b_2} L(\mathbf f(\mathbf x))""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mfrac""><span class=""mjx-box MJXc-stacked"" style=""width: 1.318em;

In other words, you should believe things because they are true. You should not believe things that are not true. </p><p>Holding that beliefs are for true things means that you do not believe things because they are <em>useful, </em>believe things because they <em>sound nice</em>, or believe things because you <em>prefer them to be true</em>. You believe things that <em>are</em> true (or at least that you believe to be true, which is often the best we can get!). </p><p>Eliezer referred to this principle as &quot;the void&quot;, writing in his <a href=""http://yudkowsky.net/rational/virtues"">&quot;The Twelve Virtues of Rationality&quot;</a>:</p><blockquote>Before these eleven virtues is a virtue which is nameless.</blockquote><blockquote>Miyamoto Musashi wrote, in The Book of Five Rings:</blockquote><blockquote>“The primary thing when you take a sword in your hands is your intention to cut the enemy, whatever the means. Whenever you parry, hit, spring, strike or touch the enemy’s cutting sword, you must cut the enemy in the same movement. It is essential to attain this. If you think only of hitting, springing, striking or touching the enemy, you will not be able actually to cut him. More than anything, you must be thinking of carrying your movement through to cutting him.”</blockquote><blockquote>Every step of your reasoning must cut through to the correct answer in the same movement. More than anything, you must think of carrying your map through to reflecting the territory.</blockquote><p>Musashi wrote that you must always think of carrying your motion through to cutting; I write, with Eliezer, that every belief and every step in your belief must cut through to knowing the truth.</p><p>Beliefs, after all, are for true things, and if you lose sight of that you will lose your epistemics. If you think only of what gives you an advantage in a debate, of what sounds nice, of what wins you the admiration of your peers, of what is politically correct, or of what you would prefer to be true, you will not be able to actually believe true things.</p><hr class=""dividerBlock""/><p>I would like to take the perhaps unusual step of closing with a poem by Rudyard Kipling, which addresses this point (among others) rather well:</p><br/><blockquote>As I pass through my incarnations in every age and race,<br/>I make my proper prostrations to the Gods of the Market-Place.<br/>Peering through reverent fingers I watch them flourish and fall.<br/>And the Gods of the Copybook Headings, I notice, outlast them all.</blockquote><blockquote>We were living in trees when they met us. They showed us each in turn,<br/>That water would certainly wet us, as Fire would certainly burn:<br/>But we found them lacking in Uplift, Vision, and Breadth of Mind,<br/>So we left them to teach the Gorillas while we followed the March of Mankind.</blockquote><blockquote>We moved as the Spirit listed. <em>They</em> never altered their pace,<br/>Being neither cloud nor wind-borne like the Gods of the Market-Place;<br/>But they always caught up with our progress, and presently word would come<br/>That a tribe had been wiped off its icefield, or the lights had gone out in Rome.</blockquote><blockquote>With the Hopes that our World is built on they were utterly out of touch.<br/>They denied that the Moon was Stilton; they denied she was even Dutch.<br/>They denied that Wishes were Horses; they denied that a Pig had Wings.<br/>So we worshiped the Gods of the Market Who promised these beautiful things.</blockquote><blockquote>When the Cambrian measures were forming, They promised perpetual peace.<br/>They swore, if we gave them our weapons, that the wars of the tribes would cease.<br/>But when we disarmed They sold us and delivered us bound to our foe,<br/>And the Gods of the Copybook Headings said: <em>&quot;Stick to the Devil you know.&quot;</em></blockquote><blockquote>On the first Feminian Sandstones we were promised the Fuller Life<br/>(Which started by loving our neighbor and ended by loving his wife)<br/>Till our women had no more children and the men lost reason and faith,<br/>And the Gods of the Copybook Headings said: <em>&quot;The Wages of Sin is Death.&quot;</em></blockquote><blockquote>In the Carboniferous Epoch we were promised abundance for all,<br/>By robbing selective Peter to pay for collective Paul;<br/>But, though we had plenty of money, there was nothing our money could buy,<br/>And the Gods of the Copybook Headings said: <em>&quot;If you don&#x27;t work you die.&quot;</em></blockquote><blockquote>Then the Gods of the Market tumbled, and their smooth-tongued wizards withdrew,<br/>And the hearts of the meanest were humbled and began to believe it was true<br/>That All is not Gold that Glitters, and Two and Two make Four —<br/>And the Gods of the Copybook Headings limped up to explain it once more.</blockquote><blockquote>                                  *      *      *      *      *      *</blockquote><blockquote>As it will be in the future, it was at the birth of Man —<br/>There are only four things certain since Social Progress began: —<br/>That the Dog returns to his Vomit and the Sow returns to her mire,<br/>And the burnt Fool&#x27;s bandaged finger goes wabbling back to the Fire;<br/>And that after this is accomplished, and the brave new world begins<br/>When all men are paid for existing and no man must pay for his sins,<br/>As surely as Water will wet us, as surely as Fire will burn,<br/>The Gods of the Copybook Headings with terror and slaughter return! </blockquote><br/>",Davis_Kingsley,davis_kingsley,Davis_Kingsley,

<h2>Caveats</h2>
<ol>
<li>This does not decompose arguments exhaustively. It does not include every reason to favour or disfavour ideas. Rather, it is a set of key hypotheses and relationships with other hypotheses, problems, solutions, models, etc. Some examples of important but apparently uncontroversial premises within the AI safety community: <a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Orthogonality_thesis"">orthogonality</a>, <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/GNnHHmm8EzePmKzPk/value-is-fragile"">complexity of value</a>, <a href=""https://arbital.com/p/goodharts_curse/"">Goodhart's Curse</a>, AI being deployed in a catastrophe-sensitive context.</li>
<li>This is not a comprehensive collection of key hypotheses across the whole space of AI alignment. It focuses on a subspace that we find interesting and is relevant to more recent discussions we have encountered, but where key hypotheses seem relatively less illuminated. This includes rational agency and goal-directedness, CAIS, corrigibility, and the rationale of foundational and practical research. In hindsight, the selection criteria was something like:
<ol>
<li>The idea is closely connected to the problem of artificial systems optimizing adversarially against humans.</li>
<li>The idea must be explained sufficiently well that we believe it is plausible.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Arrows in the diagram indicate flows of evidence or soft relations, not absolute logical implications — please read the ""interpretation"" box in the diagram. Also pay attention to any reasoning written next to a Yes/No/Defer arrow — you may disagree with it, so don't blindly follow the arrow!</li>
</ol>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Much has been written in the way of arguments for AI risk. Recently there have been some <a href=""https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/9sBAW3qKppnoG3QPq/ben-garfinkel-how-sure-are-we-about-this-ai-stuff"">talks</a> <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/JbcWQCxKWn3y49bNB/disentangling-arguments-for-the-importance-of-ai-safety"">and</a> <a href=""https://fragile-credences.github.io/prioritising-ai/"">posts</a> that clarify different arguments, point to open questions, and highlight the need for further clarification and analysis. We largely share their assessments and echo their recommendations.</p>
<p>One aspect of the discourse that seems to be lacking clarification and analysis is the reasons to favour one argument over another — in particular, the key hypotheses or cruxes that underlie the different arguments. Understanding this better will make discourse more productive and help people reason about their beliefs.</p>
<p>This work aims to collate and clarify hypotheses that seem key to AI alignment in particular (by ""alignment"" we mean the problem of getting an AI system to reliably do what an overseer intends, or <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/EmDuGeRw749sD3GKd/p/ZeE7EKHTFMBs8eMxn"">try</a> to do so, depending on which part of the diagram you are in). We point to which hypotheses, arguments, approaches, and scenarios are favoured and disfavoured by each other. It is neither comprehensive nor sufficiently nuanced to capture everyone's views, but we expect it to reduce confusion and encourage further analysis.</p>
<p>You can digest this post through the diagram or the supplementary information, which have their respective strengths and limitations. However, <strong>we recommend starting with the <a href=""https://drive.google.com/open?id=1wI21XP-lRa6mi5h0dq_USooz0LpysdhS"">diagram</a></strong>, then if you are interested in related reading or our comments about a particular hypothesis, you can click the link on the box title in the diagram, or look it up below.</p>
<h2>Supplementary information</h2>
<p>The sections here list the hypotheses in the diagram, along with related readings and our more opinion-based comments, for lack of software to neatly embed this information (however, boxes in the diagram do link back to the headings here). Note that the diagram is the best way to understand relationships and high-level meaning, while this offers more depth and resources for each hypothesis. Phrases in italics with the first letter capitalised are referring to a box in the diagram.</p>
<h3>Definitions</h3>
<ul>
<li>AGI: a system (not necessarily agentive) that, for almost all economically relevant cognitive tasks, <em>at least</em> matches any human's ability at the task. Here, ""agentive AGI"" is essentially what people in the AI safety community usually mean when they say AGI. References to before and after AGI are to be interpreted as fuzzy, since this definition is fuzzy.</li>

<li>Comment: This is consistent with some of classical AI theory, and agency continues to be a relevant concept in capability-focused research, e.g. reinforcement learning. However, it has been argued that the way AI systems are taking shape today, and the way humans historically do engineering, are cause to believe superintelligent capabilities will be achieved by different means. Some grant that a CAIS-like scenario is probable, but maintain that there will still be <em>Incentive for agentive AGI</em>. Others argue that the current understanding of agency is problematic (perhaps just for being vague, or specifically in relation to <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/Rm6oQRJJmhGCcLvxh"">embeddedness</a>), so we should defer on this hypothesis until we better understand what we are talking about. It appears that this is a strong crux for the problem of <em>Incorrigible goal-directed superintelligence</em> and the general aim of <em>(Near) proof-level assurance of alignment</em>, versus <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/4dHMdK5TLN6xcqtyc/p/tHxXdAn8Yuiy9y2pZ"">other</a> approaches that reject alignment being such a hard, one-false-move kind of problem. However, to advance this debate it does seem important to clarify notions of goal-directedness and agency.</li>

<h3>Incentive for agentive AGI?</h3>
<p>Are there features of systems built like unitary goal-directed agents that offer a worthwhile advantage over other broadly superintelligent systems?</p>

<li>Comment: Some basic points argued in favour are that agentive AGI is significantly more efficient, or humans find agents easier to think about, or humans just want to build human-like agents for its own sake. However, even if agentive AGI offers greater efficiency, one could argue it is too risky or difficult to build, so we are better off settling for something like <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/HvNAmkXPTSoA4dvzv/comments-on-cais"">CAIS</a>.</li>

<h3>Modularity over integration?</h3>
<p>In general and holding resources constant, is a collection of modular AI systems with distinct interfaces more competent than a single integrated AI system?</p>
<ul>

<li>Comment: an almost equivalent trade-off here is generality vs. specialisation. Modular systems would benefit from specialisation, but likely bear greater cost in principal-agent problems and sharing information (see this <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/Sn5NiiD5WBi4dLzaB/agi-will-drastically-increase-economies-of-scale#xHjawPqwetPPbFu3y"">comment thread</a>). One case that might be relevant to think about is human roles in the economy — although humans have a general learning capacity, they have tended towards specialising their competencies as part of the economy, with almost no one being truly self-sufficient. However, this may be explained merely by limited brain size. The recent success of end-to-end learning systems has been <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/x3fNwSe5aWZb5yXEG/reframing-superintelligence-comprehensive-ai-services-as"">argued</a> in favour of integration, <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/HvNAmkXPTSoA4dvzv/comments-on-cais"">as has</a> the evolutionary precedent of humans (since human minds appear to be more integrated than modular).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Current AI R&amp;D extrapolates to AI services?</h3>
<p>AI systems so far generally lack some key qualities that are traditionally supposed of AGI, namely: pursuing cross-domain long-term goals, having broad capabilities, and being persistent and unitary. Does this lacking extrapolate, with increasing automation of AI R&amp;D and the rise of a broad collection of superintelligent services?</p>

<h3>Incidental agentive AGI?</h3>
<p>Will systems built like unitary goal-directed agents develop incidentally from something humans or other AI systems build?</p>

<h3>Convergent rationality?</h3>
<p>Given sufficient capacity, does an AI system converge on rational agency and consequentialism to achieve its objective?</p>
<ul>
<li>Related reading: <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/pLZ3bdeng4u5W8Yft/let-s-talk-about-convergent-rationality-1"">Let's talk about ""Convergent Rationality""</a></li>
<li>Comment: As far as we know, ""convergent rationality"" has only been named recently by David Krueger, and while it is not well fleshed out yet, it seems to point at an important and commonly-held assumption. There is some <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/pLZ3bdeng4u5W8Yft/let-s-talk-about-convergent-rationality-1#zPXWcpkeyw3p45TCy"">confusion</a> about whether the convergence could be a theoretical property, or is merely a matter of human framing, or merely a matter of <em>Incentive for agentive AGI</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Mesa-optimisation?</h3>
<p>Will there be optimisation processes that, in turn, develop considerably powerful optimisers to achieve their objective? A historical example is natural selection optimising for reproductive fitness to make humans. Humans may have good reproductive fitness, but optimise for other things such as pleasure even when this diverges from fitness.</p>

</ul>
<h3>Discontinuity to AGI?</h3>
<p>Will there be discontinuous, explosive growth in AI capabilities to reach the first agentive AGI? A discontinuity reduces the opportunity to correct course. Before AGI it seems most likely to result from a qualitative change in learning curve, due to an algorithmic insight, architectural change or scale-up in resource utilisation.</p>

<li>Comment: Discontinuity or fast takeoff is a central assumption of early arguments for AI risk and seems to have the greatest quantity of debate. A large proportion of the community supports it in some form, but this proportion has apparently decreased significantly in the last few years (beliefs changing or new people, it's unclear), with <a href=""https://sideways-view.com/2018/02/24/takeoff-speeds/"">Paul Christiano</a>'s and <a href=""https://aiimpacts.org/likelihood-of-discontinuous-progress-around-the-development-of-agi/"">Katja Grace</a>'s writing being a key influence. Note that we distinguish <em>to</em> AGI and <em>from</em> AGI because of strategic and developmental considerations around human-level. In published works the distinction has not been very clear — we would like to see more discussion about it. Thanks to Ben Garfinkel for pointing out how the distinction can be important.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Recursive self improvement?</h3>
<p>Is an AI system that improves through its own AI R&amp;D and self-modification capabilities more likely than distributed AI R&amp;D automation? Recursive improvement would give some form of explosive growth, and so could result in unprecedented gains in intelligence.</p>

<h3>Discontinuity from AGI?</h3>
<p>Will there be discontinuous, explosive growth in AI capabilities after agentive AGI? A discontinuity reduces the opportunity to correct course. After AGI it seems most likely to result from a recursive improvement capability.</p>

<h3>ML scales to AGI?</h3>
<p>Do contemporary machine learning techniques scale to general human level (and beyond)? The state-of-the-art experimental research aiming towards AGI is characterised by a set of theoretical assumptions, such as reinforcement learning and probabilistic inference. Does this paradigm readily scale to general human-level capabilities without fundamental changes in the assumptions or methods?</p>

<li>Comment: One might wonder how much change in assumptions or methods constitutes a paradigm shift, but the more important question is how relevant current ML safety work can be to the most high-stakes problems, and that seems to depend strongly on this hypothesis. Proponents of the ML safety approach admit that much of the work could turn out to be irrelevant, especially with a paradigm shift, but argue that there is nonetheless a worthwhile chance. ML is a fairly broad field, so people taking this approach should think more specifically about what aspects are relevant and scalable. If one proposes to build safe AGI by scaling up contemporary ML techniques, clearly they should believe the hypothesis — but there is also a feedback loop: the more feasible approaches one comes up with, the more evidence there is for the hypothesis. You may opt for <em>Foundational or ""deconfusion"" research</em> if (1) you don't feel confident enough about this to commit to working on ML, or (2) you think that, whether or not ML scales in terms of <em>capability</em>, we need deep insights about intelligence to get a satisfactory solution to <em>alignment</em>. This implies <em>Alignment is much harder than, or does not overlap much with, capability gain</em>.</li>

<h3>Deep insights needed?</h3>

<h3>Broad basin for corrigibility?</h3>
<p>Do <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/fkLYhTQteAu5SinAc/corrigibility"">corrigible</a> AI systems have a broad basin of attraction to <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/EmDuGeRw749sD3GKd/p/ZeE7EKHTFMBs8eMxn"">intent alignment</a>? Corrigible AI <em>tries</em> to help an overseer. It acts to improve its model of the overseer's preferences, and is incentivised to make sure any subsystems it creates are aligned — perhaps even more so than itself. In this way, perturbations or errors in alignment tend to be corrected, and it takes a large perturbation to move out of this ""basin"" of corrigibility.</p>
<ul>
<li>Related reading: <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/fkLYhTQteAu5SinAc/corrigibility"">Corrigibility</a>, <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/TR3eqQ2fnfKWzxxHL/research-agenda-in-reverse-what-would-a-solution-look-like#vyTWaiHxDhJQMzwib"">discussion on the need for a grounded definition of preferences (comment thread)</a>, <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/HTgakSs6JpnogD6c2/two-neglected-problems-in-human-ai-safety#1__How_to_prevent__aligned__AIs_from_unintentionally_corrupting_human_values_"">Two Neglected Problems in Human-AI Safety (problem 1 poses a challenge for corrigibility)</a></li>
<li>Comment: this definition of corrigibility is still vague, and although it can be explained to work in a desirable way, it is not clear how practically feasible it is. It seems that proponents of corrigible AI accept that greater theoretical understanding and clarification is needed: how <em>much</em> is a key source of disagreement. On a practical extreme, one would iterate experiments with tight feedback loops to figure it out, and correct errors on the go. This assumes ample opportunity for trial and error, rejecting <em>Discontinuity to/from AGI</em>. On a theoretical extreme, some <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/TR3eqQ2fnfKWzxxHL/research-agenda-in-reverse-what-would-a-solution-look-like#vyTWaiHxDhJQMzwib"">argue</a> that one would need to develop a new mathematical theory of preferences to be confident enough that this approach will work, or such a theory would provide the necessary insights to make it work at all. If you find this hypothesis weak, you probably put more weight on threat models based on <a href=""https://arbital.com/p/goodharts_curse/"">Goodhart's Curse</a>, e.g. <em>Incorrigible goal-directed superintelligence</em>, and the general aim of <em>(Near) proof-level assurance of alignment</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Inconspicuous failure?</h3>
<p>Will a concrete, catastrophic AI failure be overwhelmingly hard to recognise or anticipate? For certain kinds of advanced AI systems (namely the goal-directed type), it seems that short of near proof-level assurances, all safeguards are thwarted by the <a href=""https://arbital.com/p/nearest_unblocked/"">nearest unblocked strategy</a>. Such AI may also be incentivised for deception and manipulation towards a <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/B39GNTsN3HocW8KFo/superintelligence-11-the-treacherous-turn"">treacherous turn</a>. Or, in a machine learning framing, it would be very difficult to make such AI robust to distributional shift.</p>

<li>Comment: This seems to be a key part of many people's models for AI risk, which we associate most with MIRI. We think it significantly depends on whether there is <em>Agentive AGI</em>, and it supports the general aim of <em>(Near) proof-level assurance of alignment</em>. If we can get <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/4dHMdK5TLN6xcqtyc/p/tHxXdAn8Yuiy9y2pZ"">away</a> from that kind of AI, it is more likely that we can relax our approach and <em>Use feedback loops to correct course as we go</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Creeping failure?</h3>
<p>Would gradual gains in the influence of AI allow small problems to accumulate to catastrophe? The gradual aspect affords opportunity to recognise failures and think about solutions. Yet for any given incremental change in the use of AI, the economic incentives could outweigh the problems, such that we become more entangled in, and reliant on, a complex system that can collapse suddenly or drift from our values.</p>

This means that every point is mapped to some other point on the graph. For instance, (2,5) could be mapped to (1,3). Crucially, make sure this transformation doesn't cause any sort of sharp discontinuity: we don't want the graph to rip. I am not good with illustrating that type of thing, so I encourage you to imagine it instead in your head, or alternatively watch <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bohL918kXQk"">this video</a>. </p><p>There is a special set of such mappings, which we call <em>linear transformations</em>. Linear transformations have the property that when we perform the stretching, the gridlines are kept straight. We could still rotate the graph, for instance. But what we can't do is bend some axis so that it takes on a curvy shape after the transformation. If we drew a line on the graph before the linear transformation, it must remain a straight line after the transformation.</p><p>What does this have to do with the Jacobian?

However, the exact function that is being implemented depends crucially on the parameters, here denoted by the connections between the nodes. If we compute the Jacobian of this neural network with respect to the input, at some input instance, we would end up getting a good idea of how the neural network changes within the neighborhood of that particular input.</p><p>One way we can gain insight from a Jacobian is by computing its <em>determinant</em>. Recall, a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant"">determinant </a>is a function from square matrices to scalars which is defined recursively as the alternating sum and subtraction of determinants of the minors of the matrix multiplied by elements in the top row. On second thought, <em>don't</em> recall that definition of determinant; that's not going to get you anywhere. Despite the determinant's opaque definition, we can gain deeper insight into what the determinant represents by instead viewing it geometrically. In a few words, the determinant computes the scaling factor for a given linear transformation of a matrix. </p><span><figure><img src=""https://i.imgur.com/LY2CUSx.png"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:40%""></figure></span><p>Above, I have pulled from Wikimedia a parallelepiped, which was formed from some linear mapping of a cube. The volume of this parallelepiped is some multiple of the volume of the cube before the transformation. It turns out that no matter which region of space we look at, this linear transformation will generate the <em>same</em> ratio from post-transformed regions to pre-transformed regions. This ratio is given by the determinant of the matrix representing the linear mapping. In other words, the determinant tells us how much some transformation is expanding or contracting space.</p><p>What this means is for the Jacobian is that the determinant tells us how much space is being squished or expanded in the <em>neighborhood </em>around a point. If the output space is being expanded a lot at some input point, then this means that the neural network is a bit unstable at that region, since minor alterations in the input could cause huge distortions in the output. By contrast, if the determinant is small, then some small change to the input will hardly make a difference to the output. </p><p>This very fact about the Jacobian is behind a recent development in the regularization of deep neural networks. The idea is that we could use this interpretation of the Jacobian as a measure of robustness to input-perturbations around a point to make neural networks more robust off their training distribution. Traditional approaches like <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""L^2""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">L</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sup"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: 0.513em; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mn"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">2</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> regularization have emphasized the idea of keeping some parameters of the neural network from wandering off into extreme regions. The idea here is that smaller parameters are more likely <em>a priori</em>, which motivates the construction of some type of penalty on parameters that are too large. </p><p>In contrast to <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""L^2""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">L</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sup"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: 0.513em; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mn"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">2</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> regularization, the conceptual framing of Jacobian regularization comes from a different place. Instead of holding a leash on some parameters, to keep them from wandering off into the abyss, Jacobian regularization emphasizes providing robustness to small changes in the input space. The motivation behind this approach is clear to anyone who has been paying attention to adversarial examples over the last few years. To explain, adversarial examples are cases where we provide instances of a neural network where it performs very poorly, even if it had initially done well on a non-adversarial test set. Consider this example, <a href=""https://openai.com/blog/adversarial-example-research/"">provided </a>by OpenAI.</p><span><figure><img src=""https://openai.com/content/images/2017/02/adversarial_img_1.png"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:40%""></figure></span><p>The first image was correctly identified as a panda by the neural network. However, when we added a tiny bit of noise to the image, the neural network spit out garbage, confidently classifying a nearly exact copy as a gibbon. One could imagine a hypothetical adversary using this exploit to defeat neural network systems in practice. In the context of AI safety, adversarial attacks constitutes a potentially important subproblem of system reliability. </p><p>In Jacobian regularization, we approach this issue by putting a penalty on the size of the entries in the Jacobian matrix. The idea is simple: the smaller the values of the matrix, the less that tiny perturbations in input-space will affect the output. Concretely, the regularizer is described by taking the <a href=""http://mathworld.wolfram.com/FrobeniusNorm.html"">frobenius norm</a> of the Jacobian matrix, <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""||J(\mathbf{x})||_F^2""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-texatom""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">|</span></span></span></span><span class=""mjx-texatom""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">|</span></span></span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.078em;"">J</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">(</span></span><span class=""mjx-texatom""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-B"" style=""padding-top: 0.151em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">x</span></span></span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">)</span></span><span class=""mjx-texatom""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">|</span></span></span></span><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-texatom""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">|</span></span></span></span></span><span class=""mjx-stack"" style=""vertical-align: -0.309em;""><span class=""mjx-sup"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; padding-bottom: 0.417em; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mn"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">2</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mi"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.106em;"">F</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>. The frobenius norm is nothing complicated, and is really just a way of describing that we square all of the elements in the matrix, take the sum, and then take the square root of this sum.

Why? Because when we take the Jacobian of a purely <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_transformation"">affine function</a>, we obtain the global information about how the function stretches and rotates space, excluding the translation offset. This global information precisely composes the parameters that we would be penalizing. It is theoretically similar to how if we take the derivative of a line, we can reconstruct the line from the derivative and a bias term.</p><p>If while reading the last few paragraphs, you starting thinking <em>how is this just now being discovered?</em> you share my thoughts exactly. As far as I can tell, the seeds of Jacobian regularization have existed since at least the 1990s. However, it took until 2016 for a team to <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08254"">create a full implementation</a>. Only recently, as I write this in August 2019, has a team of researchers <a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.02729.pdf"">claimed to</a> have discovered an efficient algorithm for applying this regularization penalty to neural networks. </p><p>The way that researchers created this new method is by using <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_projection"">random projections</a> to approximate the Frobenius norm. Whereas the prior approach <em>mentioned </em>random projections, it was never put into practice. The new paper succeeded by devising an algorithm to approximate Jacobians efficiently with minimal overhead cost. </p><p>How efficiently? The paper states that there is</p><blockquote>only a negligible difference in model solution quality between training with the exact computation of the Jacobian as compared to training with the approximate algorithm, even when using a single random projection.</blockquote><p>If this technique really works as its described, this is a significant result. The paper claims that by applying Jacobian regularization, training uses only 30 percent more computation compared to traditional stochastic gradient descent without regularization at all. And for all that, we get some nice benefits: the system was significantly more robust to a <a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.06083.pdf"">PGD attack</a>, and it was apparently much better than vanilla <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""L^2""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">L</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sup"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: 0.513em; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mn"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">2</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> regularization due to the distance between decision cells in the output space. </p><span><figure><img src=""https://i.imgur.com/kyJlhrn.png"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:40%""></figure></span><p>I recommend looking at <a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.02729.pdf"">the paper</a> for more details. </p>",matthew-barnett,matthew-barnett,Matthew Barnett,

<p>Over the past couple months there was some extended discussion including myself, Habryka, Ruby, Vaniver, Jim Babcock, Zvi, Ben Hoffman, Jessicata and Zack Davis. The discussion has covered many topics, including <em>""what is reasonable to call 'lying'""</em>, and <em>""what are the best ways to discuss and/or deal with deceptive patterns in public discourse""</em>, <em>""what norms and/or principles should LessWrong aspire to""</em> and others.</p>
<p>This included comments on LessWrong, email, google-docs and in-person communication. This post is intended as an easier-to-read collection of what seemed (to me) like key points, as well as including my current takeaways.</p>
<p>Part of the challenge here was that it seemed like Benquo and I had <em>mostly</em> similar models, but many critiques I made seemed to Ben to be in the wrong abstraction, and vice-versa. Sometimes I would notice particular differences like ""In my model, it's important that accusations be held to a high standard"", whereas Ben felt ""it's important that criticism not be held to higher standards than praise."" But knowing this didn't seem to help much.</p>
<p>This post mostly summarizes existing online conversation. I'm hoping to do a followup where I make good on my promise to think more seriously through my cruxes-on-ontology, but it's slow going.</p>
<h1>Comment Highlights</h1>
<p>This begins with some comment highlights from LessWrong which seemed useful to gather in one place, followed by my takeaways after the fact.</p>
<h2>I attempt to pass Ben's ITT</h2>
<p>In the comments of <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/QB9eXzzQWBhq9YuB8/rationalizing-and-sitting-bolt-upright-in-alarm"">""Rationalization"" and ""Sitting Bolt Upright in Alarm""</a>, a few things eventually clicked and I attempted to pass Ben's Ideological Turing Test:</p>
<p>Let me know how this sounds as an <a href=""https://www.econlib.org/archives/2011/06/the_ideological.html"">ITT</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Thinking and building a life for yourself</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Much of civilization (and the rationalsphere as a subset of it and/or memeplex that's influenced and constrained by it) is generally pointed in the wrong direction. This has many facets, many of which reinforce each other. Society tends to:</li>
<li>Schools systematically teach people to associate reason with listening-to/pleasing-teachers, or moving-words-around unconnected from reality. [<a href=""http://benjaminrosshoffman.com/the-order-of-the-soul/"">Order of the Soul]</a></li>
<li>Society systematically pushing people to live apart from each other, to work until they need (or believe they need) palliatives, in a way that doesn't give you space to think <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/p7hW7E3fHF3PDzErk/sabbath-hard-and-go-home#aGLYEajPuHq5GaSPq"">[Sabbath Hard and Go Home]</a></li>
<li>Relatedly, society provides structure that incentivizes you to advance in arbitrary hierarchy, or to tread water and barely stay afloat, without reflection of what you actually want.</li>
<li>By contrast, for much of history, there was a much more direct connection between what you did, how you thought, and how your own life was bettered. If you wanted a nicer home, you built a nicer home. This came with many overlapping incentive structures reinforced something closer to living healthily and generating real value.</li>
<li>(I'm guessing a significant confusion was me seeing this whole section as only moderately connected rather than central to the other sections)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>We desperately need clarity</em></p>
<ul>
<li>There's a collection of pressures, in many-but-not-all situations, to keep both facts and decision-making principles obfuscated, and to warp language in a way that enables that. This is often part of an overall strategy (sometimes conscious, sometimes unconscious) to maneuver groups for personal gain.</li>
<li>It's important to be able to speak plainly about forces that obfuscate. It's important to lean _fully_into clarity and plainspeak, not just taking marginal steps towards it, both because clear language is very powerful intrinsically, and there's a sharp dropoff as soon as ambiguity leaks in (moving the conversation to higher simulacrum levels, at which point it's very hard to recover clarity)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>[Least confident] The best focus is on your own development, rather than optimizing systems or other people</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Here I become a lot less confident. This is my attempt to summarize whatever's going on in our disagreement about my ""<a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4ZvJab25tDebB8FGE/you-have-about-five-words"">When coordinating at scale, communicating has to reduce gracefully to about 5 words</a>"" thing. I had an impression that this seemed deeply wrong, confusing, or threatening to you. I still don't really understand why. But my best guesses include:</li>
<li>This is putting the locus of control in the group, at a moment-in-history where the most important thing is reasserting individual agency and thinking for yourself (because many groups are doing the wrong-things listed above)</li>
<li>Insofar as group coordination is a lens to be looked through, it's important that groups a working in a way that respects everyone's agency and ability to think (to avoid falling into some of the failure modes associated with the first bullet point), and simplifying your message so that others can hear/act on it is part of an overall strategy that is causing harm</li>
<li>Possibly a simpler ""people can and should read a lot and engage with more nuanced models, and most of the reason you might think that they can't is because school and hierarchical companies warped your thinking about that?""
And then, in light of all that, something is off with my mood when I'm engaging with individual pieces of that, because I'm not properly oriented around the other pieces?
Does that sound right? Are there important things left out or gotten wrong?</li>
</ul>

<p>Ben responded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This sounds really, really close. Thanks for putting in the work to produce this summary!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I think my objection to the 5 Words post fits a pattern where I've had difficulty expressing a class of objection. The literal content of the post wasn't the main problem. The main problem was the emphasis of the post, in conjunction with your other beliefs and behavior.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It seemed like the hidden second half of the core claim was ""and therefore we should coordinate around simpler slogans,"" and not the obvious alternative conclusion ""and therefore we should scale up more carefully, with an uncompromising emphasis on some aspects of quality control."" (See O<a href=""http://benjaminrosshoffman.com/construction-beacons/"">n the Construction of Beacons</a> for the relevant argument.)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It seemed to me like there was some motivated ambiguity on this point. The emphasis seemed to consistently recommend public behavior that was about mobilization rather than discourse, and back-channel discussions among well-connected people (including me) that felt like they were more about establishing compatibility than making intellectual progress. This, even though it seems like you explicitly agree with me that our current social coordination mechanisms are massively inadequate, in a way that (to me obviously) implies that they can't possibly solve FAI.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I felt like if I pointed this kind of thing out too explicitly, I'd just get scolded for being uncharitable. I didn't expect, however, that this scolding would be accompanied by an explanation of what specific, anticipation-constraining, alternative belief you held. I've been getting better at p_ointing out this pattern_ (e.g. my r<a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xhE4TriBSPywGuhqi/integrity-and-accountability-are-core-parts-of-rationality#JxRpX9xDqgDr4DZNe"">ecent response</a> to habryka) instead of just shutting down due to a preverbal recognition of it. It's very hard to write a comment like this one clearly and without extraneous material, especially of a point-scoring or whining nature. (If it were easy I'd see more people writing things like this.)</p>

<h2>Summary of Private LessWrong Thread (Me/Benquo/Jessica)</h2>
<p>One experiment we tried during the conversation was to hold a conversation on LessWrong, in a private draft (i.e. where we could respond to each other with nested threading, but only have to worry about responding to each other)</p>
<p>The thread was started by Ruby, with some proposals for LessWrong moderation style. At first the conversation was primarily Ruby and Zvi. At some point Ruby might make the full thread public, but for now I'm focusing on an exchange between Benquo, Jessica and I, which I found most helpful for clarifying our positions.</p>
<p><strong>Benquo:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>It might help for me to also try to make a positive statement of what I think is at stake here. [...]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What I see as under threat is the ability to say in a way that's actually heard, not only that opinion X is false, but that the process generating opinion X is untrustworthy, and perhaps actively optimizing in an objectionable direction. Frequently, attempts to say this are construed p_rimarily_ as moves to attack some person or institution, pushing them into the outgroup. Frequently, people suggest to me an ""equivalent"" wording with a softer tone, which in fact omits important substantive criticisms I mean to make, while claiming to understand what's at issue.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>I responded:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>My core claim is: ""right now, this isn't possible, without a) it being heard by many people as an attack, b) without people having to worry that other people will see it as an attack, even if they don't.""</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It seems like you see this something as ""<em>there's a precious thing that might be destroyed""</em> and I see it as ""<em>a precious thing does not exist and must be created, and the circumstances in which it can exist are fragile.""</em> It might have existed in the very early days of LessWrong. But the landscape now is very different than it was then. With billions of dollars available and at stake, what worked then can't be the same thing as what works now.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[in public. In private things are much easier. It's *also* the case that private channels enable collusion –&nbsp;that was an update i've made over the course of the conversation.]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And, while I believe that you earnestly believe that the quote paragraph is important, your individual statements often look too optimized-as-an-obfuscated-attack for me to trust that they are not. I assign substantial probability to a lot of your motives being basically traditional coalition-political and you are just in denial about it, with a complicated narrative to support them. If that's not true, I realize it must be extremely infuriating to be treated that way. But the nature of the social landscape makes it a bad policy for me to take you at your word in many of the cases.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Wishing the game didn't exist doesn't make the game not exist. We could all agree to stop playing at once, but a) we'd need to credibly believe we were all actually going to stop playing at once, b) have enforcement mechanisms to make sure it continues not being played, c) have a way to ensure newcomers are also not playing.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And I think that's all possibly achievable, incrementally. I think ""how to achieve that"" is a super important question. But attempting to not-play the game without putting in that effort looks me basically like putting a sign that says ""cold"" on a broken refrigerator and expecting your food to stay fresh.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>...</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I spent a few minutes trying to generate cruxes. Getting to ""real"" cruxes here feels fairly hard and will probably take me a couple hours. (I think this conversation is close to the point where I'd really prefer us to each switch to the role of ""Pass each other's ITTs, and figure out what would make ourselves change our mind"" rather than ""figure out how to explain why we're right."" This may require more model-sharing and trust-building first, dunno)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But I think the closest proximate crux is: I would trust Ben's world-model a lot more if I saw a lot more discussion of how the game theory plays out over multiple steps. I'm not <em>that</em> confident that my interpretation of the game theory and social landscape are right. But I can't recall any explorations of it, and I think it should be at least 50% of the discussion here.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But the landscape now is very different than it was then. With billions of dollars available and at stake, what worked then can’t be the same thing as what works now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Jessica responds to me:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is this a claim that people are almost certainly going to be protecting their reputations (and also beliefs related to their reputations) in anti-epistemic ways when large amounts of money are at stake, in a way they wouldn't if they were just members of a philosophy club who didn't think much money was at stake?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This claim seems true to me. We might actually have a lot of agreement. And this matches my impression of ""EA/rationality shift from 'that which can be destroyed by the truth should be' norms towards 'protect feelings' norms as they have grown and want to play nicely with power players while maintaining their own power.""</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If we agree on this point, the remaining disagreement is likely about the game theory of breaking the bad equilibrium as a small group, as you're saying it is.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(Also, thanks for bringing up money/power considerations where they're relevant; this makes the discussion much less obfuscated and much more likely to reach cruxes)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[Note, my impression is that the precious thing already exists among a small number of people, who are trying to maintain and grow the precious thing and are running into opposition, and enough such opposition can cause the precious thing to go away, and the precious thing is currently being maintained largely through willingness to forcefully push through opposition. Note also, if the precious thing used to exist (among people with strong stated willingness to maintain it) and now doesn't, that indicates that forces against this precious thing are strong, and have to be opposed to maintain the precious thing.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>I responded:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>An important thing I said earlier in another thread was that I saw roughly two choices for how to do the precious thing, which is something like:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you want to do the precious thing in public (in particular when billions of dollars are at stake, although also when narrative and community buy-in are at stake), it requires a lot of special effort, and is costly</li>
<li>You can totally do the precious thing in small private, and it's much easier</li>
<li>And I think a big chunk of the disagreement comes from the 'small private groups are <em>also</em> a way that powerful groups collude, and be duplicitous, and other things in that space.'</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[There's a separate issue, which is that researchers might feel more productive, locally, in private. But failure to write up their ideas publicly means other people can't build on them, which is globally worse. So you also want some pressure on research groups to publish more]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So the problem-framing as I currently see it is:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>What are the least costly ways you can have plainspoken truth in public, without destroying (or resulting in someone else destroying) the shared public space. Or, what collection of public truthseeking norms output the most useful true things per unit of effort in a sustainable fashion</li>
<li>What are ways that we can capture the benefits of private spaces (sometimes recruiting new people into the private spaces), while having systems/norms/counterfactual-threats in place to prevent collusion and duplicity, and encourage more frequent publishing of research.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And the overall strategy I currently expect to work best (but with weak confidence, haven't thought it through) is:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Change the default of private conversations from 'stay private forever' to 'by default, start in private, but with an assumption that the conversation will usually go public unless there's a good reason not to, with participants having veto* power if they think it's important not to go public.""</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>An alternate take on ""the conversation goes public"" is ""the participants write up a distillation of the conversation that's more optimized for people to learn what happened, which both participants endorse."" (i.e. while I'm fine with all my words in this private thread being shared, I think trying to read the entire conversation might be more confusing than it needs to be. It might not be worth anyone's time to write up a distillation, but if someone felt like it I think that'd be preferable all else being equal)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Have this formally counterbalanced by ""if people seem to be abusing their veto power for collusion or duplicitous purposes, have counterfactual threats to publicly harm each other's reputation (possibly betraying the veto-process*), which hopefully doesn't happen, but the threat of it happening keeps people honest.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>*Importantly, a formal part of the veto system is that if people get angry enough, or decide it's important enough, they can just ignore your veto. If the game is rigged, the correct thing to do is kick over the gameboard. But, everyone has a shared understanding that a gameboard is better than no gameboard, so instead, people are incentivized to not rig the game (or, if the game is currently rigged, work together to de-rig it)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Because everyone agrees that these are the rules of the metagame, betraying the confidence of the private space is seen as a valid action (i.e. if people didn't agree that these were the meta-rules, I'd consider betraying someone's confidence to be a deeply bad sign about a person's trustworthiness. But if people d_oa_gree to the meta-rules, then if someone betrays a veto it's a sign that you should maybe be hesitant to collaborate with that person, but not as strong a sign about their overall trustworthiness)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Jessica:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm first going to summarize what I think you think:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>$Billions are at stake.</li>
<li>People/organizations are giving public narratives about what they're doing, including ones that affect the $billions.</li>
<li>People/organizations also have narratives that function for maintaining a well-functioning, cohesive community.</li>
<li>People criticize these narratives sometimes. These criticisms have consequences.</li>
<li>Consequences include: People feel the need to defend themselves. People might lose funding for themselves or their organization. People might fall out of some ""ingroup"" that is having the important discussions. People might form coalitions that tear apart the community. The overall trust level in the community, including willingness to take the sensible actions that would be implied by the community narrative, goes down.</li>
<li>That doesn't mean criticism of such narratives is always bad. Sometimes, it can be done well.</li>
<li>Criticisms are important to make if the criticism is really clear and important (e.g. the criticism of ACE). Then, people can take appropriate action, and it's clear what to do. (See <a href=""http://www.overcomingbias.com/2017/02/when-do-opinions-converge.html"">strong and clear evidence</a>)</li>
<li>Criticisms are potentially destructive when they don't settle the matter. These can end up reducing cohesion/trust, splitting the community, tarnishing reputations of people who didn't actually do something wrong, etc.</li>
<li>These non-matter-settling criticisms can still be important to make. But, they should be done with sensitivity to the political dynamics involved.</li>
<li>People making public criticisms willy-nilly would lead to a bunch of bad effects (already mentioned). There are standards for what makes a good criticism, where ""it's true/well-argued"" is not the only standard. (Other standards are: is it clear, is it empathetic, did the critic try other channels first, etc)</li>
<li>It's still important to get to the truth, including truths about adversarial patterns. We should be doing this by thinking about what norms get at these truths with minimum harm caused along the way.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Here's a summary of what I think (written before I summarized what you thought):</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The fact that $billions are at stake makes reaching the truth in public discussions strictly more important than for a philosophy club. (After all, these public discussions are affecting the background facts that private discussions, including ones that distribute large amounts of money, assume)</li>
<li>The fact that $billions are at stake increases the likelihood of obfuscatory action compared to in a philosophy club.</li>
<li>The ""level one"" thing to do is to keep using philosophy club norms, like old-LessWrong. Give reasons for thinking what you think. Don't make appeals to consequences or shut people up for saying inconvenient things; argue at the object level. Don't insult people. If you're too sensitive to hear the truth, that's for the most part your problem, with some exceptions (e.g. some personal insults). Mostly don't argue about whether the other people are biased/adversarial, and instead make good object-level arguments (this could be stated somewhat misleadingly as ""assume good faith""). Have public debates, possibly with moderators.</li>
<li>A problem with ""level one"" norms is that they rarely talk about obfuscatory action. ""Assume good faith"", taken literally, implies obfuscation isn't happening, which is false given the circumstances (including monetary incentives). Philosophy club norms have some security flaws.</li>
<li>The ""level two"" thing to do is to extend philosophy club norms to handle discussion of adversarial action. Courts don't assume good faith; it would be transparently ridiculous to do so.</li>
<li>Courts blame and disproportionately punish people. We don't need to do this here, we need the truth to be revealed one way or another. Disproportionate punishments make people really defensive and obfuscatory, understandably. (Law fought fraud, and fraud won)</li>
<li>So, ""level two"" should develop language for talking about obfuscatory/destructive patterns of social action that doesn't disproportionately punish people just for getting caught up in them. (Note, there are some ""karmic"" consequences for getting caught up in these dynamics, like having the organization be less effective and getting a reputation for being bad at resisting social pressure, but these are very different from the disproportionate punishments typical of the legal system, which punish disproportionately on the assumption that most crime isn't caught)</li>
<li>I perceive a backslide from ""level one"" norms, towards more <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/m7v3vtbRv82mQP5uo/the-engineer-and-the-diplomat"">diplomatic norms</a>, where certain things are considered ""rude"" to say and are ""attacking people"", even if they'd be accepted in philosophy club. I think this is about maintaining power illegitimately.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Here are more points that I thought of after summarizing your position:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>I actually agree that individuals should be using their discernment about how and when to be making criticisms, given the political situation.</li>
<li>I worry that saying certain ways of making criticisms are good/bad results in people getting silenced/blamed even when they're saying true things, which is really bad.</li>
<li>So I'm tempted to argue that the norms for public discussion should be approximately ""that which can be destroyed by the truth should be"", with some level of privacy and politeness norms, the kind you'd have in a combination of a philosophy club and a court.</li>
<li>That said, there's still a complicated question of ""how do you make criticisms well"". I think advice on this is important. I think the correct advice usually looks more like advice to whistleblowers than advice for diplomacy.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Note, my opinion of your opinions, and my opinions, are expressed in pretty different ontologies. What are the cruxes?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Suppose future-me tells me that I'm pretty wrong, and actually I'm going about doing criticisms the wrong way, and advocating bad norms for criticism, relative to you. Here are the explanations I come up with:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>""Scissor statements"" are actually a huge risk. Make sure to prove the thing pretty definitively, or there will be a bunch of community splits that make discussion and cooperation harder. Yes, this means people are getting deceived in the meantime, and you can't stop that without causing worse bad consequences. Yes, this means group epistemology is really bad (resembling mob behavior), but you should try upgrading that a different way.</li>
<li>You're using language that implies court norms, but courts disproportionately punish people. This language is going to increase obfuscatory behavior way more than it's worth, and possibly result in disproportionate punishments. You should try really, really hard to develop different language. (Yes, this means some sacrifice in how clear things can be and how much momentum your reform movement can sustain)</li>
<li>People saying critical things about each other in public (including not-very-blamey things like ""I think there's a distortionary dynamic you're getting caught up in"") looks really bad in a way that deterministically makes powerful people, including just about everyone with money, stop listening to you or giving you money. Even if you get a true discourse going, the community's reputation will be tarnished by the justice process that led to that, in a way that locks the community out of power indefinitely. That's probably not worth it, you should try another approach that lets people save face.</li>
<li>Actually, you don't need to be doing public writing/criticism very much at all, people are perfectly willing to listen to you in private, you just have to use <em>this</em> strategy that you're not already using.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>These are all pretty cruxy; none of them seem likely (though they're all plausible), and if I were convinced of any of them, I'd change my other beliefs and my overall approach.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There are a lot of subtleties here. I'm up for having in-person conversations if you think that would help (recorded / written up or not).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Me final response in that thread:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is an awesome comment on many dimensions, thanks. I both agree with your summary of my position, and I think your cruxes are pretty similar to my cruxes.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There are a few additional considerations of mine which I'll list, followed by attempting to tease out some deeper cruxes of mine about ""what facts would have to be true for me to want to backpropagate the level of fear it seems like you feel into my aesthetic judgment."" [This is a particular metaframe I'm currently exploring]</p>
<p>[Edit: turned out to be more than a few straightforward assumptions, and I haven't gotten to the aesthetic or ontology cruxes yet]</p>
<p><strong>Additional considerations from my own beliefs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I define clarity in terms of what gets understood, rather than what gets said. So, using words with non-standard connotations, without doing a lot of up-front work to redefine your terms, seems to me to be reducing clarity, and/or mixing clarity, rather than improving it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think it's especially worthwhile to develop non-court language, for public discourse, if your intent is not to be punative – repurposing court language for non-punative action is particularly confusing. The first definition for ""fraud"" that comes up on google is ""wrongful or criminal deception intended to result in financial or personal gain"". The connotation I associate it with is ""the kind of lying you pay fines or go to jail for or get identified as a criminal for"".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By default, language-processing is a mixture of truthseeking and politicking. The more political a conversation feels, the harder it will be for people to remain in truthseeking mode. I see the primary goal of a rationalist/truthseeking space to be to ensure people remain in truthseeking mode. I don't think this is <em>completely</em> necessary but I do think it makes the space much more effective (in terms of time spent getting points across).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think it's very important for language re: how-to-do-politics-while-truthseeking be created <em>separately</em> from any live politics –&nbsp;otherwise, one of the first things that'll happen is the language get coopted and distorted by the political process. People are right/just to fear you developing political language if you appear to be actively trying to wield political weapons against people while you develop it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fact that is (quite plausibly) my true rejection</strong> –&nbsp;Highly tense conversations that I get defensive at are among the most stressful things I experience, which cripple my ability to sleep well while doing them. This is high enough cost that if I had to do it all the time, I would probably just tune them out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is a selfish perspective, and I should perhaps be quite suspicious of the rest of my arguments in light of it. But it's not obviously wrong to me in the first place – having stressful weeks of sleep wrecked is really bad. When I imagine a world where people are criticizing me all the time [in particular when they're misunderstanding my frame, see below about deep model differences], it's not at all obvious that the net benefit I or the community gets from people getting to express their criticism more easily outways the cost in productivity (which would, among other things, be spent on other truthseeking pursuits). When I imagine this multiplied across all orgs it's not very surprising or unreasonable seeming for people to have learned to tune out criticism.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Single Most Important Belief that I endorse</strong> – I think trying to develop a language for truthseeking-politics (or politics-adjaecent stuff) could potentially permanently destroy the ability for a given space do politics sanely. It's possible to do it right, but also very easy to fuck up, and instead of properly transmitting truthseeking-into-politics, politics backpropogates into truthseeking, causes people to view truthseeking norms as a political weapon. I think this is basically what happened with the American Right Wing and their view of science (and I think things like the March for Science are harmful because they exacerbate Science as Politics).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the same way that it's bad to tell a lie, to accomplish some locally good thing (because the damage you do to the ecosystem is far worse than whatever locally good thing you accomplished), I think it is bad to try to invent truthseeking-politics-on-the-fly without explaining well what you are doing while also making claims that people are (rightly) worried will cost them millions of dollars. Whatever local truth you're outputting is much less valuable than the risks you are playing with re: the public commons of ""ability to ever discuss politics sanely.""</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I <em>really</em> wish we had developed good tools to discuss politics sanely before we got access to billions of dollars. That was an understandable mistake (I didn't think about it until just this second), but it probably cost us deeply. Given that we didn't, I think creating good norms requires much more costly signaling of good faith (on everyone's part) than it might have needed. [this paragraph is all weak confidence since I just thought of it but feels pretty true to me]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People have deep models, in which certain things seem obvious them that are not obvious to others. I think I drastically disagree with you about what your prior should be that ""Bob has a non-motivated deep model (or, not any more motivated than average) that you don't understand"", rather than ""Bob's opinion or his model is different/frightening because he is motivated, deceptive and/or non-truth-tracking.""</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My impression is that everyone with a deep, weird model that I've encountered was overly biased in favor of their deep model (including you and Ben), but this seems sufficiently explained by ""when you focus all your attention on one particular facet of reality, that facet looms much larger in your thinking, and other facets loom less large"", with some amount of ""their personality or circumstance biased them towards their model"" (but, not to a degree that seems particularly weird or alarming).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seeing ""true reality"" involves learning lots of deep models into narrow domains and then letting them settle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[For context/frame, remember that it took Eliezer 2 years of blogging every day to get everyone up to speed on how to think in his frame. That's roughly the order-of-magnitude of effort that seems like you should expect to expend to explain a counterintuitive worldview to people]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In particular, a lot of the things that seem alarming to you (like, Givewell's use of numbers that seem wrong) is pretty well (but not completely) explained by ""it's actually very counterintuitive to have the opinions you do about what reasonable numbers are."" I have updated more towards your view on the matter, but a) it took me a couple years, b) it still doesn't seem very obvious to me. Drowning-Children-are-Rare is a plausible hypothesis but doesn't seem so overdetermined that anyone thinks otherwise must be deeply motivated or deceptive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I'm not saying this applies across the board. I can think of several people in EA or rationalist space who seem motivated in important ways. My sense of deep models specifically comes from the combination of ""the deep model is presented to me when I inquire about it, and makes sense"", and ""they have given enough costly signals of trustworthiness that I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt.""</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have updated over the past couple years on how bad ""PR management"" and diplomacy are for your ability to think, and I appreciate the cost a bit more, but it still seems less than the penalties you get for truthseeking when people feel unsafe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have (low confidence) models that seem fairly different from Ben (and I assume your) model of what exactly early LessWrong was like, and what happened to it. This is complicated and I think beyond scope for this comment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unknown Unknowns, and model-uncertainty. I'm not actually <em>that</em> worried about scissor-attacks, and I'm not sure how confident I am about many of the previous models. But they are all worrisome enough that I think caution is warranted.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>""Regular"" Cruxes</strong></p>
<p>Many of the above bullet-points are cruxy and suggest natural crux-reframes. I'm going to go into some detail for a few:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I could imagine learning that my priors on ""deep model divergence"" vs ""nope, they're just really deceptive"" are wrong. I don't actually have all that many data points to have longterm confidence here. It's just that so far, most of the smoking guns that have been presented to me didn't seem very definitive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The concrete observations that would shift this are ""at least one of the people that I have trusted turns out to have a smoking gun that makes me think their deep model was highly motivated"" [I will try to think privately about what concrete examples of this might be, to avoid a thing where I confabulate justifications in realtime.]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It might be a lot easier than I think to create a public truthseeking space that remains sane in the face of money and politics. Relatedly, I might be overly worried about the risk of destroying longterm ability to talk-about-politics-sanely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If I saw an existing community that operated on a public forum and onboarded new people all the time, which had the norms you are advocating, and interviewing various people involved seemed to suggest it was working sanely, I'd update. I'm not sure if there are easier bits of evidence to find.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The costs that come from diplomacy might be higher than the costs of defensiveness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Habryka has described experiences where diplomacy/PR-concerns seemed bad-for-his-soul in various ways. [not 100% sure this is quite the right characterization but seems about right]. I think so far I haven't really been ""playing on hard mode"" in this domain, and I think there's a decent chance that I will be over the next few years. I could imagine updating about how badly diplomacy cripples thought after having that experience, and for it to turn out to be greater than defensiveness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I might be the only person that suffers from sleep loss or other stress-side-effects as badly as I do.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These were the easier ones. I'm trying to think through the ""ontology doublecrux"" thing and think about what sorts of things would change my ontology. That may be another while.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Criticism != Accusation of Wrongdoing</h2>
<p>Later on, during an in-person conversation with Jessica, someone else (leaving them anonymous) pointed out an additional consideration, which is that criticism isn't the same as accusations.</p>
<p>[I'm not sure I fully understood the original version of this point, so the following is just me speaking for myself about things I believe]</p>
<p>There's an important social technology, which is to have norms that people roughly agree on. The costs of everyone having to figure out their own norms are enormous. So most communities have at least some basic things that you don't do (such as blatantly lying)</p>
<p>Several important properties here are:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can ostracize people who continuously violate norms.</li>
<li>If someone accuses you of a norm violation, you feel obligated to defend yourself. (Which is very different from getting criticized for something that's <em>not</em> a norm violation)</li>
<li>If Alice makes an accusation of someone violating norms, and that accusation turns out to be exaggerated or ill-founded, that Alice loses points, and people are less quick to believe her or give her a platform to speak next time.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think one aspect of the deep disagreements going on here is something like ""what exactly are the costs of everyone having to develop their own theory of goodness"", and/or what are the benefits of the ""there are norms, that get enforced and defended"" model.</p>
<p>I understand Benquo and Jessica are arguing that we do not in fact have such norms, we just have the illusion of such norms, and in fact what we have are weird political games that benefit the powerful. And they see their approach as helping to dispel that illusion.</p>
<p>Whereas I think we do in fact have those norms –&nbsp;there's a degree of lying that would get you expelled from the rationalsphere and EAsphere , and this is important. And so insisting on being able to discuss, in public, whether Bob lied [a norm violation], while claiming that this is not an attack on Bob, just an earnest discussion of the truth or model-building of adversarial discourse... is degrading not only the specific norm of ""don't lie"" but also ""our general ability to have norms.""</p>
<h2>My current state</h2>
<p>I'm currently in the process of mulling this all over. The high level questions are something like:</p>
<ul>
<li>[Within my current ontology] What sorts of actions by EA leaders would shift my position from ""right now we actually have a reasonably good foundation of trustworthiness"" to ""things are not okay, to the point where it makes more sense to kick the game board over rather than improve things."" Or, alternately ""things are not okay, and I need to revise my ontology in order to account for it.""</li>
<li>How exactly would/should I shift my ontology if things were sufficiently bad?</li>
</ul>
<p>I expect this to be a fairly lengthy process, and require a fair amount of background processing.</p>
<p>There are other things I'm considering here, and writing them up turned out to take more time than I have at the moment. Will hopefully have a Pt 2 of this post.</p>

The relevant psychiatric diagnosis is DID (formerly MPD, multiple personality disorder). In these cases the multiple agents often manifest very clearly and distinctly. It is tempting to write it off as a special case that does not apply in the mainstream, yet I have seen more than once the progression from someone suffering from CPTSD to a full-blown DID. The last thing that happens is that the person recognizes that they &quot;switch&quot; between personalities. Often way later than when others notice it, if they know what to look for. After gaining some experience chatting with those who survived severe prolonged trauma, I started recognizing subtler signs of &quot;switching&quot; in myself and others. This switching between agents (I would not call them sub-agents, as they are not necessarily less than the &quot;main&quot;, and different &quot;mains&quot; often take over during different parts of the person&#x27;s life) while a normal way to operate, as far as I can tell, almost never rises to the level of conscious awareness, as the brain carefully constructs the lie of single identity for as long as it can.</blockquote><p>-- <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/8ZrDp7d5t4fwKXfj3/tentatively-considering-emotional-stories-ifs-and-getting?commentId=dm8bPXXi6Fg8NJmw3"">shminux</a></u></p><p>As the above comment suggests, the appearance of something like distinct subagents is particularly noticeable in people with heavy trauma, DID being the most extreme example. </p><p>This post will interpret the appearance of subagents as emerging from <em>unintegrated memory networks</em>, and argue that - as shminux suggests - the presence of these is a matter of degree. There’s a continuous progression of fragmented (dissociated) memory networks giving arise to increasingly worse symptoms as the degree of fragmentation grows. The continuum goes from everyday procrastination and akrasia on the “normal” end, to disrupted and dysfunctional beliefs on the middle, and conditions like clinical PTSD, borderline personality disorder, and dissociative identity disorder on the severely traumatized end. </p><p>I will also argue that emotional work and exploring one&#x27;s past traumas in order to heal them, is necessary for effective instrumental and epistemic rationality. </p><p>This post is largely based on what I understand to be relatively standard trauma theory (e.g. van der Kolk, 2014; Shapiro, 2017; Baldwin, 2013; Schauer &amp; Elbert, 2010; Forgash &amp; Copeley, 2007) and should not contain any particularly novel or original claims, except maybe for drawing some connections to topics and framings which I have been discussing previously in my sequence.</p><h1>Emotional regulation as an approach-avoid tradeoff</h1><p>In <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5gfqG3Xcopscta3st/building-up-to-an-internal-family-systems-model"">Building up to an Internal Family Systems model</a></u>, I talked about “protector” subagents (subdivided into managers and firefighters), whose purpose was to keep negative emotions and memories (“exile” subagents) out of consciousness. If they predicted that entering some situation would trigger a negative memory, then they would try to prevent the person from going to that situation, because a situation triggering a negative memory correlates with such situations being dangerous. Thus, my explanation suggested that the only purpose of protectors was to keep a person out of concrete danger.</p><p>However, something like protectors is also a necessary component for emotional regulation. There are a number of difficult tradeoffs implied by the following facts:</p><ul><li>In detecting possible threats, it is usually better to err on the side of too many false positives. Mistaking a tree branch for a snake is less costly than mistaking a snake for a tree branch.</li><li>At the same time, false positives which trigger automatic fight-or-flight-or-freeze responses <em>do</em> also have a cost; once an alarm has been shown to be false, there need to be mechanisms for winding it down.</li><li>Sometimes a situation <em>is</em> dangerous and unpleasant and costly, <em>and</em> going into it is what you need to do anyway. There has to be a mechanism for overriding the alarms when it is necessary.</li><li>A special case of this is when trying to flee a dangerous situation is by itself dangerous. If you’re wounded and there’s an enemy nearby, you may have better odds trying to play dead than running away. You may also be someone’s slave with poor chances of escaping. For those cases, you need a mechanism specifically for shutting down the fight-or-flight response.</li><li>At the same time, an organism which had too easy of a time overriding its alarms would not take them sufficiently seriously, and would be killed or otherwise hurt by constantly going into dangerous situations and not trying to escape them.</li></ul><p>In humans as well as other mammals, brain areas controlling evolutionarily ancient defense state responses become active when danger is detected. While the “higher” cognitive functions of the frontal cortex are to some extent capable of regulating these emotional responses when they are mild, the emotional brain can and will override the frontal cortex in dangerous situations. In situations of sufficient distress, rational thinking and the ability to regulate emotional responses shut down entirely. </p><p>Furthermore, sensory inputs are constantly scanned by the amygdala for patterns which have been associated with danger in the past. The time it takes for the amygdala to process inputs is shorter than the time it takes for them to reach consciousness, and the amygdala may trigger an emotional response before higher cognitive systems even become aware of the situation.</p><p>Thus, if the emotional brain detects something it considers threatening enough, it <em>will</em> react, regardless of whether or not the cognitive brain considers it a good idea. If particular cues tend to co-occur with particularly serious danger states reliably enough, then the brain will build up an associative network where detecting any of those cues will automatically trigger threat responses, with no opportunity for cognitive overrides. This can become a serious problem for normal functioning, as any of the cues in the fear network may trigger an emergency response, even in completely harmless situations.</p><br/><span><figure><img src=""https://stuff.kajsotala.fi/LW/Trauma/TraumaNetwork.png"" class=""draft-image "" style=""width:100%"" /></figure></span><p><em>Example trauma network (Schauer &amp; Elbert 2010). </em></p><p>Many of the elements of the pictured trauma network - neighbors, motorbikes, the smell of alcohol - are ones that would ordinarily have plenty of connections to other concepts in daily life. In order to prevent extreme responses, the associative network related to the trauma needs to be compartmentalized and isolated from the rest of a person’s memory networks, or risk anything activating the network and triggering an emergency response. </p><p>Thus, the role of protectors is not just to avoid situations which would be actively dangerous: they also need to manipulate the contents of consciousness so as to avoid triggering the trauma network otherwise. </p><p>Even if someone’s life circumstances have changed, and the original situation which created the trauma is no longer an active issue (such as if someone is an adult and has moved away from their abusive parents), the trauma network may remain too strongly charged to allow its contents to be reprocessed. Reprocessing would require the use of higher cognitive functions to put the experiences in a new context, but any activation of the network will trigger an immediate emergency response, shutting down those very cognitive functions. In such a situation, all that protectors can do is to try to bury the network and suppress all memories related to it. To rephrase that in less intentional language, <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7zQPYQB5EeaqLrhBh/subagents-neural-turing-machines-thought-selection-and"">the brain’s Turing machine</a></u> may come to learn that suppressing particular memories produces beneficial results, reinforcing the behavior. </p><blockquote>Memory loss has been reported in people who have experienced natural disasters, accidents, war trauma, kidnapping, torture, concentration camps, and physical and sexual abuse. Total memory loss is most common in childhood sexual abuse, with incidence ranging from 19 percent to 38 percent. This issue is not particularly controversial: As early as 1980 the DSM-III recognized the existence of memory loss for traumatic events in the diagnostic criteria for dissociative amnesia: “an inability to recall important personal information, usually of a traumatic or stressful nature, that is too extensive to be explained by normal forgetfulness.” Memory loss has been part of the criteria for PTSD since that diagnosis was first introduced. </blockquote><blockquote>One of the most interesting studies of repressed memory was conducted by Dr. Linda Meyer Williams, which began when she was a graduate student in sociology at the University of Pennsylvania in the early 1970s. Williams interviewed 206 girls between the ages of ten and twelve who had been admitted to a hospital emergency room following sexual abuse. Their laboratory tests, as well as the interviews with the children and their parents, were kept in the hospital’s medical records. Seventeen years later Williams was able to track down 136 of the children, now adults, with whom she conducted extensive follow-up interviews. More than a third of the women (38 percent) did not recall the abuse that was documented in their medical records, while only fifteen women (12 percent) said that they had never been abused as children. More than two-thirds (68 percent) reported other incidents of childhood sexual abuse. Women who were younger at the time of the incident and those who were molested by someone they knew were more likely to have forgotten their abuse. (van der Kolk, 2014)</blockquote><p>However, as I will soon discuss, a downside of this process is that the more that associative networks get disconnected from each other, the less consistent a person’s responses to different situations become. If a person is drawing on different memories in different situations, then in some situations they may seem like an entirely different person than in others. Another way of framing is that, if we define a subagent as decision-making entity that has access to its own set of beliefs and goals, then different subagents are in control at different times.</p><h1>A few words on the “memory wars”</h1><p>This post discusses suppressing traumatic memories, drawing on the theories of clinical practitioners, who have disagreements with clinical researchers about whether memory suppression is a thing (Patihis, Ho, Tingen, Lilienfeld, &amp; Loftus, 2014). </p><p>Much of the criticism about repressed memories is aimed at a specific concept from Freudian theory, and/or on the question of how reliable therapeutically recovered memories are. Several of the critics (e.g. (Rofé, 2008)) acknowledge that people may suppress or intentionally forget painful memories, but argue that this is distinct from the Freudian concept of repression. However, memory suppression in the sense discussed in this post is not related to the Freudian concept, and also includes intentional attempts to forget or avoid thinking about something, as the examples will hopefully demonstrate. </p><p>In fact, the memories being <em>hard</em> to forget is exactly the problem, which is something that many critics of the standard Freudian paradigm are keen to point out - traumatic memories are often particularly powerful and long-lasting.</p><p>I do make the assumption that conscious attempts to forget something may eventually become sufficiently automated so as to become impossible for the person themselves to notice; but this seems like a straightforward inference from the observation that skills and habits in general can become automated enough so as to happen without the person realizing what they are doing. A recent experiment (unreplicated, but I have a <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/x4n4jcoDP7xh5LWLq/book-summary-consciousness-and-the-brain#The_book_and_its_replicability"">reasonably high prior</a></u> for cognitive psychology experiments replicating) also showed that once people are trained to intentionally forget words that are associated with a particular cue, the cue will reduce recall of words even when it is paired with them in a form that is too short to consciously register (Salvador et al. 2018).</p><p>I make no strong claims about the reliability of memories recovered in therapy. It has been clearly demonstrated that it is possible for therapists to accidentally or intentionally implant false memories, but there have also been cases of people recovering memories which have then been confirmed from other sources. Probably some recovered memories are genuine (though possibly distorted) and some are not.</p><h1>Mild disconnection: unintegrated considerations and ugh fields</h1><p>In <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7zQPYQB5EeaqLrhBh/subagents-neural-turing-machines-thought-selection-and"">my previous post</a></u>, I mentioned the hypothesis (Shadlen &amp; Shohamy, 2016) that in choosing between several options, we sample memories related to our past experiences with those options. This sampling may draw from several memory networks, located in physically distinct areas in the brain. I also mentioned how particularly negative memories or consideration may draw one’s attention, so as to make it hard to integrate those concerns with the concerns in other networks. And in <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/hnLutdvjC8kPScPAj/integrating-disagreeing-subagents"">Integrating disagreeing subagents</a></u>, I talked about how akrasia might be interpreted in terms of conflicting and unintegrated beliefs pulling in opposite directions.</p><p>In the very mildest form, there isn’t necessarily any trauma at all: just two different associative networks pointing in opposite directions, with concerns that have not been integrated. This might cause different kinds of behavior in different situations, depending on which network happens to become activated. However, once the discrepancy is detected, integration may happen automatically or assisted in a relatively straightforward fashion with techniques such as <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/mQmx4kQQtHeBip9ZC/internal-double-crux"">IDC</a></u>.</p><p>The next level is when a concern is not serious, but still feels somewhat unpleasant to think about - the territory of <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/EFQ3F6kmt4WHXRqik/ugh-fields"">everyday ugh fields</a></u>:</p><blockquote>For example, suppose that you started off in life with a wandering mind and were punished a few times for failing to respond to official letters. Your TDL algorithm began to propagate the pain back to the moment you looked at an official letter or bill. As a result, you would be less effective than average at responding, so you got punished a few more times. Henceforth, when you received a bill, you got the pain before you even opened it, and it laid unpaid on the mantelpiece until a Big Bad Red late payment notice with an $25 fine arrived. More negative conditioning. Now even thinking about a bill, form or letter invokes the flinch response, and your lizard brain has fully cut you out out. You find yourself spending time on internet time-wasters, comfort food, TV, computer games, etc. Your life may not obviously be a disaster, but this is only because you can&#x27;t see the alternative paths that it could have taken if you had been able to take advantage of the opportunities that came as letters and forms with deadlines.</blockquote><blockquote>The subtlety with the Ugh Field is that the flinch occurs before you start to consciously think about how to deal with the Unhappy Thing, meaning that you never deal with it, and you don&#x27;t even have the option of dealing with it in the normal run of things.</blockquote><p>As the post notes, your brain is automatically trying to avoid thinking about things which would trigger the “ugh”. (I’ve certainly noticed in myself a tendency to just conveniently forget about lots of mildly unpleasant things I should get around doing.) Plans which would involve engaging the ugh are ranked low in your preference ordering so are <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/3HyeNiEpvbQQaqeoH/p/RcZeZt8cPk48xxiQ8"">never even generated as options</a></u>. Except that <em>some</em> of your networks <em>do</em> know that you need to engage with the ugh eventually, so they keep annoyingly reminding you about it whenever something happens to activate them.</p><p>Assuming that the ughs are something that you do need to deal with, that is. They could also be something else, such as past upsets and embarrassments that you would prefer to forget, and then keep pushing away until nothing reminds you of them anymore. In that case, the memory network might be successfully locked away and compartmentalized - but still exerting a subtle influence in the form of the now-automated mental motions aimed at making sure that it remains hidden. Those same motions would also prevent the beliefs associated with it from coming up and being re-evaluated.</p><p>A relevant question here is: if a negative memory is suppressed from consciousness, to what extent does it influence decision-making? After all, one might think that if it remains suppressed, then it should not have any effect. But it seems likely that even if the memory itself does not influence decision-making, the hoops that the brain has learned to jump through to keep it suppressed do affect one’s decisions. (Under a subagent framing, those hoops in question would be thought of as a protector.)</p><p>To take a minor example not involving memory suppression, for some reason I did not learn to tie my shoelaces as a child. Instead I just used shoes which did not have laces. After a while, it became kind of embarrassing to not know how to do that, so I developed an identity and preference for using shoes without laces. This lasted well into adulthood, despite the fact it would have been pretty trivial for me to just finally learn how to do it. Yet the thought of asking someone to teach me would have felt embarrassing, so my brain continued using the structures it had developed for avoiding shoelaces. Even if I had somehow suppressed the knowledge of these structures existing because of my embarrassment - something of which I was on some level aware all the time - I very much doubt that that alone would have changed the structures, or reduced my resistance to using shoelaces. It might plausibly even have made things worse, as I would no longer even realize that my identity was a justification constructed to guard against embarrassment. (Eventually I looked up a YouTube video called something like “easiest way of teaching your child to tie their shoelaces” and figured it out.)</p><p>Eliezer says that “<u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/XTWkjCJScy2GFAgDt/dark-side-epistemology"">If you once tell a lie, the truth is ever after your enemy</a></u>” - maintaining one incorrect justification for your behavior may require your brain to contort itself to quite a lot of weird shapes. We all probably know examples of people who seem reasonable and rational on most issues, but then on some they are oddly forceful about their positions, or otherwise do not quite seem to be thinking clearly. (But that’s just <em>other</em> people being irrational, of course. <em>We </em>would never do such a thing.)</p><blockquote>A “big T” trauma (Criterion A event necessary to diagnose PTSD), such as rape, sexual molestation, or combat experience, clearly has an impact on its victims in terms of how they behave, think, and feel about themselves, and in their susceptibility to pronounced symptoms, such as nightmares, flashbacks, and intrusive thoughts. These victims will have self-attributions such as “I’m powerless,” “I’m worthless,” or “I’m not in control.” Of course, clients who have not experienced such traumas may also have dominant negative self-attributions, such as “I’m worthless,” “I’m powerless,” or “I’m going to be abandoned.” Many of these clients seem to have derived their negative self-statements from early childhood experiences. [...] Like “big T” trauma victims, they see the event, feel it, and are profoundly affected by it. </blockquote><blockquote>Such clients were not, of course, blown up in a minefield or molested by a parent. Nevertheless, a memory of something that was said or that happened to them is locked in their brain and seems to have an effect similar to that of a traumatic experience. In fact, by dictionary definition, any event that has had a lasting negative effect on the self or psyche is by its nature “traumatic.” Consequently, these ubiquitous adverse life events have long been referred to in EMDR practice as “small t” traumas to keep in mind the nature of their impact [...]. A wide range of adverse life experiences can be the basis of pathology, because of their emotional impact. For instance, while being humiliated in grade school cannot be designated a “trauma” for the diagnosis of PTSD, on an emotional level, such an event can be considered the evolutionary equivalent of being cut out of the herd. The impact can be affectively devastating, with long-lasting effects. (Shapiro, 2017)</blockquote><h1>Moderate disconnection: unintegrated core beliefs</h1><p>Sometimes a belief network is in some sense too central to just be pushed away: life circumstances force it to be active despite being negatively laden, but that negativity also prevents it from being integrated with other networks. Beliefs about ourselves are a particularly common candidate for this category.</p><blockquote>Imagine that a little girl is walking beside her father and reaches up for his hand. At that moment the father deliberately or inadvertently swings his arm back and hits the child in the face. The child experiences intense negative affect, which might be verbalized as “I can’t get what I want; there is something wrong with me.” [...] The affect, perhaps intense feelings of worthlessness and powerlessness, and the images, sounds, and the pain of the blow are stored in the child’s nervous system. This experience becomes a touchstone, a primary self-defining event in her life; in the Adaptive Information Processing model we call it a node. [...] the next event that represents a similar rejection is likely to link up with the node in the ongoing creation of a neuro network that will be pivotal to the girl’s definition of her self-worth. Subsequent experiences of rejection by mother, siblings, friends, and others may all link up with the node in channels of associated information. Even before language is adequately developed, all the different childhood experiences containing similar feelings of powerlessness, despair, and inadequacy are stored as information linking into a memory network organized around the node of the earlier touchstone experience. Positive experiences are not assimilated into the network because the node is defined by the negative affect.</blockquote><blockquote>When there is sufficient language to formulate a self-concept, such as “I can’t get what I want; there is something wrong with me,” verbalization is linked associatively with the network by the affect that the meaning of those words engenders. In essence, once the affect-laden verbal conceptualization is established in the neuro network, it can be viewed as generalizing to each of the subsequent experiences stored as information in the network. The process continues in adolescence, such as when, for instance, the girl in our example experiences a rejection by a teacher or a boyfriend. Thus, all subsequent related events may link to the same node point and take on the attributions of the initial experience. Therefore, the assessment associated with such an event is not limited to a function-specific statement (e.g., “I can’t get what I want in this instance”), but is linked to the dysfunctional generalized statement “I can’t get what I want; there is something wrong with me.”</blockquote><blockquote>What happens when the girl reaches adulthood and something happens that seems like—or even threatens to become—a rejection? This new information is assimilated into the neuro network, and the concept “I can’t get what I want; there is something wrong with me” and its affect generalize and become associated with it. Over time, the accumulated related events produce a self-fulfilling prophecy; thus, any hint or chance of rejection can trigger the neuro network with its dominant cognition of “There is something wrong with me.” This person’s consequent behavior and attributions in the present are dysfunctional because what motivates and fuels them is the intense affect, fear, pain, and powerlessness of that first experience, now compounded by all of the subsequent experiences. (Shapiro, 2017)</blockquote><p>Despite the prevalence of the negative affect, there is still a strong need to push it away, in order to be able to function normally and experience positive feelings. This leads to something like unstable fluctuation of at least two distinct memory networks taking turns being active. One is loaded with all the negative examples, while another might contain all the positive ones which <u><a href=""https://kajsotala.fi/2017/07/how-i-found-fixed-the-root-problem-behind-my-depression-and-anxiety-after-20-years/"">have not been successfully integrated</a></u> into the negative ones. </p><p>Also, the person in question might understand on an <em>intellectual</em> level that there is nothing actually wrong with them, that this is a negative cognition created by trauma, and so on… but this belief also resides in its own network, separate from the one which is causing the negative experience.</p><h1>Dissociation</h1><p>The examples so far have largely assumed that one is capable of somehow - in principle at least - avoiding the unpleasant situation or trigger. But what if one is not?</p><p>While “fight or flight” are the most commonly known defensive reactions, there are actually several defensive states. Exactly how many and how they should be classified is somewhat disputed, but one model has the following in increasing order of threat imminence: freeze-alert (stopping still and paying attention when noticing something potentially threatening), fight, flight, freeze-fright (if the fight and flight options are unviable), and collapse (feigning death):</p><blockquote>A simple thought experiment illustrates these five defensive options. Imagine that you surprise a large bear while alone in the wilderness. Your immediate stillness is the freeze-alert state. If the bear moves off, you can return home with an exciting story for your family. If the bear approaches, your danger deepens. Neither flight nor fight offers a viable option in this and many other cases of extreme threat, where active defenses increase the risk of death. The best option here is freeze-fright, although your chances are slim unless a hunter is nearby. Finally, when the bear has you in its mouth, you are out of options. You go limp in a state of collapse [...] Collapse reduces the likelihood of continued violence, while preparing the individual for injury or death (release of endogenous opioids decreases pain; [...]). Immobility is the most effective response during attack because quiescence eliminates auditory and visual cues that elicit or maintain aggression. All of these defense states survive in us from our evolutionary past because each has enhanced the odds of survival. (Baldwin 2013)</blockquote><p>“<u><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociation_(psychology)"">Dissociation</a></u>” is a broad term with several meanings; in reference to states of consciousness in particular, it refers to states such as ones in which a person feels detached from the world, up to the point of their experiences feeling unreal, them being unable to see or hear anything, or feeling like they are someone else and watching events which are happening to some stranger. </p><p>Schauer &amp; Elbert (2010) conceptualize dissociative states of consciousness as ones which are related to the freeze and collapse stages of the defensive progression. In global workspace terms, one might frame it as a workspace state which helps - as a part of a wider physiological shutdown - prevent the kinds of more active defensive responses which would put the person in more danger. Many rape and abuse victims describe having had dissociative episodes during their experience.</p><p>The milder, non-pathological forms of dissociative states include e.g. daydreaming, which may help keep the person still in situations such as boring lectures with obligatory attendance, suppressing desires to move elsewhere. The more serious forms may kick in during e.g. repeated abuse a person does not have a chance to escape from, and to protect against memories of such incidents. (Schauer &amp; Elbert also hypothesize that forms of self-harm, such as cutting, may act as ways to self-regulate by escalating one’s defensive state to one of shutdown, calming down stressful memories and responses.) </p><p>If someone is forced to live with their abuser, dissociation may help them remain functional in the abuser’s presence rather than trying to uselessly flee; as dissociative states frequently involve memory deficits, this may further lead to fragmented memory networks.</p><h1>Extreme disconnection: PTSD, personality disorders, DID</h1><p>An extreme case of incomplete memory suppression is PTSD, where the trauma network may be so intense as to completely overwhelm the person whenever it is activated. As a result, cognitive analysis may shut down whenever the network is triggered. The person may become completely flooded with the memory, to the point of reliving it as if they were experiencing the event again. </p><blockquote>Because the overwhelm is so strong, they may afterwards have little memory of what even happened - the cognitive shutdown may suppress the ability to form new memories of the event or to express it in language, leaving the experience completely in a world of its own.</blockquote><blockquote>The overwhelming experience is split off and fragmented, so that the emotions, sounds, images, thoughts, and physical sensations related to the trauma take on a life of their own. The sensory fragments of memory intrude into the present, where they are literally relived. As long as the trauma is not resolved, the stress hormones that the body secretes to protect itself keep circulating, and the defensive movements and emotional responses keep getting replayed. [...] </blockquote><blockquote>… many people may not be aware of the connection between their “crazy” feelings and reactions and the traumatic events that are being replayed. They have no idea why they respond to some minor irritation as if they were about to be annihilated. Flashbacks and reliving are in some ways worse that the trauma itself. A traumatic event has a beginning and an end—at some point it is over. But for people with PTSD a flashback can occur at any time, whether they are awake or asleep. There is no way of knowing when it’s going to occur again or how long it will last. People who suffer from flashbacks often organize their lives around trying to protect against them. They may compulsively go to the gym to pump iron (but finding that they are never strong enough), numb themselves with drugs, or try to cultivate an illusory sense of control in highly dangerous situations (like motorcycle racing, bungee jumping, or working as an ambulance driver). Constantly fighting unseen dangers is exhausting and leaves them fatigued, depressed, and weary. (van der Kolk 2014)</blockquote><p>There is debate about whether or not DID is a real phenomenon. I do not have the expertise to have a strong opinion on this, but to the extent that it is, it could be considered a more extreme version of the dissociative responses described in the previous sections. Forced to live for an extended time in extreme circumstances with contradictory demands - such as being required to be happy and obedient while also being the subject of regular extreme abuse - a child may develop extreme amnesiac walls between different memory networks, to the point of having an entirely different personality depending on which network happens to be active. This allows for feelings of fear or panic that would otherwise arise in the company of an abusive parent, to be kept away as the memories associated with the abuse cannot be accessed.</p><p>Several clinicians also consider borderline personality disorder to be a <u><a href=""https://theconversation.com/we-need-to-treat-borderline-personality-disorder-for-what-it-really-is-a-response-to-trauma-115549"">PTSD-like response to trauma</a></u>, with symptoms such as extreme fears of abandonment, <u><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splitting_(psychology)"">alternation between idealization and devaluation</a></u>, and poor emotional regulation being caused by the kinds of mechanisms that I have been describing.</p><p>In cases of sufficient trauma, an extreme form of dissociation seems to happen, where protectors extensively shut down access to bodily sensations and emotional awareness, turning off any systems which might cause emotional reactions that would be too strong for the system to handle:</p><blockquote>While Sherry dutifully came to every appointment and answered my questions with great sincerity, I did not feel we were making the sort of vital connection that is necessary for therapy to work. Struck by how frozen and uptight she was, I suggested that she see Liz, a massage therapist I had worked with previously. During their first meeting Liz positioned Sherry on the massage table, then moved to the end of the table and gently held Sherry’s feet. Lying there with her eyes closed, Sherry suddenly yelled in a panic: “Where are you?” Somehow Sherry had lost track of Liz, even though Liz was right there, with her hands on Sherry’s feet.</blockquote><blockquote>Sherry was one of the first patients who taught me about the extreme disconnection from the body that so many people with histories of trauma and neglect experience. [...] Once I was alerted to this, I was amazed to discover how many of my patients told me they could not feel whole areas of their bodies. Sometimes I’d ask them to close their eyes and tell me what I had put into their outstretched hands. Whether it was a car key, a quarter, or a can opener, they often could not even guess what they were holding—their sensory perceptions simply weren’t working. [...]</blockquote><blockquote>In response to the trauma itself, and in coping with the dread that persisted long afterward, these patients had learned to shut down the brain areas that transmit the visceral feelings and emotions that accompany and define terror. Yet in everyday life, those same brain areas are responsible for registering the entire range of emotions and sensations that form the foundation of our self-awareness, our sense of who we are. What we witnessed here was a tragic adaptation: In an effort to shut off terrifying sensations, they also deadened their capacity to feel fully alive. (van der Kolk, 2014)</blockquote><h1>Takeaway: emotional healing as a prerequisite for rationality</h1><p>In this post, I have covered ways in which painful experiences - anything from “big-T Trauma” to mildly unpleasant thoughts - seem to shape our thinking. Everyone has a built-in desire to avoid painful thoughts and experiences, which reinforces cognitive patterns aimed at keeping those kinds of thoughts hidden and buried. Often this is functional, as keeping them suppressed allows us to remain more functional in situations where it would not be useful for old and non-relevant memories to come up, causing fear and avoidance responses when we need to be doing something else.</p><p>At the same, these kinds of processes control that which we can think; and as they become automated, they nudge our reasoning to take weird contortions, keeping our belief networks fragmented and our behavior less than <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/oJwJzeZ6ar2Hr7KAX/subagents-akrasia-and-coherence-in-humans"">coherent</a></u>, operating in <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7zQPYQB5EeaqLrhBh/subagents-neural-turing-machines-thought-selection-and#Practical_relevance"">ways that keep themselves hidden</a></u>. They also limit us with regard to instrumental rationality, as options which we could otherwise have taken - anything from wearing particular kinds of shoes to taking up new careers which <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/JTzxg7y5HFYBBWfBj/identities-are-subconscious-strategies"">challenge our chosen identities</a></u> - are judged as categorically unacceptable.</p><p>To <u><a href=""https://www.readthesequences.com/Book-II-How-To-Actually-Change-Your-Mind"">actually change your mind</a></u>, you need to be able to dig up and address your past traumas.

rAY47fnRA9NzgYcRW,Natural laws should be explicit constraints on strategy space,natural-laws-should-be-explicit-constraints-on-strategy,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/rAY47fnRA9NzgYcRW/natural-laws-should-be-explicit-constraints-on-strategy,2019-08-13T20:22:47.933Z,8,3,6,False,False,,"<p>Mostly strategic developments have been about incrementing beyond whatever the other person is doing. Sometimes there are paradigm shifts, which largely mean a different dimension along which to make incremental improvements.</p><p>But we cannot increment forever. Sometimes there is a well-understood limit we cannot surpass. Energy-Maneuverability theory is a paradigm for designing air superiority fighters. Though the paradigm shifted from the old speed/altitude/turn metrics, we remained constrained by the ability of the human pilot to withstand g forces. We have already built aircraft which can climb higher, accelerate faster, and turn more sharply than men can tolerate without passing out. It may even be possible to design an almost-perfect manned fighter, in which the pilot is the constraint in all dimensions of performance.</p><p>But now we have unmanned drones.</p><p>Natural law provides a variety of limits, like the speed of light or the increase of entropy. We have a good command of natural law at the scale where warmachines operate. It seems like it would be a good policy to adopt these as the constraints on strategy-space, and map what we know about our opponents to them. This would have the benefit of letting us know how much room there even is for incremental improvements, and give us some indication of where we are vulnerable to (or have an opportunity to create) a paradigm shift.</p><p>Since most of these natural limits are well known, and most dimensions of strategy don't have something obvious like <em>c,</em> there isn't an obvious motivation for it. But it feels to me like even something as conceptually straightforward as using operations research or <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"">mathematical programming</a> would work for this.</p>",ryan_b,ryan_b,ryan_b,

If we would like to say this has a truth value, we need to imagine what such a counterfactual world would have looked like: was it because Lincoln (somehow) survived his wounds, John Wilkes Booth (somehow) missed, that the plot was (somehow) discovered the day before, etc. Somehow, we must pick out the world that is in some sense &quot;closest&quot; to our actual world, but it seems very difficult to compare any two such worlds in a principled way.</p><p>To formalize <a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.05060.pdf"">Functional Decision Theory</a> (FDT), we likely need to have a better understanding of counterfactuals, although even in restricted mathematical contexts, we don&#x27;t have a satisfactory understanding of why &quot;If 0 = 1...&quot; simply returns incoherence, yet &quot;If the Modularity Theorem were false...&quot; seemingly conjures up a possible world that we feel we can reason about.</p><p>(Also, in terms of corrigibility, we are often interested in formalizing the notion of &quot;low-impact&quot; agents, and the naive idea one often has is to define a distance metric on counterfactual world-states, as in p. 5 of <a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.06565.pdf"">Concrete Problems in AI Safety</a>).</p><h2>Algorithmic Similarity</h2><p>In the FDT framework, we do not view ourselves as a solitary agent, but as a <em>function </em>(or algorithm) that can be copied, modified, and read, and we wish to maximize the utility achieved by our algorithm. Minor details of our implementation that don&#x27;t affect our behavior (such as whether we are written in Java or Python) should not be decision-relevant, and if some algorithm does the same thing as us &quot;most&quot; of the time, then we would probably (e.g.) want to cooperate with it in a Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma. Defining what it means for two algorithms to be similar remains an outstanding open problem.</p><p>At MSFP 2018, a small group (4-5) of us tried tackling this for a couple hours, had a few ideas that &quot;felt&quot; promising, but gradually realized that none of these made any sense, until ultimately we gave up with the feeling that we hadn&#x27;t made any intellectual advances. I only say this to give outside-view evidence of intractability, but it&#x27;s difficult for me to concisely communicate <em>why</em> its hard (I could say &quot;try it yourself for an hour and you&#x27;ll see&quot;, but part of my point is that hour is better spent). For those who insist on <em>inside-view</em> evidence, here&#x27;s an outline of one of the ideas we had and why it turned out to be unworkable:</p><p>We attempted to partition algorithm-space into equivalence classes that represent &quot;conceptual similarity&quot;, which should not be harder than defining a distance function on the space. By the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry%E2%80%93Howard_correspondence"">Curry-Howard correspondence</a>, we can rephrase this as asking when two proofs are similar (this felt easier for us to think about, but that&#x27;s entirely subjective). Suppose we have some proof A of size n, and we want to find proofs that &quot;don&#x27;t use any fundamentally different ideas&quot;. The obvious approach is to think of which proofs we can get to with minor edits. If we make some edit of size ϵ⋅n for some small ϵ and the result is still a valid proof, it should be more or less the same. If we take the closure under minor edits that preserve validity, it would seem superficially plausible that this would result in proofs that are similar. However, suppose we discover a one-line proof B that&#x27;s totally different from A: then we can append it to A as a minor edit, then gradually delete A with minor edits, until we have a drastically different proof (among other complications).</p><h2>Adversarial Examples</h2><p>Given some data point x correctly classified by an ML model, a new point x′:=x+ϵ is an <em><a href=""https://openai.com/blog/adversarial-example-research/"">adversarial example</a></em> if it is now misclassified, despite only differing from x by a tiny amount ϵ (i.e. making relatively small RGB changes to a few pixels). For <em>every</em> state-of-the-art image classifier tested, if you give me:</p><ul><li><em>Any</em> image classified correctly by that model</li><li><em>Any</em> target class you would like to have the model misclassify the image as</li></ul><p>Then one can usually find some small perturbation of that image that the model believes is in the target class with high probability.</p><p>In the classic example we can have GoogLeNet classify a <a href=""https://imgur.com/a/Br8SGxZ"">panda as a gibbon</a> with 99% confidence. Moreover, these have been found to generalize very well across different models, even with very different architectures. Last year, a <a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.08195.pdf"">paper</a> came out taking this further, by obtaining adversarial examples with the best cross-generalization, and giving these to humans who had only a few seconds to classify the image. Interestingly, the humans were &quot;fooled&quot; in the sense that their snap judgments--those formed by their pure visual system--differed from how they classified the images when given more time for reflection. In terms of robustness to these examples, it seems, our perceptual system by itself is not qualitatively better than today&#x27;s classifiers, but <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/46qnWRSR7L2eyNbMA/the-lens-that-sees-its-flaws"">our lens can see its own flaws</a>.</p><p>The paper was popularized in various places under a bolder headline, namely that there now existed full-blown adversarial examples <em>for humans</em> (reflection or not). This was showcased with a <a href=""https://twitter.com/goodfellow_ian/status/966853052140470272?lang=en"">picture</a> from a different part of the paper showing an image of a (somewhat dog-like) cat being given a tiny amount of noise, and subsequently looking like a dog to a human with any amount of visual processing and top-down feedback. This sparked controversy, with many pointing out that a small change (in RGB values) to some visual concept does not necessarily correspond to a small change in concept-space. The paper itself punted on this: </p><blockquote>it is philosophically difficult to define the real object class for an image that is not a picture of a real object. In this work, we assume that an adversarial image is misclassified if the output label differs from the human-provided label of the clean image that was used as the starting point for the adversarial image. We make small adversarial perturbations and we assume that these small perturbations are insufficient to change the true class. </blockquote><p>And in response to comments, co-author Ian Goodfellow <a href=""https://twitter.com/goodfellow_ian/status/967200391673692162"">acknowledged on Twitter</a>:</p><blockquote>While everyone else was scrambling to finish running experiments for ICML, my co-authors and I were having intense debates about philosophy and semantics and how to write the paper. Some of our open office colleagues were entertained by how surreal this sounded. </blockquote><p>Making models robust against adversarial examples remains an outstanding and difficult topic with a considerable paper trail. The problem of merely <em>verifying</em> that a given model has no local adversarial examples (e.g. within a few RGB values of a given data point) has been the subject of <a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.02802.pdf"">some</a> <a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.06940.pdf"">interesting</a> formal verification work in the past couple years. But to even do this verification work, one needs a formal specification of what an adversarial example is, which in turn requires a formal specification of what a &quot;small change&quot; between (e.g.) images is, that somehow captures something about <em>conceptual</em> distance. It seems to me that even this smaller problem will be hard to solve in a philosophically satisfying way because of the inherent subjectivity/fuzziness in defining &quot;distance in concept-space&quot; or anything that even comes close.</p><h2>Distance Functions are Hard: The Evidence</h2><p>What we are asking for, in all these instances, is some distance function precise enough to be mathematizable in some form, but robust enough to include many very fuzzy desiderata we have in mind. It seems natural to ask what distance functions of this form have been successfully developed before. The <a href=""https://www.amazon.co.uk/Encyclopedia-Distances-Michel-Marie-Deza/dp/3662528436"">Encyclopedia of Distances</a> comes out to over 700 pages, split roughly in half between those distances used in pure math (especially, as one would expect, topology, geometry, and functional analysis), and those used in applied math, computing disciplines, and the natural sciences.</p><p>Of the distance functions listed in the latter half, most were simply &quot;the obvious thing one would do&quot; given the preexisting mathematical structure around the topic in question (e.g. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance"">Levenshtein distance</a> on strings). Others were less obvious, but usually because they used nontrivial mathematical machinery to answer specific mathematical questions, not to actually shed light on fuzzy philosophical questions one would have about it.</p><p>Getting to the social science section, where no existing mathematical formalism existed on most of the topics in the first place, virtually none of the distances particularly helped to remedy this fuzziness by themselves. Though I do not claim to have spent that much time flipping through this tome, never did I see a distance notion that struck me as a profound non-mathematical insight, or that even gestured at an &quot;art of coming up with distance functions&quot;.</p><h2>Conclusions</h2><p>I conclude, with medium confidence, that each of the questions posed in the first 3 sections will be particularly hard to answer in a satisfying way, and if they are, then probably this won&#x27;t be by thinking about distance functions directly.</p><p>As a general heuristic, I feel like if you&#x27;ve reduced a philosophical problem to &quot;defining the appropriate distance function&quot;, then it&#x27;s worth pausing to consider if you&#x27;ve made a <a href=""https://meaningness.com/wrong-way-reduction"">wrong-way reduction</a>. Chances are, the distance function you want is inherently value-laden, and so the problem of defining it inherits the difficulty of the value alignment problem itself.</p><p>I also think this heuristic is especially salient if you&#x27;re trying to capture something like &quot;conceptual similarity/distance&quot;: if you could do this, then you&#x27;d have an objective map/taxonomy of (a large fraction of) concept-space.</p>",Grue_Slinky,grue_slinky,Grue_Slinky,

<p>There is a tide in the affairs of men. It cycles with a period of about three hundred years. During its flood, farms and businesses prosper, and great empires enjoy golden ages. During its ebb, war and famine stalk the land, and states collapse into barbarism. </p>
<p><img src=""http://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/cycles0.JPG"" /><br />
<i>Chinese population over time</i></p>
<p>At least this is the thesis of Peter Turchin and Sergey Nefedov, authors of <i><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Secular-Cycles-Peter-Turchin-ebook/dp/B005CQAIPE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=secular+cycles&amp;qid=1565667249&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=slatestarcode-20&amp;linkId=da31e3932a02d1b51619821be1c5ea3c&amp;language=en_US"">Secular Cycles</a></i>. They start off Malthusian: due to natural reproduction, population will keep increasing until it reaches the limits of what the land can support. At that point, everyone will be stuck at subsistence level. If any group ever enjoys a standard of living above subsistence level, they will keep reproducing until they are back down at subsistence.</p>
<p>Standard Malthusian theory evokes images of a population stable at subsistence level forever. But Turchin and Nefedov argues this isn’t how it works. A population at subsistence will always be one meal away from starving. When a famine hits, many of them will starve. When a plague hits, they will already be too sickly to fight it off. When conflict arrives, they will be desperate enough to enlist in the armies of whichever warlord can offer them a warm meal.</p>
<p>These are not piecemeal events, picking off just enough of the population to bring it back to subsistence. They are great cataclysms. The Black Plague killed 30% – 60% of Europeans; the Antonine Plague of Rome was almost as deadly. The Thirty Years War killed 25% – 40% of Germans; the Time of Troubles may have killed half the population of medieval Russia.</p>
<p>Thus the secular cycle. When population is low, everyone has more than enough land. People grow rich and reproduce. As time goes on, the same amount of farmland gets split among more and more people. Wages are driven down to subsistence. War, Famine, and Pestilence ravage the land, with Death not far behind. The killings continue until population is low again, at which point the cycle starts over.</p>
<p>This applies mostly to peasants, who are most at risk of starving. But nobles go through a related process. As a cycle begins, their numbers are low. As time goes on, their population expands, both through natural reproduction and through upward mobility. Eventually, there are more nobles than there are good positions…</p>
<p>(this part confused me a little. Shouldn’t number of good positions scale with population? IE if one baron rules 1,000 peasants, the number of baronial positions should scale with the size of a society. I think T&amp;N hint at a few answers. First, some positions are absolute rather than relative, eg “King” or “Minister of the Economy”. Second, noble numbers may <i>sometimes</i> increase faster than peasant numbers, since nobles have more food and better chances to reproduce. Third, during boom times, the ranks of nobles are swelled through upward mobility. Fourth, conspicuous consumption is a ratchet effect: during boom times, the expectations of nobility should gradually rise. Fifth, sometimes the relevant denominator is not peasants but land: if a noble only has one acre of land, it doesn’t matter how many peasants he controls. Sixth nobles usually survive famines and plagues pretty well, so after those have done their work, there are far fewer peasants but basically the same number of nobles. All of these factors contribute to excess noble population – or as T&amp;N call it, “elite overproduction”)</p>
<p>…and the nobles form “rival patronage networks” to fight for the few remaining good spots. The state goes from united (or at least all nobles united against the peasants) to divided, with coalitions of nobles duking it out (no pun intended). This can lead either to successful peasant rebellion, as some nobles support the peasants as part of inter-noble power plays, or just to civil war. Although famine and plague barely affect nobles, war affects them disproportionately – both because they are often knights or other front-line soldiers, and because killing the other side’s nobles was a major strategic goal (think Game of Thrones). So a civil war usually further depletes the already-depleted peasant population, and finally depletes noble populations, leading to a general underpopulation and the beginning of the next cycle.</p>
<p><img src=""http://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/cycles1.png"" /></p>
<p>Combine these two processes, and you get the basic structure of a secular cycle. There are about a hundred years of unalloyed growth, as peasant and noble populations rebound from the last disaster. During this period, the economy is strong, the people are optimistic and patriotic, and the state is strong and united. </p>
<p>After this come about fifty years of “stagflation”. There is no more room for easy growth, but the system is able to absorb the surplus population without cracking. Peasants may not have enough land, but they go to the city in search of jobs. Nobles may not have enough of the positions they want, but they go to college in order to become bureaucrats, or join the retinues of stronger nobles. The price of labor reaches its lowest point, and the haves are able to exploit the desperation of the have-nots to reach the zenith of their power. From the outside, this period can look like a golden age: huge cities buzzing with people, universities crammed with students, ultra-rich nobles throwing money at the arts and sciences. From the inside, for most people it will look like a narrowing of opportunity and a hard-to-explain but growing sense that something is wrong.</p>
<p>After this comes a crisis. The mechanisms that have previously absorbed surplus population fail. Famine and disease ravage the peasantry. State finances fall apart. Social trust and patriotism disappear as it becomes increasingly obvious that it’s every man for himself and that people with scruples will be defeated or exploited by people without.</p>
<p>After this comes the depression period (marked “intercycle” on this graph, but I’m going to stick with the book’s term). This graph makes it look puny, but it can last 100 to 150 years. During this period, the peasant population is low, but the noble population is still high. This is most likely a period of very weak or even absent state power, frequent barbarian invasions, and frequent civil war. The peasant population is in a good position to expand, but cannot do so because wars keep killing people off or forcing them into walled towns where they can’t do any farming. Usually it takes a couple more wars and disasters before the noble population has decreased enough to reverse elite overproduction. At this point the remaining nobles look around, decide that there is more than enough for all of them, and feel incentivized to cooperate with the formation of a strong centralized state.</p>
<p>This cycle is interwoven with a second 40-60 year process that T&amp;N call the “fathers-and-sons cycle” or “bigenerational cycle”. The data tend to show waves of disorder about every 40-60 years. During the “integrative trend” (T&amp;N’s term for the optimistic growth and stagflation phases), these can just be minor protests or a small rebellion that is easily crushed. During the “disintegrative trend” (crisis + depression), they usually represent individual outbreaks of civil war. For example, during the Roman Republic, the violence around the death of Tiberius Gracchus in 133 BC was relatively limited, because Rome had not yet entered its crisis phase. 40 years later, in the depths of the crisis phase, there was a second outbreak of violence (91 – 82 BC) including the Social War and Sulla’s wars, which escalated to full-scale (though limited) civil war. 40 years later there was a third outbreak (49 – 27 BC) including Caesar and Augustus’s very large civil wars. After that the new integrative trend started and further violence was suppressed.</p>
<p><img src=""https://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/cycles2.jpg"" /><br />
<i>I’m not sure this even makes sense in the Secular Cycle system, since it should apply only to individual countries and not to the entire world, but these sure are some interesting data.</i></p>
<p>In <i>Secular Cycles</i>, T&amp;N mostly just identifies this pattern from the data and doesn’t talk a lot about what causes it. But in some of Turchin’s other work, he applies some of the math used to model epidemics in public health. His model imagines three kinds of people: naives, radicals, and moderates. At the start of a cycle, most people are naive, with a few radicals. Radicals gradually spread radicalism, either by converting their friends or provoking their enemies (eg a terrorist attack by one side convinces previously disengaged people to join the other side). This spreads like any other epidemic. But as violence gets worse, some people convert to “moderates”, here meaning not “wishy-washy people who don’t care” but something more like “people disenchanted with the cycle of violence, determined to get peace at any price”. Moderates suppress radicals, but as they die off most people are naive and the cycle begins again. Using various parameters for his model Turchin claims this predicts the forty-to-sixty year cycle of violence observed in the data.</p>
<p>So this is the basic thesis of <i>Secular Cycles</i>. Pre-industrial history operates on two cycles: first, a three-hundred year cycle of the rise-and-fall of civilizations. And second, a 40-60 year cycle of violent disorder that only becomes relevant during the lowest parts of the first cycle.</p>
<p><b>II.</b></p>
<p>This is all in the first chapter of the book! The next eight chapters are case studies of eight different historical periods and how they followed the secular cycle model.</p>
<p>For example, Chapter 7 is on the Roman Empire. It starts with Augustus in 27 BC. The Roman Republic has just undergone a hundred years of civil war, from the Gracchi to Marius to Sulla to Pompey to Caesar to Antony. All of this decreased its population by 30% from its second-century peak. That means things are set to get a lot better very quickly.</p>
<p>The expansion phase of the Empire lasted from Augustus (27 BC) to Nerva (96 AD), followed by a stagflation phase from Nerva to Antonius Pius (165 AD). Throughout both phases, the population grew – from about 40 million in Augustus’ day to 65 million in Antonius’. Wheat prices stayed stable until Nerva, then doubled from the beginning of the second century to its end. Legionary pay followed the inverse pattern, staying stable until Nerva and then decreasing by a third before 200. The finances of the state were the same – pretty good until the late second century (despite occasional crazy people becoming Emperor and spending the entire treasury building statues of themselves), but cratering during the time of Marcus Aurelius and Commodus (who debased the denarius down to only 2 g silver).</p>
<p>Throughout expansion and stagflation, the Empire was relatively peaceful (the “Pax Romana”). Sure, occasionally a crazy person would become Emperor and they would have to kill him. There was even one small civil war which lasted all of a year (69 AD). But in general, these were isolated incidents.</p>
<p>Throughout the expansion phase, upward mobility was high and income inequality relatively low. T&amp;N measure this as how many consuls (the highest position in the Roman governmental hierarchy) had fathers who were also consuls. This decreased throughout the first century – from 46% to 18% – then started creeping back up during the stagflation phase to reach 32% at the end of the second century.</p>
<p>The crisis phase began in 165 AD at the peak of Rome’s population and wealth. The Antonine Plague ravaged the Empire, killing up to 30% of the population. Fifteen years later, the century-long dominance of the Good Emperors ended, and Commodus took the throne. Then he was murdered and Pertinax took the throne. Then he was murdered and Didius Julianus took the throne. Then he was murdered and Septimius Severus took the throne.</p>
<p>Now we are well into the disintegrative trend, and the shorter 40-60 year cycle comes into play. Septimus Severius founds a dynasty that lasts 41 years, until Septimius Alexander (the cousin of the grandson of Septimius Severus’ sister-in-law; it’s complicated) was assassinated by his own soldiers in Germany. This begins the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crisis_of_the_Third_Century"">Crisis Of The Third Century</a>, a time of constant civil war, mass depopulation, and economic collapse. The Five Good Emperors of the second century ruled 84 years between them (average of 17 years per emperor). The fifty year Crisis included 27 emperors, for an average of less than 2 years per emperor.</p>
<p>Finally, in 284, Emperor Diocletian ended the civil wars, re-established centralized authority, and essentially refounded the Roman Empire – a nice round 310 years after Augustus did the same. T&amp;N mark this as the end of a secular cycle and the beginning of a new integrative trend. </p>
<p>T&amp;N are able to tell this story. But they don’t just tell the story. They are able to cite various statistics to back themselves up. The Roman population statistics. The price of wheat and other foodstuffs. The average wages for laborers. They especially like coin hoards – the amount of buried treasure from a given period discovered by treasure-hunters – because they argue you only bury your money during times of instability, so this forms a semi-objective way of measuring how unstable things are.</p>
<p>They are at their best when presenting very broad summary statistics. For example, Roman industry produced vast amounts of lead, which entered the atmosphere and settled into the Greenland ice sheet. Here is Roman lead output per year as measured in ice cores:</p>
<p><img src=""https://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/cycles3.jpg"" /></p>
<p>This shows four peaks for the four cycles T&amp;N identify in Rome: the Kingdom, the Republic, the Early Empire of Augustus (Principate, the one described above), and the Late Empire of Diocletian (Dominate). It even shows a sawtooth-y pattern corresponding to the shorter bigenerational cycles.</p>
<p>Or here is building activity in Rome, measured by how many buildings archaeologists have found from a given time:</p>
<p><img src=""https://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/cycles4.png"" /></p>
<p>This is a little less perfect (why is there a big gap in the middle of the Principate? I guess Augustus is a hard act to follow, building-wise) but it still looks good for the cycle theory.</p>
<p>And here is an Index Of Political Instability, which “combines measures of duration, intensity, and scale of political instability events, coded by a team of professional historians”:</p>
<p><img src=""https://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/cycles5.png"" /></p>
<p>Rome is the one on top. Instability clearly peaks during the crisis-depression phases between T&amp;N’s secular cycles – again with a sawtooth pattern representing the bigenerational cycles.</p>
<p><b>III.</b></p>
<p>Seeing <a href=""http://unsongbook.com/interlude-%D7%91-the-code-of-the-world/"">patterns in random noise</a> is one of the basic human failure modes. <i>Secular Cycles</i> is so <i>prima facie</i> crackpottish that it should require mountains of data before we even start wondering if it <i>might</i> be true. I want to make it clear that the book – plus Turchin individually in some of his other books and papers – provides these mountains. I can’t show every single case study, graph, and table in this book review. But the chapter above on the Roman Principate included 25 named figures and graphs, plus countless more informal presentations of data series, from “real wages of agricultural laborers in Roman Egypt during the second century” to “mean annual real land rents for wheat fields in artabas per aroura, 27 BC to 268 CE” to “imperial handouts per reign-year” to “importation of African red slip ware into the Albegna Valley of Etruria, 100 – 600”. And this is just one chapter, randomly chosen. There are seven others just like this. This book understands the burden of proof it is under, and does everything it can to meet it.</p>
<p>Still, we should be skeptical. How many <a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/11/05/the-pyramid-and-the-garden/"">degrees of freedom</a> do T&amp;N have, and is it enough to undermine their case?</p>
<p>First, they get some freedom in the civilizations they use as case studies. They could have searched through every region and period and cherry-picked eight civilizations that rose and fell over a periods of three hundred years. Did they? I don’t think so. The case studies are England, France, Rome, and Russia. These are some of the civilizations of greatest interest to the English-speaking world (except Russia, which makes sense in context because the authors are both Russian). They’re also some of the civilizations best-studied by Anglophone historians and with the most data available (the authors’ methodology requires having good time-series of populations, budgets, food production, etc).</p>
<p>Also, it’s not too hard to look at the civilizations they didn’t study and fill in the gaps. The book barely mentions China, but it seems to fit the model pretty well (“the empire united longs to divide; divided longs to unite”). In fact, taking the quotation completely seriously – the empire was first united during the Qin Dynasty starting in 221 BC, which lasted only 20 years before seguing into the Han Dynasty in 202 BC. The Han expanded and prospered for about a century, had another century of complicated intrigue and frequently revolt, and then ended in disaster in the first part of the first century, with a set of failed reforms, civil war, the sack of the capital, some more civil war, peasant revolt, and even more civil war. The separate period of the Eastern Han Dynasty began in 25 AD, about 240 years after the beginning of the Qin-Han cycle. The Eastern Han also grew and prospered for about a hundred years, then had another fifty years of simmering discontent, then fell apart in about 184 AD, with another series of civil wars, peasant rebellions, etc. This was the Three Kingdoms Period during which “the empire united longs to divide, divided longs to unite” was written to describe. It lasted another eighty years until 266 AD, after which the Jin Dynasty began. The Jin Dynasty was kind of crap, but it lasted another 180 years until 420, followed by 160 years of division, followed by the Sui and Tang dynasties, which were not crap. So I don’t think it takes too much pattern-matching to identify a Western-Han-to-Eastern-Han Cycle of 240 years, followed by an Eastern-Han-to-Jin Cycle of 241 years, followed by a Jin-to-Sui/Tang-Cycle of 324 years.</p>
<p>One could make a more hostile analysis. Is it really fair to lump the Western Jin and Eastern Jin conveniently together, but separate the Western Han and Eastern Han conveniently apart? Is it really fair to call the crappy and revolt-prone Jin Dynasty an “integrative trend” rather than a disintegrative trend that lasted much longer than the theory should predict? Is it really fair to round off cycles of 240 and 320 years to “basically 300 years”?</p>
<p>I think the answer to all of these is “T&amp;N aren’t making predictions about the length of Chinese dynasties, they’re making predictions about the nature of secular cycles, which are correlated with dynasties but not identical to them”. If I had the equivalent to lead core readings for China, or an “instability index”, or time series data for wages or health or pottery importation or so on, maybe it would be perfectly obvious that the Eastern and Western Han defined two different periods, but the Eastern and Western Jin were part of the same period – the same way one look at the lead core data for Rome shows that the Julio-Claudian dynasty vs. the Flavian Dynasty is not an interesting transition.</p>
<p>A secondary answer might be that T&amp;N admit all sorts of things can alter the length of secular cycles. They tragically devote only a few pages to “Ibn Khaldun cycles”, the theory of 14th century Arabic historian Ibn Khaldun that civilizations in the Maghreb rise and fall on a one hundred year period. But they discuss it just enough to say their data confirm Ibn Khaldun’s observations. The accelerated timescale (100 vs. 300 years) is because the Maghreb is massively polygynous, with successful leaders having harems of hundreds of concubines. This speeds up the elite overproduction process and makes everything happen in fast-forward. T&amp;N also admit that their theory only describes civilizations insofar as they are self-contained. This approximately holds for hegemons like Rome at its height, but fails for eg Poland, whose history is going to be much more influenced by when Russia or Germany decides to invade than by the internal mechanisms of Polish society. Insofar as external shocks – whether climatic, foreign military, or whatever else – affect a civilization, secular cycles will be stretched out, compressed, or just totally absent.</p>
<p>This sort of thing must obviously be true, and it’s good T&amp;N say it, but it’s also a free pass to add as many epicycles as you need to explain failure to match data. All I can say looking at China is that, if you give it some wiggle room, it seems to fit T&amp;N’s theories okay. The same is true of a bunch of other civilizations I plugged in to see if they would work.</p>
<p>Second, T&amp;N get some degrees of freedom based on what statistics they use. In every case, they present statistics that support the presence of secular cycles, but they’re not the same statistics in every case. On the one hand, this is unavoidable; we may not have good wage data for every civilization, and levels of pottery importation might be more relevant to ancient Rome than to 19th-century Russia. On the other hand, I’m not sure what prevents them from just never mentioning the Instability Index if the Instability Index doesn’t show what they want it to show.</p>
<p>Here are some random Rome-related indicators I found online:</p>
<p><img src=""https://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/cycles6.PNG"" /></p>
<p>None of them show the same four-peaked Kingdom-Republic-Principate-Dominate pattern as the ones <i>Secular Cycles</i> cites, or the ones Turchin has online.</p>
<p>Third, a lot of the statistics themselves have some degrees of freedom. A lot of them are things like “Instability Index” or “Index of Social Well-Being” or “General Badness Index”. These seem like the kind of scores you can fiddle with to get the results you want. Turchin claims he hasn’t fiddled with them – his instability index is taken from a 1937 paper I haven’t been able to find. But how many papers like that are there? Am I getting too conspiratorial now?</p>
<p>Likewise, we don’t have direct access to the budget of the Roman Empire (or Plantagenet England, or…). Historians have tried to reconstruct it based on archaeology and the few records that have survived. T&amp;N cite these people, and the people they cite are at the top of their fields and say what T&amp;N say they say. But how much flexibility did they have in deciding which estimate of the Roman budget to cite? Is there enough disagreement that they could cite the high estimate for one period and the low estimate for another, then prove it had gone down? I don’t know (though a few hours’ work ought to be enough to establish this).</p>
<p>I wish I could find commentary by other academics and historians on <i>Secular Cycles</i>, or Turchin’s work more generally. I feel like somebody should either be violently debunking this, or else throwing the authors a ticker-tape parade for having solved history. Neither is happening. The few comments I can find are mostly limited to naval gazing about whether history should be quantitative or qualitative. The few exceptions I can find are <a href=""https://www.overcomingbias.com/2017/02/cycles-of-war-empire.html"">blog posts by</a> <a href=""http://www.razib.com/wordpress/2010/02/16/10-questions-for-peter-turchin-3/"">people I know and</a> <a href=""http://rationallyspeakingpodcast.org/show/rs03-can-history-be-a-science.html"">respect urging me</a> to read Turchin five years ago, advice I am sorry for not taking. If you know of any good criticism, please tell me where to find it.</p>
<p>Until then, my very quick double-checking suggests T&amp;N are pretty much on the level. But there could still be subtler forms of overfitting going on that I don’t know enough about history to detect.</p>
<p><b>IV.</b></p>
<p>If this is true, does it have any implications for people today?</p>
<p>First, a very weak implication: it makes history easier to learn. I was shocked how much more I remembered about the Plantagenets, Tudors, Capetians after reading this book than after reading any normal history book about them. I think the secret ingredient is structure. If history is just “one damn thing after another”, there’s no framework for figuring out what matters, what’s worth learning, what follows what else. The secular cycle idea creates a structure that everything fits into neatly. I know that the Plantagenet Dynasty lasted from 1154 – 1485, because it <i>had to</i>, because that’s a 331 year secular cycle. I know that the important events to remember include the Anarchy of 1135 – 1153 and the War of the Roses from 1455 – 1487, because those are the two crisis-depression periods that frame the cycle.  I know that after 1485 Henry Tudor took the throne and began a new age of English history, because that’s the beginning of the integrative phase of the next cycle. All of this is a lot easier than trying to remember these names and dates absent any context. I would recommend this book for that reason alone.</p>
<p>Second, I think this might give new context to Piketty on inequality. T&amp;N describe inequality as starting out very low during the growth phase of a secular cycle, rising to a peak during the stagflation phase, then dropping precipitously during the crisis. Piketty describes the same: inequality rising through the peaceful period of 1800 to 1900, dropping precipitously during the two World Wars, then gradually rising again since then. This doesn’t make a huge amount of sense, since I’m not sure you can fit the post industrial world into secular cycles. But I notice Piketty seems to think of this as a once-off event – inequality has been rising forever, broken only by the freak crisis of the two World Wars – and it’s interesting to read T&amp;N talk about the exact same process recurring again and again throughout history.</p>
<p>Finally, and most important: is there any sense in which this is still going on?</p>
<p>The easiest answer would be no, there isn’t. The secular cycles are based around Malthusian population growth, but we are now in a post-Malthusian regime where land is no longer the limiting resource. And the cycles seem to assume huge crises killing off 30% to 50% of the population, but those don’t happen anymore in First World countries; the Civil War was the bloodiest period of US history, and even it only killed 2% of Americans. Even Germany only lost about 15% of its population in World Wars I + II.</p>
<p>But Turchin has another book, <i>Ages Of Discord</i>, arguing that they do. I have bought it and started it and will report back when I’m done.</p>
<p>Even without a framework, this is just interesting to think about. In popular understanding of American history, you can trace out optimistic and pessimistic periods. The national narrative seems to include a story of the 1950s as a golden age of optimism. Then everyone got angry and violent in the early 1970s (the Status 451 review of <a href=""https://status451.com/2017/01/20/days-of-rage/"">Days Of Rage</a> is pretty great here, and reminds us that “people have completely forgotten that in 1972 we had over nineteen hundred domestic bombings in the United States”). Then everything suddenly got better once Reagan declared “morning in America” in the 1980s, with an era of optimism and good feelings lasting through the Clinton administration. Then things starting to turn bad sometime around Bush II. And now everybody hates each other, and fascists and antifa are fighting in the streets, and people are talking about how “civility” and “bipartisanship” are evil tools of oppression, and PredictIt says an avowed socialist has a 10% chance of becoming president of the US. To what extent is this narrative true? I don’t know, but it’s definitely the narrative.</p>
<p>One thing that strikes me about T&amp;N’s cycles is the ideological component. They describe how, during a growth phase, everyone is optimistic and patriotic, secure in the knowledge that there is enough for everybody. During the stagflation phase, inequality increases, but <i>concern about</i> inequality increases even more, zero-sum thinking predominates, and social trust craters (both because people are actually defecting, and because it’s in lots of people’s interest to play up the degree to which people are defecting). By the crisis phase, partisanship is much stronger than patriotism and radicals are talking openly about how violence is ethically obligatory.</p>
<p>And then, eventually, things get better. There is a new Augustan Age of virtue and the reestablishment of all good things. This is a really interesting claim. Western philosophy tends to think in terms of trends, not cycles. We see everything going on around us, and we think this is some endless trend towards more partisanship, more inequality, more hatred, and more state dysfunction.</p>
<p><i>Secular Cycles</i> offers a narrative where endless trends can end, and things can get better after all. Of course, it also offers a narrative where sometimes this process involves the death of 30% – 50% of the population. Maybe I should read Turchin’s other books before speculating any further.</p>

During training, we can write the loss function as a function of its weights and biases. In general, all of deep learning can be reduced notation-wise to simple multidimensional functions, and compositions of those simple functions.</p><p>Therefore, in order to understand deep learning, we must understand the multidimensional generalization of the derivative, the gradient. First, in order to construct the gradient, however, we must briefly consider the notion of <em>partial derivatives</em>. A quick aside, I have occasionally observed that some people seem at first confused by partial derivatives, imagining them to some type of fractional notion of calculus. <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""^4""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char""></span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sup"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: 0.513em; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mn"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">4</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p>Do not be alarmed. As long as you understand what a derivative is in one dimension, partial derivatives should be a piece of cake. A partial derivative is simply a derivative of a function with respect to a particular variable, <em>with all the other variables held constant</em>. To visualize, consider the following multidimensional function that I have ripped from Wikimedia. </p><span><figure><img src=""https://i.imgur.com/B6S3qL2.png"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:40%""></figure></span><p>Here, we are taking the partial derivative of the function with respect to <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""x""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">x</span></span></span></span></span></span> where <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""y""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.519em; padding-right: 0.006em;"">y</span></span></span></span></span></span> is held constant at <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""1""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mn""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">1</span></span></span></span></span></span> and the <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""z""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.003em;"">z</span></span></span></span></span></span> axis represents the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codomain"">co-domain</a> of the function (ie. the axis that is being mapped to). I think about partial derivatives in the same way as the image above, by imagining taking a slice of the function in the x-direction, and thereby reducing the function to one dimension, allowing us to take a derivative.

Whereas the single variable derivative provided us the slope of the function at a single point, the gradient provides us a vector which points in the direction of greatest ascent at a point and whose magnitude is equal to the rate of increase in this direction. Also, just as a derivative allows us to construct a local linear approximation of a function about a point, the gradient allows us to construct a linear approximation of a multivariate function about a point in the form of a hyperplane. From this notion of a gradient, we can ""descend"" down a loss function by repeatedly subtracting the gradient starting at some point, and in the process find neural networks which are better at doing their assigned tasks. </p><p>In deep learning we are often asked to take the gradient of a function <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""f:\mathbb{R}^{n \times m}\to\mathbb{R}""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.519em; padding-right: 0.06em;"">f</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.151em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">:</span></span><span class=""mjx-msubsup MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-texatom""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-ams-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">R</span></span></span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sup"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: 0.615em; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-texatom"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">n</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">×</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">m</span></span></span></span></span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">→</span></span><span class=""mjx-texatom MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-ams-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">R</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> (this notation is just saying that we are mapping from a space of matrices to the real number line).

In this case, we treat the gradient exactly as we did before, by collecting all of the partial derivatives. There is no difference, except in notation.</p><p>Some calculus students are not well acquainted with the proof for why the gradient points in the direction of greatest ascent. Since it is simply a list of partial derivatives, this fact may seem surprising. Nonetheless, this fact is what makes the gradient centrally important in deep learning, so it is therefore worth repeating here.</p><p>In order to see why the gradient points in the direction of steepest ascent, we first need a way of measuring the ascent in a particular direction.

This isn't yet completely clear to me, and it seems likely that at some point in the (hopefully near) future, someone will build a much clearer conceptual understanding, and I'll replace this with a link to that discussion. Until then, I want to talk about how mesa-optimizers are control systems built within selection systems, and why that poses significant additional concern for alignment.</p><h1>Mesa-Optimizers</h1><p>I claimed in the previous post that Mesa-optimizers are always control systems. The base optimization selects for a mesa-optimizer, usually via side-effect-free or low-cost sampling and/or simulation, then creates a system that does further optimization as an output. In some cases, the further optimization is direct optimization in the terms laid out in my earlier post, but in others it is control.</p><h2>Direct Mesa-Optimizers</h2><p>In many cases, the selection system finds optimal parameters or something similar for a direct optimization system. This is exactly the earlier example of building a guidance system for a rocket is an obvious class of example where selection leads to a direct optimizer. This isn't the only way that optimizers can interact, though.</p><p> I'd say that MCTS + Deep learning is an important example of this mix which <a href=""https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7120-thinking-fast-and-slow-with-deep-learning-and-tree-search.pdf"">has been compared to ""Thinking Fast and Slow""</a> (pdf, NIPS paper). In chess, for example, the thinking fast is the heuristic search to choose where to explore, which is based on a selection system, and the exploration is MCTS, which in this context I'm calling direct optimization. (This is despite the fact that it's obviously probabilistic, so in some respects looks like selection, because while the selection IS choosing points in the space, it isn't doing evaluation, but rather deterministic play-forward of alternative scenarios. The evaluation is being done by the heuristic evaluation system.) In that specific scenario, any misalignment is almost entirely a selection system issue - unless there was some actual mistake in the implementation of the rules of chess. </p><p>This opens up a significant concern for causal Goodhart; regime change will plausibly have particularly nasty effects. This is because the directly optimizing mesa-optimizer isn't at all able to consider whether the parameters selected by the base-optimizer should be reconsidered. And this is far worse for ""true"" control mesa-optimizers.</p><h2>Control Mesa-optimizers</h2><p>Before we talk more about failure modes, it's important to clarify two levels of failure; the base-optimizer can fail to achieve its goals because it designs a misaligned mesa-optimizer, and the mesa-optimizer itself can fail to achieve its goals. The two failure modes are different, because we don't have any reason to assume a-priori that our mesa-optimizer shares goals with our base optimizer. </p><p>Just like humans are adaptation-executioners, Mesa-optimizers are mesa-optimizers, not simply optimizers. If their adaptations are instead tested against the true goal, or at least the base-optimizers goal, then evaluated on that basis, they aren't mesa-optimizers, they are trials for the selection optimizer. Note that these two cases aren't necessarily incompatible; in something like Google's <a href=""https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/04/federated-learning-collaborative.html"">federated learning</a> model, the shared model is updated based on the control system's data. So self-driving cars may be mesa-optimizers using a neural net, and the data gathered is later used to update the base-optimizer model, which is then given back to the agents. The two parts of the system can therefore suffer different types of failures, but at least the post-hoc updating seems to plausibly reduce misalignment of the mesa-optimizer.</p><p>But in cases where side-effects occur, so that the control mesa-optimizer imposes externalities on the system, the mesa-optimizer typically won't share goals with the base optimizer! This is because if it shares goals exactly, the base optimization doesn't need to build a mesa-optimizer, it can run tests without ceding direct control. (Our self-driving cars in the previous paragraph are similar to this,  but their goal is the trained network's implicit goal, not the training objective used for the update. In such in a federated learning model, it can fail and the trial can be used for better learning the model.) On the other hand, if no side-effects occur and goals are shared, the difference is irrelevant; the mesa-optimizer can fail costlessly and start over.</p><h2>Failure of Mesa-optimizers as Principle-Agent-type ""Agents""</h2><p>There is a clear connection to principal-agent problems. (Unfortunately, the term agent is ambiguous, since we also want to discuss embedded agents. In this section, that's not what is being discussed.)  Mesa-optimizers can succeed at their goals but fail to be reliable agents, or they can fail even at their own goals. I'm unsure about this, but it seems each of these cases should be considered separately. Earlier, I noted that some Goodhart failures are model failures. With mesa-optimizers involved, there are two sets of models - the base optimizer model, and the mesa-optimizer model.</p><p>Principal optimization failures occur either if the mesa-optimiser itself falls prey to a Goodhart failure due to shared failures in the model, or if the mesa-optimizer model or goals are different than the principal's in ways that allow the metrics not to align with the principals' goals. (Abrams correctly noted in an earlier comment that this is misalignment. I'm not sure, but it seems this is principally a terminology issue.) </p><p>This second form allows a new set of failures. I'm even less sure about this next, but I'll suggest that we can usefully categorize the second class into 3 cases; mesa-superoptimizers, mesa-suboptimizers, and mesa-transoptimizers. The first, mesa-superoptimizers, is where the Mesa-optimizer is able to find clever ways to get around the (less intelligent) base optimizer's model. This allows all of the classic Goodhart's law-type failures, but they occur between the Mesa-optimizer and the based-optimizer, rather than between the human controller and the optimizer. This case includes the classic runaway superintelligence problems.  The second, mesa-suboptimizers, is where the mesa-optimizer uses a simpler model than the base optimizer, and hits a Goodhart failure that the base-optimizer could have avoided. (Let's say, for example, that it uses a correlational model holding certain factors known by the base optimizer to influence the system constant, and for whatever reason the mesa-optimizer enters a regime-change region, where those factors change in ways that the base-model understands.) Lastly, there are mesa-transoptimizers, where typical human types of principle-agent failures can occur because the mesa-optimizer has different goals. The other way this occurs is if the mesa-optimizer has access to or builds a different model than the base-optimzer. This is a bit different than mesa-superoptimizers, and it seems likely that there are a variety of cases in this last category. I'd suggest that it may be more like multi-agent failures than it is like a traditional superintelligence alignment problem.</p><h2>On to Embedded Agents</h2><p>I need to think further about the above, and should probably return to it, but for now I plan to make the (eventual) next post about embedded agency in this context. Backing up from the discussing on Mesa-optimizers, a key challenge for building safe optimizers in general is that control often involves embedded agent issues, where the model must be smaller than the system. In particular, in the case of mesa-optimizers, the base-optimizer needs to think of itself as an embedded agent whose model needs to include the mesa-optimizer's behavior, which is being chosen by the base-optimizer. This isn't quite embedded agency, but it requires the base optimizer to be ""larger"" than the mesa-optimizer, only allowing mesa-suboptimizers, which is unlikely to be guaranteed in general.</p>",Davidmanheim,davidmanheim,Davidmanheim,

<p>Suppose your friend tells you he's on a weight-loss program. What do you think will happen in three months if he keeps on the weight-loss program? Will he lose weight?</p>
<p>If you're like me, you're thinking, ""Of course. He is on a weight-loss program, isn't he? So, ipso facto, he is likely to lose weight.""</p>
<p>Does there seem to be anything fishy about that chain of reasoning?</p>
<p>We usually describe the current features of a thing and predict something about the future. For example, we might say ""I'm running for half an hour each day"" and predict that we will lose a certain number of pounds by the end of the month. But your friend above skipped the description and talked about the prediction as if it were visible right now: ""I'm on a weight-loss program"".</p>
<p>You weren't told the features of the activity (running for half an hour) or even a name (CrossFit program). If you had been told either, you could have judged it based on your past knowledge of those features or names. Running regularly does help you lose weight and so does CrossFit. But, here, you were told just the prediction itself. This means you can't predict anything for sure. If his program involves running, he will lose weight; if it involves eating large cheese pizzas, he won't. You don't know which it is.</p>
<p>Yet, it sounded quite convincing! Even if you objected by saying that your friend probably won't stick to the exercise regimen, you probably bought into the premise, like me, that the program <em>was</em> a weight-loss program.</p>
<p><strong>Hypothesis</strong>: If you are given an adjective that describes a future event and are not given any currently-visible features, then you're more likely to accept that that future event will occur than when you can see some features.</p>
<p>In other words, result-based descriptions make you less skeptical.</p>
<p>A more serious example is when someone mentions a drug-prevention program. We might assume that it will prevent illegal drugs from being bought and sold. After all, it must have been designed for that purpose. But the result depends on what the program actually does. Running ads saying ""Don't do drugs!"" may not achieve much, whereas inspecting trucks at border checkpoints may. To judge whether the program will be successful, you have to inspect its actual features. But ""drug-prevention program"" sounded convincing, right? Notice how the adjective ""drug-prevention"" describes a future event - it says that drugs will be prevented in the future. Now, since you can't look into the future and tell whether drugs were in fact prevented, you shouldn't accept such an adjective. And since you're not told anything else about the program, you really can't say anything either way. And yet it sounds so convincing!</p>
<p>Similarly, take environment-protection laws. Again, surely they must have been designed for the purpose of protecting the environment. Don't you feel like they will protect the environment? Contrast that to saying ""a law that raises the tax rate on fossil fuels"". Now this may or may not protect the environment in terms of air pollution, but at least you don't jump to that conclusion right away.</p>
<p>If this hypothesis is true, it means that the person who chooses the adjective can mislead you (and himself) in the direction he desires by describing the thing in terms of the result and by omitting any features.<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-ZGLEbTQsEAvzZ8Bzg-1"" id=""fnref-ZGLEbTQsEAvzZ8Bzg-1"">[1]</a></sup> Suppose someone tells you this is an earthquake-resistant building. Do you believe that it will withstand earthquakes better than ordinary buildings? I do. He may have described the thing solely in terms of the result, but it still sounded convincing, right? Contrast that to ""this building is made out of steel-reinforced concrete"". Now, you have one feature of the building. If you had to predict whether it would withstand earthquakes better than ordinary buildings, you would lean towards yes because reinforced concrete has worked in the past. But you wouldn't always jump to the conclusion that it was ""earthquake-resistant"". If I said ""this building is made out of green-colored brick"", you would be skeptical about its ability to withstand earthquakes better because you haven't heard anything about brick color being relevant.</p>
<p>The above illusion is compounded by the fact that you won't get feedback from others about your mistaken ideas if you use result-based descriptions<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-ZGLEbTQsEAvzZ8Bzg-2"" id=""fnref-ZGLEbTQsEAvzZ8Bzg-2"">[2]</a></sup>. Suppose your weight-loss friend assumed that using a telemarketed ab machine will help him get abs (it's right there in the name, I tell you!). Even then, he wouldn't have been lost if he had told you his concrete plan. You would have corrected his belief as soon as you stopped laughing at him. But since he told you that he's using a weight-loss program, you couldn't really correct him. He might go on behaving as if that silly ""ab machine"" is going to get him six-pack abs by summer.</p>
<p>Why do we even accept descriptions that have nothing except a description about the future?</p>
<p>For one, it matters that no features are described. If I said that I was drinking lemonade, you wouldn't really predict that I would lose weight. You would ask me what evidence I have for lemonade causing weight-loss. But what if I said I was having a weight-loss drink? You might be less skeptical as long as you didn't look at my glass. Who knows; maybe there are drinks out there that cause weight-loss.</p>
<p>Another relevant factor is <s>the speaker's credibility</s> how often we think the speaker sees the underlying features along with the eventual result. We accept an expert's result-based description because we trust that he knows the features that lead to the result and is just omitting them when talking to a layman. When a doctor says that these are ""sleeping pills"", we are more likely to accept it than when a school boy does - the doctor knows that the pills contain benzodiazepine, which usually works. When a politician calls something a ""drug-prevention program"", we are more likely to accept it than when a housewife says it - the politician knows that border-checks (or whatever) have worked in the past. However, this might be misleading when the expert is dealing with something novel, such as a brand-new pill formula or a brand-new approach to drug regulations, since he is unlikely to have seen the result of those features (or may not care very much about deceiving the voters).</p>
<p>Finally, such descriptions might be fine when talking about the past. Saying that ""I went on a weight-loss program and lost 50 pounds"" is a bit redundant, but harmless. You actually observe the result there, so you can decide based on the result how skeptical to be. You won't blindly jump to the conclusion that it will work as when someone says ""I'm on a weight-loss program right now"".</p>
<p>So, we should avoid describing something only in terms of the result and should describe it using features instead. And if anyone tries to bias our prediction by sneaking in an adjective from the future, we should stop and ask for the features.</p>
<h1>Examples of Adjectives from the Future</h1>
<p>Here are some result-based descriptions that I collected from news reports and books as I was testing the above hypothesis. All of them talk about future results, completely omit current features, and seem to make us less skeptical about the plan's success. Did you fall for any of them?</p>
<hr>
<p>Rehabilitation program -- Don't you feel like the drug addict is likely to get better after going to the rehab program? It's right there in the name! Notice that there are no features mentioned, just a description of the future as though it were the present. Contrast that to ""not having access to drugs for 30 days, listening to lectures, and talking about your experiences"". This doesn't make us jump to the conclusion that the addict will get better. We might even be skeptical about the power of lectures to fight off the temptation of drugs. For a real-world contrast, think of ""the 12-step program"". It too tries to overcome addiction, but it is described in terms of the features (12 steps), not the desired result (overcoming addiction). In fact, it sounds like work, which it probably is. A rehabilitation program doesn't quite sound like that.</p>
<p>Peace process -- Feels like it is likely to lead to peace. No features; only desired results. Contrast that to ""shaking hands and signing agreements in front of the world press"". We may be more skeptical that that will prevent future wars. But in the former case, we would be insulated from feedback because we keep talking about the ""peace process"" instead of the ""hand-shaking and agreement-signing"".</p>
<p>Wait. Aren't there people who distrust the peace process and talk about its possible failure? I suspect that they do so after mentioning features of the process. They might say that this dictator has reneged on his promises in the past and thus should not be trusted right now. It would sound ludicrous if they expressed skepticism without any features. People would ask, ""What do you mean this peace process may not bring about peace? It's a peace process.""</p>
<p>Dangerous driving -- Doesn't it seem likely that the driver is going to get into trouble? No features; no feedback; only the future result - danger. Contrast that to: one-handed driving, texting while driving, or overtaking cars by switching lanes. We are a bit more skeptical that it will cause danger.</p>
<p>Cost-cutting measures -- Need I say anything? Of course the cost-cutting measure is going to cut costs. Why else would they have called it a cost-cutting measure? Contrast that to ""switching to online advertising"" or ""encouraging working from home a few days a week"", which we are more skeptical about, since they may or may not bring down ultimate costs.</p>
<p>Healthy morning drink -- No features, but it sounds like it will lead to health. Even the ""morning"" part is not a description of a feature of the object. It just talks about the time when people will drink it. Contrast to: drink containing 15g of protein and other stuff, which may or may not lead to more ""health"".</p>
<p>Recidivism-reduction classes for ex-convicts, i.e., making sure they don't go back to jail after getting out -- Again, we feel like these classes will make them less likely to go back in. The classes reduce recidivism, after all. No features mentioned; description in terms of the future result (recidivism-reduction); insulated from feedback. Contrast that to ""lectures and reading books and stuff"". We might be much more skeptical.</p>
<p>You can find any number of examples like these: national security bill vs a bill that increases the number of fighter jets; sufficiently well-funded program vs same budget as last year (which may not be enough this year); a Sudoku-solving program vs program that solved a set of easy and medium Sudoku puzzles.</p>
<h1>How does this apply to LessWrong?</h1>
<p>Now, let's look at some descriptions that may be important to us as LessWrong readers.</p>
<p><strong>Effective altruism</strong> -- Doesn't effective altruism feel like it will be effective? And altruistic? I feel inclined to believe so. But the name talks about the future results and doesn't mention any current features. Contrast that to ""cash transfers"" or even ""evidence-based donations"" and ""evidence-based job changes"", which talk about currently-available evidence, not future results. We may be more skeptical that such cash transfers or donations will be effective or even altruistic. ""Cause prioritization"" talks about a feature of the process right now. We can see a clear gap between the causes we prioritize and their eventual effectiveness. That gap doesn't even seem to exist when we talk about effective altruism.</p>
<p>When I hear ""Against Malaria Foundation"", I feel like it is likely to strike a blow against malaria. All it needs is the money. But if I were to hear ""Mosquito Net Distributors"", I would ask quite a few questions about the effectiveness of mosquito nets. I may indeed get convinced that a dollar spent on nets will go farther than on other methods to fight malaria, but I won't jump to that conclusion. I may even think of how it might backfire or how mosquitoes might adapt. Not so with ""Against Malaria Foundation"".</p>
<p>Notice how future-based adjectives could make a cause immune to feedback. If you were to mention that you won't donate to, say, AMF, people could raise their eyebrows, ""Are you seriously <em>against</em> fighting against malaria?"". But if you mention the means, you can safely say that you are in favour of fighting malaria, but against focusing on mosquito nets.</p>
<p>Finally, if ""Mosquito Net Distributors"" sounds a bit too sober because it doesn't mention its purpose, perhaps we could combine the two as ""Mosquito Nets to Fight Malaria"". <sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-ZGLEbTQsEAvzZ8Bzg-3"" id=""fnref-ZGLEbTQsEAvzZ8Bzg-3"">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Rationality techniques</strong> -- When I <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/teaxCFgtmCQ3E9fy8/the-martial-art-of-rationality"">see</a> the term ""rationality technique"" or ""rationality training"" or ""methods of rationality"", I feel like the technique will lead to good, if not optimal, results. It doesn't describe any features after all; it just promises that good things will happen in the future. Contrast that to experimentation techniques or logical deduction. These talk about the features of the process and I don't assume that these will always get me the best results, since I know I might miss a confounding variable or apply rules incorrectly. I'm not quite as skeptical when I hear about the ""methods of rationality"".</p>
<p>Even when I look at concrete technique names, hearing about the CFAR technique of ""Comfort Zone Expansion (<a href=""https://rationality.org/workshops/sample-schedule"">CoZE</a>)"" makes me feel like it will actually expand my ""comfort zone"". But it doesn't mention any features; just the desired future result. Contrast that to ""doing for an hour, in public, a few things you avoided doing in the past"". Now, I pause when I ask myself if it will help me do what you or I may actually care about: ask a boss for a raise, tell an annoying colleague to shove it, or ask out a crush. I can tell that there is quite a gap between lying down on the pavement for 30 seconds and doing something that might jeopardize my work life. But when I hear ""Comfort Zone Expansion"", I really do feel like my ""comfort zone"" will be expanded, meaning that I will do those kinds of things more frequently. Why not call it ""uncomfortable-action practice"" or the original ""exposure therapy""?</p>
<p><strong>Brain emulation</strong> or brain-emulating software -- ""How sure are you that brain emulations would be conscious?"" (<a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6nbuf6ZDiQe5RWwqv/how-sure-are-you-that-brain-emulations-would-be-conscious"">source</a>)</p>
<p>My immediate response is that, of course, brain emulations would be conscious. If human brains are conscious (whatever that means) and if human brain emulations emulate human brains, then those would also be conscious. The very term seems to dispose me to a particular answer. It doesn't describe any present features, just the desired future results - that the program will behave like a human brain in most respects.</p>
<p>Imagine if we used a term that talked only about whichever observable tests you want: ""How sure are you that, say, a DARPA Grand Challenge-winning program would be conscious?"" Suddenly, we are given two separate variables and asked to bridge the gap between them. That gives us a lot more room for skepticism. We can see that there could be many a slip between its present features and its future results.</p>
<p>I reason just as naively about <a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Whole_brain_emulation"">claims</a> like whole brain emulation can be ""an easy way to create intelligent computers"" or will acquire the ""information contained within a brain"", since human brains are already intelligent and already contain information. Given that this is a field where no one has succeeded, i.e., no one has emulated a human brain, we should take pains to avoid terms that make us less skeptical.</p>
<p><strong>Optimization power</strong> -- Lastly, take <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CW6HDvodPpNe38Cry/aiming-at-the-target"">this</a> description of a car design: ""To hit such a tiny target in configuration space requires a powerful optimization process. The better the car you want, the more optimization pressure you have to exert - though you need a huge optimization pressure just to get a car at all.""</p>
<p>I find myself agreeing with that. A car that travels fast is highly-optimized, so of course it would need a powerful optimization process.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, ""optimization process"" does not describe any present features of the process itself. It simply says that the future result will be optimized. So, if you want something highly-optimized, you'd better find a powerful optimizer. Seems to make sense even though it's a null statement! But if you describe any features, as in ""the design of a car requires 1 teraflop of computing power for simulation"", I immediately ask, is that too little computing power? Too much? I become a lot more skeptical.</p>
<p>Again, this suggests that, in such a novel domain, we should be more careful about avoiding result-based descriptions like ""optimization power"", ""superintelligence"", and ""self-improving AI"".</p>
<h1>Should we always avoid Result-Based Descriptions?</h1>
<p>No. I don't think it's possible and I don't think people would want it. Like I said above, when I go to the doctor, I may just want ""sleeping pills"", not ""benzodiazepine"". Speaking about the latter would be a waste of time for the doctor and for me, <em>provided I trust him</em>. But what if I don't trust the person or if he's deluded himself?</p>
<p>I would reserve this technique for occasions when you're accepting <s>an important pitch</s> a pitch that asks for a big investment, either in business or politics or social circumstances. People may try to convince us to accept a ""career-defining opportunity"" (instead of a shift to another department, which may not define your career) or a ""jobs-for-the-poor program"" (instead of a law that reserves X% of infrastructure jobs, which may not be filled and may not employ all the poor) or a ""life-changing experience"" (instead of skydiving for six minutes, which may or may not change your life much).</p>
<p>When it comes to our own usage, as people who want to portray an accurate map of reality, we should avoid using such result-based descriptions that might mislead others and, most importantly, ourselves. Marketing may demand a title that sounds catchy, but you have to decide whether you want to risk deceiving others, especially when you're pitching an idea that will ask them to invest a lot.</p>
<p>What's in a name? Isn't it ok to have the name based on the result as long as the contents tell you the features? Well, that would be ok if people always mentioned the contents. But we usually omit the contents when referring to something and someone who is new or busy may not look at the contents. Thus they (and we) might get misled into predicting the result based on the title. A person donating to an organization or paying for a workshop may see only the title, perhaps a few testimonials from friends, and maybe some headings on the website. If all of these descriptions are result-based, he might think that the organization or workshop does, in fact, have a good chance of delivering those results. If he had been given the features, maybe he would have been much more skeptical.</p>
<hr>
<p>Let me know your thoughts below. Does the basic hypothesis seem valid? What about some of its implications?</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong>:  Made it clearer that I'm claiming result-based descriptions make you less skeptical, not that they convince you absolutely.</p>

This is not that surprising: your email is basically a to-do list where other people (and companies) can add items for free, without asking; and where you’re the only one who can remove them. We should do something about this. </p><p>More broadly, <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ENBzEkoyvdakz4w5d/out-to-get-you"">the attention economy seems broken</a></u>. Recognising this, many rationalists <u><a href=""https://fragile-credences.github.io/facebook/"">use various software tools to protect themselves from apps that are engineered to be addictive</a></u>. This helps at an individual level, but it doesn’t help solve the collective action problem of how to allocate our attention as a community. We should do something about this. </p><p><strong>Costly signalling and avoiding information asymmetries</strong></p><p>An “information asymmetry” is situation where someone has true information which they are unable to communicate. For example, suppose 10 economists are trying to influence government policy on issue X, and one of them actually, really knows what the most effective thing is. Yet, they might not be able to communicate this to the decision-makers, since the remaining 9 have degrees from equally prestigious institutions and arguments that sound equally rigorous to someone without formal training in economics. <u><a href=""https://equilibriabook.com/molochs-toolbox/"">Information asymmetries are a key mechanism that generate bad equilibria. </a></u></p><p>When it comes to email, this might look as follows: Lots of people write to senior researchers asking for feedback on papers or ideas, yet they’re mostly crackpots or uninteresting, so most stuff is not worth reading. A promising young researcher without many connections would want their feedback (and the senior researcher would want to give it!), but it simply takes too much effort to figure out that the paper is promising, so it never gets read. In fact, <em>expecting this</em>, the junior researcher might not even send it in the first place</p><p>This could be avoided if people who genuinely believed their stuff was important could pay some money as <em>a costly signal </em>of this fact. Actual crackpots could of course also pay up, but 1) they might be less likely to, and 2) the payment would offset some of the cost of the recipient figuring out whether the email is important or not. </p><p><strong>How the signalling problem is currently solved, and why that’s bad</strong></p><p>Currently, the signalling problem is solved by things like: </p><ul><li>Spending lots of effort crafting interesting-sounding intros which signal that the thing is worth reading, instead of <em>just getting to the point</em></li><li>Burning social capital -- adding tags like “[Urgent]” or “[Important]” to the subject line </li></ul><p>This is bad, because: </p><p>1) It’s a slippery slope to a really bad equilibrium. I’ve gotten emails with titles like “Jacob, is everything alright between us?” because I didn’t buy a water bottle from some company. This is what we should expect when companies fight for my attention without any way to just directly pay for it. Even within the rationality community, if our only way of allocating importance is by drawing upon very serious vocabulary, we’ll create an incentive for exaggeration, <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/PrCmeuBPC4XLDQz8C/unconscious-economies"">differentially favouring those less scrupulous about this practice</a></u>, and chip away at our ability to use shared-cues-of-importance <em>when it really matters</em>.</p><p>2) The main thing protecting us from this inside a smaller community is that people want to preserve their reputations. But if you’re unsure how important your thing is, and mislabeling it means potentially crying-wolf and risking your reputation, this usually makes it more worth it to just avoid the tag. Which means that we lose out on all those times when your thing actually was important and using the tag would have communicated that. </p><p>3) It puts the recipient between a rock and a hard place, and they’re not being compensated for it. If you mark something as “[Urgent]” that actually is urgent, and the person responds and does what you want, you’ve still presented them with the choice between sacrificing some ability to freely prioritise their tasks, and sacrificing some part of the quality of your relationship. There should be some easy way for you to compensate them for that. </p><p>4) It’s way too coarse-grained. There’s not really any way of saying:</p><p>“This is kinda important, but not that urgent, though it would probably be good if you read it at some point, though that depends on what else is on your plate”</p><p>apart from writing exactly that -- but then you’re making a <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xqJqZgowy5pPxNNst/inconvenience-is-qualitatively-bad"">complicated cognitive demand</a></u>, which has already burnt lots of attention for the recipient. </p><h3>Brief FAQ</h3><p><strong>What if replacing email with paid emails puts us in another equilibrium that’s bad for unexpected reasons?</strong></p><p>At the moment, it doesn’t seem feasible for us to use this to <em>replace</em> email. There isn’t even software available for doing that completely. Rather, people would consent to receiving paid messages (for example via earn.com, see below) <em>in addition to</em> having their regular inbox.</p><p><strong>What if people don’t have enough money?</strong></p><p>As mentioned above, sending standard emails are still an option. Yet this becomes a problem in the world where we move to the equilibrium where a standard email is taken to signal “I didn’t pay for this, so it’s not that important”. Then I can imagine grants for “email costs” being a thing, or that the benefits of the new equilibrium outweigh this cost, or that they don’t. I’m uncertain.   </p><p><strong>Wouldn’t this waste a lot of money?</strong></p><p>Not really, assuming that the people who you send money to are at least as effective at spending it as you are, which seems likely if this gets used within the rationality community.</p><h3>If this is basically right: then what do we do?</h3><p>Earn.com is a site which offers paid emails. For example, you can pay to message me at <u><a href=""http://earn.com/jacobjacob/"">earn.com/jacobjacob</a></u>/ EDIT: <em>note that payment is conditional on actually getting a reply.</em></p><p>If this seems like something that could solve the current email mess, we should coordinate to get a critical mass of the community to sign-up, and make their profile url:s available. (Compare this to how we’ve previously started using things <u><a href=""http://reciprocity.io/"">reciprocity.io</a></u> and <u><a href=""https://calendly.com/"">Calendly</a></u>.)</p><p>I’d be happy to coordinate such a campaign, but I don’t want to do it until I’m more confident it would be a good thing. </p><p>(For the record, I have no relation to earn.com and would not benefit personally by others joining, beyond the obvious positive effects on the community. They simply seem like the best available option for doing this. They have a pretty solid team, and are used by some very senior VCs like Marc Andreessen and Keith Rabois.) </p>",jacobjacob,bird-concept,Bird Concept,

Homosexual orientation is very rare. There’s one species, domestic sheep, in which 8-10% of rams are not interested in ewes at all. You can tie a ewe in heat in front of them and they don’t react at all. Actually, one area where homosexuality research has flourished is among sheep breeders because if you buy one of these rams who’s gay, <a href=""https://www.fwi.co.uk/farm-life/1-in-12-rams-are-gay-and-costing-farmers-says-breeder"">that’s really bad news</a> for the business.</p><p>So homosexual orientation is exceedingly rare. Even though you see stats that it’s 10% in people, it’s about 3%. <a href=""https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/cb1e47_2914fac5806e4843a8544c1cdee5a69a.pdf"">In a paper that I wrote</a> I claim that bisexuality is the optimal sexual strategy because sex is not just used for reproduction, it’s also used for affiliation. There are a number of ways to affiliate: you can give somebody food or you can give somebody an orgasm. These are ways to get other people to like you. If you’re somewhat attracted to people of the same sex but not enough to forego reproductive opportunities with people of the opposite sex, then you can actually engage with both sexes.</p><p><strong>Is the bisexual revolution coming?</strong></p><p>Diana: There are places where people are much more open to it, but not many places. It’s a whole spectrum of behavior.</p><p>In places around the world, there are men who have anything from affectionate to sexual interactions with other men and they’re not considered gay. They have homosexual behavior along with heterosexual behavior, and that’s a common thing. If you look at the bell curve of orientation in a society that suppresses homosexual behavior among men, you’ll find that only men who are predominantly homosexual will exhibit this type of behavior. It’s not used for affiliation in our particular society, so men don’t engage in it. Homosexual men are basically just the edge of this bell curve. The reason there keep being a small percentage of men who are exclusively homosexual is because bisexuality is adaptive.</p><p>The most controversial hypothesis about the origin of homosexuality is Gregory Cochran’s idea though there’s not much evidence behind it, which is the ‘gay germ’ hypothesis. Now homosexuality is not as hereditary as you may think; if one identical twin is gay his twin would be gay only 50% of the time. But also, identical twins are usually in the same amniotic sac, while fraternal twins are in different amniotic sacs. Cochran shares some evidence that if twins share an amniotic sac, they are more likely to both be gay. So there might be some virus or bacteria that causes homosexuality later in life.</p><p>That’s very controversial because the idea is that there would then be some kind of gay vaccine which could prevent women from giving birth to boys who would grow up to be gay. </p><p>Geoffrey: And the reason why it would make sense from the point of view of the virus is that it’s a lot easier to spread since gay men have a lot more sexual partners on average than straight men. </p><p>I have a Ph.D. student studying generally whether sexually transmitted pathogens evolve to manipulate our sexual behavior to promote their spread. This could include lowering our mating standards, making us more promiscuous, more sexual, being sexually active earlier and later in life, all kinds of things. So it might not be us in the driver’s seat as much as we think. </p><p>Diana: There are also ideas about endocrine disruptors and things of that nature. This is all very controversial. I was at a conference with other people, like me, who study homosexuality. And there was a guy there who wasn’t willing to admit that gay men are more feminine than straight men on average, that they’re more likely on average to have feminine interests. And if there’s controversy about something as basic as that, it’s very difficult to talk about anything in this sphere. </p><p>Or, for example, if you give a female rat testosterone while she’s in the womb she’s going to mount other rats when she’s older. And in the 1980s some women took a miscarriage drug that masculinized their daughters and made them more likely to be lesbians. That kind of stuff happens as well and people really hate talking about it.</p><p><strong>Is there quantified data on gay men being more promiscuous?</strong></p><p>Geoffrey: There are some studies about the average number of sexual partners, the typical results are that sexually active gay men in their 30s or 40s have had <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3334840/"">several dozen partners</a>, while the average for straight men is closer to 10. The average for women is closer to 10 but they may be lying. And it’s lower for lesbians than for straight women.</p><p>But there’s a bit of a taboo around mentioning these results because promiscuity is heavily moralized. Polyamorous people also tend to have more partners than monogamous people. And then conservatives say that poly people are all sluts. Now we are, but in a good way! </p><p><strong>Why do men not have a preference for tall women? Women prefer tall men, and tall women have tall children, some of whom will be sons. So it’s weird that tall women aren’t universally preferred.</strong></p><p>Diana: Dutch people are tall and people in Spain and Portugal are short, and there’s evidence that it’s not by accident. There is mixed evidence that there has actually been positive selection for shortness in Portugal and Spain (which is why I’m short). There’s evidence from across the world that men prefer smaller women. Some of that has to do with smallness being associated with youth and neoteny, some of that might have to do with less savory hypotheses about exploitability and controllability. </p><p>It’s probably also associated with fertility. I think that <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Thornhill"">Randy Thornhill</a> said that 5’2” is the optimal height for fertility. Women parlay some of the somatic effort of growing into reproductive effort.</p><p>Jacob: In ancient Greece, men preferred tall women. In <em>The Odyssey</em>, Calypso is bewildered that Odysseus wants to go back home since she’s taller than Penelope. And Odysseus admits that she’s taller and more beautiful, but says that he’s still loyal to his family even though they aren’t tall like the gods.</p><p><strong>You said earlier that it’s important for people to be conscious of their motivations, and I’ve recently heard two criticisms of that idea. One is Robin Hanson’s idea that if you know your motivations, you’re worse at doing something and convincing people that you’re doing it for the right reasons. The more interesting one is Jonathan Haidt’s idea of divinity, the moral dimension that puts animals below you and the gods above you. The less like an animal you are the more you can make meaning out of your life, or act morally and communally.</strong></p><p><strong>Do you think that thinking about motivations like trying to get laid takes away from that?</strong></p><p>Diana: To Robin Hanson’s view, it’s an interesting idea that you’re worse at things if you know the motivations. But I can also make myself happier if I’m aware of what’s driving me. I used to date an Effective Altruist who made a lot less money than I did. At the beginning of an evening, I would give him cash so that he could pay for everything through the course of the night. And I would try my best and often succeed in forgetting I had given him cash so that I would feel like he’s taking me out. And that was awesome, but it required being quite cynical about my motivations.</p><p>As for Jonathan Haidt, I don’t identify with that notion at all. I can feel very much that I have higher meaning and purposes in my life and still be a mammal, a shitting, gestating, weird <em>body</em>.</p><p><strong>I’m curious why you consider altruism a positive signal. I’m asking because I have no morals and no principles and I’m living a very happy life. Potentially the happiest life I could imagine living. Why is altruism so appealing to other people? To me, it seems inefficient.</strong></p><p>Diana: Ok, I’m going to talk to you like you’re an alien. </p><p><strong>That’s right, I’m an alien.</strong></p><p>Diana: Let’s say you’re in a small group and you want people to exchange with you. You need to signal certain qualities to them that mean that in the long term you’re a good exchange partner. One of those would be loyalty to the group; another is consistency over time. This is very interesting: people change a lot over time but they like to signal that they’re very consistent so they’ll be reliable partners in the future. Altruism signals that you’re willing to be generous to those who are powerless. That is a good and virtuous signal because it also means that you’re a better exchange partner. If someone’s down and out and no longer useful to you, for example, you would still be willing to help them out. </p><p>Geoffrey: I have a whole chapter on this in <em>The Mating Mind</em>, <a href=""https://putanumonit.com/2019/07/08/diana-fleischman-and-geoffrey-miller-interview/#read"">which Diana should read some time</a> *grins*. What I argue there is: imagine that you have two tribes. In one, you signal traits in ways that don’t bring benefit to others, like showing off only by singing which doesn’t bring evolutionary benefits like food or protection to the group. In the second tribe you’re doing cooperative hunting, for example, and bringing back tens of thousands of calories in mammoth meat and distributing it conspicuously within the tribe. Which of these tribes is going to do better in competition?</p><p>Jacob: Depends. Is the competition <em>American Idol</em>?</p><p>Geoffrey: The concept is that we’re descended from the second tribe. We’re descended from many generations of ancestors that signaled altruism within the group and had these exchange partner benefits within the group but also had net benefits in competition with other groups.</p><p>This is not a strict group selection argument, it’s an equilibrium selection argument in the game-theoretic sense. That’s what I argued in <em>The Mating Mind</em>, that we’re an unusually altruistic species because at the tribe v. tribe level the cooperative altruistic signalers did better. And in fact, that was exactly what Darwin argued in 1871. </p><p><strong>Given evolutionary accounts of relationship activities and strategies, the cynical approach tends to have a moralizing effect. Calling what women do ‘shit-testing’ makes it sound like a morally bad thing to do to your partner. But of course, a lot of what we’re doing is good: it strengthens bonds, creates a sense of security, etc. </strong></p><p><strong>I wonder, in your personal life or from an academic perspective, how do you choose when to indulge your evolutionary preferences and when not to?</strong></p><p>Diana: I don’t have as much control as people may think. I’m very aware when I’m shit-testing, and Geoffrey will say as much to me, but I still carry on. I can also predict how long I’ll be feeling angry and how long I might feel like shit testing.  </p><p>Yes, calling it that makes it sound bad because it generally is bad, not just because it’s a red pill term. When I was shit-testing today I recognized that I was taking the thing that he had done most recently as an indicator of his overall commitment rather than aggregating. It’s much easier for a woman to aggregate all of her grievances than to aggregate all of her joys. It’s because of this <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_management_theory"">error management</a>, it’s much better to err on the side of being <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_management_theory#Skeptical_commitment_bias"">doubtful about somebody’s commitment</a>. It can be good to play around with these emotions, but it’s hard to handle them.</p><p>Geoffrey: It might be better to use a more neutral term. Amotz Zahavi called it ‘testing the bond’ in his 1975 book <em>The Handicap Principle. </em></p><p><strong>You mentioned giving a talk about how kink spaces are outlets for evolutionary urges. How would kink be represented in days of yore?</strong></p><p>Geoffrey: There are carved images that look like the Venus of Willendorf fertility figures that have indications of rope and bondage going back at least 30,000 years. It’s hard to interpret, but tying women up is what you would do when you raid another village to kill all the men and steal the women. </p><p>Domination/submission dynamics run really deep in primates, generally. Primates have been doing domination and submission signals for at least 60-70 million years. The idea of engineering situations that bring that out seems like a natural thing for social primates to do. </p><p>And as for role play, kids like to pretend to be someone they’re not. And sensation play like spanking and flogging… there’s a speculative theory.</p><p>The standard form of copulation for mammals is dorso-ventral rear entry — ‘doggy style’. What that tends to do is put a lot of repeated impact on the female’s back end. So, what you’re getting with flogging is a superstimulus of prolonged extra-hard copulation. It’s a fitness indicator because that would be hard for a male to sustain. </p><p>Diana: There’s another thing about kink, which is that when you’re aroused you have arousal-induced analgesia — you don’t experience pain as much. If you can take a lot of pain, you’re actually giving an honest signal of how aroused you are. </p><p>The top three sexual fantasies for women are: number one, having sex with their main partner *mimes yawning*, number two, sex with a strange man, and number three, being taken against their will, which is now called “rapture play”. So these are things that women have experienced over evolutionary history many, many times. It’s a controversial thing to talk about but if you look at any romance novel there are often interactions where women are taken against their will. </p><p>Geoffrey: I did give a talk in Amsterdam on the evolutionary psychology of BDSM and kink. What I pointed out there is that a lot of what happens in kink in playing around and ritualizing a lot of evolutionary psychology stuff. Likewise, a lot of what happens in role-play — letting those instincts out to play. And that can be wonderful and creative and really really good for a relationship.</p><p>I don’t know how many other ev psych people have this view, we don’t really talk about it at the <a href=""https://www.hbes.com/"">HBES conference</a>. I do think that in the future there will be more openness about it. There will be a view that we can keep these dark instinctual secrets when we go out to our corporate jobs and behave in society, but you can still make space for them to come out and play in private life in safe and creative ways.</p><p><strong>While we’re on the subject of kink and strange desires, I found that I have a desire as a woman that makes no evolutionary sense at all. I wonder if you have a theory about it. I have a fantasy about finding a shitty loser that no one likes and have him dominate me. </strong></p><p>Diana: So utilitarian! But would he even know how? It’s actually a very utilitarian activity to have sex with all the men that no one else will have sex with. It would make their year!</p><p>Geoffrey: Normally hypergamy works a little differently. Normally a woman would take an existing partner and do some mental trick or role-play to build him up as a kind of superhero. So the status differential between them gets amplified until she feels like Leda and the swan (who’s actually Zeus) and that’s exciting. Taking a total loser and then pushing yourself way below him… I don’t get at all. </p><p>Diana: I’ll just make up a story here. You want to find someone that no one else wants, so you have no competition for him, and then elicit in him the highest status and accomplishment he can have. So you have an ideal situation where you can totally monopolize him because no one else has an idea that he’s good. Women often choose men based on how many other women are attracted to them, but if you choose somebody that you have special knowledge about you never have to share them with anybody. </p><p>Geoffrey: I have an idea. If you’re a teenage girl in an age-stratified school system where you’re only allowed to date and interact with guys your age, they’re all losers relative to actual mature adults. So in order to feel any attraction to these guys you have to be able to see the little bit of promise and potential in them and be able to feel the hypergamy by making yourself even lower than they are. That would be adaptive if that’s all the choice you’ve got available. </p><p>So I think that some women are in a position where the best they can do in terms of finding a partner that they think is a catch, given the constraints that you’re all in 9th grade.</p>",Jacobian,jacob-falkovich,Jacob Falkovich,

Then we offer it to exchange C+$1 for B, then B+$1 for A, and finally A+$1 for C. Now the agent paid $3 and ended up where it started.</p><p>The assumption here is that not only does this agent prefer A to B, it prefers A to B+$1. Of course, the price of $1 could be too steep, then we could look for something less valuable to exchange.</p><p>However, payments of arbitrarily low value need not exist! Sure, you can propose a lottery, where the agent only has to pay 1$ with probability <em>p</em>. But arbitrarily low probabilities need not exist. To offer a lottery, you need to have a physical method to generate events with that probability. If <em>p</em> equals 1 divided by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham%27s_number"">Grahm&#x27;s number</a>, how many coins would you have to flip to run this lottery? Even if you said <em>&quot;the agent will pay $1 when a lump of solid gold materializes out of thin air&quot;</em>, there are numbers lower than that probability. I hate to be an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrafinitism"">ultrafinitist</a>, but it&#x27;s true, extremely small (or large) numbers are not physically meaningful.</p><p>Note, here I am assuming the axiom of continuity, i.e. that if B&lt;A&lt;B+$1, then for some <em>p</em>, we must have B+<em>p</em>·$1&lt;A. However, we should be able to violate this axiom as well.</p><p>What does this imply? Probably nothing. This perverse agent is almost indistinguishable from an agent which sets U(A)=U(B)=U(C). The rule is that you can violate any axioms, but only when it doesn&#x27;t matter.</p>",zulupineapple,zulupineapple,zulupineapple,

We have seen an easy way to check whether it can be extended to a categorical preference, and a simple description of all the resulting possible categorical preferences. A categorical preference always comes from a utility function, in a way which is unique up to translation and scaling. </p><p>In actual practise, it is not unlikely that the weak preference data will not come from a categorical preference (and thus not from a utility function). Then we should probably look for the `most reasonable' associated categorical preference, how to do this is not so clear to me yet. </p><p>I find the fact that utility functions are only unique up to translation and scaling a bit awkward; maybe this notion of categorical preference captures the important data in a more canonical fashion?! </p>",DavidHolmes,davidholmes,DavidHolmes,

I suspect much of what I wrote below is false. </em></p><p>Without taking proper care of a very deep neural network, gradients tend to suddenly become quite large or quite small. If the gradient is too large, then the network parameters will be thrown completely off, possibly causing them to become NaN. If they are too small, then the network will stop training entirely. This problem is called the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanishing_gradient_problem"">vanishing and exploding gradients problem</a>.</p><p>When I first learned about the vanishing gradients problem, I ended up getting a vague sense of why it occurs. In my head I visualized the sigmoid function.</p><span><figure><img src=""https://i.imgur.com/kEN83lY.png"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:40%"" /></figure></span><p>I then imagined this being applied element-wise to an affine transformation. If we just look at one element, then we can imagine it being the result of a dot product of some parameters, and that number is being plugged in on the x-axis. On the far left and on the far right, the derivative of this function is very small. This means that if we take the partial derivative with respect to some parameter, it will end up being extremely (perhaps vanishingly) small.<span><style>.mjx-chtml {display: inline-block; line-height: 0; text-indent: 0; text-align: left; text-transform: none; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 100%; font-size-adjust: none; letter-spacing: normal; word-wrap: normal; word-spacing: normal; white-space: nowrap; float: none; direction: ltr; max-width: none; max-height: none; min-width: 0; min-height: 0; border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 1px 0}

There are a few mistakes I made:</p><p>1. This picture doesn&#x27;t tell me anything about why the gradient &quot;vanishes.&quot; It&#x27;s just showing me a picture of where the gradients get small. Gradients also get small when they reach a local minimum. Does this mean that vanishing gradients are sometimes good?</p><p>2. I knew that gradient vanishing had something to do with the depth of a network, but I didn&#x27;t see how the network being deep affected why the gradients got small. I had a rudimentary sense that each layer of sigmoid compounds the problem until there&#x27;s no gradient left, but this was never presented to me in a precise way, so I just ignored it. </p><p>I now think I understand the problem a bit better, but maybe not a whole lot better.</p><p>(Note: I have gathered evidence that the vanishing gradient problem is not linked to sigmoids and put it in <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/mdpyzdx9hMsjf9AKv/why-gradients-vanish-and-explode#tnSxTKKdRiHXkrhgc"">this comment</a>. I will be glad to see evidence which proves I&#x27;m wrong on this one, but I currently believe this is evidence that machine learning professors are teaching it incorrectly).</p><p>First, the basics. Without describing the problem in a very general sense, I&#x27;ll walk through a brief example. In particular, I&#x27;ll show how we can imagine a forward pass in a simple recurrent neural network that enables a feedback effect to occur. We can then immediately see how gradient vanishing can become a problem within this framework (no sigmoids necessary). </p><p>Imagine that there is some sequence of vectors which are defined via the following recursive definition,</p><p> <span><style>.mjx-chtml {display: inline-block; line-height: 0; text-indent: 0; text-align: left; text-transform: none; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 100%; font-size-adjust: none; letter-spacing: normal; word-wrap: normal; word-spacing: normal; white-space: nowrap; float: none; direction: ltr; max-width: none; max-height: none; min-width: 0; min-height: 0; border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 1px 0}

However, <em>in</em> the case of vanilla recurrent neutral networks, this problem is almost unavoidable.

It is the first part in a series of blog posts which motivate and introduce pieces of infrastructure intended to improve our ability to forecast novel and uncertain domains like AI. </em></p><p><em>The Dictionary is currently in beta, and we&#x27;re launching early to get feedback from the community and quickly figure out how useful it is.</em></p><h3>Background and motivation</h3><p><strong>1) Operationalisation is an unsolved problem in forecasting</strong></p><p>A key challenge in (AI) forecasting is to write good questions. This is tricky because we want questions which <em>both</em> capture important uncertainties, <em>and</em> are sufficiently concrete that we can resolve them and award points to forecasters in hindsight. For example:</p><blockquote>Will there be a slow take-off?</blockquote><p>is a question that’s important yet too vague. </p><blockquote>Will there be a 4-year doubling of world output before the first 1-year doubling of world output?</blockquote><p>is both important and concrete, yet sufficiently far-out that it’s unclear if standard forecasting practices will be helpful in resolving it.</p><blockquote>Will there be a Starcraft II agent by the end of 2020 which is at least as powerful as AlphaStar, yet uses &lt;$10.000 of publicly available compute?</blockquote><p>is more amenable to standard forecasting practices, but at the cost of being only tangentially related to the high-level uncertainty we initially cared about. And so on.</p><p>Currently, forecasting projects reinvent this wheel of operationalisation all the time. There’s usually idiosyncratic and time-consuming processes of writing and testing questions (this might take many hours for a single question) [1], and best practices tend to evolve organically but without being systematically recorded and built upon [2]. </p><p><strong>2) The future is big, and forecasting it might require answering <em>a lot</em> of questions</strong></p><p>This is an empirical claim which we’ve become more confident by working in this space over the last year.</p><p>One way of seeing this is by attempting to break down an important high-level question into pieces. Suppose we want to get a handle on AI progress by investigating key inputs. We might branch those into progress on hardware, software, and data (including simulations). We might then branch hardware into economics and algorithmic parallelizability. To understand the economics, we must branch it into the supply and demand side, and we must then branch each of those to understand how they interface with regulation and innovation. This involves thousands of actors across academia, industry and government, and hundreds of different metrics for tracking progress of various kinds. And we’ve only done a brief depth-first search on one of the branches of the hard-software-data tree, which in turn is just one way of approaching the AI forecasting problem. </p><p>Another way of guesstimating this: <u><a href=""https://aiimpacts.org/archives/"">the AI Impacts archives</a></u> contains roughly 140 articles. Suppose this is 10% of the number of articles they’d need to accomplish their mission. If they each contains 1-30 uncertain claims that we’d ideally like to gather estimates on, that’s 1400 to 42000 uncertainties -- each of which would admit many different ways of being sufficiently operationalised. For reference, over the 4 years of the Good Judgement Project, roughly 500 questions were answered.</p><p>We’d of course be able to prune this space by focusing on the most important questions. Nonetheless, there seems to be a plausible case that scaling our ability to answer many questions is important if we want our forecasting efforts to succeed.</p><p>We see some evidence of this from the SciCast project, a prediction tournament on science and technology that ran from 2013-2015. The tournament organizers note the importance of scaling question generation through templates and the creation of a style guide. (See the <u><a href=""https://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/SciCast2015.pdf"">2015 Annual report</a></u>, p. 86.)</p><p><strong>3) So in order to forecast AI we must achieve economies-of-scale – making it cheap to write and answer the marginal question by efficiently reusing work across them.</strong></p><h3>AI Forecasting Dictionary</h3><p>As a piece of the puzzle to solve the above problems, we made the <u><a href=""https://parallel-forecast.github.io/AI-dict/"">AI Forecasting Dictionary</a></u>. It is an open-source set of standards and conventions for precisely interpreting AI and auxiliary terms.</p><p>Here’s an example entry:</p><blockquote><strong>Automatable</strong></blockquote><blockquote><em>See also: <a href=""https://parallel-forecast.github.io/AI-dict/docs/dictionary.html#job"">Job</a></em></blockquote><blockquote>A job is automatable at a time t if a machine can outperform the median-skilled employee, with 6 months of training or less, at 10,000x the cost of the median employee or less. Unless otherwise specified, the date of automation will taken to be the first time this threshold is crossed.</blockquote><blockquote>Examples:</blockquote><blockquote>*As of 2019, <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20190318031620/https://qz.com/932516/over-the-last-60-years-automation-has-totally-eliminated-just-one-us-occupation/"">Elevator Operator</a></blockquote><blockquote>Non-examples:</blockquote><blockquote>*As of 2019, Ambulance Driver</blockquote><blockquote>*As of 2019, Epidemiologist</blockquote><p>(This definition is based on Luke Muelhauser’s <u><a href=""https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/global-catastrophic-risks/potential-risks-advanced-artificial-intelligence/ai-timelines"">here</a></u>.)</p><p>There are several mechanisms whereby building a dictionary helps solve the problems outlined above. </p><p> <strong>Less overhead for writing and forecasting questions</strong></p><p>The dictionary reduces overhead in two ways: writers don’t have to reinvent the wheel whenever they operationalise a new thought, and forecasters can reduce the drag of constantly interpreting and understanding new resolutions. This makes it cheaper to both generate and answer the marginal question.</p><p><strong>A platform for spreading high initial costs over many future use cases</strong></p><p>There are a number of <a href=""https://parallel-forecast.github.io/AI-dict/docs/best-practices"">common pitfalls</a> that can make a seemingly valid question ambiguous or misleading. For example, positively resolving the question:</p><blockquote>Will an AI lab have been nationalized by 2024?</blockquote><p>by the US government nationalising GM as a response to a financial crisis, yet GM nonetheless having a self-driving car research division.</p><p>Or forecasting:</p><blockquote>When will there be a superhuman Angry Birds agent using no hardcoded knowledge?</blockquote><p>and realizing that there seems to be little active interest in the yearly benchmark competition (with performance even declining over years). This means that the probability entirely depends on whether anyone with enough money and competence decides to work on it, as opposed to what key components make Angry Birds difficult (e.g. physics-based simulation and planning) and how fast progress is in those domains.</p><p>Carefully avoiding such pitfalls comes with a high initial cost when writing the question. We can make that cost worth it by ensuring it is amortized across many future questions, and broadly used and built upon. A Dictionary is a piece of infrastructure that provides a standardised way of doing this. If someone spends a lot of time figuring out how to deal with a tricky edge case or a “spurious resolution”, there is now a Schelling point where they can store that work, and expect future users to read it (as well as where future users can expect them to have stored it).</p><p><strong>Version management</strong></p><p>When resolving and scoring quantitative forecasting questions, it’s important to know exactly what question the forecaster was answering. This need for precision often conflicts with the need to improve the resolution conditions from questions as we learn and stress-test them over time. For the Dictionary, we can use <u><a href=""https://semver.org/"">best practices for software version management</a></u> to help solve this problem. As of this writing, the Dictionary is still in beta, with the latest release being v0.3.0.</p><p><strong>Open-source serendipity</strong></p><p>The Dictionary might be useful not just for forecasting, but also for other contexts where precisely defined AI terms are important. We open-sourced it in order to allow people to experiment with such use cases. If you do so in a substantial way, please <u><a href=""mailto:hello@parallelforecast.com"">let us know</a></u>.  </p><h3>How to use the dictionary</h3><p>If you use the Dictionary for forecasting purposes, please reference it to help establish it as a standard of interpretation.</p><p>One way of doing this is by appending the tag [ai-dict-vX.Y.Z] at the end of the relevant string. For example:</p><blockquote>I predict that image classification will be made robust against unrestricted adversarial examples by 2023. [ai-dict-v2]</blockquote><p>or</p><blockquote>Will there be a superhuman Starcraft agent trained using less than $10.000 of publicly available compute by 2025? [ai-dict-v0.4]</blockquote><p>In some cases you might want to tweak or change the definitions of a term to match a particular use case, thereby departing from the Dictionary convention. If so, then you SHOULD mark the terms receiving a non-standard interpretation with the “^” symbol. For example:</p><blockquote>I expect unsupervised language models to be human-level^ by 2024. [ai-dict-v1.3]</blockquote><p>You might also want to add the following notice:</p><blockquote>For purposes of resolution, these terms are interpreted in accordance with the Technical AI Forecasting Resolution Dictionary vX.Y.Z, available at ai-dict.com. Any term whose interpretation deliberately departs from this standard has been marked with a ^.&quot;</blockquote><h3>How to contribute to the dictionary</h3><p>The AI Forecasting Dictionary is open-source, and you can contribute by making pull-requests to our GitHub or suggestions in the Google Doc version (more details <u><a href=""https://parallel-forecast.github.io/AI-dict/"">here</a></u>). We especially welcome: </p><ul><li>Attempts to introduce novel definitions that capture important terms in AI (current examples include: “<u><a href=""https://parallel-forecast.github.io/AI-dict/docs/dictionary.html#module"">module</a></u>”, “<u><a href=""https://parallel-forecast.github.io/AI-dict/docs/dictionary.html#transformative-artificial-intelligence"">transformative AI</a></u>” and “<u><a href=""https://parallel-forecast.github.io/AI-dict/docs/dictionary.html#compute-training"">compute (training)</a></u>”)</li><li>Examples of forecasting questions which you wrote and which ended up solving/making progress on some tricky piece of operationalisation, such that others can build on that progress</li></ul><p><strong>Footnotes</strong></p><p>[1] Some people might be compelled by an analogy to mathematics here: most of the work often lies in setting up the right formalism and problem formulation rather than in the actual proof (for example, Nash’s original fixed point theorems in game theory aren’t that difficultle once the set-up is in place, but realising why and how this kind of set-up was applicable to a large class of important problems was highly non-trivial). </p><p>[2] English Common Law is the clear example of how definitions and policies evolve over time to crystallize judgements and wisdom.  </p>",jacobjacob,bird-concept,Bird Concept,

After recently seeing Tyler Alterman make a Facebook post about estimations and System 1, it occurred to me that there are a few calibration exercises you can do with a deck of playing cards. The three exercises below are all variants of cutting/manipulating a deck of cards, and then trying to intuit something about the deck.</p><p>This serves three purposes:</p><ol><li>Get a feel for your System 1:</li><ol><li>The goal of the following three exercises is to see how good your gut is at estimating uncertainty (hint: probably better than you think!)</li></ol><li>Improve calibration:</li><ol><li>These exercises all allow for some room for error.

The entire deck is 52 cards, and you can easily tell if you&#x27;ve lifted up more or less than half (and this recurses). With a little practice. I&#x27;ve found that my gut is pretty good at this sort of thing. I&#x27;ll ask myself how many cards, and there will be a number that feels right.

It&#x27;s partially an estimation task because you need to know approximately where through the deck you saw the card, i.e. half-way, at the end, etc. To start, you can go slow, such that you can see each card as it slips off your thumb.</p><p>This gets harder the faster you riffle through the cards. To ramp up the difficulty, riffle faster, such that you can only get a fractional peek at each card&#x27;s corner.</p><p>Things to pay attention to:</p><ul><li>How does your visual experience of watching the cards differ when you <em>aren&#x27;t</em> looking for a particular card vs when you are? Does anything jump out at you? Are there false positives?</li><li>How many riffles through the deck does it take for you to glimpse the card?

<p>Verification and transparency are two kinds of things you can do to or with a software system. Verification is where you use a program to prove whether or not a system of interest has a property of interest. Transparency is where you use tools to make it clear how the software system works. I claim that these are intimately related.</p>

<h2>Examples of verification</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Proving that an alleged compiler actually implements the desired semantics of a system (for example, <a href=""https://cakeml.org/"">this verified implementation of ML</a>).</li>
  <li>Proving that a neural network’s classifications of a set of possible inputs are invariant under small perturbations to those inputs (for example, <a href=""http://cs229.stanford.edu/proj2018/report/101.pdf"">the system described in this paper</a>).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Example of transparency</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Sharing the source code of a program, rather than just compiled machine code (as encouraged by the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source-software_movement"">open-source software movement</a>).</li>
  <li>Demonstrating the types of inputs that neurons in a neural network are sensitive to (techniques like this are discussed in the fantastic <a href=""https://distill.pub/2018/building-blocks/"">Building Blocks of Interpretability</a> blog post).</li>
</ul>

<h2>How verification and transparency are sort of the same</h2>

<p>Apart from aesthetic cases, the purpose of transparency is to make the system transparent to some audience, so that members of that audience can learn about the system, and have that knowledge be intimately and necessarily entangled with the actual facts about the system. In other words, the purpose is to allow the users to verify certain properties of the system. As such, you might wonder why typical transparency methods look different than typical verification methods, which also have as a purpose allowing users to verify certain properties of a system.</p>

<h2>How verification and transparency are different</h2>

<p>Verification systems typically work by having a user specify a proposition to be verified, and then attempting to prove or disprove it. Transparency systems, on the other hand, provide an artefact that makes it easier to prove or disprove many properties of interest. It’s also the case that engagement with the ‘transparency artefact’ need not take the form of coming up with a proposition and then attempting to prove or disprove it: one may well instead interleave proving steps and specification steps, by looking at the artefact, having interesting lemmas come to mind, verifying those, which then inspire more lemmas, and so on.</p>

<h2>Intermediate things</h2>

<p>Thinking about this made me realise that many sorts of things both serve verification and transparency purposes. Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Type signatures in a strongly typed language can be seen as a method of ensuring that the compiler proves that certain errors cannot occur, while also giving a human reading the program a better sense of what various functions do.</li>
  <li>A mathematics textbook containing a large numbers of theorems, lemmas, and proofs is made by proving a large number of propositions, and allows a reader to gain an understanding of the relevant mathematical objects by perusing the theorems and lemmas, as well as by looking at the structure of the proofs.</li>

</style></span></span>, following all the steps in that research agenda. So I'll be posting a series of ""toy model pieces"", that will then be ultimately combined in a full toy model. Along the way, I hope to get a better understanding of how to do the research agenda in practice, and maybe even modify that agenda based on insights making the toy model.</p>
<p>For this post, I'll look in more detail into how to combine different types of (partial) preferences.</p>
<h1>Short-distance, long-distance, and other preferences</h1>
<p>I normally use <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_ethics"">population ethics</a> as my go-to-example for a tension between different types of preferences. You can get a lot of mileage by <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/fhkk75xKfqiqDnLBE/integral-versus-differential-ethics"">contrasting</a> the repugnance of the <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/repugnant-conclusion/"">repugnant conclusion</a> with the seeming intuitiveness of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mere_addition_paradox"">mere addition argument</a>.</p>
<p>However, many people who read this will have strong opinions about population ethics, or at least some opinions. Since I'm not trying to convince anyone of my particular population ethics here, I thought it best to shift to another setting where we could see similar tensions at work, without the baggage.</p>
<h2>Living in a world of smiles</h2>
<p>Suppose you have three somewhat contradictory ethical intuitions. Or rather, in the formulation of my <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CSEdLLEkap2pubjof/research-agenda-v0-9-synthesising-a-human-s-preferences-into"">research agenda</a>, two somewhat contradictory <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/BydQtwfN97pFwEWtW/toy-model-piece-1-partial-preferences-revisited"">partial preferences</a>.</p>
<p>The second is that any world would be better if people smiled more (<span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""P_1""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base"" style=""margin-right: -0.109em;""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.109em;"">P</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mn"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">1</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>). The third is that if almost everyone smiles all the time, it gets really creepy (<span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""P_2""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base"" style=""margin-right: -0.109em;""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.109em;"">P</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mn"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">2</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>).</p>
<p>Now, the proper way of resolving those preferences is to appeal to meta-preferences, or to cut them up into their <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ix3KdfJxjo9GQFkCo/web-of-connotations-bleggs-rubes-thermostats-and-beliefs"">web of connotations</a>: why do we value smiles? Is it because people are happy? Why do we find universal smiling creepy? Is it because we fear that something unnatural is making them smile that way? That's the proper way of resolving those preferences.</p>
<p>However, let's pretend there are no meta-preferences, and no connotations, and just try to combine the preferences as given.</p>

In this post, I seek to clarify the different ways that an impact measure could ultimately help align an artificial intelligence or otherwise benefit the long-term future.</p><p>It think it's possible <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/kCY9dYGLoThC3aG7w/best-reasons-for-pessimism-about-impact-of-impact-measures"">some critiques</a> of impact are grounded in an intuition that it doesn't help us achieve X, where X is something that the speaker <em>thought</em> impact was supposed to help us with, or is something that would be good to have in general. The obvious reply to these critiques is then to say that it was never intended to do X, and that impact penalties aren't meant to be a complete solution to alignment. </p><p>My hope is that in distinguishing the ways that impact penalties can help alignment, I will shed light on why some people are more pessimistic or optimistic than others. I am not necessarily endorsing the study of impact measurements as an especially tractable or important research area, but I do think it's useful to gather some of the strongest arguments for it.</p><p>Roughly speaking, I think that that an impact measure could potentially help humanity in at least one of four main scenarios. </p><p>1. Designing a utility function that roughly optimizes for what humans reflectively value, but with a recognition that mistakes are possible such that regularizing against extreme maxima seems like a good idea (ie. Impact as a regularizer).</p><p>2. Constructing an environment for testing AIs that we want to be extra careful about due to uncertainty regarding their ability to do something extremely dangerous (ie. Impact as a safety protocol). </p><p>3. Creating early-stage task AIs that have a limited function, but are not intended to do any large scale world optimization (ie. Impact as an influence-limiter).</p><p>4. Less directly, impact measures could still help humanity with alignment because researching them could allow us to make meaningful progress on <a href=""https://intelligence.org/2018/11/22/2018-update-our-new-research-directions/"">deconfusion</a> (ie Impact as deconfusion). </p><hr class=""dividerBlock""><h1>Impact as a regularizer</h1><p>In machine learning a regularizer is a term that we add to our loss function or training process that reduces the capacity of a model in the hopes of being able to generalize better. </p><p>One common instance of a regularizer is a scaled <span><style>.mjx-chtml {display: inline-block; line-height: 0; text-indent: 0; text-align: left; text-transform: none; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 100%; font-size-adjust: none; letter-spacing: normal; word-wrap: normal; word-spacing: normal; white-space: nowrap; float: none; direction: ltr; max-width: none; max-height: none; min-width: 0; min-height: 0; border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 1px 0}

A popular interpretation of this type of regularization is that it represents a prior over what we think the model parameters should be. For example, in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tikhonov_regularization"">Ridge Regression</a>, this interpretation can be made formal by invoking a Gaussian prior on the parameters. </p><p>The idea is that in the absence of vast evidence, we shouldn't allow the model to use its limited information to make decisions that <em>we the researchers</em> understand would be rash and unjustified given the evidence. </p><p>One framing of impact measures is that we can apply the same rationale to artificial intelligence. If we consider some scheme where an AI has been the task of undertaking <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5eX8ko7GCxwR5N9mN/what-is-ambitious-value-learning"">ambitious value learning</a>, we should make it so that whatever the AI initially believes is the true utility function <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""U""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.084em;"">U</span></span></span></span></span></span>, it should be extra cautious not to optimize the world so heavily unless it has gathered a very large amount of evidence that <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""U""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.084em;"">U</span></span></span></span></span></span> really is the right utility function. </p><p>One way that this could be realized is by some form of impact penalty which eventually gets phased out as the AI gathers more evidence. This isn't <em>currently</em> the way that I have seen impact measurement framed. However, to me it is still quite intuitive.</p><p>Consider a toy scenario where we have solved ambitious value learning and decide to design an AI to optimize human values in the long term. In this scenario, when the AI is first turned on, it is given the task of learning what humans want. In the beginning, in addition to its task of learning human values, it also tries helping us in low impact ways, perhaps by cleaning our laundry and doing the dishes. Over time, as it gathers enough evidence to fully understand human culture and philosophy, it will have the confidence to do things which are much more impactful, like becoming the CEO of some corporation.</p><p>I think that it's important to note that this is not what I currently think will happen in the real world. However, I think it's useful to imagine these types of scenarios because they offer concrete starting points for what a good regularization strategy might look like. In practice, I am not too optimistic about ambitious value learning, but more <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/4dHMdK5TLN6xcqtyc/p/vX7KirQwHsBaSEdfK"">narrow forms of value learning</a> could still benefit from impact measurements. As we are still somewhat far from any form of advanced artificial intelligence, uncertainty about which methods will work makes this analysis difficult. </p><h1>Impact as a safety protocol</h1><p>When I think about advanced artificial intelligence, my mind tends to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_chaining"">forward chain</a> from current AI developments, and imagines them being scaled up dramatically. In these types of scenarios, I'm most worried about something like <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/r9tYkB2a8Fp4DN8yB"">mesa optimization</a>, where in the process of making a model which performs some useful task, we end up searching over a very large space of optimizers that ultimately end up optimizing for some other task which we never intended for. </p><p>To oversimplify things for a bit, there are a few ways that we could ameliorate the issue of misaligned mesa optimization. One way is that we could find a way to robustly align arbitrary mesa objectives with base objectives. I am a bit pessimistic about this strategy working without some radical insights, because it currently seems really hard. If we could do that, it would be something which would require a huge chunk of alignment to be solved.</p><p>Alternatively, we could <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitelisting"">whitelist </a>our search space such that only certain safe optimizers could be discovered. This is a task where I see impact measurements could be helpful. </p><p>When we do some type of search over models, we could construct an explicit optimizer that forms the core of each model. The actual parameters that we perform gradient descent over would need to be limited enough such that we could still transparently see what type of ""utility function"" is being inner optimized, but not so limited that the model search itself would be useless.</p><p>If we could constrain and control this space of optimizers enough, then we should be able to explicitly add safety precautions to these mesa objectives. The exact way that this could be performed is a bit difficult for me to imagine. Still, I think that as long as we are able to perform some type of explicit constraint on what type of optimization is allowed, then it should be possible to penalize mesa optimizers in a way that could potentially avoid catastrophe. </p><p>During the process of training, the model will start unaligned and gradually shift towards performing better on the base objective. At any point during the training, we wouldn't want the model to try to do anything that might be extremely impactful, both because it will initially be unaligned, and because we are uncertain about the safety of the trained model itself. An impact penalty could thus help us to create a safe testing environment. </p><p>The intention here is not that we would add some type of impact penalty to the AIs that are <em>eventually</em> deployed. It is simply that as we perform the testing, there will be some limitation on much power we are giving the mesa optimizers. Having a penalty for mesa optimization can then be viewed as a short term safety patch in order to minimize the chances that an AI does something extremely bad that we didn't expect. </p><p>It is perhaps at first hard to see how an AI could be dangerous <em>during</em> the training process. But I believe that there is good reason to believe that as our experiments get larger, they will require artificial agents to understand more about the real world while they are training, which incurs significant risk. There are also specific predictable ways in which a model being trained could turn dangerous, such as in the case of <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/r9tYkB2a8Fp4DN8yB/p/zthDPAjh9w6Ytbeks"">deceptive alignment</a>. It is conceivable that having some way to reduce impact for optimizers in these cases will be helpful. </p><h1>Impact as an influence-limiter</h1><p>Even if we didn't end up putting an impact penalty directly into some type of ambitiously aligned AGI, or use it as a safety protocol during testing, there are still a few disjunctive scenarios in which impact measures could help construct limited AIs. A few examples would be if we were constructing <a href=""https://arbital.com/p/oracle/"">Oracle AIs</a> and <a href=""https://arbital.com/p/task_agi/"">Task AGIs</a>. </p><p>Impact measurements could help Oracles by cleanly providing a separation between ""just giving us true important information"" and ""heavily optimizing the world in the process."" This is, as I understand, one of the main issue with Oracle alignment at the moment, which means that intuitively an impact measurement could be quite helpful in that regard. </p><p>One rationale for constructing a task AGI is that it allows humanity to <a href=""https://arbital.com/p/pivotal/"">perform some type of important action</a> which buys us more time to solve the more ambitious varieties of alignment. I am personally less optimistic about this particular solution to alignment, as in my view it would require a very advanced form of coordination of artificial intelligence. In general I incline towards the view that competitive AIs will take the form of more <a href=""https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/Reframing_Superintelligence_FHI-TR-2019-1.1-1.pdf"">service-specific machine models</a>, which might imply that even if we succeeded at creating some low impact AGI that achieved a specific purpose, it wouldn't be competitive with the other AIs which that themselves have no impact penalty at all. </p><p>Still, there is a broad agreement that if we have a good theory about what is happening within an AI then we are more likely to succeed at aligning it. Creating agentic AIs seems like a good way to have that form of understanding. If this is the route that humanity ends up taking, then impact measurements could provide immense value.</p><p>This justification for impact measures is perhaps the most salient in the debate over impact measurements. It seems to be behind the critique that impact measurements need to be <em>useful</em> rather than just safe and value-neutral. At the same time, I know from personal experience that there at least one person currently thinking about ways we can leverage current impact penalties to be useful in this scenario. Since I don't have a good model for how this can be done, I will refrain from specific rebuttals of this idea.</p><h1>Impact as deconfusion</h1><p>The concept of impact appears to neighbor other relevant alignment concepts, like <a href=""https://arbital.com/p/soft_optimizer/"">mild optimization</a>, <a href=""https://arbital.com/p/45/"">corrigibility</a>, <a href=""https://arbital.com/p/shutdown_problem/"">safe shutdowns</a>, and <a href=""https://arbital.com/p/task_goal/"">task AGIs</a>. I suspect that even if impact measures are never actually used in practice, there is still some potential that drawing clear boundaries between these concepts will help clarify approaches for designing powerful artificial intelligence. </p><p>This is essentially my model for why some AI alignment researchers believe that deconfusion is helpful. Developing a rich vocabulary for describing concepts is a key feature of how science advances. Particularly clean and insightful definitions help clarify ambiguity, allowing researchers to say things like ""That technique sounds like it is a combination of X and Y without having the side effect of Z."" </p><p>A good counterargument is that there isn't any particular reason to believe that <em>this</em> concept requires priority for deconfusion. It would be bordering on a <a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/11/03/all-in-all-another-brick-in-the-motte/"">motte and bailey</a> to claim that some particular research will lead to deconfusion and then when pressed I appeal to research in general. I am not <em>trying</em> to do that here. Instead, I think that impact measurements are potentially good because they focus attention on a subproblem of AI, in particular catastrophe avoidance. And I also think there has empirically been demonstrable progress in a way that provides evidence that this approach is a good idea. </p><p>Consider David Manheim and Scott Garrabrant's <a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.04585.pdf"">Categorizing Variants of Goodhart's Law</a>. For those unaware, Goodhart's law is roughly summed up in the saying ""Whenever a measure becomes a target, it ceases to become a good measure."" This paper tries to catalog all of the different cases which this phenomenon could arise. Crucially, it isn't necessary for the paper to actually present a solution to Goodhart's law in order to illuminate how we could avoid the issue. By distinguishing ways in which the law holds, we can focus on addressing those specific sub-issues rather than blindly coming up with one giant patch for the entire problem.</p><p>Similarly, the idea of impact measurement is a confusing concept. There's one interpretation in which an ""impact"" is some type of distance between two representations of the world. In this interpretation, saying that something had a large impact is another way of saying that the world changed a lot as a result. In <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/pf48kg9xCxJAcHmQc/understanding-recent-impact-measures"">newer interpretations</a> of impact, we like to say that an impact is really about a difference in what we are able to achieve.</p><p>A distinction between ""difference in world models"" and ""differences in what we are able to do"" is subtle, and enlightening (at least to me). It allows a new terminology in which I can talk about the <em>impact</em> of artificial intelligence. For example, in Nick Bostrom's founding paper on existential risk studies, his definition for existential risk included events which could</p><blockquote>permanently and drastically curtail [humanity's] potential. </blockquote><p>One interpretation of this above definition is that Bostrom was referring to <em>potential </em>in the sense of the second definition of impact rather than the first.</p><p>A highly unrealistic way that this distinction could help us is if we had some future terminology which allowed us to unambiguously ask AI researchers to ""see how much impact this new action will have on the world."" AI researchers could then boot up an Oracle AI and ask the question in a crisply formalized framework.</p><p>More realistically, the I could imagine that the field may eventually stumble on useful cognitive strategies to frame the alignment problem such that impact measurement becomes a convenient precise concept to work with. As AI gets more powerful, the way that we understand alignment will become <a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Near/far_thinking"">nearer</a> to us, forcing us to quickly adapt our language and strategies to the specific evidence we are given.</p><p>Within a particular subdomain, I think an AI researcher could ask questions about what they are trying to accomplish, and talk about it using the vocabulary of well understood topics, which could eventually include impact measurements. The idea of impact measurement is simple enough that it will (probably) get independently invented a few times as we get closer to powerful AI. Having thoroughly examined the concept <em>ahead</em> of time rather than afterwards offers future researchers a standard toolbox of precise, deconfused language. </p><p>I do not think the terminology surrounding impact measurements will ever quite reach the ranks of terms like ""regularizer"" or ""loss function"" but I do have an inclination to think that <em>simple </em>and <em>common sense</em> concepts should be rigorously defined as the field advances. Since we have intense uncertainty about the type of AIs that will end up being powerful, or about the approaches that will be useful, it is possibly most helpful at this point in time to develop tools which can reliably be handed off for future researchers, rather than putting too much faith into one particular method of alignment.</p>",matthew-barnett,matthew-barnett,Matthew Barnett,

<p><em>Low confidence; offering this up for discussion</em></p>
<p>An Oracle AI is an AI that only answers questions, and doesn't take any other actions. The opposite of an Oracle AI is an Agent AI, which might also send emails, control actuators, etc.</p>
<p>I'm especially excited about the possibility of non-self-improving oracle AIs, dubbed <strong>Tool AI</strong> in a <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6SGqkCgHuNr7d4yJm/thoughts-on-the-singularity-institute-si"">2012 article by Holden Karnofsky</a>.</p>
<p>I've seen two arguments against this ""Tool AI"":</p>
<ul>
<li>First, as in <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/sizjfDgCgAsuLJQmm/reply-to-holden-on-tool-ai"">Eliezer's 2012 response to Holden</a>, we don't know how to safely make and operate an oracle AGI (just like every other type of AGI). Fair enough! I never said this is an easy solution to all our problems! (But see my <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/EMZeJ7vpfeF4GrWwm/self-supervised-learning-and-agi-safety"">separate post</a> for why I'm thinking about this.)</li>
<li>Second, as in <a href=""https://www.gwern.net/Tool-AI"">Gwern's 2016 essay</a>, there's a coordination problem. Even if we could build a safe oracle AGI, the argument goes, there will still be an economic incentive to build an agent AGI, because you can do more and better and faster by empowering the AGI to take actions. Thus, agreeing to never ever build agent AGIs is a very hard coordination problem for society. <strong>I don't find the coordination argument compelling—in fact, I think it's backwards—and I wrote this post to explain why.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2>Five reasons I don't believe the coordination / competitiveness argument against oracles</h2>
<p><strong>1. If the oracle isn't smart or powerful enough for our needs, we can solve that by bootstrapping.</strong> Even if the oracle is not inherently self-modifying, we can ask it for advice and do human-in-the-loop modifications to make more powerful successor oracles. By the same token, we can ask an oracle AGI for advice about how to design a safe agent AGI.</p>
<p><strong>2. Avoiding coordination problems is a pipe dream; we need to solve the coordination problem at some point, and that point might as well be at the oracle stage.</strong> As far as I can tell, we will <em>never</em> get to a stage where we know how to build safe AGIs <em>and</em> where there is <em>no possibility</em> of making more-powerful-and-less-safe AGIs. If we have a goal in the world that we really really want to happen, a <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/TPy4RJvzogqqupDKk/a-survey-of-early-impact-measures"">low-impact agent</a> is going to be less effective than a not-impact-restrained agent; an <a href=""https://ai-alignment.com/act-based-agents-8ec926c79e9c"">act-based agent</a> is going to be less effective than a goal-seeking agent;<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-G7cD5tN5AkQLyNwtH-1"" id=""fnref-G7cD5tN5AkQLyNwtH-1"">[1]</a></sup> and so on and so forth. It seems likely that, no matter how powerful a safe AGI we can make, there will always be an incentive for people to try experimenting with <em>even more</em> powerful unsafe alternative designs.</p>
<p>Therefore, at some point in AI development, we have to blow the whistle, declare that technical solutions aren't enough, and we need to start relying 100% on actually solving the coordination problem. When is that point? Hopefully far enough along that we realize the benefits of AGI for humanity—automating the development of new technology to help solve problems, dramatically improving our ability to think clearly and foresightedly about our decisions, and so on. Oracles can do all that! So why not just stop when we get to AGI oracles?</p>
<p>Indeed, once I started thinking along those lines, I actually see the coordination argument going in the other direction! I say restricting ourselves to oracle AI make coordination <em>easier</em>, not harder! Why is that? Two more reasons:</p>
<p><strong>3. We want a high technological barrier between us and the most dangerous systems:</strong> These days, I don't think anyone takes seriously the idea of building an all-powerful benevolent dictator AGI implementing <a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Coherent_Extrapolated_Volition"">CEV</a>. [ETA: If you <em>do</em> take that idea seriously, see point 1 above on bootstrapping.] At least as far as I can tell from the public discourse, there seems to be a growing consensus that humans should always and forever be in the loop of AGIs. (That certainly sounds like a good idea to me!) Thus, the biggest coordination problem we face is: ""Don't ever make a human-out-of-the-loop free-roaming AGI world-optimizer."" This is made easier by having a <em>high technological barrier</em> between the safe AGIs that we are building and using, and the free-roaming AGI world-optimizers that we are forbidding. If we make an agent AGI—whether corrigible, aligned, norm-following, low-impact, or whatever—I just don't see any technological barrier there. It seems like it would be <em>trivial</em> for a rogue employee to tweak such an AGI to stop asking permission, deactivate the self-restraint code, and go tile the universe with hedonium at all costs (or whatever that rogue employee happens to value). By contrast, if we stop when we get to oracle AI, it seems like there would be a higher technological barrier to turning it into a free-roaming AGI world-optimizer—probably not <em>that</em> high a barrier, but higher than the alternatives. (The height of this technological barrier, and indeed whether there's a barrier at all, is hard to say.... It probably depends on how exactly the oracles are constructed and access-controlled.)</p>
<p><strong>4. We want a bright-line, verifiable rule between us and the most dangerous systems:</strong> Even more importantly, take the rule:</p>
<p><em>""AGIs are not allowed to do anything except output pixels onto a screen.""</em></p>
<p>This is a nice, simple, bright-line rule, which moreover has at least a <em>chance</em> of being verifiable by external auditors. By contrast, if we try to draw a line through the universe of agent AGIs, defining how low-impact is low-impact enough, how act-based is act-based enough, and so on, it seems to me like it would inevitably be a complicated, blurry, and unenforceable line. This would make a very hard coordination problem very much harder still.</p>
<p>[Clarifications on this rule: (A) I'm not saying this rule would be <em>easy</em> to enforce (globally and forever), only that it would be less hard than alternatives; (B) I'm not saying that, if we enforce this rule, we are free and clear of all possible existential risks, but rather that this would be a very helpful ingredient along with other control and governance measures; (C) Again, I'm presupposing here that we succeed in making superintelligent AI oracles that always give honest and non-manipulative answers; (D) I'm not saying we should outlaw all AI agents, just that we should outlaw world-modeling AGI agents. Narrow-AI robots and automated systems are fine. (I'm not sure exactly how <em>that</em> line would be drawn.)]</p>
<p>Finally, one more thing:</p>
<p><strong>5. Maybe superintelligent oracle AGI is ""a solution built to last (at most) until all contemporary thinking about AI has been thoroughly obsoleted...I don’t think there is a strong case for thinking much further ahead than that.""</strong> (copying from <a href=""https://ai-alignment.com/act-based-agents-8ec926c79e9c"">this Paul Christiano post</a>).  I hate this argument. It's a cop-out. It's an excuse to recklessly plow forward with no plan and everything at stake. But I have to admit, it seems to have a kernel of truth...</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We should seriously consider the possibility that we'll build AGIs by self-supervised learning. If so, the AGI safety issues seem to be in many respects different (and I think more promising) than in the usual reinforcement learning paradigm. In particular, I'll propose that if we follow certain constraints, these systems can be turned into safe, unambitious AGI oracles. I'll end with lots of open questions.</p>
<p><strong>Epistemic status:</strong> Treat as brainstorming. This post supersedes my previous post on this general topic, <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/SaLc9Dv5ZqD73L3nE/the-self-unaware-ai-oracle"">The Self-Unaware AI Oracle</a> for reasons mentioned below.</p>
<h1>What is self-supervised learning, and why might it lead to AGI?</h1>
<p>Self-supervised learning consists of taking data, masking off part of it, and training an ML system to use the unmasked data to predict the masked data. To make the predictions better and better, the system needs to develop an increasingly deep and comprehensive semantic understanding of the world. For example, say there's a movie with a rock falling towards the ground. If you want to correctly predict what image will be in the frame a few seconds ahead, you need to predict that the rock will stop when it gets to the ground, not continue falling. Or if there's a movie with a person saying ""I'm going to sit down now"", you need to predict that they might well sit in a chair, and probably won't start dancing.</p>
<p>Thus, predicting something has close relationship with understanding it. Imagine that you're in a lecture class on a topic where you're already an expert. As the professor is talking, you feel you can often finish their sentences. By contrast, when you're lost in a sea of jargon you don't understand, you can only finish their sentences with a much wider probability distribution (""they're probably going to say some jargon word now"").</p>
<p>The term ""self-supervised learning"" (replacing the previous and more general term ""unsupervised learning"") seems to come from Yann LeCun, chief AI scientist at Facebook and co-inventor of CNNs. As he wrote <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/722677142/posts/10155934004262143/"">here</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I now call it ""self-supervised learning"", because ""unsupervised"" is both a loaded and confusing term.</p>
<p>In self-supervised learning, the system learns to predict part of its input from other parts of it input. In other words a portion of the input is used as a supervisory signal to a predictor fed with the remaining portion of the input.</p>
<p>Self-supervised learning uses way more supervisory signals than supervised learning, and enormously more than reinforcement learning. That's why calling it ""unsupervised"" is totally misleading. That's also why more knowledge about the structure of the world can be learned through self-supervised learning than from the other two paradigms: the data is unlimited, and amount of feedback provided by each example is huge.</p>
<p>Self-supervised learning has been enormously successful in natural language processing...So far, similar approaches haven't worked quite as well for images or videos because of the difficulty of representing distributions over high-dimensional continuous spaces.</p>
<p>Doing this properly and reliably is the greatest challenge in ML and AI of the next few years in my opinion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As mentioned in this quote, we have a couple good examples of self-supervised learning. One is humans. Here's Yann LeCun again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most of human and animal learning is [self]-supervised learning. If intelligence was a cake, [self]-supervised learning would be the cake, supervised learning would be the icing on the cake, and reinforcement learning would be the cherry on the cake.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, the brain is constantly making probabilistic predictions about everything it is going to see, hear, and feel, and updating its internal models when those predictions are wrong. Have you ever taken a big drink from a glass of orange juice that you had thought was a glass of water? Or walked into a room and immediately noticed that the table is in the wrong place? It's because you were predicting those sensations in detail before they happened. This is a core part of what the human brain does, and what it means to understand things.<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-qKuacQd9FnDnXLneE-1"" id=""fnref-qKuacQd9FnDnXLneE-1"">[1]</a></sup> Self-supervised learning not the <em>only</em> ingredient in human intelligence—obviously we also have internal and external rewards, environmental interaction, and so on—but I'm inclined to agree with Yann LeCun that self-supervised learning is the cake.<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-qKuacQd9FnDnXLneE-2"" id=""fnref-qKuacQd9FnDnXLneE-2"">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Beyond humans, language models like <a href=""https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/"">GPT-2</a> are a nice example of how far self-supervised learning can go, even when restricted to today's technology and an impoverished text-only datastream. See the SSC post <a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/02/19/gpt-2-as-step-toward-general-intelligence/"">GPT-2 as step towards general intelligence</a>.</p>
<p>Thus, <strong>this post is nominally about the scenario where we make superintellignent AGI by 100% self-supervised learning</strong> (all cake, no cherries, no icing, in Yann LeCun's analogy). I consider this a live possibility but far from certain. I'll leave to future work the related scenario of ""mostly self-supervised learning plus some reinforcement learning or other techniques"". (See Open Questions below.)</p>
<p><strong>What does self-supervised learning look like under the hood?</strong> GPT-2 and similar language models are based on a <a href=""https://nostalgebraist.tumblr.com/post/185326092369/the-transformer-explained"">Transformer neural net</a>, trained by stochastic gradient descent as usual. The brain, to my limited understanding, does self-supervised learning (mainly using the neocortex, hippocampus, and thalamus) via a dozen or so interconnected processes, some of which are massively parallelized (the same computational process running in thousands of locations at once).<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-qKuacQd9FnDnXLneE-3"" id=""fnref-qKuacQd9FnDnXLneE-3"">[3]</a></sup> These processes are things vaguely like: ""If a spatiotemporal pattern recurs several times in a certain context, assign that pattern a UUID, and pass that UUID upwards to the next layer in the hierarchy"", and ""Pull two items out of memory, look for a transformation between them, and catalog it if it is found"".<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-qKuacQd9FnDnXLneE-4"" id=""fnref-qKuacQd9FnDnXLneE-4"">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>If I had to guess, I would expect that the ML community will eventually find neural net data structures and architectures that can do these types of brain-like processes—albeit probably not in exactly the same way that the brain does them—and we'll get AGI shortly thereafter. I think it's somewhat less likely, but not impossible, that we'll get AGI by just, say, scaling up the Transformer to some ridiculous size. Either way, I won't speculate on how long it might take to get to AGI, if this is the path. But my vague impression is that self-supervised learning is a hot research area undergoing rapid progress.</p>
<h1>Impact for safety: General observations</h1>
<h2>1. Output channel is not part of the training</h2>
<p><img src=""https://sjbyrnes.com/LW_selfsupervised_vs_RL.PNG"" alt=""""></p>
<p>In the reinforcement learning (RL) path to AGI, we wind up creating a system consisting of a world-model attached to an output channel that reaches out into the world and does useful things, and we optimize this whole system. By contrast, in the Self-Supervised Learning path to AGI, we wind up by default with more-or-less just a bare world model. At least, that's the way I'm thinking about it. I mean, sure, it has an output channel in the sense that it can output predictions for masked bits of a file, but that's incidental, not really part of the AGI's primary intended function, i.e. answering questions or doing things. We obviously need <em>some</em> sort of more useful output, but whatever that output is, it's not involved in the training. This opens up some options in the design space that haven't been well explored.</p>
<p>My last post, <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/SaLc9Dv5ZqD73L3nE/the-self-unaware-ai-oracle"">The Self-Unaware AI Oracle</a>, is a rather extreme example of that, where we would try to build a world model that <em>not only</em> has no knowledge that it is attached to an output channel, but doesn't even know it <em>exists</em> as an information-processing system! My (admittedly vague) proposal for that was to isolate the world-model from any reflective information about how the world-model is being built and analyzed. This is an extreme example, and after further thought I now think it's entirely unnecessary, but I still think it's a nice example of new things we might do in this different design space.<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-qKuacQd9FnDnXLneE-5"" id=""fnref-qKuacQd9FnDnXLneE-5"">[5]</a></sup></p>
<h2>2. No need for a task-specific reward signal</h2>
<p>Let's say we want to build a question-answering system by RL. Well, we need to train it by asking questions, and rewarding it for a good answer. This is tricky, to put it mildly. The questions we really care about are ones where we don't necessarily know the answer. How do we get lots of good data? What if we make mistakes in the training set? What if the system learns to optimize a proxy to the reward function, rather than the reward function itself? What if it learns to manipulate the reward function, e.g. by self-fulfilling prophecies? I don't want to say these are impossible challenges, and I'm glad lots of people are working on them. But the self-supervised learning approach seems to largely skirt all these issues.</p>
<p>For self-supervised learning, the paradigm is a bit different. There is, of course, a reward signal guiding the machine learning, namely ""predict the masked bits in the input data, using the unmasked bits"". But we treat that as purely a method to construct a world-model. Then we ask a separate question: ""Now that we have a predictive world-model, how do we <em>use</em> it to make the world a better place""? This step is mainly about building an interface, not building an intelligence. Now, I don't think this task is by any means easy (see ""Open questions"" below), but I do suspect that it's easier than the various RL challenges above.</p>
<h2>3. The world-model acquires some safety-enhancing knowledge automatically</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Natural-language bridge into the world-model:</strong> When we build a world model by self-supervised learning of human-created content, the world model should wind up with an understanding of the real world, an understanding of human language and concepts, and (importantly) an understanding of how these two map onto each other. This should be very helpful for using the world model to answer our questions, and might also offer some (limited) degree of <strong>interpretability</strong> of the unimaginably complicated guts of the world-model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Understanding of typical human norms, behaviors, and values:</strong> When we build a world model by self-supervised learning of human-created content, the world model should wind up with an excellent predictive understanding of typical human behavior. So let's say we can ask it a counterfactual question like <em>If there were no AGIs in the world, what's the likeliest way that a human might find a cure for Alzheimer's?</em> (Put aside for now the issue of how we ask the question—see Open Questions below.) The answer to that question would be a kind of overlap between real-world compatibility (the cure actually works) and human compatibility (it should be the kind of ""cures for Alzheimer's"" that humans want and would plausibly be looking for). That's what we want! By contrast, a superintelligent biologist with alien motivation system would be likelier to ""cure Alzheimer's"" by some method that is impractical, or that exploits loopholes in our definition of ""cure"", etc. (So this incidentally also helps with <strong>Goodhart's law</strong>.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Constraints under which a self-supervised-learning world-model can be built into a safe AGI system</h1>
<p>A system that can make great predictions of masked bits in a data file is not really useful, and not really something I would call an AGI. We need to build something around the world model, so that it can answer questions or take actions.</p>
<p>Once we start moving in this direction, I think it's very easy to wander into dangerous territory. But, as a starting point, I offer this set of constraints. I believe that if we build an AGI using 100% self-supervised learning, and we follow all these constraints, then the system will be safe—more specifically, it will not do not wield its world model to do foresighted planning towards real-world consequences. Here's my list of constraints:</p>
<ul>
<li>The system is used as an oracle, i.e. it answers questions but does not take any other actions. (See my separate post: <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/AKtn6reGFm5NBCgnd/in-defense-of-oracle-tool-ai"">In defense of Oracle (""Tool"") AI</a>.)</li>
<li>We only ask non-self-referential counterfactual questions along the lines of: <em>If there were no AGIs in the world, what's a likely way that someone might design a better solar cell?</em> This avoids the various problem of self-fulfilling prophecies, such as discussed by Stuart Armstrong in <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/hJaJw6LK39zpyCKW6/standard-ml-oracles-vs-counterfactual-ones"">this</a> and follow-up posts, as well as steering towards solutions compatible with human norms and values as discussed above.</li>
<li>We fix the training data (what data to look at and what bits to predict, in what order) before we ever start training the system, then we ""lock down"" the world-model after the training (as opposed to letting it evolve further during question-and-answer operation), and moreover do not allow the oracle to do anything except output answers (no follow-up questions, no asking for more data about some topic, no running simulations in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COMSOL_Multiphysics"">COMSOL</a>, etc.).</li>
<li>For asking questions and getting answers, we don't try to build a new interface into the world model, but rather build some wrapper around its existing predict-masked-bits interface. (It's not obvious that we can build such a wrapper that works well, but I'm hopeful, and see Open Questions below.)</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm pretty sure some of these constraints are unnecessarily strict; and conversely, I may be forgetting or leaving off some important requirement.</p>
<h2>Why won't it try to get more predictable data?</h2>
<p><em>(Update: After further thought, I am now less confident that this section is correct. See <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/L3Ryxszc3X2J7WRwt/self-supervised-learning-and-manipulative-predictions"">Self-supervised learning &amp; manipulative predictions</a>.)</em></p>
<p>Why do I think that such an AGI would be safe? (Again, I mean more narrowly that it won't wield its world model to do foresighted planning towards real-world consequences—which is the worst, but not only, thing that can go wrong.) Here's one possible failure mode that I was thinking about. I'm sure some readers are thinking it too:</p>
<p><em>Oh, it optimizes its ability to predict masked bits from a file, eh? Well it's going to manipulate us, or threaten us, or hack itself, to get easy-to-predict files of all 0's!!</em></p>
<p>I say that this will not happen with any reasonable self-supervised learning algorithm that we'd be likely to build, if we follow the constraints above.</p>
<p>Gradient descent is a particularly simple example to think about here. In gradient descent, when the world-model makes a bad prediction, the model is edited such that the updated model would (in retrospect) have been likelier to get the right answer for that particular bit. Since the optimization pressure is retrospective (""backwards-facing"" in <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/hJaJw6LK39zpyCKW6/standard-ml-oracles-vs-counterfactual-ones"">Stuart Armstrong's terminology</a>), we are not pushing the system to do things like ""seeking easier-to-predict files"", which help with forward-looking optimization but are irrelevant to retrospective optimization. Indeed, even if the system randomly stumbled upon that kind of forward-looking strategy, further gradient descent steps would be just as likely to randomly discard it again! (Remember, I stipulated above that we will fix in advance what the training data will be, and in what order it will be presented.)</p>
<p>(Neuromorphic world-model-building algorithms do not work by gradient descent, and indeed we don't really know exactly how they would work, but from what we do know, I think they also would be unlikely to do forward-looking optimization.)</p>
<p>The algorithm will, of course, search ruthlessly for patterns that shed light on the masked bits. If it takes longer to read 1s from RAM than 0s (to take a silly example), and if the pattern-finder has access to timing information, then of course it will find the pattern and start making better predictions on that basis. This is not a <a href=""https://ai-alignment.com/techniques-for-optimizing-worst-case-performance-39eafec74b99"">malign failure mode</a>, and if it happens, we can fix these side channels using cybersecurity best practices.</p>
<h1>Open questions (partial list!)</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Input and output:</strong> How <em>exactly</em> do we give the system input and output? Predicting masked bits has obvious shortcomings, like that it naturally tries to predict what a flawed humans might say on some topic, rather than what the truth is. This problem may be solvable by doing things like flagging some inputs as highly reliable, and trusting the system to automatically learn the association of that flag with truth and insight, and then priming the system with that flag when we ask it questions. Or would it be better to build a new, separate interface into the guts of the world model? If so, how?</li>
<li><strong>Sculpting the world model:</strong> There may be too much information in the world for our best algorithms to learn it all. Thus an entomologist and botanist can look at the same picture of a garden but enrich their world-models in very different directions. (When <em>I</em> look at a picture of a garden, I zone out and learn nothing whatsoever.) In humans, our innate goals play a critical role in directing the learning process (see my later post <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/cfvBm2kBtFTgxBB7s/predictive-coding-rl-sl-bayes-mpc"">Predictive Coding = RL + SL + Bayes + MPC</a>), but I was hoping to avoid those types of real-world goals; what do we do instead? Can we flag some masked bits as really important to ""think about"" longer and harder before making a prediction? Or what?</li>
<li><strong>Training data:</strong> Exactly what data should we feed it? Is there dangerous data that we need to censor? Is there unhelpful data that makes it dumber? Is text enough to get AGI, or does there also need to be audio and video? (People can be perfectly intelligent without sight or hearing, though they do have <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactile_graphic"">tactile graphics</a>...) Books, articles, and YouTube are obvious sources of training data; are there less obvious but important data sources we should also be thinking about? How does the choice of training data impact safety and interpretability?</li>
<li><strong>Adding in supervised or reinforcement learning:</strong> I've been assuming that we use 100% self-supervised learning to build the AGI. Can we sprinkle in some supervised or reinforcement learning, e.g. as a fine-tuning step, as a way to build an interface into the world model, or as a kind of supervisor to the main training? If so, how, and how would that impact safety and capabilities? (Update: For more on how the brain combines SSL &amp; RL, see my later post: <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/cfvBm2kBtFTgxBB7s/predictive-coding-rl-sl-bayes-mpc"">Predictive Coding = RL + SL + Bayes + MPC</a>.)</li>
<li><strong>Capabilities:</strong> Would a system subject to the constraints listed above nevertheless be powerful enough to do the things we want AGIs to do, and if not, can we relax some of those constraints? Can a world model get bigger and richer forever, or will it grind to a halt after deeply understanding the first 300,000 journal articles it reads? More generally, how do these things scale?</li>
<li><strong>Agency:</strong> Can we safely give it a bit of agency in requesting more information, or asking follow-up questions, or interfacing with other software or databases? Or more boldly, can we safely give it a <em>lot</em> of agency, e.g. a 2-way internet connection, and if so, how?</li>
<li><strong>Experiments:</strong> Can we shed light on any of these questions by playing with GPT-2 or other language models? Is there some other concrete example we can find or build? Like, is there any benefit to doing self-supervised learning on a corpus of text and movies talking about the Game Of Life universe?</li>
<li><strong>Safety:</strong> I mentioned a couple possible failure mode above, and said that I didn't think they were concerning. But this obviously needs much more careful thought and analysis before we can declare victory. What are other failure modes we should be thinking about?</li>
<li><strong>Timelines and strategy:</strong> If we get AGI by 100% self-supervised learning, how does that impact takeoff speed, timelines, likelihood of unipolar vs multipolar scenarios,  <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/x3fNwSe5aWZb5yXEG/reframing-superintelligence-comprehensive-ai-services-as"">CAIS</a>-like suites of narrow systems versus monolithic all-purpose systems, etc.?</li>
</ul>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>I hope I've made the point that self-supervised learning scenarios are plausible, and bring forth a somewhat different and neglected set of issues and approaches in AGI safety. I hope I'm not the only one working on it! There's tons of work to do, and god knows I can't do it myself! (I have a full-time job...) :-)</p>

(2) Babies' understanding of the world is clearly developing long before they have enough motor control to learn things by interacting (see discussion in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_permanence"">Object permanence on wikipedia</a>, though I suppose one could also give the credit to brain development in general rather than self-supervised learning in particular).

AND Is the outcome creating positive emotional affect for you?</li></ul><p>Because these are two seperate questions, they can have two separate answers. It's not common, but you can believe that you are unlikely to succeed, whilst also having the internal emotional experience associated with confidence. You could wish that you had made a different decision without necessarily feeling negative emotions because of it. You can have an outcome that isn't in line with your preferences, but experience positive emotional affect by looking on the bright side.</p><p><strong>Truth</strong></p><p>Properties like true or false only strictly apply to beliefs. Whether or not you are likely to succeed is either true or false, but this doesn't apply to the emotive affect of confidence itself. Someone can affectively feel very ""confident"" without being factually wrong.</p><p><strong>Calibration</strong></p><p>Nonetheless, explicit knowledge isn't the only knowledge contained in our brains. We also possess implicit knowledge and this can be calibrated or uncalibrated. Since these are heuristics, they can't literally be true or false or it would no longer be a heuristic. But we can create different measures of how accurate these heuristics are.</p><p>Emotions are linked to our heuristics, so we don't always want to shift ourselves towards feeling positive affect as this might bias us. However, emotions are seperate from implicit knowledge. For example, someone can have implicit knowledge that something is a bad idea, without experiencing negative affect like a sense of dread. Alternatively, someone can have a sense of dread, yet also have a strong intuition that that it is the right decision. Since they are separate, they'll be times when we can experience positive affect instead of the ""appropriate"" emotion without having a significantly detrimental impact on our calibration.</p><p>Unfortunately, it is very hard to predict to what extent emotions affect our implicit understanding. This means it is very hard to figure out the appropriate trade-off in terms of feeling positive affect vs. avoiding bias. Nonetheless, I would be astonished if the best trade-off involved taking no risk at all (see <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/KsHmn6iJAEr9bACQW/bayesians-vs-barbarians"">Barbarians vs. Bayesians</a> for the opposite stance).</p><p><strong>Final thoughts</strong></p><p>So far, I've mainly experimented with cognitive defusion as described by <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/mELQFMi9egPn5EAjK/my-attempt-to-explain-looking-insight-meditation-and"">Kaj Solata</a>. In many cases, this has allowed me to cognitively think that an outcome is bad, without having any significant emotive affect. Note that I limit my use of this, because sometimes I see advantages of experiencing negative affect. I mean, from an evolutionary psychology perspective, experiencing negative emotions makes a mistake stick in our brain for longer and has a greater impact on our implicit beliefs.</p><p>Unfortunately, I'm not similarly successful in creating positive effect. All I can recommend at the moment is allowing yourself to feel positive affect, even if you are aware the the reason you are feeling it is quite ""silly"".</p><p>This approach is somewhat influenced by Buddhism, but is also distinct from it. I've heard people influenced by Buddhism say things like, ""there is no such thing as good or bad, it's all in your mind"" and I find that really frustrating. I suppose that if I was a perfect, equanimous enlightened being than there really wouldn't be a difference, but given that I am not, some things really are bad for me and some really are good. It resonates with me much more to think, ""this situation is bad, but I don't have to feel bad"". I won't claim that this works for everyone, but that's just what I've found useful so far.</p>",Chris_Leong,chris_leong,Chris_Leong,

The <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/TPy4RJvzogqqupDKk/a-survey-of-early-impact-measures"">last post</a> in this sequence was intended to somewhat comprehensively review this literature, but it surveyed only four papers total, including the original article.</p><p>In the last two years, research has now picked up pace by a significant margin. The two papers which are most significant are <a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01186.pdf"">Penalizing side effects using stepwise relative reachability</a> by Victoria Krakovna et al. and <a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.09725.pdf"">Conservative Agency</a> by Alexander Turner et al. In that time a few blog posts have come out explaining the approaches in more detail, and public debate over the utility of impact measures has become much more visible. </p><p>Here I will briefly explain the two most prominent measures, relative reachability and attainable utility. We will see that they diverge conceptually from earlier research. By being different, they also end up satisfying some desirable properties. I will then consider some recent notable critiques of impact measures more generally. A personal analysis of these critiques will wait one more day. This post will only cover the surface. </p><hr class=""dividerBlock""><h2>Preliminaries</h2><p>Before I can explain either of the two measures, I must first introduce the language which allows me to precisely define each approach. Both impact measures have quite simple natural language descriptions, but it is easy to feel as though one is not getting the full story if it is explained using English alone. The specific way that the two methods are represented takes place within a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_decision_process"">Markov decision process</a> (MDP). </p><p>Intuitively, an MDP is just a way of representing actions that an agent can take in a stochastic environment, which is made up of a set of states. Formally, an MDP is defined by a tuple <span><style>.mjx-chtml {display: inline-block; line-height: 0; text-indent: 0; text-align: left; text-transform: none; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 100%; font-size-adjust: none; letter-spacing: normal; word-wrap: normal; word-spacing: normal; white-space: nowrap; float: none; direction: ltr; max-width: none; max-height: none; min-width: 0; min-height: 0; border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 1px 0}

The central insight was that these two ideas can be combined to avoid the downsides of either of them alone. </p><p>The idea behind <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1205.4810"">preserving reversibility</a> is simple. We don't want our artificial intelligence to do something that would make us unable to return things to the way that they were previously. For example, if we wanted the AI to create a waste disposal facility, we might not want it to irrevocably pollute a nearby lake in the process.</p><p>The way we formalize state reversibility is by first introducing a <em>reachability measure</em>. This reachability measure essentially takes in two states and returns 1 if there is some sequence of actions that the agent could take in order to go from the first state to the final state, and 0 if there is no such sequence of actions. But this is not yet the full description of the reachability measure. In order to take into account uncertainty in the environment, and a discount factor, reachability is actually defined as the following function of two states <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""x""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em;

In other words, if we are very close to the baseline state, then the penalty is close to zero (since reachability would be close to one).</p><p>The exact way that we define the baseline state is not particularly important for understanding a first pass through. Naively, the baseline could simply refer to the first step in the episode. It is, however, better to think about the baseline state as some type of reference world where the agent had done decided to do nothing. We can take this concept further by defining ""doing nothing"" as either a counterfactual reality where the agent was never turned on, or the result of an infinite sequence of nothing actions which began in the last time step. The second interpretation is preferred for a number of reasons, but this isn't crucially important for understanding relative reachability. (Read <a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01186.pdf"">the paper</a> for more details). </p><p>The problem with penalizing actions with the unreachability deviation is that it yields the maximum possible penalty for all actions which result in some irreversibility. This is clearly an issue in a complex environment, since all actions are in some sense irreversible. See section 2.2 in the paper for a specific toy example of why using mere unreachability won't work.</p><p>The contribution that Krakovna makes is by introducing a measure which is sensitive to the magnitude of irreversibility. Relative reachability is defined as the average reduction in reachability of all states from the current state compared to the baseline.

We are summing over all states in the environment, and taking a difference between the reachability between the baseline and our current state. This feels like we are determining how far we are from the set of all states in the environment that are close to the baseline. For some particularly irreversible action, relative reachability will assign a high penalty to this action because it reduced the reachability to all the states we could have been in if we had done nothing. The idea is that presumably we should not try to go into regions of the state space which will make it hard to set everything back to ""normal."" Conversely, we shouldn't enter states that would be hard to get to if we never did anything at all.</p><h2>Attainable utility</h2><p>Alexander Turner expanded upon relative reachability by generalizing it to reward functions rather than states. As I understand, it was not Turner's initial intention to create a general version of reachability, but the way that the two approaches ended up being similar allowed for a natural abstraction of both (see the section on Value-difference measures in the relative reachability paper). </p><p><em>Attainable utility</em> is the idea that, rather than caring about the average reduction of state reachability, we should instead care about the average reduction of <em>utility reachability</em>. The central insight guiding attainable utility is summed up nicely in a single sentence in his introductory post, <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yEa7kwoMpsBgaBCgb/towards-a-new-impact-measure"">Towards A New Impact Measure</a>. </p><blockquote> Impact is change to our ability to achieve goals.</blockquote><p>""Goals"" in this case refers to some set of arbitrary utility functions. They don't need to be <em>our</em> utility functions. They could instead be any sufficiently diverse set of utility functions. In the above post Turner uses the set of all computable utility functions weighted by their complexity. In general these reward functions are referred to as the <em>auxiliary set</em>. </p><p>There are a few ways that attainable utility has been represented formally.

Yesterday, I outlined a few notable critiques to impact measurements, such as incentives for keeping the universe in a stasis. Turner sought to <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/c2oM7qytRByv6ZFtz/impact-measure-desiderata"">outline a ton</a> of potential desiderata for impact measures, some of which were only discovered after realizing that other methods like <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/H7KB44oKoSjSCkpzL/worrying-about-the-vase-whitelisting"">whitelisting </a>were difficult to make work.</p><p>Among the desirable properties are some obvious ones that had already been recognized, like value-agnosticism, natural kind, and the measure being apparently rational. Turner contributed some new ones like dynamic consistency and efficiency, which allowed him to provide tests for his new approach. (It is interesting to compare the computational efficiency of calculating relative reachability and attainable utility).</p><p>Some people have disagreed with the significance of some items on the list, and turned to simpler frameworks. Rohin Shah <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/s8JuDTo8mTcbHMcLW/alignment-newsletter-25"">has added</a>,</p><blockquote>My main critique is that it's not clear to me that an AUP-agent would be able to do anything useful.  [...]</blockquote><blockquote>Generally, I think that it's hard to satisfy the conjunction of three desiderata -- objectivity (no dependence on values), safety (preventing any catastrophic plans) and non-trivialness (the AI is still able to do some useful things). </blockquote><p>By contrast Daniel Filan has compiled a list of test cases for <a href=""http://danielfilan.com/2019/02/06/impact_reg_test_cases.html"">impact measures</a>. While both the relative reachability paper and the paper describing attainable utility preservation provided tests on AI safety gridworld environments, it is not clear to me at the moment whether these are particularly significant. I am driven to study impact measurements mainly because of the force of intuitive arguments for each approach, rather than due to any specific empirical test.</p><p>The post <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/kCY9dYGLoThC3aG7w/best-reasons-for-pessimism-about-impact-of-impact-measures"">Best reasons for pessimism about impact of impact measures?</a> is the most comprehensive collection of critiques from the community. So far I have not been able to find any long-form rebuttals to the specific impact measurements. Instead, the best counterguments come from this post above.</p><p>In general there is a disagreement about the <em>aim</em> of impact measures, and how we could possibly apply them in a way that meaningfully helps align artificial intelligence. In the top reply from the ""Best reasons for pessimism"" post, lesswrong user <em><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/users/vaniver"">Vaniver</a> </em>is primarily concerned with our ability to reduce AI alignment into a set of individual issues such that impact measurements helps solve a particular one of these issues. </p><p>The state of the debate over impact measurement is best described as informal and scattered across many comments on Lesswrong and the Alignment Forum. </p><hr class=""dividerBlock""><p>In the next post I will continue my discussion of impact measures by providing what I view as finer grained intuitions for what I think impact measures are good for. This should hopefully provide some insight into what problem we can actually solve by taking this approach, and whether the current impact measures rise to the challenge. </p>",matthew-barnett,matthew-barnett,Matthew Barnett,

New researchers might even try to push capabilities research forward, to build career capital.  The best argument for this, IMO, is that someone else is probably going to do it if you don&#x27;t, likely within the next 6 months (given the current pace of research).</p><p>I mostly agree with this view, but I do still think a bit about effects of my research on capabilities, and think others should as well.  Being concerned about advancing capabilities has, in the past, moved me away from pursuing ambitious capabilities projects which might have been very good for my career if they paid off, but I always saw someone else do the thing I was considering soon afterwards anyways...</p><p><strong>But as far as I know, nobody has tried to evaluate this question thoroughly and systematically.</strong>  This is concerning, because it seems like current attitudes could plausibly be a result of motivated reasoning (i.e. &quot;I want to keep doing my research, and probably would do so even if I saw a compelling case against it&quot;) and groupthink (&quot;nobody else is worrying about this&quot;).  I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s really tractable, but I think it could be worth ~1-4 people spending a bit of time (possibly up to ~6-24 months, if it ends up looking tractable after some initial thought/investigation) on trying to do a fairly comprehensive treatment of this question.</p><p>The main deliverables could be practical guidelines for AI safety researchers, e.g.: </p><ul><li>Figuring out when it makes sense to be concerned about advancing AI capabilities via ones&#x27; research.</li><li>How to decide how significant those concerns are, and whether they should preclude working on that line of research or research project, or change the publication model for them.</li></ul><p>The project could intersect with current &quot;dual-use&quot; considerations (e.g. RE GPT-2).  </p><p>(also worth mentioning): I know MIRI now has secret research, and I think they have a reasonable case for that, since they aren&#x27;t in the mainstream paradigms.  I do think it would be good for them to have a &quot;hit publication&quot; within the ML community, and might be worth pushing some out-of-the-box ideas which might advance capabilities.  The reason is that MIRI has very little credibility, or even name recognition in the ML community, ATM, and I think it would be a big deal in terms of &quot;perception of AI safety concerns within the ML community&quot; if that changed.  And I think the ML communities perceptions are important, because the ML community&#x27;s attitude seems of critical importance for getting good Xrisk reduction policies in place (IIRC, I talked to someone at MIRI who disagreed with that perspective).</p><p>The idea to write this post came out of discussion with Joe Collman.</p><br/>",capybaralet,david-scott-krueger-formerly-capybaralet,David Scott Krueger (formerly: capybaralet),

For instance, in <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5gfqG3Xcopscta3st/building-up-to-an-internal-family-systems-model"">Building up to an Internal Family Systems model</a>, I used a toy model where different subagents cast votes to modify the contents of consciousness. One may conceptualize this as equivalent to the production system model, where different subagents implement different production rules which compete to modify the contents of consciousness.</p><p>In this post, I will flesh out the model a bit more, as well as applying it to a few other examples, such as emotion suppression, internal conflict, and blind spots.</p><h1>Evidence accumulation</h1><p>Dehaene has outlined his model in a pair of papers (Zylberberg, Dehaene, Roelfsema, &amp; Sigman, 2011; Dehaene &amp; Sigman, 2012), though he is not the first one to propose this kind of a model. Daniel Dennett&#x2019;s <em><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yex7E6oHXYL93Evq6/book-review-consciousness-explained"">Consciousness Explained</a> </em>(1991) also discusses consciousness as implementing a virtual Turing machine; both cite as examples earlier computational models of the mind, such as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soar_(cognitive_architecture)"">Soar</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT-R"">ACT</a>, which work on the same principles.</p><p>An important building block in Dehane&#x2019;s model is based on what we know about evidence accumulation and decision-making in the brain, so let&#x2019;s start by taking a look at that. </p><p>Sequential sampling models (SSMs) are a family of models from mathematical psychology that have been developed since the 1960s (Forstmann, Ratcliff, &amp; Wagenmakers, 2016). A particularly common SSM is the diffusion decision model (DDM) of decision-making, in which a decision-maker is assumed to noisily accumulate evidence towards a particular choice. Once the evidence in favor of a particular choice meets a decision threshold, that choice is taken.</p><p>For example, someone might be <a href=""https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch16.S1.html"">shown dots on a screen</a>, some of which are moving in a certain direction. The task is to tell which direction the dots are moving in. After the person has seen enough dot movements, they will have sufficient confidence to make their judgment. The difficulty of the task can be precisely varied by changing the proportion of moving dots and their speed, making the movement easier or harder to detect. One can then measure how such changes affect the time needed for people to make a judgment.&#xA0; </p><span><figure><img src=""https://stuff.kajsotala.fi/LW/Turing/DDM_.png"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:90%""></figure></span><p>A DDM is a simple model with just four parameters:</p><ul><li><em>decision threshold</em>: a threshold for the amount of evidence in favor of one option which causes that option to be chosen</li><li><em>starting point bias</em>: a person may start biased towards one particular alternative, which can be modeled by them having some initial evidence putting them closer to one threshold than the other</li><li><em>drift rate</em>: the average amount of evidence accumulated per time unit</li><li><em>non-decision time</em>: when measuring e.g. reaction times, a delay introduced by factors such as perceptual processing which take time but are not involved in the decision process itself</li></ul><p>These parameters can be measured from behavioral experiments, and the model manages to fit a wide variety of behavioral experiments and intuitive phenomena well (Forstmann et al., 2016; Ratcliff, Smith, Brown, &amp; McKoon, 2016; Roberts &amp; Hutcherson, 2019). For example, easier-to-perceive evidence in favor of a particular option is reflected in a faster drift rate towards the decision threshold, causing faster decisions. On the other hand, making mistakes or being falsely told that one&#x2019;s performance on a trial is below that of most other participants prompts caution, increasing people&#x2019;s decision thresholds and slowing down response times (Roberts &amp; Hutcherson, 2019). </p><p>While the models have been studied the most in the context of binary decisions, one can easily extend the model to a choice between <em>n</em> alternatives by assuming the existence of multiple accumulators, each accumulating decision towards their own choice, possibly inhibiting the others in the process. Neuroscience studies have identified structures which seem to correspond to various parts of SSMs. For example, in random dot motion tasks, where participants have to indicate the direction that dots on a screen are moving in,</p><blockquote>the firing rates of direction selective neurons in the visual cortex (area MT/V5) exhibit a roughly linear increase (or decrease) as a function of the strength of motion in their preferred (or anti-preferred) direction. The average firing rate from a pool of neurons sharing similar direction preferences provides a time varying signal that can be compared to an average of another, opposing pool. This difference can be positive or negative, reflecting the momentary evidence in favor of one direction and against the other. (Shadlen &amp; Shohamy, 2016)</blockquote><p>Shadlen &amp; Shohamy (2016) note that experiments on more &#x201C;real-world&#x201D; decisions, such as decisions on which stock to pick or which snack to choose, also seem to be compatible with an SSM framework. However, this raises a few questions. For instance, it makes intuitive sense why people would take more time on a random motion task when they lose confidence: watching the movements for a longer time accumulates more evidence for the right answer, until the decision threshold is met. But what is the additional evidence that is being accumulated in the case of making a decision based on subjective value?</p><p>The authors make an analogy to a symbol task which has been studied in rhesus monkeys. The monkeys need to decide between two choices, one of which is correct. For this task, they are shown a series of symbols, each of which predicts one of the choices as being correct with some probability. Through experience, the monkeys come to learn the weight of evidence carried by each symbol. In effect, they are accumulating evidence not by motion discrimination but memory retrieval: retrieving some pre-learned association between a symbol and its assigned weight. This &#x201C;leads to an incremental change in the firing rate of LIP neurons that represent the cumulative [likelihood ratio] in favor of the target&quot;.</p><p>The proposal is that humans make choices based on subjective value using a similar process: by perceiving a possible option and then retrieving memories which carry information about the value of that option. For instance, when deciding between an apple and a chocolate bar, someone might recall how apples and chocolate bars have tasted in the past, how they felt after eating them, what kinds of associations they have about the healthiness of apples vs. chocolate, any other emotional associations they might have (such as fond memories of their grandmother&#x2019;s apple pie) and so on. </p><p>Shadlen &amp; Shohamy further hypothesize that the reason why the decision process seems to take time is that different pieces of relevant information are found in physically disparate memory networks and neuronal sites. Access from the memory networks to the evidence accumulator neurons is physically bottlenecked by a limited number of &#x201C;pipes&#x201D;. Thus, a number of different memory networks need to take turns in accessing the pipe, causing a serial delay in the evidence accumulation process.</p><span><figure><img src=""https://stuff.kajsotala.fi/LW/Turing/subjective.png"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:93%""></figure></span><br><h1>The biological Turing machine</h1><p>In <em>Consciousness and the Brain, </em>Dehaene considers the example of doing arithmetic. Someone who is calculating something like 12 * 13 in their head, might first multiply 10 by 12, keep the result in memory, multiply 3 by 12, and then add the results together. Thus, if a circuit in the brain has learned to do multiplication, consciousness can be used to route its results to a temporary memory storage, with those results then being routed from the storage to a circuit that does addition.</p><p>Production systems in AI are composed of if-then rules (production rules) which modify the contents of memory: one might work by detecting the presence of an item like &#x201C;10 * 12&#x201D; and rewriting it as &#x201C;120&#x201D;. On a conceptual level, the brain is proposed to do something similar: various contents of consciousness activate neurons storing something like production rules, which compete to fire. The first one to fire gets to apply its production, changing the contents of consciousness.</p><p>If I understand Deheane&#x2019;s model correctly, he proposes to apply the neural mechanisms discussed in the previous sections - such as neuron groups which accumulate evidence towards some kind of decision - at a slightly lower level. In the behavioral experiments, there are mechanisms which accumulate evidence towards which particular physical actions to take, but a person might still be distracted by unrelated thoughts while performing that task. Dehaene&#x2019;s papers look at the kinds of mechanisms choosing <em>what thoughts to think</em>. That is, there are accumulator neurons which take &#x201C;actions&#x201D; to modify the contents of consciousness and working memory.</p><p>We can think of this as a two-stage process:</p><ol><li>A process involving subconscious &#x201C;decisions&#x201D; about what thoughts to think, and what kind of content to maintain in consciousness. Evidence indicating the kind of conscious content is most suited for the situation is in part based on hardwired priorities, and in part stored associations about the kinds of thoughts that previously produced beneficial results.</li><li>A higher-level process involving decisions about what physical actions to take. While the inputs to this process <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/x4n4jcoDP7xh5LWLq/book-summary-consciousness-and-the-brain#Unconscious_processing_of_meaning"">do not necessarily need to go through consciousness, consciously perceived evidence has a much higher weight</a>. Thus, the lower-level process has significant influence on which evidence gets to the accumulators on this level.</li></ol><p>To be clear, this does not necessarily correspond to two clearly distinct levels: Zylberberg, Dehaene, Roelfsema, &amp; Sigman (2011) do not talk about there being any levels, and they suggest that &#x201C;triggering motor actions&#x201D; is one of the possible decisions involved. But their paper seems to mostly be focused on actions - or, in their language, production rules - which manipulate the contents of consciousness. </p><p>There seems to me to be a conceptual difference between the kinds of actions that change the contents of consciousness, and the kinds of actions which accumulate evidence over many items <em>in</em> consciousness (such as iterative memories of snacks). Zylberberg et al. talk about a &#x201C;winner-take-all race&#x201D; to trigger a production rule, which to me implies that the evidence accumulated in favor of each production rule is cleared each time that the contents of consciousness is changed. This is seemingly incompatible with accumulating evidence over many consciousness-moments, so postulating a two-level distinction between accumulators seems like a straightforward way of resolving the issue.</p><p><em>[EDIT: <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/FEDNY4DLMpRSE3Jsr/neural-basis-for-global-workspace-theory#Basal_Ganglia__BG__and__Action__Selection"">Hazard suggests</a> that the two-level split is implemented by the basal ganglia carrying out evidence accumulation across changes in conscious content.]</em></p><p>As an aside, I am, as Dehaene is, treating consciousness and working memory as basically synonymous for the purposes of this discussion. This is not strictly correct; e.g. there may be items in working memory which are not currently conscious. However, since it&#x2019;s generally thought that items in working memory need to be actively rehearsed <em>through</em> consciousness in order to avoid be maintained, I think that this equivocation is okay for these purposes.</p><p>Here&#x2019;s a conceptual overview of the stages in the &#x201C;biological Turing machine&#x2019;s&#x201D; operation (as Zylberberg et al. note, a production firing &#x201C;is essentially equivalent to the action performed by a Turing machine in a single step&#x201D;):</p><h2>1. The production selection stage</h2><span><figure><img src=""https://stuff.kajsotala.fi/LW/Turing/Turing1.png"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:40%""></figure></span><p>At the beginning of a cognitive cycle, a person&#x2019;s working memory contains a number of different items, some internally generated (e.g. memories, thoughts) and some external (e.g. the sight or sound of something in the environment). Each item in memory may activate (contribute evidence to) neurons which accumulate weight towards triggering a particular kind of production rule. When some accumulator neurons reach their decision threshold, they apply their associated production rule.</p><p>In the above image, the blue circles at the bottom represent active items in working memory. Two items are activating the same group of accumulator neurons (shown red) and one is activating an unrelated one (shown brown).</p><h3>2. Production rule ignition</h3><span><figure><img src=""https://stuff.kajsotala.fi/LW/Turing/Turing2.png"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:40%""></figure></span><p>Once a group of accumulator neurons reach their decision threshold and fire a production rule,  the model suggests that there are a number of things that the rule can do. In the above image, an active rule is modifying the contents of working memory: taking one of the blue circles, deleting it, and creating a new blue circle nearby. Hypothetically, this might be something like taking the mental objects holding &#x201C;120&#x201D; and &#x201C;36&#x201D;, adding them together, and storing the output of &#x201C;156&#x201D; in memory.</p><p>Obviously, since we are talking about brains, expressions like &quot;writing into memory&quot; or &quot;deleting from memory&quot; need to be understood in somewhat different terms than in computers; something being &#x201C;deleted from working memory&#x201D; mostly just means that a neuronal group which was storing the item in its firing pattern stops doing so.</p><p>The authors suggest that among other things, production rules can:</p><ul><li>trigger motor actions (e.g. saying or doing something)</li><li>change the contents of working memory to trigger a new processing step (e.g. saving the intermediate stage of an arithmetic operation, together with the intention to proceed with the next step)</li><li>activate and broadcast information that is in a &#x201C;latent&#x201D; state (e.g. retrieving a memory and sending it to consciousness)</li><li>activate peripheral processors capable of performing specific functions (e.g. changing the focus of attention)</li></ul><h2>3. New production selection</h2><span><figure><img src=""https://stuff.kajsotala.fi/LW/Turing/Turing3.png"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:40%""></figure></span><p>After the winning production rule has been applied, the production selection phase begins anew. At this stage <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/XYYyzgyuRH5rFN64K/what-makes-people-intellectually-active#pMvL4xCcntDk8oZbb"">or a future one</a>, some kind of a credit assignment process likely modifies the decision weights involved in choosing production rules: if a particular rule was activated in particular circumstances and seemed to produce positive consequences, then the connections which caused those circumstances to be considered evidence for that rule are strengthened.</p><h1>Practical relevance</h1><p>Okay, so why do we care? What is the practical relevance of this model?</p><p>First, this helps make some of my previous posts more concrete. In <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5gfqG3Xcopscta3st/building-up-to-an-internal-family-systems-model"">Building up to an Internal Family Systems model</a>, I proposed some sort of a process where different subagents were competing to change the contents of consciousness. For instance, &#x201C;manager&#x201D; subagents might be trying to manipulate the contents of consciousness so as to avoid unpleasant thoughts and to keep the person out of dangerous circumstances.</p><p>People who do IFS, or other kinds of &#x201C;parts work&#x201D;, will notice that different subagents are associated with different kinds of bodily sensations and flavors of consciousness. A priori, there shouldn&#x2019;t be any particular reason for this&#x2026; except, perhaps, if the strength of such sensations correlated with the activation of a particular subagent, with those sensations then being internally used for credit assignment to identify and reward subagents which had been active in a given cognitive cycle. (This is mostly pure speculation, but supported by some observations to which I hope to return in a future post.)</p><p>In my original post, I mostly talked about exiles - neural patterns blocked from consciousness by other subagents - as being subagents related to a painful memory. But while it is not emphasized as much, IFS holds that other subagents can in principle be exiled too. For example, a subagent which tends to react using anger may frequently lead to harmful consequences, and then be blocked by other subagents. This can easily be modeled using the neural Turing machine framework: over time, the system learns decisions which modify consciousness so as to prevent the activation of a production rule that gives power to the angry subagent. As this helps avoid harmful consequences, this begins to happen more and more often.</p><p>Hazard has a <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/qmXqHKpgRfg83Nif9/how-to-ignore-your-emotions-while-also-thinking-you-re"">nice recent post</a> of this kind of a thing happening with emotions in general:</p><blockquote>So young me is upset that the grub master for our camping trip forgot half the food on the menu, and all we have for breakfast is milk. I couldn&apos;t &quot;fix it&quot; given that we were in the woods, so my next option was &quot;stop feeling upset about it.&quot; So I reached around in the dark of my mind, and Oops, the &quot;healthily process feelings&quot; lever is right next to the &quot;stop listening to my emotions&quot; lever.</blockquote><blockquote>The end result? &quot;Wow, I decided to stop feeling upset, and then I stopped feeling upset. I&apos;m so fucking good at emotional regulation!!!!!&quot;</blockquote><blockquote>My model now is that I substituted &quot;is there a monologue of upsetness in my conscious mental loop?&quot; for &quot;am I feeling upset?&quot;. So from my perspective, it just felt like I was very in control of my feelings. Whenever I wanted to stop feeling something, I could. When I thought of ignoring/repressing emotions, I imagined trying to cover up something that was there, maybe with a story. Or I thought if you poked around ignored emotions there would be a response of anger or annoyance. I at least expected that if I was ignoring my emotions, that if I got very calm and then asked myself, &quot;Is there anything that you&apos;re feeling?&quot; I would get an answer.</blockquote><blockquote>Again, the assumption was, &quot;If it&apos;s in my mind, I should be able to notice if I look.&quot; This ignored what was actually happening, which was that I was cutting the phone lines so my emotions couldn&apos;t talk to me in the first place.</blockquote><p>Feeling upset feels bad, ceasing to feel upset feels good. Brain notices that there is some operation which causes the feeling of upset to disappear from consciousness: carrying out this operation also produces a feeling of satisfaction in the form of &#x201C;yay, I&#x2019;m good at emotional regulation!&#x201D;. As a result of being rewarded, it eventually becomes so automatic as to block even <em>hints</em> of undesired emotions, making the block in question impossible to notice.</p><p>Another observation is that in IFS as well as in <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/mQmx4kQQtHeBip9ZC/internal-double-crux"">Internal Double Crux</a>, an important mental move seems to be &#x201C;giving subagents a chance to finish talking&#x201D;. For instance, subagent A might hold a consideration pointing in a particular direction, while subagent B holds a consideration in the opposite direction. When A starts presenting its points, B interrupts with its own point; in response, A interrupts with <em>its</em> point. It seems to be possible to commit to not taking a decision before having heard both subagents, and having done that, ask them to take turns presenting their points and not interrupt each other. What exactly is going on here?</p><p>Suppose that a person is contemplating the decision, &#x201C;should I trust my friend to have my back in a particular risky venture&#x201D;. Subagent A holds the consideration &#x201C;allies are important, and we don&#x2019;t have any, we should really trust our friend so that we would have more allies&#x201D;. Subagent B holds the consideration &#x201C;being betrayed would be really bad, and our friend seems untrustworthy, it&#x2019;s important that we don&#x2019;t sign up for this&#x201D;. Subagent A considers it <em>really important</em> to go on this venture together; subagent B considers it <em>really important</em> <strong>not</strong> to.</p><p>Recall that human decision-making happens by accumulating evidence towards different choices, until a decision threshold is met. If A were allowed to present its evidence in favor of signing up on the venture, that might sway the decision over the threshold before B was able to present the evidence against. Thus, there is a mechanism which allows B to &#x201C;interrupt&#x201D; A, in order to present its own evidence. Unfortunately, it is now A which risks B&#x2019;s evidence being sufficient to meet a decision threshold prematurely unless <em>B</em> is prevented from presenting its evidence, so A must interrupt. </p><p>Subjectively, this is experienced as intense internal conflict, with two extreme considerations pushing in opposite directions, allowing no decision to be made - unless there is a plausible commitment to <em>not </em>making a decision until both have been heard out. (To me, this feels like my attention being caught in a tug-of-war between one set of considerations versus another. Roberts &amp; Hutcherson (2019) note that <em>A large body of work suggests that negative information draws focus through rapid detection [64&#x2013;68] and attentional capture [69&#x2013;71]. [....] Several studies now show that attending to a choice alternative or attribute increases its weighting in the evidence accumulation process [72&#x2013;75]. To the extent that negative affect draws attention to a choice-relevant attribute or object, it should thus increase the weight it receives.</em>)</p><p>There&#x2019;s one more important consideration. Eliezer has written about <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/2MD3NMLBPCqPfnfre/cached-thoughts"">cached thoughts</a> - beliefs which we have once acquired, then never re-evaluated and just acted on them from that onwards. But this model suggests that things may be worse: it&#x2019;s not just that we are running on cached thoughts. Instead, <em>even the pre-conscious mechanisms deciding which thoughts are worth re-evaluating are running on cached values. </em></p><p>Sometimes external evidence may be sufficient to force an update, but there can also be self-fulfilling blind spots. For instance, you may note that negative emotions never even surface into your consciousness. This observation then triggers a sense of satisfaction about being good at emotional regulation, so that thoughts about alternative - and less pleasant - hypotheses are never selected for consideration. In fact, evidence to the contrary may feel actively unpleasant to consider, triggering subagents which use feelings such as annoyance - or if annoyance would be too suspicious, just plain indifference - to push that evidence out of consciousness, before it can contribute to a decision.</p><p>And the older those flawed assumptions are, the more time there is for additional structures to <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NQgWL7tvAPgN2LTLn/spaghetti-towers"">build on top of them</a>.</p><p><em>This post is part of research funded by the <a href=""https://foundational-research.org"">Foundational Research Institute</a>.

The layer counter-acts the emergent incentive of advanced agents to resist such alteration.<br/><br/>A detailed model for agents which can reason about preserving their utility function is developed, and used to prove that the corrigibility layer works as intended in a large set of non-hostile universes.  The corrigible agents have an emergent incentive to protect key elements of their corrigibility layer. However, hostile universes may contain forces strong enough to break safety features.  Some open problems related to graceful degradation when an agent is successfully attacked are identified.<br/><br/>The results in this paper were obtained by concurrently developing an AGI agent simulator, an agent model, and proofs.  The simulator is available under an open source license. The paper contains simulation results which illustrate the safety related properties of corrigible AGI agents in detail.<br/></em><br/>This post can be used for comments and questions.<br/><br/>The paper contains several results and observations that do not rely on the heavy use of math, but other key results and discussions are quite mathematical.  Feel to post questions and comments even if you have not read all the mathematical parts.<br/><br/>As this is my first post on LessWrong, and my first paper on AGI safety, I feel I should say something to introduce myself.  I have a Ph.D. in software design, but my professional life so far has been very diverse and multidisciplinary. Among other things I have been an experimental physicist, a standards developer and negotiator, an Internet privacy advocate, a wireless networking expert, and a systems architect in an industrial research lab.  So I bring a wide range of tools and methodological traditions to the field.  What made me interested in the field of AGI safety in particular is that it seems to have open problems where real progress can be made using mathematical techniques that I happen to like. I am currently on a sabbatical: basically this means that I decided to quit my day job, and to use my savings to work for a while on some interesting problems that are different from the interesting problems I worked on earlier.</p>",Koen.Holtman,koen-holtman,Koen.Holtman,

[<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinism"">1</a>]  In deterministic terms you cannot have an event <em><strong>E</strong></em> if you didn&#x27;t have an event <em><strong>D</strong></em> before, which in turn is the result of a cause <em><strong>C</strong></em> and so on, without any type of  alphabetical  bound.  This philosophical conception is one of the most discussed, directly or indirectly, because it is the generator of very important ontological implications, first of all the existence of free will which, we could claim, is one of the  most courted topics by the philosophers of all time. Something that has always struck me about the endless debates on the subject it is a simple logical flaw that people seem to commit when they put forward their arguments, both for and against determinism. This (ir)rational weakness lies in the very concept core of determinism itself and, for simplicity, I will call it the &quot;<em>What if </em>?&quot; problem. It goes like this: </p><ul><li>&quot; <em>If determinism is true, then should criminals be persecuted for their crimes </em>? &quot;</li><li>&quot; <em>If determinism is true, then should science cease to exists </em>? &quot;</li><li>&quot; <em>Why, if determinism is true, do we look carefully before crossing the road</em> ? &quot;</li><li>&quot; <em>If determinism is true why should I do anything</em> ? &quot;</li></ul><p> I think you got the point.                                                                                                             Now, questions like these can be found in countless publications, online blog discussions, talk with friends on a drug-induced Friday night and they generally give way to endless verbosity flows, some of which may also contain angular viewpoints that shed new lights on your beliefs.  So far so beautiful, too bad all these intellectual disputes are inconsistent with the very premise of determinism.  Think of the first question, the only correct answer is: </p><ul><li>&quot;I<em>f determinism is true, criminals will continue to commit crimes and we will condemn them for this, we could not change our way of acting because otherwise it would not be determinism.&quot;</em>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </li></ul><p>The second answer is a reflection of this and also the third. In fact, this answer is a blueprint for every possible observation to such questions which, notice well, make up a good 95% of the total discussions on the material. The same errors are dragged by induction into the reasoning on any type or by-product of the main theme.  <br/>For example, I remember a post on reddit in which a user wondered if, taken as assumption the veracity of eternalism (block universe determinism [<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternalism_(philosophy_of_time)"">2</a>]), then it would have been more ethically appropriate for human beings to stop having children because you know, life is unfair and in this way those poor beings would suffer forever. To this my answer was the following:   </p><ul><li>&quot;<em>If eternalism is true nothig is created. Everything already exist. You fail to see it from a 4D perspective. Everything is already arranged, begginning to end, every state of matter, every permutation of it all. There is no movement, no action, no intention</em>. &quot;  </li></ul><p> You can observe a certain isomorphism between this answer and the one given above. If you want to explore these concepts (eternalism and its philosophical, physical and ethical implications) in a baroque, literary fascination, I strongly recommend the monumental novel Jerusalem by Alan Moore [<a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38246560-jerusalem"">3</a>]. Nowadays science has not yet succeeded in proving the existence of a single random natural source and even if quantum physics seems to put sticks in the wheels of determinism, my personal belief is in line with that of nobel prize Gerard &#x27;t Hooft [<a href=""https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerardus_%27t_Hooft"">4</a>] , which hypothesizes that there may be a mechanistic structure at the base of everything, of which quantum physics is nothing more than an emergent property that we do not yet fully understand [<a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02874"">5</a>][<a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.1548"">6</a>]. However, the thesis of this post is not to affirm the existence of determinism, the thesis, to make it short, is to affirm that determinism (in all its spectrum of forms) is a sort of <u>ontological cul-de-sac</u>.                                      I don&#x27;t think we will ever be able to design experiments, physical or psychological, that can prove or disprove it, let alone arrive at a solution through the tools of logical investigation. <u>The existence of determinism could very well be an undecidable problem</u>. Psychological studies have already been conducted, showing that people who believe in determinism are less productive, flirt more easily with depression and have a more creaky morality than others but these studies (and consequently the results) fall into the same categorical errors analyzed above. <u>If everything is carved in the marble of time, we cannot change things in any way and people who believe in stochastic salvation do it because they cannot do otherwise and are (generally) more serene because they cannot do otherwise.</u> In essence, in my opinion, it is impossible to determine whether a system is deterministic or not from within the system itself. Determinism, as a concept, can develop  the same sometimes annoying and sometimes fascinating self-referentiality of the halting problem.</p><br/><br/><br/><br/>",yamar69,yamar69,aiiixiii,

It was spinning too fast while arming (like how helicopters spin up before they took off), but nothing we tried would fix it. Eventually, I changed the PWM value back to the default value, and it spun up even faster.

The pain was horrible, but the nausea was worse. I had made everyone apple pie that day, but I didn’t get to keep my piece. </p><p>The doctor thought I needed facial reconstruction surgery, so they put me in an ambulance and shipped me to another hospital. They stitched me up, said no facial surgery was needed, but that my lens and iris were destroyed in my left eye. A couple days later, my <u><a href=""https://imgur.com/slPamum"">eye<em>ball</em> bruised</a></u>. A week of checkups and eye drops 4 times a day, they then put me under for surgery. </p><p>I woke up in so much pain, so confused. They told me to keep my head down. I asked <em>Why am I in so much pain? </em>repeatedly. They put me in a wheelchair to take me outside, and told me to keep my head down. But all I could do was feel terrified because <em>I was in pain and no one was doing anything about it.</em> I’m told to keep my head down as they put me in my dad’s car, so I kept my head down and hurt. </p><p>For a week, I had to keep my head down.

I couldn’t play piano like I used to because of my arm. I couldn’t read like I used to because of my eye. I couldn’t even think like I used to because my working memory was shot. I felt so powerless and isolated.</p><p>How am I supposed to program or learn new things when I could barely keep 3 things on my mind, when I could barely read off a screen for 2 minutes before having to take a break? How am I supposed to connect with someone when I could barely look them in the eye, when I couldn’t even give them my full attention?</p><p>On top of that, I was on eye drops to sooth my eye from all the <em>other</em> eye drops I was taking. I was on laxatives to relieve constipation from all the pain medicine I was taking. Even though I was on a tablet and two drops for eye pressure, I still got glaucoma headaches. So another surgery, and more checkups. And of course, there were the panic attacks. </p><p>Any unexpected loud noise would fill me with distress, it felt like I was being attacked, like <em>it was happening again. </em>A couple of months later, I was playing piano more like I was used to. A picture frame on top of the piano fell, freaked me out, and I cried because <em>I thought I was over this</em>. It was frustrating how scared I was, how easily I could feel overwhelmed.  </p><p>I’ve never been angrier in my life.</p><hr class=""dividerBlock""><p>As a kid, I used to think “what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger”, that if I went through horrible events, I would come out cooler, more mature. That I would be like <a href=""https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Sasuke_Uchiha"">Sasuke</a> from Naruto whose whole family died, but he came out so cool, and edgy, and he got the girl! But really, horrible events mess you up, and I wouldn’t wish that on anyone. There’s not a guarantee that things will be better, not even that things will be as good as they were before.</p><p>But... things did get better. </p><h1>Meditation</h1><p>I read <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/eZezBzp7JnevBNAkj/starting-meditation"">Hazard’s post</a></u> and took up meditating with the mind illuminated. I took Elo up on <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4ciy6PCDWfGCxqHez/attacking-enlightenment"">talking about meditating</a></u>, told him about my panic attacks, and we fixed them! By “fixed” I mean they still happened, but drastically affected me less and less. And then they started happening less and less. Now, I really don’t mind them more than an itch.</p><p>I was told:</p><ol type=""1""><li>Break down previous panic attacks into a sequence of events/sensations such as physical sensations (jaws clenching, shoulders tensed, heart racing, breathing change), and mental sensations (specific thoughts, movements of attention, loss of awareness).</li><li>Be aware of the sensations you experience during the actual panic attack. From Elo, “The piece of knowledge to maintain is that you are not these reactions, you have them but they do not have you. You get to watch them happen.”</li></ol><p>For me, I could see “jerking back, elevated heart rate, cortisol/adrenaline feeling, teary eyed because of how I reacted, eyes focus, shoulder tension, toes clenching”, but later, in the moment of actually having a panic attack, it was [noise]-&gt;[involuntary yelp]-&gt;[chest tightness with stress]-&gt;[eyes widen]-&gt;[thinking that I’m fine]. </p><p>I would like to clarify that “chest tightness with stress” is a mental object in word form, but I felt it as a physical sensation like a bad warmth spreading through my body starting from my chest. But even that description fails to convey the reality of the sensation! What’s important is that I described it to myself in hard-to-convey physical sensations. The same is true for the other links in the chain. </p><p>Doing this, I realized “Pain is inevitable; suffering is optional” with the next few panic attacks. They happened. They sucked...but then they were over. Through meditating I was building this skill even more, this skill of non-reacting, of accepting the reality of sensations exactly as they were, of not fighting it, of not getting trapped in a series of thoughts, of not holding on to impulses. I used to think “Man, I’m so hungry”. Now it’s, “Oh the sensation of hunger is there. Oh, now it’s gone. What time is it? 11:00? I’ll work another hour and then eat”. All that miserable anger that would keep me up at nights, I've now let it all go. </p><p>I wish I would’ve had a consistent meditation practice before the accident. I predict that I would’ve suffered much less. If you are going through a difficult life trauma  now, I highly recommend getting professional help, and you’re welcome to PM me about it as well. </p><h1>A Cool Scar </h1><p>I can read and think like I used to (which were two of the most debilitating effects).

<blockquote>
<p>A culture that cannot tell the difference between ""reporting"" and ""doxing"" and merely considers it ""doxing"" when <em>they</em> do it, is a culture that cannot accurately talk about behavior anymore. It's a culture where the words have been spun so much, that they have lost their objective meaning, and are now instead used more interchangeably to deliver more subjective messages. It's also a culture where not enough people feel the <em>need</em> to define their words, and to actually figure out what counts as reporting, as gossiping, as doxing, because this way the words can be used strategically in the moment, without having to be fully consistent with next time.</p>

Searle compared a computer’s actions with those of a technician whose job it is to respond to messages presented in some unfamiliar script. The technician consults a list of procedures and executes some prescribed action. Searle thought that the actions of a computer were necessarily comparable to those of the technician, denying that any understanding was taking place.</p><p>I want to challenge Searle’s contention by arguing that his assumptions about the capabilities of a general intelligence are far too stunted. </p><hr class=""dividerBlock""/><p>Humans start off life just like the technician;  confronted with a stream of nearly incoherent inputs (unintelligible sound waves, patterns of light and dark; or, alternatively: neural activity). In a sense, we are worse off, since we initially don’t have much of a repertoire of procedures to guide our behaviour. But we do have one advantage. Namely, the ability to learn. </p><p>A baby tries first one thing, then another, receiving uninterrupted feedback from his environment. With experience, the newborn learns the importance of context: it mostly pays off to reach into the cookie bag, but not when there are signs of a hungry animal inside. </p><p>What is our baby doing in his explorations? He is building a complex control system, with a dense matrix of inhibitory and activating responses. When the control system reaches a certain arbitrary threshold, we say our (no longer) baby has achieved intelligence. </p><p>Now come back to the technician/computer program. Instead of having him rely slavishly on a list of procedures, let’s have him initially respond to assignments on the basis of some bare heuristics. In response to a request, he initiates some behaviour and is rewarded or punished. He takes note of the effects, as well as the context, and sets up hypotheses accounting for the outcomes. This is all within the range of possibilities for computer programs. </p><p>Our technician continues refining his hypothesis and, over time, gets quite good at obtaining rewards and avoiding punishments. An advisor could speed the process by getting him to correct his hypotheses. But, given enough experience, the technician is able to perfect his skills on his own. </p><p>Has our technician mastered Chinese? Absolutely! If you’ll don’t agree, tell me what you think is still missing.</p><p>Just like a human, the computer program achieves intelligence once it passes some threshold of complexity in successfully navigating its environment. Intelligence is a matter of the range and density of his hypothesis. It has nothing to do with its realisation in a biological organism. </p><p>Why is Searle’s Chinese Room so persuasive and how did it fool people for so long? Searle rigged his analogy to in two important ways: </p><p>- He inappropriately treats intelligence as a discrete variable, then assumes an extremely narrow range of inputs and outputs where learning is impossible. </p><p>- He plays upon normal human anxieties about being compared with an inanimate object, scaring potential critics from questioning his analogy. </p>",Jimdrix_Hendri,jimdrix_hendri,Jimdrix_Hendri,

It&#x27;s not that I didn&#x27;t initially believe in evolution or understand natural selection, but it&#x27;s just that I didn&#x27;t really understand the full breadth of the evidence and predictions that the theory makes. Before, I had a tendency to simply assert that &quot;the evidence is overwhelming&quot; in discussions without really going into detail. </p><p>When I began researching evidence, I had a few choices. I could just read basic surface arguments that I found on the internet, such as <a href=""https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/her/evolution-and-natural-selection/a/lines-of-evidence-for-evolution"">this article</a> from Khan academy or the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence_of_common_descent"">Wikipedia page</a>. While these resources are valuable, they aren&#x27;t very comprehensive, and don&#x27;t appear like they&#x27;d convince a hard-nosed skeptic. There are popular books, such as Jerry A. Coyne&#x27;s <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Why-Evolution-True-Jerry-Coyne/dp/0143116649"">Why Evolution Is True</a> and Richard Dawkins&#x27; <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Greatest-Show-Earth-Evidence-Evolution/dp/1416594795"">The Greatest Show on Earth</a>. The last two sources left me feeling like I still wasn&#x27;t getting the full story, since they assumed a beginner background in philosophy and science, and weren&#x27;t as nuanced as I wanted them to be (although I did not read both of them cover to cover). </p><p>Eventually I stumbled across <a href=""http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/comdesc/"">29+ Evidences for Macroevolution: <em>The Scientific Case for Common Descent</em></a> by Douglas Theobald, which exceeded my expectations, and satisfied my desire to understand the evidence for common descent. While this last work does not assume the reader is a professional biologist, it also doesn&#x27;t shy away from presenting specific technical evidences and the context they play in modern biology. </p><p>I wonder whether there is a similar publication which can satisfy my desire to understand anthropogentic climate change. My prior is that climate change is real, and primarily caused by human activity. I believe this because I generally side with the scientific consensus, and most intelligent people I know believe it. However, I am a little embarrassed from the fact that I couldn&#x27;t really convincingly argue with a skeptic. I imagine a highly educated climate change skeptic like <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Spencer_(scientist)"">Roy Spencer</a> could argue circles around me, which is never a good sign.</p><p>In light of the previous discussion, what are the best resources for understanding the full breadth of evidence for anthropogenic climate change?</p>",matthew-barnett,matthew-barnett,Matthew Barnett,

Armstrong proposed various ways that we could measure the difference between worlds, incorporate this information into a probability distribution, and then use that to compare actions. </p><p>Notably, this post put a lot of emphasis on comparing specific ontology-dependent variables between worlds in a way that is highly sensitive to our representation.

The AI would then be incentivized to keep these variables as close possible to what they would have been in the counterfactual where the AI had never done anything at all. </p><p>The flaw with this specific approach was immediately pointed out, both by Armstrong, and in the comments below. Eliezer Yudkowsky objected to the approach since it implied that some artificial intelligence would try to manage the state of affairs of the entire universe in order to keep the state of the world to be identical to the counterfactual where the AI never existed,</p><blockquote>Coarse-grained impact measures end with the AI deploying massive-scale nanotech in order to try and cancel out butterfly effects and force the world onto a coarse-grained path as close as possible to what it would&#x27;ve had if the AI &quot;hadn&#x27;t existed&quot; however that counterfactual was defined. [...] giving an AI a huge penalty function over the world to minimize seems like an obvious recipe for building something that will exert lots and lots of power. </blockquote><p>I agree that this is an issue with the way that the impact measure was defined — in particular, the way that it depended on some metric comparing worlds. However, the last line sounds a bit silly to me. If your impact measure provides an artificial intelligence an incentive to &quot;exert lots and lots of power&quot; then it doesn&#x27;t really sound like an impact measure at all. </p><p>This critique is expanded in Yudkowsky&#x27;s Arbital article which came out four years later, which I also go into below.</p><h2><a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.10720.pdf"">Low Impact Artificial Intelligences</a>, by Stuart Armstrong and Benjamin Levinstein (2015)</h2><p>This work starts from fundamentally the same starting point as the Lesswrong post above, but expands upon it by having more explicit and rigorous approaches. </p><p>One approach outlined in the article is the approach of viewing impact as a form of news which informs us of the world that we are living in. </p><p>The idea is simple enough: if you were notified tomorrow that Deepmind had constructed an advanced superintelligence, this would rightfully change the way that you thought about the world, and would inform you that some radical things are soon arriving which could alter the trajectory of what we value. Putting an emphasis on importance and the value of information forms the intuition behind this method of measuring impact. This also enables us to look at importance by putting us in the shoes of an agent which is given information.</p><blockquote>How would we measure importance? One approach is to look at a large set U of different utility functions, and check that knowing X makes little expected difference for any of them. </blockquote><p>In other words, conditional on the action taking place, how does this affect utility?</p><p>A concept which neighbors this approach is to imagine that impact is a measure of how detectable an action is. Presumably, the exact way that hydrogen atoms are distributed throughout the center of the sun shouldn&#x27;t affect the impact measure very much, since their arrangement gives us pretty much no actionable information here on Earth. Consequently, knowing a lot about the particular way that atoms in the sun are arranged doesn&#x27;t change what we predict will happen in the world — at least unless you are so powerful that it allows you to simulate the entire universe flawlessly, and feeds into the final input into this simulation.</p><p>By shifting the focus from particle positions and state representations, this paper gets closer to the way that I personally interpret impact measurement, and how I understand impact is defined in more recent research. </p><p>The paper moves then towards describing very abstract ways of measuring impact, including measuring general changes in probability distributions, such as some generalized cross-entropy between two probability distributions. The intuition here is that worlds with a low-impact artificial intelligence will have a broad probability distribution, whereas worlds with high-impact artificial intelligence will have almost all the probability density on a specific narrow region. If we could somehow measure the divergence between these probability distributions in a way that was natural and was resilient to the choice of representation, this would provide a way of measuring impact that clearly isn&#x27;t value laden. </p><p>The weakness of the abstract approach is that there is no clear interpretation of what&#x27;s going on. The choice of how we compare probability distributions seems a bit arbitrary, and it also doesn&#x27;t seem like the type of thing a human would care about if they were naively minimizing impact. Furthermore, this approach, like the one that came before, requires some baseline weak prediction capability in order for it to be applied consistently. To see why, consider that a sufficiently advanced superintelligence will always have essentially all of its probability distribution on a single future — the actual future.</p><p>Armstrong and Levinstein wrote a brief discussion for how we can calibrate the impact measure. The way that machine learning practitioners have traditionally calibrated regularizers is by measuring their effect on validation accuracy. After plotting validation accuracy against some <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\mu""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.519em;"">μ</span></span></span></span></span></span> scaling factor, practitioners settle on the value which allows their model to generalize the best. In AI alignment we must take a different approach, since it would be dangerous to experiment with small scaling values for the impact penalty without an idea of the magnitude of the measurement. </p><p>The paper points to an additional issue: if the impact measure has sharp, discontinuous increases, then calibrating the impact measure may be like balancing a pen on the tip of a finger.</p><blockquote>It is conceivable that we spend a million steps reducing µ through the ‘do nothing’ range, and that the next step moves over the ‘safe increase of u’, straight to the ‘dangerous impact’ area. </blockquote><p>This above problem motivates the following criterion for impact measures. An impact measure should scale roughly linearly in the measurement of impact on the world.

In other words, we can check <em>ex ante</em> whether any impact measure is robust to these types of linear increases in impact. On the other hand, if we find that some impact penalty <em>requires </em>superintelligent capabilities in order to measure, then it may cast doubt on the method of measurement, and our ability to trust it. And of course, it couldn&#x27;t reflect any algorithm which humans are running in their head. </p><p>After this point in time, specifying desiderata in order to avoid failure modes becomes a shift in the way that impact measures are formulated.</p><h2><a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.06565.pdf"">Concrete Problems in AI Safety </a>(Section 3), by Dario Amodei and Chris Olah et al. (2016)</h2><p>The main contribution in this paper is that it proposes a way to learn impact. In this sense, impact is less of an actual thing that we add to the utility function, and more of something that is discovered by repeated demonstration. The intention behind this shift is to move focus away from explicit ways of representing impact, which can be brittle if we focus too much on exactly how the environment is represented. The downside is that it doesn&#x27;t appear to scale to superintelligent capabilities. </p><p>If I understand this proposal correctly, an example of impact in this case would be to penalize some ML system each time it makes a large error. Over time the ML system would have an implicit penalty term for errors of that type, such that in the future it won&#x27;t be very likely to do something which has a large impact on the world. Of course, if we consider that as AI systems grow in competence they are likely to try strategies which we had not even thought about before, this approach is particularly susceptible to <a href=""https://arbital.com/p/edge_instantiation/"">edge instantiation</a>. </p><p>The paper also discusses using <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.1863"">empowerment </a>to measure influence before immediately rejecting it as a solution. The authors consider that researching simple and already well-trodden mathematical functions could yield fruitful results, providing optimism for future research into this area.</p><blockquote>Despite these issues, the example of empowerment does show that simple measures (even purely information-theoretic ones!) are capable of capturing very general notions of influence on the environment. </blockquote><h2><a href=""https://arbital.com/p/low_impact/"">Low impact</a>, by Eliezer Yudkowsky (2016)</h2><p>This Arbital article summarizes impact measurements more succinctly and comprehensively any previous work. It outlines the aim of impact research and provides useful critiques for impact penalties which are based on measuring the distance between state representations. In particular, the article expands on three foreseeable difficulties in an impact measure:</p><p>1. An artificial intelligence could try to minimize its influence by doing bad things that were low impact relative to the normal course of reality. An example would be an AI that tried to cure cancer but kept death rates constant, since this would have happened if we didn&#x27;t cure cancer. </p><p>2. Due to the existence of chaotic systems, an AI would be indifferent to particular systems which are nearly impossible to control directly, such as the weather. In this case, since the AI is indifferent, it might as well deploy nanobots in the sky since there&#x27;s not much we can do to keep weather constant.</p><p>3. The AI will end up wanting to keep everything in complete stasis, which introduces the incentive of taking over the entire world in order to keep things the way they would have turned out if the AI didn&#x27;t exist. For instance, if we constructed a low impact AI in order to learn more about alignment experimentally, the low-impact AI would want us to learn as little as possible from the experiment because every new insight we gain would be something we would not have gotten if the AI did not exist. </p><p>As I have indicated above, I think that these types of errors are quite important to consider, but I do think that impact can be framed differently in order to avoid them. In particular, there is a lot of focus on measuring the distance between worlds in some type of representation. I am skeptical that this will forever remain a problem because I don&#x27;t think that humans are susceptible to this mistake, and I also think that there are agent-relative definitions of impact which are more useful to think about. </p><p>To provide one example which guides my intuitions, I would imagine that being elected president is quite impactful from an individual point of view. But when I make this judgement I don&#x27;t primarily think about any particular changes to the world. Instead, my judgement of the impact of this event is focused more around the type of power I gain as president, such as being able to wield the control of the military. Conversely, being in a nuclear war is quite impactful because of how it limits our current situation. Having the power to exert influence, or being able to live a safe and happy life is altered dramatically in a world affected by nuclear war. </p><p>This idea is related to instrumental convergence, which is perhaps more evidence that there is a natural core to this concept of measuring impact. In one sense, they could be part of a bigger whole: collecting money is impactful because it allows me to do more things as I become wealthier. And indeed, there may be a better word than &quot;impact&quot; for the exact concept which I am imagining. </p><hr class=""dividerBlock""/><h2><a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01186.pdf"">Penalizing side effects using stepwise relative reachability</a>, by Victoria Krakovna et al. (2018)</h2><p>From what I am aware, the current approaches which researchers are most optimistic about are the impact measures based on this paper. In the first version of this paper, which came out in 2018 (updated in 2019 for attainable utility), the authors define relative reachability and compare it against a baseline state, which is also defined. I will explore this paper, and the impact measures which are derivative to this one in the next post. </p><hr class=""dividerBlock""/><p>In the <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/aLhuuNiLCrDCF5QTo/rethinking-batch-normalization"">last post</a> in this sequence, I promised to &quot;cover the basics of statistical learning theory.&quot; Despite the ease of writing those words, I found it to be much more difficult than I first imagined, delaying me a few days.

A stance or an interpretation that we choose to take, for some purpose or reason.</li>
</ul>
<p>Relevant for us humans is:</p>
<ul>
<li>We instinctively take a particular preference stance towards other humans; and humans tend to take the same stance towards others and towards each other. This makes the stance feel ""natural"" and intrinsic to the world, when it is not.</li>
</ul>
<h1>The intentional stance</h1>
<p>Daniel Dennett defined the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intentional_stance"">intentional stance</a> as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here is how it works: first you decide to treat the object whose behavior is to be predicted as a rational agent; then you figure out what beliefs that agent ought to have, given its place in the world and its purpose. Then you figure out what desires it ought to have, on the same considerations, and finally you predict that this rational agent will act to further its goals in the light of its beliefs. A little practical reasoning from the chosen set of beliefs and desires will in most instances yield a decision about what the agent ought to do; that is what you predict the agent will do.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the physical stance, we interpret something as being made of atoms and following the laws of physics. In the intentional stance, we see it as being an agent and following some goal. The first allows for good prediction of the paths of planets; the second, for the outcome of playing AlphaZero in a game of Go.</p>
<p>The preference stance (or the (ir)rationality stance<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-gadYzkTCpKiQjW4Ga-1"" id=""fnref-gadYzkTCpKiQjW4Ga-1"">[1]</a></sup>) is a more general stance, where you see the object as having preferences, but not necessarily being rational about optimising them.</p>
<h1>The preference/(ir)rationality stance</h1>
<h2>What it the intentional stance for?</h2>
<p>In a sense, the intentional stance is exactly the same as the preference stance. Dennett takes an object and treats it as an agent, and splits it into preference and rationality. Ok, he assumes that the agent is ""rational"", but allows for us to ""figure out what what beliefs the agent ought to have."" That, in practice, allows us to model a lot of irrationality if we want to. And I'm fully convinced that Dennett takes biases and other lapses of rationality into account when dealing with other humans.</p>
<p>So, in a sense, Dennett is already taking a preference towards the object. And he is doing so for the express purpose of better predicting the behaviour of that object.</p>
<h2>What is the preference stance for?</h2>
<p>Unlike the intentional stance, the preference stance is not taken for the purpose of better predicting humans. It is instead taken for the purpose of figuring out what the human preferences are - so that we could maximise or satisfy them. The <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05812"">Occam's razor paper</a> demonstrates that, from the point of view of Kolomogorov complexity, taking a good preference stance (ie plausible preferences to maximise) is not at all the same thing as taking a good (predictive) intentional stance.</p>
<p>But it often feels as if it is; we seem to predict people better when we assume, for example, that they have specific biases or want specific things. Why is this, and how does it seem to get around the result?</p>
<h2>Rationality stance vs empathy machine</h2>
<p>There are two preference stances that it is easy for humans to take. The first is to assume that an object is a rational agent with a certain preference. Then we can try and predict which action or which outcome would satisfy that preference, and then expect that action/outcome. We do this often when modelling people in economics, or similar mass models of multiple people at once.</p>
<p>The second is to use the empathy machinery that evolution has developed for us, and model the object as being human. Applying this to the weather and the natural world, we anthropomorphised and created gods. Applying to other humans (and to ourselves) gives us quite decent predictive power.</p>
<p>I suspect this is what underlies Veedrac intuition. For if we apply our empathy machine to fellow humans, we get something that is far closer to a ""goodness optimiser"", albeit a biased one, than to an ""badness nega-optimiser"".</p>
<p>But this doesn't say that the first is more likely, or more true, about our fellow humans. It say that the easiest stance for us to take is to treat other humans in this way. And this is not helpful, unless we manage to get our empathy machine into an AI. That is part of the challenge.</p>
<p>And this brings us back to why the empathy machine <em>seems</em> to make better predictions about humans. Our own internal goals, the goals that we think we have on reflection, and how we expect people (including us) to behave given those goals... all of those coevolved. It seems that it was easier for evolution to use our internal goals (see <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/rcXaY3FgoobMkH2jc/figuring-out-what-alice-wants-part-ii"">here</a> for what I mean by these) and our understanding of our own rationality, to do predictions. Rather than to run our goals and our predictions as two entirely separate processes.</p>
<p>That's why, when you use empathy to figure out someone's goals and rationality, this also allows <strong>you</strong> to better predict them. But this is a fact about you (and me), not about the world. Just as ""Thor is angry"" is actually <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/f4txACqDWithRi7hs/occam-s-razor"">much more complex</a> than electromagnetism, <em>our</em> prediction of other people via our empathy machine is simpler for us to do - but is actually more complex for an agent that doesn't already have this empathy machinery to draw on.</p>
<p>So assuming everyone is rational is a simpler explanation of human behaviour than our empathy machinery - at least, for generic non-humans.</p>
<p>Or, to quote myself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A superintelligent AI could have all the world’s video feeds, all of Wikipedia, all social science research, perfect predictions of human behaviour, be able to perfectly manipulate humans...
<strong>And still conclude that humans are fully rational.</strong></p>
<p>It would not be wrong.</p>

<p>Last year, I decided to do something for my body. I joined and regularly went to K. Training (abbreviated name), a large gym chain in german-speaking countries. The claimed philosophy is different from many gyms: there is no music, no proteine shakes to buy, mostly old people around, and insistence that it is about strength, not show-off, and that strength is what keeps your spine together etc. They have no cardio bikes, no barbell, only machines, and the high-intensity approach is that at each machine you do one continuous exercise for two minutes. If you reach the two minutes, increase the weight next time. It all seems very serious, there is an orthopedist you talk to when you become a member. It all has been in existence for some decades. The founder writes books, of course mentioning that his approach is the only one that works against pain, and that he is not heard by the mainstream. While at the same time they have contracts with many orthopedists and this is part of the marketing.</p>
<p>Now, a back problem. I have seen several orthopedists in my life, but the one I talked to this year (after two GPs, both clueless) is the first who seems competent and also listens. His comment about K. Training: it's ok, but sometimes hard to leave the contract. You could just as well try Yoga or Pilates. Anyways, he gives me a prescription for physical therapy.</p>
<p>Talking about this and that, the therapist speaks out against K Training, because no warming up / cardio (something the founder explicitly defends in his books), and Yoga/Pilates/etc is better anyways.</p>
<p>Then I googled again. Seemingly, gym experts all have their own approach. Some agree to the high-intensity two minutes thing, others disagree.</p>
<p>Then there is also Mr. L.-B., an anti-pain guru with a somewhat different approach I dont really understand, again against the ""mainstream"" but also against K. Training. And from a lecture of his that I watched on youtube, he seems like a snake-oil seller; but then, he (of course) has many fans.</p>
<p>Now I could just randomize what to do; or try to really read about approaches, but ALL of them seem plausible, if you listen to them. The investment necessary for actual judgement would be studying medicine.</p>
<p>So long story, short question: how do you actually handle such cases of pratically relevant epistemic learned helplessness?</p>

It has also been one of my greatest sources of improvement of well-being and one of the biggest factors in lifting me out of depression. How does this work? The short answer is that I keep a gratitude journal. The rest of this post is the long answer.</p><p>I think there are some theoretical reasons why we should expect gratitude to be helpful or extremely helpful. Try to imagine a time when you were deprived of something that you now have. For example, try to imagine a time when you misplaced your wallet, phone, or passport only to later realize where it was. Think of the sense of relief you got from this. Now recognize that you could feel that way now about all of the things that you have that you could have lost.</p><p>The hedonic treadmill refers to the phenomenon of us quickly getting accustomed to any new improvements that we’ve made so that we have to keep running to stay in the same place and maintain our happiness. I think one of the ways that the hedonic treadmill works is by us almost immediately taking everything for granted. If we can stop this process to some extent, through gratitude exercises, we might be able to make large improvements to our well-being.</p><p>In my own case, this is particularly vivid. Some years ago I had very bad repetitive strain injuries and associated chronic pain. I did not know if I would ever be able to work again or do many other normal things with my arms. The prospect of improvement seemed dim and my life seemed to be utterly ruined.</p><p>It seemed to me that if I could only get the use of my arms back, life would be perfect. At that time I thought to myself if things do ever get better, if there is anything positive I can draw from this piece of hell, it is to remember that feeling, so that if I recover, I can always feel that my life is perfect. You might be able to leverage past tragedies in your life in this way as well. You might be able to turn that darkness into light.</p><p>I still have some trouble with repetitive strain injuries and chronic pain, but my situation is now vastly improved. Do I feel perfect now? Well no, it’s hard to fight the hedonic treadmill, but I do feel a lot better because of gratitude exercises. </p><p>I think one mistake people make when it comes to gratitude is thinking too small. While it’s helpful to feel grateful for a lot of different things, and I do write down small things in my gratitude journal, there are lots of big things that we could feel grateful for. We don’t feel grateful for these things because we’ve become accustomed to having them and thoroughly take them for granted. It can take some extra work to feel grateful for these things, but it’s worth it.</p><p>Here is a short, and by no means exhaustive, list of some of the things you might want to try feeling grateful for: being alive at all, being alive at this time in history, having loved ones who are alive, being born a human, having functional limbs, being able to make a difference in the world, having access to godlike technology, and having access to a wider range of media for free than any library could hold.</p><p>To feel grateful for some of these things you might have to try to vividly imagine being without them for a time. If you are deprived of some of these things for a time (or temporarily believe you are) you can also try to remember what that feels like, so that you can recapture it later when you have them again. </p><p>The idea with these techniques is to help them become ingrained as habits. It is to train your mind to see more of the good things that you have and naturally feel more gratitude for them. You should also expect to feel good while doing the gratitude exercise and this should help reinforce the habit. I found this technique to be less effective when I’m feeling quite bad. However, I think practising this technique has made me feel bad less often.</p><p>Of course, we could instead imagine things as they could be in some hypothetical utopian society 100 years from now when most forms of suffering are unknown. We could then make ourselves feel bad because things are so much worse than they would be in that society. I don’t think it makes sense to say that any of these comparisons are more correct or meaningful than any other. The only thing we can say is that some of these comparisons are more useful than others. Making comparisons that allow us to feel grateful can be useful in improving our lives.</p><p>One fear I had when starting this practice was that feeling gratitude would lead to complacency. However, I think that with some care this can be avoided and we can draw from the practice in order to be more effectively altruistic. If we have the ability to more effectively control and improve our well-being through our own thoughts, without having to spend expensive resources on it, we can allow ourselves to contribute more energy and resources to improving the lives of others. This technique may also point to a way in which we can help others without expending too many resources, since it is an inexpensive means of improving mental health that can be taught.</p><p>I think this technique may also be helpful in allowing us to reflect on the suffering of the world without being overwhelmed with grief about it, which allows us to be more motivated to improve it. Part of the practice is reflecting on the suffering, but feeling grateful that we are not going through this suffering now allows us to turn this darkness into light.</p><p>People waste a huge amount of resources pursuing ever smaller amounts of happiness as they climb the social ladder. Gratitude promises to be a way of achieving this that doesn’t involve wasting these resources, which could be vastly more useful in improving the well-being of the less fortunate.</p><p>Some people might find comparisons between other people to be insensitive or in bad taste. If this is the case for you, you can instead reflect on ‘different hypothetical versions of yourself’ in different states of deprivation. I do think the process can be done in an inoffensive way—you just have to have the right intentions and be tactful. Certainly there are bad ways of doing this, such as if you use the comparison to fuel a sense of superiority or if you use it to ‘lord’ what you have over others.</p><p>The perspective I try to approach this from is one of solidarity with all other sentient beings. We may be lucky enough to have many more resources than others and if so should draw whatever we can from those resources to help others.</p><p>I sometimes feel that using gratitude in this way is too ‘Pollyanna’ or too ‘sunshine and rainbows.’ If you feel this way, I suggest considering which life feels more lucid and clear eyed to you—one where you are preoccupied with minor details, like the last person who cut you off in traffic, or one where you are keenly aware of all that you have and all that could be taken away from you.</p><p>I haven’t looked deeply at the empirical literature on the subject. I suspect that the method does have more promise than indicated by the studies, because I suspect that many people given the task of gratitude journaling in studies may not be doing so as effectively as they could be. The tips I give in this post should be an improvement on that. In practice it will still probably not be a magic bullet or panacea, but I think the method holds a lot of promise.</p><p>It’s possible that gratitude isn’t the word I should be using in this post. Appreciation might be a better word. The word gratitude carries at least a subtle suggestion that there is someone responsible and that person deserves praise, and this isn’t necessarily the case. In particular, God doesn’t exist, and if he did exist, I don’t think he would deserve our praise. Still, gratitude is the word that usually gets used in this context and it is emotionally punchier than ‘appreciation,’ so I’ve decided to keep using it.</p>",MaxCarpendale,maxcarpendale,MaxCarpendale,

I'm only summarizing the parts I found most relevant.</p><p>Many of the analogies for AI are quite broken. AI is a very broad set of software technologies, unlike nuclear weapons which are very discrete. It's not feasible to use export controls to keep ""AI"" within the US. In addition, AI will affect war far more fundamentally than just creating lethal autonomous weapons -- Helen thinks that the biggest military impact might be on logistics. It's also weird to compare data to oil, because oil is a rival good (two people can't use the same oil), whereas data can easily be copied. In addition, one barrel of oil can replace any other barrel, but data is very specific to the particular application. Helen's preferred analogy is thinking of AI as electricity -- a very general purpose tool that will transform lots of aspects of society. However, this analogy can also break down -- for example, the AI research community seems pretty important, but there was no analog for electricity.</p><p>And now for a few random points, in no particular order. China ""exports"" around 50,000 inventors (patent holders) every year, while the US imports 190,000, far more than any other country, suggesting that the US is a global hub for talent. AI is hard to define, because many of its properties lie on a continuum -- for example, is a landmine a lethal autonomous weapon? The way to affect policy is to make small, targeted changes in proposed policies so that the government makes slightly better decisions -- it's far too difficult to execute on a grand plan to get the government to do some big thing. The main skills for engaging with government on technology issues: be able to speak both to scientists as well as bureaucrats, and be able to navigate the DC setting -- knowing what people are doing, what their incentives are, and how to get your thing done given their different incentives.</p><p><strong>Rohin's opinion:</strong> I enjoyed the section on how analogies for AI are broken -- I don't usually think much about them, but they always felt a bit off, and Helen makes it very clear what the issues are. It was also interesting seeing how the perspectives on AI are quite different from those of us thinking about AGI accident risk -- we often think about single, generally intelligent AGI systems, whereas Helen emphasized how current technologies can be easily deployed in many application-specific contexts. While data for current systems is very application-specific as Helen mentioned, if you believe the unsupervised learning story data may be more interchangeable for AGI systems.</p><p><u><a href=""https://futureoflife.org/2019/07/22/on-the-governance-of-ai-with-jade-leung/"">AI Alignment Podcast: On the Governance of AI</a></u> <em>(Lucas Perry and Jade Leung)</em>: Jade makes a lot of points in this podcast, some of which I've summarized here in no particular order.</p><p>GovAI works on lots of research topics, including analysis of the inputs to AI, understanding historical cases of competition, looking at the relationship between firms and governments, and understanding public opinion.</p><p>Governance is particularly difficult because in the current competitive environment it's hard to implement any form of ""ideal"" governance; we can only make changes on the margin. As a result, it is probably better if we could get to a state where we could take a long time to deliberate about what ideal governance would look like, without having to worry about competitive pressures.</p><p>The biggest risk for governments is that they will make hasty, ill-informed regulation. However, given how uncertain we are, it's hard to recommend any concrete actions right now -- but governance will happen anyway; it won't wait for more research. One useful action we can take is to correct or add nuance to inaccurate memes and information, such as the ""race"" between the US and China, or the performance-safety tradeoff. Plausibly we should engage with government more -- we may have been biased towards working with private organizations because they are more nimble and familiar to us.</p><p>Instead of thinking about short term vs. long term, we should be thinking about the stakes. Some issues, such as privacy or job loss, can be thought of as ""short term"" but their stakes could scale to be huge in the long term. Those would be good areas to think about.</p><p><strong>Rohin's opinion:</strong> I don't have any particular thoughts on these topics, but I am glad for both this and the previous podcast, which give more of a birds-eye view of the AI governance landscape, which is hard to get from any single paper.</p><h1><strong>Technical AI alignment</strong></h1><h3><strong>Technical agendas and prioritization</strong></h3><p><u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/JSjagTDGdz2y6nNE3/on-the-purposes-of-decision-theory-research"">On the purposes of decision theory research</a></u> <em>(Wei Dai)</em>: In this post, Wei Dai clarifies that he thinks decision theory research is important because it can help us learn about the nature of rationality, philosophy, and metaphilosophy; it allows us to understand potential AI failure modes; we can better understand puzzles about intelligence such as free will, logical uncertainty, counterfactuals and more; and it could improve human rationality. It is <em>not</em> meant to find the ""correct"" decision theory to program into an AI, nor to create safety arguments that show that an AI system is free of ""decision-theoretic"" flaws.</p><h3><strong>Preventing bad behavior</strong></h3><p><u><a href=""http://files.davidqiu.com/research/papers/2019_fisac_Bridging%20Hamilton-Jacobi%20Safety%20Analysis%20and%20Reinforcement%20Learning%20[RL][Constraints].pdf"">Bridging Hamilton-Jacobi Safety Analysis and Reinforcement Learning</a></u> <em>(Jaime F. Fisac, Neil F. Lugovoy et al)</em>: Reinforcement learning is not great at enforcing constraints that hold at all times, because the agent would violate a constraint now if it would lead to higher reward later. In robust optimal control theory, we maximize the <strong>minimum</strong> of the constraint reward over time to avoid this. We can do this in the Bellman equation by taking a minimum between the current reward and estimated future value (instead of summing), but this does not uniquely define a fixed point. Just as in regular RL, we can use discounting to avoid the problem: in particular, if we interpret the discount as the probability that the episode continues, we can derive a Safety Bellman equation for which Q-learning is guaranteed to converge. They demonstrate their method in classic control environments as well as half-cheetah, with a range of RL algorithms including soft actor-critic (SAC).</p><p><strong>Rohin's opinion:</strong> I really like how simple the change is here -- it should be a one-line change for many deep RL algorithms. Previously, we had to choose between unconstrained agents for high dimensional problems, or constrained agents for low dimensional problems -- I like that this work is making progress on constrained agents for high dimensional problems, similarly to <u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10528"">Constrained Policy Optimization</a></u>. While this work doesn't involve a performance reward, you could use the resulting safe policy in order to guide a process of safe exploration to learn a policy that safely optimizes a performance metric. Of course, this is all assuming a specification for the constraint to satisfy.</p><h3><strong>Miscellaneous (Alignment)</strong></h3><p><u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08663"">Modeling AGI Safety Frameworks with Causal Influence Diagrams</a></u> <em>(Tom Everitt, Ramana Kumar, Victoria Krakovna et al)</em>: This paper describes several AI safety frameworks using the language of <u><a href=""https://medium.com/@deepmindsafetyresearch/understanding-agent-incentives-with-causal-influence-diagrams-7262c2512486"">causal influence diagrams</a></u> (<u><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/efed27be268a/alignment-newsletter-49"">AN #49</a></u>), in order to make it easy to compare and contrast them. For example, the diagrams make it clear that while <u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03137"">Cooperative IRL</a></u> and <u><a href=""https://medium.com/@deepmindsafetyresearch/scalable-agent-alignment-via-reward-modeling-bf4ab06dfd84"">reward modeling</a></u> (<u><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/f1947668b183/alignment-newsletter-34"">AN #34</a></u>) are very similar, there are significant differences: in cooperative IRL, the rewards come directly from the underlying human preferences, whereas in reward modeling, the rewards come from a reward model that depends on human feedback, which itself depends on the underlying human preferences.</p><p><strong>Rohin's opinion:</strong> I like these diagrams as a way to demonstrate the basics of what's going on in various AI safety frameworks. Sometimes the diagrams can also show the differences in safety features of frameworks. For example, in reward modeling, the agent has an incentive to affect the human feedback in order to affect the reward model directly. (Imagine getting the human hooked on heroin, so that future feedback causes the reward model to reward heroin, which could be easy to produce.) On the other hand, in cooperative IRL, the agent only wants to affect the human actions inasmuch as the actions affect the state, which is a normal or allowed incentive. (Imagine the agent causing the human to leave their house earlier so that they get to their meeting on time.)</p><h1><strong>AI strategy and policy</strong></h1><p><u><a href=""https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ZJiCfwTy5dC4CoxqA/information-security-careers-for-gcr-reduction"">Information security careers for GCR reduction</a></u> <em>(Claire Zabel and Luke Muehlhauser)</em>: This post suggests that information security could be a good career path for people looking to reduce global catastrophic risks (GCRs). For AI in particular, such experts could help mitigate attacks by malicious or incautious actors to steal AI-related intellectual property. It also reduces the risk of destabilizing AI technology races. Separately, such experts could think about the potentially transformative impact of AI on cyber offense and defense, develop or advise on credible commitment techniques (see eg. <u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.05979"">model governance</a></u> (<u><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/588354e4b91d/alignment-newsletter-38"">AN #38</a></u>)), or apply the <u><a href=""https://intelligence.org/2013/07/31/ai-risk-and-the-security-mindset/"">security mindset</a></u> more broadly.</p><p><u><a href=""https://thepolitic.org/an-interview-with-ben-garfinkel-governance-of-ai-program-researcher/"">An Interview with Ben Garfinkel</a></u> <em>(Joshua Monrad, Mojmír Stehlík and Ben Garfinkel)</em>: AI seems poised to be a very big deal, possibly through the development of AGI, and it's very hard to forecast what would happen next. However, looking at history, we can see a few very large trajectory shifts, such as the Agricultural Revolution and Industrial Revolution, where everything changed radically. We shouldn't assume that such change must be for the better. Even though it's hard to predict what will happen, we can still do work that seems robustly good regardless of the specific long-term risk. For example, Ben is optimistic about research into avoiding adversarial dynamics between different groups invested in AI, research into how groups can make credible commitments, and better forecasting. However, credible commitments are probably less tractable for AI than with nukes or biological weapons because AI systems don't leave a large physical footprint, can easily proliferate, and are not a clear category that can be easily defined.</p><h1><strong>Other progress in AI</strong></h1><h3><strong>Exploration</strong></h3><p><u><a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.04161"">Self-Supervised Exploration via Disagreement</a></u> <em>(Deepak Pathak, Dhiraj Gandhi et al)</em> (summarized by Cody): For researchers who want to build a reinforcement learning system that can learn to explore its environment without explicit rewards, a common approach is to have the agent learn a model of the world, and incentivize it to explore places where its model has the highest error, under the theory that these represent places where it needs to interact more to collect more data and improve its world model. However, this approach suffers in cases when the environment is inherently stochastic, since in a stochastic environment (think: sitting in front of a static TV and trying to predict the next frame), prediction error can never be brought to zero, and the agent will keep interacting even when its world model has collected enough data to converge as much as it can. This paper proposes an alternative technique: instead of exploring in response to prediction error, learn an ensemble of bootstrapped next-state prediction models and explore in response to variance or disagreement between the models. This has a few nice properties. One is that, in cases of inherent stochasticity, all models will eventually converge to predicting the mean of the stochastic distribution, and so even though they've not brought error down to zero, the variance among models will be low, and will correctly incentivize our agent to not spend more time trying to learn. Another benefit is that since the reward is purely a function of the agent's models, it can be expressed analytically as a function of the agent's choices and trained via direct backpropogation rather than ""black box reward"" RL, making it more efficient.</p><p><strong>Cody's opinion:</strong> I found this approach really elegant and clever as a way of addressing the ""static TV"" problem in curiosity literature. I'd be curious to see more work that introduces even stronger incentives towards diversity among the ensemble models (different architectures, even more different datasets they're trained on), to see if that amplifies the cases of model disagreement.</p><h3><strong>Deep learning</strong></h3><p><u><a href=""https://weightagnostic.github.io/"">Weight Agnostic Neural Networks</a></u> <em>(Adam Gaier et al)</em> (summarized by Cody): Inspired by the ability of animals to perform some tasks at birth, before learning about the world, this paper tries to find network architectures that perform well over a wide range of possible model parameters. The idea here is that if an architecture performs well with different sampled weights and without training to update those weights, then the architecture itself is what's responsible for encoding the solution, rather than any particular weight configuration. The authors look for such architectures on both classification and reinforcement learning problems by employing NEAT, a evolutionary method from Neural Architecture Search that searches for the best-performing topologies within the space of possible node connections and activations. The authors find that they're able to construct architectures that do better than random on their test problems without training weights explicitly.</p><p><strong>Cody's opinion:</strong> I appreciate the premise of this paper, and in general feel positively towards papers that delve into a better understanding of how much of modern neural network performance is attributable to (discrete) structural architectures vs particular settings of continuous weight parameters, and I think this paper does that in a clever way by essentially marginalizing over different weight values. The framing of this paper, implicitly comparing networks used without weight training to animals with innate abilities, did make me wonder whether the architecture vs weights analogy to evolution vs learning is a sound one. Because, while it's true that the weights weren't explicitly gradient-descent trained in this paper, the network did still perform optimization based on task performance, just over a set of discrete parameters rather than continuous ones. In that context, it doesn't really seem correct to consider the resulting architectures ""untrained"" in a way that I think that analogy would suggest. I'd be curious to see more work in this direction that blends in ideas from meta-learning, and tries to find architectures that perform well on multiple tasks, rather than just one.</p><h3><strong>Hierarchical RL</strong></h3><p><u><a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.10580"">Unsupervised Discovery of Decision States for Transfer in Reinforcement Learning</a></u> <em>(Nirbhay Modhe et al)</em></p><h3><strong>Miscellaneous (AI)</strong></h3><p><u><a href=""https://www.notion.so/Explainable-AI-Sparse-Representations-and-Signals-fedf1522aff4415d8f156e1f94bb80c5"">Explainable AI, Sparse Representations, and Signals</a></u>: So far, we have built AI systems that store knowledge <em>symbolically</em> or in a <em>distributed fashion</em> (with neural nets being the latter). While the distributed form allows us to learn knowledge and rules automatically, it is much harder to understand and interpret than symbolically represented knowledge. This post argues that the main difference is in the <strong>sparsity</strong> of the learned knowledge. Of course, with more ""sparse"" knowledge, it should be easier for us to understand the internal workings of the AI system, since we can ignore the pruned connections. However, the author also argues that sparse knowledge will help 'guide the search for models and agents that can be said to ""learn"" but also ""reason""'. Given that AGI will likely involve finding good representations for the world (in the sense of unsupervised learning), then sparse learning can be thought of as a bias towards finding better <u><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_(linear_algebra)"">bases</a></u> for world models, that are more likely to be conceptually clean and more in line with Occam's razor.</p><p>In a postscript, the author considers arguments for AI risk. Notably, there isn't any consideration of goal-directedness or alignment failures; the worry is that we will start applying superhuman AI systems to superhuman tasks, and we won't know how to deal with these situations.</p><p><strong>Rohin's opinion:</strong> Sparsity seems like a good objective to shoot for in order to ensure explainability. I'm less convinced that it's worthwhile for representation learning: I doubt humans have any sort of ""sparse learning"" bias; I think sparsity of knowledge is a natural consequence of having to understand a very complex world with a very small brain. (Whereas current ML systems only have to understand much simpler environments.)</p><h1><strong>News</strong></h1><p><u><a href=""https://openai.com/blog/microsoft/"">Microsoft invests in and partners with OpenAI to support us building beneficial AGI</a></u> <em>(Greg Brockman)</em>: After moving to a <u><a href=""https://openai.com/blog/openai-lp/"">capped-profit investment model</a></u> (<u><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/1e757d9b05cb/alignment-newsletter-52"">AN #52</a></u>), Microsoft has invested $1 billion in OpenAI.

However, if you can figure out what’s same and what’s different, you can start there. But then again, you need to figure out where analogies break down, the breaking point, to then use that as a base for First Principles.<a href=""https://neilkakkar.com/analogies.html#fn:1"">1</a></p><p>As Roald Hoffmann wrote in <a href=""http://www.roaldhoffmann.com/sites/all/files/metaphor_unchained.pdf"">The Metaphor, Unchained</a> -</p><blockquote><em>A naked metaphor clearly shows the analogy’s limitations, its capacity for misinterpretation and its productive extensions. It aids its creator as well as its audience.</em></blockquote><p>An example ought to make this clearer.</p><p>An electric circuit is like water in a pipe. That’s why, when you switch on a circuit, the light immediately switches on - there’s already water (electrons) in the pipe. And you’re just pumping them forward (voltage).</p><p>Do the electrons follow fluid dynamics? I don’t think so. There’s no optimal voltage at which the current will be greatest. (This is one breaking point)</p><p>This also helps figure out unprecedented properties. In the process of asking questions - you’re forced to think if they obey the same properties.</p><p>If one such property shows up in both that you didn’t know about earlier - it’s a big win! You’ve deepened your understanding.</p><p><strong>… or you could flip it to understand the supposedly “easier” concept better.</strong> Say, resistance in an electric wire exists because the electrons have to navigate all the atoms in the wire. The collisions heat up the wire.</p><p>Does water face any resistance inside a tube? Yes, indeed. Resistance proportional to its viscosity, length and inversely proportional to the 4th power of its radius. The smaller the tube, the higher the resistance.</p><p>Hey, electrons do the same! The resistance is proportional to length of the wire and inversely proportional to area of cross section of the wire (2nd power of its radius). The longer the length, the more atoms the electron has to evade.</p><p>Why the second power for wires but fourth power for tubes? .. Wait now, I’m comparing an invisible and visible phenomena, surely some rules of the game change? The visible (water) phenomena has electrons as well. Does that give rise to its surface tension and adhesion? Which results in the “friction”?</p><p>Even the blood vessels are like tubes carrying a fluid, blood! High and low blood pressure. How does the human body regulate that? By controlling the size of the blood vessels? Yep, we have muscles surrounding the vessels which can contract and expand - thus changing the size of the blood vessel, and thus its resistance to flow, and thus the blood flow.</p><p>Also, arteries, veins and capillaries are different in size. Is that related?</p><hr class=""dividerBlock""/><p>Here’s another example.</p><p>Humans die when exposed to radiation just like most living things. Errr, why were there so many plants in the Chernobyl TV series? (Confirm the real Chernobyl has a lush forest too).. What? Analogy breaking down? Turns out, plants are different from other living things - they aren’t as specialised as animals. <a href=""https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/why-plants-dont-die-from-cancer"">They adapt, since they can’t move anyway.</a></p><p>Oh, not as specialised? Lets take another mass extinction. The dinosaurs! How did our ancestors (the mammals) survive? They were very small, could survive in adverse conditions, and weren’t as .. specialized .. as the dinosaurs.</p><p>Wait, today, we are pretty specialized too. Does this mean higher risk of extinction? Um, not sure. The analogy doesn’t carry over fully because we learnt to adapt to, and change our environment. At greater risk of extinction given a mass extinction event? Yeah. Can we nuke the asteroid before it reaches us?</p><h1>In Language</h1><p>The analogies aren’t limited to concepts either.</p><p>Say you’re writing about something and find a word that doesn’t quite fit. You look up synonyms and find the perfect one.</p><p>What’s the implicit difference between synonyms that makes one fit and others seem awkwardly wrong? Is it a nuance in your writing you can explore further?</p><p>As hinted in a previous example, you can use the analogy both ways, figure out where it breaks on both sides to understand both concepts better. Here, that translates to understanding the synonym better, where it doesn’t mean the same as others, and leveraging that to build nuance into what you’re writing about.</p><h1>In Business</h1><p>I want to build an Uber for chewing gums.</p><p>A Superhuman for X. A Google for Y.</p><p>They’re all analogies. And, while building such a business, figuring out similarities and dissimilarities will help make a better decision.</p><p>When do things fall apart? When you take the analogy past its breaking point.</p><p>Or sometimes, you’re convinced the analogy is correct because it worked before. This is particularly brutal when you were involved in the success last time.</p><p>For example, <a href=""https://hbr.org/2005/04/how-strategists-really-think-tapping-the-power-of-analogy"">Giovanni Gavetti and Jan Rivkin write in HBR</a></p><blockquote><em>On the broadband opportunity, Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay told Gas Daily, “[Broadband]’s going to start off as a very inefficient market. It’s going to settle down to a business model that looks very much like our business model on [gas and electricity] wholesale, which obviously has been very profitable with rapid growth.” But Enron’s executives failed to appreciate important, deeper differences between the markets for natural gas and bandwidth. The broadband market was based on unproven technology and was dominated by telecom companies that resented Enron’s encroachment. The underlying good—bandwidth—did not lend itself to the kinds of standard contracts that made efficient trading possible in gas and electricity. Perhaps worst, in broadband trading, Enron had to deliver capacity the “last mile” to a customer’s site—an expensive challenge that gas wholesalers didn’t face.</em></blockquote><p>Paras Chopra on <a href=""https://invertedpassion.com/details-structure-matters-lessons-from-facebook/"">InvertedPassion</a> -</p><blockquote><em>All “social networks” are not created equal and (the right kind of) tiny details matter. Their its-like-Facebook-but-with-X-feature could potentially make it a very different thing.</em></blockquote><p>This breakdown also shows up between discovered and consumed knowledge. Discovering something for yourself gives you nuance. It helps you avoid learning too specific or too broad a lesson. When you experiment and find things out for yourself, you have a better feel for the causal loops influencing your field, and which factors are important to consider.</p><blockquote><em>“I was up close and personal to the internet stock bubble in 1999, and 2000, which is ancient history to a lot of people at this point. I got into a [lot of] back and forth with people in email telling me I was stupid because I told them that they shouldn’t speculate on dot-com stocks. [After the crash,] the lesson people learned from that was not, “I should never speculate on overvalued financial assets.” The lesson they learned was, “I should never speculate on internet stocks.” And so the same people who lost 90% or more of their money day-trading internet stocks ended up flipping homes in the mid 2000s. And getting wiped out doing that.</em> <em><strong>It’s dangerous to learn narrow lessons.</strong></em> <em>-</em> <em><a href=""http://jasonzweig.com/a-conversation-with-david-perell/"">Jason Zweig</a></em></blockquote><p>And, for the climax, my favourite analogy breakdown.</p><p>Survival of the fittest was a metaphor to explain natural selection. It was too specific a lesson, coming from a time where we couldn’t control our environment. It has broken down. We sometimes have survival of the (un)fittest now. For example, woolly sheep and slow chickens.</p><p>Next time you’re reasoning by analogy, ask yourself. “Where does this analogy break down?”</p>",neilkakkar,neilkakkar,neilkakkar,

</style></head><body><p>This post describes a pattern of abstraction that is common in mathematics, which I haven't seen described in explicit terms elsewhere. I would appreciate pointers to any existing discussions. Also, I would appreciate more examples of this phenomenon, as well as corrections and other insights!</p>
<p>Note on prerequisites for this post: in the opening example below, I assume familiarity with linear algebra and plane geometry, so this post probably won't make much sense without at least some superficial knowledge of these subjects. In the second part of the post, I give a bunch of further examples of the phenomenon, but these examples are all independent, so if you haven't studied a particular subject before, that specific example might not make sense, but you can just skip it and move on to the ones you do understand.</p>
<p>There is something peculiar about the dependency of the following concepts in math:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pythagorean theorem</li>
<li>Law of cosines</li>
<li>Angle between two vectors</li>
<li>Dot product</li>
<li>Inner product</li>
</ul>

<li>The Pythagorean theorem allows us to prove the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_cosines"">law of cosines</a> (there are many proofs of the law of cosines, but this is one way to do it).</li>
<li>Now we make the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system"">Cartesian leap</a> to analytic geometry, and start treating points as strings of numbers in some coordinate system.

<li>Using these definitions of length and angle, we can now verify the Pythagorean theorem and law of cosines.</li>
</ol>
<p>In other words, we have now taken the inner product as primitive, and derived angle, length, and distance from it.</p>
<p>Here is a shot at describing the general phenomenon:</p>
<ul>
<li>We start in a concrete domain, where we have two notions <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""A""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">A</span></span></span></span></span></span> and <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""B""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">B</span></span></span></span></span></span>, where <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""A""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">A</span></span></span></span></span></span> is a definition and <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""B""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">B</span></span></span></span></span></span> is some theorem. (In the example above, <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""A""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">A</span></span></span></span></span></span> is length/angle and <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""B""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">B</span></span></span></span></span></span> is the inner product, or rather, <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""B""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">B</span></span></span></span></span></span> is the theorem which states the equivalence of the algebraic and geometric expressions for the dot product.)</li>
<li>We find some abstractions/generalizations of the concrete domain.</li>
<li>We realize that in the abstract setting, we want to talk about <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""A""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">A</span></span></span></span></span></span> and <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""B""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">B</span></span></span></span></span></span>, but it's not so easy to see how to talk about them (because the setting is so abstract).</li>
<li>At some point, someone realizes that instead of trying to define <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""A""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">A</span></span></span></span></span></span> directly (as in the concrete case), it's better to generalize/""find the principles"" that make <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""B""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">B</span></span></span></span></span></span> tick. We factor out these principles as axioms of <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""B""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">B</span></span></span></span></span></span>.</li>
<li>Finally, using <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""B""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">B</span></span></span></span></span></span>, we can define <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""A""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">A</span></span></span></span></span></span>.</li>
<li>We go back and check that in the concrete domain, we can do this same inverted process.</li>

<p>Here is a table that summarizes this process:</p>

<p>In what sense is this pattern of generalization ""allowed""? I don't have a satisfying answer here, other than saying that generalizing in this particular way turned out to be useful/interesting. It seems to me that there is a large amount of trial-and-error and art involved in picking the correct theorem to use as the <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""B""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">B</span></span></span></span></span></span> in the process. I will also say that explicitly verbalizing this process has made me more comfortable about inner product spaces (previously, I just had a vague feeling that ""something is not right"").</p>
<p>Here are some other examples of this sort of thing in math. In the following examples, the step of using <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""B""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">B</span></span></span></span></span></span> to define <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""A""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">A</span></span></span></span></span></span> does not take place (in this sense, the inner product case seems exceptional; I would greatly appreciate hearing about more examples like it).</p>
<ul>
<li>Metric spaces: in Euclidean geometry, the triangle inequality is a theorem. But in the theory of metric spaces, the triangle inequality is taken as part of the definition of a metric.</li>
<li>Sine and cosine: in middle school, we define these functions in terms of angles and ratios of side lengths of a triangle. Then we can prove various things about them, like the power series expansion. When we generalize to complex inputs, we then take the series expansion as the definition.</li>
<li>Probability: in elementary probability, we define the probability of an event as the number of successful outcomes divided by the number of all possible outcomes. Then we notice that this definition satisfies <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_axioms#Axioms"">some properties</a>, namely: (1) the probability is always nonnegative; (2) if an event happens for certain, then its probability is <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""1""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mn""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">1</span></span></span></span></span></span>; (3) if we have some mutually exclusive events, then we can find the probability that at least one of them happens by summing their individual probabilities. When we generalize to cases where the outcomes are crazy (namely, countably or uncountably infinite), instead of defining probability as a ratio, we take the properties (1), (2), (3) as the definition.</li>

This is Jacob’s wife, and <a href=""https://putanumonit.com/2019/07/20/summer-programming-notice-2019/"">while Jacob is off chilling in the fjords</a>, I’m staying home and have volunteered to write a guest post.</p><p>Instead of trying to match the usual Putanumonit fare, I chose to write about something I find very exciting. I’m a biologist, and while I normally work on research involving the sense of touch in tiny roundworms, I love to read about interesting animal biology that I come across through pop-sci media. Yes, I am one of those people you might find spouting “weird animal sex facts” at parties. But seriously, the diversity of life out there is incredible, and I really can’t get enough of learning and thinking about it. So here’s a bit about a creature that’s been capturing my fascination recently.</p><p><figure><img src=""https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/bioluminescent-octopus.jpg?w=900"" class=""draft-image "" style=""width:40%"" /></figure></p><p>Consider the octopus. But first, you might want to consider considering the octopus. Why consider the octopus? I think they’re incredibly interesting creatures, and upon reflecting I think that’s probably because I’m so confused by them. They wouldn’t be very interesting to me if everything I knew about them fit well into my world view without jostling the content or structure of surrounding information, even if I had reached the point of knowing enough to know how much I didn’t know. Working in research, I’ve been whacked upon the head several times with the fact that just because information isn’t known or a problem isn’t solved, that doesn’t automatically mean that anyone cares about learning the information or solving the problem.</p><p>That goes for myself as well: I don’t know how many teeth the average walrus has, but until now it’s never occurred to me to look it up because it really doesn’t make much of a difference to me whether it’s 26 or 32. Once I started thinking about it, I had to Google the answer (<a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=How+many+teeth+does+a+walrus+have?"">it’s 18</a>), but I’m happy to stop there instead of asking the same question about every other toothed animal I can think to name. It’s slightly more interesting for me to consider what walruses use their tusks for (Google says <a href=""https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/w/walrus/"">mostly for gripping the ice to haul themselves out of the water</a>), but why should that question be more interesting? Walrus tusks are weird, and weirdness contributes to interestingness.</p><p><figure><img src=""https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/pacific-walrus-912041_1280.jpg?w=900"" class=""draft-image "" style=""width:40%"" /></figure></p><p><em>Whaaaat is going on?</em></p><p>For me, having the initial question answered actually spawns more questions. If tusks are so useful for pulling oneself up onto the ice, why are there seals without tusks? Now I’ve added confusion on top of the weirdness, and I’m even more interested. The same thing happened to me regarding octopuses.</p><h2>Exhibit A: Octopuses are weird.</h2><p>Octopuses and other cephalopods (the clade including octopuses, squid, and cuttlefish) can change the color of their skin by expanding and contracting pigment-filled bags to show or conceal their contents. Changes in colors and patterns are associated with certain behaviors, like hunting, resting, or defensive maneuvering. Octopuses can also change the texture of their skin by extending projections called papillae, which go from being small bumps to tall spikes. Feel free to spend a few minutes <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9guY3EjNlA"">watching this</a> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSq8nghQZqA"">in action</a><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbfMKSlXv4"">on YouTube</a>.</p><p><figure><img src=""https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/octopus-camouflage_0.jpeg?w=900"" class=""draft-image "" style=""width:40%"" /></figure></p><p><em>Nothing but a bit of coral here</em></p><p>Another particularly strange facet of these creatures: octopuses have an unusually complex system for RNA editing, so that the same stretch of DNA can give rise to a large diversity of RNA codes (basic bio review: DNA is transcribed into RNA which is translated into proteins). In most animals, evolution is thought to occur mostly through changes to DNA, but <a href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/curiouser-and-curiouser-octopuss-evolution-is-even-stranger-than-thought/"">cephalopod evolution and adaptation</a>appears to have occurred mostly through RNA editing, with their DNA genomes changing relatively little over millennia.</p><h2>Exhibit B: Octopuses are confusing.</h2><p>Octopuses appear to be very intelligent. They get up to all sorts of shenanigans in captivity, like <a href=""https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/04/160414-inky-octopus-escapes-intelligence/"">escaping their tanks</a>, <a href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/are-octopuses-smart/"">disassembling plumbing</a>, or <a href=""https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=96476905"">purposefully messing with electrical equipment for their own amusement</a>. They’ve also been trained to solve puzzles and mazes, and <a href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-mind-of-an-octopus/"">seem to be able to recognize individual humans</a>. However, they lack a lot of characteristics that we usually associate with intelligent animals: they aren’t social, they aren’t long-lived, and they don’t engage in post-hatching parental care.</p><p>Some intelligent animal species have something akin to culture, where certain adaptive behaviors must be taught. Cetacean (whale and dolphin) hunting techniques are one <a href=""https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/10/171016122201.htm"">example of this</a>, and since octopuses are known to use complex hunting strategies it would make sense for them to use their intelligence for intergenerational information exchange. But octopus parental care only happens up until egg-hatching, whereupon the octopus mom will go slink off and die instead of teaching her babies anything.</p><p>That brings me to something I find particularly confusing about octopuses: why do octopuses die after reproducing? It isn’t unusual for animals to die after reproducing once, but its certainly worth <a href=""https://www.cell.com/current-biology/pdf/S0960-9822(16)30626-1.pdf"">asking why that should be the case</a>. What’s particularly interesting about the way octopuses die after reproducing is that it seems to occur by active self-destruction rather than by total expenditure of available resources.</p><p>Despite the adage of sperm being cheap and eggs being expensive, even male octopuses will often die after reproducing once. Some go to <a href=""http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150223-mysteries-of-cannibal-octopus-sex"">lengths to avoid being cannibalized</a> by their mate, like detaching their mating arm (which is effectively like a penis for them) and leaving it stuck inside the female.</p><p>But without their penises it’s not as if they’re escaping with their lives in order to mate again (although some species have been found to have more than one mating arm). Instead they <a href=""https://books.google.com/books?id=Rh0BDmAP5CIC&lpg=PA137&ots=JJa4W6IDZa&dq=octopus%20male%20dementia&pg=PA137#v=onepage&q&f=false"">go off to become senile</a> and die from their own carelessness within a few weeks. Usually that means being eaten by some other predator, so it would actually make more sense in my mind for those male octopuses to allow their mate to eat them, <a href=""https://www.cell.com/current-biology/pdf/S0960-9822(16)31202-7.pdf"">providing her with energy</a> to take care of the fertilized eggs instead of just giving up their bodies to whatever random carnivore. <a href=""https://www.mbari.org/octopus-mating-games/"">Males have been observed mating with multiple female octopuses</a>, but only for a relatively short period of time before they wander off and die alone.</p><p>While female octopuses do spend <a href=""https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0103437"">a lot of time</a> and energy taking care of their fertilized eggs and will stop hunting while doing so, it still doesn’t seem that their deaths are absolutely energetically necessary. Female octopuses in captivity have been observed self-mutilating in apparent effort to hasten their own deaths after mating, <a href=""https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/09/180925140402.htm"">smashing themselves into walls</a> and eating off the tips of their own tentacles. Also, it seems that if a certain part of the octopus brain (called the optic gland) is removed, the females won’t engage in this behavior and instead go on to live, eat, and even mate again after reproducing. The optic gland was also found to release hormone-like signals that initiate programmed cell death elsewhere in the octopus’s body. With this being the case it seems that something more than malnourishment causes the female octopus to die after reproduction.</p><p>It’s important to note that these experiments were done on octopuses living in captivity, so perhaps a wild female octopus would have little chance of survival after spending so much energy taking care of her eggs, but if that were really the case, why would the animals need to have a self-destruct program installed?</p><p><figure><img src=""https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/ocotpus-lair-stuart-westmorland.jpg?w=900"" class=""draft-image "" style=""width:40%"" /></figure></p><p><em>Brooding octopus mom</em></p><p>All this points to orphaned octopus babies having an advantage over those with living parents, which is easy enough to fathom. Without mom and dad around, the kids are left with more food and territory for themselves. However I’m still confused. Wouldn’t a given gene be more likely to replicate itself residing in an individual that reproduced multiple times in addition to being in half the octopus babies it helped produce?</p><p>Here’s a try at coming up with a possible explanation: maybe octopuses are like single-use consumer products, think plastic forks. Plastic forks are so cheap that people are willing to buy them, eat with them once, toss them in the trash, and then buy new plastic forks for the next picnic that comes around. In order to reuse the forks, you’d have to wash them, which takes effort, but they can also be flimsy enough that you might already have a few bent prongs after a single round of use.</p><p>I don’t think I’d describe octopuses as particularly “cheap” though: while a single brood contains thousands of eggs, the female spends months guarding and cleaning the unhatched eggs without leaving to hunt and eat. After that, the offspring take months or even years to reach sexual maturity, and on average, you’d only expect two individuals from a brood to make it that far and successfully reproduce (assuming a stable population size). To continue with the fork analogy, it could be that they’re annoying to wash, here meaning that it’s difficult for them to make the transition from mating mode to growth and maintenance mode. Seeing as how the octopuses with their optic glands removed seemed to do okay at that, I’m not so sure, but again those octopuses were presumably being kept safe and fed with minimal effort on their part.</p><p>Is it that octopuses are flimsy like plastic fork prongs? Well, you’ve got the males that detach their mating arms to keep from being eaten, and generally they really can’t mate again after that (but again I’m super confused about why they bother trying to avoid being cannibalized if they don’t mate again afterwards). And you’ve got the females that are malnourished and weak after taking care of their eggs for months without hunting (but again I’m super confused as to why the self-destruct mode is necessary if they’re so likely to die right afterwards). So “flimsy” seems to fit but in a way that doesn’t make a lot of sense.</p><p>There is at least one octopus species that doesn’t tend to die after reproducing for the first time, called the Larger Pacific Striped Octopus (let’s just say LPSO). After reaching sexual maturity, LPSO females will brood for up to 8 months, repeatedly mating and spawning new eggs. The species’ unusual behavior life history was <a href=""https://www.earthtouchnews.com/natural-world/reproduction/long-lost-octopus-reemerges-with-some-truly-strange-sex-habits/"">first recorded in the 1970s</a>, but was rejected for publication because it seemed way too strange (in the sense of being so different from other octopuses) and reviewing scientists didn’t trust the observations. After that it took about 30 years for the observations to be <a href=""https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0134152#pone-0134152-g002"">confirmed and published</a>.</p><p><figure><img src=""https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/mating-1440x1007.jpg?w=900"" class=""draft-image "" style=""width:40%"" /></figure></p><p><em>LPSO kisses</em></p><p>What I consider to be the most striking difference about LPSOs is that they seem to be much more social than other octopus species. Instead of living solitary lives as almost all other octopuses do, they’ve been found living in large groups and sharing dens and hunting grounds. It seems like they’re capable of recognizing individuals among their species, and from what I could find they haven’t been observed cannibalizing each other. Perhaps most octopus parents have to die simply because they’re way too likely to eat their own offspring?</p><p>I think the biggest obstacle preventing us from understanding octopuses is that they’re hard for us to observe. We can capture them and raise them in captivity, but that doesn’t tell us much about how they’re adapted to the ecosystem they live in. We can stick video cameras underwater and make graduate students take careful notes on any octopus that swims by, but that only works for species that live in shallow water where light can get through. How to effectively study octopuses will prove to be quite the puzzle, but I’m looking forward to additional insights.</p><p>I hope you’re very confused about octopuses at this point, and I hope you’re happy about it. Science occurs in areas where believing you understand what’s going on tends to mean you’re deluding yourself, and NOT UNDERSTANDING has to be a default state that can sometimes be chipped into bits of UNDERSTANDING A LITTLE. But you know you might be in for a really good time when you come across a chunk of I AM SO CONFUSED BY THIS SEEMINGLY CONTRADICTORY INFORMATION, because that’s where you might find an interesting story that other people will care to hear.</p>",Jacobian,jacob-falkovich,Jacob Falkovich,

Already joining us in Berlin? Tell your best fellow human to join us
When? Fr 30.08 noon - Mo 02.09 Where? <a href=""http://jh-wannsee.de"">http://jh-wannsee.de</a> How much? €200</p>
<p>Less than 28 days left until the LessWrong Community and aspiring rationalists take off together for an exciting long weekend of sharing, exploration, connection and celebration. In the last few months we have already gotten many inspiring applications and filled all but the very last 10 spots! Apply now and join us for this special event.</p>
<p>From Friday August 30th to Monday 2nd September aspiring rationalists from across Europe will gather for 4 days of socializing, fun and intellectual exploration. The majority of the content will be unconference style and participant driven. Yet, we are very delighted to welcome Dr. Wanja Wiese as our keynote speaker and his take on predictive engines, conscious machines, and uploading. Find the full abstract for the keynote attached below.</p>
<p>On Friday afternoon we will put up four big daily planners and before you can spell “epistemology” the attendees will fill them up with 50+ workshops, talks and activities of their own devising, such as sessions about rationality techniques, acrobatic yoga and authentic relating; you can learn all about new hyper-cost-effective altruistic interventions, whether a dragon could hover and much much more.</p>
<p>This is our 6th year and we feel that the atmosphere and sense of community at these weekends is something really special. If that sounds like something you would enjoy and you have some exciting ideas or skills to contribute, do come along and get involved. This year is the biggest one yet and it’s an entire day longer than previous years!</p>
<p>The ticket price of €200 includes accommodation for 3 nights, on-site meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner) and snacks, as well as a tasty welcome lunch at 12:00 on Friday, and a shuttle bus from the restaurant to the venue. On Monday, we checkout by 10:00, but can continue to use some of the conference rooms for coworking and socializing until 15:00.</p>
<p>We still have spots available! Apply here: <a href=""http://tiny.cc/lwcw2019_signup"">tiny.cc/lwcw2019_signup</a> and make sure to let us know what experience and ideas you may contribute to this event: <a href=""http://tiny.cc/lwcw2019_contribution"">tiny.cc/lwcw2019_contribution</a>.</p>

<p>From Predictive Engines to Conscious Machines and Uploading?
Predictive processing approaches continue to play an influential role in cognitive neuroscience and philosophy of cognitive science. According to predictive processing, perception and action are underpinned by inference processes on sensory signals, based on an internal model of the world. Since predictive processing is a type of computation, it can also be implemented in artificial, silicon-based systems. But would this endow artificial systems with the same types of mental properties that intelligent biological systems, such as ourselves, possess? A lot hinges on whether the neural mechanisms underpinning consciousness and cognition can be regarded as implementations of predictive processing. If implementing certain forms of predictive processing is sufficient for consciousness, non-biological conscious machines will be possible. In principle, this would also enable us to upload our minds, thereby transcending the limits of mortal biological organisms. But would an uploaded version of myself really be me? And to what extent am I real in the first place, especially if what I experience as ‘me’ is the result of an evolved inference process?</p>

A broadening of awareness and contexts. </h2><p>For about 6 months of time when I was really focused on moods (and 10 years before that), I felt like I didn’t have moods, moods had me (moods distinct from emotions which can be had from moment to moment, moods are more like background, <em>the colour of the day</em>). I would wake up and find out today was “miserable” or “excited”.<br/></p><p>I worked on a specific type of meditation practice that is called broadening of awareness (there are 2 different instructions for methods).  I got lucky that this helped me and I wasn’t expecting it. When moods had me, it felt like things “just are” miserable. Now my awareness is broader than the moods and “I”* contain them.  (*meditative “I” and “self” are a rabbit hole)<br/></p><p><strong>Instructions</strong>: Most people have their sense of their self boundary in line with their skin barrier. “I” end at my skin. But it’s possible to expand that boundary, and shift it to larger. Particularly the “kinetic sphere”, the area where one might be able to reach outside the body, and then further to the whole room size. Holding this “barrier” thing at the size of the room means that I’m “anchored” metaphorically to more solid things than my own body. Obviously “I’m” still the same but my ground is the actual stationary room. Which does not feel moods like my body does. (*explanation of why it helps may be entirely irrelevant, fact is, anecdata: it helped me)<br/></p><p>There’s space in my new expanded “me” to find the body being a certain mood but also to find stillness out there in the room which doesn’t get dragged around like the moods do.  I felt the pull of daily moods dry up. Obviously my body is still in grump but “I’m not” mentally trapped in that experience. From there, there’s a new, deeper breathing pattern that supports the broader awareness practice and that’s to be discovered and also hinted at.  I would encourage trying it for a few minutes a day and then going for a permanent shift into what is sometimes described as “spaciousness”.</p><p><strong>Instructions 2</strong>: awareness specifically in the visual field can be expanded out the peripheral. Start by picking an object straight ahead to look at and focus on. Now expand the awareness to the peripheral of the visual field. Hold there for 30 seconds, then push on towards expanding the peripheral. this works well looking up at the sky, or the ocean because of the broadness of the visual object in the visual field. push the “awareness” beyond the visual field until there’s a sense of spidey-sense tingling to what’s outside the visual field. Hold a broadness of awareness to the visual area and the spidey sense. Try to engage this broad sense regularly and through the day, try to live in this broad-sense of the world around you. Notice that a “mood” is within this sense, not fully covering the whole space. If you work at the broadness, that sense comes.</p><h2>2. Stages of insight</h2><p>At the same time as trying that practice, I was cycling through (technical meditation term – can be read about in MCTB2 book) “<a href=""https://www.mctb.org/mctb2/table-of-contents/part-iv-insight/30-the-progress-of-insight/"">the stages of insight</a>“. As I would cycle I would hit sensation like fear, and it would call up involuntary intrusive memories about things I feared, then I would the next day have a “when will it end” feeling and wrestle with that one.</p><p>For 2, what became important is forming a relationship with the memories that I didn’t like. Due to lots of meditation, I was pretty clear what was normal and what was an intrusive visit from my past. I started asking the question, “why is this here?” and that question eventually turned into, “how is this here to help?” or “what do I need to still learn from this memory?” and that was a huge shift.<br/></p><p>After those questions were hard ingrained into my attitude, within a week, shitty memories stopped showing up. Possibly because I got so good at relating to them that I was never calling them, “shitty memories”, and possibly because I never felt shit again about them, I’d just appreciate the lesson that I was to learn.  And from that I stopped cycling nearly as hard. I still notice bits of cycling but I’m above the cycle, not in it.<br/></p><h2>3 Greater bodily awareness.</h2><p>a few days ago I wanted a photo of myself, so I put on a fancy shirt and got out of bed to take the photo.  3 minutes later I found myself eating things. When I asked myself what’s going on, because I wasn’t hungry, I noticed that I was cold and I was using food to stop feeling cold. An interesting discovery. I made my way back to warm things.<br/></p><p>It’s bodily awareness that helps with the moods and actions. I can feel where in my body (or not) I’m feeling depressed or angry and I can alleviate it via movement or internal sensation and not by outwardly being moody or suffering mood swings.<br/></p><p>For this I’ve done a lot of meditation and body scan attention work. Any sensation is relevant, itching the head, the knot in the stomach, the tingle in the toes. It’s all relevant to the way I think.</p><p>It’s a rat rationality thing to assume that these sensation experiences are noise but they are not. All sensation is relevant.<br/></p><p>Some combination of the 3 have helped me to the point where I doubt I have bipolar any more.  I was fairly confident at one point and now it seems unlikely to be a useful diagnosis.<br/></p><p>And if there’s a 4 and 5 it’s, watch <em>sleep</em> and <em>social life</em> and make sure to get enough of both, as well as being aware of instability in both which can start a cycle of instability.  This is from Interpersonal Social Rhythm Therapy <a href=""https://www.ipsrt.org/"">IPSRT</a> – the only therapy designed for bipolar. Fixing my sleep made a big difference, and fixing my mood first thing in the morning did too.</p><p>Shoutout to <a href=""https://www.bipolarawakenings.com/"">Bipolar Awakenings</a> for being more on the odd-strange-spiritual side of meditative practice towards progress on alleviating bipolar.</p>",Elo,elo,Elo,

Anchoring seems very <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring#Difficulty_of_avoiding"">difficult to avoid</a>.  Experiments have found that warning subjects about anchoring, or giving them cash incentives, doesn't solve the problem.</p>
<p>Here's an algorithm to fight anchoring that I would like to see a researcher test, based on <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm"">binary search</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Tell subjects to think of a number which is clearly too high for the quantity they want to estimate (an upper bound).</li>
<li>Tell subjects to think of a number which is clearly too low (a lower bound).</li>
<li>Tell subjects to find the midpoint of the upper bound and the lower bound and figure out whether it's too high or too low.</li>
<li>The midpoint has now been judged as an upper/lower bound.  Combined with the original lower/upper bound, we have a new, narrower range to explore.  If this range is narrow enough, report its midpoint; otherwise go to step 3.</li>
</ol>
<p>You could have two experimental conditions: one condition where subjects think of a number which is clearly too high first (the steps are in the order above), and another condition where subjects think of a number which is clearly too low first (steps 1 &amp; 2 are swapped).  If estimates from the two conditions are similar, the technique is successful.</p>

Essentially, you can't learn the preferences of an agent from its behaviour unless you make assumptions about its rationality, and you can't learn its rationality unless you make assumptions about its preferences.</p>
<p>More importantly, simplicity/Occam's razor/regularisation don't help with this, unlike with most No Free Lunch theorems. Among the simplest explanations of human behaviour are:</p>
<ol>
<li>We are always fully rational all the time.</li>
<li>We are always fully anti-rational all the time.</li>
<li>We don't actually prefer anything to anything.</li>

<p>That result, though mathematically valid, seems highly theoretical, and of little practical interest - after all, for most humans, it's obvious what other humans want, most of the time. But I'll argue that the result has strong practical consequences.</p>
<h1>Identifying clickbait</h1>
<p>Suppose that Facebook or some other corporation decides to cut down on the amount of clickbait on its feeds.</p>
<p>This shouldn't be too hard, the programmers reason. They start by selecting a set of clickbait examples, and check how people engage with these. They programme a neural net to recognise that kind of ""engagement"" on other posts, which nets a large amount of candidate clickbait. They then go through the candidate posts, labelling the clear examples of clickbait and the clear non-examples, and add these to the training and test sets. They retrain and improve the neural net. A few iterations later, their neural net is well trained, and they let it run on all posts, occasionally auditing the results. Seeking to make the process more transparent, they run interpretability methods on the neural net, seeking to isolate the key components of clickbait, and clear away some errors or over-fits - maybe the equivalent, for clickbait, of removing the ""<a href=""https://otherknowsbest.com/2015/08/07/the-connection-between-deep-dream-and-the-alienness-of-algorithmic-thoughts/"">look for images of human arms</a>"" in the dumbbell identification nets.</p>
<h2>The central issue</h2>
<p>Could that method work? Possibly. With enough data and enough programming efforts, it certainly seems that it could. So, what's the problem?</p>
<p>The problem is that so many stages of the process requires choices on the part of the programmers. The initial selection of clickbait in the first place; the labelling of candidates at the second stage; the number of cycles of iterations and improvements; the choice of explicit hyper-parameters and implicit ones (like how long to run each iteration); the auditing process; the selection of key components. All of these rely on the programmers being able to identify clickbait, or the features of clickbait, when they see them.</p>
<p>And that might not sound bad; if we wanted to identify photos of dogs, for example, we would follow a similar process. But there is a key difference. There is a somewhat objective definition of dog (though beware <a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/7l77li8drgabzjf/cat_dog.jpg?raw=1"">ambiguous cases</a>). And the programmers, when making choices, will be approximating or finding examples of this definition. But there is no objective, semi-objective, or somewhat objective definition of clickbait.</p>
<p>Why? Because the definition of clickbait depends on assessing the preferences of the human that sees it. It can be roughly defined as ""something a human is likely to click on (behaviour), but wouldn't really ultimately want to see (preference)"".</p>
<p>And, and this is an important point, <strong>the No Free Lunch theorem applies to humans</strong>. So humans can't deduce preferences or rationality from behaviour, at least, not without making assumptions.</p>
<p>So how do we solve the problem? Because humans do often deduce the preferences and rationality of other humans, and often other humans will agree with them, including the human being assessed. How do we do it?</p>
<p>Well, drumroll, we do it by... <strong>making assumptions</strong>. And since evolution is so very lazy, the assumptions that humans make - about each other's rationality/preference, about their own rationality/preference - are all very similar. <a href=""http://php.scripts.psu.edu/users/n/x/nxy906/COMPS/CLT/cultureandCLT/Millercultureconstrual.pdf"">Not identical</a>, of course, but compared with a random agent making random assumptions to interpret the behaviour of another random agent, humans are essentially all the same.</p>
<p>This means that, to a large extent, <strong>it is perfectly valid for programmers to use their own assumptions</strong> when defining clickbait, or in other situations of assessing the values of others. Indeed, until we <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CSEdLLEkap2pubjof/research-agenda-v0-9-synthesising-a-human-s-preferences-into"">solve the issue in general</a>, this may be the only way of doing this; it's certainly the only easy way.</p>
<h2>The lesson</h2>
<p>So, are there any practical consequences for this? Well, the important thing is that <strong>programmers realise they are using their own assumptions</strong>, and take these into consideration when programming. Even things that they feel might just be ""debugging"", by removing obvious failure modes, could be them injecting their assumptions into the system. This has two major consequence:</p>
<ol>
<li>These assumptions don't form a nice neat category that ""<a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/d5NyJ2Lf6N22AD9PB/where-to-draw-the-boundary"">carve reality at its joints</a>"". Concepts such as ""dog"" are somewhat ambiguous, but concepts like ""human preferences"" will be even more so, because they are a series of evolutionary kludges, rather than a single natural thing. Therefore we expect that extrapolating programmer assumptions, or moving to a new distribution, will result in bad behaviour, that will have to be patched anew with more assumptions.</li>
<li>There are cases when their assumptions and those of the users may diverge; looking out for these situations is important. This is easier if programmers realise they are making assumptions, rather than approximating objectively true categories.</li>

But one thing money buys you is flexibility, which can be used to avoid taxes. Because of this, <strong>taxes aimed at the wealthy tend to end up hitting the well-off-or-rich-but-not-truly-wealthy harder</strong>, and tax cuts aimed at the poor end up helping the middle class. Examples (feel free to stop reading these when you get the idea, this is just the analogy section of the essay):</p><ul><li>Computer programmers typically have the option to work remotely in a low-tax state; teachers need to be where the classroom is.&nbsp;</li><li>Estate taxes tend to hit families with single large assets (like a business) harder than those with diverse investments (who can simply sell assets to pay for taxes), who are hit harder than those with enough wealth to create trust funds.</li><li>Executives can choose to receive stock (which is taxed more favorably) instead of cash to the exact percentage they desire. Well paid employees are offered stock, but the amount will not be tailored to their needs. Lower level employees either are not offered this, or are not in a position to take advantage of it.</li><li>The legal distinction between a business (whose expenses are tax deductible) and a hobby (deductions not allowed) is based on whether the activity nets you income (there are <a href=""https://amynorthardcpa.com/do-i-have-a-hobby-or-a-business-and-what-does-that-mean-for-my-taxes/"">complications </a>and you can sometimes prove a money loser is a business, but this is a good rule of thumb). Small business owners (e.g. lawyers) can fold their occasionally-revenue-generating hobby (e.g. photography) into their real business, enabling tax deductions for their hobby.</li><li>IRAs, 401ks, HSAs, and FSAs all lock your money up for a time or purpose, in exchange for lower or delayed taxes. You can only take advantage of them if you’re sure you won’t need the money for another purpose sooner.</li><li>More examples <a href=""https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/economy/reports/2018/07/25/453981/11-ways-wealthy-corporations-will-game-new-tax-law/"">here</a>.</li></ul><p>Note that most of these are perfectly legal and the rest are borderline. But we're still not getting the result we want, of taxes being proportional to income.</p><p>When we assess moral blame for a situation, we typically want it to be roughly in proportion to much power a person has to change said situation. But just like money can be used to evade taxes, <strong>power can be used to avoid blame. This results in a distorted blame-distribution apparatus which assigns the least blame to the person most able to change the situation.&nbsp;</strong>Allow me a few examples to demonstrate this.</p><h2>Examples 1 + 2: Corporate Malfeasance</h2><p>Amazon.com provides a valuable service by letting any idiot sell a book, with minimal overhead. One of the costs of this complete lack of verification is that people will sell things that wouldn't pass verification, such as <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/23/technology/amazon-domination-bookstore-books.html"">counterfeits</a>, at great cost to publishers and authors. Amazon could never sell counterfeits directly: they're a large company that's easy to sue. But by setting themselves up as a platform on which other people sell, they enable themselves to profit from counterfeits.</p><p>Or take slavery. No company goes “I’m going to go out and enslave people today” (especially not publicly), but not paying people is sometimes cheaper than paying them, so financial pressure will push towards slavery. Public pressure pushes in the opposite direction, so companies try not to visibly use slave labor. But they can’t control what their subcontractors do, and especially not what their <a href=""https://qz.com/494818/in-much-of-the-world-the-sweatshop-isnt-a-factory-its-someones-kitchen-floor/"">subcontractors’ subcontractors’ subcontractors</a> do, and sometimes this results in workers being unpaid and physically blocked from leaving.</p><p>Who’s at fault for the subcontractor(^3)’s slave labor? One obvious answer is “the person <a href=""https://www.somo.nl/hidden-subcontracting-in-the-garment-industry/"">locking them in during the fire</a>” or “the parent who gives their kid piecework”, and certainly it couldn’t happen without them. But if we say “Nike’s lack of knowledge makes them not responsible”, we give them an incentive to subcontract without asking follow up questions. The executive is probably benefiting more from the system of slave labor than the factory owner is from his little domain, and has more power to change what is happening. If the small factory owner pays fair wages, he gets outcompeted by a factory that does use slave labor. If the Nike CEO decides to insource their manufacturing to ensure fair working conditions, something actually changes.</p><p>...Unless consumers switch to a cheaper, slavery-driven shoe brand.</p><p>Which is actually really hard to not do. You could choose more expensive shoes, but the profit margin is still bigger if you shrink expenses, so that doesn’t help (which is why <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2014/05/25/surprise-fairtrade-doesnt-benefit-the-poor-peasants/#51151b51370d"">Fairtrade was a failure</a> from the workers’ perspective). You can’t investigate the manufacturing conditions of everything you buy-- it’s just too time consuming. But if you punish obvious enslavement and conduct no follow up studies, what you get is obscured enslavement, not decent working conditions.</p><p><em><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0199729883/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=acesoundergla-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0199729883&amp;linkId=1f470ff27f2aca0ea6ab527dcb7a33e3"">Moral Mazes</a></em> describes the general phenomenon on page 21:</p><blockquote>Moreover, pushing down details relieves superiors of the burden of too much knowledge, particularly guilty knowledge. A superior will say to a subordinate, for instance: “Give me your best thinking on the problem with [X].” When the subordinate makes his report, he is often told: “I think you can do better than that,” until the subordinate has worked out all the details of the boss’s predetermined solution, without the boss being specifically aware of “all the eggs that have to be broken.” It is also not at all uncommon for very bald and extremely general edicts to emerge from on high. For example, “Sell the plant in [St. Louis]; let me know when you’ve struck a deal,” or “We need to get higher prices for [fabric X]; see what you can work out,” or “Tom, I want you to go down there and meet with those guys and make a deal and I don’t want you to come back until you’ve got one.” This pushing down of details has important consequences.<br>First, because they are unfamiliar with—indeed deliberately distance themselves from—entangling details, corporate higher echelons tend to expect successful results without messy complications. This is central to top executives’ well-known aversion to bad news and to the resulting tendency to kill the messenger who bears the news.<br>Second, the pushing down of details creates great pressure on middle managers not only to transmit good news but, precisely because they know the details, to act to protect their corporations, their bosses, and themselves in the process. They become the “point men” of a given strategy and the potential “fall guys” when things go wrong. From an organizational standpoint, overly conscientious managers are particularly useful at the middle levels of the structure. Upwardly mobile men and women, especially those from working-class origins who find themselves in higher status milieux, seem to have the requisite level of anxiety, and perhaps tightly controlled anger and hostility, that fuels an obsession with detail. Of course, such conscientiousness is not necessarily, and is certainly not systematically, rewarded; the real organizational premiums are placed on other, more flexible, behavior.</blockquote><p>These examples differ in an important way from tax structuring: structuring requires seeking out advice and acting on it to achieve the goal. It’s highly <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agency_(sociology)"">agentic</a>. The Wells Fargo and apparel-outsourcing cases required no such agency on the part of executives. They vaguely wished for something (more revenue, fewer expenses), and somehow it happened. An employee who tried to direct the executives’ attention to the fact that they were indirectly employing slaves would probably be fired before they ever reached the executives. Executives are not only outsourcing their dirty work, they’re outsourcing knowledge of their dirty work.&nbsp;</p><p>[Details of personal anecdotes changed both intentionally and by the vagaries of human memory]</p><h2>Example/Exception 2.5: Corporate Malfeasance Gone Wrong</h2><p>The&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2016-09-09/wells-fargo-opened-a-couple-million-fake-accounts"">Wells Fargo account fraud scandal</a>: in order to meet quotas, entry level Wells Fargo employees created millions of unauthorized accounts (typically extra services for existing customers). I originally included this as an example of ""executives incentivizing entry level employees to commit fraud on their behalf"", but it turns out Wells Fargo made almost no money off the fraud- $2m over five years, which hardly seems worth the employees' time, much less the $185m fine. I've left this in as an example of how the incentives-not-orders system doesn't always work in powerful people's favor.</p><p>Thanks to <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9fB4gvoooNYa4t56S/power-buys-you-distance-from-the-crime#Kk4cGe6dQAHiuj9Dn"">Larks</a> for pointing this out.</p><h2>Example 3: Foreign Medical Care</h2><p>My cousin Angela broke her leg while traveling in Thailand, and was delighted by the level of care she received at the Thai hospital-- not just medically, but socially. Nurses brought her flowers and were just generally nicer than their American counterparts. Her interpretation was that Thailand was a place motivated by love and kindness, not money, and Americans should aspire to this level of regard for their fellow human being. My interpretation was that she had enough money to buy the goodwill of everyone in the room without noticing, so what she should have learned is that being rich is awesome, and that being an American who travels internationally is enough to qualify you as rich.</p><p>This is mostly a success story for the free market: Angela got good medical care and the nurses got money (I’m assuming). Any crime in this story were committed off-screen. But Angela was certainly benefiting from the nurses’ restrained choices in life. And had she had actual power to affect healthcare in US, trying to fix it based on what she learned in Thailand would have done a lot of damage.</p><h2>Example 4: My Dating an Artist Experience</h2><p>My starving-artist ex-boyfriend, Connor, stayed with me for two months after a little bad luck and a lot of bad decisions cost him his job and then apartment (this was back when I had a two bedroom apartment to myself-- I miss Seattle). During this time we had one big fight. My view on the fight now is that I was locally in the right but globally the disagreement was indicative of irreconcilable differences that should have led us to break up. That was delayed by months when he capitulated.</p><p>One possibility is that he genuinely thought he could change and that I was worth the attempt. Another is that he saw the incompatibility, or knew things that should have led him to see it, but lied or blocked out the knowledge so that he could keep living with me. This would be a shitty, manipulative thing for him to do. On the other hand, what did I expect? If the punishment for breaking up with me was, best case scenario, moving into a homeless shelter, of course he felt pressure to appease me.&nbsp;</p><p>It wasn’t my fault he felt that pressure, any more than it was Angela’s fault her nurses were born with fewer options than her. Time in my spare bedroom was a gift to him I had no obligation to keep giving. But if I’d really valued a coercion free decision, I would have committed to housing him independent of our relationship. Although if that becomes common knowledge, it just means people can’t make an uncoerced decision to date me at all. And if helping Connor at all meant a commitment to do so forever, he would get a lot less help.</p><p>This case is more like the Wells Fargo case than Amazon or Nike. I was&nbsp;getting only the appearance of what I wanted (a genuine relationship with a compatible person), not the real thing. Nonetheless, the universe was contorting itself to give me the appearance of what I wanted.</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>What all of these stories have in common is that (relatively) powerful people’s desires were met by people less powerful than them, without them having to take responsibility for the action or sometimes even the desire. Society conspired to give them what they wanted (or in the case of Connor and Wells Fargo, a facsimile of what they wanted) without them having to articulate the want, even to themselves. That’s what power <em>means</em>: ability to make the game come out like you want. Disempowered people are forced to consciously notice things (e.g., this budget is unreachable) and make plans (e.g., slavery) where a powerful person wouldn’t. And it’s unfair to judge them for doing so while ignoring the morality of the powerful who never consider the system that brings them such nice things.&nbsp;</p><p>Take home message:</p><ol type=""1""><li><strong>The most agentic person in a situation is not necessarily most morally culpable.

I mean these terms in the sense of the example above: the outcomes may vary tremendously from one another, given the parameters or the approximation. Nevertheless, all the outcomes avoid disasters and are clearly better than maximising a random utility function.</p>

aLhuuNiLCrDCF5QTo,Rethinking Batch Normalization,rethinking-batch-normalization,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/aLhuuNiLCrDCF5QTo/rethinking-batch-normalization,2019-08-02T20:21:16.124Z,20,7,5,False,False,,"<p>Yesterday we saw a glimpse into the inner workings of batch normalization, a popular technique in the field of deep learning. Given that the effectiveness of batch normalization has been demonstrated beyond any reasonable doubt, it may come as a surprise that researchers don&#x27;t really know how it works. At the very least, we sure didn&#x27;t know how it worked when the idea was <em>first</em> proposed. </p><p>One might first consider that last statement to be unlikely. In the last post I outlined a relatively simple theoretical framework for explaining the success of batch normalization. The idea is that batch normalization reduces the internal covariate shift (ICS) of layers in a network. In turn, we have a neural network that is more stable, and robust to large learning rates, and allows much quicker training. </p><p>And this was the standard story in the field for years, until a few researchers decided to actually <a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Fundamental_Question_of_Rationality"">investigate it</a>. </p><p>Here, I hope to convince you that the theory really is wrong. While I&#x27;m fully prepared to make additional epistemic shifts on this question in the future, I also fully expect to never shift my opinion <em>back</em>. </p><p>When I first read the original batch normalization paper, I felt like I really understood the hypothesis. It felt simple enough, was reasonably descriptive, and intuitive. But I didn&#x27;t get a perfect visual of what was going on — I sort of hand-waved the step where ICS contributed to an unstable gradient step. Instead I, like the paper, argued by analogy, that since controlling for covariate shifts were known for decades to help training, a technique to reduce internal covaraite shift is thus a natural extension of this concept.</p><p>It turned out this theory wasn&#x27;t even <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/5bZZZJ5psXrrD5BGb/p/wCqfCLs8z5Qw4GbKS"">a little bit right</a>. It&#x27;s not that covariate shifts aren&#x27;t important <em>at all</em>, but that the entire idea is based on a false premise. </p><p>Or at least, that&#x27;s the impression I got while reading Shibani Santurkar et al.&#x27;s <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.11604"">How Does Batch Normalization Help Optimization?</a><strong> </strong>Whereas the original batch normalization paper gave me a sense of &quot;I kinda sorta see how this works,&quot; this paper completely shattered my intuitions. It wasn&#x27;t just the weight of the empirical evidence, or the theoretical underpinning they present; instead what won me over was the surgical precision of their rebuttal. They saw how to formalize the theory of improvement via ICS reduction and tested it on BatchNorm directly. The theory turned out to be simple, intuitive, and false. </p><p>In fairness, it wasn&#x27;t laziness that prohibited researchers from reaching our current level of understanding. In the original batch normalization paper, the authors indeed proposed a test for measuring batch normalization&#x27;s effect on ICS. </p><p>The problem was instead twofold: their <em>method</em> for measuring ICS was inadequate, and failed to consistently apply their proposed mechanism for how ICS reduction was supposed to work in their testing conditions. More importantly however, they <em>didn&#x27;t even test the theory that ICS reduction contributed to performance gains</em>. Instead their argument was based on a simple heuristic: we <em>know</em> that covariate shifts are bad, we <em>think</em> that batch normalization reduces ICS, and we <em>also</em> know batch normalization increases performance charactersitics<em> </em>— therefore batch normalization works due to ICS reduction. As far as I can tell, most the articles that came after the original paper just took this heuristic at face value, citing the paper and calling it a day. </p><p>And it&#x27;s not a bad heurstic, all in all. But perhaps it&#x27;s a tiny bit telling that on yesterday&#x27;s post, Lesswrong user <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/users/crabman"">crabman</a> was able to anticipate the true reason for batch normalization&#x27;s success, defying both my post and the supposed years that it took researchers to figure this stuff out. Quoth crabman,</p><blockquote>I am imagining this internal covariate shift thing like this: the neural network together with its loss is a function which takes parameters θ as input and outputs a real number. Large internal covariate shift means that if we choose ε&gt;0, perform some SGD steps, get some θ, and look at the function&#x27;s graph in ε-area of θ, it doesn&#x27;t really look like a plane, it&#x27;s more curvy like.</blockquote><p>In fact, the above paragraph doesn&#x27;t actually describe internal covariate shift, but instead the smoothness of the loss function around some parameters <span><style>.mjx-chtml {display: inline-block; line-height: 0; text-indent: 0; text-align: left; text-transform: none; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 100%; font-size-adjust: none; letter-spacing: normal; word-wrap: normal; word-spacing: normal; white-space: nowrap; float: none; direction: ltr; max-width: none; max-height: none; min-width: 0; min-height: 0; border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 1px 0}

I concede, it is perhaps possible that this is really what the original researchers meant when they termed internal covariate shift. It is therefore also possible that this whole critique of the original theory is based on nothing but a misunderstanding.</p><p>But I&#x27;m not buying it. </p><p>Take a look at how the original paper defines ICS,</p><blockquote>We define Internal Covariate Shift as the change in the distribution of network activations due to the change in network parameters during training. </blockquote><p>This definition can&#x27;t merely refer to the smoothness of the gradient around θ. For example, the gradient could be extremely bumpy and have sharp edges and yet ICS could be absent. Can you think of an example of a neural network like this? Here&#x27;s one: think of a network with just one layer whose loss function is some extremely contorted shape because its activation function is some crazy non-linear function. It wouldn&#x27;t be smooth, but its input distribution would be constant over time, given that it&#x27;s only one layer.</p><p>I can instead think of two interpretations of the above definition for ICS. The first interpretation is that ICS simply refers to the change of activations in a layer during training. The second interpretation is that this definition specifically refers to change of activations <em>caused</em> by changes in network parameters at previous layers.</p><p>This is a subtle difference, but I believe it&#x27;s important to understand. The first interpretation allows ease of measurement, since we can simply plot the mean and variance of the input distributions of a layer during training. This is in fact how the paper (section 4.1) tests batch normalization&#x27;s effect on ICS. But really, the second interpretation sounds closer to the hypothesized mechanism for how ICS was supposed to work in the first place. </p><p>On the level of experimentation, the crucial part of the above definition is the part that says &quot;change [...] <em>due </em>to the change in network parameters.&quot; Merely measuring the change in network parameters <em>over time</em> is insufficient. Why? Because the hypothesis was that if activation distributions change too quickly, then a layer will have its gradient pushed into a vanishing or exploding region. In the first interpretation, a change over time could still be slow enough for each layer to adapt appropriately. Therefore, we need additional information to discover whether ICS is occurring in the way that is described. </p><p>To measure ICS under the second interpretation, we have to measure the counterfactual change of parameters — in other words, the amount that the network activations change as a result of other parameters being altered. And we also need a way of seeing whether the gradient is being pushed into extreme regions as a result of these parameters being changed. Only then can we see whether this <em>particular </em>phenomenon is actually occurring.</p><p>The newer paper comes down heavily in favor of this interpretation, and adds a level of formalization on top of it. Their definition focuses on measuring the difference between two different gradients: one gradient with all of the previous layers altered by back propagation, and one gradient where all of the previous layers have been unaltered.

Not only did batch normalization fail to decrease ICS, in some cases it even increased it when compared to naive feedforward neural networks. And to top that off, they found that even in networks where they artificially increased ICS, performance barely suffered.</p><p>In one experiment they applied batch normalization to each hidden layer in a neural network, and at each step, they added noise after the batch normalization transform in order to induce ICS. This noise wasn&#x27;t just Gaussian noise either. Instead they chose the noise such that it was a <em>different</em> Gaussian at every time step and every layer, such that the Gaussian parameters (specifically mean and variance) varied according to a yet another meta Gaussian distribution. What they discovered was that even though this increased measured ICS dramatically, the time it took to train the networks to the baseline accuracy was almost identical to regular batch normalization. </p><p>And remember that batch normalization actually does work. In all of the experiments for mere performance increases, batch normalization has passed the tests with flying colors. So clearly, since batch normalization works, it must be for a different reason than simply reducing ICS. But that leaves one question remaining: how on Earth does it work?</p><p>I have already hinted at the reason above. The answer lies in something even simpler to understand than ICS. Take a look at this plot.</p><br/><span><figure><img src=""https://i.imgur.com/o5R5H0N.png"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:70%"" /></figure></span><p>Imagine the red ball is rolling down this slope, applying gradient descent at each step. And consider for a second that the red ball isn&#x27;t using any momentum. It simply looks at each step which direction to move and moves in that direction in proportion to the slope at that point.</p><p>A problem immediately arises. Depending on how we choose our learning rate, the red ball could end up getting stuck almost immediately. If the learning rate is too slow, then it will probably get stuck on the flat plane to the right of it. And in practice, if its learning rate is too high, then it might move over to another valley entirely, getting itself into an exploding region.</p><p>The way that batch normalization helps is by changing the loss landscape from this bumpy shape into one more like this.</p><span><figure><img src=""https://i.imgur.com/t3f7Xlf.png"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:69%"" /></figure></span><p>Now it no longer matters that much what we set the learning rate to. The ball will be able to find its way down even if its too small. What used to be a flat plane has now been rounded out such that the ball will roll right down. </p><p>The specific way that the paper measures this hypothesis is by applying pretty standard ideas from the real analysis toolkit.

<p>The burden of a rule can be separated into (at least) two components.</p>
<p>First, there’s the direct opportunity cost of not being allowed to do the things the rule forbids. (We can include here the penalties for violating the rule.)</p>
<p>Second, there’s the “cost of compliance”, the effort spent on finding out what is permitted vs. forbidden and demonstrating that you are only doing the permitted things.</p>
<p>Separating these is useful. You can, at least in principle, aim to reduce the compliance costs of a rule without making it less stringent.</p>
<p>For instance, you could aim to simplify the documentation requirements for environmental impact assessments, without relaxing standards for pollution or safety.  “Streamlining” or “simplifying” regulations aims to reduce compliance costs, without necessarily lowering standards or softening penalties.</p>
<p>If your goal in making a rule is to avoid or reduce some unwanted behavior — for instance, to reduce the amount of toxic pollution people and animals are exposed to — then shifting up or down your pollution standards is a zero-sum tradeoff between your environmental goals and the convenience of polluters.</p>
<p>Reducing the costs of compliance, on the other hand, is positive-sum: it saves money for developers, without increasing pollution levels.  Everybody wins. Where possible, you’d intuitively think rulemakers would always want to do this.</p>
<p>Of course, this assumes an idealized world where the only goal of a prohibition is to reduce the total amount of prohibited behavior.</p>
<p>You might want compliance costs to be high if you’re using the rule, not to reduce incidence of the forbidden behavior, but to <em>produce distinctions between people</em> — i.e. to separate the extremely committed from the casual, so you can reward them relative to others.  Costly signals are good if you’re playing a competitive zero-sum game; they induce variance because not everyone is able or willing to pay the cost.</p>
<p>For instance, some theories of sexual selection (such as the handicap principle) argue that we evolved traits which are not beneficial in themselves but are <em>sensitive indicators </em>of whether or not we have other fitness-enhancing traits. E.g. a peacock’s tail is so heavy and showy that only the strongest and healthiest and best-fed birds can afford to maintain it. The tail magnifies variance, making it easier for peahens to distinguish otherwise small variations in the health of potential mates.</p>
<p>Such “magnifying glasses for small flaws” are useful in situations where you need to pick “winners” and can inherently only choose a few. Sexual selection is an example of such a a situation, as females have biological limits on how many children they can bear per lifetime; there is a fixed number of males they can reproduce with.  So it’s a zero-sum situation, as males are competing for a fixed number of breeding slots.  Other competitions for fixed prizes are similar in structure, and likewise tend to evolve expensive signals of commitment or quality.  A test that’s so easy anyone can pass it, is useless for identifying the top 1%.</p>
<p>On a regulatory-capture or spoils-based account of politics, where politics (including regulation) is seen as a negotiation to divide up a fixed pool of resources, and loyalty/trust is important in repeated negotiations, high compliance costs are easy to explain. They prevent diluting the spoils among too many people, and create variance in people’s ability to comply, which allows you to be selective along whatever dimension you care about.</p>
<p>Competitive (selective, zero-sum) processes work better when there’s wide variance among people. A rule (or boundary, or incentive) that’s meant to <em>minimize an undesired behavior</em> is, by contrast, looking at aggregate outcomes. If you can make it easier for people to do the desired behavior and refrain from the undesired, you’ll get better aggregate behavior, all else being equal.  These goals are, in a sense, “democratic” or “anti-elitist”; if you just care about total aggregate outcomes, then you want good behavior to be broadly accessible.</p>
<p><strong>Requiring Permission Raises Compliance Costs </strong></p>
<p>A straightforward way of avoiding undesired behavior is to require people to ask an authority’s permission before acting.</p>
<p>This has advantages: sometimes “undesired behavior” is a complex, situational thing that’s hard to codify into a rule, so the discretional judgment of a human can do better than a rigid rule.</p>
<p>One disadvantage that I think people underestimate, however, is the chilling effect it has on <em>desired </em>behavior.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have to ask the boss’s permission individually for each purchase, no matter how cheap, not only will you waste a lot of your employees’ time, but you’ll disincentivize them from asking for even <em>cost-effective </em>purchases, which can be more costly in the long run.</li>
<li>If you require a doctor’s appointment for giving pain medication every time, to guard against drug abuse, you’re going to see a lot of people who really do have chronic pain doing without medication because they don’t want the anxiety of going to a doctor and being suspected of “drug-seeking”.</li>
<li>If you have to get permission before cleaning or contributing supplies for a shared space, then that space will be chronically under-cleaned and under-supplied.</li>
<li>If you have to get permission from a superior in order to stop the production line to fix a problem, then safety risks and defective products will get overlooked. (This is why Toyota mandated that <em>any </em>worker can <em>unilaterally </em><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomation"">stop the production line</a>.)</li>
</ul>
<p>The inhibition against asking for permission is going to be strongest for shy people who “don’t want to be a bother” — i.e. those who are <em>most </em>conscious of the effects of their actions on others, and perhaps those who you’d most want to <em>encourage</em> to act.  Those who don’t care about bothering you are going to be undaunted, and will flood you with unreasonable requests.  A system where you have to ask a human’s permission before doing anything is an <a href=""https://siderea.livejournal.com/1230660.html""><em>asshole filter</em></a>, in Siderea’s terminology; it empowers assholes and disadvantages everyone else.</p>
<p>The direct costs of a rule fall only on those who violate it (or wish they could); the compliance costs fall on everyone.  A system of enforcement that <em>preferentially </em>inhibits desired behavior (while not being that reliable in restricting undesired behavior) is even worse from an efficiency perspective than a high compliance cost on everyone.</p>
<p><strong>Impersonal Boundaries</strong></p>
<p>An alternative is to instantiate your boundaries in <em>an inanimate object</em> — something that can’t intimidate shy people or cave to pressure from entitled jerks.  For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>a lock on a door is an inanimate boundary on space</li>
<li>a set of password-protected permissions on a filesystem is an inanimate boundary on information access</li>
<li>a departmental budget and a credit card with a fixed spending limit is an inanimate boundary on spending</li>
<li>an electricity source that shuts off automatically when you don’t pay your bill is an inanimate boundary against theft</li>
</ul>
<p>The key element here isn’t information-theoretic simplicity, as in the debate over <a href=""http://www.overcomingbias.com/2019/05/simplerules.html"">simple rules vs. discretion.</a>  Inanimate boundaries can be complex and opaque.  They can be a black box to the user.</p>
<p>The key elements are that, unlike humans, inanimate boundaries <em>do not punish requests that are refused</em> (even socially, by wearing a disappointed facial expression), and they <em>do not give in to repeated or more forceful requests.</em></p>
<p>An inanimate boundary is, rather, like the ideal version of a human maintaining a boundary in an “assertive” fashion; it enforces the boundary reliably and patiently and without emotion.</p>
<p>This way, it produces less inhibition in shy or empathetic people (who hate to make requests that could make someone unhappy) and is less vulnerable to pushy people (who browbeat others into compromising on boundaries.)</p>
<p>In fact, you can get some of the benefits of an inanimate boundary without <em>actually </em>taking a human out of the loop, but just by reducing the bandwidth for social signals. By using email instead of in-person communication, for instance, or by using formalized scripts and impersonal terminology.  Distancing tactics make it easier to refuse requests and easier to make requests; if these effects are roughly the same in magnitude, you get a system that selects more effectively for enabling desired behavior and preventing undesired behavior. (Of course, when you have one permission-granter and many permission-seekers, the effects are <em>not </em>the same in aggregate magnitude; the permission-granter can get spammed by tons of unreasonable requests.)</p>
<p>Of course, if you’re <em>trying </em>to select for transgressiveness — if you <em>want </em>to reward people who are too savvy to follow the official rules and too stubborn to take no for an answer — you’d want to do the opposite; have an automated, impersonal filter to block or intimidate the dutiful, and an extremely personal, intimate, psychologically grueling test for the exceptional. But in this case, what you’ve set up is a competitive <em>test</em> to differentiate between people, not a <em>rule or boundary </em>which you’d like followed as widely as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Consensus and Do-Ocracy</strong></p>
<p>So far, the systems we’ve talked about are centralized, and described from the perspective of an authority figure. Given that you, the authority, want to achieve some goal, how should you most effectively enforce or incentivize desired activity?</p>
<p>But, of course, that’s not the only perspective one might take. You could instead take the perspective that <em>everybody </em>has goals, with no a priori reason to prefer one person’s goals to anyone else’s (without knowing  what the goals are), and model the situation as a <em>group deliberating on how to make decisions</em>.</p>
<p><em>Consensus</em> represents the egalitarian-group version of permission-asking. Before an action is taken, the group must discuss it, and must agree (by majority vote, or unanimous consent, or some other aggregation mechanism) that it’s sufficiently widely accepted.</p>
<p>This has all of the typical flaws of asking permission from an authority figure, with the added problem that groups can take longer to come to consensus than a single authority takes to make a go/no-go decision. Consensus decision processes inhibit action.</p>
<p>(Of course, sometimes that’s exactly what you want. We have jury trials to prevent giving criminal penalties lightly or without deliberation.)</p>
<p>An alternative, equally egalitarian structure is what some hackerspaces call <a href=""https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/Do-ocracy"">do-ocracy.</a></p>
<p>In a do-ocracy, everyone has authority to act, unilaterally. If you think something should be done, like rearranging the tables in a shared space, you do it. No need to ask for permission.</p>
<p>There might be <em>disputes </em>when someone objects to your actions, which have to be resolved in some way.  But this is basically the only situation where governance enters into a do-ocracy. Consensus decisionmaking is an informal version of a legislative or executive body; do-ocracy is an informal version of a <em>judicial system</em>.  Instead of needing governance <em>every time someone acts</em>, in a judicial-only system you only need governance <em>every time someone acts</em> <em>(or states an intention to act) AND </em><em>someone else objects</em>.</p>
<p>The primary advantage of do-ocracy is that it doesn’t slow down actions in the majority of cases where nobody minds.  There’s no friction, no barrier to taking initiative.  You don’t have tasks lying undone because nobody knows “whose job” they are.  Additionally, it grants the most power to the most active participants, which intuitively has a kind of fairness to it, especially in voluntary clubs that have a lot of passive members who barely engage at all.</p>
<p>The disadvantages of do-ocracy are exactly the same as its advantages.  First of all, any action which is potentially harmful and hard to reverse (including, of course, dangerous accidents and violence) can be unilaterally initiated, and do-ocracy cannot prevent it, only remediate it after the fact (or penalize the agent.)  Do-ocracies don’t deal well with very severe, irreversible risks. When they have to, they evolve permission-based functions; for instance, the rules firms or insurance companies institute to prevent risky activities that could lead to lawsuits.</p>
<p>Secondly, do-ocracies grant the most power to the most active participants, which often means those who have the most time on their hands, or who are closest to the action, at the expense of absent stakeholders. This means, for instance, it favors a firm’s executives (who engage in day-to-day activity) over investors or donors or the general public; in volunteer and political organizations it favors those who have more free time to participate (retirees, students, the unemployed, the independently wealthy) over those who have less (working adults, parents).  The general phenomenon here is principal-agent problems — theft, self-dealing, negligence, all cases where the people who are <em>physically there and acting </em>take unfair advantage of the people who are <em>absent and not in the loop, but depend on things remaining okay</em>.</p>
<p>A judicial system doesn’t help those who don’t <em>know </em>they’ve been wronged.</p>
<p>Consensus systems, in fact, are designed to <em>force </em>governance to include or represent all the stakeholders — even those who would, by default, not take the initiative to participate.</p>
<p>Consumer-product companies mostly have do-ocratic power over their users. It’s possible to quit Facebook, with the touch of a button. Facebook changes its algorithms, often in ways users don’t like — but, in most cases, people don’t hate the changes enough to quit.  Facebook makes use of personal data — after putting up a dialog box requesting permission to use it. Yet, some people are dissatisfied and feel like Facebook is too powerful, like it’s hacking into their baser instincts, like this wasn’t what they’d wanted. But Facebook hasn’t <em>harmed </em>them in any way they didn’t, in a sense, consent to. The issue is that <em>Facebook was doing things they didn’t reflectively approve of while they weren’t paying attention. </em>Not <em>secretly — </em>none of this was secret, it just wasn’t on their minds, until suddenly a big media firestorm put it there.</p>
<p>You can get a lot of power to shape human behavior just by showing up, knowing what you want, and enacting it before anyone else has thought about it enough to object. That’s the side of do-ocracy that freaks people out.  Wherever in your life you’re running on autopilot, an adversarial innovator can take a bite out of you and get away with it <em>long before you notice something’s wrong.  </em></p>
<p>This is another part of the appeal of permission-based systems, whether egalitarian or authoritarian; if you have to make a high-touch, human connection with me and get my permission before acting, I’m more likely to notice changes that are bad in ways I didn’t have any prior model of. If I’m sufficiently cautious or pessimistic, I might even be ok with the costs in terms of causing a chilling effect on harmless actions, so long as I make sure I’m sensitive to new kinds of shenanigans that can’t be captured in pre-existing rules.  If I <em>don’t know what I want exactly, but I expect change is bad</em>, I’m going to be much more drawn to permssion-based systems than if I know exactly what I want or if I expect typical actions to be improvements.</p>",sarahconstantin,sarahconstantin,sarahconstantin,

Previous posts:</p><p>1. <a href=""https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/jYMdWskbrTWFXG6dH/a-general-framework-for-evaluating-aging-research-part-1"">A general framework for evaluating aging research. Part 1: reasoning with Longevity Escape Velocity</a></p><p>2. <a href=""https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/uR4mEzMR7fiQzb2c7/aging-research-and-population-ethics"">Aging research and population ethics</a></p><p>3. <a href=""https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/AHajQh7NcJbqZFZh9/impact-of-aging-research-besides-lev"">Impact of aging research besides LEV</a></p><h2>Summary</h2><p>In the first section, I propose a method to scout for impactful and neglected aging research. This method is comprised of two steps: Identifying what is necessary to achieve LEV and, among what is necessary, identifying what is most neglected. This differs from the Open Philanthropy Project&#x27;s approach of ignoring impact derived from Longevity Escape Velocity. A preliminary evaluation, made through including all research on the hallmarks and using lifespan.io&#x27;s <a href=""https://www.lifespan.io/the-rejuvenation-roadmap/"">Rejuvenation Roadmap</a> to identify neglected projects, leads us to identify genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, deregulated nutrient sensing, loss of proteostasis, and mitochondrial dysfunction as neglected and important areas of research. Other neglected research must be scouted in other equally important areas that have already been identified by Open Philanthropy, such as improving delivery methods and developing better biomarkers.</p><p>In the second section, I take Open Philanthropy&#x27;s and Aubrey de Grey&#x27;s stance about considering interventions targeting &quot;aging in general&quot;, such as caloric restriction or metformin, as having low tractability and impact. What remains after this first skimming is translational research focusing on the hallmarks, basic non-translational research, and enabling research, such as developing new tools and delivery methods. When prioritizing inside these areas, tractability should be considered only after having first considered neglectedness while trying to maximize scope by looking at research that is necessary for reaching LEV. Otherwise, a relatively small gain in tractability would sacrifice an extreme amount of impact and neglectedness. This is true because the hardest problems in the field are often the most neglected, but if they are necessary for achieving LEV, they will be solved later, and by accelerating them, we can impact the expected date of LEV the most.</p><h2>A method for evaluating neglectedness</h2><p>In its <a href=""https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/cause-reports/scientific-research/mechanisms-aging#What_are_the_possible_research_interventions"">medium investigation</a> on the cause area of aging, the Open Philanthropy Project identified some scientific advances that it believes would provide years of healthy life extension but still within the range of natural lifespans:</p><ul><li>Preventing the accumulation of epigenetic errors associated with aging or restoring more youthful epigenetic states in cells.</li><li>Solving the problem of senescent cell accumulation.</li><li>Reversing stem cell exhaustion.</li><li>Learning how to use induced pluripotent stem cells (IPSCs) to regenerate and/or replace tissues and organs damaged by aging and aging-related diseases.</li></ul><p>It has also identified research avenues useful for the attainment of the goals stated above:</p><blockquote>Common obstacles to achieving the goals stated above include lack of ability to selectively deliver agents to desired cell types, measure and control the epigenetic state of cells, and understand and control differentiation and functioning of stem cells (plausibly closely related to the previous item). Therefore, progress on these more general themes may assist with extending healthy lifespan. Other types of relatively general research may also be helpful or necessary for substantial extension of healthy lifespan, such as general progress in neuroscience, improved biomarkers for various aspects of aging, and/or improved model organisms for aging.</blockquote><p>By exploring funding and projects in this cause area, it also found two specific neglected interventions:</p><blockquote>We have a limited sense of the absolute and relative neglectedness of the various categories of research discussed in this report. However, our scientific advisors identified specific unfunded projects related to the following themes:</blockquote><blockquote>- Understanding the mechanism(s) driving regeneration associated with heterochronic parabiosis: Experiments have indicated that the blood of older animals can have deleterious effects on younger ones, and that the blood and organ functioning of younger animals can improve the functioning of old ones, though to date the hypothetical increase in healthy lifespan has not been tested. Understanding the biology responsible for the observed effects might eventually lead to interventions that address health problems associated with aging.</blockquote><blockquote>- Aging and epigenetics: Documenting correlations between tissue-specific epigenetic states and signs of aging with a longitudinal cohort study and/or systematic examination of cadavers of people dying at various ages could yield valuable information that could lead to treatments to address aging-related health issues.</blockquote><p>Open Philanthropy&#x27;s way of proceeding is a fruitful one: identifying general impactful avenues and then searching for specific unfunded and underfunded projects.</p><p>If impact is measured in DALYs saved at the end of life, or mild life extension, then this method of proceeding could be optimal. Nonetheless, I propose another method that makes more sense in light of the measure of impact that I propose <a href=""https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/jYMdWskbrTWFXG6dH/a-general-framework-for-evaluating-aging-research-part-1"">in the first post of this series</a>: QALYs saved by making Longevity Escape Velocity come closer.</p><p>Open Philanthropy dismisses the possibility of radical life extension in the next decades, but the timeline in which radical life extension will happen doesn&#x27;t impact the measure of impact that I propose. More importantly, the organization expresses doubts about the desirability of indefinite life extension and its relevance for cost-effectiveness analyses:</p><blockquote>We think the best case for this cause involves the prospect of healthy life extension within the range that some humans currently live.</blockquote><blockquote>[...]</blockquote><blockquote>Our default view is that death and impairment from “normal aging” are undesirable. However, we would have some concerns about indefinite life extension, mainly related to entrenchment of power and culture. We don’t have internal consensus on whether, and to what extent, such indefinite life extension would be desirable, and don’t consider it highly relevant to this write-up.</blockquote><p>Unlike Open Philanthropy, I think that the majority of the impact of aging research comes from making the date of LEV come closer and from the considerations about LEV in general explained in my first post. The reasons for this should be clear by reading the <a href=""https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/jYMdWskbrTWFXG6dH/a-general-framework-for-evaluating-aging-research-part-1"">first</a> and <a href=""https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/AHajQh7NcJbqZFZh9/impact-of-aging-research-besides-lev"">third</a> posts, which are respectively about the impact coming from LEV and the impact coming from preventing DALYs due to age-related diseases.</p><p>Regarding Open Philanthropy&#x27;s concerns about the desirability of &quot;indefinite&quot; life extension: Potential &quot;entrenchment of power and culture&quot; is a negligible inconvenience if compared to the 36,500,000,000 QALYs saved by making LEV come closer by just one year. These figures come up by estimating the length of a life after LEV at 1000 years, although the possibility of it being &quot;indefinite&quot; is undeniable. I think that it&#x27;s also not clear if Open Philanthropy&#x27;s concern would be a new problem at all, given that power, in the form of wealth or not, can already be passed from generation to generation. This concern is also offset by considerations about accumulation of knowledge that would be useful for science and other positive sides of eliminating aging discussed in my previous posts. It could also turn out to be irrelevant due to other disrupting technologies coming along before and after LEV is attained.</p><p>In principle, ignoring a source of impact is going to produce wrong results, since optimizing for one also influences the others.</p><p>Keeping in mind the metric of &quot;QALYs saved by making LEV come closer&quot;, what is a better method of evaluating neglected avenues? Here is the strategy I propose:</p><ul><li>Identify what is necessary to achieve LEV.</li><li>Among what is necessary, identify what is most neglected.</li></ul><p>This method would cause the most difficult problems, which would be solved last if we didn&#x27;t inject more funding, to be solved sooner. In this way, we would probably impact the date of LEV the most. Unlike the strategy proposed by Open Philanthropy, here, the focus is on LEV, and this generates different answers.</p><p>How do we implement the two steps above? Knowledge of the field is necessary. In a preliminary way, we could consider the general avenues identified by Open Philanthropy as necessary advancements. On their own, they are certainly incomplete, and we may actually want to include each one of the hallmarks of aging as described in the <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3836174/"">namesake paper</a>. The causality and interference that the hallmarks have on each other is not yet completely understood, but many of them seem to be individually important enough to require a distinct solution in order to achieve LEV, if not multiple distinct solutions per hallmark.</p><p>Among the hallmarks identified, how do we identify the most neglected? We could look at unfunded projects, as Open Philanthropy has done, or we could search the literature by keywords and look at which hallmark has less research going on about it. An initial good source for identifying the most neglected is also the <a href=""https://www.lifespan.io/the-rejuvenation-roadmap/"">Rejuvenation Roadmap</a>, which is curated by the Life Extension Advocacy Foundation. The most neglected should be the hallmarks in the least advanced stages of research. In theory, this could tell us that they are just difficult instead of neglected, but most of the time, these two things go hand in hand. By looking at it, we immediately identify that two out of four of the general impactful areas identified by Open Philanthropy (cellular senescence and stem cell exhaustion) are actually in the most advanced stages of research. This shouldn&#x27;t be a surprise, since they are, right now, the most fashionable and well funded in the field. Stem cells are probably the most researched topic among the things in the roadmap, and research on senescent cells has exploded in recent years, having seen a surge in private investment on the order of hundreds of millions of dollars (most notably Unity Biotechnology).</p><p>As mentioned, the most neglected problems seem to be the most difficult. This is usually true, because they are too risky to pursue for publicly funded research and too early stage for private investment. However, since they will be the ones that will be solved later in time, they are the ones that will constitute the last barriers for achieving LEV. Therefore, if accelerated, they will actually bring LEV closer in time.</p><p>If we look at the Rejuvenation Roadmap, we can identify these as the most neglected areas: Genomic Instability, Telomere Attrition, Epigenetic Alteration (rightly identified by Open Philanthropy), Deregulated Nutrient Sensing, Loss of Proteostasis, and Mitochondrial Dysfunction.</p><p>But how to evaluate the most neglected topics not described in The Hallmarks of Aging, such as improving delivery methods or developing better biomarkers? Open Philanthropy rightly identified these as important topics, and they are probably necessary for reaching LEV, especially considering that generic therapies that, together, would plausibly address almost every hallmark involve somatic gene therapies that are currently unavailable. In this case, the strategy of looking for important unfunded projects, coupled with a similar approach as the one we use for the hallmarks (searching how many papers there are about each single topic) could be a good strategy. Again, expertise in this field is needed.</p><h2>What is more tractable in aging research, and why tractability starts to lose value after a certain point</h2><p>There seems to be one key consideration about tractability in aging research: addressing aging in general is much more difficult than adopting a divide et impera approach. Quoting Open Philanthropy&#x27;s piece:</p><blockquote>While it is conceivable that there could be treatments addressing aging “in general” (e.g., addressing all or a large proportion of associated symptoms via a single mechanism), such treatments have not been conclusively demonstrated and may not be possible. There are approaches that have been hypothesized to fit in this category, such as caloric restriction. While some of these have been tested in model systems, they have not been tested in humans for the purpose of extending healthy lifespan, and we would guess that they would not have radical effects on healthy lifespan if they were tested (but plausibly could be substantially positive).</blockquote><p>Such interventions target basic mechanisms of aging that are the cause of the damages of aging. Similar approaches are drugs that mimic caloric restriction, or that seem to affect multiple metabolic pathways related to aging, such as the drug metformin. These kind of drugs have small effect sizes, and they delay the onset of age-related diseases. They are difficult to understand due to the intricacy of metabolic pathways and the many unknowns about metabolism in general. Addressing aging by &quot;tinkering&quot; with metabolism is currently not a tractable avenue. In fact, Open Philanthropy focuses on research avenues outside of this area. This is also the argument that biogerontologist Aubrey de Grey makes in favour of the &quot;maintenance approach&quot; to aging: addressing its basic damages (hallmarks) using periodic maintenance, such as by addressing stem cell exhaustion, using senolytics to get rid of senescent cells, etc. instead of focusing on the pathways that originally led to them (the seven damages of his SENS approach are very similar to the nine described in The Hallmarks of Aging). The maintenance approach also theoretically provides rejuvenation - removal of damage - instead of just slowing down its accumulation.</p><p>Starting from this common ground, we can focus on what remains:</p><ul><li>Translational research focusing on the hallmarks.</li><li>Basic non-translational research.</li><li>Enabling research, such as developing new tools and delivery methods, even if it isn&#x27;t strictly classified as aging research.</li></ul><p>What is more tractable inside these three categories? This depends on the specific project evaluated. Trying to locate sub-subareas of tractability in advance is probably not that useful.</p><p>However, should we really be focusing on tractability beyond the first skimming? I believe that now these two metrics should have priority:</p><ul><li>Neglectedness, which correlates with hardness.</li><li>How necessary the given research is for LEV, which drives impact.</li></ul><p>Tractability should be considered after picking the most neglected and necessary projects. Here&#x27;s why:</p><p>As observed earlier, in this area, neglectedness and tractability seem to correlate negatively with each other. This could have a few reasons: the more difficult a given research project is, the riskier it becomes and its results will be particularly far in the future. If a project is too risky and too slow, it will not attract public or private funding and will not be generally attractive to researchers. This is usually the case for hard and ambitious basic research, which is too risky for public funding and too early stage to be profitable for a company. This creates a landscape in which harder problems are neglected. The only way to finance this kind of harder and long term research seems to be through philanthropy.</p><p>Keeping in mind the metric of impact of &quot;making LEV come closer&quot;, it makes more sense to finance hard and neglected problems if they are necessary for achieving LEV. These kind of problems will be solved later than others, therefore accelerating their solution has the most impact on LEV&#x27;s expected date, which is the largest source of impact of aging research by far.</p><p>Because of the nature of the field, if we focused more on tractability, we would have little gain of it (visually, we would add some of it on top of the one gained by the skimming already performed), and, in turn, we would avert some more short-term DALYs. However, by making this choice, we would lose an extreme amount of impact, and we would make a big sacrifice in neglectedness, rendering the tradeoff not worth it.</p><p>In this area, we will rarely see neglected problems that are also very tractable, and while hunting for giving opportunities, we should be on the lookout for projects that are very hard, risky, long term, and underfunded but, at the same time, necessary. By going against the sub-optimal common practice caused by the risk-averse mindset of the field, we can optimize research.</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p><a href=""https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/zQDakLnNumoejXZuX/how-to-evaluate-neglectedness-and-tractability-of-aging"">Crossposted</a> from the EA forum.</p>",emanuele-ascani,emanuele-ascani,emanuele ascani,

They say things like “either the system’s behavior maximizes some utility function, or it is throwing away resources” or “either the system’s behavior maximizes some utility function, or it can be exploited” or things like that. Different theorems use slightly different assumptions and prove slightly different things, e.g. deterministic vs probabilistic utility function, unique vs non-unique utility function, whether the agent can ignore a possible action, etc.</p><p>One theme in these theorems is how they handle “incomplete preferences”: situations where an agent does not prefer one world-state over another. For instance, imagine an agent which prefers pepperoni over mushroom pizza when it has pepperoni, but mushroom over pepperoni when it has mushroom; it’s simply never willing to trade in either direction. There’s nothing inherently “wrong” with this; the agent is not necessarily executing a dominated strategy, cannot necessarily be exploited, or any of the other bad things we associate with inconsistent preferences. But the preferences can’t be described by a utility function over pizza toppings.</p><p>In this post, we’ll see that these kinds of preferences are very naturally described using subagents. In particular, when preferences are allowed to be path-dependent, subagents are important for representing consistent preferences. This gives a theoretical grounding for multi-agent models of human cognition.</p><h2>Preference Representation and Weak Utility</h2><p>Let’s expand our pizza example. We’ll consider an agent who:</p><ul><li>Prefers pepperoni, mushroom, or both over plain cheese pizza</li><li>Prefers both over pepperoni or mushroom alone</li><li>Does not have a stable preference between mushroom and pepperoni - they prefer whichever they currently have</li></ul><p>We can represent this using a directed graph:</p><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/3xF66BNSC5caZuKyC/vn2gt3tu5cugyzip0se4"" srcset=""https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/3xF66BNSC5caZuKyC/oxndico2xyafmnk5ozlv 97w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/3xF66BNSC5caZuKyC/tggbk4ihsv4waxwynlnj 177w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/3xF66BNSC5caZuKyC/huf0nlfdwqheq4zsfs1e 257w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/3xF66BNSC5caZuKyC/ywrcvnh5jahoknqasbhr 337w""></figure><p>The arrows show preference: our agent prefers B over A if (and only if) there is a directed path from A to B along the arrows. There is no path from pepperoni to mushroom or from mushroom to pepperoni, so the agent has no preference between them. In this case, we’re interpreting “no preference” as “agent prefers to keep whatever they have already”. Note that this is NOT the same as “the agent is indifferent”, in which case the agent is willing to switch back and forth between the two options as long as the switch doesn’t cost anything.</p><p>Key point: there is no cycle in this graph. If the agent’s preferences are cyclic, that’s when they provably throw away resources, paying to go in circles. As long as the preferences are acyclic, we call them “consistent”.</p><p>Now, at this point we can still define a “weak” utility function by ignoring the “missing” preference between pepperoni and mushroom. Here’s the idea: a normal utility function says “the agent always prefers the option with higher utility”. A weak utility function says: “<i>if</i> the agent has a preference, then they always prefer the option with higher utility”. The missing preference means we can’t build a normal utility function, but we can still build a weak utility function. Here’s how: since our graph has no cycles, we can always order the nodes so that the arrows only go forward along the sorted nodes - a technique called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting""><u>topological sorting</u></a>. Each node’s position in the topological sort order is its utility. A small tweak to this method also handles indifference.</p><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/3xF66BNSC5caZuKyC/zeuxwh5pfs2khupnztaf"" srcset=""https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/3xF66BNSC5caZuKyC/lisz0r0mo1woar0q75vb 96w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/3xF66BNSC5caZuKyC/bsygpwbhrekdzlvcxjiw 176w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/3xF66BNSC5caZuKyC/zrgygfhgfpkpcvmd0q8y 256w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/3xF66BNSC5caZuKyC/gmagvrwaji2x1alhwhsj 336w""></figure><p>(Note: I’m using the term “weak utility” here because it seems natural; I don’t know of any standard term for this in the literature. Most people don’t distinguish between these two interpretations of utility.)</p><p>When preferences are incomplete, there are multiple possible weak utility functions. For instance, in our example, the topological sort order shown above gives pepperoni utility 1 and mushroom utility 2. But we could just as easily swap them!</p><h2>Preference By Committee</h2><p>The problem with the weak utility approach is that it treats the preference between pepperoni and mushroom as unknown - depending on which possible utility we pick, it could go either way. It’s pretending that there’s some hidden preference there which we simply don’t know. But there are real systems where the preference is not merely unknown, but a real preference to stay in the current state.</p><p>For example, maybe our pizza-agent is actually a committee which must unanimously agree to any proposed change. One member prefers pepperoni to no pepperoni, regardless of mushrooms; the other prefers mushrooms to no mushrooms, regardless of pepperoni. This committee is not exploitable and does not throw away resources, nor does it have any hidden preference between pepperoni and mushrooms. Viewed as a black box, its “true” preference between pepperoni and mushrooms is to keep whichever it currently has.</p><p>In fact, it turns out that we can represent <i>any</i> consistent preferences by a committee requiring unanimous agreement.</p><p>The key idea here is called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_dimension""><u>order dimension</u></a>. We want to take our directed acyclic graph of preferences, and stick it into a multidimensional space so that there is an arrow from A to B if-and-only-if B is higher along <i>all</i> dimensions. Each dimension represents the utility of one subagent on the committee; that subagent approves a change only if the change does not decrease the subagent’s utility. In order for the whole committee to approve a change, the trade must increase (or leave unchanged) the utilities of all subagents. The minimum number of agents required to make this work - the minimum number of dimensions required - is the order dimension of the graph.</p><p>For instance, our pizza example has order dimension 2. We can draw it in a 2-dimensional space like this:</p><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/3xF66BNSC5caZuKyC/xvy2az8fr5ge1mjceuqd"" srcset=""https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/3xF66BNSC5caZuKyC/ursv6upvo2dxnm3udqyr 96w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/3xF66BNSC5caZuKyC/jyu2eccto56kerhskyxs 176w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/3xF66BNSC5caZuKyC/jvxuoqyvxyblzidmzh3m 256w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/3xF66BNSC5caZuKyC/prsocywjprn5f72dyknd 336w""></figure><p>Note that, if there are infinitely many possibilities, then the order dimension can be infinite - we may need infinitely many agents to represent some preferences. But as long as the possibilities are finite, the order dimension will be as well.</p><h2>Path-Dependence</h2><p>So far, we’ve interpreted “missing” preferences as “agent prefers to stay in current state”. One important reason for that interpretation is that it’s exactly what we need in order to handle path-dependent preferences.</p><p>In practice, path-dependent preferences mostly matter for systems with “hidden state”: internal variables which can change in response to the system’s choices. A great example of this is financial markets: they’re the ur-example of efficiency and inexploitability, yet it turns out that a market does not have a utility function in general (economists call this “<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_agent""><u>nonexistence of a representative agent</u></a>”). The reason is that the distribution of wealth across the market’s agents functions as an internal hidden variable. Depending on what path the market follows, different internal agents end up with different amounts of wealth, and the market as a whole will hold different portfolios as a result - even if the externally-visible variables, i.e. prices, end up the same.</p><p>Most path-dependence results from some hidden state directly, but even if we don’t know the hidden state, we can always add hidden state in order to model path-dependence. Whenever future preferences differ based on how the system reached the current state, we just split the state into two states - one for each possibility. Then we repeat, until we have a full set of states with path-independent preferences between them. These new states are “full” states of the system; from outside, some of them look the same.</p><p>An example: suppose I prefer New York to Boston if I just came from DC, but Boston to New York if I just came from Philadelphia.</p><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/3xF66BNSC5caZuKyC/fey8bzuo4yczqstj1oea"" srcset=""https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/3xF66BNSC5caZuKyC/ecy8vs2joeozacfeaj6d 81w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/3xF66BNSC5caZuKyC/i3aio9pjlipmbdsgu8nn 161w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/3xF66BNSC5caZuKyC/o8cexd21b02t4b0sj2r8 241w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/3xF66BNSC5caZuKyC/gxqqr4tpulxponyssbph 321w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/3xF66BNSC5caZuKyC/hb2dingnnmvwhf2gaiw2 401w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/3xF66BNSC5caZuKyC/gtroake6fuvhjqfkul8z 481w""></figure><p>We can represent that with hidden state:</p><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/3xF66BNSC5caZuKyC/jgxb4qanqgrq85u5yrbw"" srcset=""https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/3xF66BNSC5caZuKyC/qtsdqnvxr1njs9d8ykpq 80w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/3xF66BNSC5caZuKyC/eayxrwht1qwexoxeenaj 160w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/3xF66BNSC5caZuKyC/bbbat9btjoifdw1gywpe 240w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/3xF66BNSC5caZuKyC/vusw2wvxcjxzhhgqogox 320w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/3xF66BNSC5caZuKyC/ffd4r8oecmkkdpzhgie8 400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/3xF66BNSC5caZuKyC/vavvlri6eqay4wmtblgt 480w""></figure><p>We now have two separate hidden internal nodes, which both correspond to the same externally-visible state “New York”.</p><p>Now the key piece: there is no way to get to the “New York (from Philly)” node directly from the “New York (from DC)” node. The agent does not, and cannot, have a preference between these two nodes. Analogously, a market cannot have a preference between two different wealth distributions - the subagents who comprise a market will never spontaneously decide to redistribute their wealth amongst themselves. They always “prefer” (or “decide”) to stay in whatever state they’re currently in.</p><p>This is why we need to understand incomplete preferences in order to handle path-dependent preferences: hidden state creates situations where the agent “prefers” to stay in whatever state they’re in.</p><p>Now we can easily model the system using subagents exactly as we did for incomplete preferences. We have a directed preference graph between full states (including hidden state), it needs to be acyclic to avoid throwing away resources, so we can find a set of subagents to represent the preferences. In the case of a market, this is just the subagents which comprise the market: they’ll take a trade if it does not decrease the utility of any subagent. (Note, however, that the same externally-visible trade can correspond to multiple possible internal state changes; the subagents will take the trade if any of the possible internal state changes are non-utility-decreasing for all of them. For a market, this means they can trade amongst themselves in response to the external trade in order to make everyone happy.)</p><h2>Applications &amp; Speculations</h2><p>We’ve just argued that a system with consistent preferences can be modelled as a committee of utility-maximizing agents. How does this change our interpretation and predictions of the world?</p><p>First and foremost: the subagents argument is a generalization of the standard acyclic preferences argument. Anytime we might want to use the acyclic preferences argument, but there’s no reason for the system to be path-independent, we can apply the subagents argument instead. In practice, we usually expect systems to be efficient/inexploitable because of some selection pressure (evolution, market competition, etc) - and that selection pressure usually doesn’t care about path dependence in and of itself.</p><p>Main takeaway: pretty much anywhere we’d use an agent with a utility function to model something, we can apply the subagents argument and use a committee of agents with utility functions instead. In particular, this is a good replacement for ""weak"" utility functions.</p><p>Humans are a particularly interesting example. We’d normally use the acyclic preferences argument (among other arguments) to argue that humans approximate utility-maximizers in most situations. But there’s no particular reason to assume path-independence; indeed, human behavior <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/pmHZDpak4NeRLLLCw""><u>looks highly path-dependent</u></a>. So, apply the subagents argument. Hypothesis: human behavior approximates the choices of a committee of utility-maximizing agents in most situations.</p><p><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/ZbmRyDN8TCpBTZSip""><u>Sound familiar</u></a>? The subagents argument offers a theoretical basis for the idea that humans have lots of internal subagents, with competing wants and needs, all constantly negotiating with each other to decide on externally-visible behavior.</p><p>In principle, we could test this hypothesis more rigorously. Lots of people think of AI “learning what humans want” by asking questions or offering choices or running simulations. Personally, I picture an AI taking in a scan of a full human connectome, then directly calculating the embedded preferences. Someday, this will be possible. When the AI solves those equations, do we expect it to find a single generic optimizer embedded in the system, approximately optimizing some “utility”? Or do we expect to find a bunch of separate generic optimizers, approximately optimizing several different “utilities”, and negotiating with each other? Probably neither picture is complete yet, but I’d bet the second is much closer to reality.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Let’s recap:</p><ul><li>The acyclic preferences argument is the easiest entry point for efficiency/inexploitability-implies-utility-maximization theorems, but it doesn’t handle lots of important things, including path dependence.</li><li>Markets, for example, are efficient/inexploitable but can’t be represented by a utility function. They have hidden internal state - the distribution of wealth over agents - which makes their preferences path-dependent.</li><li>The subagents argument says that <i>any</i> system with deterministic, efficient/inexploitable preferences can be represented by a committee of utility-maximizing agents - even if the system has path-dependent or incomplete preferences.</li><li>That means we can substitute committees in many places where we currently use utilities. For instance, it offers a theoretical foundation for the idea that human behavior is described by many negotiating subagents.</li></ul><p>One big piece which we haven’t touched at all is uncertainty. An obvious generalization of the subagents argument is that, once we add uncertainty (and a notion of efficiency/inexploitability which accounts for it), an efficient/inexploitable path-dependent system can be represented by a committee of Bayesian utility maximizers. I haven’t even started to tackle that conjecture yet; it’s a wide-open problem.</p>",johnswentworth,johnswentworth,johnswentworth,

<p>This post discusses why any halfer position in the Sleeping Beauty Problem would lead to disagreements between two agents sharing all information. This issue has not been much discussed except by <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ba5tzwNTdgxb5vJWF/agreement-on-anthropics"">@Katja Grace</a> and <a href=""http://www.johnpittard.com/John_Pittard/Research_files/Pittard.%20When%20Beauties%20Disagree.pdf"">John Pittard</a>. Furthermore I would explain why these seemingly absurd disagreements are actually valid. This post is another attempt by me trying to get attention to the important difference between reasoning as the first person versus reasoning as an impartial observer in anthropic problems.</p>
<h1>The Disagreement</h1>
<p>To show any halfer position would lead to disagreements between two communicating agents consider this problem:</p>
<p><em><strong>Bring a Friend</strong>: You and one of your friend are participating in a cloning experiment. After you fall asleep the experimenter would toss a fair coin. If it lands Heads nothing happens. If it lands Tails you would be cloned and the clone would be put into an identical room. The cloning process is highly accurate such that it retains the memory to a level of fidelity that is humanly indistinguishable. As a result, next morning after waking up there is no way to tell if you are physically the original or the clone. Your friend wouldn’t be cloned in any case. The next morning she would choose one of the two rooms to enter. Suppose your friend enters your room. How should she reason the probability of Heads? How should you reason?</em></p>
<p>For the friend this is not an anthropic problem. So her answer shouldn’t be controversial. If the coin landed Heads she has 50% chance of seeing an occupied room. While if the coin landed Tails both room would be occupied. Therefore seeing me in the room is evidence favouring Tails. She would update the probability of Heads to 1/3.</p>
<p>From my (the participant’s) perspective this is a classical anthropic problem just like Sleeping Beauty. There are two camps. Halfers would say the probability of Heads is 1/2. Reason being I knew I would find myself in this situation. Therefore I haven’t gained any new information about the coin toss. The probability must remain unchanged. The other camp says the probability of Heads should actually be 1/3. Most thirders argue I have gained the new information that <em>I</em> exist which is evidence favouring more copies of the participants exist. Therefore the probability of Tails shall increase from the prior.</p>
<p>Both camps should agree that seeing the friend (or not) would not change their answer. Because the friend is simply choosing one room out of the two. Regardless of coin toss result there is always a 50% chance for her to enter my room.</p>
<p>Now Halfers are in a peculiar situation. My probability of Heads is 1/2 while the friend’s answer is 1/3. We can share our information and communicate any way we like. Nothing I say can change her answer as nothing she says can change mine. To make the matter even more interesting I would have to admit there is no mistake in my friend’s reasoning and she would think I am correct too. Our difference is purely due to the differences in perspectives. This seems to contradict Aumann’s Agreement Theorem.</p>
<p>Thirders do not have any of these problems. The friend and I would be in perfect agreement that the probability is 1/3. As a result this issue is occasionally used as a counter to Halferism (as did so by <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ba5tzwNTdgxb5vJWF/agreement-on-anthropics"">Katja Grace</a> even though that post targets SSA specifically her argument applies to all halfers). However I would like to argue these disagreements are indeed valid.</p>
<h1>Repeating the Experiment as the Friend vs as the Participant</h1>
<p>Re-experiencing the experiment as the friend is not the same as re-experiencing it as a participant. From the friend’s perspective repeating it is straightforward. Let another coin toss and potential cloning happen to someone else and then choose a random room again. It is easy to see if the number of repetition is large she would see the chosen room occupied about 3/4 of the times. Out of which about 1/3 of the meetings would be after Heads. The relative frequency agrees with her answer of 1/3.</p>
<p>To repeat the experiment from my first-person perspective is a different story. After waking up from the first experiment (and potentially meeting my friend) I would simply participate in the same process again. I shall fall asleep and let another coin toss and potential cloning take place. I would wake up again not knowing if I’m the same physical person the day before. Suppose I’m told the coin toss result at the end of each day. If this is repeated a large number of times then I would count about 1/2 of the awakenings following Heads. I would also meet my friend 1/2 of the times, with about equal numbers after heads or tails. My relative frequency of Heads would be 1/2, agreeing with my answer.</p>
<p>In tosses involving both my friend and me she may see the other copy of participant instead of <em>me</em> specifically after Tails. This caused our difference in answers. Which leads to our different interpretation of:</p>
<h1>Who is in this Meeting</h1>
<p>From the friend’s perspective choosing a random room have two possible outcomes. Either the chosen room is empty or it is occupied. The new information she received is simply there is someone in the room. She interprets that person as an unspecific participant.</p>
<p>On the other hand from my perspective the person in the room is specific, i.e. <em>me</em>. The possible outcome for the room selection is either <em>I</em> see the friend or <em>I</em> do not see the friend. There may or may not exist another version of participant who is highly similar to me but that would not affect my observation.</p>
<p>Effectively we are answering two different questions. For my friend “what is the probability of Heads given there is a version of participant in the chosen room”. For me “what is the probability of Heads given <em>I</em> specifically am in the chosen room”. In this sense the disagreement does not violate Aumann’s Agreement Theorem.</p>
<p>A point to note: the specification of <em>I</em> is limited to my first-person perspective. It is incommunicable. I can keep telling my friend “It’s me” yet it would carry no information to her. Because this specification has nothing to do with objective differences between <em>me</em> and other copies of the participant. I refer this person as <em>me</em> only because I’m experiencing the world from its perspective. Because this person is undeniably most immediate to the only subjective experience and consciousness accessible. Identifying <em>me</em> is primitive. Which begs the question:</p>
<h1>Can Indexicals Be Used In Anthropics?</h1>
<p>Indexicals (or pure indexicals by some definition) such as <em>I</em>, <em>here</em>, <em>now</em> and by extension <em>we</em>, <em>today</em> or even <em>this world</em> is a point of contention between halfers and thirders. Typically thirders think indexicals can be used in anthropic reasoning while halfers disagree. In the Sleeping Beauty Problem this conflict manifest in the debate of new information. Most thirders think there is new information since I learned I am awake on one specific day, i.e. <em>today</em>. Halfers typically argue the indexical <em>today</em> is not an objective specification and it can only be said I am awake on an unknown day, i.e. there is at least one awakening. In the cloning example above thirders think the new information is a specific participant <em>I</em> exist whereas halfers often argue objectively speaking it only shows at least one participant exists.</p>
<p>The disagreement between participant and friend presents another explanation for the indexicals. <strong>Indexicals are references to the <em>perspective center</em></strong>. When someone says <em>here</em> he is talking about the location where he is experiencing the world from, the place most immediate to the subjective experience. Similarly <em>I</em> and <em>now</em> points to other aspects of the <strong>perspective center</strong>. They refer to the agent and time most immediate to the subjective experience respectively. Because it is only related to the perspective a participant can intrinsically identify <em>I</em> and never confuse himself with others. He can do this without knowing any difference between him and other highly similar participants. Also because of this dependency on the perspective this identification is not meaningful to the friend. Which lead to their disagreement.</p>
<p>By this logic the use of indexicals in anthropic problems is valid, that is, as long as we are reasoning from the first-person perspective of a participant. The debate of their usage is a debate between perspectives. When thirders say <em>today</em> is a specific day it requires us to imagine being in beauty’s shoes wakening up in the experiment. Halfers oppose <em>today</em>’s use because they are reasoning as an outsider. In which case some objective measure is required to differentiate the two days. This shows the conflicting logics between an-</p>
<h1>Impartial Observer vs the First Person</h1>
<p>We often purposely formulate our logics in a way so it is not from any specific perspective. As if the perspective center is irrelevant to the problem at hand, i.e. we reason as (imaginary) impartial observers would. This uncentered reasoning would not treat any agent, time or location as inherently special. It is what we usually meant as thinking objectively. Comparing to first-person reasoning it is different in several aspects.</p>
<p>The obvious difference is the aforementioned use of indexicals. Impartial observers’ uncentered reasoning cannot use indexicals since they are references to the perspective center. For most problems this simply means substituting the indexical <em>I</em> to a third-person identity in logical expressions. Similarly <em>now</em> and <em>here</em> are switched to some objectively identified time and location. For anthropic problems however this has further implications because the ability to inherently identify oneself affects reasoning as shown by the disagreement between the participant and the friend.</p>
<p>Another difference is about one’s uniqueness. The indexicals as references to the perspective center are inherently special. From the first-person perspective <em>I</em> am one of a kind. Other agents, no matter how physically similar, are not its logical equals. This explains why as the first person <em>I</em> can be identified without knowing any difference between <em>I</em> and others. The differentiation is not needed because they are never in the same category to begin with. The same is true for <em>now</em> and <em>here</em>. On the other hand for an impartial outsider no agent, time or location is inherently special, i.e. they are indifferent.</p>
<p>The last difference is the probability of existence. The existence of <em>I</em> is a logical truth. Because to use the indexicals one has to reason from the first-person perspective. Yet reasoning from its perspective could only conclude in its self-existence, i.e. “I think, therefore I am”. It is sometimes presented as “ I can only find myself exist.” Furthermore given reasoned from a consistent perspective, “<em>I</em> am, <em>here</em>, <em>now</em>” would always be true. Because these indexicals refer to different aspects of the same perspective center. On the other hand we can also reason as impartial observers and specify a participant or time by some third-person identifiable measures. In this case it is entirely possible that agent does not exist or not conscious at the specified time. E.g. in the previous cloning example we can identify a participant as the one in the chosen room. It is possible that he does not exist since the chosen room can be potentially empty. In summary, it takes an outsiders’ perspective to think about someone’s nonexistence/unconsciousness.</p>
<p>Given these differences, logics from the first person and impartial outsiders should not mix in anthropic related problems. However most arguments in this field paid no attention to these distinctions. It is my core argument that anthropic paradoxes are caused by arbitrarily switching perspectives in reasoning, mixing the conflicting logics.</p>
<h1>Paradoxes and Mixed Reasoning</h1>
<p>To recap: the first-person perspective is centered. It can use indexicals because <em>I</em>, <em>here</em> and <em>now</em> are inherently special comparing to other agents, locations or time.  Where “<em>I</em> exist, <em>here</em> and <em>now</em>” is a logical truth. On the other hand the impartial observers’ perspective is uncentered. Indexicals cannot be used because impartial observers are indifferent to any agent, time or location. Where the existence of any specific agents at any time or location is not guaranteed. <strong>Within a single logical framework we can employ either perspective, but not both.</strong> If an argument mixes the two, paradoxes ensue.</p>
<p>Take the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_argument"">Doomsday Argument</a> as an example. It suggests we should take a more pessimistic outlook for human’s future than observed evidence suggests. The argument is simple. First, it recognizes a principle of indifference among all human beings (past, present or future alike). Then it specifically considers <em>my</em> birth rank among all humans (sometimes it is expressed as <em>our</em> birth rank or that of the <em>current</em> generation). As a result it concludes <em>I</em> am more likely to have <em>my</em> birth rank if there are fewer people in total, i.e. doom soon is more likely. This is a classic case of mixed perspectives. On one hand it treats all human beings indifferently as an impartial outsider would. Yet at the same time it uses indexicals by employing a first-person perspective and take a special interest in <em>my</em> or by extension <em>our</em> birth rank. Only by mixing the two it enables the conditional update shifting the probability to doom soon. If we reason as the first person and identify the indexical <em>I</em> by treating it as inherently special then the principle of indifference among all humans no longer applies. Similarly if we reason as an impartial outsider and recognize the principle of indifference then there is no reason to consider <em>my</em> birth rank specifically, in fact there is no way to identify <em>I</em> to begin with. Either way, the outlook of mankind can only be estimated by observed evidence. The probability shift is false.</p>
<p>Interestingly on some level we realize the inherently apparent <em>I</em> and the indifferent principle to all humans are not logically consistent. To reconcile this conflict a conscious step is often added: anthropic assumptions, which suggests treating <em>I</em> as a randomly selected individual among indifferent agents. Even though there is no justification to such assumptions accepting them feels natural. Because they allow two highly intuitive ideas to coexist. However, those two ideas are based on different perspectives which should be kept separate to begin with.</p>
<p>An example is the Self-Sampling Assumption (SSA). It suggests we should reason as if <em>I</em> am randomly selected from all <em>actually</em> existent (past, present or future) observers. This would lead to the infamous Doomsday Argument. An alternative to the SSA is the Self-Indication Assumption (SIA). It suggests we should reason as if <em>I</em> am randomly selected from all <em>potentially</em> existent observers. While it would refute the Doomsday Argument it has its own paradox: <a href=""http://www.anthropic-principle.com/preprints/mys/mysteries.pdf"">the Presumptuous Philosopher</a>. (It concludes the number of intelligent life-forms in the universe should be higher than observed evidence suggests. Due to the fact that <em>I</em> exist is evidence favouring more observers.) The debate between SSA and SIA is about the correct reference class of <em>I</em>, whether it should be all existent or possible observers. Yet if the perspective reasonings are not mixed this problem would never exist in the first place. There is no default reference class for <em>I</em> since right from the start it is never in the same category with other observers, let it be actual or potential.</p>
<p>No default reference class also means any notions of the probability distribution of <em>me</em> being members of the said reference class are false. Such probabilities do not exist. Consider the paradox related to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_brain"">Boltzmann Brain</a>. Some arguments suggest that under current theories of universe Boltzmann brains would vastly outnumber human brains in the universe. Then the probability of <em>me</em> being a Boltzmann brain is almost 100%. Essential to this calculation is a principle of indifference among all brains, which is valid if reasoned as an impartial observer. Yet it also specifically considers the first-person center <em>I</em> which contradict the indifference. As a result the probability it trying to calculate is logically inconsistent to begin with. There is no answer to it. Instead of using the indexical <em>I</em> the brain in question shall be specified from impartial observers’ perspective. E.g. A randomly selected one among all brains would almost 100% being a Boltzmann brain. This calculation would be correct. But also way less interesting. The same principle also refutes Nick Bostrom’s <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_hypothesis"">Simulation Hypothesis</a>.</p>
<p>The non-existence of such probabilities can also be shown by the frequentist interpretation. Recall in the cloning example, I (participant) can re-experience the experiment as the first person. From my perspective after taking part in a large number of iterations the relative frequency of Heads or seeing my friend would both approach a certain value (1/2). However there is no reason for the relative frequency of <em>me</em> being the clone or the original of each experiment to converge toward any particular value. This again suggests such probabilities do not exist. Instead of using indexicals a participant must be specified from impartial observers’ perspective. Only then it is valid to ask the probability of this individual being the original or clone. E.g. the probability that the participant in the chosen room (if it exists) being the original is valid. A relative frequency can be calculated by an outsider without having to take a participant’s first-person perspective.</p>
<h1>Sleeping Beauty Paradox and Conclusion</h1>
<p>The Sleeping Beauty Paradox is without a doubt the most debated problem in anthropic reasoning. Nonetheless the same principle applies. The answer to it can be derived either from beauty’s first-person perspective or from impartial observers’ perspective. From the first-person perspective I have gained no new information. I did find myself awake <em>today</em> specifically. Yet that is just a logical truth in first-person reasoning. So even before falling asleep on Sunday it is already known that I would wake up in the experiment and identify that day as <em>today</em>. The probability of Heads remains at 1/2. From impartial observers’ perspective there is no new information either. While beauty being awake on a specific day is not guaranteed from this perspective, it could not use beauty’s perspective center to specify <em>today</em>. So all that is known is there is an unspecific awakening, i.e. there is at least one awakening. The probability of Heads should remain at 1/2 as well.</p>
<p>More importantly “the probability of <em>today</em> being Monday”, or “the probability of <em>this awakening</em> being the first” do not exist. Because they use indexicals in some default reference class (actual awakenings or potential awakenings) which is inconsistent. No Bayesian updating shall be performed after learning “Today is Monday”. The probability of Heads is 1/2 at awakening and remains at 1/2 after beauty finds out it is Monday.</p>
<p>In conclusion, perspectives play a significant role in anthropic related problems. Different perspectives could potentially give completely different answers. Most notably the special interest to the perspective center of the first-person and the general indifference of impartial observers are not compatible​. Reasoning from these two perspectives​ must be kept separate to avoid paradoxes.</p>

This is useful for training because we don&#x27;t want the gradient descent step to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanishing_gradient_problem"">vanish or blow up</a>. Batch normalization accomplishes this because the weights no longer have an incentive to grow to extremely large or small values. In the process, batch normalization therefore also increases our ability to train with activations like the sigmoid, which were previously known to fall victim to vanishing gradients.</p><p>I will borrow an example from the <a href=""https://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/optimization.html"">Deep Learning Book</a> (section 8.7.1) to illustrate the central issue, and how we can use batch normalization to fix it.

And since this network is so deep, the effects of an update to one layer may dramatically affect the other layers. For example, whereas an appropriate learning rate at one layer might be <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""0.001""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mn""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">0.001</span></span></span></span></span></span>, this might simultaneously cause a vanishing gradient at some another layer! </p><p>Previous approaches to dealing with this problem focused on adjusting <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\epsilon""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">ϵ</span></span></span></span></span></span> at each layer in order to ensure that the effect of the gradient was small enough to cancel out the large product, while remaining large enough to learn something useful. In practice, this is quite a difficult problem. The <em>n</em>-order terms which affect the output are too numerous for any reasonably quick model to take into account all of them. By using this technique, the only options we have left are to shrink the model so that there are few layers, or to slow down our gradient computation excessively. </p><p>The above difficulty of coordinating gradients between layers is really a specific case of a more general issue which arises in deep neural networks. In particular, the issue is termed an <em>internal covariate shift</em> by <a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03167.pdf"">the original paper</a>. In general a <em>covariate shift</em> refers to a scenario in which the input distribution for some machine learning model changes. Covariate shifts are extremely important to understand for machine learning because it is difficult to create a model which can generalize beyond the input distribution that it was trained on. Internal covariate shifts are covariate shifts that happen within the model itself.</p><p>Since neural networks can be described as function compositions, we can write a two layer feedforward neural network as <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""f_2(f_1(x, \theta_1), \theta_2)""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base"" style=""margin-right: -0.06em;""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.519em; padding-right: 0.06em;"">f</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mn"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">2</span></span></span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">(</span></span><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base"" style=""margin-right: -0.06em;""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.519em; padding-right: 0.06em;"">f</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mn"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">1</span></span></span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">(</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">x</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""margin-top: -0.144em; padding-bottom: 0.519em;"">,</span></span><span class=""mjx-msubsup MJXc-space1""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">θ</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mn"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">1</span></span></span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">)</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""margin-top: -0.144em; padding-bottom: 0.519em;"">,</span></span><span class=""mjx-msubsup MJXc-space1""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">θ</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mn"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">2</span></span></span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">)</span></span></span></span></span></span> where <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""x""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">x</span></span></span></span></span></span> is the input to the network, and <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\theta""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">θ</span></span></span></span></span></span> defines the parameters at each layer.

This has the effect of partially canceling out assumption of we are making about the gradient, which is that each element of the gradient is defined as the the rate of change of a parameter <em>with everything else held constant</em>. Gradients are only defined as measuring some slope over an infinitesimal region of space — and in our case, we are only estimating the gradient using stochastic mini-batch descent. This implies that we should automatically assume that this basic assumption for our gradient estimate will be false in practice. Even still, a difference in the way that we approach the gradient calculation can help alleviate this problem to a large degree.</p><p>One way to alleviate the issue would be to encourage each layer to output similar distributions across training steps. For instance, we <em>could</em> try to add a penalty to the loss function to encourage the activations from each layer to more closely resemble a Gaussian distribution, in particular the <em>same</em> Gaussian at each step during the training process, like a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitening_transformation"">whitened distribution</a>. This would have the intended effect of keeping the underlying distribution of each layer roughly similar across training steps, minimizing the downsides of internal covariate shift. However this is an unnecessarily painful approach, since it is difficult to design a loss penalty which results in the exact desired change.</p><p>Another alternative is to modify the parameters of a layer after each gradient descent step in order to point them in a direction that will cause their output to be more Gaussian. Experiments attempting this technique resulted in neural networks that would waste time repeatedly proposing an internal covariate shift only to be reset by the intervention immediately thereafter (see section 2 in <a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03167.pdf"">the paper</a>). </p><p>The solution that the field of deep learning has settled on is roughly to use batch normalization as described above, and to take the gradients while carefully taking into account these equations. The batch normalization directly causes the input activations to resemble a Gaussian, and since we are using backpropagation through these equations, we don&#x27;t need any expensive tug of war with the parameters.</p><p>One more step is however needed in order to keep the layers from losing their representation abilities after having their output distributions normalized.</p><p>Once we have obtained the batch of normalized activations <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""H'""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msup""><span class=""mjx-base"" style=""margin-right: -0.057em;""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.057em;"">H</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sup"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: 0.513em; padding-left: 0.176em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mo"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.298em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">′</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>, we in fact use <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\gamma H' + \beta""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.519em; padding-right: 0.025em;"">γ</span></span><span class=""mjx-msup""><span class=""mjx-base"" style=""margin-right: -0.057em;""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.057em;"">H</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sup"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: 0.513em; padding-left: 0.176em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mo"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.298em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">′</span></span></span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space2""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.298em; padding-bottom: 0.446em;"">+</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi MJXc-space2""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.446em; padding-right: 0.007em;"">β</span></span></span></span></span></span> as the input for the layer, where <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\gamma""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.519em; padding-right: 0.025em;"">γ</span></span></span></span></span></span> and <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\beta""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.446em; padding-right: 0.007em;"">β</span></span></span></span></span></span> are learned scalar parameters.

As William put it: &quot;Entities should not be multiplied without necessity&quot;. Or, as Einstein reformulated it 600 years later: &quot;Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler&quot;. </p><p>Occam&#x27;s Razor, as it became known, was enthusiastically adopted by the scientific community and remains the unquestioned criterion for deciding between alternative hypotheses to this day. In my opinion, its success is traceable to two characteristics:</p><p>o Utility: OR is not a logical deduction. Neither is it a statement about which hypothesis is most likely. Instead, it is a procedure for selecting a theory which makes further work as easy is possible. And by facilitating work, we can usually advance further and faster. </p><p>o Combinability.  OR is fully compatible with each the epistemological stances which have been adopted within science from time to time (empiricism, rationalism, positivism, falsifiability, etc.)</p><p>It is remarkable that such a widely applied principle is exercised with so little thought to its interpretation. I thought of this recently upon reading an article claiming that the multiverse interpretation of quantum mechanics is appealing because it is so simple. <em>Really??</em> The multiverse explanation proposes the creation of an infinitude of new universes at every instant. To me, that makes it an egregiously complex hypothesis. But if someone decides that it is simple, I have no basis for refutation, since the notion of what it means for a theory to be simple has never been specified. </p><p>What do we mean when we call something simple? My naive notion is to begin by counting parts and features. A milling device made up of two stones, one stationary one mobile, fitted with a stick for rotation by hand becomes more complex when we add devices to capture and transmit water power for setting the stone in motion. And my mobile phone becomes more complex each time I add a new app. But these notions don&#x27;t serve to answer the question whether Lagrange&#x27;s formulation of classical mechanics, based on action, is simpler than the equivalent formulation by Newton, based on his three laws of forces.</p><p>Isn&#x27;t remarkable that scientists, so renown for their exactitude, have been relying heavily on so vague a principle for 700 years?</p><p>Can we do anything to make it more precise?</p>",Jimdrix_Hendri,jimdrix_hendri,Jimdrix_Hendri,
k3MhrQewcHziu3PHS,Mistake Versus Conflict Theory of Against Billionaire Philanthropy,mistake-versus-conflict-theory-of-against-billionaire,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/k3MhrQewcHziu3PHS/mistake-versus-conflict-theory-of-against-billionaire,2019-08-01T13:10:01.408Z,37,26,34,False,False,,"<p>Response To (SlateStarCodex): <a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/07/29/against-against-billionaire-philanthropy/"">Against Against Billionaire Philanthropy</a></p>
<p>I agree with all the central points in Scott Alexander’s <a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/07/29/against-against-billionaire-philanthropy/"">Against Against Billionaire Philanthropy</a>. I find his statements accurate and his arguments convincing. I have quibbles with specific details and criticisms of particular actions.</p>
<p>He and I disagree on much regarding the right ways to be effective, whether or not it is as an altruist. None of that has any bearing on his central points.</p>
<p>We violently agree that it is highly praiseworthy and net good for the world to use one’s resources in attempts to improve the world. And that if we criticize rather than praise such actions, we will get less of them.</p>
<p>We also violently agree that one should direct those resources towards where one believes they would do the most good, to the best one of one’s ability. One should not first giving those resources to an outside organization one does not control and which mostly does not use resources wisely or aim to make the world better, in the hopes that it can be convinced to use those resources wisely and aim to make the world better.</p>
<p>We again violently agree that privately directed efforts of wealthy individuals often do massive amounts of obvious good, on average are much more effective, and have some of the most epic wins of history to their names. Scott cites only the altruistic wins and effectiveness here, which I’d normally object to, but which in context I’ll allow.</p>
<p>And so on.</p>
<p>Where we disagree is <em>why anyone is opposing billionaire philanthropy. </em></p>
<p></p>
<p>We disagree that Scott’s post <em>is a useful thing to write. </em>I agree with everything he says, but expect it to convince <em>less than zero people </em>to support his position.</p>
<p>Scott laid out our disagreement in his post <a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/01/24/conflict-vs-mistake/"">Conflict vs. Mistake</a>.</p>
<p>Scott is a mistake theorist. That’s not our disagreement here.</p>
<p>Our disagreement is that he’s failing to model that <em>his opponents here are all pure conflict theorists.</em></p>
<p>Because, <em>come on. </em>Read their quotes. Consider their arguments.</p>
<p>Remember Scott’s test from Conflict vs. Mistake (<a href=""https://jacobitemag.com/2017/12/22/under-theorizing-governance/"">the Jacobite piece in question</a> is about how communists ignore problems of public choice):</p>
<blockquote><p>What would the conflict theorist argument against the Jacobite piece look like? Take a second to actually think about this. Is it similar to what I’m writing right now – an explanation of conflict vs. mistake theory, and a defense of how conflict theory actually describes the world better than mistake theory does?</p>
<p>No. It’s the Baffler’s article saying that <a href=""https://thebaffler.com/salvos/master-class-on-the-make-hartman"">public choice theory is racist, and if you believe it you’re a white supremacist</a>. If this wasn’t your guess, you still don’t understand that <i>conflict theorists aren’t mistake theorists who just have a different theory about what the mistake is</i>. They’re not going to respond to your criticism by politely explaining why you’re incorrect.</p></blockquote>
<p>I read Scott’s recent post as having <em>exactly </em>this confusion. There is no disagreement about what the mistake is. There are people who are opposed to billionaires, or who support higher taxes. There are people opposed to nerds or to thinking. There are people opposed to all private actions not under ‘democratic control’.  There are people who are <em>opposed to action of any kind. </em></p>
<p>There are also people who enjoy mocking people, and in context don’t care about much else. All they know is that as long as they ‘punch up’ they get a free pass to mock to their heart’s content.</p>
<p>Then there are those who realize there is scapegoating of people that the in-group dislikes, that this is the politically wise side to be on, and so they get on the scapegoat train for self-advancement and/or self-protection.</p>
<p>Scott on the other hand thinks it would be a mistake to even <em>mention</em> or <em>consider </em>such concepts as motivations, for which he cites his post <a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/07/17/caution-on-bias-arguments/"">Caution on Bias Arguments</a>.</p>
<p>Caution is one thing. Sticking one’s head in the sand and ignoring most of what is going on is another.</p>
<p>One can be a mistake theorist, in the sense that one thinks that the best way to improve the world is to figure out and debate what is going on, and what actions, rules or virtues would cause what results, then implement the best solutions.</p>
<p>One cannot be an <em>effective </em>mistake theorist, without acknowledging that there are a lot of conflict theorists out there. The models that don’t include this fact get reality very wrong. If you use one of those models, <em>your model doesn’t work. You get your causes and effects wrong. Your solutions therefore won’t work.</em></p>
<p>There already were <em>approximately </em>zero mistake theorists against billionaire philanthropy in general, even if many of them oppose particular implementations.</p>
<p>Thus, I expect the main response to Scott’s post to mainly be that people read it or hear about it or see a link to it, and notice that <em>there are billionaires out there to criticize. </em>That this is what we are doing next. That there is a developing consensus that it is politically wise and socially cool to be against billionaire philanthropy as a way of being against billionaires. They see an opportunity, and a new trend they must keep up with.</p>
<p>I expect a few people to notice the arguments and update in favor of billionaire philanthropy being better than they realized, but those people to be few, and that them tacking on an extra zero in the positive impact estimation column does not change their behavior much.</p>
<p>There were some anti-government arguments in the post, in the hopes that people will update their general world models and then propagate that update onto billionaire philanthropy. They may convince a few people to shift political positions, but less than if those arguments were presented in another context, because the context here is in support of billionaires. Those who do will probably still mostly fail to propagate the changes to the post’s central points.</p>
<p>Thus, I expect the post to backfire.</p>",Zvi,zvi,Zvi,

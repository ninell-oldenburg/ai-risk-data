Be vigilant that your rules do not grow too complex; make sure you are not relaxing the legitimacy criteria of your exceptions. Periodically audit your rules, inspecting them for complexity; try to formulate simpler versions of complex rules.</em></blockquote><p>This is a very plausible principle. I have had similar thoughts myself. The idea seems to have merit in practice. But is there any theoretical analogue?</p><p>Minimum description length (Occam&apos;s Razor) is an epistemic principle. In Bayesian terms, probabilities must sum to one, which translates information-theoretically (via optimal encodings) to the idea that there are only so many short codes, so we have to assign them carefully to the most probable things.</p><p>However, expected utility is not a limited resource in this way. Updating to think an option is better than previously thought <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/XYCEB9roxEBfgjfxs/the-scales-of-justice-the-notebook-of-rationality"">doesn&apos;t necessarily make other options worse</a>.  Selecting policies is not so different from selecting raw actions. And for Bayesian decision theory, it doesn&apos;t really matter whether a policy is specified as a big table of observation/action pairs, vs an elegantly specified rule. </p><p>Optimality cares not for elegance!</p><p>Yet, even in the relatively formal world of machine learning, the practice seems contrary to this. When you are optimizing a neural network, you don&apos;t actually care that much whether it&apos;s something like a hypothesis (making predictions) or something like a policy (carrying out actions). You apply the same kind of regularization either way, as far as I understand (regularization being the machine-learner&apos;s generalization of Occam). <strong>(Correction: <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/qqG2PdZ7pEcM6ev3S/instrumental-occam#gAtCmdrYeFwTtpk2w"">this seems not to be the case</a>.)</strong></p><p>We <em>might</em> say that this is because (in some sense) the instrumental uncertainty and the epistemic uncertainty are actually being wrapped up together. But (1) this reply seems overly quick to me at present, and I&apos;d want to understand in detail whether this can be justified; (2) I&apos;m curious if there is a <em>purely instrumental</em> version of Occam to be articulated; it seems intuitively really plausible to me, though technically quite mysterious.</p><p>So: is it possible to formulate an instrumental version of Occam? Can we justify a simplicity bias in our policies?</p>",abramdemski,abramdemski,abramdemski,

<h1>Summary</h1>
<ul>
<li>Effective Altruism claims that there is a large funding gap for cheap well-understood developing-world interventions.</li>
<li>Even the most aggressive plausible construal of this claim implies an annual funding gap that could be covered completely by existing major institutional donors.</li>
<li>If this is true, it implies opportunities for comparatively cheap experiments (relative to the endowments of major donors in the space) with extremely high information value.</li>
<li>Such experiments have not happened either because they are impossible, or because the relevant institutional donors think they have better things to do with their money.</li>
<li>Neither scenario suggests that small donors should try to fill this funding gap. If they trust big donors, they should just give to the big donors. If they don't, why should they believe a story clearly meant to extract money from them?</li>

NerqNs3nfAkcJauWE,Create a Full Alternative Stack,create-a-full-alternative-stack,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NerqNs3nfAkcJauWE/create-a-full-alternative-stack,2020-01-31T17:10:00.543Z,84,33,14,False,False,,"<p><a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2020/01/28/potential-ways-to-fight-mazes/"">Last time</a> I proposed nine strategies for fighting mazes. All of them were either systemic solutions requiring coordinated and/or political action, or cultural shifts that happen one person at a time.</p>
<p>Now for the tenth and final proposal for how to fight mazes. The tenth is a proposed strategy that one dedicated person with sufficient resources could implement on their own.</p>
<p>If you are in a position where you have the resources to implement this, please make an effort to take this proposal seriously. And please contact me if you are potentially interested and wish to discuss it further.</p>
<p><b>Solution 10: Create a Full Alternative Stack</b></p>
<p>In some ways this is the most ambitious solution here. It may seem Utopian. </p>
<p>In other ways, it is the least ambitious, and most practical. It could be implemented by a single sufficiently wealthy and committed individual or organization. All other known solutions can be implemented locally, and would help locally, but need general adaptation to succeed in general.</p>
<p>The full alternative stack offers a contract. </p>
<p>Disengage entirely with mazes and traditional distortionary incentives, competitions and signals of all kinds, and discard all zero-sum activity, in favor of<a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/08/26/play-in-hard-mode/""> <i>doing the thing</i></a><i>. </i>Whatever the thing in question may be. Make no compromises to make oneself legible or attractive to outside sources of funding. Tolerate no maze behaviors of any kind. Hire and fire with this deeply in mind.</p>
<p>In exchange, if you keep your end of the bargain, the stack will <i>fully </i>fund you and your operations, at fair prices that do not take advantage of the hold-up opportunity presented by your giving up of other opportunities. Evaluation will be fully on the object-level merits, and the generative processes involved. </p>
<p></p>
<p>This is a form of tenure for the people. If they continue to act with integrity and work to accomplish positive-sum things relevant to the stack’s interests, and spend responsibly, they and their family will have strong financial security. </p>
<p>Think of this as similar to tenure at a university, or to the system of universal employment for partisan hacks. If you are promising the stack gives you the opportunity to prove yourself. Once you have proven yourself, we take care of you, even if you don’t bear as much fruit as we would like, <i>provided you continue to play by the rules of the stack and honor its values</i>. Unlike many tenured professors nowadays, we would not then force you to seek grants, outside investments, or other outside funding for your work. On the contrary, you would be agreeing <i>not </i>to seek outside funding, so as to protect your incentives from corruption.</p>
<p>This is also a form of secured financing for corporations and other organizations. While they need funding to reach maturity, they will be evaluated on whether they are succeeding at doing the thing. Traditional signals, <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2015/05/15/in-a-world-of-venture-capital/"">and anticipation of future traditional signals</a>, will be not only disregarded but punished – it’s fine to look good naturally, but if you are doing things <i>in order to look good or successful to outsiders rather than be good or successful, </i>then that breaks the compact. </p>
<p>We call this a full alternative stack because the ideal version is<i> literally a full alternative stack. </i>It recreates civilization. Those involved would not need or depend on outside goods or services. There would be a local area fully owned by and given over to the project.</p>
<p>That is the full version. The full version is ambitious and difficult, but likely far less ambitious and difficult, and far less expensive, than it appears. We would soon find out how much of current activity is rent extraction or otherwise unproductive, and how much is necessary to keep things running. </p>
<p>A lesser version, built around a particular cause or goal, or to give this freedom to select individuals and corporations, would still be extremely valuable. </p>
<p>The MacArthur grant is a template for what this looks like on a personal level, with a shift in focus from <i>creativity </i>to <i>integrity, </i>and a bump in compensation – $625,000 is a lot of money, but that money is designed to be seed money for an activity rather than financial security. Those getting a MacArthur grant still face the specter of future financial needs. One needs an order of magnitude more than that over a lifetime to be secure while not compromising one’s interactions with society. </p>
<p>For startup corporations, this can be similar to the standard method of funding a biotechnology company to pursue a new drug of unknown efficacy. Milestones are set. If they are met, funding is unlocked at pre-negotiated levels, locked in for both sides in advance. There is no reason to worry about signaling in other ways unless the company is about to fail. We would add the condition of not then selling out to a maze (in the biotech example, a big pharma company, or taking the company public) when successful, instead keeping the operation privately owned by its founders to prevent it from being eaten and transformed or killed. Public markets exert strong pressure towards maze behaviors, so such companies would need to commit to staying away from them.</p>
<p>I believe there is a strong opportunity for a venture capital fund that promises committed, full funding to projects in this way in fields outside biotechnology. Projects that are freed from having to gain strong negotiating positions regarding raising capital could be much better at pursuing actual success and production. To succeed, such a fund would need to honor its commitments carefully and be credible at every stage. This includes its commitments not to respond <i>positively </i>to things that would on the outside be viewed as good news, if they are not in fact relevantly good news. Its word would be its bond. It would also need to be highly skilled at choosing superior evaluation techniques. There are many terrible things about current systems of venture funding, but naive replacement models threaten to be easily gameable or otherwise create new and perhaps much worse versions of the same problems. </p>
<p>Most people nowadays are forced, both within an enterprise and overall in their lives, to structure and censure everything they do in light of their potential future need to look legible, comfortable and successful or valuable to mazes. The prospect of having this option cut off fills them with terror, whether or not this should not be the case. Even when they do not fear it, those around them who rely on them fear it, which has a similar effect.</p>
<p>I am <i>unusually immune </i>to these pressures. I have skills that can earn money on demand, without getting a formal job or the approval of a maze, if I need that. I also have robust savings and a family and community that would save me if I fell upon hard times. <i>This terror is still one of the things I have often struggled with.</i></p>
<p>Freeing a select group to do things without regard to such concerns, and people knowing they have the option to join this group, would be a major cultural change. Ideally this would then become the ‘city on a hill’ that shows what is possible, and gets emulated elsewhere. Regulatory and other legal issues would still have to be navigated, which would often be most of the difficulty of any worthwhile operation. This is why typical versions of this type of proposal go to places like seasteading. Mazes will instinctively attempt to crush whatever is being built.</p>
<p>If one is sitting on a large pile of money and wishes to do good, or simply wishes to increase production, deploying that money effectively has proven a very hard problem. This is to be expected, under even the best/worst conditions, as such problems are anti-inductive. Any easy answers get utilized until they stop being easy answers. Once others find out your criteria for spending or granting money, some of them will Goodhart and/or commit fraud to extract those funds. </p>
<p>The closer you attempt to stick to specified metrics and use criteria you can explain and justify that looks consistent, the more you are optimizing over time for those who Goodhart and commit fraud, in order to grant the appearance of having the appearance of attempting to help in the approved ways, rather than optimizing for actually helping. This is certainly a danger to the full stack operation as well, and the best reason to keep the operation relatively small. </p>
<p>The closer you do <i>not </i>stick to such methods, the more illegible you become, the more blameworthy you appear, and the more likely you are actually buying things that make you feel good about them as your metric. Which, in turn, is even easier to Goodhart or commit fraud on. </p>
<p>Sticking to ‘do the right thing,’ as this solution suggests, and rewarding those who do right things is a rather crazy ask without rich contextual knowledge. The larger you scale, the more universal you attempt to get, the crazier it gets. Goodharting or committing fraud on ‘right thingness’ is as much a threat as Goodharting or committing fraud on anything else, if you’re not staying a step ahead. That very freedom from mazes, Goodharting and fraud is the precious thing you’re trying to get in the first place. </p>
<p>The project has to cash itself out purely on its own terms. It has to care more about doing things its own way than getting things done or looking effective, where that own way is a ruthless focus on what will actually work. Everyone’s instinct, even that of the best possible additions, will be to abandon this at every step. Everyone will face constant pressure to do so. </p>
<p>But without sufficient scale to complete the stack, how do you break free from, and securely break the right people away from the need to worry about, mazes and other outside forces?</p>
<p>Threading that needle is going to be very difficult, even if the other impossible problems are solved. I do not think any one person or formal group can be the head of the entire stack without it getting too large. One must form a distinct subset, and hope others form the required other parts, and until that happens purchase what one needs from the outside using capital, and trust those in the project to continue interacting economically in some ways outside of the stack. </p>
<p>Ideally one does not need to literally go to Mars to be allowed to complete the project. However, <i>if one</i> <i>does need to literally go to Mars, </i>then there is a fair argument that <i>literally going to Mars</i> is a reasonable price to pay to be allowed to complete the project.</p>
<p>The next post asks what we should do when we have a project that would benefit from a large organization.</p>",Zvi,zvi,Zvi,

Consider especially this version of the story, prepared in the 1970s to provide morale and context to reading teachers (John Guthrie, 1977). Essentially, Luria discovered that the illiterate, unschooled peasants were highly resistant to syllogisms and word games. The adult peasants would only answer questions based on their own knowledge, and stubbornly refused to make deductions from given premises. &#x201C;All bears are white where it is snowy. It is snowy in Nova Zembla. What color are the bears in Nova Zembla?&#x201D; &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know, I have never been to Nova Zembla.&#x201D; Children with only a year or two of education, however, were easily able to engage in such abstract reasoning. They quickly answered the syllogisms and drew inferences from hypothetical facts outside of their own observation.<br><br>In this story, I argue, Luria&#x2019;s peasants are indexical geniuses, who refuse to engage in unproven syllogistic games. They are not interested in a global, universal game. Their children, however, are easily introduced to this game by the process of schooling and literacy.<br><br>Interestingly, a more recent group of researchers claim that illiterate people do fine at making inferences against experience, if the context is given as a distant planet (Dias et al., 2005). I am not offering this as true, but as a story about how expecting people to operate in the &#x201C;global knowledge game&#x201D; might portray them as stupider than they really are, if they simply choose not to play in that game. This is to segue into the next hermeneutic pass, in which we are told that the hype surrounding &#x201C;cognitive bias&#x201D; is really a sort of science magic trick, an illusion designed to portray indexical geniuses, like Luria&#x2019;s peasants and ourselves, as global fools.<br><br>The paper is &#x201C;The Bias Bias in Behavioral Economics,&#x201D; by Gerd Gigerenzer (2018). If you, like me, have ever been fascinated by cognitive bias research, this is a brutal paper to come to terms with. Gigerenzer examines several purported biases in what I would call analytic reasoning or the global knowledge game, and finds explanations for these purported biases in the indexical reality of humans.<br><br>For instance, some apparent &#x201C;biases&#x201D; that people display about probability are not actually errors. For the small (and in most cases, merely finite) samples that reality has to offer, people&#x2019;s &#x201C;biased&#x201D; intuitions are more accurate than a &#x201C;globally correct&#x201D; answer would be (that is, the correct answer if the sample were infinite). In tossing fair coins, people tend to intuit that irregular strings are more probable than more regular strings (e.g. that HHHT is more probable than HHHH in a sequence of coin flips). This simple intuition can&#x2019;t be correct, though, because given infinite coin flips, each string is as likely as any other, and if the sequence is only four flips, after HHH, each outcome is equally likely. But for small, finite numbers of flips greater than the string length, Gigerenzer argues, it is the human intuition that is correct, not the naive global solution: HHHT does take less time to show up than HHHH in repeated simulations, and is more commonly encountered in small samples. To drive home his point, he offers a bet:<br><br>    If you are still not convinced, try this bet (Hahn and Warren, 2010), which I will call the law-of-small-numbers bet:<br><br>    You flip a fair coin 20 times. If this sequence contains at least one HHHH, I pay you $100. If it contains at least one HHHT, you pay me $100. If it contains neither, nobody wins.<br><br>More broadly, cognitive bias proponents find fault with their subjects for treating &#x201C;logically equivalent&#x201D; language statements as having different meanings, when context reveals that these &#x201C;logically irrelevant&#x201D; cues frequently do reveal rich meaning in practice. For instance, people react differently to the &#x201C;same&#x201D; information presented negatively vs. positively (10% likelihood of death vs. 90% likelihood of survival). Cognitive bias proponents frame this as an error, but Gigerenzer argues that when people make this &#x201C;error,&#x201D; they are making use of meaningful context that a &#x201C;bias-free&#x201D; robot would miss.</p>",romeostevensit,romeostevensit,romeostevensit,

My usual sleep window now is between 11 pm to 7 am; back then it was more around 1 am to 9; the time I had to wake up to get to school was 5. It was a necessary evil at the time.</p><p>One cup in the morning became two, and then four; when I got home, I realized I was suddenly feeling groggy, so I started drinking 1 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 4 once I got back as well. This unsurprisingly made my actual lack of sleep all the worse.</p><p>I think in the back of my mind, I understood intellectually that this was a Very Bad Idea. Even compared to the average person, I function <em>really</em> poorly when I&apos;m tired relative to when I&apos;m awake. But I also have an extremist bent to my personality; I felt throughout high school and much of college that if I were going to quit coffee, I wanted to do it cold turkey. I would be strong and bear the pain.</p><p>The big problem with this is that I Pavloved myself into loving the taste of coffee too much to ever have success with this after high school. (Thank Christ 12 year old me understood this was a possibility, and reflexively refused to drink anything but black coffee -- otherwise I would be several pounds heavier.)</p><p>There are downsides to drinking coffee of any variety, decaf or not. It gradually stains your teeth. Last year I paid a few hundred dollars to get my teeth whitened because frankly I found them yellowed enough to be off-putting when I looked at myself in the mirror, especially with a pale sunscreen tint on the surrounding skin creating a contrast.</p><p>But let&apos;s be honest with ourselves: Slightly stained teeth are much, much less annoying than eternal nights spent in half-sleep.</p><p>About 6 weeks ago, undergraduate winter break began here at Northwestern. I didn&apos;t have much to do, so I figured this would be a good time to wean myself off of coffee. I understood I had tried to do this before, so I decided to do the opposite thing: Make the <em>minimum possible change that results in the maximum return. </em>Hence the post title; ELDR stands for <strong>Everyday Life Diminishing Returns</strong>.</p><p>I knew from prior experience that I don&apos;t suffer strong withdrawal symptoms when I go without it; I just missed the taste and comfort of a warm cup of coffee. So I took $50 I had from my small pool of savings, went and bought a half-dozen jars of decaf instant coffee, sticking with the same brand to ensure the taste was as similar to the &quot;real thing&quot; as I could muster. I still had a few jars left of the non-decaf stuff, but I just put them away in a shelf, while I left 2 inviting jars of decaf right next to the kettle. And I promised myself that I&apos;d stick to decaf for the rest of winter break, and see if I felt any different.</p><p>I felt <em>very</em> different.</p><p>I began to wake up much more refreshed from sleep. My anxiety and racing thoughts, which I had worried were so deeply ingrained as to have reached the <a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejsp.674"">asymptote of automaticity</a>, quelled down to a murmur even less than what I was used to in an average 10 minute meditation sit. (My <em>actual</em> meditation sits I stopped doing, because I didn&apos;t need the extra help feeling less anxious!) My interactions with other people became much more relaxed and freeform. I even took that I could work for longer periods of time without getting distracted, or scared that I would be unable to crack the problem I was trying to solve. My cognitive tactic of reminding myself,</p><blockquote>Bayesian inference suggests you will be able to solve this textbook problem, as it was literally designed to be solved, and you have literally never ran across a textbook problem you could not eventually solve with the proper amount of time and study.</blockquote><p>became much more reflexive, and even more deeply <em>felt</em>, because I genuinely believed that <em>future, non-caffeinated me would actually put in the work needed without panicking or giving up, because I had seen evidence with my own eyes of him doing just that. </em>(I wonder if you can success spiral on top of a placebo? Probably. But caffeine is pretty well understood to fuck with your neurons, so I don&apos;t actually think this is the case.)</p><p>And I didn&apos;t have to give up coffee. The decaf stuff tastes almost exactly the same. It still scratches that itch of wanting to get to work, and setting on the kettle as a <a href=""https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2018/12/13/scrupulosity-sequence-3-load-bearing-things/"">load-bearing activity</a> to signal to myself &quot;Time to start firing on all cylinders&quot;.</p><p>---</p><p>Diminishing returns is something that, for whatever reason, my body and mind recoils at.</p><p>There is a part of me that feels like a failure because while we made a very positive change through a very easy action, we &quot;should&quot; have taken the &quot;true route&quot; and kicked the habit altogether.</p><p>This is the same part of me that thinks 10 minutes of studying is worthless if we don&apos;t have 2 hours to dump into the problem, or that we should wait until we are <em>really</em> well-rested to bother doing something productive.</p><p>If I were to take a guess, I would actually say that people who read LessWrong are less likely than the average person to have such issues with a similar kind of <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7GjmfXBcgzxn33FoZ/extraordinary-ethics-require-extraordinary-arguments"">demon</a>. Diminishing returns is an <em>amazing</em> breath of fresh air to someone who embodies the &quot;Brilliant, but Lazy&quot; character trope. &quot;Finally, I have a good, important-sounding way to tell my coworkers to chill out about something that doesn&apos;t matter anyway.&quot;</p><p>If my experience, however, sounds like yours: <strong>Fight it. </strong>Wrap your natural tendency towards being hardcore about things you want to do, and instead go hardcore <em>about not going hardcore</em>. </p><p>Become an acolyte of the Temple of Diminishing Returns, and sing its praises in your heart.

<p>Naming things is a bit of a unilateralist action. While community members don't have to accept a specific naming proposal, they are likely to do so if they like the concept. I can't think of many cases where Eliezer or someone named a concept, and the community decided that that name was poor, and renamed it.</p>
<p>However, I can't find much theory on how to figure out great names for things, or even what to consider when doing so. I would have expected there to be comprehensive discussion around Information Architecture, UX Design, or the Library Sciences on this topic, but couldn't identify much outside of card sorting and a few lists of rough heuristics.</p>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke%27s_three_laws"">Clarke’s First Law</a> goes: When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.</p>
<p>Stuart Russell is only 58. But what he lacks in age, he makes up in distinction: he’s a computer science professor at Berkeley, neurosurgery professor at UCSF, DARPA advisor, and author of the leading textbook on AI. His new book <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Human-Compatible-Artificial-Intelligence-Problem/dp/0525558616/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=human+compatible&amp;qid=1577149898&amp;sr=8-1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=slatestarcode-20&amp;linkId=ea5e41f92ad5c6166f0b399c2b430671&amp;language=en_US""><i>Human Compatible</i></a> states that superintelligent AI is possible; Clarke would recommend we listen.</p>
<p>I’m only half-joking: in addition to its contents, <i>Human Compatible</i> is important as an <i>artifact</i>, a crystallized proof that top scientists now think AI safety is worth writing books about. Nick Bostrom’s <i>Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies</i> previously filled this role. But <i>Superintelligence</i> was in 2014, and by a philosophy professor. From the artifactual point of view, HC is just better – more recent, and by a more domain-relevant expert. </p>
<p>But if you also open up the books to see what’s inside (not recommended; that’s where the confusing stuff is), the two defy easy comparison. </p>
<p>S:PDS was unabashedly a weird book. It explored various outrageous scenarios (what if the AI destroyed humanity to prevent us from turning it off? what if it put us all in cryostasis so it didn’t count as destroying us? what if it converted the entire Earth into computronium?) with no excuse beyond that, outrageous or not, they might come true. Bostrom was going out on a very shaky limb to broadcast a crazy-sounding warning about what might be the most important problem humanity has ever faced, and the book made this absolutely clear.</p>
<p>HC somehow makes risk from superintelligence <i>not sound weird</i>. I can imagine my mother reading this book, nodding along, feeling better educated at the end of it, agreeing with most of what it says (it’s by a famous professor! I’m sure he knows his stuff!) and never having a moment where she sits bolt upright and goes <i>what?</i> It’s just a bizarrely normal, respectable book. It’s not that it’s dry and technical – HC is much more accessible than S:PDS, with funny anecdotes from Russell’s life, cute vignettes about hypothetical robots, and the occasional dad joke. It’s not hiding any of the weird superintelligence parts. Rereading it carefully, they’re all in there – when I leaf through it for examples, I come across a quote from Moravec about how “the immensities of cyberspace will be teeming with unhuman superminds, engaged in affairs that are to human concerns as ours are to those of bacteria”. But somehow it all sounds normal. If aliens landed on the White House lawn tomorrow, I believe Stuart Russell could report on it in a way that had people agreeing it was an interesting story, then turning to the sports page. As such, it fulfills its artifact role with flying colors.</p>
<p>How does it manage this? Although it mentions the weird scenarios, it doesn’t dwell on them. Instead, it focuses on the present and the plausible near-future, uses those to build up concepts like “AI is important” and “poorly aligned AI could be dangerous”. Then it addresses those abstractly, sallying into the far future only when absolutely necessary. Russell goes over all the recent debates in AI – Facebook, algorithmic bias, self-driving cars. Then he shows how these are caused by systems doing what we tell them to do (ie optimizing for one easily-described quantity) rather than what we really want them to do (capture the full range of human values). Then he talks about how future superintelligent systems will have the same problem.</p>
<p>His usual go-to for a superintelligent system is Robbie the Robot, a sort of Jetsons-esque butler for his master Harriet the Human. The two of them have all sorts of interesting adventures together where Harriet asks Robbie for something and Robbie uses better or worse algorithms to interpret her request. Usually these requests are things like shopping for food or booking appointments. It all feels very Jetsons-esque. There’s no mention of the word “singleton” in the book’s index (not that I’m complaining – in the missing spot between <i>simulated evolution of programs, 171</i> and <i>slaughterbot, 111</i>, you instead find <i>Slate Star Codex blog, 146, 169-70</i>). But even from this limited framework, he manages to explore some of the same extreme questions Bostrom does, and present some of the answers he’s spent the last few years coming up with.</p>
<p>If you’ve been paying attention, much of the book will be retreading old material. There’s a history of AI, an attempt to define intelligence, an exploration of morality from the perspective of someone trying to make AIs have it, some introductions to the idea of superintelligence and “intelligence explosions”. But I want to focus on three chapters: the debate on AI risk, the explanation of Russell’s own research program, and the section on misuse of existing AI.</p>
<p><b>II.</b></p>
<p>Chapter 6, “The Not-So-Great Debate”, is the highlight of the book-as-artifact. Russell gets on his <i>cathedra</i> as top AI scientist, surveys the world of other top AI scientists saying AI safety isn’t worth worrying about yet, and pronounces them super wrong:</p>
<blockquote><p>I don’t mean to suggest that there cannot be any reasonable objections to the view that poorly designed superintelligent machines would present a serious risk to humanity. It’s just that I have yet to see such an objection.</p></blockquote>
<p>He doesn’t pull punches here, collecting a group of what he considers the stupidest arguments into a section called “Instantly Regrettable Remarks”, with the connotation that the their authors (“all of whom are well-known AI researchers”), should have been embarrassed to have been seen with such bad points. Others get their own sections, slightly less aggressively titled, but it doesn’t seem like he’s exactly oozing respect for those either. For example:</p>
<blockquote><p>Kevin Kelly, founding editor of Wired magazine and a remarkably perceptive technology commentator, takes this argument one step further. In “The Myth of a Superhuman AI,” he writes, “Intelligence is not a single dimension, so ‘smarter than humans’ is a meaningless concept.” In a single stroke, all concerns about superintelligence are wiped away.</p>
<p>Now, one obvious response is that a machine could exceed human capabilities in all relevant dimensions of intelligence. In that case, even by Kelly’s strict standards, the machine would be smarter than a human. But this rather strong assumption is not necessary to refute Kelly’s argument.</p>
<p>Consider the chimpanzee. Chimpanzees probably have better short-term memory than humans, even on human-oriented tasks such as recalling sequences of digits. Short-term memory is an important dimension of intelligence. By Kelly’s argument, then, humans are not smarter than chimpanzees; indeed, he would claim that “smarter than a chimpanzee” is a meaningless concept.</p>
<p>This is cold comfort to the chimpanzees and other species that survive only because we deign to allow it, and to all those species that we have already wiped out. It’s also cold comfort to humans who might be worried about being wiped out by machines.</p></blockquote>
<p>Or:</p>
<blockquote><p>The risks of superintelligence can also be dismissed by arguing that superintelligence cannot be achieved. These claims are not new, but it is surprising now to see AI researchers themselves claiming that such AI is impossible. For example, a major report from the AI100 organization, <a href=""https://ai100.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj9861/f/ai_100_report_0831fnl.pdf"">Artificial Intelligence and Life in 2030</a>, includes the following claim: “Unlike in the movies, there is no race of superhuman robots on the horizon or probably even possible.”</p>
<p>To my knowledge, this is the first time that serious AI researchers have publicly espoused the view that human-level or superhuman AI is impossible—and this in the middle of a period of extremely rapid progress in AI research, when barrier after barrier is being breached. It’s as if a group of leading cancer biologists announced that they had been fooling us all along: They’ve always known that there will never be a cure for cancer.</p>
<p>What could have motivated such a volte-face? The report provides no arguments or evidence whatever. (Indeed, what evidence could there be that no physically possible arrangement of atoms outperforms the human brain?) I suspect that the main reason is tribalism — the instinct to circle the wagons against what are perceived to be “attacks” on AI. It seems odd, however, to perceive the claim that superintelligent AI is possible as an attack on AI, and even odder to defend AI by saying that AI will never succeed in its goals. We cannot insure against future catastrophe simply by betting against human ingenuity.</p>
<p>If superhuman AI is not strictly impossible, perhaps it’s too far off to worry about? This is the gist of Andrew Ng’s assertion that it’s like worrying about “overpopulation on the planet Mars.” Unfortunately, a long-term risk can still be cause for immediate concern. The right time to worry about a potentially serious problem for humanity depends not just on when the problem will occur but also on how long it will take to prepare and implement a solution. For example, if we were to detect a large asteroid on course to collide with Earth in 2069, would we wait until 2068 to start working on a solution? Far from it! There would be a worldwide emergency project to develop the means to counter the threat, because we can’t say in advance how much time is needed.</p></blockquote>
<p>Russell displays master-level competence at the <a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/04/13/proving-too-much/"">proving too much</a> technique, neatly dispatching sophisticated arguments with a well-placed metaphor. Some expert claims it’s meaningless to say one thing is smarter than another thing, and Russell notes that for all practical purposes it’s meaningful to say humans are smarter than chimps. Some other expert says nobody can control research anyway, and Russell brings up various obvious examples of people controlling research, like the ethical agreements already in place on the use of gene editing.</p>
<p>I’m a big fan of Luke Muehlhauser’s definition of common sense – making sure your thoughts about hard problems make use of the good intuitions you have built for thinking about easy problems. His example was people who would correctly say “I see no evidence for the Loch Ness monster, so I don’t believe it” but then screw up and say “You can’t disprove the existence of God, so you have to believe in Him”. Just use the same kind of logic for the God question you use for every other question, and you’ll be fine! Russell does great work applying common sense to the AI debate, reminding us that if we stop trying to out-sophist ourselves into coming up with incredibly clever reasons why this thing cannot possibly happen, we will be left with the common-sense proposition that it might.</p>
<p>My only complaint about this section of the book – the one thing that would have added a cherry to the slightly troll-ish cake – is that it missed a chance to include a reference to <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10987"">On The Impossibility Of Supersized Machines</a>.</p>
<p>Is Russell (or am I) going too far here? I don’t think so. Russell is arguing for a much weaker proposition than the ones Bostrom focuses on. He’s not assuming super-fast takeoffs, or nanobot swarms, or anything like that. All he’s trying to do is argue that if technology keeps advancing, then at <i>some</i> point AIs will become smarter than humans and maybe we should worry about this. You’ve really got to bend over backwards to find counterarguments to this, those counterarguments tend to sound like “but maybe there’s no such thing as intelligence so this claim is meaningless”, and I think Russell treats these with the contempt they deserve.</p>
<p>He is more understanding of – but equally good at dispatching – arguments for why the problem will really be easy. Can’t We Just Switch It Off? No; if an AI is truly malicious, it will try to hide its malice and prevent you from disabling it. Can’t We Just Put It In A Box? No, if it were smart enough it could probably find ways to affect the world anyway (this answer was good as far as it goes, but I think Russell’s threat model also allows a better one: he imagines thousands of AIs being used by pretty much everybody to do everything, from self-driving cars to curating social media, and keeping them all in boxes is no more plausible than keeping transportation or electricity in a box). Can’t We Just Merge With The Machines? Sounds hard. Russell does a good job with this section as well, and I think a hefty dose of common sense helps here too.</p>
<p>He concludes with a <a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/05/22/ai-researchers-on-ai-risk/"">quote</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The “skeptic” position seems to be that, although we should probably get a couple of bright people to start working on preliminary aspects of the problem, we shouldn’t panic or start trying to ban AI research. The “believers”, meanwhile, insist that although we shouldn’t panic or start trying to ban AI research, we should probably get a couple of bright people to start working on preliminary aspects of the problem.</p></blockquote>
<p>I couldn’t have put it better myself.</p>
<p><b>III.</b></p>
<p>If it’s important to control AI, and easy solutions like “put it in a box” aren’t going to work, what do you do?</p>
<p>Chapters 7 and 8, “AI: A Different Approach” and “Provably Beneficial AI” will be the most exciting for people who read Bostrom but haven’t been paying attention since. Bostrom ends by saying we need people to start working on the control problem, and explaining why this will be very hard. Russell is reporting all of the good work his lab at UC Berkeley has been doing on the control problem in the interim – and arguing that their approach, Cooperative Inverse Reinforcement Learning, succeeds at doing some of the very hard things. If you haven’t spent long nights fretting over whether this problem was possible, it’s hard to convey how encouraging and inspiring it is to see people gradually chip away at it. Just believe me when I say you may want to be really grateful for the existence of Stuart Russell and people like him.</p>
<p>Previous stabs at this problem foundered on inevitable problems of interpretation, scope, or altered preferences. In Yudkowsky and Bostrom’s classic “paperclip maximizer” scenario, a human orders an AI to make paperclips. If the AI becomes powerful enough, it does whatever is necessary to make as many paperclips as possible – bulldozing virgin forests to create new paperclip mines, maliciously misinterpreting “paperclip” to mean uselessly tiny paperclips so it can make more of them, even attacking people who try to change its programming or deactivate it (since deactivating it would cause fewer paperclips to exist). You can try adding epicycles in, like “make as many paperclips as possible, unless it kills someone, and also don’t prevent me from turning you off”, but a big chunk of Bostrom’s S:PDS was just example after example of why that wouldn’t work.</p>
<p>Russell argues you can shift the AI’s goal from “follow your master’s commands” to “use your master’s commands as evidence to try to figure out what they actually want, a mysterious true goal which you can only ever estimate with some probability”. Or as he puts it:</p>
<blockquote><p>The problem comes from confusing two distinct things: reward signals and actual rewards. In the standard approach to reinforcement learning, these are one and the same. That seems to be a mistake. Instead, they should be treated separately…reward signals provide information about the accumulation of actual reward, which is the thing to be maximized.</p></blockquote>
<p>So suppose I wanted an AI to make paperclips for me, and I tell it “Make paperclips!” The AI already has some basic contextual knowledge about the world that it can use to figure out what I mean, and my utterance “Make paperclips!” further narrows down its guess about what I want. If it’s not sure – if most of its probability mass is on “convert this metal rod here to paperclips” but a little bit is on “take over the entire world and convert it to paperclips”, it will ask me rather than proceed, worried that if it makes the wrong choice it will actually be moving further <i>away</i> from its goal (satisfying my mysterious mind-state) rather than towards it.</p>
<p>Or: suppose the AI starts trying to convert my dog into paperclips. I shout “No, wait, not like that!” and lunge to turn it off. The AI interprets my desperate attempt to deactivate it as further evidence about its hidden goal – apparently its current course of action is moving away from my preference rather than towards it. It doesn’t know exactly which of its actions is decreasing its utility function or why, but it knows that continuing to act must be decreasing its utility somehow – I’ve given it evidence of that. So it stays still, happy to be turned off, knowing that being turned off is serving its goal (to achieve my goals, whatever they are) better than staying on.</p>
<p>This also solves the wireheading problem. Suppose you have a reinforcement learner whose reward is you saying “Thank you, you successfully completed that task”. A sufficiently weak robot may have no better way of getting reward than actually performing the task for you; a stronger one will threaten you at gunpoint until you say that sentence a million times, which will provide it with much more reward much faster than taking out your trash or whatever. Russell’s shift in priorities ensures that won’t work. You can still reinforce the robot by saying “Thank you” – that will give it evidence that it succeeded at its real goal of fulfilling your mysterious preference – but the words are only a signpost to the deeper reality; making you say “thank you” again and again will no longer count as success.</p>
<p>All of this sounds almost trivial written out like this, but number one, everything is trivial after someone thinks about it, and number two, there turns out to be a lot of controversial math involved in making it work out (all of which I skipped over). There are also some big remaining implementation hurdles. For example, the section above describes a Bayesian process – start with a prior on what the human wants, then update. But how do you generate the prior? How complicated do you want to make things? Russell walks us through an example where a robot gets great information that a human values paperclips at 80 cents – but the real preference was valuing them at 80 cents on weekends and 12 cents on weekdays. If the robot didn’t consider that a possibility, it would never be able to get there by updating. But if it did consider every single possibility, it would never be able to learn anything beyond “this particular human values paperclips at 80 cents on 12:08 AM on January 14th when he’s standing in his bedroom.” Russell says that there is “no working example” of AIs that can solve this kind of problem, but “the general idea is encompassed within current thinking about machine learning”, which sounds half-meaningless and half-reassuring.</p>
<p>People with a more technical bent than I have might want to look into some deeper criticisms of CIRL, including <a href=""https://arbital.com/p/updated_deference/"">Eliezer Yudkowsky’s article here</a> and <a href=""https://mailchi.mp/59ddebcb3b9a/an-69-stuart-russells-new-book-on-why-we-need-to-replace-the-standard-model-of-ai"">some discussion in the AI Alignment Newsletter</a>.</p>
<p><b>IV.</b></p>
<p>I want to end by discussing what was probably supposed to be an irrelevant middle chapter of the book, Misuses of AI.</p>
<p>Russell writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>A compassionate and jubilant use of humanity’s cosmic endowment sounds wonderful, but we also have to reckon with the rapid rate of innovation in the malfeasance sector. Ill-intentioned people are thinking up new ways to misuse AI so quickly that this chapter is likely to be outdated even before it attains printed form. Think of it not as depressing reading, however, but as a call to act before it is too late.</p></blockquote>
<p>…and then we get a tour of all the ways AIs are going wrong today: surveillance, drones, deepfakes, algorithmic bias, job loss to automation, social media algorithms, etc. </p>
<p>Some of these are pretty worrying. But not all of them.</p>
<p>Google “deepfakes” and you will find a host of articles claiming that we are about to lose the very concept of truth itself. Brookings <a href=""https://www.brookings.edu/research/is-seeing-still-believing-the-deepfake-challenge-to-truth-in-politics/"">calls</a> deepfakes “threat to truth in politics” and comes up with a scenario where deepfakes “could trigger a nuclear war.” <i>The Guardian</i> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/nov/12/deep-fakes-fake-news-truth"">asks</a> “You Thought Fake News Was Bad? Deepfakes Are Where Truth Goes To Die”. And these aren’t even the alarmist ones! The Irish Times calls it an “information apocalypse” and literally titles <a href=""https://www.irishtimes.com/business/innovation/be-afraid-the-era-of-easy-deepfake-videos-is-upon-us-1.4081591'&gt;their article&lt;/A&gt; “Be Afraid”; Good Times just writes &lt;A HREF="">Welcome To Deepfake Hell</a>.  Meanwhile, deepfakes have been available for a couple of years now, and nothing bad has happened except a few teenagers using them to produce pornography, ie the expected outcome of every technology ever. Also, it’s hard to see why forging videos should be so much worse than forging images with Photoshop, forging documents through whatever document-forgers do, or forging text through lying. Brookings explains that deepfakes might cause nuclear war because someone might forge a video or audio of the President ordering a nuclear strike and then commanders might believe it. But it’s unclear why this is so much more plausible than someone writing a memo saying “Please launch a nuclear strike, sincerely, the President” and commanders believing <i>that</i>. Other papers have highlighted the danger of creating a fake sex tape with a politician in order to discredit them, but you can already convincingly Photoshop an explicit photo of your least favorite politician, and everyone will just laugh at you.</p>
<p>Algorithmic bias has also been getting colossal unstoppable neverending near-infinite unbelievable amounts of press lately, but the most popular examples <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ouQNu3hhfKLBRuwR7/no-nonsense-version-of-the-racial-algorithm-bias"">basically boil down to</a> “it’s impossible to satisfy several conflicting definitions of ‘unbiased’ simultaneously, and algorithms do not do this impossible thing”. Humans also do not do the impossible thing. Occasionally someone is able to dig up an example which actually seems slightly worrying, but I have never seen anyone prove (or even seriously argue) that algorithms are <i>in general</i> more biased than humans (see also <a href=""https://behavioralscientist.org/principles-for-the-application-of-human-intelligence/"">Principles For The Application Of Human Intelligence</a> – no, seriously, see it).  Overall I am not sure this deserves all the attention it gets any time someone brings up AI, tech, science, matter, energy, space, time, or the universe.</p>
<p>Or: with all the discussion about how social media algorithms are radicalizing the youth, it was refreshing to read <a href=""https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2019/11/do-social-media-drive-the-rise-in-right-wing-populism.html"">a study investigating whether this was actually true</a>, which found that social media use did not increase support for right-wing populism, and online media use (including social media use) seems to actually be negatively correlated (correlational studies are always bad). Recent studies of YouTube’s algorithms find they <a href=""https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2019/12/new-evidence-that-youtube-doesnt-radicalize.html"">do not naturally tend to radicalize</a>, and <a href=""https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2019/10/facts-about-youtube.html"">may deradicalize</a>, viewers, although I’ve heard some people say this is only true of the current algorithm and the old ones (which were not included in these studies) were much worse.</p>
<p>Or: is automation destroying jobs? Although it seems like it <i>should</i>, <a href=""https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=266082064082025030087019101083000000101015002033002030090083121006071084106064029007029026017010047102021127108007020073109006104082030064006066090018125075097076062002033127114089018126094010098092124103082013109081073117003089084071007101004026126&amp;EXT=pdf"">the evidence continues to suggest</a> that it isn’t. There are various theories for why this should be, most of which suggest it may not destroy jobs in the near future either. See <a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/02/19/technological-unemployment-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know/"">my review of technological unemployment</a> for details.</p>
<p>A careful reading reveals Russell appreciates most of these objections. A less careful reading does <i>not</i> reveal this. The general structure is “HERE IS A TERRIFYING WAY THAT AI COULD BE KILLING YOU AND YOUR FAMILY although studies do show that this is probably not literally happening in exactly this way AND YOUR LEADERS ARE POWERLESS TO STOP IT!”</p>
<p>I understand the impulse. This book ends up doing an amazing job of talking about AI safety without sounding weird. And part of how it accomplishes this is building on a foundation of “AI is causing problems now”. The media has already prepared the way; all Russell has to do is vaguely gesture at deepfakes and algorithmic radicalization, and everyone says “Oh yeah, that stuff!” and realizes that they <i>already</i> believe AI is dangerous and needs aligning. And then you can add “and future AI will be the same way but even more”, and you’re home free.</p>
<p>But the whole thing makes me nervous. Lots of right-wingers say “climatologists used to worry about global cooling, why should we believe them now about global warming?” They’re wrong – global cooling was never really a big thing. But in 2040, might the same people say “AI scientists used to worry about deepfakes, why should we believe them now about the Singularity?” And might they actually have a point this time? If we get a reputation as the people who fall for every panic about AI, including the ones that in retrospect turn out to be kind of silly, will we eventually cry wolf one too many times and lose our credibility before crunch time?</p>
<p>I think the actual answer to this question is “Haha, as if our society actually punished people for being wrong”. The next US presidential election is all set to be Socialists vs. Right-Wing Authoritarians – and I’m still saying with a straight face that the public notices when movements were wrong before and lowers their status? Have the people who said there were WMDs in Iraq lost status? The people who said sanctions on Iraq <a href=""https://www.bmj.com/company/newsroom/reported-doubling-in-child-mortality-in-iraq-following-un-sanctions-untrue/"">were killing thousands of children</a>? The people who said Trump was definitely for sure colluding with Russia? The people who said global warming wasn’t real? The people who pushed growth mindset as a panacea for twenty years? </p>
<p>So probably this is a brilliant rhetorical strategy with no downsides. But it still gives me a visceral “ick” reaction to associate with something that might not be accurate.</p>
<p>And there’s a sense in which this is all obviously ridiculous. The people who think superintelligent robots will destroy humanity – these people should worry about associating with the people who believe fake videos might fool people on YouTube, because the latter group is going beyond what the evidence will support? <i>Really?</i> But yes. Really. It’s more likely that catastrophic runaway global warming will destroy the world a hundred years from now than that it will reach 75 degrees in San Francisco tomorrow (predicted high: 56); extreme scenarios about the far future are more defensible than even weak claims about the present that are ruled out by the evidence.</p>
<p>There’s been some discussion in effective altruism recently about public relations. The movement has many convincing hooks (you can save a live for $3000, donating bednets is very effective, think about how you would save a drowning child) and many things its leading intellectuals are actually thinking about (how to stop existential risks, how to make people change careers, how to promote plant-based meat), and the Venn diagram between the hooks and the real topics has <a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/08/16/fear-and-loathing-at-effective-altruism-global-2017/"">only partial overlap</a>. What to do about this? It’s a hard question, and I have no strong opinion besides a deep respect for everyone on both sides of it and appreciation for the work they do trying to balance different considerations in creating a better world.</p>
<p>HC’s relevance to this debate is as an extraordinary example. If you try to optimize for being good at public relations and convincingness, you can be really, really good at public relations and convincingness, even when you’re trying to explain a really difficult idea to a potentially hostile audience. You can do it while still being more accurate, page for page, than a <i>New York Times</i> article on the same topic. There are no obvious disadvantages to doing this. It still makes me nervous.</p>
<p><b>V.</b></p>
<p>My reaction to this book is probably weird. I got interested in AI safety by hanging out with transhumanists and neophiles who like to come up with the most extreme scenario possible, and then back down when maybe it isn’t true. Russell got interested in AI safety by hanging out with sober researchers who like to be as boring and conservative as possible, and then accept new ideas once the evidence for them proves overwhelming. At some point one hopes we meet in the middle. We’re almost there.</p>
<p>But maybe we’re not quite there yet. My reaction to this book has been “what an amazing talent Russell must have to build all of this up from normality”. But maybe it’s not talent. Maybe Russell is just recounting his own intellectual journey. Maybe this is what a straightforward examination of AI risk looks like if you have fewer crazy people in your intellectual pedigree than I do.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well, sure, this theory isn't <em>exactly</em> right. But it's the best theory we have right now. Do you have a better theory? If not, you can't really claim to have refuted the theory, can you?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is <em>wrong</em>. This is falsification-resisting theory-apologism. Karl Popper would be livid.</p>
<p>The relevant reason why it's wrong is that <em>theories make high-precision claims</em>. For example, the standard theory of arithmetic says 561+413=974. Not 975 or 973 or 97.4000001, but <em>exactly</em> 974. If arithmetic didn't have this guarantee, math would look <em>very</em> different from how it currently looks (it would be necessary to account for possible small jumps in arithmetic operations).</p>
<p>A single bit flip in the state of a computer process can crash the whole program. Similarly, high-precision theories rely on precise invariants, and even small violations of these invariants sink the theory's claims.</p>
<p>To a first approximation, a computer either (a) almost always works (&gt;99.99% probability of getting the right answer) or (b) doesn't work (&lt;0.01% probability of getting the right answer). There are edge cases such as randomly crashing computers or computers with <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium_FDIV_bug"">small floating point errors</a>. However, even a computer that crashes every few minutes functions <em>very precisely correctly</em> in &gt;99% of seconds that it runs.</p>
<p>If a computer makes random small errors 0.01% of the time in e.g. arithmetic operations, it's not an almost-working computer, it's a <em>completely non-functioning</em> computer, that will crash almost immediately.</p>
<p>The claim that a given algorithm or circuit really adds two numbers is <em>very precise</em>. Even a single pair of numbers that it adds incorrectly refutes the claim, and very much risks making this algorithm/circuit useless. (The rest of the program would not be able to rely on guarantees, and would instead need to know the domain in which the algorithm/circuit functions; this would significantly complicate the reasoning about correctness)</p>
<p>Importantly, such a refutation does <em>not</em> need to come along with an alternative theory of what the algorithm/circuit does. To refute the claim that it adds numbers, it's sufficient to show a single counterexample without suggesting an alternative. Quality assurance processes are primarily about <em>identifying</em> errors, not about specifying the behavior of non-functioning products.</p>
<p>A Bayesian may argue that the refuter must have an alternative belief about the circuit. While this is true assuming the refuter is Bayesian, such a belief need not be high-precision. It may be a high-entropy distribution. And if the refuter is a human, they are not a Bayesian (that would take too much compute), and will instead have a vague representation of the circuit as ""something doing some unspecified thing"", with some vague intuitions about what sorts of things are more likely than other things. In any case, the Bayesian criticism certainly doesn't require the refuter to replace the claim about the circuit with an alternative high-precision claim; either a low-precision belief or a lack-of-belief will do.</p>
<p>The case of computer algorithms is particularly clear, but of course this applies elsewhere:</p>
<ul>
<li>If there's a single exception to conservation of energy, then a high percentage of modern physics theories completely break. The single exception may be sufficient to, for example, create perpetual motion machines. Physics, then, makes a very high-precision claim that energy is conserved, and a refuter of this claim need not supply an alternative physics.</li>
<li>If a text is claimed to be the word of God and totally literally true, then a single example of a definitely-wrong claim in the text is sufficient to refute the claim. It isn't necessary to supply a better religion; the original text should lose any credit it was assigned for being the word of God.</li>
<li>If rational agent theory is a bad fit for effective human behavior, then the precise predictions of microeconomic theory (e.g. the option of trade <em>never</em> reducing expected utility for either actor, or the efficient market hypothesis being true) are almost certainly false. It isn't necessary to supply an alternative theory of effective human behavior to reject these predictions.</li>
<li>If it is claimed philosophically that agents can only gain knowledge through sense-data, then a single example of an agent gaining knowledge without corresponding sense-data (e.g. mental arithmetic) is sufficient to refute the claim. It isn't necessary to supply an alternative theory of how agents gain knowledge for this to refute the strongly empirical theory.</li>
<li>If it is claimed that hedonic utility is the only valuable thing, then a single example of a valuable thing other than hedonic utility is sufficient to refute the claim. It isn't necessary to supply an alternative theory of value.</li>
</ul>
<p>A theory that has been refuted remains contextually ""useful"" in a sense, but it's the walking dead. It isn't really true everywhere, and:</p>
<ul>
<li>Machines believed to function on the basis of the theory cannot be trusted to be highly reliable</li>
<li>Exceptions to the theory can sometimes be manufactured at will (this is relevant in both security and philosophy)</li>
<li>The theory may make significantly worse predictions on average than a skeptical high-entropy prior or low-precision intuitive guesswork, due to being precisely wrong rather than imprecise</li>
<li>Generative intellectual processes will eventually discard it, preferring instead an alternative high-precision theory or low-precision intuitions or skepticism</li>
<li>The theory will go on doing damage through making false high-precision claims</li>
</ul>
<p>The fact that false high-precision claims are generally more damaging than false low-precision claims is important ethically. High-precision claims are often used to ethically justify coercion, violence, and so on, where low-precision claims would have been insufficient. For example, imprisoning someone for a long time may be ethically justified if they <em>definitely</em> committed a serious crime, but is much less likely to be if the belief that they committed a crime is merely a low-precision guess, not validated by any high-precision checking machine. Likewise for psychiatry, which justifies incredibly high levels of coercion on the basis of precise-looking claims about different kinds of cognitive impairment and their remedies.</p>
<p>Therefore, I believe there is an ethical imperative to apply skepticism to high-precision claims, and to allow them to be falsified by evidence, even without knowing what the real truth is other than that it isn't as the high-precision claim says it is.</p>

Here&apos;s the abstract:</p><blockquote>This paper looks at philosophical questions that arise in the context of AI alignment. It defends three propositions. First, normative and technical aspects of the AI alignment problem are interrelated, creating space for productive engagement between people working in both domains. Second, it is important to be clear about the goal of alignment. There are significant differences between AI that aligns with instructions, intentions, revealed preferences, ideal preferences, interests and values. A principle-based approach to AI alignment, which combines these elements in a systematic way, has considerable advantages in this context. Third, the central challenge for theorists is not to identify &apos;true&apos; moral principles for AI; rather, it is to identify fair principles for alignment, that receive reflective endorsement despite widespread variation in people&apos;s moral beliefs. The final part of the paper explores three ways in which fair principles for AI alignment could potentially be identified.</blockquote><p>As I said, I haven&apos;t read the <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.09768"">whole thing</a>, but I&apos;m somewhat suspicious of moving in the direction of principles as discussed in this paper since, based on my skimming, it seems to be suggesting we pick the method of aggregating human preferences an aligned AI would use with a higher level of specificity than <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.09836"">I suspect is safe</a> (given the level of confidence we would need to have to make a particular choice).</p><p>Nonetheless this paper looks interesting and covers a number of topics in detail I haven&apos;t seen show up much in the academic literature even if we talk about them here, so I look forward to looking at this paper more closely and possibly having more detailed comments to offer then.</p>",gworley,gordon-seidoh-worley,Gordon Seidoh Worley,

Dennett later turned these ideas into a book and gave more talks, but they were all directed at a less technical audience than LessWrong, so I found I enjoyed this talk more.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Here is the transcript.</i></p><hr><p>Thanks.&nbsp;</p><p>I want to apologize for not attending the afternoon sessions. I was back in my room trying to digest and accommodate and incorporate a few little items from what I've been hearing today. I figured that would happen, and sure enough it did. So you will probably see some little fossil traces of things you said or heard in earlier talks.&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks to the organizers for putting this together and for inviting me. It's been as informative as I expected and hoped it would be and I certainly enjoyed the whole thing.&nbsp;</p><h2>Competence Without Comprehension</h2><p>We've been talking about “Yeah, of course the brain is a computer!” for a long time, and we run into a stone wall of disbelief and fear and loathing in many quarters. I think one thing is you have to stop and ask why that is. Why is this such a repellent idea to so many people? Of course, one reason might be because it's false. Brains really aren't computers, but that's not the new wrinkle that I'm going to be putting forward today. But I do hope there are some new bits.</p><p>Some of you will have heard parts of this before or seen parts of this before, I dare say, but rest assured, there's some stuff you haven't seen before. So don't just do your email or something. You might be surprised.&nbsp;</p><p>Think of all the people that say this “Brains aren't computers”. They're not idiots. There are some good scientists. Roger Penrose insists on this, Gerry Edelman insists on this, Jaak Panksepp. These are industrial strength scientists, and they all dislike the idea that brains are computers. I think in every case you want to say, well, they're not the sort of computer you say they're not. Yeah, you're right about that. But that's not all there is to computers.</p><p>Then there's philosophers, of course, my dear friend John Searle and Raymond Tallis in this country, the poor man's John Searle. I wasn't going to be sarcastic. I'm sorry, I apologize. I probably won't keep to my resolution anyway. So it's not as if people have just conceded that we're right, that brains are computers. So let's look at it more closely.&nbsp;</p><p>Well, if brains aren't computers, what are they? Well, they're not pumps. They're not factories. They're not purifiers. They take information in and give control out.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, they're computers.&nbsp;</p><p>That's almost as good as a very latitudinarian definition of a computer. They're information processing systems, organs. They're just not the kind of computers that critics are imagining.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, why the computer-phobia in the first place? Here I want to return to a theme that's been in my work for a long time because I think there's a very deep seated reason for that fear and it's related very directly to the fear that many people have, especially in my country with evolution.</p><p>Here's my favorite outraged quote from Robert Beverly Mackenzie.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>In the theory with which we have to deal, Absolute Ignorance is the artificer so that we may enunciate as the fundamental principle of the whole system that in order to make a perfect and beautiful machine, it is not requisite to know how to make it. This proposition will be found on careful examination to express in condensed form this central purport of the theory and to express in a few words all Mr. Darwin's meaning, who by a strange inversion of reasoning seems to think absolute ignorance fully qualified to take the place of absolute wisdom in all of the achievements of creative skill.</p></blockquote><p>Bingo. He's got it. That's right. That is what Darwin is saying and it is a strange inversion of reasoning.</p><p>Now, let's look at my other great hero, Alan Turing. Alan, as he was called, my friend Alan this morning in that clip. Here's Turing's strange inversion of reasoning. Before Turing, these were computers: Most of them wore dresses. They had degrees in mathematics. Very often they were people. That was a job description. And what Turing realized is that, although in the old days computers had to understand arithmetic, had to appreciate the reasons for what they were doing, this was fairly high tech job - this was not necessary.&nbsp;</p><p>Now let's put the two together. Here's Darwin's strange inversion of reasoning. By the way, those caps were in the original in the Mackenzie. He was in high dudgeon when he wrote that. Now we're going to vary it.</p><blockquote><p>In order to be a perfect and beautiful computing machine, it is not requisite to know what arithmetic is.</p></blockquote><p>Very similar idea. What they unite in showing, and it is a strange inversion of reasoning, is competence without comprehension. This is my bumper sticker for both ideas.&nbsp;</p><p>In the case of evolution, the process of natural selection itself is competent, has no comprehension, doesn't need comprehension. It brilliantly produces all sorts of marbles of design, competence without any comprehension. No mind at all. Turing launders all the comprehension out of the process of arithmetic makes an automatic clueless arithmetic do-er, and then shows how you can build up and build up and build up from there.</p><p>In other words, in both cases, mind, consciousness and understanding is an effect not a cause. It's not the beginning cause, it's in fact a rather recent effect. So if Darwin explains the intelligent creator - or explains <i>away</i> the intelligent creator - Turing explains the God-like mind. Or explains <i>away</i> the God-like mind.&nbsp;</p><p>I think right there is the main source of the antipathy. People want God-like minds. They want their minds to be flipping mysterious. They want them to be a little miracle between the ears. Any engineering type theory of what the mind is is offensive to them. That means that they are motivated to caricature the idea of computers in the first place. They don't want to think well of computers because they need to keep the very idea at bay.</p><p>I like to say, yeah of course we're robots made of robots made of robots. This idea is, this is a hateful image to many people and so they misimagine computation so that they can go on confidently denying that they could be any such thing. We know there's a whole tradition in the 20th century of eminent people demonstrating that strong AI is impossible, whether it's Penrose or Searle or others. People lap up those arguments and if you try to show them what's wrong with the arguments, they get very impatient with you. They like the conclusion so well they don't want to be nitpicked over the details. They love the fact that an eminent Berkeley professor has shown that there's no such possibility as strong AI, or that a great mathematical physicist has shown this. Don't bother me with the details, I love the conclusion.</p><p>Now this mis-imagination is not hard to understand. What they do is they compare the algorithms with which they're familiar. Things like Word and Photoshop and Email, Google Desktop, with brains and they say “Brains just aren't like that!” Cold, orderly, ultra efficient, rigid, composed of units that are mindless little switches.&nbsp;</p><p>But they are right. Brains aren't like commercial software, the kind that they use. Brains aren't made of Silicon. They're not Von-Neumann machine architectures. But there are other kinds of computers. That's what I really want to talk about.&nbsp;</p><p>I want to propose a particular difference. It's not just that they're protein versus silicon. That's important I guess, but not that important. It's not just that they're analog versus digital. First of all, they're not entirely analog, but in any case, that's not the big difference. Not that they're just that they're parallel rather than sequential serial. These are all well examined differences. The one that I want to look at - less examined, although more examined every day - is this: competitive rather than cooperative.</p><h2>Competitive Rather Than Cooperative</h2><p>The default image that most people have of computation is that it's ultra efficient. There's no waste motion, no cross-purposes, redundancy only for safety. It's hierarchically organized, routines call sub-routines which have to answer and there's controlled prioritization.</p><p>And there's a very deep reason for this. Money, time. You want your software to run as fast as it can in whatever hardware you've got available so you make it ultra efficient, you don't have it lollygagging around. You strip it down, make it as efficient, as bureaucratically neat and clean and effective as you can make it.</p><p>Now, there are opponent processes, but they're what I'm going to call friendly opponent processes. They are politely orchestrated. There's a master of ceremonies in the control system that invites the participants to do their battle and then declares the winner and ushers everybody off. It's very friendly and polite. And I'm talking about a more competitive architecture.</p><p>Compare these models with though, let's say the stock market. Now, here's a question. Is this a computational phenomenon? Blood, sweat, tears, bodies screaming.</p><p>Yeah, it's a computational phenomenon. Information in, information out. Shares get sold and it's a very abstract thing that's going on there in the stock market. Right now we do it with not terribly attractive human beings who earn their living wresting every last penny out of every last share. But that's an important job to do, and they have even some responsibility to be as it were a buyer of last resort. So that's the way we do it now. But it's clear that it can be completely, the people can be removed. In fact, that's happening at a great pace already. A completely computerized stock exchange, I don't think one yet exists, but we're on the verge of it all the time. The people are being eased out of the process.</p><p>I'm reminded of Bill Wood's great older natural language processor, back in the old GOFAI days of natural language processing. He had the classic GOFAI boxology: the acoustic signal came in, and the first thing that had to happen was that there had to be a spectrogram made. And then you need to have the spectrogram analyzed to turn it into a conjecture [about] what phonemes were there. And when they first built the system, they didn't know how to do that. So they hired a phonologist, to sit there looking at the spectrograms and [make] guesses about what the phonemes were. He couldn't hear through the headphones, he had to look at the spectrogram and make guesses. And he was a pretty good guesser. But of course, it was part of a generate and test loop.</p><p>They had a homunculus in the box, they had a real homo sapiens in the box, until they got the rest of the system built. Then they went back and they built the hypothesis generator, the phonology hypothesis generator. Basically, I'm saying the homunculi are about to be discharged from the stock market and so it will be, very clearly, a computational process. So yeah, it is a computational process and it's much more like what I am supposing the brain is.</p><p>I want you to compare Marx. Remember Marx: “To each according to his needs, from each according to his talents.” Wonderful idea. Notice that that's a pretty good model for your average computer. Sub-routines never have to worry whether they're going to get enough cycles to do their work or whether they're going to get enough electricity to stay up and powered. The central committee will take care of everything. They just do their stuff. Happy slaves. They just dutifully do their stuff. They don't have any problems. That's the ideal Marxist structure.&nbsp;</p><p>Compare that with dog-eat-dog, laissez-faire, free-for-all capitalism. And I'm saying the brain is more like the latter. There's no central or higher control. Cooperation is an intermittent achievement, not a precondition.</p><p>Now, I realize at this point, especially coming from America, that I have to do a little preemptive rooting out of an irony. Milton Friedman, Ayn Rand, ""Am I extolling them? Are they my heroes?"" No, no, not at all. No, I'm quite far left as far as American politics goes. But, still, centrally planned economies don't work, and neither does centrally coordinated top-down brains. Even the best cognitive architectures that I know of over the years have been too disciplined, too polite, too bureaucratic. And of course they are made up of millions of identical elements, and that's profoundly unlike the brain. I had a really eye opening conversation with Rod Brooks about this a few months ago. He has a hobby. He's building what you might call a steampunk computer, a pre-electronic computer. It's got solenoids and switches. Just as a stunt, he's building it. Fills a room about as big as this auditorium and it's going to run probably, what, 10 orders of magnitude slower than your desktop and have a memory that would be just invisible in today's computers. But he's building it. It's his project.</p><p>He says the hardest thing is making all the registers and the larger gates alike. The tolerance, just the engineering tolerance, is difficult to achieve. And if they aren’t all <i>really</i> alike, the thing is not going to run well. We just take that for granted in our chips these days. But it's a feature of the hardware, without which the computers that we're using all the time would not work. And it's a feature of the hardware that is not to be found in the brain.&nbsp;</p><p>You've got 100 billion, 100 billion neurons and 10 times more astrocytes. And the astrocytes, we're now beginning to learn, to my dismay, in a way are doing some work. They're doing some information processing work. So the brain has become more and more complicated. And they're all different. There are no two alike. Nobody knows how, I think, nobody knows how to build a basic architecture. A CPU for a computer where the fundamental elements are 100 billion individualistic neurons. You have to think about just what it would take to make that work.</p><p>This idealization has been around ever since McCulloch and Pitts. The very dawn of cognitive science.

I thought, Oh, this is so cool. Multiple inputs, either positive or negative threshold mechanism. Little simple adding device that sees whether or not the excitation exceeds the inhibition by the threshold amount and then a single branching output. Cool, you could build some really interesting networks out of those and really make things happen. That's got to be what a neuron is.&nbsp;</p><p>And of course, that was just exactly what McCulloch and Pitts said and all the classic work which led to many models, [and] was the basis for somewhat the improvements of connectionism.</p><p>All of these, using these logical neurons as good idealizations. And I’m suggesting now that… it was very useful, very useful at the time. But it's one of those idealizations that has outlived its usefulness and we have to throw it away.&nbsp;</p><p>Just to drive home the points, I don't know if you've seen these wonderful micrograph elapsed time animations– not animations, but actual videos, microscope videos, of neurons in a petri dish seeking out connections. Groping around, little exploratory, dendritic spines going out, moving along. Now, that's what neurons are like.&nbsp;</p><p>I was going to show, you probably all seen it, the bio visions, wonderful animation of what goes on inside a cell with the motor proteins and all. But it's absolutely stunning. Google “bio visions”. I have it right here on my laptop, but for some reason it's incompatible with the projector so I couldn't show it to you.</p><p>Bio visions... you will see the breadth and complexity of what goes on inside every cell and every neuron. That's where the robots are, down among the motor proteins. The individual neurons are exploratory little devils, and they're sending out processes and then reabsorbing them. Something's controlling that. This is, if not goal-directed, it is at least a goal-guided behavior. They're trying to do something. What they're trying to do is they're trying to network, they're trying to improve their influence by making more connections with other neurons.</p><p>You have to remember that every neuron is a descendant of eukaryotes that survived on their own for over a billion years. Single celled organisms. This is my favorite picture of the tree of life, Leo Eisenberg's. It's really very pleasing.</p><figure><img src=""https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/cY4h42LgmbL_kz__mkg1m3M6sHEjGYwFpLNR6U7Q313vO876eSeY4JIMIrduVMPLxcGZ-WUI9N0ohwl9oNPiaFcMqLtdxmAl_P-_TLnNpYcsrBqphxUWmdguR34uEL5qt9o2gTnF""></figure><p>So here's the beginning of life and... was it bacteria or archaea, it's not quite clear. But then we had the great eukaryotic revolution and everything else that you can see, those are all eukaryotes. Basically, to a first approximation, any life form that's visible to the naked eye is a eukaryote, a multicellular eukaryote.</p><p>Neurons are just direct descendents of some of those unicellular eukaryotes that fended for their own once they'd descended from the prokaryotes, and they had a long time to fend for themselves and they succeeded. Then their descendants got– not so much trapped as as enlisted, in multicellular organisms where of course they've changed quite a bit.</p><p>But maybe they haven't changed all that much. Maybe the right way to think of them is as little, relatively stupid, but still competent agents, trapped, imprisoned in a large collection of other such agents inside a multicellular body. My post-docs jokingly call this theme in our ideas, our thinking brain wars. That's how undisciplined we think it is. Where there's real, not notional, competition, micro agents where their own agendas.</p><p>Now, among the people who've had ideas like this, Tecumseh Fitch, his paper <a href=""http://www.newdualism.org/papers/W.Fitch/Fitch-BioPhilos2008.pdf""><i><u>Nano Intentionality and Biology and Philosophy</u></i></a>. On the surface it's a criticism of my line on intentionality and original intentionality, but the better reading, the more fruitful reading is it's a look at that issue and a useful one indeed. Eric Baum - how many of you have read Eric's book, <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/What-Thought-Bradford-Book-Eric/dp/0262524570""><i><u>What is Thought?</u></i></a> It has some lines very much along this line. He gave me this great term for the kind of architectures that we're turning our back on, <i>Politburo</i> architectures. Echoing the old Soviet Union. Those are the kind of control systems that we're suggesting are not to be found in the brain.</p><p>Sebastian Seung is a young neuroscientist at MIT and in his presidential address, or keynote address at, Society for Neuroscience couple of years ago, he spoke about selfish neurons and hedonistic synapses. He has an earlier period way back to 2003 where he talks about hedonistic synapses. Now, these are interesting metaphors. I think we should take them quite seriously. I think that once we look at the brain as composed of elements of selfish neurons, we get a much better handle on some of the phenomena that we're trying to understand.</p><h2>Worrying Abstractions About Information Processing?</h2><p>Now, as you know for my whole career I've been a defender of strong AI and a defender of the computer metaphor for the brain, and I'm still a defender of it, but the best, the most thought provoking critic that I've encountered lately is Terry Deacon. I wonder how many of you have read Terry, have many of you read this book? Well, I'm a big fan of his earlier book, The Symbolic Species, which I think has got many really good ideas which have not been properly acknowledged and taken up and incorporated into the thinking of many people in cognitive science. This book is a more ambitious book by half and it's not an easy read, but I decided it's a very important book even though I don't agree with it at all.</p><p>Let me put it this way. I, and I bet most of you, have been inoculated against what I'm going to call ‘romantic science’ on these issues. We've had a whole tradition of romantic critics of the computer and the engineering metaphors. We have Maturana with autopoiesis and Varela and Evan Thompson - my former post doc - and many others. You can form your own list, Prager Gene, and there's a whole lot of, I just call them romantic scientists, who have argued that this whole idea of artificial intelligence is a travesty, that it misses the super wonderful essence of life and mind in one way or another. So I've been pretty well inoculated against this and yet Terry's book really seems to me to have new arguments worth taking quite seriously. And I'm just going to highlight a couple of items from them. (I have a review that's coming out in quarterly review of biology, but it's not coming out until December and it's embargo till then so I can't put it on my website. But in due course that will be out. [<a href=""https://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/dennett/papers/achingvoids.pdf""><u>Review is now available here.</u></a>])</p><p>Deacon has the following arresting idea about Shannon and Shannon information. We tend to applaud and for very good reason Shannon's brilliant divorce of information from thermodynamics, his creation of the basic structure for information theory, the brilliant abstraction of communication between a sender and a receiver over a channel. And of course, without this wonderful theoretical analysis, we wouldn't have the bits and bytes and terabytes and bioinformatics, and all the rest of the language of information theory. But of course, we also know that Shannon information is not the same as the information that we're usually talking about in cognitive science, which is sematic information one sort or another. That's still an embarrassing lacuna in our foundations.&nbsp;</p><p>I think, maybe not in AI, but I think a great many people in cognitive science and cognitive neuroscience and cognitive psychology are very comfortable throwing the term information around because they think they are licensed by Shannon information. No, they're not, and that is an unrepaired pothole in our road.</p><p>But amazingly, Deacon says, wonderful though Shannon information theory is, the flaw lies right at the outset. In that - as you will remember, the diagrams that show a channel with a sender and a receiver and a code, and then you work out from the ensemble how many bits are being sent and so forth - this right there, the sender and receiver were embarrassing homunculi that really have to be discharged one way or another and we've never really figured out how to discharge them. It presupposes two cooperative agents.&nbsp;</p><p>What happens to those agents when we turn to semantic information? Well, if you're like me, you've all along basically assumed that a computer itself can stand in. That we don't need a human agent, we can just have an artificial agent, a computer agent, that it can be the touchstone, the receiver of information. Also, we say, we won't talk about the sender when the sender is the whole environment. We can talk about the sender when the sender is the eye, what the frog’s eye tells the frog's brain. But we don't talk about the tree sending information to the eye. We don't talk about that.</p><p>I think this is even very plausible, it's still very plausible. After all, we're quite careful. We say, look, in economics you can replace sales clerks with vending machines with no loss. They can serve all the functions quite well and we can take Shannon senders and receivers and replace them with artificial agents, computer agents and carry on with no difficulty. Well, Deacon thinks not.&nbsp;</p><p>Why? What does he think? He says this (this is not quoting him). AI researchers have postponed consideration of such phenomena as energy capture, unaided reproductions, self-repair and open-ended self revision. Those are hard problems. We'll save those for later. Expecting you to reap the benefits of this simplification by first getting clear about the purely informational phenomena of learning and self guidance. Right?</p><p>It seems to me that does accurately describe the practice.&nbsp;</p><p>And if it does, this is a gamble. We're saying, look, yeah, yeah, yeah. Eventually I have to worry about making a whole organism that can capture energy and has a metabolism, but that's related. I don't need that. Hey, I'm doing a chess program. Chess program just gets its energy from the plug that stick and goes in the wall. We don't worry about that for now. And ditto for self-repair and of course reproduction.&nbsp;</p><p>Deacon thinks, however, that by abandoning the link to thermodynamics, we settle for what he calls parasitical computational architectures. And he thinks this is a fundamental feature of the architecture that is parasitical. And this is something that we recognize when we confront Ray Kurzweil and he talks about how the singularity is near and how people aren't going to be necessary. We say, wait a minute, who's going to repair the robots? Who's going to repair the hardware when the second law of thermodynamics takes its toll?</p><p>Sometimes people say, well, the superintelligences will keep us around as custodians and repairmen for a while until they figure out how to do that. What Deacon is saying is, the architecture you get when you leave off, when you finesse, when you postpone the metabolism problem, the cell and the self-repair problem to take the two most obvious, just the architecture you're going to get is just going to be the wrong architecture. It's not going to do the work.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, why on earth would anybody think that? Well, I'm going to try to show you.</p><h2>Thinking Tools and Feral Neurons</h2><p>So, according to Deacon, if you think a self-repairing, self-replacing computer is something to design later, you're mistaken. Well, we'll sneak up on why that might be. So think about the brain's plasticity. It is stunning. Many experiments show how, for instance, let's think of Mike Merzenich's experiments: first you map the somatosensory cortex of a rhesus monkey and see where each finger is represented. Then you suture two fingers together for a few weeks. Then you go in and map again, and you see that the area has <i>shrunk</i>. It's now one area that's representing the two that were together. And the neural tracks that were previously devoted to looking at those two fingers are now being used for other purposes. That's a very dramatic example and there's a tremendous amount of that plasticity. Every time people go looking for it, they find it even to the point where it makes chronic experiments with living brains really hard to do because when you go back, your landmarks may be just wrong.&nbsp;</p><p>That's a real feature and as far as I know, there's nothing that is even a very good approximation of that in the hardware that we are designing our programs for.</p><p>Well, what explains the brain's plasticity? Very simple. There's neurons looking for work. Neurons, if they don't get work, they're going to die. They're going to be absorbed, reabsorbed and their parts reused.&nbsp;</p><p>François Jacob had the great saying that the dream of every cell is to become two cells. That's very true in general, but neurons have lost that dream because they don't reproduce. So they don't have offspring in the future, but they just want to stay alive as long as they can. They are designed by evolution to do that, and to be ready to exert themselves and use energy to grope about, trying to find a better way of making a living locally. Maybe that economic structure also is a prerequisite for truly creative, open ended intelligence. I'll say a bit about why that might be.</p><p>Here's a slide I've been using for a year or two. Some of you may have seen it before. These two very similar structures are both artifacts created by organisms. The one on the left is an Australian termite castle and the one on the right of course is Gaudí’s famous Sagrada Familia church in Barcelona.</p><figure style=""width:73.79%;""><img src=""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Ox5j4V01uCDlpM_hGqBzstq64RsecSWsBflBR4TO2g265nh6wy6Wb_xotV4hvsNEOep9WfxGE_fSSCaVOnhGs7DaOPQ0yRBCmW_Fnbi6atnKTOShF08h8r_kA4bU6dinacPt41ez""></figure><p>They are very similar in outward appearance, but the R&amp;D that went into them, the design and construction, profoundly different. In the case of the termite castle, this is bottom-up, mindless, local control building. There's a queen termite, but she's not the boss. She doesn't know what she's doing. There's no blueprints, there's no plans, there's no hierarchy. It's just individual termites doing their mindless little thing all under the control of local triggers and their own genetic dispositions, and these amazing structures get built. Competence without comprehension. They haven't the faintest idea what they're doing and they don't have to.</p><p>Gaudí - this is so convenient for me - is the very caricature model, the very paragon of the intelligent designer. The genius, the charismatic genius with the manifestos and the blueprints. And he's bossing a team of underlings who are bossing a team of underlings who are bossing a team of workers, and it's just top-down dictatorial, intelligent design or would-be intelligent design from Gaudí. So here we see two similar artifacts made by processes which are fundamentally different in their underlying organization. The difference between clueless termites and Gaudí is pretty astounding.&nbsp;</p><p>But now think of this. What have you got between your ears?&nbsp;</p><p>200 million termites.</p><p>How do you get a termite colony type brain to become a Gaudí type mind? We can understand how termite colonies can be pretty good cognitive agents. They're really clever. I mean, termite colonies as a whole engage in some pretty clever and quite discriminating and adaptive behaviors. And a lot of animals of course do too. But Gaudí is, there's something very different going on there. And the thing is: how is that possible when what he's got between his ears looks for all the world, like just a larger version of - not a million termites, but 200 billion neurons, but the neurons are even more clueless than the termites? How do you get 200 billion neurons with no boss neuron, no king? How do you get them organized to do the stuff that makes it possible to be a Gaudí?</p><p>Well, this is the key, I think. My former student, Bo Dahlbom, was saying:</p><blockquote><p>You can't do much carpentry with your bare hands. You can't do much thinking with your bare brain.</p></blockquote><p>Animals have bare brains, we don't. We have lots of thinking tools. And the thinking tools that we put into our brains, the thinking tools that find their way into our brains are the key, I think, to the transformation, the creation of the virtual architecture on which our intelligent minds depend. Gaudí didn't have a bare brain. He was teeming with mind tools. Memes in short. Memes like viruses are not alive, but like viruses, they're subject to natural selection.</p><p>I wonder if this audience is as repelled by the idea of memes as many of the audiences that I have to deal with. In the humanities I find that people have a really visceral reaction against it. I'm slowly eroding that, I think, and I've got some more considerations. That's what I'm working on right now, is an enlarged and better and improved theory of cultural evolution, which starts out very Darwinian, and then gets less and less Darwinian.</p><p>There's no question that viruses are absolutely fine candidates for natural selection, but they're not even alive. What are they? They are, as I like to say, they are ‘strings of nucleic acid with attitude’. By attitude, I just mean something about their shape gives them a disposition to foster their own replication under various circumstances, and the ones that are really good at this thrive and the ones that aren't go extinct. So you don't have to be alive, you don't have to have a metabolism, you don't have to have sex to be a proper item for natural selection. And what are memes: they're software with attitude, they're data structures with attitude, same deal. They can evolve by natural selection by differential replication, same as viruses do.</p><p>Here I'm going to give you a really unsettling possibility. And of course, it may not amount to anything in the end, but I think it's more than fun to think about: Feral neurons.&nbsp;</p><p>You know about feral animals. Domesticated animals like pigs, sheep, if you let them go feral, if you release them from domestication, they very quickly resume a lot of their wild talents.&nbsp;</p><p>Why? Because it turns out that the domestication and breeding have not erased those genes. They've just commented them out. They're still in there, they're just not expressed anymore. Or they're almost in there, they're beginning to fall apart, but they're still in there. A very small genetic change simply erases the brackets and they're commented back in and then you get, in just a few generations, you get pigs that are very much like wild boars, sheep that are very much like wild sheep and so forth. Those are feral animals.</p><p>I'm suggesting that maybe some of the neurons in your brain are encouraged to go feral to regain some of the individuality and resourcefulness of their unicellular ancestors from half a billion years ago.&nbsp;</p><p>Why? Well, they're released from domesticity where they've been working in the service of animal cognition, uncomplainingly, so that their talents can be exploited by invading memes competing for influence. That there's a coevolution between genetic and cultural evolution. And once a brain becomes a target for meme invasion, the relaxation or the re-expression of some otherwise suppressed talents of neurons creates a better environment, a better architectural environment, for the competition of memes to go forward. Armies of the descendants of prisoners, now enslaved by the invaders.</p><p>Did you just get the idea? I want to make sure you see what might be interesting about it. It's that in general, the cells of a multicellular organism are dutiful little slaves, happy slaves. They don't strike out on their own. They're good team players. If you've seen <i>A Bug's Life</i>, Woody Allen plays the role of the renegade ant. Or is it a bee? Well, in any case. Most of your neurons are, I think, they're cooperative neurons too. I am suggesting that it's possible that cortical neurons in a creature that's strongly under selection for imbibing culture may have their body plans and their talents revised in the direction of being more individualistic, more selfish so that they are not as regimented in their behavior.</p><h2>Doing Reductionism on Darwinism</h2><p>Now, another book – this is uncle Dan's list of books I think you should read – Peter Godfrey Smith's <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Darwinian-Populations-Natural-Selection-Godfrey-Smith/dp/0199596271""><i><u>Darwinian Populations and Natural Selection</u></i></a>. There's <a href=""https://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/dennett/papers/homunculi.pdf""><u>a review of that</u></a> on my website. That isn’t embargoed, so if you're interested in it... But one of the ideas in this, which I think is really a wonderful thinking tool is this idea of Darwinian spaces. This is one of Peter's diagrams.</p><p>A Darwinian space is just a three dimensional cube of this. And there's many dimensions you could put on the axes, but you can use this both to plot trajectories and to look at similarities in variation in differences. And this is one of the basic ones.</p><figure><img src=""https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/aDb_bjjXWzjOgRI-m0PGCEElFtqXJHBgsvSqdujxoUG2SUyEHiT1DHx_Iq949UwD4Nm-6m9xT66GteBxBHyCGFtvRwtw2m2tqlGGgQrPTqoVctdj1wge0qUALIC1e9ucraDy-MzQ""></figure><p>Way up in the upper right hand corner, (1,1,1), we have paradigm Darwinian processes. These are the parade case processes that are Darwinian if anything is. In the lower left hand corner, these are phenomena that aren't Darwinian at all. And the three dimensions that we're looking at here are continuity, smoothness of fitness landscape. If you've got a nice smooth fitness landscape, then hill climbing works and that's a requirement for Darwinian process. You have fidelity of heredity along here. If you don't have high enough fidelity of replication, you get the error catastrophe for instance. Then he has dependence of realized fitness differences on intrinsic properties, which is along this dimension. Where that's not the case, you get drift. Of course, drift is also where, well, drift can be anywhere along here, but be particularly strong where there's a rugged landscape.</p><p>But look, he's put human cells up here. And that's because, although human cells, when they proliferate – both in the fetus and in early life and development – there's a population explosion. And it's a quasi-Darwinian process. It's quasi-Darwinian particularly in the S-dimension, because what's important is not so much the intrinsic properties of the cells – for instance, neural stem cells are pretty much all alike. It's location, location, location, which is not an intrinsic property. So where you have selection for location, you have an only quasi-Darwinian process. So I hope you can see, this is a diagram which permits you to look at both variations, look at phenomena that are only somewhat Darwinian.</p><p>Here's a nice point about this. We want to be Darwinians about Darwinism itself and recognize that it doesn't have an essence. There are hemi, semi, demi varieties of Darwinian processes. So we can be Darwinian about Darwinism.</p><p>And we can also look at what he calls de-Darwinization. De-Darwinization is when a phenomenon over evolutionary time moves away from Darwinian towards less Darwinian. Human cells were great case of that, because their ancestors were selected for their individual intrinsic fitness. Now that they've become part of a multicellular organism, they're now being selected not so much for intrinsic features, but for location. So there's been a de-Darwinizing. He has other examples of de-Darwinizing phenomena.</p><h2>Cultural Evolution</h2><p>But now I want to look finally at culture. This is my attempted irenic - not ironic, but irenic - peaceful resolution of a problem that scares so many people when you talk about culture. Because here's what I want to say.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src=""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/lmP4mJghO_x07BZ9rJueQhrwslBUafILl9s45MWsFveH6zt1hj01XEi1q4bZJhS2Sr_Wz6Kz-0RnaBP6lu7XRXXhYvxi4_k6AOyF_tXqiLWs1tEWt2dXU0kxF6Z4NhljCtS2huDu""></figure><p>Now we're going to turn Darwin's inversion upside down. Up in this corner, we're going to put intelligent design, but meaning by that, not God, but intelligent human designers, people like Turing and Gaudí and Picasso. And down in the lower corner, we're going to put Darwinian design, mindless bottom-up, purposeless. So the dimensions I have here are comprehension, local versus global, and random versus directed search.</p><p>If you've got the blindest of blind trial-and-error search in a process where there's minimal comprehension, then you're down here, right here. The termite capsules are somewhere in the middle ground.&nbsp;</p><p>Oh, there's a nice example. I don't have the slides that goes with it, but I've put it on this slide. I'll tell you about the Polynesian canoes. This is lovely quote that Godfrey Smith comes up with by a French philosopher named Alain who says, he's actually talking about not Polynesian canoes, but about the Breton fishing vessels. And he says, ""The boats are copied. The ones that come back are copied."" And if the sea is doing the selection, and this is Darwinian, it's basically, the boat builders, they don't have to know anything about boat building. They just copy what comes back. Over time, their boats become more and more seaworthy.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, they may have lots of ideas about boat design. They may be right, they may be wrong, it doesn't really matter that much. They may be able to speed up the design improvement process a little bit, in which case they're over here a little bit more, but it's actually not all that necessary. Once they've got a good design, they just cling to it. They're very conservative and it works and they don't have to... They can be the beneficiaries of their lovely boat designs without understanding why these are good. In the same way that the termites can be beneficiaries of their beautiful castle without understanding why it's good. This is competence without comprehension.&nbsp;</p><p>But, what's happened is, when culture started out, human culture, it started out down in this corner. Now we're moving up towards intelligent design. What's interesting is, it's even happening to the word meme, which started out as a word for an author-less cultural item which spread like a virus and now you have competitions on the internet to intelligently design a meme that will go viral. That's really contrary to what Dawkins was talking about at the time. But what's happened is those memes are memes that are living or purporting to live up in the high ground here.</p><p>Now, what's nice about this diagram, I think, is we can look at the diagram and we can say traditional humanities approaches to culture. Think of all culture is existing up here at the top levels and pretty much over in this corner. Culture consists of brilliantly designed by geniuses, treasures that are appreciated. We understand why they're great, that's why we preserve them and maintain them and bequeath them to our children as great treasures and so forth. An economic model works very well for that. These are treasures.&nbsp;</p><p>But a lot of human culture isn't like that. A lot of human culture is not even useful. It just replicates because it can, it's like the cold virus. What's it good for? Nothing. It's just good for itself. Similarly, there are a lot of memes that are, they're just good for themselves. And in between is where most human culture resides, in a space that I call ‘foible exploiting’.</p><p>This is where in a quasi-evolutionary process, all the third of flaws and cracks and lacunas and weak spots, the good enough for government work flaws in our designs, get exploited by agents who often themselves don't understand why they're doing it or why this is a good idea. And it's the arms races that go on in that area that help design and redesign everything from religions to con games to sports and everything else in the world.</p><p>The basic memes are words. What are words? Words are memes that can be pronounced. In fact, the big mistake that Richard Dawkins made when he wrote <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Selfish-Gene-Popular-Science/dp/0192860925""><i><u>The Selfish Gene</u></i></a> was in not stressing the fact that words themselves are the best example of memes. Very few of them are invented by anybody. A few words are coined, but in general words have no authors. They have very clear genealogies, which have been studied for centuries, going back hundreds of years. You take them on, you don't acquire them by deliberate... you don't go out and buy them, and you don't seek them out. They just come to rest in you.&nbsp;</p><p>So what it means is that we have to start thinking about our minds as software, because words are virtual machines. Ray Jackendoff, in his wonderful book <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Foundations-Language-Meaning-Grammar-Evolution/dp/0199264376""><i><u>Foundations of Language</u></i></a>, says that words, lexical items, are semi-autonomous informational structures with multiple roles to play in cognition. How do words get installed in a brain? By an implantation process, which is itself somewhat gradual, takes a few hearings. First time a baby hears a word, it's a sound in a context. Second time, it's a familiar sound. Sometimes in the familiar, similar contexts. Third hearing, it's that sound again. Now the context a little clearer, but an auditory anchor has been lodged in the brain. According to Deb Roy's research, it's about five or six hearings of a word, and then the kid starts trying to say it. So there's the gradual establishment and installation of that virtual machine in that kid's head. It's like a Java app, but it just takes a little longer to put it in your neck-top.</p><p>Remember, children learn two or three words a day from birth to age five. They also learn lots of other memes, words without auditory anchors. (Remember, words are the memes that can be pronounced.) Now, these are selfish memes competing for reproduction in the brain. Every time you say a word to yourself, just let's talk about words for a moment, you make another copy. That's a descendant in your head. But they're also stupid. They're selfish, but stupid. Murray [Shanahan] was talking about how we solve the frame problem and I want to say that I now want to articulate how this view looks at that.</p><p>Instead of having a miraculously intelligent designer that knows where the relevant things are, you have lots of stupid memes. Some of them words, some of them not. They're all trying to get replicated all the time and they're competing using coalitions of neurons to do it. They're competing for influence in the current circumstances and the relevance tuning, the relevance tracking occurs by a Darwinian process without anybody having to understand, without the neural tracks having to understand what they're doing. Competence with partial comprehension.</p><p>One of the things that got me thinking about all this is: I kept running into these neuroscientists saying, ""Dopamine is the currency of reward."" Now, there's something really weird about that. If they really mean currency, I want to know, what do the neurons buy with their dopamine? And then I realized that wasn't such a stupid question because neurons grow receptors in response to the amount of neuromodulator and neurotransmittor that they get. So there is an important sense in which they are feeding off their neuromodulators. And what they're buying is time and influence and the capacity to go on making more connections. So there they are groping around in their little neuronic world, trying to maximize, to stay healthy and maximize their dopamine so that they can keep going.</p><p>So not just brain plasticity, but also relevant sifting and problem solving is accomplished by bottom-up competition among largely clueless agents. As I mentioned, they're like Java applets.&nbsp;</p><p>Let me do my little exercise. I enjoy this. I think you will too. So, evolution discovered digitalization before we did, before the digital revolution. Here's a famous example from Oliver Selfridge. What do you see?

I’m not an expert on the topics I cover here, and I’d appreciate feedback or comments in relation to any mistakes, unclear phrasings, etc. (and just in general!).</em></p>
<p>We are often forced to make decisions under conditions of uncertainty. This may be empirical uncertainty (e.g., what is the likelihood that nuclear war would cause human extinction?), or it may be moral uncertainty (e.g., is the wellbeing of future generations morally important?).</p>
<p>But what if you don’t believe that “morally important” is a coherent concept? What if you’re a <em>moral antirealist</em> and/or <em>subjectivist</em>, and thus reject the idea that there are any (objective) moral facts? Would existing work on moral uncertainty (see <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/4NFwxwzLzpiikfkk3/p/oZsyK4SjnPe6HGia8"">my</a> <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/4NFwxwzLzpiikfkk3/p/gvrojpfzizDvmPJJN"">prior</a> <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/4NFwxwzLzpiikfkk3/p/dX7vNKg4vex5vxWCW"">posts</a>) still be relevant to you?</p>
<p>I think that a lot of it is, to a large extent, for the reasons discussed in this footnote.<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-MxPMzRNX8kkkR7fNH-1"" id=""fnref-MxPMzRNX8kkkR7fNH-1"">[1]</a></sup> But I think that, to directly discuss <em>how</em> that work is relevant to antirealists and/or subjectivists, it would help to speak not of <em>moral</em> uncertainty but of <em>value uncertainty</em> (VU; i.e., uncertainty about what one “values” or “prefers”). Doing so also helps us to categorise different <em>types</em> of VU, and potential ways of resolving each of these types of VU. A final benefit is that such an analysis of VUs also has substantial relevance for moral <em>realists</em>, and for work on AI alignment.</p>
<p>So this post will:</p>
<ol>
<li>Clarify what I mean by “values” in this context</li>
<li>Name, briefly describe, and briefly suggest responses to four types of VU, and two types of situations that actually <em>aren’t</em> VU, but could look as though they are</li>
<li>Return to the question of who and what these ideas are relevant for</li>
</ol>
<h1>Values</h1>
<p>I should clarify a few points about what I mean by “values” in this post:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I mean what a person <em>actually</em> values (or would if they knew more, or will in the future, or would if “idealised”), not what a person’s <em>explicitly endorsed</em> moral theory suggests they <em>should</em> value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For example, after a bunch of caveats and moral uncertainty, I roughly identify as a classical utilitarian. However, <em>in reality</em>, <em>psychologically speaking</em>, I also value things other than whatever maximally increases the wellbeing of conscious beings.</p>
<ul>
<li>On the other hand, I don’t believe that people <em>actually</em> have any specific, neat, ongoing set of values, of the sort that could be used to form a utility function or something like that (see <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CSEdLLEkap2pubjof/research-agenda-v0-9-synthesising-a-human-s-preferences-into?commentId=wH9ZuaESWKr8PRqGW"">this thread</a>). So this post is basically about how to move towards better understanding whatever’s the <em>closest equivalent</em> a person <em>does</em> have to a specific, neat, ongoing set of values.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’ll often talk about “a person’s” values, which could mean <em>one’s own</em> values, <em>someone else’s</em> values, <em>a group’s</em> values, or <em>humanity as a whole’s</em> values.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Types of value uncertainty</h1>
<p>I’ll now name, briefly describe, and briefly suggest responses to four (overlapping) types of VU, and then two types of situations that <em>aren’t</em> VU but could <em>appear</em> to be VU. I hope to later write a post for each type of VU (and the two related situations), where I’ll go into more detail and highlight more connections to prior work (e.g., by <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/AytzBuJSD9v2cWu3m/three-kinds-of-moral-uncertainty"">Kaj Sotala</a> and <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/FobXYjmZD254MNk2S/intuitive-supergoal-uncertainty"">Justin Shovelain</a>).</p>
<p>Note that this is <em>not</em> the only (and perhaps not the best) way to categorise types of VU or frame this sort of discussion. It also may leave out important types. I’m open to feedback about all of this, and in fact one motivation for summarising this categorisation scheme here and then <em>later</em> writing more about each type is that doing so allows those later posts to be influenced by feedback on this one.</p>
<h2>Present</h2>
<p><strong>Description/cause:</strong> Present VU is uncertainty about a person’s (or group’s) <em>current</em> values. This occurs when multiple different sets of underlying values could explain the data (i.e., the behaviours you’ve observed from the person),<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-MxPMzRNX8kkkR7fNH-2"" id=""fnref-MxPMzRNX8kkkR7fNH-2"">[2]</a></sup> essentially creating a standard <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve_fitting"">curve fitting</a> problem.</p>
<p>One cause of Present VU is a lack of knowledge about something about the person <em>other than</em> their values, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>What decision theory they’re using and how rational they are. E.g., does the fact that <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/4dHMdK5TLN6xcqtyc/p/cnC2RMWEGiGpJv8go"">Alice left studying till the last minute</a> reflect that she values being stressed, or just reflect <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_discounting"">hyperbolic discounting</a>?</li>
<li>Their capabilities. <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/zvrZi95EHqJPxdgps/why-we-need-a-theory-of-human-values"">E.g., does Kasparov’s</a> loss to DeepBlue indicate that he values losing, or just that he didn’t <em>know how</em> to win?</li>
<li>Their beliefs. E.g., does this person’s continued smoking indicate that they value smoking more than they value additional years of life, or just that they don’t know the effects of smoking?</li>
</ul>
<p>But Present VU can also occur when, even holding constant all of the above factors, different sets of values would lead to the same behaviours (e.g., breathing, or following <a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Basic_AI_drives"">convergent instrumental goals</a>) in a given circumstance.</p>
<p>This type of VU seems similar to the focus of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apprenticeship_learning#Via_inverse_reinforcement_learning"">inverse reinforcement learning</a>. However, with Present VU, the “learner” may not be an AI. (In fact, Present VU may involve <em>you</em> trying to learn <em>your own</em> values, in which case it could perhaps be thought of as “Introspective” VU.)</p>
<p><strong>Potential ways to resolve this:</strong> Gather more data, or do more thinking, regarding the person’s decision theory, rationality, capabilities, and/or beliefs.</p>
<p>Think about the assumptions you’re making about those factors. Try making different assumptions, and/or “minimal” assumptions. (Similar ideas, and some difficulties with them, have been discussed before by <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M9CvESSeVc"">Armstrong</a> and <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/uR3znuBnaevssYDZY/rfc-meta-ethical-uncertainty-in-agi-alignment"">Worley</a>, among others.)</p>
<p>Observe more of the person’s behaviours, ideally under different circumstances.</p>
<p>(Similar data and thinking regarding <em>other people’s</em> behaviours, rationality, etc. may also help to some extent. E.g., evidence about the degree to which <em>people in general</em> hyperbolically discount things could help you interpret the behaviour of some other person for whom there is no such data.)</p>
<h2>Informational</h2>
<p><strong>Description/cause:</strong> Informational VU is uncertainty about what a person’s (or group’s) values <em>would be</em> if their knowledge or beliefs <em>improved</em>.<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-MxPMzRNX8kkkR7fNH-3"" id=""fnref-MxPMzRNX8kkkR7fNH-3"">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>We could divide the potential sources of improved knowledge or beliefs into three categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>New experiences. E.g., Alan values not eating refried beans, because they look like sewage, but he’d reverse this value if he ever actually <em>tried</em> eating them.<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-MxPMzRNX8kkkR7fNH-4"" id=""fnref-MxPMzRNX8kkkR7fNH-4"">[4]</a></sup></li>
<li>Learning new facts relevant to certain values. E.g., Betty doesn’t value the wellbeing of octopi, but would if she learned more about their neurology and behaviour.</li>
<li>Improved ontologies (related to <a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Ontological_crisis"">ontological</a> <a href=""https://intelligence.org/files/OntologicalCrises.pdf"">crises</a>). E.g., Cameron values “his future self’s” wellbeing, so he’d have to find a new way to map that value onto the world if he accepted the idea that people don’t fundamentally retain the “same identity” over time (relevant discussion <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/identity-ethics/#IDM"">here</a>). See also <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/KLaJjNdENsHhKhG5m/ontological-crisis-in-humans"">this</a> and <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/EhNCnCkmu7MwrQ7yz/future-directions-for-ambitious-value-learning?commentId=krcwYcuTQRp9DBdZY"">this</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Potential ways to resolve this:</strong> Think about (or use models/simulations to work out) what new experiences, new facts, or improvements in ontologies would be most likely to affect the person’s values, and <em>how</em> the person’s values would change in response. (This could perhaps be informed by ideas from <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/vADtvr9iDeYsCDfxd/value-of-information-four-examples"">value</a> <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_of_information"">of information analysis</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_analysis"">sensitivity analysis</a>.)</p>
<p>Try to expose the person to, or teach them about, these (or other) new experiences, new facts, and improvements in ontologies. (Note that this would involve not just predicting but actually <em>causing</em> changes in values. This should be done cautiously, if at all.)</p>
<p>For resolving uncertainty about how <em>your own</em> values would change if your knowledge or beliefs improved, this might look like just learning a lot, particularly about things you’re especially uncertain about and that seem especially relevant to your values.</p>
<h2>Predictive</h2>
<p><strong>Description/cause:</strong> Predictive VU is uncertainty about what a person’s (or group’s) values <em>will be</em> in the future.<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-MxPMzRNX8kkkR7fNH-5"" id=""fnref-MxPMzRNX8kkkR7fNH-5"">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>This overlaps with Present and Informational VU, because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learning more about a person’s <em>current</em> values obviously helps you predict what their values will be in the future.</li>
<li>One source of the changes that <em>will</em> occur in a person’s values is improvements that <em>will</em> occur in the person’s knowledge and beliefs. Thus, a subset of what Informational VU is about is also a subset of what Predictive VU is about.</li>
</ul>
<p>But Predictive VU also includes uncertainty about changes that will occur in a person’s values for <em>other</em> reasons, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>changes in knowledge and beliefs that <em>aren’t</em> improvements (e.g., learning misinformation about immigrants)</li>
<li>being persuaded via the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elaboration_likelihood_model"">peripheral route</a> (e.g., seeing what attractive or high-status people are doing)</li>
<li>changes in life circumstances (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4045107/"">e.g.</a>, nearing the end of life, and thus coming to place greater value on spending quality time with good friends and family, and less value on maintaining large networks)</li>
<li>what could be called “biological” changes (e.g., changes in hormone levels that lead to changes in libido, risk-taking, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Potential ways to resolve this:</strong> The potential methods for resolving Present and Informational VU are relevant for parts of Predictive VU. E.g., thinking about what a person <em>will</em> learn about, and how it <em>will</em> affect their values, can help resolve parts of both Informational and Predictive VU.</p>
<p>Also, for all parts of this VU, techniques that are effective for prediction in general (e.g., reference class forecasting) should be useful. E.g., an aspiring effective altruist could predict that their values are likely to <a href=""https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/EMKf4Gyee7BsY2RP8/michaela-s-shortform?commentId=a3dN6Mehzzipyu5sg"">shift away</a> from “typical EA values” over time, based on <a href=""https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/mZWFEFpyDs3R6hD3r/empirical-data-on-value-drift"">data indicating that that’s a common pattern</a>, as well as the more general <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-of-history_illusion"">end-of-history illusion</a><strong>.</strong></p>
<h2>Idealised</h2>
<p><strong>Description/cause:</strong> Idealised VU is uncertainty about:</p>
<ul>
<li>what values a person’s (or group’s) “<a href=""https://www.openphilanthropy.org/2017-report-consciousness-and-moral-patienthood#AppendixA"">idealised self</a>” or “<a href=""https://intelligence.org/files/IdealAdvisorTheories.pdf"">ideal advisor</a>” would have or advise;</li>
<li>what values a person would have after “a process of idealisation” or after reaching “<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflective_equilibrium"">reflective equilibrium</a>”;</li>
<li>what values a person would have after “<a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Coherent_Extrapolated_Volition"">coherent</a> <a href=""https://arbital.com/p/normative_extrapolated_volition/"">extrapolated volition</a>” (CEV);</li>
<li>what set of consistent values is closest to a person’s current, inconsistent values (see, e.g., <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ky988ePJvCRhmCwGo/using-vector-fields-to-visualise-preferences-and-make-them"">this post</a>); or</li>
<li>something else along these lines.</li>
</ul>
<p>(Note that it seems to me that it’s hard to actually specify those key terms, and I won’t properly try to do so here; more details can be found in the links.)</p>
<p>This overlaps with the other types of VU, in that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Again, knowing about a person’s current values obviously provides a useful starting point when trying to extrapolate out from there.</li>
<li>The idealisation/extrapolation process would likely involve some improvements in beliefs and knowledge, and perhaps some of the changes that <em>actually will</em> occur for the person in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Potential ways to resolve this:</strong> This depends substantially on what we mean by the hard-to-specify terms involved. Also, it might be impossible or highly impractical to <em>actually</em> work out what values would result from the idealisation or extrapolation process, due to issues such as limited computing power.</p>
<p>But we can perhaps try to <em>approximate</em> such an idealisation or extrapolation process, or predict approximately what it <em>would</em> result in, using methods like:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Learning more</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Engaging in more moral reflection</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trying to forecast (using <a href=""https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/efforts-improve-accuracy-our-judgments-and-forecasts"">best practices</a>) what many simulations of the person would say if they’d had lots of time to learn and reflect more (see <a href=""https://www.openphilanthropy.org/2017-report-consciousness-and-moral-patienthood#AppendixA"">Muehlhauser</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thinking about what apparent “moral progress” in the past has looked like, and what changes from current values might result from similar processes of change</p>
<ul>
<li>E.g., if a person approves of the moral circle expansions that have occurred so far, perhaps we should expect that that values of the person’s idealised self would reflect an even more expanded moral circle.</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<h1>Situations that could <em>look</em> like value uncertainty</h1>
<p>I’ll now briefly discuss two other types of situations in which a person (or group) <em>actually</em> <em>isn’t</em> uncertain about their values, but could appear to be, or could even believe themselves to be.</p>
<h2>Value <em>conflict</em></h2>
<p><strong>Description/cause:</strong> Value conflict (VC) is when some or all of the values a person (or group) <em>actually has</em> are in conflict with each other. It’s like the person has multiple, competing utility functions, or different “parts of themselves” pushing them in different directions.</p>
<p>E.g., Dana is someone whose values include <em>both</em> maximising welfare <em>and</em> absolutely respecting people’s rights; it’s not simply that she’s uncertain which value she actually has deep down.</p>
<p>In <em>some</em> ways, the results of this can be the same as the results of VU (particularly <em>Present</em> VU). For this reason, the person’s situation may be misdiagnosed as VU by themselves or by others. (E.g., Dana may try to figure out which of those somewhat conflicting values she “really” has, rather than realising that she really has both.)</p>
<p><strong>Potential ways to respond:</strong> It seems unclear whether VC is a “problem”, as opposed to an acceptable result of the <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/GNnHHmm8EzePmKzPk/value-is-fragile"">fragility</a> and complexity of our value systems. It thus also seems unclear whether and how one should try to “solve” it. That said, it seems like three of the most obvious <em>options</em> for “solving” it are to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Engage in, approximate, or estimate the results of “idealisation” with regards to the conflicting values</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(Note that, if one is trying to help <em>someone else</em> “solve” <em>their</em> VC, one might instead encourage or help <em>that person</em> to use this or the following options)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use approaches similar to those meant for <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/dX7vNKg4vex5vxWCW/making-decisions-under-moral-uncertainty-1"">decision-making under moral uncertainty</a> (see also <a href=""https://kajsotala.fi/2017/08/the-parliamentary-model-as-the-correct-ethical-model/"">this</a>), except that here the person is actually certain about their values, so the “weight” given to the values is based on something like how “important” those values feel, rather than degree of belief in them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Embrace moral pluralism</p>
<ul>
<li>E.g., decide to keep as values each of the conflicting values, and just give them a certain amount of “say” or “weight” in your decision-making.</li>
<li>This may not always work, and it’s unclear how to decide on how to allocate “say” in any case.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>(Related discussion can be found in the “Moral pluralism” section of <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/oZsyK4SjnPe6HGia8/moral-uncertainty-vs-related-concepts"">this post</a>.)</p>
<p>If the goal is just to understand the person or predict their behaviours (rather than helping them to “resolve” their conflict), then one might instead think about, model, or simulate what <em>would</em> happen <em>if</em> the person used one or more of the above options.</p>
<h2><em>Merely professed</em> VU (or VC)</h2>
<p><strong>Description/cause:</strong> Merely professed VU (or merely professed VC) is when a person <em>claims</em> to be uncertain about their values (or to have multiple, conflicting values), despite this not being the case. They may do this for game-theoretic, signalling, or bargaining reasons.</p>
<p>An example of merely professed <em>VU</em>: Eric is certain about his values, and really wants to influence you to have similar values. But he also thinks that, if you believe that he’s uncertain and open to changing his mind, you’ll be more open to talking about values with him and to changing <em>your</em> mind. Thus, he feigns VU.</p>
<p>An example of merely professed <em>VC</em>: Fatma actually knows that she values only her own wellbeing, but she wishes to gain resources from altruists. To do so, she claims that there’s “part of her” that values benefiting only herself, and “another part of her” that values helping others.</p>
<p>(<em>Perhaps</em> this sort of thing could also play out on an unconscious level, so that <em>the person themselves</em> genuinely believes that they have VU or VC. But then it seems hard to disentangle this from <em>actual</em> VU or VC.)</p>
<p><strong>Potential ways to respond:</strong> I haven’t thought much about this, and I think how to respond would depend a lot on what one wishes the responses to achieve and on the specific situation. It seems like often one should respond in the same ways that are generally useful when someone may be lying to you or trying to manipulate you.</p>
<h1>Who and what are these ideas useful for?</h1>
<h2>Antirealists and/or subjectivists</h2>
<p>As noted in the introduction, one purpose of this post is to explicitly discuss the ways in which (something like) moral uncertainty is relevant for <strong>moral</strong> <strong>antirealists</strong> and/or <strong>subjectivists</strong>.</p>
<p>Roughly speaking (see <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-anti-realism/"">Joyce</a> for details), a moral antirealist is someone who accepts one of the three following claims:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Noncognitivism</strong>: The position that moral sentences are neither true nor false; they are not beliefs or factual claims. For example, moral sentences might express one’s emotions (e.g., “Murder is bad” might mean something like “Murder - boo!”).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Error theory</strong>: The position that moral sentences are <em>meant to be</em> beliefs or factual claims, but are just never true, as there are simply no moral facts. Error theory is similar to “nihilism”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Subjectivism</strong> (or <strong>non-objectivism</strong>): “moral facts exist and are mind-dependent (in the relevant sense)” (<a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-anti-realism/"">Joyce</a>). In other words, moral claims <em>can</em> be true, but their truth or falsity depends on someone’s judgement, rather than being simply an objective fact about the universe.</p>
<ul>
<li>A moral subjectivist <em>may</em> be a <strong>moral relativist</strong>; e.g., they could believe that what’s morally true for me could be different from what’s morally true for you. But they don’t <em>have</em> to be a relativist; e.g., they could believe that the same things are morally true for everyone, but that moral truth depends on one particular person’s judgement, or on the judgement of an “ideal observer”.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>(In contrast, a <strong>moral realist</strong> is someone who rejects all three of those claims. Thus, moral realists believe that moral sentences <em>do</em> (at least sometimes) reflect beliefs or factual claims, that they <em>can</em> sometimes be true, and that their truth or falsity <em>is</em> objective.<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-MxPMzRNX8kkkR7fNH-6"" id=""fnref-MxPMzRNX8kkkR7fNH-6"">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Of these types of antirealism, VU (and VC) is most clearly relevant in the case of subjectivism. For example, many subjectivists think that <em>their own values</em> (or their future or idealised values) are at least part of what determines the truth or falsity of moral claims. For these people, resolving uncertainty about their own values should seem very important. Other subjectivists may want to resolve uncertainty about the present, future, or idealised values of their society, of humanity as a whole, of all intelligent life, or something else like that (depending on what they think determines moral truth).</p>
<p>It’s less clear what special relevance VU would have for noncognitivists or error theorists (ignoring the argument that they should be metaethically uncertain about those positions). That said:</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s possible that all work on moral uncertainty should be meaningful to at least some types of noncognitivists (see <a href=""https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11098-011-9713-6"">Sepielli</a>, though see <a href=""http://jesp.org/PDF/against_the_being.pdf"">Bykvist and Olson</a> for counterarguments).</li>
<li>Resolving VU should be important to people who reject the idea of subjective <em>morality</em>, as long as they accept that the existence of <em>some</em> form of normativity (see <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/dXT5G9xEAddac8H2J/morality-vs-related-concepts"">my earlier post</a> for discussion of the overlaps and distinctions between morality, normativity, and related concepts).</li>
<li>My impression is that most “antirealists” in the LessWrong and EA communities are either moral subjectivists or at least accept the existence of <em>some</em> form of normativity (see <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/GqTeChFnXdJzDzbMd/realism-and-rationality-2"">bmgarfinkel</a> for somewhat relevant discussion)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Moral realists</h2>
<p>For moral realists, standard work on moral uncertainty is already clearly relevant. That said, VU still has additional relevance even for moral realists, because:</p>
<ul>
<li>For most plausible moral theories, making things go better according to (some) conscious beings’ values is morally good. In that case, resolving VUs would help you do morally good things.</li>
<li>Moral philosophy (whether realist-leaning or not) very often uses intuitions about moral matters as pivotal data when trying to work out what’s morally correct. Thus, it <em>could</em> be argued that progress in resolving VUs would lead to better moral theories (and thus better behaviours), even by moral realists’ lights.</li>
<li>In order to do morally good things, it will often be useful to be able to predict the <em>behaviours</em> of oneself (e.g., should I donate now in case my <a href=""https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/EMKf4Gyee7BsY2RP8/michaela-s-shortform?commentId=a3dN6Mehzzipyu5sg"">values drift</a>?) and of others. As values influence behaviours, resolving VU helps you make such predictions.</li>
<li>Some moral realists may also believe that there’s room for <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/dXT5G9xEAddac8H2J/morality-vs-related-concepts#comments"">prudential</a> (self-interested, non-moral) “should”s, and may therefore want to understand their own values so that they can more effectively do what’s “prudentially right”.</li>
</ul>
<h2>AI alignment</h2>
<p>Ideally, we want our AIs to act in accordance with what we truly value (or what we’d value after some process of idealisation or CEV). Depending on definitions, this may be seen as the core of AI alignment, as one important part of AI alignment, or as at least a nice bonus (e.g., if we use <a href=""https://ai-alignment.com/clarifying-ai-alignment-cec47cd69dd6"">Paul Christiano’s definition</a>).</p>
<p>As such, recognising and resolving VUs (and VCs) seems of very clear relevance to AI alignment work. This seems somewhat evidenced by how many VU-related ideas I found in previous alignment-related work (e.g., <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/4dHMdK5TLN6xcqtyc"">value learning</a>, inverse reinforcement learning, <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CSEdLLEkap2pubjof/research-agenda-v0-9-synthesising-a-human-s-preferences-into-1"">Stuart Armstrong’s research agenda</a>, and CEV). Indeed, a major reason why I’m interested in the topic of VU is its relevance to AI alignment, and I hope that this post can provide useful concepts and framings for others who are also interested in AI alignment.</p>
<p><em>As mentioned earlier, please do comment if you think there are better categorisations/framings for this topic, better names, additional types worth mentioning, mistakes I’ve made, or whatever.</em></p>

<li id=""fn-MxPMzRNX8kkkR7fNH-1"" class=""footnote-item""><p>Firstly, even someone “convinced” by antirealism and/or subjectivism probably shouldn’t be <em>certain</em> about those positions. Thus, such people should probably act as if <em>metaethically</em> uncertain, and that requires concepts and responses somewhat similar to those discussed in existing work on moral uncertainty. (See <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/4NFwxwzLzpiikfkk3/p/oZsyK4SjnPe6HGia8"">this post’s</a> section on “Metaethical uncertainty”.)</p>
<p>Relevantly, <a href=""http://www.williammacaskill.com/s/MacAskill-Normative-Uncertainty-tnps.pdf"">MacAskill</a> writes: “even if one endorsed a meta-ethical view that is inconsistent with the idea that there’s value in gaining more moral information, one should not be certain in that meta-ethical view. And it’s high-stakes whether that view is true — if there are moral facts out there but one thinks there aren’t, that’s a big deal! Even for this sort of antirealist, then, there’s therefore value in moral information, because there’s value in finding out for certain whether that meta-ethical view is correct.”</p>
<p>Secondly, a lot of existing work on moral uncertainty isn’t (explicitly) premised on moral realism.</p>
<p>Thirdly, in practice, many similar concepts and principles will be useful for:</p>
<ul>
<li>a moral realist who wants to act in accordance with what’s “truly right”, but who doesn’t know what that is</li>
<li>an antirealist or subjectivist who wants to act in accordance with their “fundamental” or “idealised” values, but who doesn’t know what those are.</li>
</ul>
<p>(This third point has been discussed by, for example, <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/FQKjY563bJqDeaEDr/to-first-order-moral-realism-and-moral-anti-realism-are-the"">Stuart Armstrong</a>.) <a href=""#fnref-MxPMzRNX8kkkR7fNH-1"" class=""footnote-backref"">↩︎</a></p>

This is because any of these could provide data about underlying values. So some examples of what I’d count as “behaviours” include:</p>
<ul>
<li>going for a run</li>

But the next type of VU (Predictive VU) does incorporate uncertainty about what a person’s values <em>will be</em> after the changes that <em>will occur</em> to their knowledge or beliefs (whether or not these changes are improvements). <a href=""#fnref-MxPMzRNX8kkkR7fNH-3"" class=""footnote-backref"">↩︎</a></p>

<li id=""fn-MxPMzRNX8kkkR7fNH-5"" class=""footnote-item""><p>One could argue that it doesn’t make sense to talk of “a person’s values changing”. Such arguments could be based on the idea that an “agent” is partly defined by its values (or utility function, or whatever), or the idea that people don’t fundamentally retain the “same identity” over time anyway. For this post, I wish to mostly set aside such complexities, and lean instead on the fact that it’s often <em>useful</em> to think and speak <em>as if</em> “the same person” persists over time (and even despite partial changes in values).</p>
<p>But I do think those complexities are worth acknowledging. One reason is that they can remind us to not take it for granted that a person will or should currently care about “their future self’s values” (or “their future self’s” ability to act on their values). This applies especially if the person <em>doesn’t</em> see any reason to care about <em>other people’s</em> values (or abilities to achieve their values). <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20150909120029/http://www.ruairidonnelly.com/moral-uncertainty/"">Ruairi Donnelly</a> discusses similar points, and links this to the concept of <a href=""https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/EMKf4Gyee7BsY2RP8/michaela-s-shortform?commentId=a3dN6Mehzzipyu5sg""><em>value drift</em></a>.</p>

The only thing I have found that looks like a <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/natural-kinds/"">natural kind</a> (viz. <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/esRZaPXSHgWzyB2NL/where-to-draw-the-boundaries"">a model that cuts reality at its joints</a>) is <strong><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ALvnz3DrjHwmLG29F/values-valence-and-alignment"">valence</a></strong>.</p><p><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Nfizy2uRNkZmX3AYB/preference-synthesis-illustrated-star-wars#DJvW23JsiGQSiFfq7"">Valence on its own doesn&apos;t fully explain</a> all the phenomena we want to categorize as values, especially things like <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ic8yoGBMYLtaJkbxZ/conditional-meta-preferences"">meta-preferences</a> or &quot;idealized&quot; values that are abstracted away from the concrete, <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/p7x32SEt43ZMC9r7r/embedded-agents"">embedded</a> process of a human making a choice at a point in time.

And decisions are not themselves preferences, because decisions are embedded actions taken by <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/qdqYrcGZTh9Lp49Nj/creating-environments-to-design-and-test-embedded-agents"">an agent in an environment</a> whereas preferences are, as typically considered, generators of decisions. I think we need to flip this notion of preferences as generators on its head, and in so doing we move towards becoming less confused about preferences.</p><p>So let me describe my current model of how this works, and let&apos;s see if it explains the world we find ourselves in any better than existing theories of values and preferences.</p><h1>The New Model Axiology</h1><p><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/WJzsTmsDctYCCyMfy/humans-are-embedded-agents-too"">Humans are embedded agents</a>. They carry out processes that result in them causing events. We call this process of an agent causing events <strong>acting</strong> and the process that leads to taking one action rather than any other possible action a <strong>decision</strong>. Although I believe valence describes much of how humans decide what actions to take, we need not consider that detail here and instead consider the abstraction of a <strong>decision generation process</strong> that is, importantly, inseparable from its implementation up to the limit of <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/functionalism/"">functional</a> equivalence and <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/uHb2LDW3LGhBMyq74/preference-conditional-on-circumstances-and-past-preference"">conditioned on</a> the causal history of the agent. Another way to say this is that the algorithm that makes the decision can be reasoned about and modeled but there is no simplification of the algorithm that produces exactly the same result in all cases unless it is a functionally equivalent algorithm and the decision is situated in time such that it cannot be separated from its embedding in the environment (which includes the entire past of the universe).</p><p><em>NB</em>:<em> I think there are a lot of interesting things to say about how the decision generation process seems to work in humans&#x2014;how it comes up with the set of choices it chooses between, how it makes that choice, how it is modified, etc.&#x2014;however I am going to leave off considerations of that for now so we can consider the theory at a more abstract level without getting bogged down in the implementation details of one of the gears.</em></p><p><em>Additionally, all of this is described in terms of things like agents that don&apos;t exist until they are <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/wvAEHzE55K7vfsXWz/introduction-to-noematology"">reified into existence</a>: prior to that reification into ontology all we have is <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/M7Z5sm6KoukNpF3SD/form-and-feedback-in-phenomenology"">stuff happening</a>. Let&apos;s try not to get hung up on things like where to draw the boundary of an agent right now and treat the base concepts in this model as useful handles for bootstrapping understanding of a model that I expect can be reduced.</em></p><p><strong>Preferences</strong> are then statistical regularities (probability distributions) over decisions. Importantly they come causally after decisions. Consequently preferences may predict decisions but they don&apos;t generate them. <strong>Meta-preferences</strong> are then probability distributions over preferences. Values, aesthetics, axiology, etc. are abstractions for talking about this category of probability distributions over decisions (and decisions about decisions, etc.).</p><p>Here&apos;s a pictorial representation of the model if that helps make it clearer:</p><span><figure><img src=""https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vTLiZGRahzO8ojiZ8d_JqQ1d0cHTgbyQQSyCz_vur1C0roIYbznrESS26-eGluQvJ2ULIceTcW6ullR/pub?w=1440&amp;h=1080"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:40%""></figure></span><p>This is as opposed to the standard or &quot;old&quot; model where preferences are the decision generators, which I&apos;ll stylize thusly, keeping in mind there&apos;s a lot of variation in how these &quot;old&quot; models work that I&apos;m glossing over:</p><span><figure><img src=""https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vQOTkaqNr63VJWR8aSMQ6NlJIwDeL4qXmZGpy3YSfIbefNhcKgIYdwn1LOwED4Lr7QXaXMMQtsM9GcR/pub?w=1440&amp;h=1080"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:40%""></figure></span><p>Note that in the new model preferences can still end up causally prior to decisions to the extent that they are discerned by an agent as features of their environment, but this is different from saying that preferences or meta-preferences are primary to the decision generation process. Thus when I say that preferences are causal postcedents of decisions I mean that if an agent did not know about or otherwise &quot;have&quot; preferences they would still make decisions by the decision generation process.</p><p>Although backwards from the <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/preferences/"">standard model</a>, this should not be too surprising since all animals manage to make decisions regardless of how aware they are of themselves or their actions, thus we should expect our model of values to function in the absence of decision generating preferences. Nonetheless, my guess is that this knowledge of preferences, especially knowledge of meta-preferences, feels like knowledge of the decision generation process from the inside and provides an important clue in understanding how humans might come to develop fixed points in their decision generation processes even if it really is all just valence calculations and why humans have grasped on the idea that preferences are a good model for the decision generation process.</p><p>You might object that I&apos;ve just rearranged the terms or that this is just a more detailed model of revealed preferences, and to some extent those things are true, but I also think I&apos;ve done it in a way that pulls apart concepts that were previously confounded such that we get something more useful for addressing AI alignment, which we&apos;ll explore in more detail now.</p><h1>Implications and Considerations</h1><h2>Confounded Notions of Preferences</h2><p>When we think of preferences as the generators of decisions, we run into all sorts of confusions. For example, if we equate preferences with revealed preferences people object that their revealed preferences leave something out about the process that generated their behavior and that generalizing from their observed behavior might not work as they would expect it to when applied to novel situations. This appears to be a general problem with <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/4dHMdK5TLN6xcqtyc"">most attempts</a> at having computers learn human values today: they conflate behavior with the generators of behavior, find the generators <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/cnjWN4mzmWzggRnCJ/practical-consequences-of-impossibility-of-value-learning"">only by making normative assumptions</a>, and then <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/4dHMdK5TLN6xcqtyc/p/ANupXf8XfZo2EJxGv"">end up</a> with something <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/4dHMdK5TLN6xcqtyc/p/gnvrixhDfG7S2TpNL"">that almost</a> but <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/4dHMdK5TLN6xcqtyc/p/cnC2RMWEGiGpJv8go"">doesn&apos;t quite</a> match the generator.</p><p>But if we don&apos;t pay attention to revealed preferences we are also misled about people&apos;s preferences, since, for example, what people claim to be their preferences (their stated preferences) also don&apos;t seem to do a very good job of predicting their behavior. Maybe that&apos;s because people incorrectly assume their <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CiB3myyeEhFRgmKPL/partial-preferences-and-models"">partial preferences</a> are &quot;full&quot; preferences in a total order and <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/XmqqkfY8XAJ6LkwdP/akrasia-is-confusion-about-what-you-want"">may be related</a> to <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/JTFQDdMmGC8NhQzHH/scope-insensitivity-judo"">scope insensitivity</a>; maybe it&apos;s because people are <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/BgBrXpByCSmCLjpwr/book-review-the-elephant-in-the-brain"">deceiving themselves</a> about their preferences for various reasons. Whatever the reason, stated preferences and revealed preferences both result in models with errors more than large enough for them to <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NqQxTn5MKEYhSnbuB/goodhart-s-curse-and-limitations-on-ai-alignment"">fall apart under superintelligent optimization</a>.</p><p>Another problem, much commented upon by me at least, with treating preferences as generators of decisions is that this places the descriptive strength of preferences at odds with the normative demands we would like to place on preferences. For example, there&apos;s a lot to recommend rational preferences and preferences that can be described by a utility function, so people have put a lot of work into trying to find ways that these might also explain observed human behavior, even if it&apos;s to consider human behavior degraded from an ideal that it might approach if only we thought longer, knew more, etc.. But if we can create some space between the process of making decisions and the pattern of decisions made in our models this would ease much of that tension in terms of our models&apos; abilities to explain relation and serve our purposes.</p><p>Perhaps the solution lies at some synthesis of stated and revealed preferences, but that looks to me like trying to patch a broken system or put lipstick on a pig, and at the end of the day such a model may work a little better by papering over the faults of the two submodels but will also be a <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/XAFQkbe6c9TRts6Ex/what-value-epicycles"">kludge of epicycles that will crack if a comet comes screaming through</a>. Alternatively we could look for some other method of identifying preferences, like brain scans, but at this point I think we are just arguing terminology. I could probably be convinced that calling the decision generation process &quot;preferences&quot; has some strong value, but from where I stand now it seems to cause more confusion than it resolves, so I&apos;d rather see preferences treated solely as causally after decisions and talk some other way about whatever is causally before. </p><h2>How It Helps</h2><p>What are the consequences of understanding preferences as causally downstream of actions rather than causally upstream of them? And does it make any difference since we still have something&#x2014;the decision generation process&#x2014;doing the work that we previously asked preferences, perhaps or perhaps not modeled with a utility function, to do? In other words, how does this model help us?</p><p>One of the big things it does is clear up confused thinking from getting the causal relationship between decision generation and preferences backwards. Rather than trying ever harder to find a theory that serves the two masters of accurately describing human behavior and obeying mathematical criteria that make our models behave in useful ways, we can let them operate independently. Yes, we may still want to, for example, modify human behavior to match norms, such as by increasing the rationality of human preferences, but also understand that the change doesn&apos;t come from changing preferences directly, but from changing decision generation processes such that, as a consequence, preferences are changed. And we may still want to design machines aligned with human values, but understand that aligning a machine with human preferences is not the same thing as aligning a machine with human decision generation processes since only the latter stands to capture all that humans value.</p><p>Another advantage of this model is that it is more explicitly embedded in the world. Preferences are intentionally an abstraction away from many of the messy details of how decisions are made, but as a result they lose some of their grip on reality. Said another way, preferences are a leaky <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/wuJpYLcMEBz4kcgAn/what-is-abstraction-1"">abstraction</a>, and while they may be adequate for addressing questions in microeconomics, they seem inadequate for helping us build aligned AI. <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/KJ9MFBPwXGwNpadf2/skill-the-map-is-not-the-territory"">There is no leakless abstraction</a>, but by realizing that preferences are higher up the abstraction stack and thus more leaky we can realize the need to <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/nEBbw2Bc2CnN2RMxy/gears-level-models-are-capital-investments"">go down the stack and get nearer the territory</a> to find a model with <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/B7P97C27rvHPz3s9B/gears-in-understanding"">more gears</a> that <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/3up8XBeGGHf77sNR4/the-map-has-gears-they-don-t-always-turn"">better captures what matters</a>, maybe even up to a limit where superintelligent optimization is no longer a threat but an opportunity.</p><p>In short I think the main thing this new model does is free us from the constrictions of trying to make the preference model work with humans and accounts for the embeddedness of humans. It still doesn&apos;t say enough about how decisions are generated, but it gives us a better shaped model into which an abstraction of the implementation details can be slotted than the old model provided.</p><h1>Next Steps</h1><p>I feel like what I have described in this post is only one aspect of the model that is slowly coalescing in my mind, and it is able to crystalize into something communicable only by having germs to form around provided by interacting with others. So, what have I missed, or what would you like to know that would test this theory/reframing? What, if it were true, would invalidate it? I&apos;d love to know!</p>",gworley,gordon-seidoh-worley,Gordon Seidoh Worley,

Powerful AI systems will not have their resources stolen from them, which by various dutch book theorems implies that they must be expected utility maximizers; since expected utility maximizers are goal-directed, they are dangerous.</p><p>However, the VNM theorem <u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/4dHMdK5TLN6xcqtyc/p/NxF5G6CJiof6cemTw"">does not justify</a></u> the assumption that an AI system will be goal-directed: such an assumption is really based on intuitions and conceptual arguments (which are still quite strong).</p><p><u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/x3fNwSe5aWZb5yXEG/reframing-superintelligence-comprehensive-ai-services-as"">Comprehensive AI Services</a></u> (CAIS) challenges the assumption that we will have a single agentic AI, instead suggesting that any task will be performed by a collection of modular services.</p><p>That being said, there are several other arguments for AI risk, such as the <u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/w6d7XBCegc96kz4n3/the-argument-from-philosophical-difficulty"">argument</a></u> that AI might cause &#x201C;lock in&#x201D; which may require us to solve hard philosophical problems before the development of AGI.</p><p>Nonetheless, there are <u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/QknPz9JQTQpGdaWDp/an-80-why-ai-risk-might-be-solved-without-additional"">disjunctive reasons</a></u> to expect that catastrophe does not occur: for example, there may not be a problem, or ML researchers may solve the problem after we get &#x201C;warning shots&#x201D;, or we could coordinate to not build unaligned AI.</p><p><strong>Agency and optimization.</strong> One proposed problem is that of <u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/r9tYkB2a8Fp4DN8yB"">mesa optimization</a></u>, in which an optimization algorithm used to train an AI creates an agent that is <em>itself</em> performing optimization. In such a scenario, we need to ensure that the &#x201C;inner&#x201D; optimization is also aligned.</p><p>To better understand these and other situations, it would be useful to have a formalization of optimization. This is <u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/26eupx3Byc8swRS7f/bottle-caps-aren-t-optimisers"">hard</a></u>: while we don&#x2019;t want optimization to be about our beliefs about a system, if we try to define it mechanistically, it becomes hard to avoid defining a bottle cap as an optimizer of &#x201C;water kept in the bottle&#x201D;.</p><p>Understanding agents is another hard task. While agents are relatively well understood under the Cartesian assumption, where the agent is separate from its environment, things become much more complex and poorly-understood when the agent is a <u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/Rm6oQRJJmhGCcLvxh"">part of its environment</a></u>.</p><p><strong>Value learning.</strong> Building an AI that learns all of human value has historically been thought to be very hard, because it requires you to decompose human behavior into the &#x201C;beliefs and planning&#x201D; part and the &#x201C;values&#x201D; part, and there&#x2019;s no clear way to do this.</p><p>Another way of looking at it is to say that value learning <u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/4dHMdK5TLN6xcqtyc/p/h9DesGT3WT9u2k7Hr"">requires</a></u> a model that separates the given data into that which actually achieves the true &#x201C;values&#x201D; and that which is just &#x201C;a mistake&#x201D;, which seems hard to do. In addition, value learning seems quite fragile to mis-specification of this human model.</p><p>Nonetheless, there are reasons for optimism. We could try to build an <u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/CSEdLLEkap2pubjof/research-agenda-v0-9-synthesising-a-human-s-preferences-into""><em>adequate</em> utility function</a></u>, which works well enough for our purposes. We can also have <u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/nd692YfFGfZDh9Mwz/an-69-stuart-russell-s-new-book-on-why-we-need-to-replace""><em>uncertainty</em> over the utility function</a></u>, and update the belief over time based on human behavior. If everything is specified correctly (a big if), as time goes on, the agent would become more and more aligned with human values. One major benefit of this is that it is <em>interactive</em> -- it doesn&#x2019;t require us to specify everything perfectly ahead of time.</p><p><strong>Robustness.</strong> We would like our agents to be robust - that is, they shouldn&#x2019;t fail catastrophically in situations slightly different from the ones they were designed for. Within reinforcement learning, safe reinforcement learning aims to avoid mistakes, even during training. This either requires analytical (i.e. not trial-and-error) reasoning about what a &#x201C;mistake&#x201D; is, which requires a formal specification of what a mistake is, or an overseer who can correct the agent before it makes a mistake.</p><p>The classic example of a failure of robustness is adversarial examples, in which a tiny change to an image can drastically affect its classification. Recent research has shown that these examples are <u><a href=""https://distill.pub/2019/advex-bugs-discussion/"">caused</a></u> (at least in part) by real statistical correlations that generalize to the test set, that are nonetheless fragile to small changes. In addition, since robustness to one kind of adversary doesn&#x2019;t make the classifier robust to other kinds of adversaries, there has been a lot of work done on improving adversarial evaluation in image classification. We&#x2019;re also seeing some of this work in reinforcement learning.</p><p>However, asking our agents to be robust to arbitrary mistakes seems to be too much -- humans certainly don&#x2019;t meet this bar. For AI safety, it seems like we need to ensure that our agents are robustly <u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/EmDuGeRw749sD3GKd/p/ZeE7EKHTFMBs8eMxn"">intent aligned</a></u>, that is, they are always &#x201C;trying&#x201D; to do what we want. One particular way that our agents could be intent aligned is if they are <u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/EmDuGeRw749sD3GKd/p/fkLYhTQteAu5SinAc"">corrigible</a></u>, that is, they are trying to keep us &#x201C;in control&#x201D;. This seems like a particularly easy property to verify, as conceptually it seems to be independent of the domain in which the agent is deployed.</p><p>So, we would like to ensure that even in the worst case, our agent remains corrigible. One <u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/9Dy5YRaoCxH9zuJqa/relaxed-adversarial-training-for-inner-alignment"">proposal</a></u> would be to train an adversary to search for &#x201C;relaxed&#x201D; situations in which the agent behaves incorrigibly, and then train the agent not to do that.</p><p><strong>Scaling to superhuman abilities.</strong> If we&#x2019;re building corrigible agents using adversarial training, our adversary should be more capable than the agent that it is training, so that it can find all the situations in which the agent behaves incorrigibly. This requires techniques that scale to superhuman abilities. Some techniques for this include <u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/EmDuGeRw749sD3GKd"">iterated amplification</a></u> and <u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00899"">debate</a></u>.</p><p>In iterated amplification, we start with an initial policy, and alternate between amplification and distillation, which increase capabilities and efficiency respectively. This can encode a range of algorithms, but often amplification is done by decomposing questions and using the agent to answer subquestions, and distillation can be done using supervised learning or reinforcement learning.</p><p>In debate, we train an agent through self-play in a zero-sum game in which the agent&#x2019;s goal is to &#x201C;win&#x201D; a question-answering debate, as evaluated by a human judge. The hope is that since each &#x201C;side&#x201D; of the debate can point out flaws in the other side&#x2019;s arguments, such a setup can use a human judge to train far more capable agents while still incentivizing them to provide honest, true information.</p><p>Both iterated amplification and debate aim to train an agent that approximates the answer that one would get from an exponentially large tree of humans deliberating. The <u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/EmDuGeRw749sD3GKd/p/DFkGStzvj3jgXibFG"">factored cognition</a></u> hypothesis is that this sort of tree of humans is able to do any task we care about. This hypothesis is controversial: many have the intuition that cognition requires large contexts and flashes of intuition that couldn&#x2019;t be replicated by a tree of time-limited humans.</p><p><strong>Universality.</strong> One <u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/M8WdeNWacMrmorNdd/towards-formalizing-universality"">property</a></u> we would hope to have is that if we use this tree of humans as an overseer for some simpler agent, then the tree would &#x201C;know everything the agent knows&#x201D;. If true, this property could allow us to build a significantly stronger conceptual argument for safety. It is also very related to&#x2026;</p><p><strong>Interpretability.</strong> While interpretability can help us know what the agent knows, and what the agent would do in other situations (which can help us verify if it is corrigible), there are <u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/X2i9dQQK3gETCyqh2/chris-olah-s-views-on-agi-safety"">other uses</a></u> for it as well: in general, it seems better if we can understand the things we&#x2019;re building.</p><p><strong>Impact regularization.</strong> While relative reachability and attainable utility preservation were developed last year, this year saw them be <u><a href=""https://medium.com/@deepmindsafetyresearch/designing-agent-incentives-to-avoid-side-effects-e1ac80ea6107"">unified</a></u> into a single framework. In addition, there was a new proposed <u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/7CdoznhJaLEKHwvJW"">definition</a></u> of impact: change in our ability to get what we want. This notion of impact depends on knowing the utility function U. However, we might hope that we can penalize some &#x201C;objective&#x201D; notion, perhaps &quot;power&quot;, that occurs regardless of the choice of U, for the same reasons that we expect instrumental convergence.</p><p><strong>Causal modeling.</strong> Causal models have been used recently to <u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08663"">model</a></u> the incentives for an agent under different AI safety frameworks, and to <u><a href=""https://medium.com/@deepmindsafetyresearch/designing-agent-incentives-to-avoid-reward-tampering-4380c1bb6cd"">argue</a></u> that by evaluating plans with the current reward function, you can remove the incentive for an agent to tamper with its reward function.</p><p><strong>Oracles.</strong> Even if oracles are trying to maximize predictive accuracy, they could &#x201C;choose&#x201D; between different self-confirming predictions. We could avoid this using counterfactual oracles, which make predictions conditioning that their predictions do not influence the future.</p><p><strong>Decision theory.</strong> There was work on decision theory, that I haven&#x2019;t followed very much.</p><p><strong>Forecasting.</strong> Several resources were developed to enable effective group forecasting, including an <u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/8y7DcSF4eAkXoru4u/ai-forecasting-dictionary-forecasting-infrastructure-part-1-2"">AI forecasting dictionary</a></u> that defines terms, an <u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/9G6CCNXkA7JZoorpY/ai-forecasting-resolution-council-forecasting-infrastructure"">AI resolution council</a></u> whose future opinions can be predicted, and a dataset of well-constructed <u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/yy3FCmdAbgSLePD7H/how-to-write-good-ai-forecasting-questions-question-database"">exemplar questions</a></u> about AI.</p><p>Separately, the debate over takeoff speeds continued, with <u><a href=""https://sideways-view.com/2018/02/24/takeoff-speeds/"">two</a></u> <u><a href=""https://aiimpacts.org/likelihood-of-discontinuous-progress-around-the-development-of-agi/"">posts</a></u> arguing forcefully for continuous takeoff, <u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/PzAnWgqvfESgQEvdg/any-rebuttals-of-christiano-and-ai-impacts-on-takeoff-speeds"">without much response</a></u> (although many researchers do not agree with them). The continuity of takeoff is relevant for but doesn&#x2019;t completely determine whether recursive self improvement will happen, or whether some actor acquires a decisive strategic advantage. The primary implication of the debate is whether we should expect that we will have enough time to react and fix problems as they arise.</p><p>It has also become clearer that recent progress in AI has been driven to a significant degree by increasing the <u><a href=""https://openai.com/blog/ai-and-compute/"">amount of compute</a></u> devoted to AI, which suggests a more continuous takeoff. You could take the position that current methods can&#x2019;t do &lt;property X&gt; (say, causal reasoning), and so it doesn&#x2019;t matter how much compute you use.</p><p><strong>AI Progress.</strong> There was a lot of progress in AI.</p><p><strong>Field building.</strong> There were posts aiming to build the field, but they were all fairly disjointed.</p>",rohinmshah,rohinmshah,Rohin Shah,

There will be charts, and memes, and dating stories.</p><h2>Woke Women, Dangerous Men</h2><p>The immediate&#xA0;<em>trigger</em> for this post is the recent article about <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/2020/01/9244509/laurence-fox-anti-woke-meaning"">The Dangerous Rise Of Men Who Won&#x2019;t Date &#x201C;Woke&#x201D; Women</a></em> by Vicky Spratt. The article lists the signs by which ye shall know them: men who list &#x201C;no psychos&#x201D; as a requirement on their dating profiles, this one guy who described Jordan Peterson as his &#x201C;dream dinner guest&#x201D;. But a few paragraphs later, Ms. Spratt is talking about MAGA, 8chan, and mass shooters.</p><span><figure><img src=""https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/well-that-escalated-quickly.png"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:81%""></figure></span><p>I know quite a few guys who are terrified of dating woke women. Let me paint you a picture: nerd, works in tech or journalism, voted for Hillary and is now debating between Bernie and Yang, hooked up with a trans woman once, thinks that Sam Harris pwned Peterson because religion is dumb, asks for verbal consent before kissing on the first date. Not quite the stereotypical right-winger. The real right-wingers can barely distinguish between the &#x201C;woke&#x201D; and the moderate liberals. They instead complain that all women are brainwashed by &#x201C;<a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/new_right/wiki/neoreaction#wiki_the_cathedral"">The Cathedral</a>&#x201D; into refusing to date <span style=""text-decoration:line-through"">conservative</span> real men. Basically, it&#x2019;s the same article but with the signs flipped.</p><p>My friend Holly <a href=""https://twitter.com/Ilex_ulmus/status/1220369368871264256"">reasonably asked</a>: why don&#x2019;t woke women consider it a favor that dangerous far-right lunatics avoid them? And then it clicked: it&#x2019;s all about <strong>the sex ratio</strong>.</p><p>In this post, I&#x2019;ll talk only about heterosexual relationships, since sex ratio dynamics don&#x2019;t affect gay people in this way. I will also treat gender and sex more or less interchangeably and as a binary because that&#x2019;s what all the research on politics and sex ratios does. Also, because it makes the math easier. I&#x2019;ll focus on the US and UK because those are the societies with whose political tribes I&#x2019;m familiar with (although math works the same anywhere in the world).</p><p>In short: if you feel that this post is a mathematical abstraction that doesn&#x2019;t represent your lived experience, you&#x2019;re absolutely right. Sorry. No need to spam the comments.</p><h2>Markets and the Ratio</h2><p>A mating market is a group of people who, among other things, are looking to <strong>mate</strong>: sleep with, date, and/or marry each other. Markets don&#x2019;t necessarily involve money; bees and flowers are in a nectar-pollination market. Markets are about matching up two or more groups who provide value to each other, one&#x2019;s supply to another&#x2019;s demand.</p><p>The mating markets of different individuals are never quite the same, but they overlap. Your city, culture, social class, hobbies, favorite subreddit, familiarity with mail-order bride websites &#x2014; they all define the set of people you are likely to meet for the purpose of mating.</p><p>Each participant in the market has a market value: how attractive they are as a partner. Attractiveness is always about more than looks. Status, intellectual traits, knowing to play the guitar, age, money &#x2014; these all affect attractiveness. Most importantly, value is defined by the market: how many people of the sex you&#x2019;re looking for are interested in what you offer, and how many of your competitors are offering the same or better. A woman with a Ph.D. is much less impressive in Boston than in Des Moines. Six-pack abs on a man are much rarer in Memphis than in Los Angeles. And it&#x2019;s not just because Angelenos are fitter. It&#x2019;s also because Angelenos are more male.</p><p>The ratio between men and women in a mating market is the most underrated force shaping mating outcomes. It&#x2019;s underrated because it&#x2019;s not directly visible except in extreme cases. But the downstream effects of a skewed ratio are very visible: one of the sexes has more choices, and thus it has a lot more power.</p><span><figure><img src=""https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/gender-balance-map.png"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:93%""></figure></span><p>There are three important aspects of how the sex ratio affects dating.</p><h4>1 &#x2013; The sex ratio affects norms around dating</h4><p>Studies ranging from <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5540856/"">19th-century Utah</a> to <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3130599/"">21st-century college campuses</a> show how populations respond to skewed sex ratios. Where there is an excess of men there is less premarital sex, men invest more in long-term relationships, women marry young and to richer husbands. Female majority leads to a culture of sexual promiscuity, fewer traditional dates (which the man pays for), fewer long-term relationships.</p><p><em>Opportunity costs</em> affect economic decisions even if the opportunity is never taken advantage of. Similarly, even people in exclusive long-term relationships feel the effects of the prevailing sex ratio on male vs. female investment and on promiscuity vs. commitment.</p><p>This doesn&#x2019;t require that all or even most people prefer the dating style stereotypical of their sex. As long as there&#x2019;s any difference in preference&#xA0;<em>on average</em>, the minority sex will get to dictate their preferences more. We&#x2019;ll get back to this important point when discussing age and politics.</p><h4>2 &#x2013; Skewed sex ratios breed resentment towards the minority sex</h4><p>From the <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3130599/"">college campus study</a>:</p><blockquote>Our results suggest that women on campuses where they comprise a higher proportion of the student body give more negative appraisals of campus men and relationships [&#x2026;]<br>We would expect women on campuses with higher proportions of women to report that men are less willing to commit and less likely to treat women well. This is indeed what we find. On campuses where women are more plentiful, women are more likely to agree that men are not interested in commitment and are not to be trusted. Moreover, women on these campuses expect less from the men they date, find it harder to meet the right kind of men, and do not find many attractive potential partners on campus.</blockquote><p>When women complain that &#x201C;there aren&#x2019;t enough good guys out there&#x201D;, half the issue is that <em>there are too many women</em>. The real complaint is usually &#x201C;there aren&#x2019;t enough good guys <em>for me</em>&#x201C;. Of course, the same obtains for men who complain about the deteriorating quality of women, not noticing the deteriorating sex ratio that&#x2019;s at the root of their predicament.</p><h4>3 &#x2013; Being the majority sex sucks more than being the minority rocks</h4><p>What is it like being a guy in a 45/55 mating market? (I&#x2019;ll quote all sex ratios as the ratio of men to women, so 45/55 means 45% male). In short, not much. If you&#x2019;re the median guy on some generalized attribute of attractiveness (23rd out of 45) you might match with the 23rd-most attractive woman out of 55, the 58th percentile woman instead of the 50th percentile if the ratio was balanced. It&#x2019;s not a big difference. You&#x2019;re more likely to have casual sex and be able delay commitment, but a lot of guys prefer steady partners to one night stands anyway. The same goes for women in a 55/45 market.</p><p>What is it like being a woman in a 45/55? It&#x2019;s the anxiety of knowing that you have a one-in-five chance of ultimately not finding a partner. It means fierce competition with other women for guys, which makes intra-sex friendships more fragile. It means not feeling secure in a relationship because your partner&#x2019;s <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_alternative_to_a_negotiated_agreement"">BATNA</a> is so much higher than yours. If you&#x2019;re not very attractive or <a href=""https://putanumonit.com/2017/10/11/winning-is-for-losers/#weirdo"">very idiosyncratic</a>, it&#x2019;s that much worse.</p><p>The same applies to men in a market where they are the 55% majority. It sucks.</p><p><a href=""https://putanumonit.com/2019/12/30/100-ways-to-live-better/#advice59"">Moving out of a mating market that&#x2019;s skewed against you</a> and into a balanced one is a lot more important than moving into a favorable one. As long as the ratio is not skewed against you, it&#x2019;s better to find a market of people that match. That&#x2019;s why you see a lot more advice telling single young men to GTFO of the Bay Area than advice telling young women to go west for boyfriends unless these women are particularly interested in <a href=""https://putanumonit.com/2019/10/16/polyamory-is-rational/#sf"">polyamorous nerds</a>.</p><p>Moving into a mating market where you&#x2019;re the minority is not opportunistic, it&#x2019;s altruistic. The opposite sex will be very happy to have you. Even if they don&#x2019;t personally date you, you&#x2019;re taking their competitors off the market and improving the ratio.</p><h2>Gendered Tribes</h2><p>There are <a href=""https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2018/03/06/a-quick-battle-field-guide-to-the-new-culture-wars/"">many ways to break down</a> the political and culture war landscape. A relatively comprehensive and rigorous attempt is the report <em><a href=""https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/64d44-hidden_tribes_report-2.pdf"">Hidden Tribes: A Study of America&#x2019;s Polarized Landscape</a></em> by Hawking et al which I&#x2019;ll use as my main reference point.</p><span><figure><img src=""https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/hidden-tribes-scatter.png"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:94%""></figure></span><p>Wow, the political distribution of Americans surely looks like this thing, you know, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horseshoe_theory"">the thing you put on a hoof</a>.</p><p><em>Hidden Tribes&#xA0;</em>breaks Americans into seven groups, identified by clustering their opinions on various political issues as well as their level of engagement in politics. The three liberal tribes comprise 34% of the population, and they are 55% female. The two conservative tribes comprise 25% of all Americans and are 57% male. The remainder are politically moderate or disengaged.</p><p>Within the liberal tribes, the Progressive Activists (which I identify as &#x201C;the woke&#x201D;) are younger, whiter (!), and are twice as likely to have 4-year or advanced degrees as the rest of the country.&#xA0; They are in line with Traditional and Passive Liberals on police brutality, immigration, and distaste for Donald Trump. They stand out from other liberals in their stance on male and white privilege, their attitudes about free speech and political correctness, and in their lukewarm feelings towards men.</p><p>The latter represents an important asymmetry between the far left and the right. All other tribes have more positive feelings towards both genders than the woke have towards men. Another difference is that Progressive Activists are much more likely to endorse attitudes such as <em>&#x201C;People&#x2019;s outcomes are outside their control</em>&#x201C;, 86% vs. a mere 2% of Devoted Conservatives.</p><p>Furthermore, within the Progressive Activist tribe, there are big gender gaps on gender-related issues. 19% of woke men agree that <em>&#x201C;Men and women mostly have the same chances at success&#x201D;</em> but only 1% of woke women do.</p><p>This is not a recipe for a happy dating market. And it gets even worse.</p><h2>An Age-Old Question</h2><p>It is <a href=""https://theblog.okcupid.com/the-case-for-an-older-woman-99d8cabacdf5"">a fact of dating life</a> that women prefer men around the same age as them, but men prefer younger women (on average). In fact, men&#x2019;s preferred age gap grows as they get older.</p><span><figure><img src=""https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/men-age-dating-preference.png"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:97%""></figure></span><p>Again, this is not a male universal. From high school until now, almost all the women I&#x2019;ve dated were within two years of my age on either side. On the other hand, Leonardo DiCaprio has enforced a hard cap at 25 years regardless of his own age. Even if the skew is driven by a minority of men it will still mean that women in their early twenties will experience a favorable mating market with many suitors, while women in their thirties and older will experience a mating market slightly skewed against them. At the very least, their list of potential suitors does not include Leo.</p><span><figure><img src=""https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/dicaprio-girlfriend-age.png"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:96%""></figure></span><p>As you recall, youth is correlated with wokeness. Even if they&#x2019;re the majority sex in their political tribe, young Progressive Activist women can play in a favorable dating market in their twenties. But as they get older, things begin to change.</p><span><figure><img src=""https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/woke-dating-base-ratio.png"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:95%""></figure></span><p>This is a chart of the dating market for liberal men and women. Liberals are 55% female and 45% male, which is represented on the chart by 11 women and 9 men.</p><p>In their early twenties, life is good for woke heterosexuals of both persuasions. The men have plenty of female peers to flirt with in class and at rallies. The women get plenty of attention from older men, which balances out the sex ratio.</p><span><figure><img src=""https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/woke-dating-twenties.png"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:92%""></figure></span><p>As they enter their thirties, several things start going against the women in particular.</p><ol><li>A rising number of people pair off and leave the dating market, making all imbalances more pronounced for the singles that remain.</li><li>They receive less attention from the older men who <a href=""https://www.shmoop.com/quotes/i-keep-getting-older-they-stay-the-same-age.html"">like their women to stay the same age</a>.</li><li>The age preference bites them a second time when some of the liberal men turn out to be DiCaprios themselves and switch to pursuing women in their early twenties.</li><li>More men than women transition out of the very liberal tribe, at least in their dating preference. In part, these are the men who were never as on-board with the gender politics of the Progressive Activists. And in part, because Progressive Activists are likelier to be white and educated and when white educated men hit their thirties they tend to start making good money. A rich white man may prefer to date outside of the tribe that treats &#x201C;white&#x201D;, &#x201C;man&#x201D;, and &#x201C;rich&#x201D; as synonyms for the outgroup.</li><li>Finally, there are more gay men than lesbian women and more male-to-female transsexuals than female-to-male. These are all likelier to be members of the liberal tribes. This further reduces the number of single, woke men-who-date-women available.</li></ol><p>And so the women who stay in the Progressive Activist tribe have two options: read <a href=""https://putanumonit.com/2020/01/20/bisexual-womans-guide/"">Sana&#x2019;s guide for women dating women</a>, or face a dating market that is suddenly very skewed against them.</p><span><figure><img src=""https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/woke-dating-thirties-1.png"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:99%""></figure></span><p>Ms. Spratt, the author of the article about men who don&#x2019;t date woke, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/2019/12/8692578/younger-sister-married-first-tradition"">is 31, single, and</a> <em>&#x201C;grateful to be financially independent and living in a time where it&#x2019;s acknowledged that you&#x2019;re better off on your own for a while than trapped in an unhappy relationship.&#x201D;</em> So that is the third option: going your own way while writing articles about the men who keep out of your mating market.</p><p>I hope that this doesn&#x2019;t come across as mocking. I find this genuinely sad. I strongly believe that <a href=""https://putanumonit.com/2020/01/13/go-f-someone/"">relationships are preferable to aloneness</a>. The predicament of Ms. Spratt and her fellow progressive sisters in their thirties is a result of mating market dynamics, not of unusual malice on their part. In a sad irony, the progressive tribe is the one sounding the loudest alarm bells about the negative outcomes that arise from unchecked market dynamics. Ha ha.</p><p>These dynamics are also quite independent of the merits of progressive ideology on its own. Whether the world is indeed shaped by the privileged elites oppressing the rest of humanity or not has no bearing on the numbers. But, progressive ideology does make matters worse for women because of its belief that people&#x2019;s outcomes are outside of their control. If you believe that, you will be a lot less likely to improve your situation through your own agency (such as by moving to more favorable markets). Given that the gender imbalance of the political wings is unlikely to change by itself, those who don&#x2019;t help themselves won&#x2019;t be helped by circumstance.</p><p>But wait, it gets even worse.</p><h2>Vicious Cycles</h2><p>If you recall, skewed mating markets make the majority sex resentful of the minority (quite reasonably, you may add). And a feature of the woke tribe is resentment of men: that men have an unfair advantage, that they have more power, that they exploit it for their own good.</p><p>And in the woke dating scene, this is absolutely 100% correct.</p><p>I have gone on a few dates with very progressive women who spent the entire time complaining about their mistreatment at the hands of men. And while I have real compassion for their plight, this topic isn&#x2019;t going to light a romantic spark on a first date.</p><p>And so, the vicious cycle runs:</p><ol><li>Female-skewed sex ratio, which leads to</li><li>Men having more power and taking advantage of it, which leads to</li><li>Women building resentment and complaining about men, which leads to</li><li>Men leaving the mating market for places where their sex is more welcome, which leads to</li><li>An ever more skewed mating market.</li></ol><p>This cycle is mirrored quite symmetrically on the opposite end of the gender war horseshoe. The manosphere keeps going on and on about hypergamy &#x2014; that all women are focused on the tiny sliver of guys who are hot, rich, and popular, and that the average guy is left holding his junk. This seems somewhat incongruous with all the broke, average-looking, medium-status men I see going on dates all around me.</p><p>But then I realized that the manosphere is just that, a community of mostly men. Guys who are ideologically aligned with the various flavors of the red pill are more likely to be in male-majority mating markets such as the two conservative tribes (57% male) or the libertarian gang (63%). These men may think that their dating market encompasses all political tribes, but women aren&#x2019;t stupid. Both genders have a strong nose for politics and ideology when looking for partners.</p><p>The women who choose to remain in the dating pools of red-pilled guys know that they&#x2019;re a hot commodity and can choose from the best partners. These men created hypergamy by their own efforts.</p><span><figure><img src=""https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/quit-talking-abt-hypergamy.jpg"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:97%""></figure></span><p>This also explains why politics and culture war extremists tend to espouse a view of relationships as a zero-sum power struggle.</p><p>In the politically-moderate gender-balanced middle, neither men nor women have a dim view of the other sex and neither has the power to dictate terms. <a href=""https://putanumonit.com/2017/10/11/winning-is-for-losers/"">Compromise and cooperation</a> lead to the best outcomes, in Congress and in the bedroom. But on the sex-skewed edges, the minority do what they can and the majority suffer what they must while building seething resentment. <a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/01/24/conflict-vs-mistake/"">Political conflict theory</a> turns into gender conflict theory.</p><h2>Virtue Signaling</h2><p>If you&#x2019;re a woman in a very progressive mating market or a man in a strongly conservative one, you&#x2019;re likely to care a lot about the ideological fidelity of your potential mates. This is for two reasons:</p><ol><li>People on the extremes of the horseshoe are more strongly devoted to their position. Ideology plays a bigger role in their life and makes up a larger fraction of their identity. They want a partner who matches that fervor.</li><li>They know that a partner who is less devoted to the tribe has more options &#x2014; they can always betray the cause for a cute centrist. An ideological partner has fewer options and is more reliable.</li></ol><p>What kind of man signs up for dismantling the patriarchy? What sort of woman embraces the red pill? Two types: the true believers in the creed, and those that were attracted by the generous sex ratio and the opportunities to exert mating choice power. It is very important for the true believers to tell the two apart, and the mechanism for doing so is exhaustive and exhausting virtue signaling.</p><p>In 2014 I went on a date with a teacher at a Bronx public school, an intensely progressive social environment. One drink into the evening, we had the following astonishing conversation.</p><blockquote><strong>Me:</strong> You went to Metropolitan Comedy Club? I did my first stand-up set there. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdmj6oFI-I"">It&#x2019;s quite embarrassing and also on YouTube forever</a>.<br><strong>Her:</strong> You do stand-up? Who are your top 5 comedians?<br><strong>Me:</strong> I don&#x2019;t really keep lists, but if I had to put one together it would be Nikki Glazer, Jerrod Carmichael, Chappelle, Sarah Silverman, Pete Holmes. How about you?<br><strong>Her:</strong> [Names 5 dudes].<br><strong>Me:</strong> It&#x2019;s cool that you&#x2019;re a comedy fan.<br><strong>Her:</strong> Wait, there were no women on my list!<br><strong>Me:</strong> It&#x2019;s fine, it&#x2019;s just the comedians you like. I&#x2019;m sure your favorite novelists are mostly women.<br><strong>Her:</strong> How can you say it&#x2019;s fine?! It&#x2019;s not fine! This sort of attitude is why it&#x2019;s so hard for women to be represented in comedy!!!<br><strong>Me:</strong></blockquote><span><figure><img src=""https://i.imgur.com/sohWhy9g.png"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:47%""></figure></span><p>I&#x2019;m not entirely sure what happened. Was my failure to <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519300922021"">punish defectors</a> worse than the norm-breaking itself? Was I automatically in the wrong because I&#x2019;m male? Was she just signaling her wokeness to me, lest I think that she doesn&#x2019;t sufficiently care about women&#x2019;s issues? One can imagine that in her social circles, she&#x2019;s as worried about being &#x201C;found out&#x201D; as not woke enough as she is about purity-testing men.</p><p>Interestingly, despite this catastrophic failure of virtue signaling on our part, she was quite willing to continue our romantic dalliance. Tribal politics are strong, but so is horniness.</p><h2>Choosing Sex or Sex Politics</h2><p>Emma Sulkowicz became famous as Columbia University&#x2019;s&#xA0;<em>Mattress Girl</em>, lugging a 50-pound mattress around campus to protest the university&#x2019;s mishandling of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University_rape_controversy"">her rape allegation</a>. Whatever happened that night in Sulkowicz&#x2019;s dorm room, Columbia found no evidence base to take action against the man accused by Sulkowicz and even <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2017/07/13/columbia-university-settles-title-ix-lawsuit-with-former-student-involving-mattress-girl-case/"">settled with him out of court</a> for gender discrimination.</p><span><figure><img src=""https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/mattress-columbia.png"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:78%""></figure></span><p>The&#xA0;<em>affair&#xA0;</em>put Sulkowicz in an interesting position. On one hand, an inspiration for women survivors of assault and a symbol of #BelieveAllWomen. On the other hand, a reputation that is likely quite intimidating to potential sexual partners, even of the most progressive sort.</p><p>And so, 5 years after she picked up the mattress, Sulkowicz is &#x201C;<a href=""https://www.thecut.com/2019/10/did-emma-sulkowicz-mattress-performance-get-redpilled.html"">attending house parties and happy hours with conservative and libertarian intellectuals, reading Jordan Peterson and articles from the&#xA0;</a><em><a href=""https://www.thecut.com/2019/10/did-emma-sulkowicz-mattress-performance-get-redpilled.html"">National Review.</a></em>&#x201D; She talks about the importance of understanding a variety of political attitudes, of listening with an open mind. What triggered this change in attitude? In Emma&#x2019;s own words:&#xA0;<em>&#x201C;This story starts with me being on Tinder [&#x2026;] He was very blond, law school, cut jawline, trapezoidal body figure, tweed suit kind of vibe, but something inside of me made me swipe right, I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201D;</em></p><p>Art, humor, altruism, ideology &#x2014; everything we do is guided by our psychology, and <a href=""https://www.primalpoly.com/the-mating-mind"">our psychology evolved by sexual selection</a>. And so everything we do is driven by the desire for reproduction (<a href=""https://www.nature.com/news/1-500-scientists-lift-the-lid-on-reproducibility-1.19970"">apart from actually publishing psychology papers</a>). It&#x2019;s often not the immediate cause of our actions, but it&#x2019;s always in the back of our brains and in the chains of cause and effect guiding us. <em>&#x201C;Something inside us&#x201D;</em>, as Ms. Sulkowicz says. And when our brains sense that our behavior (such as adherence to a political ideology) is costing us in the mating domain, it&#x2019;s cause for internal conflict.</p><p>Since I&#x2019;ve left business school and come to NYC, I&#x2019;ve significantly softened my stance on economic questions. I&#x2019;m a lot less dogmatic about <a href=""https://putanumonit.com/2016/07/14/the-price-is-always-right/"">free-market ideals</a>, and I see a lot to like in the <a href=""https://putanumonit.com/2018/10/10/ubi-for-president/"">economic platform of someone like Andrew Yang</a>. Did I happen to read more smart articles to my left on economics? Or did I happen to flirt with a lot of women in NYC, almost all of whom are to my left on economics? Perhaps I sat down to read those articles <em>because</em> I met those women. It&#x2019;s impossible to disentangle the two. I only have one brain that I use for both dating and thinking about economics, I bring all of it to both endeavors.</p><p>An ideologue would be horrified by someone &#x201C;betraying the cause&#x201D; for the sake of something as base as getting laid. I&#x2019;m equally horrified by people choosing an ideological stance, one that is most often <a href=""https://putanumonit.com/2019/12/30/100-ways-to-live-better/#advice74"">purely about signaling and has no impact on the world</a>, over pursuing a romantic connection.</p><p>Ideally, people find a compromise. The day I started writing this post the trending hashtag on Twitter was <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/hotgirlsforbernie"">#HotGirlsForBernie</a>. Attractive women are posting sexy selfies all over in support of a socialist candidate. Wat means?</p><span><figure><img src=""https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/emily-for-bernie.jpg"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:72%""></figure></span><p>Bernie Sanders&#x2019; main rival in the progressive wing of the Democrat Party is Elizabeth Warren. Warren leans heavily on gender and identity politics, and <a href=""https://www.businessinsider.com/democrats-candidates-poll-age-gender-race-region-politics-2019#men-and-women-view-the-race-differently-sen-amy-klobuchar-mayor-pete-buttigieg-and-sen-elizabeth-warren-do-better-among-women-while-andrew-yang-mayor-michael-bloomberg-and-sen-bernie-sanders-do-better-among-men-1"">her supporters are disproportionately female and old</a>. Sanders leans on class war and socialist economics, <a href=""https://www.businessinsider.com/democrats-candidates-poll-age-gender-race-region-politics-2019#men-and-women-view-the-race-differently-sen-amy-klobuchar-mayor-pete-buttigieg-and-sen-elizabeth-warren-do-better-among-women-while-andrew-yang-mayor-michael-bloomberg-and-sen-bernie-sanders-do-better-among-men-1"">he is the best polling candidate among the young and the male</a>.</p><p>The young liberal women, those that are interested in their own popularity among young male progressives, have taken notice. Tweeting for Bernie, name dropping Joe Rogan or Sam Harris, putting books by Camille Paglia or Jonathan Haidt on their shelves, these are the ways that young women signal <em>I&#x2019;m liberal, but I&#x2019;m not too woke to date</em>. And the brave ones admit to having watched some Jordan Peterson videos too, just out of curiosity.</p><h2>The Leftovers</h2><p>What happens to those who refuse to compromise? As a mating cohort gets older, those who are willing to relax their ideological stances for the sake of relationships pair off and leave the market. That leaves the politically obstinate, who are faced with a shrinking mating market mired in virtue signaling and a sex ratio that gets more skewed by the year. They become even more convinced that the opposite sex is using its power to oppress them, and their personal experience confirms it.</p><p>These lonely partisans are a minority of the population, but they are active in politics and media. I&#x2019;m convinced that a lot of discourse about the &#x201C;gender wars&#x201D; and polarization of men against women is driven by those at the edges of the horseshoe, especially as they leave their twenties behind. In the exhausted moderate majority, men and women seem to be getting along just fine.</p><p>And so let us get back to the original question: why is Vicky Spratt complaining about the men who don&#x2019;t date woke if she despises them so much? Because every man who forswears woke women is one fewer man to take a female competitor off the dating market, one fewer opportunity to balance the ratio. It&#x2019;s one fewer lifeline that would allow Ms. Spratt to keep her ideology <em>and</em> her mating value without sacrificing either.</p><p>The real article should have been called <em>&#x201C;The Dangerous Decrease in Moderately Liberal Men Who Are Willing to Date My Woke Friends Who Compete With Me for the Last Few Single Woke Guys in Their Thirties&#x201D;</em>. Perhaps Ms. Spratt is not the woman to write it if she is genuinely happy with her political convictions and romantic situation. In any case, the original magazine is certainly not the venue to publish it &#x2014; one-sided polemics sell more ads that discussions of real, painful trade-offs.</p><p>But I don&#x2019;t have ads to sell or ideologies to promote, I just do math and <a href=""https://putanumonit.com/meet/"">go on dates</a>. I certainly recommend it.</p>",Jacobian,jacob-falkovich,Jacob Falkovich,

This post takes that assumption as its premise. My case for it has already been made previously.</p><p>Some items on this list are political interventions. They require solving the collective action and <a href=""http://Acknowledgements  I would like to thank Ben Hoffman, Sarah Constantin and Michael Vassar for providing the impetus to read Moral Mazes and take it seriously. It takes a lot of motivation to get through a book that heavy.  I would like to thank Ben Hoffman, Michael Vassar, Raymond Arnold, Ben Pace, Oliver Habyrka, Zack Davis, Jessica Taylor and my wife Laura Baur for helping me edit the sequence. Without strong editorial feedback, this sequence would likely not have come to be, and if it did it would have been much weaker.  Ben Hoffman in particular was vital early on in helping me wrap my head around the problem, Michael Vassar later on for making sure I didn't miss the important points, and Raymond Arnold for making sure what I wrote would have a fighting chance of being understood. Many thanks.  I'd also like to thank the commentators, including the ones who made comments I found frustrating and wrong, but especially the ones who challenged me in ways that improved my thinking.  And also those that helped keep up morale so I could finish. Engagement matters, and knowing you have people you respect interested matters too. Little notes of appreciation can go a long way. It's important to give praise. This includes Scott Alexander, and also Robin Hanson, who said he would read Moral Mazes on the strength of the quotes I provided. I look forward to seeing both their takes.  I'd also like to thank the person who got How to Identify an Immoral Maze to be featured on Hacker News. The&nbsp;majority&nbsp;of hits I get come from being featured somewhere, in one form of another. I do my best not to let that change what I write."">public choice</a> problems of writing and passing good versions of the appropriate laws and regulations.&nbsp;</p><p>Some of these items are cultural shifts that happen one person at a time. This is a different kind of collective action problem.

They are not full justifications for dismissing potential solutions.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, there is one last solution that asks what one determined person or organization with extensive resources might do, and comes back with the answer of quite a bit. That will be the next post.&nbsp;</p><p>As a reminder, I am not, except where explicitly saying so, endorsing the political proposals as good ideas or rejecting them as bad ones. Nor am I interested in having political policy debates, or any other political debates, on the internet – any comments along these lines will be ignored at best and deleted at worst. I am only saying these actions might help with the problem of mazes, without being <i>obviously</i> catastrophic.</p><p>This post considers nine potential ways to fight mazes in general, out of nine I could come up with. The last method will be the next post in the sequence.</p><h2>Potential Partial Solutions</h2><p><strong>Solution 1: Knowledge</strong></p><p>Not all solutions start with knowledge of the problem. Most of the solutions <i>are good ideas anyway even if you don’t know about mazes.</i></p><p>Knowledge remains a logical place to start any list of solutions. Knowledge is also key to implementation of any of the other solutions. There is a reason we roll our eyes whenever anyone seeks to ‘raise awareness,’ but it is often vital to cause people to notice and understand things they instinctively avoid noticing and understanding.</p><p>People mostly do not understand what mazes are, how they work or the effects they have on those who work for them or interact with them.</p><p>People treat many aspects typical of these mazes as normal that did not used to be considered normal, many of which are not conducive to human flourishing, life or happiness. People entering mazes mostly do not expect what they will find therein. They often spend years of their lives and much of their human and social capital preparing for such roles, both before and after they enter the maze, before realizing what they have signed up for.</p><p>When people do realize what mazes are in time to realize they want out, they are often left without the knowledge and skills to exit and land on their feet. They are also often surrounded by people who would react badly to a decision to exit.</p><p>When people realize what mazes are and are doing to society, and move to help with those problems, they tend to pursue regulatory solutions that make the problems worse rather than better, because those regulatory solutions favor big organizations over small organizations, and entrench existing systems.</p><p>In addition to learning about mazes themselves, people learning what matters in life will generally raise their asking price to participate in mazes, no matter their level of understanding of what they are up against. I am not claiming to know what matters in life, but <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PQ6335puOc"">all the plausible answers</a> point towards staying away from mazes on the margin.</p><p>There are of course some exceptions.<a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2019/03/15/privacy/""> Knowledge is not everywhere and always good for all good things</a>.</p><p>Mazes grow and coordinate in large part via spreading the covert information that being the type of person who supports mazes is how one gets resources. While this information remains covert, it benefits mazes, whether or not it is true. Where it becomes common knowledge, again whether or not it is true, unpredictable things happen. People can fight back, or they can use this to justify imposing maze values more forcefully on others.</p><p>Another place mazes benefit from knowledge is in supportive technologies such as methods of building large organizations.</p><p>Surveillance of individuals tends to favor mazes, and make mazes more damaging to humans, in ways I won’t reiterate here. Surveillance of corporations by default seems like it would do the opposite. But it depends in both cases on what is being measured.</p><p>In most other aspects, both about mazes and not about mazes, <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9QxnfMYccz9QRgZ5z/the-costly-coordination-mechanism-of-common-knowledge"">common knowledge</a> about the world and what is true of it and happening in it in general, as opposed to details about particular events, tends to strictly benefit the non-maze cause against mazes.</p><p><strong>Solution 2: Regulatory Reform</strong></p><p>Society-wide or important problems are not always political problems, and are not always helped by even well-intentioned political intervention.&nbsp;</p><p>The obvious first political intervention is thus almost always to <i>stop making things worse.</i>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capturehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture"">Regulatory capture</a> is the technical term for the inevitable result of government regulation. The mazes that are major corporations and professional associations and accrediting institutions, who have the expertise and lobbying power and financial incentive and perseverance, and the cultural affiliation with a fellow maze, inevitably gain control of the regulatory bodies supervising them. They then engineer those regulations as tools of expropriation: to limit supply and subsidize demand, to stifle innovation, for oligopoly or monopoly, insiders and existing firms against outsiders and upstart firms, for the industry against the public.&nbsp;</p><p>Regulatory gatherings are gatherings of those in the same trade. Adam Smith reminds us in<a href=""https://smile.amazon.com/Wealth-Nations-Adam-Smith/dp/1505577128/ref=sr_1_3?crid=26T0J50ND7E3P&amp;keywords=the+wealth+of+nations&amp;qid=1563187672&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=the+wealth%2Caps%2C143&amp;sr=1-3""> The Wealth of Nations</a> these phenomena might be getting worse but they are not new:</p><blockquote><p>“People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices.”</p></blockquote><p>If we were to simplify the rules and minimize the regulatory burdens, and the regulatory burden on doing pretty much anything at all, in particular on small businesses and the ability of individuals to do object-level work, that would help level the playing field.&nbsp;</p><p>Even where action is effectively permitted, it is usually technically forbidden, and citizens have the correct intuition that doing pretty much anything useful is illegal and would be clamped down on if it threatened the powerful.</p><p>Severely limiting occupational licensing would be the natural place to begin.</p><p>Another strategy would be to end actual direct subsidies to the maze.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Solution 3: End Corporate Welfare, Too Big to Fail and Implicit Subsidies</strong></p><p><a href=""http://benjaminrosshoffman.com/blatant-lies-best-kind/"">Blatant lies are the best kind</a>. Some of the things propping up mazes at public expense, in their fight against real production, is sufficiently brazen that it is obviously and explicitly expropriation.&nbsp;</p><p>Corporate welfare is everywhere despised and everywhere prospering. One could use mistake theory and think of this as an<a href=""https://equilibriabook.com/""> inadequate equilibria</a> problem. If your area subsidizes a large corporation to move, expand or stay, that enriches the corporation at the expense of the public, and gives it an edge on its competition.</p><p>You do it anyway, because it also transfers jobs and other resources from another jurisdiction to yours. Everyone else is doing it, so you can ill afford not to follow suit. Thus, everyone cries out for the policy to end, but does it anyway.&nbsp;</p><p>Maze theory says that this is too generous. Mazes like to make deals with other mazes, to expropriate resources from the public and potential non-maze competition. Thus, they instinctively work together to do this in steadily more corrupt fashion, on steadily grander scales. This correctly predicts a lot of <i>obviously bad and/or obviously unnecessary deals </i>even for the locality in question, such as many deals for new sports stadiums. It also predicts that corporations will often not follow through on their promises, and not be held to account, because the deal is primarily a conspiracy rather than a trade.&nbsp;</p><p>One could respond by pointing to the<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winner%27s_curse""> Winner’s Curse</a> and the need to make risky deals that might not pay off, which also predicts some of the same. That response implicitly accepts that not only can different jurisdictions not cooperate to not go to destructive economic war with each other despite <i>being part of a government, </i>it also implies that they care so little about expropriation of the public by corporations that they do not even ensure that the deal is a net economic win for the local jurisdiction. The argument implicitly accepts that<a href=""https://www.talyarkoni.org/blog/2018/10/02/no-its-not-the-incentives-its-you/""> it’s the incentives</a>, and it would be crazy to act on anything else.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The effect in either case is the same. Regardless of whether you think a given deal is locally good, these deals get more available and more generous as corporations get larger. Thus they constitute an explicit bribe, a tax that gives larger corporations a competitive edge on smaller ones. End that, and the balance shifts back.</p><p>Implicit subsidies are expropriation of resources from the public, in the form of subsidies that are created knowing who the recipients will be, likely for doing nothing or what is already going to be done. Alternatively, they are <i>conditional future expropriation </i>where the government makes clear that if things go a certain way, likely a way that causes mazes trouble, then there will be a bail out. Mostly they go to mazes. Where they don’t, they directly reward maze behaviors. This is obvious pure corruption. Ending or minimizing this would help.</p><p>Too big to fail is a special case of implicit subsidy. If you get big enough, the short-term collateral damage of your potential failure is so big that the government would have no choice but to prop you up at its expense. This is an enormous competitive advantage. Even if shareholders would be wiped out by the intervention, it makes such firms much better business partners, better places to pretend to work, better places to loan money. The shareholders reap those benefits. Even if they didn’t reap the benefits, we all still bear the costs of keeping old dinosaurs around as they become less and less productive and competitive, and their maze levels continue to rise.&nbsp;</p><p>Another subsidy is retroactively strengthened intellectual property protections. Some amount of protection is necessary to allow people to capitalize on innovation and creation, but there can be little doubt that copyright law has run amok at the behest of companies including Disney, and patent law is often now used as a way to bury anyone attempting something new or to protect rents and monopolies long past any reasonable bounds.</p><p><strong>Solution 4: Tort Reform</strong></p><p>As a very rough approximation, in America, the current way lawsuits work is that if something goes wrong, you can attempt to blame anyone in the area. Doing so means they lose a lot of time and money even if you lose in court. In court, you win if you convince a jury, although judges can throw it out. That introduces a lot of random variance, raises risk of doing anything, and greatly advantages anyone who can plausibly deploy the resources to fight back.</p><p>Insurance against this is expensive and requires conforming to the legibility requirements and standards of care laid down by mazes, and <i>still </i>won’t reliably work when things get truly bad and/or someone decides to come after you for real, because your time is still destroyed and you could potentially get liability in excess of any insurance.</p><p>A key concept is <i>standard of care </i>or the similar <i>what a reasonable person would do. </i>Effectively, this means that if you do the thing that is usually done and check off all your boxes, you are mostly safe. If you do <i>anything else, </i>you are at the whim of a jury of random people who do not know anything about the area, and who are focused on the thing that went wrong.</p><p>You can get a waiver of liability or other form of consent and assumption of risk, and this helps <i>somewhat, </i>but they often do not hold up, and many key rights to sue cannot be given away.</p><p>When we employ lawsuits like this, we are enforcing an extreme form of <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2019/04/25/asymmetric-justice/"">Asymmetric Justice</a>. If doing something means capturing a small percent of the gain and being on the hook for all or more than all of the loss, it is going to be hard to find profitable action or divergence from standard action.</p><p>Our justice system enforces Asymmetric Justice towards <i>communication </i>and especially <i>keeping records </i>even more than it does towards actions. Consider<a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-01-10/keep-the-clowns-out-of-email""> this recent column</a> by the excellent Matt Levine. It vividly describes the conflict between engineering, which requires people communicate information and keep accurate records, and the legal system and public relations, which tell you that <i>keeping accurate records is insane. </i>Because in the future, someone will sue you or seek to embarrass you, and they will gain access to your records.</p><p>Those who adopt the maze nature and seek success within a maze also want to destroy records, so they can avoid accountability for mistakes within the organization. Giving a <i>valid, hugely valuable legal rationale </i>for the destruction of knowledge, of favoring the implicit over the explicit in all recorded communication, seems incredibly bad. We need the ability to have<a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2019/03/15/privacy/""> private</a> communication that is both recorded and stays private, which isn’t the result of the<a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2019/02/19/blackmail/""> blackmail</a> that is lawsuits settled by non-disclosure agreements, which is more destruction of records rather than a loophole allowing records.</p><p>This all gets complicated and could of course backfire. Mazes will capitalize on any openings to escape blame or exposure for the things they have done. Juries and results being unpredictable has its huge advantages, both here and elsewhere. This is not an endorsement of any particular action. It is only a note that this is an opportunity for improvement.</p><p><strong>Solution 5: Health Care Reform</strong></p><p>America’s current system of effectively requiring health insurance, since if you attempt to self-insure they inflate your bill to ludicrously fraudulent levels, and making the purchase of health insurance prohibitively expense for individuals or small businesses, acts as a gigantic tax on self-employment and small business.</p><p>Even a small business cannot efficiently buy its employees reasonably priced (even on&nbsp; relative terms to what large business pays) health insurance. If your company can’t buy insurance for you, <i>not only </i>do you pay a huge and increasing premium to use the exchanges or otherwise buy an individual policy, <i>you also are hugely tax disadvantaged.&nbsp;</i></p><p>One <i>does not simply</i> go without health insurance.&nbsp;</p><p>The system allows mazes in the medical industry to capture a large portion of national wealth. People are legally required to allow such mazes to confiscate all of their wealth, if the mazes decide this is appropriate. They can charge arbitrarily large and increasing fees for drugs and actions, which insurance companies must pay, out of insurance people must buy or face even higher prices.&nbsp;</p><p>Getting the right to enter and profit from these mazes requires over a decade navigating educational mazes, which together with existing professionals tightly regulate and ration the right to make human beings more healthy. Getting the right to enter these mazes as a seller of goods usually requires epic spends over years working with existing governmental and other mazes to convince everyone that what you are doing is safe, and thus you are all but forced to then extract rents to make back your money.&nbsp;</p><p>And so on. I would hope I need not convince anyone, regardless of their politics, that our current healthcare system is deeply broken. Other countries have systems less broken in important ways. They usually form and promote mazes in their own ways, but also usually do so to a lesser extent, in a less broad reaching and less toxic way.</p><p>It is difficult to overstate how disastrous this has all been. A crippling of the ability of people to do things at all, on any level, without a major organization, <i>isn’t necessarily even the biggest loss here. </i>As a nation, the United States spends roughly 18% of our GDP on healthcare and has almost nothing to show for it.&nbsp;</p><p>This is not the place to debate or suggest in detail, or even in broad outline, which reforms should be undertaken. It is enough to note that our current hybrid system, where we insist on pretending we use markets but massively distort those “markets” to allow fraudulent rent extraction at every turn, is one of the largest debacles in human history.&nbsp;</p><p>While also acknowledging that <i>things could be made so much worse </i>by the wrong intervention. As has already happened. A lot.</p><p><strong>Solution 6: Demand Less Illusion of Safety and Security</strong></p><p>Demands for real safety and real security will tend to favor existing proven solutions and methods over new ones, because all things being equal they will tend to be safer, and there will be less uncertainty about how safe they are. We demand more real safety than we should, and reducing that would help a bit.</p><p>Real security is tricky, as discussed previously; it’s not clear we know what that actually entails. Demands for real security would involve things like trying to stop atomization, and of course better solutions to existential risk.</p><p>The <i>illusion </i>of safety and security is both in much higher demand, and much more unbalanced in favor of large, established organizations and methods. It puts burden after burden upon any new enterprise, punishing it asymmetrically for any potential perception of new dangers while not giving offsetting reward for reduction of other dangers. New systems must <i>prove </i>that they are at least as safe as existing systems in every possible way, and bear the risk and cost of any exceptions.</p><p>Existing systems can be deeply damaging, but are grandfathered in.</p><p>One can also add things like illusion of fairness to this list.</p><p>A classic way to demonize an existing system or product is to point out this grandfathering: that if it were a new system or product, there is no way it would be permitted. I recently saw this used to argue against bicycles in New York City. But it would be even easier to use this against <i>cars </i>in New York City. Or cars in general, or many other central aspects of life.</p><p>Mazes provide the <i>illusion </i>of security, of a reliable and blameless path in life. Mostly people care primarily about this blamelessness. Getting people to care less about that illusion (and realize it is an illusion) would help a ton.&nbsp;</p><p>Mazes produce things that provide the <i>illusion </i>of safety. Where they do provide safety, they do so in particular ways specified by metrics, which tend to not be where much true risk lies.&nbsp;</p><p>Those products also provide <i>blamelessness. </i>This risk aversion and worry about blame extends to even minor decisions.</p><p>It would be good to get people to care less about such things. Make that a celebrated virtue.</p><p><strong>Solution 7: Change Consumer Behavior</strong></p><p>One can say ‘it’s the incentives’ all one likes. People constantly defy those incentives.</p><p>Ever seen those bumper stickers that say “Support Small Business”? Or local business? People make that choice all the time. Many livelihoods depend on the generosity of those around them. If you tip your taxi driver or waiter, you’re voluntarily paying more to support those around you. The better people treat those around them providing valuable real services, and the more we prioritize making sure they get the profits rather than extractive corporations, the easier it becomes to provide valuable real services.&nbsp;</p><p>Give your business to those around you that are adding value to your life, in the ways that help them do better. Encourage others to do the same. Make it a celebrated virtue. Don’t let stores designed to skim off the most profitable sales from those around them by being one block closer, rather than adding real value, get your business. If the local place helps you figure out what to buy, don’t then go online to find it half a percent cheaper. If an internet service is taking a huge cut for arranging a transaction,<a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2019/02/10/minimize-use-of-standard-internet-food-delivery/""> consider picking up the phone</a>.</p><p>That story is about public goods, and paying your share for those goods, including those that can’t be directly monetized. In some cases this will have such a big payoff that you alone will net benefit. But if that is everyone’s threshold, that’s obviously far too high.</p><p>There are also good self-interested reasons to favor the local and small over the large.</p><p>Exploration and variety are often undervalued, although there are contexts and people where they are overvalued. Story value is important and importantly undervalued, as is learning and experimenting, as is preventing one from ‘wearing out’ the default options.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Local or less popular options tend to be less easy to get started, and less engineered to get you to choose them. Mazes have big data and are experts at steering business their way. Locals are not, and<a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/08/26/play-in-hard-mode/""> the best ones show a disdain for such operations</a>.</p><p>Thus, you will by default tend towards choosing the ‘default’ or ‘easy’ option even if you can’t point to how this is happening. Your instinct towards doing a non-blameworthy thing is also going to overly push one in that direction. It is important to correct for these and other similar biases. A good general life rule that should be its own post is, when in doubt, take the option you believe you are naturally inclined not to take when the decision should be close.&nbsp;</p><p>Local or less popular options also are relatively safe from<a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Goodhart's_law""> Goodhart’s Law</a>, and are more likely to care about illegible aspects of their offerings, or about quality in general even when it does not cash out into profits. If you don’t account for these unknown illegible advantages, and for them valuing you and your experience in the future for their own sakes, you’re not giving them proper credit.&nbsp;</p><p>Consider what is likely to happen over time. A maze will become more of a maze, and their offerings reliably get more customer-hostile both over calendar time, and as users use them. They will keep climbing hills. A smaller operation is under less pressure to do so and gets more rewards from not doing this. You also have opportunity to make the smaller operation stronger and better for what you care about through offering feedback and with your dollars. Thus, getting used to and relying on smaller operations is good long term planning even if they are slightly worse right now.</p><p>The more customer behavior can shift in these ways, the better the playing field for those offering alternatives to mazes.</p><p><strong>Solution 8: End Maze Legitimacy and High Status, and/or Raise Real Work Legitimacy and Status</strong></p><p>Two sides of the same coin.</p><p>We currently give unusually high status to ‘winners’ and those able to extract resources, especially via predictable rents. It shows they are ‘smart’ and ‘successful’ and ‘reliable.’ Instead we could strive to uphold the status of those who do ‘honest work.’ We could value those who have the virtuous version, who honor and choose to hold onto that at personal cost, rather than mocking them as chumps.&nbsp;</p><p>We could make it clear that ‘selling out’ or ‘gaming the system’ was a <i>bad thing, </i>rather than a good one, and recognize what it meant to do so. Some free riding, zero-sum activity and compromise of principles is inevitable. Keeping it to a minimum requires <i>frowning upon it </i>rather than praising it, wanting to move away from rather than towards those who participate. Which in turn means moving towards those who uphold this, and away from those who do not, as in any other norm.&nbsp;</p><p>It is one thing to say that making compromises to win big still gets you praised, because winning big enough eclipses the compromises. It is another thing to say that the compromises <i>are praiseworthy in and of themselves </i>because that means you’re the type who wins big, and that you are <i>more worthy </i>than someone who accomplished the same thing without compromising. Think of how much more they could have accomplished.</p><p>This of course all leads to endless arguments over what activities, jobs, groups, causes, and so on deserve higher or lower status. That is good. We should have those debates, while being careful not to get <i>too </i>distracted by them. The traditional rankings have a lot I strongly disagree with. Only some of those are because people who are seen as doing good and vital work are often instead directly contributing to mazes and rent extraction, whereas many who are seen as extractive are instead directly contributing. And details often matter, a lot.</p><p>(Let’s not litigate these here in the comments, that’s why I’m not naming anything on either end here, even examples I consider clear cut. It would be a distraction.)</p><p><strong>Solution 9: Forcibly Break Up Large Companies</strong></p><p>If large companies are a problem, a logical response is to use the government to break them up. This is central to the platform of a serious contender for the next President of the United States, and has been pointed out in comments of previous sections multiple times as an option, so the idea is worth taking seriously.</p><p>There certainly is a case that if the choices are this or nothing, one can consider this as a reasonable course of action. It certainly is not the&nbsp;<i>first-best&nbsp;</i>course of action. Before you start punishing, taxing or banning something, a good first action is to&nbsp;<i>stop subsidizing and rewarding it first.&nbsp;</i></p><p>Forcibly breaking up large companies that we decide are a problem would be similar to our policy on food, where we pay farmers to produce massive amounts of high fructose corn syrup, then pay marketing people to convince consumers not to eat so much high fructose corn syrup. If you are politically well-connected and can navigate the associated mazes, you get to steal from the public. If you are not so well-connected because you are oriented towards the object-level and value creation, or you lose the fight for any other reason, the public steals from you, instead.</p><p>It is&nbsp;<i>not a coincidence&nbsp;</i>that rather than propose a systematic policy, the companies singled out as targets by this candidate&nbsp;<i>are the relatively new companies, not politically well connected or seen in a good political light, that have best created value for us over the last decade. </i>To the extent that life in these parts has gotten better, it is hard to think of more central reasons for this than Amazon and Google.</p><p>This is illustrative of what happens when one uses the government to enforce such things. The government is the biggest maze of all! If we tie the continued existence of organizations and the value they create and/or capture to the political whims of Washington, we shift what is rewarded even more so from the creation of value to the navigation of mazes and the playing of politics.</p><p>Breaking up all sufficiently large major corporations, or preventing them from engaging in practices that discourage competition, still <i>might&nbsp;</i>be better than doing nothing, if the problem of size is sufficiently bad and we do our best to keep this implemented reasonably and apolitically.</p><p>People, including several major candidates, have also proposed an intentionally destructive confiscatory wealth tax. What would happen under such a wealth tax is left as an exercise to the reader. I will only point out that founders are the best hope of forestalling mazes, and a wealth tax would prevent them from retaining control.</p><p>What are other options? Is there a good version of such a policy that might improve the situation, were it to be implemented, even if it seems completely unrealistic? What is the most realistic version we can come up with?</p><p>Michael Vassar makes the interesting proposal that we should impose a destructive/confiscatory tax on&nbsp;<i>liquid wealth&nbsp;</i>but not impose a tax on <i>illiquid wealth.&nbsp;</i>This would have the effect of heavily encouraging companies to remain or become private. If you had a large percentage of a large private company, taking it public would give you liquid assets, from which the government would then seize more than all the expected returns (e.g. if you tax at 6% annually, that’s effectively confiscating<i>&nbsp;all </i>the value of an asset to the extent it is not used for consumption.) The only reason to take a company public would be if you intended to divest, at which point you would have to figure out how to make the bulk of your resulting assets illiquid again.</p><p>This would be hugely destructive of value. Liquidity is valuable and highly valued. Intentionally creating illiquidity destroys that value, and likely involves additional huge destruction of value. So does reducing the market price of liquid assets. We would be back to the world in which you were paranoid that if you got anything useful to a bandit that bandits would come and seize it (or worse). Think Apocalypseburg from The Lego Movie 2, where everything and everyone is super dark and grim in order to not provide any potential value to outsiders. Anything that isn’t super dark and grim is instantly destroyed by “aliens” whose attention is drawn to them.</p><p>There is also the problem that defining what is liquid versus illiquid is tricky. If it is a matter of taxing things that list on exchanges than all you did was ban transparent exchanges that could be efficiently used by outsiders and the public, and replace them with maze networks that take advantage of the public and give the profits and deals to those with good connections while not properly allocating capital. If it is a matter of trying to figure out what someone actually can’t sell, or otherwise gets complicated, then the primary way of retaining wealth becomes convincing the government that your assets are illiquid.</p><p>One thing that seems likely, on top of the inevitable regulatory capture and carved out exceptions, is a bunch of shell corporations designed to be illiquid, whose ownership is divided in hard to measure ways, which then hold the liquid assets.</p><p>Thus, I do not think such plans survive contact with the enemy.</p><p>Any solution to these problems must be strictly formulaic. It must merit no exceptions and minimize the amount of game playing. This means keeping it simple. It also would ideally protect new companies and their founders.</p><p>As stated above, I would not start on this response without first doing everything I could to implement solution three. Once that was exhausted, I might consider something like a tax, escalating with size, on large organizations that have existed for a minimum amount of time and are no longer controlled by their founder.&nbsp;</p><h2>Last Idea</h2><p>The next post will consider the ninth and final method, which asks “what could one determined person with resources do without resorting to politics?” and answers this with “actually they could do quite a bit.”</p><p>They could Create a Full Alternative Stack.</p></body></html>",Zvi,zvi,Zvi,

These technologies (in a broad sense, even hand-washing is a technology) have largely eliminated lethal diseases such as smallpox, malaria, cholera, tuberculosis, and polio, at least in the developed world.</p><p>But which of these technologies mattered most? Which should we highlight in a history of health and medicine, and which should we hold in our minds as major examples of human progress against disease?</p><p>Most histories of medicine give the spotlight to vaccines and antibiotics. They’re the most effective medical <i>treatments</i>; prior to their introduction, there was little a doctor could do for an infected patient.</p><p>But to really answer the question, we should look at mortality rates over time, by disease where possible, and correlate reductions in mortality to specific interventions effective against specific classes of disease. Otherwise we run the risk of assuming that just since something is in all the histories, it must be the most important (leading me to then feature it prominently in <i>my</i> history, thereby perpetuating the cycle).</p><p>So I started looking into the data and interpretations of it. And the surprising thing I found is that infectious disease mortality rates have been declining steadily since <i>long</i> before vaccines or antibiotics.</p><hr><p>First, let’s look at the data that clearly shows that something was going on prior to any effective medical treatment for most diseases.</p><p>Here’s a chart of 20th century mortality in the US [1] (the spike around 1918 is a major worldwide influenza epidemic, sometimes known as the Spanish Flu):</p><figure><img src=""https://rootsofprogress.org/img/armstrong-1999-fig-2.png""><figcaption><i>US crude mortality rates&nbsp;</i><br><a href=""https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/768249""><i>Armstrong, Conn &amp; Pinner 1999, Fig. 2</i></a></figcaption></figure><p>And here’s a similar chart I made for England and Wales:</p><figure><img src=""https://rootsofprogress.org/img/mckeown-1975-chart.png""><figcaption><i>Mortality rates in England &amp; Wales, age- and sex-standardized to 1901&nbsp;</i><br><a href=""https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00324728.1975.10412707""><i>Data from McKeown, Record &amp; Turner 1975</i></a></figcaption></figure><p>Mortality rates in both regions fell, and most of the improvement came from the infectious disease mortality rate, which was reduced by more than an order of magnitude.</p><p>Extending the analysis further into the past is difficult. Data is available back to the mid-1800s, but disease classification changes over time as scientific and medical knowledge advances, so it’s not always possible to trace the mortality rate from a single disease; and prior to the mid-1800s, no countries that I know of kept reliable cause-of-death records. We do have overall mortality rates from some countries stretching back into the 1800s and even 1700s in some cases, and from these we can see that mortality rates in Europe have been dropping for a long time [2]</p><figure><img src=""https://rootsofprogress.org/img/mckeown-1972-fig-13.png""><figcaption><a href=""https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00324728.1972.10405908""><i>McKeown, Brown &amp; Record 1972</i></a></figcaption></figure><p>To estimate population and mortality figures prior to these datasets, demographers turn to increasingly limited and unreliable sources, such as parish records of births and deaths, or the London Bills of Mortality, which began running continuously in 1603. These estimates are rough, but they generally show that death rates began to fall in some parts of Europe by 1740 (and in some parts possibly as early as 1670), [3] and that declines in disease mortality were a significant part of this.</p><p>In contrast to this timeline, very few effective medical treatments were in widespread use until the late 1930s. Before that time, only a handful of vaccines for major diseases were in use (most notably for <a href=""https://rootsofprogress.org/smallpox-and-vaccines"">smallpox</a>); and there were only a couple of effective pharmaceuticals (most notably for diphtheria, tetanus and syphilis).</p><p>The role of some major factor other than medical treatment is even more clear if you break out the mortality rates by specific diseases. In 1900, the most deaths came from tuberculosis, influenza/pneumonia, and gastroenteric diseases such as dysentery. [1][4][5] All of these were effectively conquered by antibiotics in the 1930s and ’40s, but were on the decline since at least the beginning of the century. Some charts that illustrate this in the US: [4]</p><figure><img src=""https://rootsofprogress.org/img/cutler-2001-fig-5.png""><figcaption><i>US pneumonia &amp; influenza deaths&nbsp;</i><br><a href=""https://www.nber.org/papers/w8556""><i>Cutler &amp; Meara 2001, Fig. 5</i></a></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=""https://rootsofprogress.org/img/cutler-2001-fig-6.png""><figcaption><i>US tuberculosis deaths&nbsp;</i><br><a href=""https://www.nber.org/papers/w8556""><i>Cutler &amp; Meara 2001, Fig. 6</i></a></figcaption></figure><p>A similar chart for England &amp; Wales [5] (“chemotherapy” here means antibiotics):</p><figure><img src=""https://rootsofprogress.org/img/mckeown-1975-fig-6.png""><figcaption><i>Respiratory tuberculosis mortality, standardized to the 1901 age-sex distribution&nbsp;</i><br><a href=""https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00324728.1975.10412707""><i>McKeown, Record &amp; Turner 1975, Fig. 6</i></a></figcaption></figure><p>Indeed, digging further into the UK data from the late 1800s, we can see that TB was declining since at least 1850 and gastroenteric disease since the 1870s [6]. And similar patterns hold for lesser killers such as measles, which didn’t have a vaccine until the 1960s, but which by then had already declined in mortality by more than 90% from its 1900 levels.[1][4]</p><p>So what was going on? If you read my <a href=""https://rootsofprogress.org/weapons-against-infectious-disease"">survey of technologies against infectious disease</a>, you know that other than drugs and immunization, there is one other way to fight germs: cleaning up the environment.</p><hr><p>I was surprised to learn that sanitation efforts began as early as the 1700s—and that these efforts were based on data collection and analysis, long before a full scientific theory of infection had been worked out. James Riley, in “Insects and the European Mortality Decline”, writes: [3]</p><blockquote><p>In the later decades of the seventeenth and early decades of the eighteenth century, a number of internationally renowned physicians … formulated specific measures of intervention. Relying on Hippocratic tradition, specifically, on its suggestion that endemic and epidemic diseases are caused by forces in the environment, and influenced by Renaissance efforts at urban sanitation, these physicians proposed to discover the meteorological and topographical forces that might be blamed for the onset of epidemics. Toward this end, they and their followers embarked on a vast campaign to assemble qualitative and quantitative data about epidemics, climate and weather, geographical and topographical signs, and other features of the habitat. Their aim was to find conjunctures or correlations in the data, occasions when epidemics occurred after the same complex of environmental forces. Early signs of such a complex would offer warnings and allow the adoption of measures of prevention and avoidance. This body of medical theory failed to produce a coherent list of correlations, but it did provide a specific body of measures of avoidance and prevention.</p></blockquote><p>In particular, they proposed (each bullet quoted from the article):</p><ul><li>to drain swamps, bogs, moats, and other sites of standing water</li><li>to introduce hydraulic devices that would circulate water in canals and cisterns</li><li>to flush refuse from areas of human habitation</li><li>to ventilate living quarters and meeting places and to burn sulfur sticks or apply other insecticidal measures in houses, hospitals, prisons, meeting halls, and ships</li><li>to inter corpses outside the city</li><li>and by other measures, including refuse burial, to detach humankind from organic waste</li></ul><p>These reforms were implemented starting in the 1740s, some by local and central governments, others by “humanitarians acting on private initiative”.</p><p>What broad changes were actually implemented, and is it plausible that they had a significant impact?</p><blockquote><p>To have had a significant effect on insect numbers, the measures proposed by the environmentalists [the physicians advocating environmental cleanup] would have had to have been broadly applied across western Europe. Two measures, lavation and drainage, are particularly important in insect control, and we can focus on examples of their application. Lavation combines programs taking three forms: flushing filth from urban sites, collecting and disposing of refuse, and introducing devices to agitate or circulate standing water. By these means, which would cleanse streets, industrial sites, and buildings, and transform standing water in canals and cisterns into moving water, the environmentalists argued, the city might be made as healthy as the countryside. One model for these proposals was the naturally washed site of the town of Chester, England, where rain periodically flushed refuse into a subterranean drainage network cleansed by tidal action. The objective of the environmentalists was to introduce the same action by hydraulic engineering. Another model was the program followed in Hamburg to collect and dispose of refuse outside the city each day. A third was the improvement of streets by paving and widening, and of urban drainage networks by constructing or expanding sewage systems. Measures of one or another variety were adopted in many British cities and towns in the Improvement Acts of the 1760s and thereafter, and observers, such as William White in York, attributed declines in mortality specifically to them. In Paris, the drainage system was improved in 1740, and later in the century, other measures, including the emptying of cesspits and the installation of sewers, followed. In the Austrian Empire, Johann Peter Frank directed a broad campaign of medical policing, which included projects for refuse collection and disposal.</p></blockquote><p>These efforts affected not only diseases such as malaria, where insects are the primary vector of infection, but also others such as dysentery in which insects (especially flies and cockroaches) can distribute the disease throughout the environment, e.g., from waste to food. Pest control thus provides the best explanation I’ve found for reductions in the mortality rate from the mid-1700s to early 1800s.</p><p>After that point, there were some significant shifts in the population and in disease.</p><hr><p>As insects became better controlled in the countryside, people began migrating in greater numbers to cities, which worsened disease due to crowding and polluted water. Malaria was on the wane; cholera was on the rise. The mortality rate, after declining for decades, actually plateaued in the mid-1800s, [3] and mortality rates were higher in cities than in the country. [7]</p><p>The worsening conditions in the increasingly crowded cities caught the attention of sanitary reformers throughout Europe, such as Edwin Chadwick in Britain and Max von Pettenkofer in Germany, who campaigned in particular for improvements in water and sewage. Starting in the mid-1800s, cities in Europe and the US sought cleaner sources of water, further upstream, or from less polluted rivers. The water was piped into homes, which reduced reliance on wells and surface water. Later, many cities built water filtration systems—the earliest method was simply to allow the water to pass through sand. They also built or modernized sewer systems to transport human waste outside the city and dump it downstream or into the sea, instead of allowing it to collect in pit latrines or cesspools in town, or run through the streets or in open trenches. And crucially, they made sure to keep these systems separate, so that sewage didn’t contaminate drinking water.[7][8]</p><figure style=""width:38.04%;""><img src=""https://rootsofprogress.org/img/typhoid-cartoon-1919.png""><figcaption><i>1919 cartoon showing Typhoid as a skeleton monster, beaten to the ground by Filtration Plant and Liquid Chlorine&nbsp;</i><br><br><a href=""https://www.nber.org/papers/w10511""><i>Sourced from Cutler &amp; Miller 2004</i></a></figcaption></figure><p>These early efforts, however, were sometimes for aesthetics as much as they were for health, and even to the extent they were aimed at health, they could only be guided by smell, taste and color. [9] But in the late 1800s, the germ theory of disease was established by scientists including Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch. By the 1880s, specific bacteria had been identified as the cause of certain diseases, such as tuberculosis and cholera. Along with this came techniques to grow bacteria in culture and to identify them under the microscope.</p><p>These new ideas and methods gave sanitation efforts new tools and targets: instead of aiming to improve sensory qualities, they could aim to eliminate harmful bacteria. Filtration was improved, and chlorine was added to kill germs—first in drinking water, and then in sewage itself. [10]</p><p>Cutler &amp; Miller estimate [10] that</p><blockquote><p>the introduction of water filtration and chlorination systems led to major reductions in mortality, explaining nearly half of the overall reduction in mortality between 1900 and 1936. Our results also suggest that clean water was responsible for three-quarters of the decline in infant mortality and nearly two-thirds of the decline in child mortality. The magnitude of these effects is striking. Clean water also appears to have led to the near eradication of typhoid fever, a waterborne scourge of the 19th and early 20th Centuries.</p></blockquote><p>They chart mortality from typhoid in several major cities, of which Pittsburgh is the most dramatic:</p><figure><img src=""https://rootsofprogress.org/img/cutler-2004-fig-2-philadelphia.png""><figcaption><a href=""https://www.nber.org/papers/w10511""><i>Cutler &amp; Miller 2004, Fig. 2</i></a></figcaption></figure><p>Food handling improved as well. Milk is a case in point: In England, as of the late 1800s, milk was transported warm in open containers, making it a literal breeding ground for tuberculosis and other bacterial diseases. Pasteurization was introduced around 1900, along with sealed tins and bottles for transporting and storing milk. Condensed and evaporated milk also became popular around this time, and since these products were sterile they also reduced diseases. All these innovations contributed to the rapid decline in infant mortality seen here: [11]</p><figure><img src=""https://rootsofprogress.org/img/beaver-1973-fig-1.png""><figcaption><a href=""https://www.jstor.org/stable/2173395?seq=1""><i>Beaver 1973, Fig. 1</i></a></figcaption></figure><p>Finally, the germ theory led to public health efforts to educate the populace on good general hygiene. A policy brief by Samuel Preston says: [9]</p><blockquote><p>Enlightened public health officials were quick to recognize how the germ theory should guide their practice. Furthermore, by the time of the first White House Conference on Infant Mortality, held in 1909, they realized that rapid advances in longevity required that public officials go beyond their normal domain of public works and attempt to change the personal health practices of individuals. The germ theory provided a number of powerful weapons for doing so. These included boiling bottles and milk, washing hands, protecting food from flies, isolating sick children, and ventilating rooms. Public health officials launched massive campaigns to encourage these practices. In New York City, milk depots were established with the ostensible purpose of distributing milk to indigent mothers but with the real purpose, according to the director, of instructing mothers in hygienic practices. The New York City Department of Health produced one of the nation’s first motion pictures, entitled <i>The Fly Pest</i>. At the national level, the new Children’s Bureau adopted a primary focus on child health. Its pamphlet called <i>Infant Care</i> became the largest selling volume in the history of the Government Printing Office, with some 12 million copies sold by 1940. By the 1920s, the bureau was receiving and answering over 100,000 letters a year from parents seeking child care advice.</p></blockquote><p>Thus the germ theory, long before it led to medical <i>treatments</i>, drove down mortality rates by revolutionizing sanitation and hygiene.</p><hr><p>So the mortality data points to a large and easy-to-underappreciate role of pest control, water sanitation, food handling, and general hygiene.</p><p>However, it also shows the extreme effectiveness of antibiotics, when they were finally invented. In the US, during the golden age of antibiotics from 1937 to ‘52, the infectious disease mortality rate fell by 8.2%/year, compared to an average of 2.8%/year during 1900–36 and 2.3%/year during 1953–80. [1] The inset in the following chart illustrates this by overlaying two exponential curves representing the two slower declines before and after; the antibiotics era is in between, where the blue line rapidly falls from the higher curve to the lower:</p><figure><img src=""https://rootsofprogress.org/img/armstrong-1999-fig-1.png""><figcaption><i>US crude infectious disease mortality rates&nbsp;</i><br><a href=""https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/768249""><i>Armstrong, Conn &amp; Pinner 1999, Fig. 1 (annotations added)</i></a></figcaption></figure><p>Just based on this timing, it’s not unreasonable to estimate that antibiotics alone were responsible for a decrease in the mortality rate of something like 5.4%/year for 15 years, or an overall reduction of over 56%.</p><p>What about vaccines? Vaccines <a href=""https://rootsofprogress.org/smallpox-and-vaccines"">eradicated smallpox</a>, which was a leading cause of death in the 1700s, although we can’t know precisely how much it contributed to 18th-century mortality, since the disease had been greatly diminished by the time causes of death were widely and reliably recorded. A vaccine was also the solution for polio, which caused few deaths compared to many other diseases, but many cases of paralysis. For other diseases, though, vaccines mostly came along late in the game and mopped up what was left after improved sanitation and hygiene had done most of the work.</p><p>The other reason that vaccines don’t rack up as many points is that, by coincidence, they weren’t a good fit for the most common and lethal diseases. The flu has too many strains, and mutates too fast, for a highly effective vaccine; the BCG vaccine for tuberculosis also has varying efficacy (for reasons still not fully understood [12]). Pneumonia and gastroenteric diseases are opportunistic infections that can be caused by any of multiple types of germs; a vaccine only protects against specific germs, and so the vaccines we have for these diseases can only target the most common causes.</p><p>However, judged by effectiveness, vaccines score very well, having reduced morbidity for several important diseases by over 99% [13] (<a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00056803.htm"">see original</a> for notes and caveats):</p><figure><table><thead><tr><th>Disease</th><th>Baseline morbidity</th><th>1998 morbidity</th><th>% decrease</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Smallpox</td><td>48,164</td><td>0</td><td>100.0%</td></tr><tr><td>Diphtheria</td><td>175,885</td><td>1</td><td>100.0%</td></tr><tr><td>Pertussis</td><td>147,271</td><td>6,279</td><td>95.7%</td></tr><tr><td>Tetanus</td><td>1,314</td><td>34</td><td>97.4%</td></tr><tr><td>Poliomyelitis (paralytic)</td><td>16,316</td><td>0</td><td>100.0%</td></tr><tr><td>Measles</td><td>503,282</td><td>89</td><td>100.0%</td></tr><tr><td>Mumps</td><td>152,209</td><td>606</td><td>99.6%</td></tr><tr><td>Rubella</td><td>47,745</td><td>345</td><td>99.3%</td></tr><tr><td>Congenital rubella syndrome</td><td>823</td><td>5</td><td>99.4%</td></tr><tr><td>Haemophilus influenzae type b</td><td>20,000</td><td>54</td><td>99.7%</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>In my <a href=""https://rootsofprogress.org/weapons-against-infectious-disease"">previous survey of anti-disease technologies</a>, I also mentioned antiseptics and sterilization. Where do these techniques show up? Primarily in the hospital, it turns out. These techniques are critical for surgical and maternal mortality, reducing post-operation infections and childbed (aka “puerperal”) fever. But diseases of surgery and childbirth are relatively rare compared to those of everyday life, and so they don’t figure prominently in overall mortality rates.</p><hr><p>The bottom line is that sanitation—pest control, water filtration and chlorination, safe sewage disposal, milk pasteurization and other food safety, and public education about general hygiene—probably did more than anything else to reduce mortality rates, if only because these techniques were available decades, and in some cases centuries, before anything else. Antibiotics were dramatically effective when they were finally introduced, but by this point a lot of the work had already been done. Vaccines too were extremely effective, but merely delivered the <i>coup de grace</i> for many diseases. Other techniques, while very important in limited spheres, simply addressed problems that were too small to show up on any of the top lists.</p><p>What strikes me about all this is a similar pattern to what I’ve previously written on <a href=""https://rootsofprogress.org/science-and-the-industrial-revolution"">science &amp; the Industrial Revolution</a>:</p><ol><li>A naive or cursory look at the history gives a simplistic account: Medicine reduced disease! Science saves lives!</li><li>A closer look reveals that disease mortality was dropping long before antibiotics or vaccines. So (some hastily conclude) medicine didn’t really matter after all—so much for better living through science!</li><li>An even closer look shows that actually, the germ theory led to sanitation and hygiene improvements decades before we had specific treatments. So, <a href=""https://rootsofprogress.org/science-and-steam"">as with the steam engine</a>, it turns out science <i>was</i> relevant, just not in the obvious first place one might look.</li><li>Finally, the galaxy-brain take looks not only at direct influences but indirect/cultural ones: The Scientific Revolution led to new ways of experimenting and collecting/analyzing data that led to practical improvements (in waste disposal and insect control) long before we had a fundamental scientific theory.</li></ol><hr><p><i>Thanks to Tyler Cowen, Matt Bateman, Andrew Layman, Sean Pawley, Ben Landau-Taylor, and Michael Goff for reviewing drafts of this post.</i></p><p><strong>References</strong></p><ol><li><a href=""https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.281.1.61"">Armstrong, G.

<p>This post is structured modularly; different sections may be of interest to different readers, and should be useful in isolation from the rest of the post. The post also includes links to articles and videos introducing relevant concepts, to make the post accessible to readers without relevant technical backgrounds.</p>
<h1>Vector fields and preferences</h1>
<p>A <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector"">vector</a> represents both magnitude and direction; for example, velocity is a vector that represents not just the speed at which one is travelling but also the direction of travel. A <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_field"">vector field</a> essentially associates a vector to each point in a region of space. For example, the following image (<a href=""https://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/magnetic-forces-and-magnetic-fields/magnetic-field-current-carrying-wire/a/what-are-magnetic-fields"">source</a>) shows the strength (represented by arrow lengths) and direction of the magnetic field at various points around a bar magnet:</p>
<p><img src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/dwbqmbkdb/image/upload/v1580239962/Magnetic_field_wdw8tw.png"" alt=""""></p>
<p><em>Figure 1.</em></p>
<p>Another common usage of vector fields is to represent the direction in which fluid would flow, for example the downhill flow of water on uneven terrain (<a href=""https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus/thinking-about-multivariable-function/visualizing-vector-valued-functions/v/fluid-flow-and-vector-fields"">this short video</a> shows and discusses that visualisation).</p>
<p>We believe that vector fields over “state spaces” (possible states of the world, represented by positions along each dimension) can be a useful tool for analysis and communication of various issues (e.g., existential risk strategy, AI alignment). In particular, we’re interested in the idea of representing preferences as “preference vector fields” (PVFs), in which, at each point in the state space, a vector represents which direction in the state space an agent would prefer to move from there, and how intense that preference is.<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-9mzEHb25RTeQQ6qGS-1"" id=""fnref-9mzEHb25RTeQQ6qGS-1"">[1]</a></sup> (For the purposes of this post, “agent” could mean an AI, a human, a community, humanity as a whole, etc.)</p>
<p>To illustrate this, the following PVF shows a hypothetical agent’s preferences over a state space in which the only dimensions of interest are wealth and security.<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-9mzEHb25RTeQQ6qGS-2"" id=""fnref-9mzEHb25RTeQQ6qGS-2"">[2]</a></sup><sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-9mzEHb25RTeQQ6qGS-3"" id=""fnref-9mzEHb25RTeQQ6qGS-3"">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p><img src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/dwbqmbkdb/image/upload/v1580239963/Figure_2_Vectors_gkybi1.png"" alt=""""></p>
<p><em>Figure 2.</em></p>
<p>The fact that (at least over the domain shown here) the arrows always point at least slightly upwards and to the right shows that the agent prefers more wealth and security to less, regardless of the current level of those variables. The fact that the arrows are longest near the x axis shows that preferences are most intense when security is low. The fact that the arrows become gradually more horizontal as we move up the y axis shows that, as security increases, the agent comes to care more about wealth relative to security.</p>
<h2>Not only preferences</h2>
<p>In a very similar way, vector fields can be used to represent things other than preferences. For example, we might suspect that for many agents (e.g., most/all humans), preferences do not perfectly match what would actually make the agent happier (e.g., because of the agent being mistaken about something, or having separate systems for reward vs motivation). In this case, we could create a vector field to represent the agent’s preferences (represented by the blue arrows below), and another to represent what changes from any given point would increase the agent’s happiness (represented by the green arrows).</p>
<p><img src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/dwbqmbkdb/image/upload/v1580239967/Figure_3_Vectors_cl7b39.png"" alt=""""></p>
<p><em>Figure 3.</em></p>
<p>This method of layering vector fields representing different things can be used as one tool in analysing potential clashes between different things (e.g., between an agent’s preferences and what would actually make the agent happy, or between an agent’s <em>beliefs</em> about what changes would be likely at each state and what changes would <em>actually</em> be likely at each state).</p>
<p>For example, the above graph indicates that, as wealth and/or security increases (i.e., as we move across the x axis and/or up the y axis), there is an increasing gap between the agent’s preferences and what would make the agent happy. In particular, security becomes increasingly more important than wealth for the agent’s happiness, but this is not reflected in the agent’s preferences.</p>
<p>(Note that, while it does make sense to compare the direction in which arrows from two different vector fields point, I haven’t yet thought much about whether it makes sense to compare the lengths Grapher shows for their arrows. It seems like this is <em>mathematically</em> the same as the common problem of trying to compare utility functions across different agents, or preferences across different voters. But here the functions represent different things within the <em>same</em> agent, which may make a difference.)</p>
<h1>Gradients and utility functions</h1>
<p>When a vector field has no “curl” (see the section “Curl and inconsistent preferences” below), the vector field can be thought of as the <a href=""https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus/multivariable-derivatives/gradient-and-directional-derivatives/v/gradient"">gradient</a> of a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_field"">scalar field</a>.<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-9mzEHb25RTeQQ6qGS-4"" id=""fnref-9mzEHb25RTeQQ6qGS-4"">[4]</a></sup> (A scalar field is similar to a vector field, except that it associates a <em>scalar</em> with each point in a region of space, and scalars have only magnitude, rather than magnitude <em>and</em> <em>direction</em>.) Essentially, this means that the arrows of the vector field can be thought of as pointing “uphill”, away from low points and towards high points of the associated scalar function. If the vector field represents preferences, higher points of the scalar function would be where preferences are more satisfied, and lower points are where it is less satisfied; thus, the scalar function can be thought of as the agent’s utility function.<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-9mzEHb25RTeQQ6qGS-5"" id=""fnref-9mzEHb25RTeQQ6qGS-5"">[5]</a></sup> (The same basic method is often used in physics, in which context the scalar function typically represents <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_potential"">scalar potential</a>.)</p>
<p>Below is one visualisation of the scalar field representing the utility function of the agent from the previous example (based on its preferences, not on what would make it “happy”), as well as the related vector field. Colours towards the red end of the spectrum represent higher values of the scalar field. It can be seen that the arrows of the vector field point away from blue areas and towards red areas, representing the agent’s preference for “climbing uphill” on its utility function.</p>
<p><img src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/dwbqmbkdb/image/upload/v1580239979/Figure_4_Vectors_xjq6sz.png"" alt=""""></p>
<p><em>Figure 4.</em></p>
<p>The scalar field can also be represented in three dimensions, as values on the z dimension, which are in turn a function of values on the x and y dimensions. This is shown below (from two angles), for the same agent. (These graphs are a little hard to interpret from still images on a 2D screen, at least with this function; such graphs can be easier to interpret when one is able to rotate the angle of view.)</p>
<p><img src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/dwbqmbkdb/image/upload/v1580239979/Figure_5_Vectors_ma27vo.png"" alt=""""></p>
<p><em>Figures 5a and 5b.</em></p>
<h2>Method</h2>
<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLAK2IsQ_Uo"">This video</a> provides one clear explanation of the actual method for determining the scalar function that a curl-free vector field can be thought of as the gradient of (though the video is focused on cases of 3D vector fields). That video describes this as finding the “potential”; as noted earlier, when the vector field represents preferences, the utility function can be thought of as analogous to the “potential” in other cases.</p>
<p>Personally, as a quick method of finding the scalar function associated with a 2D vector field, I used the following algorithm, from the first answer on <a href=""https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/questions/100758/finding-scalar-potential-function"">this page</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>DSolve[{D[f[x, y], x] == [X COMPONENT OF THE VECTOR FIELD], D[f[x, y], y] == [Y COMPONENT OF THE VECTOR FIELD]}, f[x, y], {x, y}]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I input the algorithm into a <a href=""https://www.wolframcloud.com/"">Wolfram Cloud notebook</a>, which seems to be free to use as long as you create an account. (As noted in the answer on the linked page, this algorithm will come back with no solution if the vector field has curl. This makes sense, because this general approach cannot be used in this way if a field has curl; this is explained in the section “Curl and inconsistent preferences” below.) Finally, I double-checked that the function was a valid solution by using <a href=""https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=grad+of+a+scalar+field&amp;assumption=%7B%22F%22%2C+%22GradientCalculator%22%2C+%22scalarfunction%22%7D+-%3E"">this calculator</a> to find its gradient, which should then be the same as the original vector field.</p>
<h1>Extrapolating PVFs (and utility functions) from specific preference data</h1>
<p>In reality, one rarely knows an agent’s actual utility function or their full PVF. Instead, one is likely to only have data on the agent’s (apparent) preferences at <em>particular points</em> in state space; for example, the extent to which they wanted more wealth and more security when they had $10,000 of savings and a “4/5” level of security.</p>
<p>One can imagine extrapolating a full preference vector field (PVF) from that data. We do not know of a precise method for actually doing this (we plan to do more research and thought regarding that in future). However, conceptually speaking, it seems the process would be analogous to fitting a regression line to observed data points, and, like that process, would require striking a balance between maximising fit with the data and avoiding <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting"">overfitting</a>.</p>
<p>For an example (based very loosely on Figure 3 in <a href=""https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09544820500275032"">this article</a>), suppose that I know that Alice prefers car A to Car B, Car B to Car C, Car C to Car D, and Car D to Car A (i.e., to Alice, A&gt;B&gt;C&gt;D&gt;A).<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-9mzEHb25RTeQQ6qGS-6"" id=""fnref-9mzEHb25RTeQQ6qGS-6"">[6]</a></sup> I also know the weight (in thousands of pounds) and perceived “sportiness” (as rated by consumers) of the four cars, and am willing to make the simplifying assumption that these are the only factors that influenced Alice’s preferences. I could then create a plane with weight on the x axis and sportiness on the y axis, show the position of the four cars in this space, and represent Alice’s preferences with arrows pointing from each car towards the car Alice would prefer to that one, as shown below:<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-9mzEHb25RTeQQ6qGS-7"" id=""fnref-9mzEHb25RTeQQ6qGS-7"">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p><img src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/dwbqmbkdb/image/upload/v1580239980/Figure_6_vectors_ggb5qp.png"" alt=""""></p>
<p><em>Figure 6.</em></p>
<p>I could then infer a PVF that (1) approximately captures Alice’s known preferences, and (2) suggests what preferences Alice would have at any other point in the plane (rather than just at the four points I have data for). In this case, one seemingly plausible PVF is shown below, with the length of each blue arrow representing the strength of Alice’s preferences at the associated point. (This PVF still shows Alice’s known preferences, but this is just for ease of comparison; those known preferences are not actually part of the PVF itself.)</p>
<p><img src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/dwbqmbkdb/image/upload/v1580239990/Figure_7_vectors_mktb8i.png"" alt=""""></p>
<p><em>Figure 7.</em></p>
<p>This PVF allows us to make predictions about what Alice’s preferences would be even in situations we do not have any empirical data about. For example, this PVF suggests that if Alice had the hypothetical car E (with a weight of ~2000 pounds and sportiness of ~55), she would prefer a car that was heavier and was higher for sportiness. In contrast, the PVF also suggests that, if she had the hypothetical car F (with a weight of ~6000 pounds and sportiness of ~55), she would prefer a car that was heavier and was rated <em>lower</em> for sportiness.</p>
<p>Of course, these predictions are not necessarily accurate. One could likely create many other PVFs that also “appear” to roughly fit Alice’s known preferences, and these could lead to different predictions. This highlights why we wish to find a more precise/“rigorous” method to better accomplish the goal I have conceptually gestured at here.</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that one could extrapolate an agent’s utility function from limited preference data by first using the method gestured at here and then using the method covered in the previous section. That is, one could gather some data on an agent’s (apparent) preferences, extrapolate a PVF that “fits” that data, and then calculate what (set of) scalar function(s) that vector field is the gradient of. That scalar function would be the agent’s extrapolated utility function.</p>
<p>However, as noted earlier, this method only works if the PVF has no “curl”, so it would not work in the case of Alice’s preferences about cars. I will now discuss what I mean by “curl”, what implications curl has, and a rough idea for “removing” it.</p>
<h1>Curl and inconsistent preferences</h1>
<p>In the example above, to Alice, A&gt;B&gt;C&gt;D&gt;A. This is a case of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intransitivity#Occurrences_in_preferences"">intransitivity</a>, or, less formally, circular or inconsistent preferences. This is typically <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/waF2Pomid7YHjfEDt/p/zJZvoiwydJ5zvzTHK"">seen as</a> <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/waF2Pomid7YHjfEDt/p/zNcLnqHF5rvrTsQJx"">irrational</a>, and as opening agents up to issues such as being “<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_pump"">money pumped</a>”. It seems that Alice would be willing to just keep paying us to let her trade in one car for the one she preferred to that one, and do this <em>endlessly</em> - going around and around in a circle, yet feeling that her preferences are being continually satisfied.</p>
<p>So another pair of reasons why representing preferences as vector fields is helpful is that doing so allows inconsistencies in preferences:</p>
<ol>
<li>to be directly seen (if they are sufficiently extreme)</li>
<li>to be calculated as the vector field’s <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curl_(mathematics)"">curl</a></li>
</ol>
<p><a href=""https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus/multivariable-derivatives/curl-grant-videos/v/2d-curl-intuition"">This video</a> introduces the concept of curl. Returning to the visualisation of vector fields as representing the direction in which water would flow over a certain domain, curl represents the speed and direction an object would spin if placed in the water. For example, if there is a strong clockwise curl at a certain point, a stick placed there would rotate clockwise; if there is no curl at a point, a stick placed there would not rotate (though it still may move in some direction, as represented by the vector field itself).</p>
<p>Note that the concepts of curl and inconsistency will also apply in less extreme cases (i.e., where an agent’s preferences do not <em>only</em> “chase each other around in circles”).</p>
<p>As noted earlier, when a vector field has curl, one cannot find its gradient. In our context, this seems logical; if an agent’s preferences are inconsistent, it seems that the agent cannot have a true utility function, and that we can’t assign any meaningful “height” to any point in the 2D state space. Consider again the example of Alice’s preferences for cars; if we were to interpret meeting her preferences as moving “uphill” on a utility function, she could keep arriving back at the same points in the state space and yet be at different “heights”, which doesn’t seem to make sense.</p>
<h2>Removing curl to create consistent utility functions</h2>
<p>It seems that agents frequently have intransitive preferences, and thus that their PVFs will often have some curl. It would therefore be very useful to have a method for “removing curl” from a PVF, to translate an intransitive set of preferences into a transitive set of preferences, while making a minimum of changes. This new, consistent PVF would also then allow for the generation of a corresponding utility function for the agent.<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-9mzEHb25RTeQQ6qGS-8"" id=""fnref-9mzEHb25RTeQQ6qGS-8"">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>We believe that this process should be possible. We also believe that, if developed and confirmed to make sense, it could be useful for various aspects of AI alignment (among other things). In particular, it could help in:</p>
<ul>
<li>extrapolation of a consistent “core” (and corresponding utility function) from inconsistent <em>human</em> preferences (which could then inform an AI’s decisions)</li>
<li>adjustment of an <em>AI’s</em> inconsistent preferences (either by engineers or by the AI itself), with a minimum of changes being made</li>
</ul>
<p>We have not yet implemented this process for removing curl. But we believe that the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmholtz_decomposition"">Helmholtz theorem</a> should work, at least for PVFs in 3 or fewer dimensions (and we believe that a higher dimensional generalization probably exists). The Helmholtz theorem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>states that any sufficiently smooth, rapidly decaying vector field in three dimensions can be resolved into the sum of an irrotational (curl-free) vector field and a solenoidal (divergence-free) vector field; this is known as the Helmholtz decomposition or Helmholtz representation. (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmholtz_decomposition"">Wikipedia</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This irrotational (curl-free) vector field would then be the consistent projection (in a <a href=""https://intelligence.org/files/CEV.pdf"">CEV</a>-like way) of the agent’s preferences (from which the agent’s utility function could also be generated, in the manner discussed earlier).</p>
<h1>Uncertainties and areas for further research</h1>
<p>The following are some areas we are particularly interested in getting comments/feedback on, seeing others explore, or exploring ourselves in future work:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are there any flaws or misleading elements in the above analysis? (As noted earlier, this is essentially just an initial exploration of some tools/concepts.)</li>
<li>To what extent do the methods used and claims made in this post generalise to higher-dimensional spaces (e.g., when we wish to represent preferences over more than two factors at the same time)? To what extent do they generalise to graphs of states that don’t correspond to any normal geometry?</li>
<li>Is there an existing, rigorous/precise method for extrapolating a PVF from a limited number of known preferences (or more generally, extrapolating a vector field from a limited number of known vectors)? If not, can a satisfactorily rigorous/precise method be developed?</li>
<li>Are there meaningful and relevant differences between the concepts of curl in vector fields and of intransitivity, inconsistency, irrationality, and incoherence in preferences? If so, how does that change the above analysis?</li>
<li>Is it possible to “remove curl” in the way we want, in the sort of situations we’re interested in (in particular, not only in three dimensions)? If so, how, specifically?</li>
<li>What other implications do the above ideas have? E.g., for rationality more generally, or for how to interpret and implement preference utilitarianism. (Above, I mostly just introduced the ideas, and hinted at a handful of implications.)</li>
<li>What other uses could these “tools” be put to?</li>

The network, having each  set of observations labeled with the respective gas they came from,  learns how that gas behaves, and build its own equivalent of the magic  number R, b and a into it&#x2019;s weights and biases.</p><p>For one, this would wreak havoc in our education system, people could  no longer be expected to know the Van der Waals equation and solve it  on a blackboard for a given a, b and R. If we did this for all the  &#x201C;laws&#x201D; of physics people might even start questioning why they have to  learn this silly &#x201C;math&#x201D; contraption to being with, since all they are  doing is feeding variables into a computer.</p><p>But on more steel-man-ish note, one would argue that this approach  would stifle the progress of science. Since, after all, one can look at  the Van der Waals equation and infer two things:</p><p>a) How you could come up with a better equation.</p><p>b) What data one would need to gather for that equation to be  relevant, based on the places where the Van der Waals equation seems to  produce results which &#x201C;look odd&#x201D; or conflict with experimental data.</p><h2>Can we distill the role of humans in science to data-gatherers?</h2><p>Humans are great platforms for interacting with the physical reality  around them; we&#x2019;ve had billions of years to optimize us to do things  such as grabbing, pouring, slashing, smashing and moving in an  incomprehensibly large range of environments. I would never dare argue  with this point and I think people building humanoid robots are  basically up against an almost impossible task (though I am often amazed  by their achievements).</p><p>What I would argue is that humans might not be that good at doing  math. If there was any evolutionary pressure to do math, it came very  recently into our development. People that can intuitively do movements  which a bleeding-edge robot couldn&#x2019;t dream of, fail at the most basic of  mathematical tasks which the tiny computer inside my fridge would find  laughably easy.</p><p>Yet for some reason people are adamant about constructing mathematical models to explain the data they observe in nature.</p><p>But presently there&#x2019;s almost no examples of a task that requires  numbers as inputs, and has numbers as outputs, where dozens of years of  human brain work can match machine learning models.</p><p>If we look at something like protein folding: the hot-topic nowadays  is not if machine learning models can beat carefully crafted algorithms  based on &#x201C;domain specific&#x201D; human logic; it is how little data they need  and how fast they can do it.</p><p>Based on my readings, there&#x2019;s ample proof that the answer to both of  those is &#x201C;very little&#x201D; (e.g.  https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01357-6).</p><p>The main issue in most fields, however, is that head-to-head  comparison of human-made models vs machine learning models is  impossible. Since the way science progresses is not by carefully  collection and STORING data, it&#x2019;s by collecting data, creating  human-made models that explain the data, calling the almost-perfect  models fact and then forgetting about the actual data.</p><p>I can&#x2019;t stress how important this point is, think back to any course  in physics, chemistry or biology you took and at what was discussed.  Where you ever shown the data based on which we construct the picture of  the underlying reality ? Or where you mainly focusing on equations and  assuming those equations are equivalent to looking at the raw data.</p><p>This leads me into the above points a) and b). Namely the fact that  human-made models are better because other humans can look at them and  figure out where they are wrong and what data to collect in order to  come up with better models.</p><p>I will concede that this is often true, but it&#x2019;s true because we have  a flawed epistemic perspective. In order for a machine learning model  to be better than a string-theorist, it would have to understand string  theory and then make some &#x201C;discovery&#x201D; (read: a mathematical model) that  agrees with experiments previously unexplained by string theory.</p><p>However this mindset in itself is lacking, because the human models  are flawed and the data that the models were built on is often not  easily accessible, if at all. </p><p>Even when the underlying data is accessible, it&#x2019;s usually accessible  having passed through several layer of flawed human abstraction.</p><p>The result of the experiments are interpreted and stored using high level human made abstractions. </p><p>For example, we could store the results of an experiment in two different ways:</p><ul><li>1. Using {power source} aimed for {time} at {material 1} we  propelled particles from it into {material 2} we observed (using an  electronic microscope) the effects on the crystalline lattice on x  samples of {material 2}, here&#x2019;s those images.</li><li>2. We hit {material 2} with {y} electrons at {parameters  describing the energy/momentum of the electrons} and observed that it&#x2019;s  lattice switched from { abstraction 1 describing crystalline lattice} to  {abstraction 2 describing crystalline lattice}.</li></ul><p>Something like variant 2 is probably better if a physicist looking at  the data, but maybe a &#x201C;lower level&#x201D; interpretation such as 1 would be  better suited for an automated data-interpretation algorithm.</p><p>That&#x2019;s not to say abstraction 2 is inherently worse than abstraction  1, indeed, if you go down the deconstructionist path and break down the  abstractions used to understand the world as far down as you can&#x2026; you  end up nowhere, you end up in a philosophical void arguing with Kant and  Hume about whether or not we can truly state or know anything.</p><p>I agree that any abstraction that can be designed will be flawed in  some sense, but the flaws we design into our abstractions, are  specifically designed by humans for humans. I think that it&#x2019;s very  plausible to say that if we instead designed the abstractions with  automated algorithms in mind as their users (or let said algorithms  design them) we might end up with some pretty different abstractions. </p><p>If all you have to go by are flawed models, rather than raw data,  then a human might well do better at creating slightly less flawed  models, not because humans are better model creators, but because humans  understand the &#x201C;context&#x201D; in which those models where created.</p><p>In the few cases where easy to work with data is available to feed  into a model, such as is the case with predicting folding from peptide  structure, models often do better. But even in those cases, I&#x2019;d argue  that we disadvantage the models because they can only work with the data  we provide them; they can&#x2019;t ask us to provide different data, they  can&#x2019;t design their own abstractions and ask to receive data interpreted  using those abstractions.</p><p>Our process of data gathering in itself is flawed from a ML-driven  perspective, because we don&#x2019;t design our models in such a way as to  understand the type of data they would need to make better predictions.</p><p>I think this flaw stems from two directions. </p><p>One, the concept of ML models making inferences about the type of  data they need is heavily underdeveloped. In the last year, part of my  job has been tackling this very problem of models that analyze  models/themselves, and I will admit I was rather surprised at the lack  of research on the topic even at a fundamental level (e.g. making neural  networks give a certainty for a prediction or determine the importance  of a feature). The closest one can get to serious researchers tackling  this problem is reinforcement learning, but it&#x2019;s not clear whether those  approaches would lend themselves well to the real world, where the cost  of exploration is very high&#x2026; it&#x2019;s much cheaper for a model to play  millions of DOTA2 games to get better at DOTA2, than for a model to  dictate millions of hadron collider experiments to get better at  physics.</p><p>Two, we are reluctant to change our approach to science to a more  data-driven one. I think the idea of machine learning models dictating  to scientists what kind of data they should collect is far-fetched, but I  think part of why it is far-fetched is because we intuitively know that  no scientist will want to be reduced to a simple data collector.</p><p>This is a cat and mouse argument, &#x201C;no models that are good at  figuring out what data they need are made because no humans want to do  the data-gathering&#x201D; and &#x201C;no humans want to do model-driven data  gathering because no models exist that are good at figuring out what  data they need.&#x201D;</p><p>An easier requirement would be to properly index and store all the  data that leads to a human-made model and properly index and store all  the data that leads to the models that lead to the models upon which the  human-made model is designed, and so on. But even this is too much to  ask, because often the old data is lost, it&#x2019;s not digitized and it&#x2019;s  compressed in a lossy way. The experimental results might be recorded  somewhere, but details about how the experiment was run are lost, or  were never even recorded, because they were too complex for a human-made  model to take into account.</p><p>However, what would be easy to do is play in good faith with machine  learning models and do our best to at least store and properly index all  data from current experiments and observations.</p><p>But maybe I&#x2019;m being unfair to physics here; after all I have a poor  understanding of modern physics, to my knowledge experimental physicists  are actually doing their best in the modern world to store the data  from their experiments and storing all the data from physics experiments  is actually a complicated task; since the inception of CERN it has  produced literally Exabytes of data.</p><p>Instead, let me harp on a field that&#x2019;s much easier to criticize: medical research.</p><h2>Are we actively hindering ML algorithms from competing with us ?</h2><p>If you go into topics like cancer detection, I sometime feel like  what&#x2019;s currently going on is basically a charade in order to justify  still using human-based assessments rather than algorithmic assessments.</p><p>There&#x2019;s an abject lack of human vs algorithm-based detection trials  and the few reviews that do take a comparative look at the issue.

The pooled specificity  was 93&#xB7;9% (92&#xB7;2&#x2013;95&#xB7;3) for deep learning algorithms and 88&#xB7;1% (82&#xB7;8&#x2013;91&#xB7;9)  for health-care professionals.<br> </blockquote><p>This is looking at an aggregate result over many conditions being  diagnosed. As far as I understand the physicians and the models are not  even always using the same dataset for testing.</p><p>Still, I think the results seem to be basically very promising,  especially when you only consider the highest specificity &amp;  sensitivity ML algorithms, especially when you consider they would cost  us a few cents and hour to run, whereas doctors cost us anywhere from 10  to 300$ an hour. Especially when you consider that this could be  deployed in areas that have no access to specialized doctors to being  with.</p><blockquote>Only four studies provided health-care professionals with  additional clinical information, as they would have in clinical  practice; one study also tested the scenario in which prior or  historical imaging was provided to the algorithm and the health-care  professional, and four studies also considered diagnostic performance in  an algorithm-plus-clinician scenario. It is worth noting that no  studies reported a formal sample size calculation to ensure that the  study was sufficiently sized in a head-to-head comparison.<br> </blockquote><p>I wonder why so few studies provided direct comparison with doctors,  considering that most researcher I know of are delighted to test their  models against some real-world benchmarks, I think it&#x2019;s not unreasonable  to speculate something along the lines of: &#x201C;No group of  oncologists/radiologists are heavily invested in running trials of  themselves versus the best known machine learning models that would  serve to replace their work.&quot;</p><p>Even more so, looking at review of various individual model models  (e.g.  https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2001037014000464) you  can very easily see that the amount of data they use is laughable,  often as low as a few dozens of examples.</p><p>Consider the fact that 37 million mammograms are performed each year  in the US. We&#x2019;ve had at least 5 years since the idea that a CNN could  detect cancer from medical images had strong footing. Assuming as little  as 20% of those mammograms had 1-5 year follow-up, that&#x2019;s bound to be a  dataset of at least 37 million examples of images connected with a  breast-cancer diagnosis. Indeed, if we expand this to all countries rich  enough to produce sizable amounts of such data, this numbers should be  in the hundreds of millions.</p><p>Yet the largest claimed dataset (from this paper: <a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.08297v1.pdf"">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.08297v1.pdf</a>).  Contains only 1.2 million images and is proprietary. The single model  that was tried on this dataset claims to perform about as well as a  radiologist. But imagine if we didn&#x2019;t have only 1.2 million images,  imagine if we had over 100 million and image if we didn&#x2019;t have a single  model, imagine if we had hundreds of them, if we didn&#x2019;t have a single  team but rather hundreds of teams working on this problem. </p><p>To me that seems like something that has so much potential it&#x2019;s  appalling that we aren&#x2019;t doing it. After all the end result would save  billions of taxpayer dollars in terms of salaries and followup  procedures, prevent a sad end to countless life (often on relatively  young people, since breast cancer is frequent in young demographics  compared to other types of cancer) and help with early detection,  possibly preventing mentally and physically scaring procedures such as  mastectomies and long-term aggressive chemotherapy.</p><p>So, again, my question is:</p><ul><li>Why is a hospital nearby me not running a trial on this algorithm ?</li><li>Why is not all the data for tackling this issue publicly available ?</li><li>Why is nobody talking about these things not happening ?</li></ul><h2>In conclusion</h2><p>I&#x2019;m not claiming there&#x2019;s some evil organization of scientists or  doctors actively plotting against machine learning models that can  replace them.</p><p>Most of scientists and doctors are nice people that want the  advancement of their fields to continue, even if that means they might  have to work on less of the stuff they consider to be &#x201C;fun&#x201D;.</p><p>The problem is systemic: bad regulations are keeping the public from  accessing useful data; bad allotment of funds and bad coordination means  we don&#x2019;t get the centralized data stores we should have. Bad practices  mean that scientists and doctors are actively discouraged from taking a  data-driven approach, where their main role is accurately producing,  labeling and storing data&#x2026; when was the last Nobel prize in medicine  awarded to someone that put together a large and easy to use database  for diagnosing DVT risk?</p><p>But I do think that there&#x2019;s a very good reason to intuit that the  task of building models of the world, especially mathematical models,  might be better accomplished if we focused more on giving it to an ML  model rather than a brain; that brilliant scientists dreaming up complex  equations to explain experiments might often be a bad approach to  creating ML models that learn to fit well-collected data. That doctors  looking for anomalies in images their brain wasn&#x2019;t design to perceive  might be worst-off than a CNN classifier designed and trained for  detecting that specific anomaly.</p><p>I also think that our inherent bias for man-created models rather  than machine-created models is dictating a lot of the data gathering we  do. In turn, his bias is dictating the kind of machine learning models  we build, or rather making us uninterested in building more  well-integrated models that concern themselves not only with making  predictions about the data we&#x2019;ve given them, but also about the kind of  data we should be collecting to improve them. </p><p>The sooner we internalize the large possibility that we already have  tools much better than our brains for creating a mathematical model from  data, the sooner we&#x2019;ll start seeing the value of data over models, and  the sooner we&#x2019;ll start seeing the value of properly wording a problem as  opposed to just building a model that solves an ill-constructed  problem.</p><p>Finally, I don&#x2019;t necessarily have a solution for this, nor am I  claiming that what I&#x2019;m saying in this article is &#x201C;obviously true&#x201D;. I  think I&#x2019;ve taken the perspective of &#x201C;machine learning is always better  than humans at fitting equations on data&#x201D; partially as a given; granted,  I did give two examples of this seemingly being the case, but I don&#x2019;t  expect to significantly shift your perspective towards my view here.</p><p>What I&#x2019;ve hopefully done is give a bit more context on the idea that  humans might be &#x201C;too focused&#x201D; on building abstractions and equations, as  opposed to building models that will build those abstractions and  equations for us. I should have probably added more examples and more  caveats, but I&#x2019;m not hoping to dictate global scientific policy with  this blog, I&#x2019;m just hoping to offer interesting perspectives to ponder. I  am not certain of this view, it&#x2019;s one hypothesis playing around in my  mind which I found interesting and did my best to share.</p>",George3d6,george3d6,George3d6,
pfaTqpWFghfrbvzaD,Assortative Mating And Autism,assortative-mating-and-autism,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/pfaTqpWFghfrbvzaD/assortative-mating-and-autism,2020-01-28T18:20:02.223Z,50,15,2,False,False,,"<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>Assortative mating is when similar people marry and have children. Some people worry about assortative mating in Silicon Valley: highly analytical tech workers marry other highly analytical tech workers. If highly analytical tech workers have more autism risk genes than the general population, assortative mating could put their children at very high risk of autism. How concerned should this make us?</p>
<p><b>Methods / Sample Characteristics</b></p>
<p>I used the 2020 Slate Star Codex survey to investigate this question. It had 8,043 respondents selected for being interested in a highly analytical blog about topics like science and economics. The blog is associated with – and draws many of its readers from – the rationalist and effective altruist movements, both highly analytical. More than half of respondents worked in programming, engineering, math, or physics. 79% described themselves as atheist or agnostic. 65% described themselves as more interested in STEM than the humanities; only 15% said the opposite.</p>
<p>According to <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30478241"">Kogan et al (2018)</a>, about 2.5% of US children are currently diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders. The difference between “autism” and “autism spectrum disorder” is complicated, shifts frequently, and is not very well-known to the public; this piece will treat them interchangeably from here on. There are no surveys of what percent of adults are diagnosed with autism; it is probably lower since most diagnoses happen during childhood and the condition was less appreciated in past decades. These numbers may be affected by parents’ education level and social class; <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3086778/#!po=54.7619"">one study</a> shows that children in wealthy neighborhoods were up to twice as likely to get diagnosed as poorer children.</p>
<p>Given that respondents are likely wealthier than average, we might expect a rate of 2.5% – 5%. Instead the rate is noticeably higher than that, consistent with the hypothesis that this sample will be more autistic than average. About 4% of the SSC survey sample had a formal diagnosis of autism, but this rose to 6% when the sample was limited to people below 30, and to 8% below 20. This sample is plausibly about 2-3x more autistic than the US population. Childhood social class was not found to have a significant effect on autism status in this sample.</p>
<p><b>Results</b></p>
<p>I tried to get information on how many children respondents have, but I forgot to ask important questions about age until a quarter of the way through the survey. I want to make sure I’m only catching children old enough that their autism would have been diagnosed, so the information below (except when otherwise noted) comes from the three-quarters of the sample where I have good age information. I also checked it against the whole sample and it didn’t make a difference.</p>
<p>Of this limited sample, 1,204 individual parents had a total of 2,459 children. 1,892 of those children were older than 3, and 1,604 were older than 5. I chose to analyze children older than 3, since autism generally becomes detectable around 2.</p>
<p>71 children in the 1,892 child sample had formal diagnoses of autism, for a total prevalence of 3.7%. When parents were asked to include children who were not formally diagnosed but who they thought had the condition, this increased to 99 children, or a 5.2% prevalence. Both numbers are much lower than the 8% prevalence in young people in the sample.</p>
<p>What about marriages where both partners were highly analytical? My proxy for this was the following survey question:</p>
<p><img src=""http://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/autismquestion.png"" /></p>
<p>I’ll be referring to these answers as “yes”, “sort of”, and “no” from here on, and moving back to the full sample. 938 parents answered this question; 51 (5.4%) yes, 233 (24.8%) sort of, and 653 (69.4%) no. Keep in mind the effective sample is even smaller, since both partners in two-partners-read-SSC-families may have filled out the survey individually about the same set of children (though this should not have affected the “sort of” group). Here is the autism rate for each group, with 95% confidence interval in black:</p>
<p><img src=""http://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/autismgraphs.png"" /></p>
<p>There is little difference. If we combine the latter two groups, the confidence interval narrows slightly, to 2.7 – 6.5.</p>
<p>I asked respondents about the severity of their children’s autism. </p>
<p><img src=""http://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/autismseverity.png"" /></p>
<p>People who hadn’t previously reported any children with autism gave answers other than N/A for this one, which was confusing. Instead of the 71 children we had before, now it’s up to 144 children. I’m not sure what’s going on here. Of these phantom children, 101 had mild cases, 31 moderate, and only 12 severe. Severe autism was only present in 0.6% of the children in the sample. There was no tendency for couples where both partners were highly analytical to have children with more severe autism.</p>
<p><b>Discussion</b></p>
<p>Autism rates in this survey were generally low. Although the general rate of 3.7% was higher than the commonly-estimated US base rate of 2.5%, this is consistent with the slight elevation of autism observed in higher social classes.</p>
<p>There was no sign of elevated risk when both partners were highly analytical. The sample size was too small to say for certain that no such elevation exists, but it can say with 95% confidence that the elevated risk is less than three percentage points.</p>
<p>This suggests that the answer to the original question – does assortative mating between highly analytical people significantly increase chance of autism in offspring – is at least a qualified “no”.</p>
<p>Why should this be? It could just be that regression to the mean is more important in this case than any negative effects from combining recessive genes or mixing too many risk genes together. Or maybe we should challenge the assumption that being a highly analytical programmer is necessarily on a continuum with autism. It seems like p(highly analytical|on autism spectrum) is pretty high, but p(on autism spectrum|is highly analytical) might be much lower.</p>
<p>Obvious limitations of this survey include the small sample size of both-partners-highly-analytical couples, the weak operationalization of highly analytical as “member of the SSC, rationalist, and effective altruist communities”, and the inability to separate non-autistic children from children who are not yet diagnosed. Due to these limitations, this should only be viewed as providing evidence against the strongest versions of the assortative mating hypothesis, where it might increase risk by double, triple, or more. Smaller elevations of risk remain plausible and would require larger studies to assess.</p>

</style></head><body><p>tl;dr: <em>There are ways of ensuring an agent doesn't have a large impact, by giving an impact penalty. One such penalty is ""attainable utility"", which measures its ""power"" by how much it could optimise certain reward functions. But in many circumstances, the agent can build a subagent, without triggering the impact penalty, and then that subagent can become very powerful and optimise the world, still without triggering the impact penalty.</em></p>
<h1>Attainable utility definitions</h1>
<p>There's been a long history of trying to penalise an AI for having a large impact on the world. To do that, you need an impact measure. I've designed <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10720"">some myself</a>, back in the day, but they only worked in narrow circumstances and required tricks to get anything useful at all out from them.</p>
<p>A more promising general method is <a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.09725.pdf"">attainable utility</a>. The idea is that, as an agent accumulates power in the world, they increase their ability to affect a lot of different things, and could therefore achieve a lot of different goals.</p>
<p>So, if an agent starts off unable to achieve many goals, but suddenly it can achieve a lot, that's a strong hint that its power has greatly increased.</p>
<p>Thus the impact measure is how much difference an agent's action does to its ability to achieve any of a large class of reward functions.

It has this preamble (~700 words), a short version / summary (~1.6k words), and a long version (~8.3k words). It is available as a Google Doc <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fng1J_QPb7GEeLBMmWWfZOguw7yUTZot0egrCbKpVwk/edit#"">here</a>.</p><p>There are many areas of work that are relevant to AI alignment that I have barely touched on, such as interpretability, uncertainty estimation, adversarial examples, and assured autonomy, primarily because I have not been following these fields and wouldn&#x2019;t be able to write a good summary of what has happened in them. I have also mostly focused on articles that provide some conceptual insight, and excluded or briefly linked to papers that primarily make quantitative improvements on important metrics. While such papers are obviously important (ultimately, our techniques need to work <em>well</em>), there isn&#x2019;t much to say about them in a yearly review other than that the quantitative metric was improved.</p><p>Despite these exclusions, there was still a ton of work to select from, perhaps around ~500 articles, of which over 300 have been linked to in this post. There are many interesting articles that I really enjoyed that get only a sentence of description, in which I ignore many of the points that the article makes. Most have been summarized in the <a href=""https://rohinshah.com/alignment-newsletter"">Alignment Newsletter</a>, so if you&#x2019;d like to learn more about any particular link, but don&#x2019;t want to read the entire thing, just search for its title in the <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PwWbWZ6FPqAgZWOoOcXM8N_tUCuxpEyMbN1NYYC02aM/edit#gid=0"">database</a>.</p><h4>What you should know about the structure of this post</h4><p>I am <em>not</em> speaking for myself; by default I am trying to explain what has been said, in a way that the authors of the articles would agree with. Any extra opinion that I add will be in italics.</p><p>As a post, this is meant to be read sequentially, but the underlying structure is a graph (nodes are posts, edges connect posts that are very related). I arranged it in a sequence that highlights the most salient-to-me connections. This means that the order in which I present subtopics is very much <em>not</em> a reflection of what I think is most important in AI safety: in my presentation order, I focused on <em>edges</em> (connections) rather than <em>nodes</em> (subtopics).</p><p>Other minor details:</p><ol><li>Any links from earlier than 2018 will have their year of publication right after the link (except for articles that were reposted as part of Alignment Forum sequences).</li><li>I typically link to blog posts; in several cases there is also an associated paper that I have not linked.</li></ol><h4>How to read this post</h4><p>I have put the most effort into making the prose of the long version read smoothly. The hierarchical organization is comparatively less coherent; this is partly because I optimized the prose, and partly because AI safety work is hard to cluster. As a result, for those willing to put in the effort, I&#x2019;d recommend reading the long version directly, without paying too much attention to the hierarchy. If you have less time, or are less interested in the minutiae of AI alignment research, the short version is for you.</p><p>Since I don&#x2019;t name authors or organizations, you may want to take this as your opportunity to form beliefs about which arguments in AI alignment are important based on the ideas (as opposed to based on trust in the author of the post).</p><p>People who keep up with AI alignment work might want to know which posts I&#x2019;m referencing as they read, which is a bit hard since I don&#x2019;t name the posts in the text. If this describes you, you should be reading this post on the Alignment Forum, where you can hover over most links to see what they link to. Alternatively, the <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fng1J_QPb7GEeLBMmWWfZOguw7yUTZot0egrCbKpVwk/edit#heading=h.kr223qj1g1y5"">references section in the Google Doc</a> lists all links in the order that they appear in the post, along with the hierarchical organization, and so you can open the references in a new tab, and read through the post and the references together.</p><p>I expect that if you aren&#x2019;t already familiar with them, some articles will sound crazy from my summary here; please read at least the newsletter summary and ideally the full article before arguing that it&#x2019;s crazy.</p><h4>Acknowledgements</h4><p>Thanks to the <a href=""https://rohinshah.com/alignment-newsletter"">Alignment Newsletter team</a>, Ben Pace, Oliver Habryka, Jonathan Uesato, Tom Everitt, Luke Muehlhauser, Jan Leike, Rob Bensinger, Adam Gleave, Scott Emmons, Rachel Freedman, Andrew Critch, Victoria Krakovna, and probably a few others (I really should have kept better track of this). Thanks especially to Ben Pace for suggesting that I write this review in the first place.</p><h1>Short version (~1.6k words)</h1><p>While the full text tries to accurately summarize different points of view, that is not a goal in this summary. Here I simply try to give a sense of the topics involved in the discussion, without saying what discussion actually happened.</p><p><strong>Basic analysis of AI risk.</strong> Traditional arguments for AI risk argue that since agentic AI systems will apply lots of optimization, they will lead to extreme outcomes that can&#x2019;t be handled with normal engineering efforts. Powerful AI systems will not have their resources stolen from them, which by various dutch book theorems implies that they must be expected utility maximizers; since expected utility maximizers are goal-directed, they are dangerous.</p><p>However, the VNM theorem <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/4dHMdK5TLN6xcqtyc/p/NxF5G6CJiof6cemTw"">does not justify</a> the assumption that an AI system will be goal-directed: such an assumption is really based on intuitions and conceptual arguments (which are still quite strong).</p><p><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/x3fNwSe5aWZb5yXEG/reframing-superintelligence-comprehensive-ai-services-as"">Comprehensive AI Services</a> (CAIS) challenges the assumption that we will have a single agentic AI, instead suggesting that any task will be performed by a collection of modular services.</p><p>That being said, there are several other arguments for AI risk, such as the <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/w6d7XBCegc96kz4n3/the-argument-from-philosophical-difficulty"">argument</a> that AI might cause &#x201C;lock in&#x201D; which may require us to solve hard philosophical problems before the development of AGI.</p><p>Nonetheless, there are <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/QknPz9JQTQpGdaWDp/an-80-why-ai-risk-might-be-solved-without-additional"">disjunctive reasons</a> to expect that catastrophe does not occur: for example, there may not be a problem, or ML researchers may solve the problem after we get &#x201C;warning shots&#x201D;, or we could coordinate to not build unaligned AI.</p><p><strong>Agency and optimization.</strong> One proposed problem is that of <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/r9tYkB2a8Fp4DN8yB"">mesa optimization</a>, in which an optimization algorithm used to train an AI creates an agent that is <em>itself</em> performing optimization. In such a scenario, we need to ensure that the &#x201C;inner&#x201D; optimization is also aligned.</p><p>To better understand these and other situations, it would be useful to have a formalization of optimization. This is <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/26eupx3Byc8swRS7f/bottle-caps-aren-t-optimisers"">hard</a>: while we don&#x2019;t want optimization to be about our beliefs about a system, if we try to define it mechanistically, it becomes hard to avoid defining a bottle cap as an optimizer of &#x201C;water kept in the bottle&#x201D;.</p><p>Understanding agents is another hard task. While agents are relatively well understood under the Cartesian assumption, where the agent is separate from its environment, things become much more complex and poorly-understood when the agent is a <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/Rm6oQRJJmhGCcLvxh"">part of its environment</a>.</p><p><strong>Value learning.</strong> Building an AI that learns all of human value has historically been thought to be very hard, because it requires you to decompose human behavior into the &#x201C;beliefs and planning&#x201D; part and the &#x201C;values&#x201D; part, and there&#x2019;s no clear way to do this.</p><p>Another way of looking at it is to say that value learning <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/4dHMdK5TLN6xcqtyc/p/h9DesGT3WT9u2k7Hr"">requires</a> a model that separates the given data into that which actually achieves the true &#x201C;values&#x201D; and that which is just &#x201C;a mistake&#x201D;, which seems hard to do. In addition, value learning seems quite fragile to mis-specification of this human model.</p><p>Nonetheless, there are reasons for optimism. We could try to build an <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/CSEdLLEkap2pubjof/research-agenda-v0-9-synthesising-a-human-s-preferences-into""><em>adequate</em> utility function</a>, which works well enough for our purposes. We can also have <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/nd692YfFGfZDh9Mwz/an-69-stuart-russell-s-new-book-on-why-we-need-to-replace""><em>uncertainty</em> over the utility function</a>, and update the belief over time based on human behavior. If everything is specified correctly (a big if), as time goes on, the agent would become more and more aligned with human values. One major benefit of this is that it is <em>interactive</em> -- it doesn&#x2019;t require us to specify everything perfectly ahead of time.</p><p><strong>Robustness.</strong> We would like our agents to be robust - that is, they shouldn&#x2019;t fail catastrophically in situations slightly different from the ones they were designed for. Within reinforcement learning, safe reinforcement learning aims to avoid mistakes, even during training. This either requires analytical (i.e. not trial-and-error) reasoning about what a &#x201C;mistake&#x201D; is, which requires a formal specification of what a mistake is, or an overseer who can correct the agent before it makes a mistake.</p><p>The classic example of a failure of robustness is adversarial examples, in which a tiny change to an image can drastically affect its classification. Recent research has shown that these examples are <a href=""https://distill.pub/2019/advex-bugs-discussion/"">caused</a> (at least in part) by real statistical correlations that generalize to the test set, that are nonetheless fragile to small changes. In addition, since robustness to one kind of adversary doesn&#x2019;t make the classifier robust to other kinds of adversaries, there has been a lot of work done on improving adversarial evaluation in image classification. We&#x2019;re also seeing some of this work in reinforcement learning.</p><p>However, asking our agents to be robust to arbitrary mistakes seems to be too much -- humans certainly don&#x2019;t meet this bar. For AI safety, it seems like we need to ensure that our agents are robustly <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/EmDuGeRw749sD3GKd/p/ZeE7EKHTFMBs8eMxn"">intent aligned</a>, that is, they are always &#x201C;trying&#x201D; to do what we want. One particular way that our agents could be intent aligned is if they are <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/EmDuGeRw749sD3GKd/p/fkLYhTQteAu5SinAc"">corrigible</a>, that is, they are trying to keep us &#x201C;in control&#x201D;. This seems like a particularly easy property to verify, as conceptually it seems to be independent of the domain in which the agent is deployed.</p><p>So, we would like to ensure that even in the worst case, our agent remains corrigible. One <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/9Dy5YRaoCxH9zuJqa/relaxed-adversarial-training-for-inner-alignment"">proposal</a> would be to train an adversary to search for &#x201C;relaxed&#x201D; situations in which the agent behaves incorrigibly, and then train the agent not to do that.</p><p><strong>Scaling to superhuman abilities.</strong> If we&#x2019;re building corrigible agents using adversarial training, our adversary should be more capable than the agent that it is training, so that it can find all the situations in which the agent behaves incorrigibly. This requires techniques that scale to superhuman abilities. Some techniques for this include <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/EmDuGeRw749sD3GKd"">iterated amplification</a> and <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00899"">debate</a>.</p><p>In iterated amplification, we start with an initial policy, and alternate between amplification and distillation, which increase capabilities and efficiency respectively. This can encode a range of algorithms, but often amplification is done by decomposing questions and using the agent to answer subquestions, and distillation can be done using supervised learning or reinforcement learning.</p><p>In debate, we train an agent through self-play in a zero-sum game in which the agent&#x2019;s goal is to &#x201C;win&#x201D; a question-answering debate, as evaluated by a human judge. The hope is that since each &#x201C;side&#x201D; of the debate can point out flaws in the other side&#x2019;s arguments, such a setup can use a human judge to train far more capable agents while still incentivizing them to provide honest, true information.</p><p>Both iterated amplification and debate aim to train an agent that approximates the answer that one would get from an exponentially large tree of humans deliberating. The <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/EmDuGeRw749sD3GKd/p/DFkGStzvj3jgXibFG"">factored cognition</a> hypothesis is that this sort of tree of humans is able to do any task we care about. This hypothesis is controversial: many have the intuition that cognition requires large contexts and flashes of intuition that couldn&#x2019;t be replicated by a tree of time-limited humans.</p><p><strong>Universality.</strong> One <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/M8WdeNWacMrmorNdd/towards-formalizing-universality"">property</a> we would hope to have is that if we use this tree of humans as an overseer for some simpler agent, then the tree would &#x201C;know everything the agent knows&#x201D;. If true, this property could allow us to build a significantly stronger conceptual argument for safety. It is also very related to&#x2026;</p><p><strong>Interpretability.</strong> While interpretability can help us know what the agent knows, and what the agent would do in other situations (which can help us verify if it is corrigible), there are <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/X2i9dQQK3gETCyqh2/chris-olah-s-views-on-agi-safety"">other uses</a> for it as well: in general, it seems better if we can understand the things we&#x2019;re building.</p><p><strong>Impact regularization.</strong> While relative reachability and attainable utility preservation were developed last year, this year saw them be <a href=""https://medium.com/@deepmindsafetyresearch/designing-agent-incentives-to-avoid-side-effects-e1ac80ea6107"">unified</a> into a single framework. In addition, there was a new proposed <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/7CdoznhJaLEKHwvJW"">definition</a> of impact: change in our ability to get what we want. This notion of impact depends on knowing the utility function U. However, we might hope that we can penalize some &#x201C;objective&#x201D; notion, perhaps &quot;power&quot;, that occurs regardless of the choice of U, for the same reasons that we expect instrumental convergence.</p><p><strong>Causal modeling.</strong> Causal models have been used recently to <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08663"">model</a> the incentives for an agent under different AI safety frameworks, and to <a href=""https://medium.com/@deepmindsafetyresearch/designing-agent-incentives-to-avoid-reward-tampering-4380c1bb6cd"">argue</a> that by evaluating plans with the current reward function, you can remove the incentive for an agent to tamper with its reward function.</p><p><strong>Oracles.</strong> Even if oracles are trying to maximize predictive accuracy, they could &#x201C;choose&#x201D; between different self-confirming predictions.

This approach (recently discussed in the post and comments <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/mdau2DBSMi5bWXPGA/useful-does-not-mean-secure"">here</a>) argues that since AI agents will be exerting a lot of optimization, there will be <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/zEvqFtT4AtTztfYC4/optimization-amplifies"">extreme outcomes</a> in which our regular arguments may not work. This implies that we must adopt a <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/8gqrbnW758qjHFTrH/security-mindset-and-ordinary-paranoia"">security mindset</a> (2017) to ensure alignment, and it suggests that proof-level guarantees may be <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/aPwNaiSLjYP4XXZQW/ai-alignment-open-thread-august-2019#3TKtFmF3ZcQFgQNsA"">more important</a> at various stages of alignment research.</p><h4>Goal-directedness</h4><p>The foundational writing then goes on to point out that since powerful AI systems should not be able to be dutch booked (i.e. have their resources stolen from them), they will be well <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/RQpNHSiWaXTvDxt6R/coherent-decisions-imply-consistent-utilities"">modeled</a> (2017) as expected utility maximisers.

This is suggesting that modularity across tasks is sufficiently useful that it will apply to AI, in the same way that it applies to humans (e.g. I have specialized in AI research, and not plumbing). The aggregate of all the services can accomplish any task, including the development of new services, making it comprehensive (analogous to the &#x201C;general&#x201D; in AGI). Since AI services can also do basic AI R&amp;D research, which leads to improvement in AI services generally, we should expect recursive <em>technological</em> improvement (as opposed to recursive <em>self</em> improvement). Note that CAIS does not necessarily suggest we will be <em>safe</em>, just that the traditional risks are not as likely as we may have thought, while other emergent risks are perhaps greater.</p><p><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/HvNAmkXPTSoA4dvzv/comments-on-cais"">Critics</a> <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/bXYtDfMTNbjCXFQPh/drexler-on-ai-risk"">often</a> <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/x3fNwSe5aWZb5yXEG/reframing-superintelligence-comprehensive-ai-services-as#sXHXAfSKWPyEMhtcu"">argue</a> that end-to-end training and integrated agent-like architectures are likely to (eventually) outperform modular services. However, through coordination services can also be integrated. In addition, this <a href=""https://www.overcomingbias.com/2019/02/how-lumpy-ai-services.html"">post</a> argues that this criticism mirrors old concerns that under capitalism firms will become too large -- a concern that the post argues did not pan out.</p><p>CAIS <em>does</em> allow for AI systems that are capable of <em>learning</em> across many domains: it simply argues that these AI systems will specialize for efficiency reasons, and so will only be <em>competent</em> at a small subset of domains.

It argues that accident risks in particular draw on fuzzy, intuitive concepts, haven&#x2019;t been engaged with much by critics, and don&#x2019;t sway most AI researchers.</p><p>Despite the seeming controversy in this and previous sections, it is worth noting that there is general agreement within the AI safety community on the following broader argument for work on AI safety:</p><ol><li>Superhuman agents are not <em>required</em> to treat humans well, in the same way that humans aren&#x2019;t required to treat gorillas well.</li><li>You should have a good <em>technical</em> reason to expect that superhuman agents <em>will</em> treat humans well.</li><li>We do not currently have such a reason.</li></ol><h1>Agency and optimization</h1><h2>Mesa optimization</h2><p>The problem of <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/r9tYkB2a8Fp4DN8yB"">mesa optimization</a> was explained in significantly more detail (see also this less formal <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/bG4PR9uSsZqHg2gYY/utility-reward"">summary</a>). In mesa optimization, we start with a <em>base optimizer</em> like gradient descent that searches for a policy that accomplishes some complex task. For sufficiently complex tasks, it seems likely that the best policy will <em>itself</em> be an optimizer. (Meta learning is explicitly trying to learn policies that are also optimizers.) However, the policy could be optimizing a different goal, called the <em>mesa objective</em>, rather than the <em>base objective</em>.</p><p>Optimizing the mesa objective must lead to good base objective behavior on the training distribution (else gradient descent would not select it), but could be arbitrarily bad when off distribution. For example, a plausible mesa objective would be to seek influence: such an agent would initially do what we want it to do (since otherwise we would shut it down), but might turn against us once it has accumulated enough power.</p><p>This decomposes the overall alignment problem into <em>outer alignment</em> (ensuring that the base objective is aligned with &#x201C;what we want&#x201D;) and <em>inner alignment</em> (ensuring that the mesa objective is aligned with the base objective). This is somewhat <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/yXPT4nr4as7JvxLQa/classifying-specification-problems-as-variants-of-goodhart-s"">analogous</a> to different <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/EbFABnst8LsidYs5Y/goodhart-taxonomy"">types</a> (2017) of Goodhart&#x2019;s law.</p><p>The paper and <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/iydwbZhATANhjoGP7/more-variations-on-pseudo-alignment"">subsequent</a> <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/uXH4r6MmKPedk8rMA/gradient-hacking"">analysis</a> identify and categorize relationships between the base and mesa objectives, and explain how mesa optimizers could fail catastrophically. Of particular interest is that mesa optimizers should be fast, but could still be misaligned, suggesting that <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/nyCHnY7T5PHPLjxmN/open-question-are-minimal-circuits-daemon-free"">penalizing compute</a> is <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/fM5ZWGDbnjb7ThNKJ/are-minimal-circuits-deceptive"">not enough</a> to solve inner alignment.</p><p>Effectively, the concern is that our AI systems will have capabilities that generalize, but objectives that <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/2mhFMgtAjFJesaSYR/2-d-robustness"">don&#x2019;t</a>. Since this is what drives risk, some <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/nFDXq7HTv9Xugcqaw/is-the-term-mesa-optimizer-too-narrow"">suggest</a> that we should talk about this phenomenon, without needing to bring in the baggage of &#x201C;optimization&#x201D;, a term we have yet to understand well, while others <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/zCcmJzbenAXu6qugS/tabooing-agent-for-prosaic-alignment"">argue</a> that even if we start with this definition, it would be useful to reintroduce the notions of optimization and agency.</p><p>One advantage of the original definition is that it specifies a particular mechanism by which risk arises; this gives us a foothold into the problem that allows us to propose <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/9Dy5YRaoCxH9zuJqa/relaxed-adversarial-training-for-inner-alignment"">potential</a> <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/Ca3sCRGfWvXvYC5YC/what-are-some-non-purely-sampling-ways-to-do-deep-rl"">solutions</a> <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/uSdPa9nrSgmXCtdKN/concrete-experiments-in-inner-alignment"">and</a> <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/AFdRGfYDWQqmkdhFq/a-simple-environment-for-showing-mesa-misalignment"">empirical</a> <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/2GycxikGnepJbxfHT/towards-an-empirical-investigation-of-inner-alignment"">investigations</a>. Of course, this is actively counterproductive if the risk arises by some <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/osxNg6yBCJ4ur9hpi/does-agent-like-behavior-imply-agent-like-architecture"">other mechanism</a>, but we might expect optimization to be especially likely because optimization algorithms are simple, and the phenomenon of <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/FRv7ryoqtvSuqBxuT/understanding-deep-double-descent"">double descent</a> <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/nGqzNC6uNueum2w8T/inductive-biases-stick-around"">suggests</a> that neural nets have an inductive bias towards simplicity.</p><h2>What are optimization and agency, anyway?</h2><p>Given the central importance of optimization to inner alignment and AI safety more broadly, we&#x2019;d like to be able to formalize it. However, it&#x2019;s not clear how to do so: while we want optimization to be about the <em>mechanical process</em> by which outcomes happen (as opposed to e.g. <em>our beliefs</em> about that process), we cannot simply say that X is an optimizer if it makes some quantity go up: by this definition, a <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/26eupx3Byc8swRS7f/bottle-caps-aren-t-optimisers"">bottle cap</a> would be an optimizer for &#x201C;keeping water in the bottle&apos;&apos;.</p><p>It is also relevant how the system <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/rvxcSc6wdcCfaX6GZ/two-senses-of-optimizer"">interacts</a> with its environment, rather than just being about whether some number is going up. The type of computation matters: while older models of optimization involve an agent that can search over possible actions and simulate their results, other optimization processes must <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/ZDZmopKquzHYPRNxq/selection-vs-control"">control</a> their environment without being able to simulate the consequences of their choice.</p><p>Our use of the word &#x201C;agency&#x201D; <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/ZigRhB4pAGdr6beQh/deconfuse-yourself-about-agency"">might</a> <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/4dHMdK5TLN6xcqtyc/p/DfcywmqRSkBaCB6Ma"">be</a> tied to our models or specific human architectures, rather than being a general concept that could describe a mechanical property of a computation. This would be particularly worrying since it would mean that arguments for AI risk are based on our flawed models of reality, rather than an objective property about reality. However, this is extremely speculative.</p><h2>Embedded agency</h2><p>Discussions about AI usually assume that a notion of the &#x201C;actions&#x201D; that an agent can take. However, the <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/Rm6oQRJJmhGCcLvxh"">embedded agency</a> sequence points out that this &#x201C;Cartesian boundary&#x201D; does not actually exist: since any real agent is embedded in the real world, you cannot make many assumptions that are common in reinforcement learning, such as dedicated and perfectly trusted input-output channels, a perfect model of the environment, an agent architecture that is uninfluenced by the environment, etc.</p><p>This means you can never consider all of the important information, and optimize everything that could be optimized. This has led to a couple of hypotheses:</p><ol><li>Real learning algorithms require <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/Ajcq9xWi2fmgn8RBJ/the-credit-assignment-problem"">modeling assumptions</a> to solve the credit assignment problem, and so can only lead to <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/4hdHto3uHejhY2F3Q/partial-agency"">partial agency</a> or <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/qpZTWb2wvgSt5WQ4H/defining-myopia"">myopia</a>.

Then, as an instrumental goal for maximizing expected reward, the AI will choose actions with high <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/Pkr97mB9Y4rkx5DdZ/utility-uncertainty-vs-expected-information-gain"">expected information gain</a>. While this was proposed <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03137"">earlier</a> (2016), the book <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Human-Compatible-Artificial-Intelligence-Problem-ebook/dp/B07N5J5FTS"">Human Compatible</a> (<a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/nd692YfFGfZDh9Mwz/an-69-stuart-russell-s-new-book-on-why-we-need-to-replace"">summary</a>, <a href=""https://futureoflife.org/2019/10/08/ai-alignment-podcast-human-compatible-artificial-intelligence-and-the-problem-of-control-with-stuart-russell/"">podcast 1</a>, <a href=""https://futureoflife.org/2019/01/17/cooperative-inverse-reinforcement-learning-with-dylan-hadfield-menell/"">podcast 2</a>, <a href=""https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/10/26/20932289/ai-stuart-russell-human-compatible"">interview</a>) explores the idea in much more detail than previous writing, and it has now <a href=""https://interactive-learning.github.io/"">made its way</a> into deep reinforcement learning as well.</p><p>Intuitively, since the AI is <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/4dHMdK5TLN6xcqtyc/p/ZiLLxaLB5CCofrzPp"">uncertain</a> about the true reward, it will behave conservatively and try to learn about the true reward, thus <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/PADPJ3xac5ogjEGwA/defeating-goodhart-and-the-closest-unblocked-strategy"">avoiding</a> Goodhart&#x2019;s law (see also <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/QJwnPRBBvgaeFeiLR/uncertainty-versus-fuzziness-versus-extrapolation-desiderata"">fuzziness</a>). Of course, once the AI has learned everything there is to learn, it will <a href=""https://arbital.com/p/updated_deference/"">behave</a> (2015?) just like a regular utility maximizer. In this setting, you would hope that the AI has <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/Pkr97mB9Y4rkx5DdZ/utility-uncertainty-vs-expected-information-gain#FGSgRJdrewhEGXRW9"">become aligned</a> with the true utility function, as long as its initial distribution over utility functions contains the truth, and the observation model by which its distribution is updated is &#x201C;correct&#x201D;. However, it might be <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/YJq6R9Wgk5Atjx54D/does-bayes-beat-goodhart"">quite</a> <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/FuGDYNvA6qh4qyFah/thoughts-on-human-compatible"">difficult</a> to ensure that these actually hold. This also depends on the assumption that there <em>is</em> a true utility function, and that the human <em>knows</em> it, which is not the case, though this is <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.08654"">being addressed</a>.</p><p>One important feature of this agenda is that rather than requiring a perfect utility function to begin with, the AI can learn the utility function by interacting with the human; such a feedback mechanism can make a problem <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/4dHMdK5TLN6xcqtyc/p/4783ufKpx8xvLMPc6"">much easier</a>. Interaction also opens up other possibilities, such as learning human <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/4dHMdK5TLN6xcqtyc/p/eBd6WvzhuqduCkYv3"">norms</a> instead of values. However, it is computationally difficult, and so more <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/dBMC63hjkc5wPqTC7/human-ai-collaboration"">research</a> would be needed to make it a viable solution.</p><h2>Current methods for learning human preferences</h2><p>There has been a lot of practical work on learning human preferences, including:</p><ul><li>Building a mistake model by comparing demonstrations of varying degrees of optimality (either by getting humans to <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.06387"">rank</a> demonstrations or by <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.03976"">introducing noise</a> into optimal demonstrations)</li><li>Learning human-interpretable <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12686"">representations</a> in order to advise humans</li><li>New forms of human <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.09906"">guidance</a>, such as having humans provide the <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.04257"">advantage</a> function (instead of the reward), following <a href=""https://research.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Why-Build-an-Assistant-in-Minecraft-v3.pdf"">natural language</a> <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.02020"">instructions</a>, and learning from the (human-optimized) <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/7f6DNZhracD7RvxMr/learning-preferences-by-looking-at-the-world"">initial state</a></li><li>Learning preferences <a href=""https://openai.com/blog/fine-tuning-gpt-2/"">for natural language</a> (rather than the standard RL setup)</li><li><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.06521"">Combining</a> <a href=""https://rohinshah.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Reward_Combination_NeurIPS_2019_Workshop_Camera_Ready.pdf"">multiple types</a> of human feedback</li><li><a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.13392"">General</a> <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12888"">improvements</a> <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11979"">in</a> <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11108"">imitation</a> <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.06544"">learning</a> and <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00459"">inverse</a> <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.07742"">reinforcement</a> <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.06404"">learning</a>.</li></ul><p>There are many recent papers that I haven&#x2019;t cited here, as it is a very large area of work.</p><h1>Robustness</h1><h2>Safe reinforcement learning</h2><p>We would like to ensure that our AI systems do not make mistakes during training. With preference learning, we can do this by learning human preferences over <a href=""https://deepmind.com/blog/article/learning-human-objectives-by-evaluating-hypothetical-behaviours"">hypothetical behaviors</a> that are not actually executed. Another option is to provide safety constraints and ensure that the AI <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01074"">never violates them</a> (even during training), or at least to <a href=""https://openai.com/blog/safety-gym/"">significantly</a> <a href=""https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jfisac/papers/Bridging_Safety_and_RL.pdf"">reduce</a> such violations.</p><p>Avoiding <em>all</em> mistakes would require us to have a formal specification of what a &#x201C;mistake&#x201D; is, or to have some <a href=""https://intelligence.org/2019/04/24/delegative-reinforcement-learning/"">overseer</a> that can identify &#x201C;mistakes&#x201D; before execution, so that our AI could avoid the mistake even though it hasn&#x2019;t seen this situation before. <em>This seems prohibitively hard to me if we include literally all &#x201C;mistakes&#x201D;.</em></p><h2>Adversarial examples</h2><p>Adversarial examples are a clear demonstration of how the &#x201C;cognition&#x201D; of neural nets is different from our own: by making superficial changes to the input that would not matter to a human, you can completely change the output of the neural net. While I am not an expert here, and certainly have not read the huge mountains of work done over the last year, I do want to highlight a few things.</p><p>First, while we might nominally think of adversarial examples as &#x201C;bugs&#x201D; in our neural net, this <a href=""http://gradientscience.org/adv/"">paper</a> shows that image classifiers are picking up <em>real</em> imperceptible features that <em>do</em> generalize to the test set. The classifiers really are maximizing predictive accuracy; the problem is that we want them to predict labels based on the features that <em>we</em> use, instead of imperceptible (but predictive) features. Adversarial training removes these fragile features, leaving only the robust features; this makes <a href=""http://gradientscience.org/robust_reps/"">subsequent</a> <a href=""http://gradientscience.org/robust_apps/"">applications</a> easier.</p><p>While the paper was controversial, I thought that its main thesis seemed to be supported even after reading <a href=""https://distill.pub/2019/advex-bugs-discussion/"">these six responses</a>.</p><p>Second, there has been a distinct shift away from the L-infinity norm ball threat model of adversarial examples. So far, it seems that robustness to one set of perturbations doesn&#x2019;t grant robustness to other perturbations, prompting the development of <a href=""https://openai.com/blog/testing-robustness/"">multiple perturbations</a>, a benchmark of <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.07174"">natural adversarial examples</a>, and new <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08265"">evaluation metrics</a>. While the L-infinity norm ball is an interesting <a href=""https://medium.com/@catherio/unsolved-research-problems-vs-real-world-threat-models-e270e256bc9e"">unsolved research problem</a>, it is in no way a realistic threat model.</p><p>Third, <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.01647"">adversarial</a> <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10615"">attacks</a> are now being proposed as a method for evaluating how robust an agent trained by reinforcement learning is. This seems especially important since in RL there is often no train-test split, and so it is hard to tell whether an agent has &#x201C;memorized&#x201D; a single trajectory or actually learned a policy that works well across a variety of circumstances.</p><h2>Intent alignment</h2><p>Ultimately, robustness <a href=""https://medium.com/@deepmindsafetyresearch/towards-robust-and-verified-ai-specification-testing-robust-training-and-formal-verification-69bd1bc48bda"">seeks to</a> identify and eliminate all &#x201C;bugs&#x201D;, i.e. behaviors that are inconsistent with the specification (see also this <a href=""https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/pushmeet-kohli-deepmind-safety-research/"">podcast</a>). Instead of considering all the mistakes, we could seek to only prevent <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/EmDuGeRw749sD3GKd/p/qALeGJ9nPcs9eC9Af"">catastrophic mistakes</a>, and ensure that the AI is <em>intent aligned</em>, that is, it is always <em><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/EmDuGeRw749sD3GKd/p/ZeE7EKHTFMBs8eMxn"">trying</a></em> to do what we want. This goal <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/ZeE7EKHTFMBs8eMxn/clarifying-ai-alignment#3ECKoYzFNW2ZqS6km"">avoids</a> many of the pitfalls around the goal of designing an AI with the right utility function.</p><h2>Corrigibility</h2><p>One promising way in which an AI could be intent aligned is by being <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/EmDuGeRw749sD3GKd/p/fkLYhTQteAu5SinAc"">corrigible</a>: roughly, the AI is not trying to deceive us, it clarifies its uncertainty by asking us, it learns about our preferences, it shuts down if we ask it to, etc. This is a <em>narrower</em> concept than intent alignment: an AI that infers our &#x201C;true&#x201D; utility function and optimizes it may wrest control away from us in order to expand faster, or make us safer; such an AI would be <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/o22kP33tumooBtia3/can-corrigibility-be-learned-safely#YgLfCHknM4Ng2hGvB"">aligned but not corrigible</a>. There are a few benefits of using corrigibility:</p><ol><li>It can be achieved with relatively low levels of intelligence (we can imagine corrigible humans)</li><li>It seems to have a positive feedback loop (that is, an AI that reaches some &#x201C;threshold&#x201D; of corrigibility would tend to become more corrigible)</li><li>It doesn&#x2019;t seem to require any domain expertise.</li></ol><p>(A similar <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/F9vcbEMKW48j4Z6h9/non-consequentialist-cooperation"">idea</a> would be to build an AI system that only takes actions that the overseer has given informed consent for.)</p><p>Note that <a href=""http://intelligence.org/files/Corrigibility.pdf"">MIRI&#x2019;s notion of corrigibility</a> (2015) is similar but much stricter. My guess is that MIRI wants the same intuitive corrigibility properties, but wants them to be created by a <em>simple</em> change to the <em>utility function</em>. Simplicity helps ensure that it cannot be gamed, and the utility function means that you are changing what the AI cares about, rather than trying to constrain a powerful superintelligence. For example, I&#x2019;d guess that MIRI-corrigibility can depend on whether a shutdown button is pressed, but cannot depend on the <em>reasons</em> for which the shutdown button is pressed.</p><p>If you set aside the utility function requirement, then this property can be achieved using <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/cGLgs3t9md7v7cCm4/corrigibility-as-constrained-optimisation"">constrained optimization</a>: the agent can optimize normally when the button is not pressed, while ensuring that it is still able to shut down if necessary, and it can optimize for shutting down if the button is pressed. If you set aside the simplicity requirement, then you can define the desired policies and <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/XkuRKqXKAaMySbXCN/indifference-multiple-changes-multiple-agents"">recover</a> the correct utility function. But from now on I&#x2019;m only going to talk about the notion of corrigibility I first introduced.</p><p>It has been <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Djs38EWYZG8o7JMWY/paul-s-research-agenda-faq#79jM2ecef73zupPR4"">argued</a> that while corrigibility is simpler than &#x201C;human values&#x201D;, it is a &#x201C;non-natural&#x201D; type of cognition, such that you are unlikely to be able to find corrigible intelligences with machine learning. <em>(I do not feel the force of this intuition; I agree much more with the earlier intuitions.)</em></p><p>You might be worried that since a corrigible AI defers to us, if we were about to take a suboptimal action that we couldn&#x2019;t tell was suboptimal, the AI wouldn&#x2019;t stop us from doing so because it can&#x2019;t explain to us what would be bad about the world. However, at the very least, <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/rArsypGqq49bk4iRr/can-there-be-an-indescribable-hellworld"">it can say</a> &#x201C;this is bad for reasons I can&#x2019;t fully explain&#x201D;.</p><h2>Worst case guarantees</h2><p>We still want to guarantee that there will <em>never</em> be a failure of corrigibility, which can&#x2019;t be done with regular ML techniques, which only give an <a href=""https://ai-alignment.com/two-guarantees-c4c03a6b434f"">average-case guarantee</a>. In order to get a worst-case guarantee, we need other techniques. <a href=""https://ai-alignment.com/training-robust-corrigibility-ce0e0a3b9b4d"">One</a> <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/9Dy5YRaoCxH9zuJqa/relaxed-adversarial-training-for-inner-alignment"">proposal</a> is to use adversarial training to find abstracted inputs on which the agent is incorrigible, where the adversary is aided by interpretability techniques that allow the adversary to understand what the agent is thinking. It would be particularly nice to find a <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/BKM8uQS6QdJPZLqCr/towards-a-mechanistic-understanding-of-corrigibility"">mechanistic description</a> of corrigibility, as that would make it easier to verify the absence of incorrigible behavior.</p><p>Critics argue that this could never work because machine learning <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Djs38EWYZG8o7JMWY/paul-s-research-agenda-faq#79jM2ecef73zupPR4"">wouldn&#x2019;t learn the &#x201C;intended&#x201D; interpretation</a> of corrigibility, and could be <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/S7csET9CgBtpi7sCh/challenges-to-christiano-s-capability-amplification-proposal"">adversarial</a>. <em>I don&#x2019;t think this objection is critical. It seems like it is saying that ML will fail to generalize and there will be situations in which the concept of corrigibility breaks down, but the entire point of adversarial training is to find these situations and train the agent away from it.</em></p><p><em>While this is usually tied in to the broader iterated amplification agenda, it seems to me that solving just this subproblem would achieve a lot of the value of the full agenda. If we had a way of applying adversarial training to an arbitrary AI agent, such that we are very likely to find potential inputs on which the agent is incorrigible, then presumably AI systems that could be incorrigible would not be deployed. Iterated amplification adds additional safety in that it (hopefully) allows you to assume a smarter, already-aligned adversary, whereas a direct solution to this subproblem would have an approximately-as-capable, not-automatically-aligned adversary, which would probably not have a worst-case guarantee but might still be good enough.</em></p><h1>Scaling to superhuman abilities</h1><h2>Iterated amplification</h2><p>Iterated amplification carves out a <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/HBGd34LKvXM9TxvNf/new-safety-research-agenda-scalable-agent-alignment-via#WJC9Q5MvzqJeNSnLx"">broad class of algorithms</a> that can scale to superhuman abilities, with the hope that we can analyze the alignment properties of the entire class of algorithms at once.

It can be cast as an algorithm in the iterated amplification class by considering an amplification step that takes agents that can evaluate some set of tasks, and builds new human-agent teams that can evaluate some more complex set of tasks. The distillation step would then be reinforcement learning, to get an agent that can directly solve the more complex tasks. Iterating this eventually leads to an agent that can solve the original desired task.</p><p>Iterated amplification does impose a particular structure on algorithms, which can be <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/Y9xD78kufNsF7wL6f/machine-learning-projects-on-ida"">applied</a> to existing ML problems. However, this may be <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/jYdAxH8BarPT4fqnb/a-dilemma-for-prosaic-ai-alignment"">uncompetitive</a> if the best ML algorithms require different algorithmic structures or different environments, in order to reach high capabilities (though we could then train a question-answering system <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/jYdAxH8BarPT4fqnb/a-dilemma-for-prosaic-ai-alignment#K8fRPa9NWZXdARLYN"">alongside</a> the other algorithm / environment, which plausibly doesn&#x2019;t take too many more resources).</p><p>The <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/EmDuGeRw749sD3GKd"">iterated amplification</a> sequence, <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07871"">recursive reward modeling</a> paper, and <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Djs38EWYZG8o7JMWY/paul-s-research-agenda-faq"">these</a> <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/FdfzFcRvqLf4k5eoQ/list-of-resolved-confusions-about-ida"">posts</a> help explain the full agenda better.</p><h2>Quantilization</h2><p><a href=""https://intelligence.org/files/QuantilizersSaferAlternative.pdf"">Quantilization</a> (2015) allows you to amplify a base policy by randomly selecting among the top 1/Q of actions the base policy could take, at a cost of at most Q-fold increase in risk. However, this can <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/Rs6vZCrnQFWQ4p37P/when-to-use-quantilization"">forgo benefits</a> of the rest of the base policy. Since quantilization increases risk, it cannot be safely iterated: for example, if you start with a policy with a worst-case 1% chance of failure, and you 5-quantilize it, you now have a worst-case 5% chance of failure. After two more iterations of 5-quantilization, there is no longer a worst-case bound on failure probability.</p><h2>Debate</h2><p>Another mechanism for scaling beyond humans is <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00899"">debate</a> (<a href=""https://futureoflife.org/2019/03/06/ai-alignment-through-debate-with-geoffrey-irving/"">podcast</a>), in which an AI agent is trained via self-play in a zero-sum game in which its goal is to &#x201C;win&#x201D; the debate, as evaluated by a human judge. The key hope is that detecting a lie is easier than lying: if one of the players lies or deceives or manipulates the human, then the other player can reveal that and thereby win the debate. If this were true, we would expect that the equilibrium behavior is for the agent to provide honest, useful information.</p><p>Since its proposal, debate has been <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/5Kv2qNfRyXXihNrx2/ai-safety-debate-and-its-applications"">tested</a> with MNIST and Fashion MNIST, as well as <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05863"">question answering</a>. There is also a <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/jYvm4mmjvGHcPXtGL/a-concrete-proposal-for-adversarial-ida"">proposal</a> to use it to improve iterated amplification.</p><p><a href=""https://medium.com/@RyanCarey/new-paper-when-is-truth-telling-favored-in-ai-debate-8f58f14562e5"">Theoretical work</a> brings up the possibility of questions that are &#x201C;too hard&#x201D;: while sufficiently long &#x201C;feature debates&#x201D; are provably truth-seeking (because the debaters can reveal all of their information), it is possible to construct complex questions in which the debate doesn&#x2019;t find the right answer. However, the results <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/RQoSCs9SePDMLJvfz/new-paper-when-is-truth-telling-favored-in-ai-debate#gCeKuJ62HmLtPB9C9"">don&#x2019;t generalize well</a> from feature debates to real debates.</p><p>Relatedly, even if it is easy to detect lies, it&#x2019;s not clear what would happen with <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/fNTCveSa4HvqvZR2F/problems-with-ai-debate"">ambiguous questions</a>.</p><p>Since debate doesn&#x2019;t involve alternating between increasing capabilities and increasing efficiency, it isn&#x2019;t an <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/HBGd34LKvXM9TxvNf/new-safety-research-agenda-scalable-agent-alignment-via#WJC9Q5MvzqJeNSnLx"">instance</a> of iterated amplification. However, both iterated amplification and debate are aiming to compute the answer that an exponentially large tree of bounded humans would arrive at (see next section), and so it seems likely that either they would both work, or neither would work.</p><h2>Factored cognition</h2><p>Both iterated amplification and debate depend on the <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/EmDuGeRw749sD3GKd/p/DFkGStzvj3jgXibFG"">factored</a> <a href=""https://ought.org/presentations/delegating-cognitive-work-2019-06"">cognition</a> hypothesis: that arbitrarily complex tasks can be performed arbitrarily well by a <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/EmDuGeRw749sD3GKd/p/NXqs4nYXaq8q6dTTx"">giant tree</a> of bounded base agents, possibly extended with features like shared external memory or <a href=""https://ai-alignment.com/strong-hch-bedb0dc08d4e"">long-lived assistants</a> (2016).</p><p>Iterated amplification checks local nodes in a tree of considerations and broken-down questions, in which an assistant at level k decomposes its questions, gets answers from assistants at level k-1, and combines them into an overall answer. Meanwhile, in debate, if the two agents disagree, they will play down the most difficult / contested path in an exponential tree of arguments and counterarguments, so the debate training procedure is checking a single path from root to leaf in the exponential tree.</p><p>It is an open question whether the factored cognition hypothesis is true. <a href=""https://ought.org/updates/2019-10-28-progress-update"">Empirical work</a> has been scaling up, and we should hopefully have some informative evidence in the upcoming year.</p><p>The main reasons people are skeptical of the hypothesis are because it seems that sufficiently complex tasks require building up <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/J7Rnt8aJPH7MALkmq/vaniver-s-view-on-factored-cognition"">big contexts</a> or using globally-constructed intuitions or <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/4qY9zEHLa2su4PkQ4/can-hch-epistemically-dominate-ramanujan"">&#x201C;inexplicable flashes of insight&#x201D;</a>. This could be done if the &#x201C;small&#x201D; agents simulated an arbitrary Turing Machine, but this would <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/S7csET9CgBtpi7sCh/challenges-to-christiano-s-capability-amplification-proposal"">lose</a> any guarantees of alignment.</p><p>However, we might expect that these tasks could still be done by a tree of humans: humans are <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/LigbvLH9yKR5Zhd6y/what-s-wrong-with-these-analogies-for-understanding-informed"">allowed</a> to use a heuristic &#x201C;just because it works&#x201D;; this should allow the tree of humans to use heuristics that other agents use, including &#x201C;inexplicable flashes of insight&#x201D;.</p><h1>Universality</h1><h2>Alignment of the tree of humans</h2><p>In order for this tree of humans to be aligned (a necessary condition for iterated amplification or debate to be aligned), the initial agent must already be aligned, and putting the agents together must not destroy alignment. One <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/S7csET9CgBtpi7sCh/challenges-to-christiano-s-capability-amplification-proposal"">intuition</a> that this is hard is that alignment is not compositional; a &#x201C;big&#x201D; agent made up of &#x201C;small&#x201D; aligned agents need not be aligned. However, the hope doesn&#x2019;t depend on compositionality of alignment; it instead depends on ensuring that your agents never do incorrigible optimization.</p><p>In addition, it could be the case that &#x201C;large&#x201D; initial agents like humans (or human imitations) are not robustly aligned, because there may be some <a href=""https://ai-alignment.com/universality-and-security-amplification-551b314a3bab"">clever argument</a> that causes them to behave incorrigibly. One response would be to use <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/yxzrKb2vFXRkwndQ4/understanding-iterated-distillation-and-amplification-claims"">low-bandwidth overseers</a> as the initial agent, who only answer very &#x201C;small&#x201D; questions on which we are relatively confident that there are no such failures. We would also hope to <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/4JuKoFguzuMrNn6Qr/hch-is-not-just-mechanical-turk"">train</a> humans to properly decompose questions and behave corrigibly, so that putting together several humans remains corrigible (a task for which we need <a href=""https://blog.openai.com/ai-safety-needs-social-scientists/"">social scientists</a>).</p><p>Note that it is only competitive to approximate the tree of humans with iterated amplification if we expect that any powerful AI systems will also be trained in a manner similar to iterated amplification. If we instead consider a <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/H5gXpFtg93qDMZ6Xn/aligning-a-toy-model-of-optimization"">model</a> in which ML perfectly optimizes a function (rather than performing iterated local search), then iterated amplification would be far more expensive than unaligned powerful AI systems. It would be worth studying this simpler model to see if alignment is possible there.</p><h2>Ascription universality</h2><p>Even if we know that the tree of humans is aligned, we also need to ensure that the model trained from oversight from the tree of humans will also be aligned. The key claim in favor of this is that HCH (the tree of humans) is <em>universal</em>, that is, it &#x201C;knows&#x201D; any facts that a sufficiently smaller computation &#x201C;knows&#x201D;. This was formalized <a href=""https://ai-alignment.com/towards-formalizing-universality-409ab893a456"">here</a> and applied to <a href=""https://ai-alignment.com/informed-oversight-18fcb5d3d1e1"">multiple</a> <a href=""https://ai-alignment.com/universality-and-model-based-rl-b08701394ddd"">problems</a>, including the problem that malign optimization might <a href=""https://ai-alignment.com/universality-and-consequentialism-within-hch-c0bee00365bd"">emerge</a> <em>within</em> HCH. While a good explanation of this is out of scope here, I summarized these posts <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/3kzFPA5uuaGZWg4PS/an-81-universality-as-a-potential-solution-to-conceptual"">here</a>. Ascription universality does have to be <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/R5Euq7gZgobJi5S25/nuances-with-ascription-universality"">applied</a> to the entire training process and not just the final model.</p><h1>Interpretability</h1><p>Since we want to be able to &#x201C;know everything the model knows&#x201D;, and also to be able to find situations under with a model behaves corrigibly (see worst case guarantees above), it would be very useful to be able to peer inside our models and understand what they are doing. It would be particularly useful to be able to identify optimization processes and <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/Zj2PgP5A8vY2G3gYw/optimization-provenance"">understand</a> how they come about.</p><p>Even though interpretability tools probably could not <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/J9D6Bi3eFDDhCaovi/will-transparency-help-catch-deception-perhaps-not"">deal with</a> already deceptive models, since the deceptive models could figure out how to fool the tools, it seems likely that interpretability could help <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/J9D6Bi3eFDDhCaovi/will-transparency-help-catch-deception-perhaps-not#yn5YcLnL6vs6AxxAE"">prevent</a> deception from ever arising -- hopefully an easier task.</p><p>However, interpretability has other uses besides catching problems: it could also be <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/X2i9dQQK3gETCyqh2/chris-olah-s-views-on-agi-safety"">used</a> to get more understandable models during training, provide feedback on the <em>process</em> by which a model makes a decision (rather than feedback on just the decision), or create ML techniques that help us understand the world without acting in it (thus avoiding problems with agential AI).</p><p>Unfortunately, I haven&#x2019;t kept up with interpretability research, so I can&#x2019;t say how it&#x2019;s progressed recently, but one paper you could start with is <a href=""https://distill.pub/2019/activation-atlas/"">activation atlases</a>.</p><h1>Impact regularization</h1><h2>Impact measures</h2><p>In 2018, there was a lot of progress on proposing specific impact measures, including <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01186"">relative reachability</a> and <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/yEa7kwoMpsBgaBCgb/towards-a-new-impact-measure"">attainable utility preservation</a> (<a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/mDTded2Dn7BKRBEPX/penalizing-impact-via-attainable-utility-preservation"">followup</a>, <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09725"">paper</a>). These were recently <a href=""https://medium.com/@deepmindsafetyresearch/designing-agent-incentives-to-avoid-side-effects-e1ac80ea6107"">unified</a> as using similar underlying algorithms but with different &#x201C;deviation measures&#x201D;: the former considers the change in number of reachable states, whereas the latter considers the change in attainable utility (for some set of utility functions).</p><p>These <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/TPy4RJvzogqqupDKk/a-survey-of-early-impact-measures"">two</a> <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/pf48kg9xCxJAcHmQc/understanding-recent-impact-measures"">posts</a> summarize the work on impact (going back till 2012).</p><h2>What is impact, anyway?</h2><p>The <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/7CdoznhJaLEKHwvJW"">Reframing Impact</a> sequence aims to build intuitions about what we mean by &#x201C;impact&#x201D;, and concludes that an action is impactful if it changes our ability to get what we want. Of course, this definition depends on &#x201C;what we want&#x201D;, whereas usually with impact regularization we want something that is <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/7CdoznhJaLEKHwvJW/p/xCxeBSHqMEaP3jDvY"">easy to specify</a>. However, we might hope that impact is relatively goal-agnostic, because for most goals you need to pursue the same convergent instrumental subgoals. In particular, we might hope for a formalizable notion of <em>power</em>, that attainable utility preservation could penalize.</p><p>To better distinguish between different definitions and techniques for measuring impact, this <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/wzPzPmAsG3BwrBrwy/test-cases-for-impact-regularisation-methods"">post</a> proposes several test cases for impact regularization.</p><h2>Utility of impact measures</h2><p>The mainline use case for impact regularization is to be an &#x201C;additional layer of defense&#x201D;: if for some reason we fail to align an AI system, then hopefully there still won&#x2019;t be catastrophic consequences, because the AI system only takes low-impact actions. However, this may fail to work for a <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/kCY9dYGLoThC3aG7w/best-reasons-for-pessimism-about-impact-of-impact-measures"">variety</a> of <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/zrunBA8B5bmm2XZ59/reversible-changes-consider-a-bucket-of-water"">reasons</a>. Still, work on impact measures could be <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/wJK944YqvFwjdbqCP/four-ways-an-impact-measure-could-help-alignment"">useful</a> for deconfusion, testing protocols, temporary alignment measures, or <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/jGB7Pd5q8ivBor8Ee/impact-measurement-and-value-neutrality-verification-1"">value-neutrality verification</a>.</p><h1>Causal modeling</h1><p><a href=""https://medium.com/@deepmindsafetyresearch/understanding-agent-incentives-with-causal-influence-diagrams-7262c2512486"">Causal influence diagrams</a> help us understand what a training <em>process</em> does. Given a causal influence diagram, we can determine <em>observation incentives</em> (what an agent would like to know) and <em>intervention incentives</em> (what an agent would like to change). We can produce such diagrams for <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08663"">AGI safety frameworks</a>, and <a href=""https://medium.com/@deepmindsafetyresearch/designing-agent-incentives-to-avoid-reward-tampering-4380c1bb6cd"">analyze</a> solutions to reward function tampering, user feedback tampering, and observation tampering. For example, it allows us to show that if the agent&#x2019;s plans are evaluated by the current reward, then there is no incentive for the agent to tamper with its reward function.</p><p>The variables of the diagrams represent important components of the agent and the environment (such as reward functions and dynamics models in the agent, and the user&#x2019;s preferences and the state of the world in the environment). Different ways of combining these into agent setups lead to different causal influence diagrams. The incentive analysis enables the designer to choose agent setups with good incentive properties.</p><p>However, the causal models themselves are not uniquely determined. For example, what counts as wireheading is <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/BvctuKocyWR4YYea3/wireheading-is-in-the-eye-of-the-beholder"">relative</a> to the stance taken towards the system and its desired goals. For example, if you <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/vXzM5L6njDZSf4Ftk/defining-ai-wireheading"">define</a> it as taking control of some &#x201C;narrow measurement channel&#x201D;, then what is a measurement channel and what the goal is depends on modeling assumptions.</p><h1>Oracles</h1><p>Oracles also benefit from reasoning about causality and influences.

BoMAI is an AIXI-like system that does not seek power, because it only cares about reward until the end of the episode (myopia), and during the episode it is confined to a box from which information cannot leave. Such an AI system can still be useful because there is also a human in the box, who can transmit information to the outside world after the episode has ended.</p><h1>Strategy and coordination</h1><p>So far I&#x2019;ve been talking about the technical work on the alignment problem. Let&#x2019;s now switch to more &#x201C;meta&#x201D; work that tries to predict the future in order to prioritize across research topics.</p><h2>Continuous vs discontinuous takeoff</h2><p>A central disagreement among AI researchers is about how &#x201C;quickly&#x201D; AI improves once it reaches human level. Recently, the question has been distilled to whether there will be a <em>discontinuity</em> in AI capabilities. As a result, I will ask whether takeoff will be <em>continuous</em> or <em>discontinuous</em> (as opposed to <em>slow</em> or <em>fast</em>).</p><p>One operationalization of this question is whether there will be a 4-year doubling of GDP that ends before the first 1-year doubling of GDP starts. Note that continuous takeoff need not be slow: to get to 4-year doubling, you need superexponential growth. Under exponential growth, the doubling time stays fixed at its current value of a few decades. Extrapolating <a href=""https://aiimpacts.org/historical-growth-trends/"">historical growth trends</a> (which &#x201C;supports the possibility of radical increases in growth rate&#x201D;) would still (probably) be compatible with this operationalization.</p><p><a href=""https://sideways-view.com/2018/02/24/takeoff-speeds/"">Two</a> <a href=""https://aiimpacts.org/likelihood-of-discontinuous-progress-around-the-development-of-agi/"">posts</a> argue for continuous takeoff; the main argument is that continuity is very likely for properties that people care about, since lots of people are trying to make progress on the property, and it is less likely that we quickly invest much more effort into making progress on the property. So far, there <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/PzAnWgqvfESgQEvdg/any-rebuttals-of-christiano-and-ai-impacts-on-takeoff-speeds"">has not been</a> a compelling response, but this <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/PzAnWgqvfESgQEvdg/any-rebuttals-of-christiano-and-ai-impacts-on-takeoff-speeds#rXh6LNmoz64mLv2kX"">does not mean</a> that researchers agree.</p><p>There has been some discussion of particular properties that make discontinuous takeoff seem more likely (though I would guess that they are not the arguments that MIRI researchers would make). For example, perhaps we just need to find the one correct architecture, which will then cause a discontinuity, but note that birds and primates have <a href=""https://aiimpacts.org/primates-vs-birds-is-one-brain-architecture-better-than-the-other/"">independently evolved</a> neural architectures that both work well.</p><p>Alternatively, AI systems with different explicit utility functions could <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/gYaKZeBbSL4y2RLP3/strategic-implications-of-ais-ability-to-coordinate-at-low"">cooperate by merging</a> to pursue a joint utility function, making them much more effective at coordination than humans, allowing them to <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/Sn5NiiD5WBi4dLzaB/agi-will-drastically-increase-economies-of-scale"">avoid</a> principal-agent problems that plague human corporations. This could lead to a discontinuous jump. AI systems could also <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/dt4z82hpvvPFTDTfZ/six-ai-risk-strategy-ideas"">build monopolies</a> through such coordination to obtain a decisive strategic advantage.</p><p>We could also <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/Sn5NiiD5WBi4dLzaB/agi-will-drastically-increase-economies-of-scale"">expect</a> that just as the invention of culture and social learning by evolution allowed humans to become the dominant species very quickly (relatively speaking), similarly once AI systems are capable of social learning they may also &#x201C;take off&#x201D; discontinuously. However, the same argument could be taken as evidence <em><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/XjuT9vgBfwXPxsdfN/might-humans-not-be-the-most-intelligent-animals"">against</a></em> a discontinuity, since current natural language systems like <a href=""https://blog.openai.com/better-language-models/"">GPT-2</a> could already be thought of as processing culture or doing social learning.</p><p>It is worth noting that questions about <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/CjW4axQDqLd2oDCGG/misconceptions-about-continuous-takeoff"">recursive self improvement</a> and <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/PKy8NuNPknenkDY74/soft-takeoff-can-still-lead-to-decisive-strategic-advantage"">decisive strategic advantage</a> do not map cleanly onto the question of takeoff speeds, though they are related. The primary reason takeoff speed is important is that it determines whether or not we will be able to respond to problems as they come up. For this purpose, it&#x2019;s probably better to define takeoff speed with respect to the <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/cxgtQXnH2uDGBJJGa/redefining-fast-takeoff"">amount of work</a> that can be done as AI takes off, which might differ significantly from calendar time.</p><h2>The importance of compute</h2><p>There is a strong case that the most effective methods (so far) are the ones that can <a href=""http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html"">leverage</a> more computation, and the <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10985"">AI-GA approach</a> to general intelligence is predicated on this view (for example, by <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.01753"">learning good learning environments</a>). In fact, since the rise of deep learning in 2012, the <a href=""https://openai.com/blog/ai-and-compute/"">amount</a> of compute used in the largest AI training runs has been increasing exponentially with a 3.4-<em>month</em> doubling time. It&#x2019;s important to note the caveat that we cannot simply increase compute: we also <a href=""https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/m.welling/wp-content/uploads/Model-versus-Data-AI-1.pdf"">need good data</a>, which is sparse in rare, unsafe situations (consider driving when a pedestrian suddenly jumps on the road). This may require human knowledge and explicit models.</p><p>Since it seems more likely that compute grows continuously (relative to a &#x201C;deep insights&#x201D; model), this would argue for a more continuous takeoff. However, you may expect that we still need deep insights, potentially because you think that current techniques could never lead to AGI, due to their lack of some property <a href=""https://aiimpacts.org/evidence-against-current-methods-leading-to-human-level-artificial-intelligence/"">crucial</a> to general intelligence (such as <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/SvhzEQkwFGNTy6CsN/alphastar-impressive-for-rl-progress-not-for-agi-progress"">causal reasoning</a>). However, for any such property, it seems that <em>some</em> neural net could encode that property, and the <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/SvhzEQkwFGNTy6CsN/alphastar-impressive-for-rl-progress-not-for-agi-progress#kRpwqPPjcGEbEhXHA"">relevant question</a> is how big the neural net has to be and how long it takes for local search to find the right computation.</p><h2>Sociological evidence</h2><p>It has recently become more common to critique the field of AI as a whole, which should (arguably) cause you to lengthen your timelines. For example, <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.07633"">hypothesizing after the results are known</a> makes for bad science that doesn&#x2019;t generalize, and research that is &#x201C;reproducible&#x201D; in the sense that the code can be rerun to get the same results need not have <a href=""http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/bouthillier19a/bouthillier19a.pdf"">external validity</a>. There is also a tendency for researchers to throw trial and error at problems, which means that with repeated trials by chance we can get results that look significant. It also means that researchers don&#x2019;t understand the systems they build; <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/X2i9dQQK3gETCyqh2/chris-olah-s-views-on-agi-safety"">reorienting</a> the field to focus on understanding could make our design decisions more deliberate and make it more likely that we build aligned AIs.</p><p>We should also expect that at least industry research is <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/KnQs55tjxWopCzKsk/the-ai-timelines-scam"">biased</a> towards short timelines, since any companies that didn&#x2019;t argue for short timelines would be much less likely to get funding.</p><h2>Meta work on forecasting</h2><p>While forecasting the future is notoriously hard, collaborative and checkable forecasting is even harder. It would be nice to at least reduce the difficulty back down to &#x201C;regular&#x201D; forecasting. Three steps have been taken towards this:</p><ol><li>People need to agree on the meaning of the terms used; an AI forecasting <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/8y7DcSF4eAkXoru4u/ai-forecasting-dictionary-forecasting-infrastructure-part-1-2"">dictionary</a> has been developed for this purpose.</li><li>In order to be checkable, questions need to be operationalized; but then it is often the case that the primary determinant of the answer to a question depends on some &#x201C;distractor&#x201D; feature. For example, whether we have a superhuman AI at &lt;game&gt; by 2025 depends a lot on who tries to make such an AI, rather than whether we have the technical ability to make such an AI. A partial solution was to create a <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9G6CCNXkA7JZoorpY/ai-forecasting-resolution-council-forecasting-infrastructure"">resolution council</a>, and instead have questions ask about the future opinion of the resolution council.</li><li>This <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yy3FCmdAbgSLePD7H/how-to-write-good-ai-forecasting-questions-question-database"">post</a> provides advice on how to write good forecasting questions, with a database of examples.</li></ol><p>Of course, there is still the hard problem of actually figuring out what happens in the future (and it&#x2019;s even <a href=""https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/how-feasible-long-range-forecasting"">hard</a> to tell <em>whether</em> long-run forecasting is feasible). The Good Judgment Project studied practices that help with this problem, summarized <a href=""https://aiimpacts.org/evidence-on-good-forecasting-practices-from-the-good-judgment-project/"">here</a>.</p><p>Another <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Lds9opZsAMbjuZp7h/coordination-surveys-why-we-should-survey-to-organize"">issue</a> arises when asking members of a group (e.g. AI researchers) about outcomes that depend on actions within that group: due to the bystander effect, everyone may predict that the group will solve a problem, even though they themselves are not trying to solve the problem. So, we should instead ask people to make predictions about the proportion of members that try to solve a problem, and compare that to the proportion of members who say that they are trying to solve the problem.</p><h1>AI Progress</h1><p>A full update on AI progress in 2019 would be far too long, so here I&#x2019;ll just mention some results I found interesting, which biases towards 1. results involving &#x201C;throwing compute at the problem&#x201D;, and 2. understanding deep learning.</p><h2>Reinforcement learning</h2><ol><li><a href=""https://deepmind.com/blog/alphastar-mastering-real-time-strategy-game-starcraft-ii/"">AlphaStar</a> (<a href=""https://deepmind.com/blog/article/AlphaStar-Grandmaster-level-in-StarCraft-II-using-multi-agent-reinforcement-learning"">update</a>, <a href=""https://www.alexirpan.com/2019/02/22/alphastar-part2.html"">discussion</a>) become extremely good at Starcraft.</li><li><a href=""https://openai.com/blog/how-to-train-your-openai-five/"">OpenAI Five</a> beat the world champions at Dota, and could play cooperatively alongside humans.</li><li>OpenAI trained a robot to manipulate a <a href=""https://openai.com/blog/solving-rubiks-cube/"">Rubik&#x2019;s cube</a> so that it could sometimes solve a jumbled cube when given the steps of the solution.

puv9RQaTZZNa5dzbu,"Review: How to Read a Book (Mortimer Adler, Charles Van Doren)",review-how-to-read-a-book-mortimer-adler-charles-van-doren,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/puv9RQaTZZNa5dzbu/review-how-to-read-a-book-mortimer-adler-charles-van-doren,2020-01-27T21:10:01.266Z,50,15,8,False,False,,"<p>As part of my research on how to <a href=""https://acesounderglass.com/2020/01/06/call-for-volunteers/"">bootstrap understanding in a field</a>, I’m reading books that attempt to answer that question. You might think I should have started with that, but it was useful to get a sense of what problems I needed to solve before I looked for the solution. <em>How to Read a Book</em> (<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0671212095/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=acesoundergla-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0671212095&amp;linkId=39a61f6e4c8ee2ffd1bbf21f48b941ac"">affiliate link</a>) is generally very well regarded in this area and came with a strong recommendation from the CEO of <a href=""http://roamresearch.com"">Roam</a>, who I would expect to have pretty good thoughts on learning structure. Nonetheless, I was quite disappointed. It took me a long time to put my disappointment into words, but with the help of someone on Facebook I finally figured it out: <strong><em>How to Read a Book</em> is aimed at a narrower subset of books than it acknowledges.</strong> What subset, you might ask? I don’t have a great answer, because the authors clearly consider the subset to be the only books, or the only books worth reading, so they didn’t leave a lot of clues. </p>
<p>What I can say is that it expects books to follow a rigid structure, and to have a single unifying point (what they call “the unity”). This seems to me to be setting up both the author and the reader to throw out a lot of information because they weren’t expecting to see it or couldn’t fit it into their existing frameworks- <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seeing_Like_a_State"">reading like a state</a>, in essence. This is not the only thing that makes me think HtRaB is more about being able to understand <em>a book</em> than understand <em>the world</em>, although it’s the only one I can articulate.</p>
<p><em>How to Read a Book</em> didn’t even attempt to answer my current most important question in reading: How do I know what to save or pay attention to? More attentive reading (including but not limited to note-taking) takes more time and more mental effort. Even if it was free, every additional memory or note eats up space in my brain or exobrain and makes it harder to find other thoughts when I look for them. But I don’t necessarily know how important a piece of information is when I read it. Good pre-reading might help me know how important it is to that particular work, but never to my life as a whole.</p>
<p>HtRaB acknowledges that different works have vastly different returns to attention and you should allocate your reading effort accordingly, but I don’t feel like it gave me guidance for choosing what to pay attention to, and I have a suspicion that if I pressed the point the authors’ answer would be extremely in line with the literary and scientific canon of the 1940s-1970s.</p>
<p>My favorite section of <em>How to Read a Book</em> is also the most mechanically detailed: the algorithm for pre-processing a book (explained in detail <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/cxpDhWtxY6d6idi4y/how-to-read-a-book#5jgz8g2kgzhY2JFf2"">here</a>). I don’t know if this was the most useful to me because it was the most detailed or because a teacher once told me skimming was immoral and I needed that to be challenged.</p>
<p>For the meat of reading, <em>How to Read a Book</em> suggests questions to ask but not how to determine the answer. To be fair, this is hard. As I work on my own guide to reading I’m intensely aware of how difficult it is to translate the intentions and external appearance of what I’m doing to inner workings comprehensible to many, or even to other people very similar to myself.  I suspect there are people for whom reading these questions causes something to click in their brain and they suddenly start reading better, and that’s great, but it makes the book lucky, not good. Which is nothing to be ashamed of: sometimes a stab at a hard problem is worth more than a perfect solution to an easy one.  But HtRaB’s stab did not happen to hit my particular problem, nor contain enough deep models to let me make the stab myself.</p>
<p>My overall impression is that this is one of those books that is helpful if you read it at the right time and pretty meh otherwise, and it was the wrong time for me. I also predicted it would be one of those books that’s notable for founding a genre but goes on to be surpassed by later books that learned from it, but when I looked at Amazon I found very little. There’s lots on speedreading, confusing memorization with learning, and  “how to study to pass a test designed by someone else”, and I may end up reading some of those because the field is that sparse, but they’re not what I actually want.

<li>How do you find the most likely sources of relevant or useful information?</li>

s6yy2oGbENSPLwGRS,Healing vs. exercise analogies for emotional work,healing-vs-exercise-analogies-for-emotional-work,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/s6yy2oGbENSPLwGRS/healing-vs-exercise-analogies-for-emotional-work,2020-01-27T19:10:01.477Z,48,26,8,False,False,,"<p>I know a fair number of people who put in a lot of effort into things like emotional healing, digging up and dealing with buried trauma, meditative and therapy practices, and so on. (I count myself in this category.)</p>
<p>And I think that there’s a thing that sometimes happens when other people see all of this, which is that it all seems kinda fake. I say this because even I have this thought sometimes. The core of the thought is something like, “if all of this stuff really worked, shouldn’t you be <i>finished</i> sometime? You claim that practice X was really beneficial, so why have you now been talking about the way that practice Y is great – is any of them really that good if you keep jumping between them?”</p>
<p>And there is something to this suspicion. I do think that jumping from thing to thing, each time claiming that you have found something amazing and transformative while you are actually only deluding yourself, <i>is</i> definitely a thing that sometimes happens. I can say this because I’ve been that person, too.</p>
<p>But it’s not the only possibility. Sometimes the moving from thing to thing <i>does</i> mean that you are getting genuine value out of each, and you work on each until you hit diminishing returns, and then you move on to the next practice to help deal with the issues that the previous one didn’t address.</p>
<p>And it’s worth noting that to the skeptical mind, the <i>opposite</i> pattern can be suspicious too. Sometimes someone does stick with just one practice – a particular style of meditation, say – for years, maybe decades. And keeps talking about how great and healing it is. And again the person who keeps hearing this starts wondering, okay, if it’s so healing, why are you not totally healed yet?</p>
<p>And again, there is something to that suspicion. Sometimes people <i>do</i> stick to one thing and think that it is amazing, even if it is not really delivering them any results, and they would be better off switching to something else.</p>
<p>But then sometimes it really _is_ the case that their practice just <i>is</i> that good, and they keep getting consistent results.</p>
<p>I think that the major issue here is that “healing” isn’t quite the right metaphor. Yes, much of what these practices do could be considered healing, in that they can help you resolve old stuff, possibly for good.</p>
<p>But the way we usually conceive of healing is that you have some specific sickness or injury, then it’s healed, and then you are healthy and don’t need to do any more healing until you get sick again. And that’s not quite the right model for these kinds of practices.</p>
<p>I think that a better model would be physical exercise. Just like the emotional practices, exercise can be useful for healing – I am counting physiotherapy as a form of physical exercise here, though obviously exercise can help heal even if it is not explicitly physiotherapy. But even though healing is one of the things that exercise does, that’s not its <i>only</i> purpose.</p>
<p>If someone said that they had maintained a jogging habit every day for the last twenty years and that it made them feel consistently amazing, nobody would find that particularly suspicious.</p>
<p>And if someone said that they had done yoga for flexibility a while, then taken up running for the cardio, injured themselves and done physiotherapy for a while, and then started doing weightlifting for the sake of muscle, and each of those had been exactly the right thing to do, then that wouldn’t be very suspicious either.</p>
<p>A simple “healthy/unhealthy” model isn’t any better for mental and emotional well-being than it is for physical shape. There are things that count as genuine injuries and diseases, yes, but there are also things which require active maintenance, as well as different subareas that you may want to focus on. You might stick with the same practices for a long time, your whole life even, if they seem particularly effective. And you may also want to switch practices from time to time, because you no longer need an old one, or in response to new needs from changed circumstances, or just for the sake of variety.</p>",Kaj_Sotala,kaj_sotala,Kaj_Sotala,

In music, as with everything, there's a tradeoff between reliability
and hassle.  If I come to a gig with my mandolin and the neck falls
off, I'm going to be having a bad night.  But mandolin necks only
rarely fall off, and bringing an extra mandolin would be expensive and
annoying, so I don't.  On the other hand strings do break, 

<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/whoops"">sometimes comically</a>, so most musicians bring
backups.



</p><p>

My <a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/rhythm-stage-setup-v2"">rhythm stage setup</a> is in an
awkward position here, because general-purpose computers aren't all
that reliable.  Not only do computers sometimes break, but my setup
isn't something I can properly back up, and could be hard to replicate
on another computer.

</p>

<p>

This is a silly situation: one of the amazing things about computers
is that copying things is free.  I should be able to upload my setup,
and then download it onto any other computer in minutes, and be going
right away.  Why can't I do that with my stage setup? I found out
yesterday when my computer died and I was trying to set up a new one
[1] before the next <a href=""https://www.kingfisherband.com/"">Kingfisher</a> gig (<a href=""http://www.monadnockfolk.org/?tribe_events=%e2%98%bc-%e2%98%bc-%e2%98%bc-peterborough-first-saturday-contra-dance-10"">Saturday</a>).
Issues I ran into:



</p>

<p>

</p>

<ul>

<li><p>I use several commercial sounds: Native
Instruments <a href=""https://www.native-instruments.com/en/products/komplete/keys/vintage-organs/"">Hammond
Organ</a> and <a href=""https://www.native-instruments.com/en/products/komplete/keys/scarbee-mark-1/"">Fender
Rhodes</a>, SWAM's <a href=""https://audiomodeling.com/solo-woodwinds/swam-saxophones/"">Saxophones</a>,
and Sample Modeling's <a href=""https://www.samplemodeling.com/en/products_trombone.php"">Trombone</a>.
These needed to be installed and activated.</p></li>

<li><p>These sounds were running in Kontakt 5, and the new thing is
Kontakt 6. While I could restore my Reaper session from backup it
wasn't able to transfer my settings between Kontakt versions.  I
needed to manually set a zillion individual sliders (ex: ""Hammond &gt;
Amp &gt; Rotor &gt; Balance &gt; One notch CCW from top"").  Luckily my
old computer was working well enough to let me read the settings, with
patience, so I've now <a href=""https://github.com/jeffkaufman/jammer/blob/master/README.md"">documented
them</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>I haven't succeeded in building my <a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/bass-whistle"">Bass
Whistle Plugin</a> in a way that will run on computers it wasn't built
for, so I needed to rebuild from source.  This required downloading
the <a href=""https://www.steinberg.net/en/company/developers.html"">plugin
SDK</a>, which then didn't work against my forked copy of the <a href=""https://github.com/iPlug2/iPlug2"">plugin framework</a>.  It
turned out to be easiest to start with a fresh copy of the framework
and <a href=""https://github.com/jeffkaufman/iPlug2/commit/952e14954f44593f85d2ea1c6531b29127b05b88"">copy
over my implementation</a> on top of it.</p></li>

<li><p>The Reaper export doesn't seem to keep track of MIDI mappings,
so I needed to tell Reaper about all of my MIDI devices and which
device controlled which track.  There's no information here, it's just
""<code>jammer-hammond</code> should drive the <code>hammond</code>
track"" but it's still fiddly by-hand configuration.</p></li>

<li><p>Some of my sounds that use Apple's <a href=""https://reaperblog.net/2015/12/how-to-use-general-midi-in-reaper/"">DLS
Music Device</a> with ReaControlMIDI are getting <a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/crash-synth-2020-01-25.txt"">EXC_I386_DIV (divide by zero)</a>
errors and crashing Reaper.  I use sounds like these for cases where I
want a simple overlay on top of the piano, because they're very fast
and responsive, and not taxing on the computer.  They're not great
sounds, but they're much better than <a href=""https://www.plogue.com/products/sforzando.html"">Sforzando</a>
with the free Fluid_R3 sound font.  I'd like to post my crash report
to the Reaper forum, but I'm waiting for my account to be verified.
If I don't have this sorted out by my gig next weekend I'm going to
need to find adequate replacements for a bunch of sounds.</p></li>

</ul>



<p>

There were, of course, other parts that went well.  My main <a href=""https://github.com/jeffkaufman/jammer"">routing code</a> is open
source and worked out of the box.  My <a href=""https://github.com/jeffkaufman/pitch-detect"">stand-alone
pitch-to-midi code</a> also had no issues.  My Reaper backup worked
ok aside from losing plugin settings.  Part of me wants to move
entirely to an open-source synthesize-everything-myself way of doing
things so I can just download and run my software, but this bumps into
the hard realism of creating sounds being difficult and requiring
skills I don't have.

</p>

<p>

For years I've tried to live my life so that if my computer died
tomorrow I wouldn't lose anything, and while that's true from a ""lose
data"" perspective it's far from true with a ""lose time"" perspective.

</p>

<p>
<br />

[1] Yesterday morning all the USB C ports on my MacBook stopped
working suddenly.  It rebooted itself out of nowhere and when it came
back it wouldn't charge, wouldn't talk to the external monitor, and of
course couldn't see my various MIDI devices.  It freezes and reboots
after running for 5-10min.  It will still charge when it's suspended,
so it's not quite dead, but it's pretty dead.

</p>

<p>

I tried <a href=""https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201295"">resetting
the SMC</a>, and the <a href=""https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204063"">NVRAM and PRAM</a>
without luck.

</p>

<p>

I have a long-term loan of an older Mac with a cracked screen, that I
usually use for recording.  The screen makes using it on its own
tricky, but now that I have an <a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/folding-couch-monitor"">external monitor I like</a> it's ok:

</p>

</p>

<p>

This post is from setting that up for music.

Let&apos;s do Machine Learning. </p><h1>Support Vector Machines</h1><p><em><strong>Support Vector Machines </strong></em>is an odd name for hyperplanes that are selected in a way that attempts to maximize the distance between the hyperplane and the nearest point(s). We differentiate between <em><strong>Hard Support Vector Machines </strong></em>which are hyperplanes that separate the instance space perfectly and where (among all hyperplanes which do that) the distance to the nearest point is maximal, and <em><strong>Soft Support Vector Machines </strong></em>which try to simultaneously maximize the distance to the nearest point(s) and the number of correctly classified points; without the assumption that they&apos;ll get the second one perfectly right. Thus, Hard Support Vector Machines only exist if the instance space is linearly separable, but Soft Support Vector Machines always exist.</p><h2>Illustrating the concept</h2><p>In the 2-dimensional classification problem depicted below,</p><span><figure><img src=""https://i.ibb.co/fMTZ40x/01.png"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:40%""></figure></span><p>both the black and the green hyperplanes classify all instances correctly, but only the green one is (approximately) a Hard Support Vector Machine, because the distance to the nearest points (dotted lines) is maximized. Note that for a true Hard Support Vector Machine, generally there will be a bunch of nearest points with identical distance (because if there was just one, then the hyperplane could very likely be moved in such a way that distance to that point increases while distance to other points might decrease, leading to a higher minimal distance). In two-dimensional space, there will likely be two such points. On the other hand, the black hyperplane is not a Hard Support Vector Machine, and indeed the minimal margin could be slightly improved by moving it to the bottom left, such that the margin to the nearest triangle decreases but that to the nearest circle increases.</p><p>Given that Hard Support Vector Machines have an extremely discontinuous &quot;caring function&quot; (i.e. only care about the distance to a couple of points and are entirely indifferent to all others), it is easy to construct examples where they look silly:</p><span><figure><img src=""https://i.ibb.co/4Thkspv/02.png"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:69%""></figure></span><p>You get the idea. The difference between Hard and Soft Support Vector Machines is somewhat analogous between the difference between committing to a hypothesis class ahead of time, and utilizing <em>Structural Risk Minimization</em> which has a weighting function over different hypothesis classes. In the above example, a Soft Support Vector Machine would probably bite the bullet and classify the one blue point incorrectly, in exchange for a much larger margin to the nearest correctly classified points.</p><h2>Distance between a point and a hyperplane </h2><p>In order to implement either form of Support Vector Machines, we need to know how to compute the distance between a point and a hyperplane.

NQQzXpahhkb6f6ZCe,On hiding the source of knowledge,on-hiding-the-source-of-knowledge,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NQQzXpahhkb6f6ZCe/on-hiding-the-source-of-knowledge,2020-01-26T02:48:51.310Z,120,44,40,False,False,https://unstableontology.com/2020/01/26/on-hiding-the-source-of-knowledge/,"<html><head></head><body><p>I notice that when I write for a public audience, I usually present ideas in a modernist, skeptical, academic style; whereas, the way I come up with ideas is usually in part by engaging in epistemic modalities that such a style has difficulty conceptualizing or considers illegitimate, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Advanced introspection and self-therapy (including focusing and meditation)</li>
<li>Mathematical and/or analogical intuition applied everywhere with only spot checks (rather than rigorous proof) used for confirmation</li>
<li>Identity hacking, including virtue ethics, shadow-eating, and applied performativity theory</li>
<li>Altered states of mind, including psychotic and near-psychotic experiences</li>
<li>Advanced cynicism and conflict theory, including generalization from personal experience</li>
<li>Political radicalism and cultural criticism</li>
<li>Eastern mystical philosophy (esp. Taoism, Buddhism, Tantra)</li>
<li>Literal belief in self-fulfilling prophecies, illegible spiritual phenomena, etc, sometimes with decision-theoretic and/or naturalistic interpretations</li>
</ul>
<p>This risks hiding where the knowledge actually came from. Someone could easily be mistaken into thinking they can do what I do, intellectually, just by being a skeptical academic.</p>
<p>I recall a conversation I had where someone (call them A) commented that some other person (call them B) had developed some ideas, then&nbsp;<em>afterwards</em> found academic sources agreeing with these ideas (or at least, seeming compatible), and cited these as sources in the blog post write-ups of these ideas. Person A believed that this was importantly bad in that it hides where the actual ideas came from, and assigned credit for them to a system that did not actually produce the ideas.</p>
<p>On the other hand, citing academics that agree with you is helpful to someone who is relying on academic peer-review as part of their epistemology. And, similarly, offering a rigorous proof is helpful for convincing someone of a mathematical principle they aren't already intuitively convinced of (in addition to constituting an extra check of this principle).</p>
<p>We can distinguish, then, the source of an idea from the presented epistemic justification of it. And the justificatory chain (to a skeptic) doesn't have to depend on the source. So, there is a temptation to simply present the justificatory chain, and hide the source. (Especially if the source is somehow embarrassing or delegitimized)</p>
<p>But, this creates a distortion, if people assume the justificatory chains are representative of the source. Information consumers may find themselves in an environment where claims are thrown around with various justifications, but where they would have quite a lot of difficulty coming up with and checking similar claims.</p>
<p>And, a lot of the time, the source&nbsp;<em>is</em> important in the justification, because the source was the original reason for privileging the hypothesis. Many things can be partially rationally justified without such partial justification being sufficient for credence, without also knowing something about the source. (The problems of skepticism in philosophy in part relate to this: ""but you have the intuition too, don't you?"" only works if the other person has the same intuition (and admits to it), and arguing without appeals to intuition is quite difficult)</p>
<p>In addition, even if the idea is justified,&nbsp;<em>the intuition itself</em>&nbsp;is an artifact of value; knowing abstractly that ""X"" does not imply the actual ability to, in real situations, quickly derive the implications of ""X"". And so, sharing the source of the original intuition is helpful to consumers, if it can be shared. Very general sources are even more valuable, since they allow for generation of new intuitions on the fly.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many such sources can't easily be shared. Some difficulties with doing so are essential and some are accidental. The essential difficulties have to do with the fact that teaching is hard; you can't assume the student already has the mental prerequisites to learn whatever you are trying to teach, as there is significant variation between different minds. The accidental difficulties have to do with social stigma, stylistic limitations, embarrassment, politics, privacy of others, etc.</p>
<p>Some methods for attempting to share such intuitions may result in text that seems personal and/or poetic, and be out of place in a skeptical academic context. This is in large part because such text isn't trying to justify itself by the skeptical academic standards, and is nevertheless attempting to communicate something.</p>
<p>Noticing this phenomenon has led me to more appreciate forewards and prefaces of books. These sections often discuss more of the messiness of idea-development than the body of the book does. There may be a nice stylistic way of doing something similar for blog posts; perhaps, an extended bibliography that includes free-form text.</p>
<p>I don't have a solution to this problem at the moment. However, I present this phenomenon as a problem, in the spirit of discussing problems before proposing solutions. I hope it is possible to reduce the accidental difficulties in sharing sources of knowledge, and actually-try on the essential difficulties, in a way that greatly increases the rate of interpersonal model-transfer.</p>

We get bored. If we don’t get bored, we still don’t like the idea of joy without variety. And joyful experiences only seems good if they are real and meaningful (in some sense we can’t easily pin down). And so on.</p><p>On the flip side, creating really bad outcomes seems much easier, running into none of the symmetric “problems.” So what gives?</p><p>I’ll argue that nature is basically out to get us, and it’s not a coincidence that making things good is so much harder than making them bad.</p><h2>First: some other explanations</h2><p>Two common answers (e.g. see <a href=""http://reflectivedisequilibrium.blogspot.com/2012/03/are-pain-and-pleasure-equally-energy.html"">here</a> and comments):</p><ul><li>The worst things that can quickly happen to an animal in nature are much worse than the best things that can quickly happen.</li><li>It’s easy to kill or maim an animal, but hard to make things go well, so “random” experiences are more likely to be bad than good.</li></ul><p>I think both of these are real, but that the consideration in this post is at least as important.</p><h2>Main argument: reward errors are asymmetric</h2><p>Suppose that I’m building an RL agent who I want to achieve some goal in the world. I can imagine different kinds of errors:</p><ul><li><strong>Pessimism</strong>: the rewards are too low. Maybe the agent gets a really low reward even though nothing bad happened.</li><li><strong>Optimism</strong>: the rewards are too high. Maybe the agent gets a really high reward even though nothing good happened, or gets no reward even though something bad happened.</li></ul><p><i>Pessimistic</i> errors are no big deal. The agent will randomly avoid behaviors that get penalized, but as long as those behaviors are reasonably rare (and aren’t the only way to get a good outcome) then that’s not too costly.</p><p>But&nbsp;<i>optimistic</i> errors are catastrophic. The agent will systematically seek out the behaviors that receive the high reward, and will use loopholes to avoid penalties when something actually bad happens. So even if these errors are extremely rare initially, they can totally mess up my agent.</p><p>When we try to create suffering by going off distribution, evolution doesn’t really care. It didn’t build the machinery to be robust.</p><p>But when we try to create incredibly good stable outcomes, we are fighting an adversarial game against evolution. Every animal forever has been playing that game using all the tricks it could learn, and evolution has patched every hole that they found.</p><p>In order to win this game, evolution can implement general strategies like boredom, or an aversion to meaningless pleasures. Each of these measures makes it harder for us to inadvertently find a loophole that gets us high reward.</p><h2>Implications</h2><p>Overall I think this is a relatively optimistic view: some of our asymmetrical intuitions about pleasure and pain may be miscalibrated for a world where we are able to outsmart evolution. I think evolution’s tricks just mean that creating good worlds is <i>difficult</i> rather than&nbsp;<i>impossible</i>, and that we will be able to create an incredibly good world as we become wiser.</p><p>It’s possible that evolution solved the overoptimism problem in a way that is actually universal—such that it is in fact <i>impossible</i> to create outcomes as good as the worst outcomes are bad.

That makes it a much better deal for the nobles (until the total income of nobles is roughly equal to the total income of peasants).</li></ol><p>In this situation, let’s call redistribution a “moral public good.” The nobles are altruistic enough that they prefer it if everyone gives to the peasants, but it’s still not worth it for any given noble to contribute anything to the collective project.</p><p>The rest of the post is about some implications of taking moral public good seriously.</p><h2>1. Justifying redistribution</h2><p>This gives a very strong economic argument for state redistribution: it can easily be the case that <i>every individual </i>prefers a world with high redistribution to the world with low redistribution, rich and poor alike. I think “everyone prefers this policy” is basically the strongest argument you can make on its behalf.</p><p>(In fact some people just don’t care about others and so not <i>everyone</i> will benefit. I’d personally be on board with the purely selfish people just not funding redistribution, but unfortunately you can’t just ask people if they want to pay more taxes and I’m not going to sweat it that much if the most selfish people lose out a little bit.)</p><p>I think this argument supports levels of redistribution like 50% (or 30% or 70% or whatever), rather than levels of redistribution like 99% that could nearly level the playing field or ensure that no billionaires exist. I think this enough to capture the vast majority of the possible benefits from redistribution, e.g. they could get most households to &gt;50% of the average consumption.</p><p>This argument supports both foreign aid and domestic redistribution, but the foreign aid component may require international coordination. For example, if everyone in developed countries cared equally about themselves, their country, and the world, then you might end up with optimal domestic policies allocating 10% of their redistribution abroad (much less in smaller countries who have minimal influence on global poverty, a little bit more in the US), whereas everyone would prefer a multilateral commitment to spend 50% of their redistribution abroad.</p><h2>2. There are lots of public goods</h2><p>I think it makes sense for states to directly fund moral public goods like existential risk mitigation, exploration, ecological preservation, arts and sciences, animal welfare improvements, <i>etc</i>. In the past I’ve thought it usually made more sense to just give people money and let them decide how to spend it. (I still think states and philanthropists should more often give people cash, I just now think the presumption is less strong.)</p><p>In fact, I think that at large scales (like a nation rather than a town) moral public goods are probably the majority of public goods. Caring slightly more about public goods slightly changed my perspective on the state’s role. It also makes me significantly more excited about mechanisms like quadratic funding for public goods.</p><p>I enjoyed David Friedman’s <i>The Machinery of Freedom</i>, but it repeats the common libertarian line that donations can help the poor just as well as taxes:</p><blockquote><p>If almost everyone is in favor of feeding the hungry, the politician may find it in his interest to do so. But, under those circumstances, the politician is unnecessary: some kind soul will give the hungry man a meal anyway. If the great majority is against the hungry man, some kind soul among the minority still may feed him—the politician will not.</p></blockquote><p>This seems totally wrong. The use of coercive force is an active ingredient in the state feeding the hungry, as it is with other public good provision. Anarchists either need to make some speculative proposal to fund public goods (the current menu isn’t good!) or else need to accept the pareto inefficiency of underfunding moral public goods like redistribution.</p><h2>3. Altruism is not about consequentialism</h2><p>Consequentialism is a really bad model for most people’s altruistic behavior, and especially their compromises between altruistic and selfish ends. To model someone as a thoroughgoing consequentialist, you have two bad options:</p><ol><li>They care about themselves &gt;10 million times as much as other people. Donating to almost anything is in insane, no way the recipient values the money 10 million times more than I do.</li><li>They care about themselves &lt;1% as much as everyone else in the whole world put together. When choosing between possible worlds, they would gladly give up their whole future in order to make everyone else’s life a little better. Their personal preferences are nearly irrelevant when picking policies. If they found themselves in a very powerful position they would become radically more altruistic.</li></ol><p>I think neither of these is a great model. In fact it seems like people care a lot about themselves and those around them, but at the same time, they are willing to donate small amounts of their income.</p><p>You could try to frame this as “no one is altruistic, it’s just a sham” or “people are terrible at morality.” But I think you’ll understand most people’s altruism better if you think about it as part of a collective action or public goods provision problem. People want to e.g. see a world free from extreme poverty, and they are (sometimes) willing to chip in a small part of that vision for the same reason that they are willing to chip in to the local public park—even though the actual consequence of their donation is too small for them to care much about it.</p><p>On this perspective, donating to local charities is on much more even footing with donating to distant strangers. Both are contributions to public goods, just at different scales and of different types, and that’s the thing that most unifies the way people approach and think about them. The consequentialist analysis is still relevant—helping the poor is only a moral public good because of the consequences—but it’s not that the local charity is just a consequentialist error.</p><p>In addition to misunderstanding normal humans, I think consequentialists sometimes make related errors in their own judgments. If a bunch of utilitarians want to enjoy a nice communal space, it’s worthwhile for each of them to help fund it even though it neither makes sense on utilitarian grounds nor for their own self-interests. That’s a good norm that can leave every utilitarian better off than if they’d spent the same money selfishly. I think that a lot of moral intuition and discourse is about this kind of coordination, and if you forget about that then you will both be confused by normal moral discourse and also fail to solve some real problems that everyday morality is designed to solve.</p></body></html>",paulfchristiano,paulfchristiano,paulfchristiano,

There&#x2019;s no intentional information-hoarding, it&#x2019;s just that the marketing and sales people don&#x2019;t sit next to each other or talk very often. Even if the info were shared, it would need to be translated to a format usable by the salespeople.</li><li>Various hard problems in analysis of large-scale biological data likely have close analogues in econometrics. The econometricians have good methods to solve the problems, and would probably be quite happy to apply those methods to biological data, and the bio experimentalists would love some analytic help. But these people hardly ever talk to each other, and use different language for the same things anyway.</li><li>When the US invaded Grenada in the &#x2018;80&#x2019;s, the marines occupied one side of the island and the army occupied the other. Their radios were not compatible, so if an army officer needed to contact their counterpart in the marines, they had to walk to the nearest pay phone and get routed through Fort Bragg on commercial telephone lines.</li><li>Various US intelligence agencies had all of the pieces necessary to stop the 9/11 attacks. There were agencies which knew something was planned for that day, and knew who the actors were. There were agencies which knew the terrorists were getting on the planes. There were agencies which could have moved to stop them, but unfortunately the fax(!) from the agencies which knew what was happening wasn&#x2019;t checked in time.</li><li>There are about 300 million people in the US. If I have a small company producing doilies, chances are there are plenty of people in the US alone who&#x2019;d love my doilies and be happy to pay for them. But it&#x2019;s hard to figure out exactly which people those are, and even once that&#x2019;s done it&#x2019;s hard to get them a message showing off my product. And even if all that works out, if the customers really want a slightly different pattern, it&#x2019;s hard for them to communicate back to me what they want - even if I&#x2019;d be happy to make it.</li></ul><p>So coordination problems are a constraint to production of all kinds of economic value. How taut are those constraints?</p><p>Well, let&#x2019;s look at the market price of relaxing coordination constraints. In other words: how much do people/companies get paid for solving coordination problems?</p><p>When I think of people whose <em>main</em> job is to solve coordination problems, here are some occupations which spring to mind:</p><ul><li>Entrepreneurs&#x2019; main job is to coordinate salespeople, engineers, designers, marketers, investors, customers, regulators, suppliers, shippers, etc&#x2026;</li><li>Managers&#x2019; main job is to coordinate between their bosses, underlings, and across departments</li><li>Investment bankers coordinate between investors, companies, lawyers, and a huge number of people within each of those organizations</li><li>Real estate developers coordinate between builders, landowners, regulators, renters, and investors</li></ul><p>Note that all of these are occupations typically associated with very high pay. Even more to the point: within each of these occupations, people who solve more complicated coordination problems (e.g. between more people) tend to make more money. Even at the small end, the main difference between an employee and a freelancer is that the freelancer has to solve their own coordination problem (i.e. find people who want their services); freelancers make lots of money mainly when they are very good at solving this problem.</p><p>Similarly with companies. If we go down the list of tech unicorns, most (though not all) of them solve coordination problems as their primary business model:</p><ul><li>Google matches company websites to potentially interested users</li><li>Facebook is a general-purpose coordination platform</li><li>Amazon and Ebay are general-purpose marketplaces: they match buyers to sellers</li><li>Uber/Lyft are more specialized marketplaces</li></ul><p>Again: solving coordination problems at scale offers huge amounts of money.</p><p>This suggests that coordination problems are <em>very</em> taut constraints in today&#x2019;s economy.</p><p>It&#x2019;s not hard to imagine <em>why</em> coordination problems would be very taut today. Over the past ~50 years, global travel/transportation has gone from rare to ordinary, and global communication has become cheap and ubiquitous. Geographical constraints have largely been relaxed, and communication/information processing constraints have largely been relaxed. The number of people we <em>could</em> potentially coordinate with has expanded massively as a result - a small doily business can now sell to a national or even global customer base; a phone app can connect any willing driver in a city to any paying rider.</p><p>Yet human brains have not changed much, even as the number of people we interact with skyrockets past Dunbar&#x2019;s number. It&#x2019;s hard for humans to coordinate with thousands - let alone billions - of other humans. The coordination constraint remains, so as other constraints relax, it becomes more taut.</p><h2>What Would This Model Predict?</h2><p>One prediction: suppose I&#x2019;ve decided to become a freelancer/consultant. I can invest effort in becoming better at my object-level craft, or I can invest effort in becoming better at solving my coordination problem - e.g. by exploring marketing channels or studying my target market. Which of these will make more money? Probably the latter - coordination constraints are <em>very</em> taut, so there&#x2019;s lots of money to be made by relaxing them.</p><p>More generally, when evaluating new business ideas, questions on my short list include:</p><ul><li>How will this business find people who would want to buy the product?</li><li>How will this business make those people aware of the product?</li></ul><p>To the extent that coordination is an unusually taut constraint, answers to these questions will be the main determinant of business profitability - even more so than product quality.</p><p>Coming from a different direction, when considering a business idea we should ask how many different kinds of people this business needs to coordinate. At one point I worked at a mortgage startup, where the list of internal departments included marketing, sales, underwriting, legal, and capital markets on the mortgage side, plus design, engineering, and ops on the tech side, and on top of that we had to interface to at least a dozen external companies on a regular basis. Coordination is <em>the</em> primary constraint at a company like that.</p><p>Yet another direction: if coordination constraints are very taut, then we expect adoption of technology which makes coordination easier. One form of this is outlined in <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/sYt3ZCrBq2QAf3rak/from-personal-to-prison-gangs-enforcing-prosocial-behavior"">From Personal to Prison Gangs</a></u>: people make <em>themselves</em> easier to coordinate with, by following standardized patterns of behavior and fitting into standard molds. For instance, in large organizations (where more people need to coordinate) we tend to see group-based identity: rather than understanding what John or Allan does, people understand what lawyers or developers do. Interactions between people become more standardized, and roles more rigid - these are solutions to coordination problems. Such solutions entail large tradeoffs, but coordination constraints are very taut, so large tradeoffs are accepted.</p><p>Conversely, if we want a world with less pressure to standardize behavior, then we need some other way to relax coordination constraints - some technology which helps people coordinate at scale without needing to standardize behavior as much. Such technology would probably see wide adoption, and potentially make quite a lot of money as well.</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>I often hear people they&#x2019;d like object-level skill/effort to be rewarded more than marketing/sales, or they&#x2019;d like to see less pressure to standardize behavior, or they&#x2019;d like the world to be more individualized and identity to be less group-based. To the extent that we buy the picture here, all of these phenomena are solutions to coordination problems. Society rewards marketing over object-level skill, and tries to standardize behavior, because coordination constraints are extremely taut.</p><p>If we want the world to look less like that, then we need alternative scalable technologies to solve coordination problems.</p>",johnswentworth,johnswentworth,johnswentworth,

Any good can be copied and shared with friends, for free. All material needs can be satisfied with the push of a button.

When it comes to digital goods, like music or videos, the world of the duplicator is exactly the world in which we now live. That’s the obvious parallel, but let’s not stop there.</p><p>Over time, the value of raw materials and manufacturing have steadily fallen as a fraction of economic output. Even when looking at material goods, efficiency has shifted the bulk of costs from materials and manufacturing to design and engineering. We are converging to the world of the duplicator, where marginal production costs hit zero, and in many areas we’re already most of the way there.</p><p>In terms of <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/xEFeCwk3pdYdeG2rL/p/DMopaHKS79aGMmLkA"">constraints &amp; slackness</a>: constraints involving material goods are going slack, across the board. We’re approaching a post-scarcity world, at least with respect to most material goods.</p><p>This hasn’t made economic activity disappear. Pulling from the story again:</p><blockquote>This morning, we had an economy of scarcity. Tonight, we have an economy of abundance. And yet, it doesn't seem to make much difference, it is still the same old rat race.</blockquote><p>Why? Because material goods are not the only economic constraints. If a medieval book-maker has an unlimited pile of parchment, then he’ll be limited by the constraint on transcriptionists. As material goods constraints are relaxed, other constraints become taut.</p><p>So… what general kinds of constraints become taut, in a world where material goods are cheap?</p><h2>Badge Value</h2><p>Here’s one good you can’t just throw on a duplicator: a college degree.</p><p>A college degree is more than just words on paper. It’s a badge, a mark of achievement. You can duplicate the badge, but that won’t duplicate the achievement.</p><p>Rory Sutherland is another great source for understanding the modern economy. The main message of his<u><a href=""https://www.ted.com/talks/rory_sutherland_life_lessons_from_an_ad_man""> classic TED talk</a></u> is that much of the value in today’s economy is not “material” value, i.e. the actual cost of making a good, but “intangible” or “badge” value. A college degree is an extreme example, but the principle applies to varying degrees in many places.</p><p>The sticker price on an iphone or a pair of converse isn’t driven by their material cost. A pair of canvas high-top sneakers without a converse logo is worth less than a pair of converse, because converse are a social symbol, a signal of one’s personal identity. Clothes, cars, computers and phones, furniture, music, even food - the things we buy all come with social signals as a large component of their value. That’s intangible value.</p><p>In the world of the duplicator, the world to which our economy is converging, badge value is the lion’s share of the value of many goods. That’s because, no matter how much production costs fall, no matter how low material costs drop, we can’t duplicate intangible value - in particular, we can’t duplicate social status. Material goods constraints go slack, but status constraints remain, so they become taut.</p><h2>Keeping Up with the Joneses</h2><p>The general problem with badge value, and signalling in general, is that a badge isn’t worth anything if everybody has it. In order for a badge to be worth something, there have to be people without the badge. It’s a zero sum game.</p><p><u><a href=""https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspicuousConsumption?from=Main.KeepingUpWithTheJoneses"">Keeping up with the Joneses</a></u> is a classic example: people buy things to signal their high status, but then all their neighbors buy the same thing. They’re all back to where they started in terms of status, but everyone has less money.</p><p>Interesting claim: the prevalence of zero-sum signalling today economically stems from the reduction of material scarcity. If you think about it, zero-sum games are inherent to a so-called post-scarcity society. A positive sum game implies that net production of something is possible. That, in turn, implies that something was scarce to begin with. Without scarcity, what is there to produce?</p><p>To put it differently: there’s always going to be something scarce. Take away material scarcity, and you’re left with scarcity of status. If there’s no way to produce net status, you’re left with a zero-sum game. More generally, remove scarcity of whatever can be produced, and you’re left with scarcity of things which do not allow net production at all - zero sum goods.</p><p>The way out, of course, is to relax the constraint on supposedly-zero-sum goods. In other words, find a way to produce net status. Two important points:</p><ul><li>We’re talking about relaxing an economic constraint - that’s what technology does. In this case, it would presumably be a social technology, though possibly with some mechanical/digital components.</li><li>Assuming we buy the argument that status constraints are taut, we’d expect status-producing technology to see broad adoption.</li></ul><p>In particular, <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/T5W2xiQ6KZyEHDvEk/we-can-all-be-high-status?commentId=P4tzAKTD5hY2K7NHn"">various people</a></u> have noted that net status can be produced by creating more subcultures, each with their own status-measures. The baristas at <u><a href=""https://sightglasscoffee.com/"">SightGlass coffee</a></u> have very high status among hipsters, but hardly any status with economists.<u><a href=""https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/yellen.htm""> Janet Yellen</a></u> has very high status among economists, but hardly any status with hipsters. Each different culture has its own internal status standards, allowing people to have high status within some culture even if they have low status in others. As long as having high status in the cultures one cares about is more important than low status in other cultures, that’s a net gain.</p><p>Based on this, we’d predict that subcultures will proliferate, even just using already-available subculture-producing technology. We’d also predict rapid adoption of new technology which helps people produce new subcultures and status measures.</p><h2>Rent Seeking</h2><p>With all this talk of zero-sum games, the last piece of the post-scarcity puzzle should come as no surprise: <u><a href=""https://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/RentSeeking.html"">political rent-seeking</a></u>.</p><p>Once we accept that economics does not disappear in the absence of material scarcity, that there will always be something scarce, we immediately need to worry about people creating artificial scarcity to claim more wealth. This is the domain of political rent-seeking, of trying to limit market entry via political channels.</p><p>One simple way to measure such activity is via lobbying expenditures, especially by businesses. Such spending actually seems to have flattened out in the last decade, but it’s still multiple orders of magnitude higher than it was fifty years ago.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Remove material goods as a taut economic constraint, and what do you get? The same old rat race. Material goods no longer scarce? Sell intangible value. Sell status signals. There will always be a taut constraint somewhere.</p><p>Between steady growth in industrial productivity and the advent of the digital era, today’s world looks much more like the world of the duplicator than like the world of 1958. Yet many people are still stuck in 1950’s-era economic thinking. At the end of the day, economics studies scarcity (via constraints, slackness, and prices). Even in the world of the duplicator, where any material good is arbitrarily abundant, scarcity still exists.</p><p>This is the world in which we live: as material and manufacturing costs fall, badge value constitutes a greater and greater fraction of overall value. Status games become more important. Politically, less material scarcity means more investment in creating artificial scarcity, through political barriers to market entry.</p>",johnswentworth,johnswentworth,johnswentworth,

We introduced the hypothesis that this was a major cause (though not a <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/d4DvqS88Q29ZaJAj3/homeostasis-and-root-causes-in-aging"">root cause</a></u>) of the failure of China to automate and, by extension, the failure of China to kick-start the industrial revolution. More importantly, we introduced some simple first-pass ways to test this hypothesis: go look at market prices of labor and capital in medieval/renaissance China and Europe.</p><p>We did <em>not</em> go into depth actually testing that hypothesis, nor will we. Instead, we're going to go up a meta-level, and generalize this whole technique. We have a very general hypothesis about the large-scale historical evolution of China compared to Europe. It’s part of a whole worldview, in which the central gear - the central mediating factor - is the scarcity of capital relative to labor. What’s the process which generates this sort of hypothesis? Can we generalize it, to generate other broad worldviews?</p><p>Here's the idea, in 4.5 steps.</p><p><u>Step 1: Pick a General Resource/Constraint</u></p><p>Pick some very general resource, which serves as an input to production in a wide variety of areas. Our China/Europe example mainly considers capital as the resource (though we also use labor as a baseline for comparison in this case). Other important examples in economic history include transportation, energy, and fertile land. More modern and abstract examples might include research/innovation, communication/coordination, signals of status/virtue/intelligence, or material goods as a whole.</p><p><u>Step 2: Qualitative Analysis</u></p><p>Reason qualitatively about what would happen as the constraint becomes more taut/slack. What technologies (machines, contracts, organizational structures, etc) would be adopted? What would happen to market prices? What other constraints would become more/less slack as a result?</p><p>For instance, as capital constraints become more taut, we expect to see more people performing tasks which could be performed by machines (i.e. not adopting capital-intensive technology), and we expect returns on capital investments to be higher (i.e. higher market price of capital). When capital constraints become more slack, we expect the opposite.</p><p><u>Step 3: Compare to the Real World</u></p><p>Compare real-world observations (market prices, technology actually used) to our predictions to figure out (qualitatively) how taut/slack the constraint actually is, across many different industries.</p><p>In the China/Europe example, we can do this by looking at adoption of capital-intensive technologies (i.e. textile machinery, water mills, automation in general) or by looking at market prices of capital (i.e. rate of return on investments).</p><p><u>Step 3.5: Sanity Check</u></p><p>If our hypothesized constraint is actually the right gear for this model, then we should see similar tautness/slackness in different industries - e.g. we shouldn’t see a relevant technology adopted in one industry but not another, or different industries paying radically different market prices to relax the constraint.</p><p>In the China/Europe example, we should check that there actually is a broad pattern of China using labor on tasks where Europe used machines. This doesn’t mean China didn’t use <em>any</em> machines - our comparisons are relative, we’re thinking about more/less at the margin - but we should at least see the difference across many different industries. Similarly, we should check that capital investments had higher economic returns in China across whatever industries the Chinese invested in (though it may be that investors had a tough time capturing those returns… another potential gear in our model).</p><p>This should give us some idea of how generally-relevant our constraint is, in practice.</p><p><u>Step 4: Generalize</u></p><p>What other qualitative predictions can we make, beyond what we’ve already observed?</p><p>If we’re thinking about new technologies or new business ideas, to what extent do we expect them to be enabled/blocked by slackness/tautness of the constraint? What other constraints do we expect to become more taut/slack in response to this one? Is the constraint becoming more taut/slack over time? If so, what changes do we expect that trend to induce?</p><p>If you want a quick exercise in this, consider computational capacity as the constraint. You’ve probably already heard plenty about how the tautness of that constraint has changed over time, what new technologies have been adopted as a result, and what other constraints have become taut/slack as a result. Can you translate that information into the language of constraints/slackness/prices? Does the constraints/slackness/prices framework suggest other questions to ask, or new predictions to make?</p><h2>Applications</h2><p>We've already talked a bit about two resources to which this framework applies: labor and capital. One can build a whole worldview this way, and much of macroeconomics does exactly that - see MRU’s videos on the <u><a href=""https://mru.org/courses/principles-economics-macroeconomics/solow-model-economic-growth"">Solow model</a></u> for a friendly starting point to the macro models.</p><p>There are many other very generic inputs we could think about. The next two posts discuss two other general constraints:</p><ul><li><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/xEFeCwk3pdYdeG2rL/p/eWxizGwgpNhckrzfc"">Manufactured goods</a>. Across the board, real prices of most manufactured goods have fallen dramatically over the past two centuries - suggesting those constraints are relatively slack today. Yet that does not mean that we live in a world of total material abundance. What would we expect a world of slack material constraints to look like? What other constraints would become taut?</li><li><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/xEFeCwk3pdYdeG2rL/p/P6fSj3t4oApQQTB7E"">Coordination</a>. Producing and selling goods or services requires coordinating salespeople, engineers, designers, marketers, investors, customers, regulators, suppliers, shippers, etc, etc. Jobs which have the potential for making very large amounts of money - e.g. entrepreneurship, management, investment banking, mergers &amp; acquisitions, etc - are largely characterized by being <em>primarily</em> about coordination. Similarly, if we look at the list of highly successful tech companies over the past 25 years - Google, Facebook, Amazon, Uber/Lyft... - the primary business of most (though not all) of them is to solve some particular coordination problem. Both of these suggest a very taut constraint.</li></ul><p>Some other examples which I might explore in future posts:</p><ul><li><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/xEFeCwk3pdYdeG2rL/p/4s2gbwMHSdh2SByyZ"">Transportation</a>. Before the modern era, pack animals’ food &amp; water requirements sharply limited the range of overland transport, especially in arid regions. This constraint shaped the paths of armies and locations of cities, suggesting a very taut constraint. How taut was the transportation constraint historically, and how taut is it today? What would the world look like with a totally slack transportation constraint?</li><li><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/xEFeCwk3pdYdeG2rL/p/hyShz2ABiKX56j5tJ"">Interfaces</a>. If Alice wants to produce something for Bob, then first they must accurately communicate to Alice what Bob wants. Some interesting cases:</li><ul><li>Alice is a company, Bob is a customer</li><li>Alice is a computer, Bob is a programmer/product designer/user</li><li>Alice is an employee, Bob is an employer</li><li>Bob is <u><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Design-Everyday-Things-Revised-Expanded/dp/0465050654/"">Don Norman</a></u>, Alice is a fridge. Yes, a fridge. We'll get to that.</li></ul></ul><p>How taut/slack are communication/translation constraints, in general?</p><ul><li><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/hqSuo8ERcPw6nre2o/theory-and-data-as-constraints"">Theory and data</a>, especially in the sciences. In the past few decades, a number of fields (e.g. biology, economics, and many industries) have built up massive piles of data. Yet the ability to turn that data into useful knowledge and insights - i.e. theory - has lagged behind.</li></ul><p>Also, there might be another post going into more depth on capital, especially on the main places where capital is deployed today.</p>",johnswentworth,johnswentworth,johnswentworth,

(mathematically given by the Lagrange multiplier). The price indicates how &quot;taut&quot; or &quot;slack&quot; the constraint is - i.e. how much more we can produce if the constraint is relaxed a little bit. If we&apos;re a medieval book-maker with 15 sheep and a thousand transcriptionist-years on hand, then the sheep constraint is very taut (more sheep means more books), whereas the transcriptionist constraint is very slack (more transcriptionists does nothing). It&apos;s like a rope: pulling on a rope won&apos;t do anything unless the rope is taut; hiring more transcriptionists won&apos;t do anything unless the transcriptionist constraint is taut. The shadow price quantifies this: it tells us how much the book-maker will pay for additional sheep versus additional transcriptionists. With 15 sheep and a thousand transcriptionist-years, the book-maker will happily pay for more sheep, but will offer roughly zero for more transcriptionists.</p><p>Quick recap:</p><ul><li>abundant resource = slack constraint = extra input won&apos;t produce much/any extra output &lt;=&gt; producer won&apos;t pay for more input = low shadow price of input</li><li>scarce resource = taut constraint = extra input will produce extra output &lt;=&gt; producer will pay for more input = high shadow price of input</li></ul><p>If you want to see the math, I highly recommend Stephen Boyd&apos;s <u><a href=""https://see.stanford.edu/Course/EE364A"">lectures</a></u> &amp; <u><a href=""https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/bv_cvxbook.pdf"">book</a></u> on convex optimization.</p><p>So what does all this tell us about technology changes?</p><p>Well, new technology removes some constraints and replaces them with new constraints. If the old constraint is slack, then this doesn&apos;t do any good. If we already have a million transcriptionist-hours available, and only 15 sheep, then we have no use for a printing press. Consider <u><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bi_Sheng"">Pi Cheng</a></u>: he introduced a movable-type printing press in China around 1045, but it mostly failed to catch on. Why? </p><p>Here&apos;s one hypothesis: across the board, in many different industries, we see medieval/renaissance China using labor in places where Europe used machines. That suggests that labor, in general, was readily available in China - those constraints were generally slack. Labor in China had a very low shadow price, compared to the shadow price of machinery (i.e. capital goods).</p><p>How could we test that hypothesis?</p><p>Economic theory provides various conditions under which producers&apos; shadow prices are (roughly) equal to market prices. The simplest such condition is competition, but that assumption usually degrades gracefully: even if competition is less-than-perfect, market prices will still usually <em>approximate</em> shadow prices, with the approximation improving as competition increases. So one rough measure of a shadow price is the market price. (Even when the competition assumption fails completely, we can probe the shadow price in other ways - e.g. by looking directly at producers&apos; records, or by looking at how hard producers try to obtain various inputs.)</p><p>If competition among book-makers is even remotely reasonable as an approximation, then the book-makers&apos; shadow prices will be close to market prices of the relevant goods. So, we could (very roughly) test our hypothesis by comparing the price of labor relative to capital in medieval/renaissance China to the price of labor relative to capital in medieval/renaissance Europe. Our hypothesis predicts that labor was much cheaper relative to capital in China.</p><h2>Generalization &amp; Gears</h2><p>Of course, there are many other possible hypotheses about why movable-type printing didn&#x2019;t catch on in China. A similar approach would apply to other possible hypotheses about the adoption of the press.</p><p>For instance, in Europe at least the replacement of parchment with paper is often cited as a key factor, suggesting that <em>before</em> the press was adopted, the parchment constraint was much more taut than the transcription constraint - i.e. parchment was a much larger share of the book&#x2019;s price than transcription. Only after the parchment constraint was relaxed did the transcription constraint become more taut, at which point the press caught on.</p><p>Note that, in both the capital/labor hypothesis and the paper hypothesis, we don&#x2019;t have a <em>root</em> cause. If prices were different, then some upstream factor must have caused the price difference. Rather, constraints/slackness/prices are <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/gvK5QWRLk3H8iqcNy/gears-vs-behavior"">gears in our model of the world</a></u>: each constraint/price pair is a gear, which can mediate the causal influence of a wide variety of interventions/root causes.</p><p>These gears can interact with each other - the &#x201C;output&#x201D; in one constraint may be an &#x201C;input&#x201D; in another. For instance, yet another hypothesis for China&#x2019;s non-adoption of movable-type printing is a relative lack of literacy in China; Europe had a much larger market for books. At an economic level, the supply of books was itself a slack constraint in China - people weren&#x2019;t willing to pay much for more books. This constraint would interact with both the capital constraint and the paper constraint - e.g. if few people read books, then there would be little demand for more scalable technologies like printing and paper. Book price/constraint would be a separate gear in the model, alongside the capital, labor, and paper prices/constraints.</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>In general, we can reason about the adoption and impact of new technology by looking at prices associated with constraints. If a technology relaxes a slack constraint, then it likely won&apos;t be adopted at all, and won&apos;t have much impact on total output even if it is adopted. On the other hand, technology which relaxes a taut constraint likely will be adopted, and have a large impact on total output - assuming that the technology doesn&apos;t introduce an even more restrictive constraint! (Conversely, though, <u><a href=""https://equilibriabook.com/"">generalized efficient markets</a></u> says that new technology which relaxes a taut constraint will be harder to discover in the first place - there was already an incentive to pick the low-hanging fruit.)</p>",johnswentworth,johnswentworth,johnswentworth,

It was claimed last time that maze levels and the danger of mazes was lower in the past than it is now, and that overall maze levels have been rising, as measured both by maze levels within organizations across the board, and maze levels within the overall society.</p>
<p>The world is better for people than it was back then. There are many things that have improved. This is not one of them.</p>
<p>I am confident this is the case and have pointed to ways to see it. I recognize that I have in no way <em>proven </em>this is the case. I don’t have a way to do that. Rather I am relying on your own observations and analysis. If you disagree, I hope the discussion that follows will still prove useful as a comparison to what you see as an alternate possible scenario where these dynamics are less toxic.</p>
<p>Now we ask what may have been different in the past, and whether we can duplicate those causes.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><b>Why was it different? Can we duplicate those causes?</b></h3>
<p>The sketched model suggests several causes. </p>
<p>One can model this as a two-level problem. Something happens (e.g. technological change) resulting in a change in circumstances (e.g. more real need for large organizations, cause one), which then causes higher overall maze levels. </p>
<p>Since this question asks for potential action on a large scale, political proposals will need to be among the proposals discussed. Let us do our best to debate models and how the gears in them work, and stay away from actual politics. To that end, <i>I am</i> <i>not claiming any of these policies are good ideas and should be implemented, or bad and should not be implemented. </i>I am only claiming that they would have particular physical results in the world. If they are obviously good or bad ideas, I shouldn’t need to say so. </p>
<p><b>Cause 1: More Real Need For Large Organizations</b></p>
<p>Modern life has larger organizations with more levels of hierarchy. Corporations are bigger. Governments are bigger. Political organizations are bigger. Universities are bigger. They wrap that bigness in more levels of hierarchy than ever before, with increasing amounts of bureaucracy and administration.</p>
<p>Jobs are done that previously did not get done. Where the same job persists, that same job takes more people. </p>
<p>There is little doubt that <em>some </em>of the problem is caused by the increased complexity of real needs. What is difficult is figuring out how much is necessary versus how much is unnecessary.</p>
<p>Do we see these bigger organizations mostly because technological and economic development requires it? Or do we mostly see bigger organizations because maze-supporting behaviors and rules have made it so? </p>
<p>How much of what goes on in a large organization is bullshit, and could be eliminated, shrinking its size? </p>
<p>How much of needing a large organization is due to regulation and subsidy? How much of this additional size and regulation is due to additional demands for safety, either real safety or the illusion of safety? </p>
<p>How much is our unwillingness to let ‘too big to fail’ organizations fail, and the perception that size is necessary, good and/or prestigious?</p>
<p>To the extent that this is the problem, we are <em>mostly </em>stuck. We can still make different trade-offs, since we can give up some of the additional complexity and its benefits to reduce the large-organization costs paid, but there are no easy wins to be had here.</p>
<p>My low confidence belief is that this accounts for a substantial portion of the problem, but less than half. It would be foolish precision to give a more exact number.</p>
<p><b>Cause 2: Laws and Regulations Favor Large Organizations</b></p>
<p>There is genuine need for larger organizations with more levels of hierarchy. But once you create those organizations, they have a logic of their own that generates further need for them. Those within these organizations steer conditions in their direction. A lot of the bigger organizations are there because they are structurally advantaged because they enjoy regulatory capture, or because of other barriers to smaller competition, rather than because being larger make any economic sense.</p>
<p>While we were making life harder for the small, we made life easier for the large. We removed technological and legal costs and barriers to larger organizations of all kinds. The friction caused by those costs previously ensured that big organizations only existed when there was a big payoff. Now we can also get them because of mission creep, because it gives people making the decisions more power, or often because someone’s ego gets stroked by the idea. </p>
<p>We were so busy figuring out how we could go big, we didn’t stop to ask whether we should.</p>
<p>As opposed to doing new things, where we are now so busy asking whether we should we no longer stop to ask whether we could.</p>
<p><b>Cause 3: Less Disruption of Existing Organizations</b></p>
<p>Wars, natural disasters, economic collapses and other large negative shocks are the standard historical method of preventing large organizations from hanging around for too long.  </p>
<p>Fortunately, we’ve managed to mostly avoid major destructive wars for some time. Natural disasters are not the threat they once were. While we had an economic collapse of sorts in 2008, it was nothing like the Great Depression. The title of one of the definitive books on that crisis, and the one I read to better understand it, was literally <em><a href=""https://smile.amazon.com/Too-Big-Fail-Washington-System/dp/0143118242/ref=sr_1_1?crid=265GSAY8OL2YP&amp;keywords=too+big+to+fail+book&amp;qid=1578492969&amp;sprefix=too+big+to+%2Caps%2C195&amp;sr=8-1"">Too Big to Fail</a>. </em></p>
<p>Existing large organizations were protected by government intervention. When they were so damaged that they could not be defended, instead of letting them fail, <em>they were forcibly merged into even larger organizations</em>. </p>
<p>With our much larger productivity and surplus, our greater ability to do finance and run large deficits for long periods, and greater ability to absorb negative shocks, and our growing distaste for risk and loss of any kind, along with a long peace, and our judgment of leaders on extreme short term perception of outcomes, we have biased things greatly against disruption. </p>
<p>That then combines with the effects of regulatory capture and crony capitalism. The rise of mazes and maze behaviors is a vicious cycle. </p>
<p>We’ve also seen a dearth of <i>positive </i>shocks. Technological breakthroughs, economic developments and other big positive events allow new entrants to gain advantage over existing entrenched interests whose cached actions are increasingly inefficient and no longer make sense.</p>
<p>It is unknown to what extent this dearth of positive shocks is due to inherent difficulty in pushing forward at the current technological frontier, to what extent it is a cost of choices we have made, and to what extent <em>it was the intent </em>of the choices that were made.</p>
<p>In many cases, here and now, progress and disruption that would challenge existing systems is being forcibly suppressed. Some of the mechanisms of this will be among this list of causes, again with a mix between inherent, unintentional and intentional. Incumbents of all kinds by default are fragile and would prefer the status quo not be disrupted. Being mazes only enhances these incentives. In other cases, we’ve run into some combination of increasing difficulty of underlying problems, and our increasing lack of ability to do things even when not inhibited. </p>
<p><b>Cause 4: Increased Demand for Illusion of Safety and Security</b></p>
<p>Safety and security are important. They are not infinitely important. They are <em>extremely </em>poor choices for sacred values.  </p>
<p>Illusion of safety and illusion of security are increasingly seen as important sacred values. Occasionally so are actual safety and security. </p>
<p>In important ways, we are less secure than in the past. </p>
<p>Due to cultural changes, atomization and government interventions, we cannot count on our family, our friends or our community to support us. Even when we <i>can </i>count on them to support us, what we are counting on is a different order of magnitude of support from far fewer people. Government safety nets, even at their best, are a poor replacement.</p>
<p>We are taught that fulfilling all the requirements to responsibly have children and a family requires many stars to simultaneously align. We are put on very tight deadlines. There is huge risk that these things will not happen for us at all. They are the things that many people value the most today, and which most people valued most in the past. One is not permitted to ‘skip ahead’ as one is often kept in educational limbo and then a post-education period where you are not expected to be able to seriously attempt a family, until the clock has almost run out, then the scramble begins.</p>
<p>We also in important ways have longer memories and less ability to recover from mistakes or poor trajectories. The very idea of things going on one’s ‘permanent record’ puts one in continuous danger even as a young child. Path dependence goes up. We have this concept that one’s ‘life can be over’ as the result of quite minor misfortunes. Potentially this can be as small as an ill-advised tweet, or a poorly navigated social interaction.</p>
<p>Then we are expected to end this journey with millions of dollars in ‘life savings’ as a substitute for the old support systems. That money can still be expropriated at any time by the medical or elder care systems. </p>
<p>Rates of depression, suicide, traumatic stress and other mental health issues have skyrocketed, likely largely as a result of all of these other dangers and pressures, also largely because we are taught to find lesser and lesser issues unacceptable and crippling. Increasing numbers of people generally feel unprepared for problems that would not have much fazed them in the past, or in some cases would not have even qualified as problems. We can’t even.</p>
<p>In important ways, we are <i>more physically safe</i> than in the past. </p>
<p>Our trauma care and treatment of infections has dramatically improved. The rates of physical trauma, street crime and infection have gone down and the consequences tend to be less severe. Murder rates are down. Cars are vastly safer than in the past. Planes are much less risky than the car ride to the airport. Whenever I hear about accidents from travel these days, it’s <em>almost universally</em> in fiction, or what would have in the past been a minor accident that now makes the news. Our food supply is vastly safer. Our toys and playgrounds are vastly safer. </p>
<p>Our physical products and physical spaces and lives are universally are vastly safer. </p>
<p>Life <i>really shouldn’t </i>feel physically scary the same way that it used to.  The rising physical risks are suicide and drug abuse, which are a different kind of physical risk, and <em>the consequences of too much safety </em>such as allergies.  </p>
<p>In important ways, we are also <i>more emotionally safe </i>than in the past, as well. In other important ways, we are far <i>more emotionally at risk</i>. </p>
<p>We are safer in the sense that things that many unpleasant things that were considered normal parts of life are now considered unacceptable, and thus we guard against them. We still must deal with violence, with racism, with sexism, with abuse, with religious intolerance, with homophobia and transphobia, and hosts of other similar problems. Insert all additional concerns here. But without in any way saying that any of our current concerns are illegitimate, <em>oh my </em>are all those problems in a vastly better place than they used to be. As Jim Norton commented in his most recent stand-up special, many of the stories our grandparents tell of how they met would, by modern ears, horrify us. </p>
<p>Such questions are treated as much more of a priority than they used to be, especially in educational settings. We also make aggressive use of psychiatric medication. </p>
<p>We are less safe from such things in two ways. </p>
<p>We are less safe in the sense that we no longer are taught that such things are acceptable, or that we should be able to ‘walk it off’ when they happen or take it on the chin. Nor are we forced to practice dealing with them. Thus have a much harder time dealing with them when they happen. We have the problems that come with a revolution of rising expectations.</p>
<p>We are also less safe in the sense that mazes turn everything into a signal and tool in the maze’s political games. Even when one could shrug off an event and its direct consequences, that event also comprises a move within the game. If people observe that offense can be done to you without retaliation, that is a license to everyone to ramp up the level of offense. This transforms your social identity into one to whom offense can safely be done, thus destroying your status and any hopes for success, including assistance with high placement into another maze. </p>
<p>A lot of this safety comes at the direct expense of fun, learning and efficiency. And a lot of it makes us so safe that people are failing to encounter the adversity they need to become resilient. </p>
<p>This all seems quite bad to me on its own merits, but one could disagree. It largely reflects the <em>very good news </em>that life is safer and thus we are free to demand it be safer still. This being a cause of increased maze activity doesn’t depend on it being otherwise good or bad.  </p>
<p>This rise in risk of failure tracks the physical and social risks of ‘falling off the track’ described above. Emotionally falling off the track has also become far more dangerous. </p>
<p>The risk of things going wrong has gone down at many steps. So has our tolerance for those things going wrong, and our tolerance for risk of things going wrong. We have gone from resilient to fragile. Meanwhile, we’ve lost traditional supports, and many circumstances and life transitions have become far more perilous than they have ever been.</p>
<p>This has bled into even tiny decisions, such as what to have for lunch in a strange town.</p>
<p>One of the highest value practical lessons of rationality is to recognize what is actually safe and unsafe and to what degree, and when it makes sense to take an unconventional path.</p>
<h4><strong>How do these phenomena raise maze levels?</strong></h4>
<p>Mazes are, among other things, engines for producing the illusion of safety and the illusion of security. In some ways and cases, they do this by producing the real thing. In other cases, it is pure illusion. Either way, they have a huge comparative advantage. </p>
<p>Working for large organizations is seen as safe and secure. So is working as part of a profession whose rents are protected by regulation and other barriers to entry. Working elsewhere is seen as risky and insecure. </p>
<p>A product made by a maze is seen as reliable and consistent, even if low quality or a bad value.</p>
<p>Existing risks are ‘grandfathered in.’ Once an activity, product, drug or what have you is approved and becomes standard, that becomes subject to a different frame, where taking that risk isn’t considered risk, and it doesn’t open you up to being blamed if something goes wrong. If no one gets fired for buying IBM, as the saying goes, it’s going to take a damn good reason to buy something else. </p>
<p>Inside a maze, that is a huge support for doing business with and helping other mazes over other non-mazes. Outside a maze, people are still largely seeking to avoid being blamed and/or blameworthy.</p>
<p>When your options are bad, it is even more important to show that you have made the conventional, standard and therefore ‘safe’ choice, so that when it blows up in your face, it is not your fault. For a current real example in my own life, I will be using a health insurance broker to navigate the dystopian wasteland that is the individual health insurance market in New York, and placing a high priority on a policy that provides illusion of security.</p>
<p>Even if all is well and safe and good, and that is not in dispute, when something is new, or isn’t the generic standard thing, the default consumer does not know this. Why go to the trouble of finding out, <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2019/04/25/asymmetric-justice/"">when anything that goes wrong is then your fault</a>, <i>even if it had nothing to do with your choice, or your choice actively made it less likely</i>? </p>
<p>New risks, and any downside of a new proposal to basically anyone, are taken vastly out of proportion. Mazes are much better equipped to handle this than non-mazes, as this forces one to play the system and the games of propaganda and public relations, hiding what needs to be hidden, and spending huge amounts of time, money and expertise on the right to do anything. Many of the costs involved are fixed. Small scale efforts often don’t survive this. </p>
<p>Safety regulations and other requirements for doing things are almost always conceptualized based on what currently exists. Lobbyists made sure that existing systems could handle them, and protested loudly if that would be expensive. If you’re thinking of a new way of doing things, even if it makes the existing system look vastly unsafe in some way, it is likely to violate one of the existing technical requirements, or make some aspect slightly less safe in some fashion. </p>
<p>Real shame, that. </p>
<p>I leave as an open question <i>how often the purpose of the safety regulations is the prevention of innovation and competition.</i></p>
<p><b>Cause 5: Rent Seeking is More Widespread and Seen as Legitimate</b></p>
<p>This is a result as well as a cause.</p>
<p>Mazes have comparative advantage at seeking, securing and extracting rents. Rents are what keep the mazes running once they are no longer capable of efficient creation of value.</p>
<p>Thus, part of their reversal of morality is to turn the destructive act of rent seeking into the legitimate and respectable thing that one does to earn a living, and make positive-sum actions seem increasingly illegitimate.  </p>
<p>That major forces in our society are pushing this, and that it has been working, have been addressed earlier in the series. To the extent that they haven’t been, it’s another post or even sequence, and I won’t argue further for it here. </p>
<p><b>Cause 6: Big Data, Machine Learning and Internet Economics</b></p>
<p>Big data and machine learning swing the balance in favor of mazes. </p>
<p>Mazes are full of people who could not communicate with each other (extreme case of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNAFU_Principle"">the SNAFU principle</a>), who are many steps removed from the object-level considerations they neither understand nor have the data or skill to process, and make decisions based on metrics and political considerations largely around those metrics. And not caring about incidental effects.  </p>
<p>Machine learning gives a powerful tool to anyone with a metric to optimize and lots of data that can be gathered. The explicit price of this is giving up on a gears-level understanding of what is going on or how things work, not caring too much about incidental effects, and trusting the algorithm. Thus, machine learning helps mazes be much better at what they wanted to do anyway, while charging them prices they’ve already paid.</p>
<p>Others are then judged by those mazes and metrics and pushed towards using more machine learning style strategies. If they give in to this, outsiders lose their advantages of actually understanding how things work and what is important and seeing incidental effects, and are at a severe data disadvantage because the only data that counts is no longer the type of data they have. </p>
<p>Mazes also benefit because big data and machine learning love huge amounts of data. Huge amounts of data demand scale. Instead of having humans in charge of decisions, now algorithms are in charge of those decisions. The blindness of those inside the maze becomes a blindness from lack of data for those who don’t have sufficient scale.</p>
<p>Internet economics is then shaped by this machine learning and by optimizing for metrics, especially when bidding for advertising and trying to reach the point where one can use advertising to scale. A lot of costs are fixed, which favors large over small. Other aspects do favor small over large, and favor better over worse. So it’s not a complete loss. And there’s a lot of pushback. </p>
<p>I am not claiming this is one directional or simple. </p>
<p>In addition to the issue of what algorithms do to mazes that use them, there is the issue of what algorithms do to the people the algorithms are reacting to, when they want to change and/or are shaped by how the algorithms react. When algorithms are optimizing how to react to us, we face similar underappreciated pressures even if we are not using them, which also contributes to all this. Our entire mode of thinking about the world becomes warped. That’s a much bigger topic beyond scope.</p>
<h4><strong>Cause 7: Ignorance</strong></h4>
<p>Mazes are an example of a thing that, unless they have already sufficiently corrupted values in general, could be destroyed by the truth. </p>
<p>Mazes depend upon the public, and in particular on potential workers and associates, not understanding how mazes work or what working in or with a maze will do to their lives and souls. People do understand that there is something soul-crushing about ‘working for the man’ and that is true as well, but mostly misses the point. </p>
<p>It takes a minimum of years inside a maze to start to understand how mazes work from the inside, or how bad it gets in middle management, if no one explicitly tells you. By that time, many are too invested to stop, or have already self-modified in ways that leave them no longer able to perceive the problem. Even if you have the data needed to put it together, my experience is that to fully appreciate what you are dealing with, <em>you have to quit first. </em>Which would mean you need to quit before you realize how badly you need to quit. Whoops.</p>
<p>If someone does explicitly tell you beforehand, you’re inclined not to believe it, because such warnings usually lack the gears and sound absurd, and come from people who appear biased against business or are experiencing sour grapes. Because things would sound so absurd, those doing the warning will round down their warnings to sound reasonable. Then the listener does the same. Even when the source is credible and provides gears, as I hope this source does when combined with the original book, the brain constantly instinctively rounds it all down to avoid seeing the thing. Those who recoil in horror at the thought of working for a maze, who are not doing so based on hard won experience, <i>usually don’t know the half of it.</i></p>
<p>This is enough to ensure that workers at large corporations <i>make more money </i>than those at smaller ones. Tyler Cowen and other defenders of large corporations use this as evidence that large corporations make people more productive. I think this represents a terribly incomplete model of how labor markets work. Workers are not primarily paid in some relation to their marginal product. The accounting identity neither holds nor does it enlighten much.</p>
<p>My model is more along the lines of: Workers are paid in relation to what it costs to attract talent to a position, and then the business either is or is not viable. One of the inputs to that is indeed the worker’s perception of their marginal or average production at that job. There is some expectation that great success will be shared with the workers to some extent. Not to do so would make them upset. This is mostly a threshold effect and acts largely on marginal compensation via reciprocity and fairness. This isn’t centrally about supply and demand curves meeting. In good times one gets a raise. </p>
<p>The exception is when there is a strong union. A strong union changes the calculation from what workers will accept to work here instead of elsewhere, to a zero-sum battle by the union to extract maximal resources from the corporation without too quickly driving it into bankruptcy, versus the corporation trying to retain profits and not let them do that. This conflict plays out in a legal structure where many otherwise legal things become illegal, other otherwise illegal things become legal or mandatory, and the outcomes are weird. Union jobs really are different. </p>
<p>Another input is the status that goes along with a job, and what it feels like it ‘should’ pay on that basis. In most cases this runs in the perverse direction – a ‘better’ job requires <i>more </i>compensation to keep people happy about their pay. Workers have the instinctual sense that higher status jobs should strictly dominate low status ones. They also have the (usually correct) instinctual sense that if the job does not pay, the promised status is fake slash won’t be accepted. And that if lower status jobs are not paid less, or equal status people who produce better are paid more, then their status is under threat, so they will revolt against such practices. Thus, everyone wants the higher status jobs. You cannot effectively balance this with pay.</p>
<p>It really is a terribly bad idea to let the workers find out what the other workers are paid.</p>
<p>A lot of this, one hopes, is based on how much someone wants to do that job, and have the life that goes along with having that job.</p>
<p>When we see that jobs in big corporations pay more, rather than conclude they must be more productive, I primarily take this as evidence of some combination of two things. </p>
<p>One, that <i>working at a big corporation is something people dislike, so you have to pay them more to do it. </i>This despite them not knowing how much they should dislike it, and therefore demand in compensation, and despite a lot of career lock-in. We also see above-standard pay in large government bureaucracies. </p>
<p>That can be combine with two, that <em>working at a big corporation is seen as higher status, and therefore demands higher pay. </em></p>
<p>We often see poor pay in academia, because people enter thinking they’ll get to think about things all day that they find interesting, and have that position securely for life, they like that lifestyle, and that makes them want the job more. They can then accept lower pay because they (incorrectly) see what they are doing as not being part of a profitable operation, and (correctly) see others think this, so they do not need higher pay to hold onto the job’s high status. </p>
<p>Prospective academics are almost always, as far as I can tell, at least in willful denial about their job prospects, and about how their jobs will work if they find them. They certainly don’t process the news about the incentives and pressures they will face, and the petty battles and tasks that lie ahead.</p>
<p>Big business still has to write those larger checks every two weeks while staying in business. Isn’t that evidence of higher productivity? It’s some evidence of otherwise higher <i>profitability </i>of the corporation, that this does not drive them out of business. Profitability is not productivity. If we think those higher profits are largely due to extractive practices, rents and regulatory advantages rather than production, that does not count. If we think that it is due to things inherent to the corporation, such as intellectual property or monopoly or returns to scale, and this in turn causes employees to demand more compensation, that also does not count if it’s not the employees (or not all but a handful of employees) doing the production. </p>
<p>If people knew the truth about working for mazes and especially being in middle management, and/or were facing less outside pressure, they would demand much higher pay. This would make mazes bear more of the real costs they impose on people, while making it harder to attract strong talent. It would be much easier to justify declining such jobs, and harder to push someone into accepting one. Doing other things would get relatively higher status. </p>
<p>This would all make mazes less competitive.</p>
<p>So would general knowledge of how mazes derive their advantages and rents from regulation and subsidy. Regulatory capture is rife. Much of what opponents of business and other long entrenched mazes do ends up being used by those entrenched mazes to cement their advantages. A common pattern is outrage at the actions of corrupt actors, creating demand for new rules and regulations, which turn out primarily to entrench and enrich those same corrupt actors.</p>
<p>If people understood these dynamics, and knew what mazes were, they would use different tools. They would demand different interventions. Then there are the things that business convinces the government to do directly. If those were better understood, and people could coordinate to stop them, that would be an even bigger boon.  </p>
<p>One could object that this isn’t a difference with past conditions. Did people in the past know these things? </p>
<p>Ignorance often comes form not knowing the alternatives to the maze way of doing things, or that there exist or ever have existed things other than mazes, or of the ways in which mazes take over non-mazes and how to prevent that. People object that things are terrible, and they respond that since the incentives naturally trend towards these terrible things, how could things ever not be terrible? Despite things sometimes not being terrible, and things not being terrible in general. Those in charge of non-maze spaces invite the maze-runners in willingly, without knowing they have sealed the space’s fate.</p>
<p>This was not true in the sufficiently distant past. It is not even true for <em>your </em>sufficiently distant past. It is <em>learned behavior. </em>We do not begin life this way. Children begin only knowing the non-maze way of doing things. Then we send them to school. Then we give them jobs.</p>
<p>The hypothesis here is that things were different in the past because people were regularly exposed to non-mazes as central actors in their worlds. This taught them that small maze levels were the normal way of being, instead of being mostly exposed to mazes as central actors, building their lives around them, and being taught that this was the normal way of being. People used to realize that the things involved in this were <i>weird </i>and now they aren’t weird anymore. This leaves us blind to what mazes result in. People used to expect better.</p>
<p>Ignorance often also takes the form of <i>not knowing how to do actual business. </i>Most people today have no idea how to go about working on their own, feeling mostly that There Be Dragons. Or generally how they or their worlds might survive without giant engines taking care of things for them on all levels. That did not used to be the case.</p>
<h4><strong>Cause 8: Atomization and the Delegitimization of Human Social Needs</strong></h4>
<p>A large cost of working in mazes is that they do not permit full independent outside social lives. People are told to isolate themselves and neglect basic human needs. Our society’s willingness to treat such a condition as normal, acceptable and appropriate means that they can pull this off. </p>
<p>In the past, in most times and places, I believe that people would have realized how terrible all of this increasingly has been and prioritized fixing it. This would have made people realize that joining an all-consuming maze was a huge life cost not to be taken lightly, rather than a source of palliatives to help one suffer through an impoverished social life.</p>
<p>For those in middle management or above, they are being evaluated on everything they do. This includes who they choose to associate with, including who they marry and how they raise their kids, how they spend their time outside of work, what church if any they go to, and so forth. They are also under increasing pressure to spend every possible waking moment on job-related things. Socializing with coworkers mostly counts.</p>
<p>Even for those not in middle management, jobs play havoc with their schedules and flexibility. Almost total reliability is demanded at most jobs in large organizations during standard hours, and most require also working outside of those hours when asked to do so. Any exceptions are quite costly. Vacation time is both slim and usually planned well in advance. This is hard on someone trying to live life, especially with a family. You end up tired all the time. Your life becomes a grind. Any free time largely needs to be spent recovering. </p>
<p>The majority of your waking hours are spent interacting with your coworkers, who you mostly did not choose. They then effectively become your friends, and often even your family, the same way they do in most workplace television shows. They are the people who have things in common with you, who you can reasonably keep up with and make plans with. Often they are the people you date, despite all attempts at policy to the contrary, and whether or not there are bad dynamics involved.</p>
<p>On a broader scale, you do not only keep the hours they tell you to keep. You live where they tell you to live, so you can work where they tell you to work. In the ongoing battle to create a rationalist community in New York, there is the constant assumption by everyone that finding a good job somewhere determines where you live. One of my three closest remaining friends, a former Magic: The Gathering professional, recently uprooted his family, including three kids, and sold his apartment, because job offers in another city were somewhat better than those here. His entire family knows zero people in the new city. That is now simply what one does. People who have skills or ambition are <i>expected </i>to walk away from everyone they have ever known for a job. </p>
<p>This happens because basic human social needs have been delegitimized. Work provides one with one’s ‘social life’ and ‘friends’ and even ‘family,’ and we are expected to count that as a benefit. I believe that in most times and places, this would rightfully be seen as a deeply impoverished bastardization of these concepts. People think their Facebook ‘friends’ are friends, or even close friends. They’re not.</p>
<p>Atomization has many other causes as well. I have wide uncertainty how much higher maze levels <em>caused </em>atomization, as opposed to atomization causing higher maze levels. The deligitimization of basic human needs seems more tied to maze issues. </p>
<p>Given all that, how does one invest in real and deep long term friendships and groups, when they are increasingly unlikely to last? </p>
<p>If you have a better answer than ‘persevere and hope for the best’ <em>please </em>share. I give great thanks for the few old friends that are still around.</p>
<h4>Cause 9: Educational System</h4>
<p>We indoctrinate our citizens to the horrors of mazes early and often.</p>
<p>Our first step is to imprison our children, starting from around the age of five, for the bulk of their waking hours. During that time, all of their behaviors are tightly controlled, and they are taught that their success in life depends on satisfying the arbitrary demands of the person put in charge of them, who will mostly use negative selection to determine outcomes. When asked to justify doing this, the reply is typically that if you do not do this to your child now, your child will be ill-prepared to be subjected to increasingly intense versions of it as they progress through the educational system.</p>
<p>You had better suffer and kill your soul now, or else you won’t be prepared to suffer worse things later.</p>
<p>Once taught that life is about obeying arbitrary dictates and doing work with no object level application whatsoever, giving most of your life over to arbitrary schedules and demands, and gathering together credentials and approvals necessary to get the labels that get others to give you status and compensation, where everyone is on the lookout for reasons to put black marks on your record, you are ready to work in a maze without recoiling in horror.</p>
<p>This process also saddles its students with massive debts that force them to then take jobs they hate, and gives them credentials that give them an advantage in narrow rent extraction in one area, preventing choice or exit.</p>
<p>I previously wrote at somewhat more length on this in these posts: <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2018/04/15/the-case-against-education/"">The Case Against Education</a>, <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2018/04/21/the-case-against-education-foundations/"">The Case Against Education: Foundations</a>, <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2018/04/29/the-case-against-education-splitting-the-education-premium-pie-and-considering-iq/"">The Case Against Education: Splitting the Education Premium Pie and Considering IQ</a>, <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/08/05/something-was-wrong/"">Something Was Wrong</a></p>
<p><b>Cause 10: Vicious Cycle</b></p>
<p>Mazes are self-reinforcing. </p>
<p>Many of these causes make this clear. Mazes cause a problem and shift in priorities and values, which in turn makes mazes more attractive and devalues non-mazes. It makes people rely more and more on mazes for their needs. More mazes gives maze activities more interactions with other maze activities and those caught in mazes, legitimizes maze activities and delegitimizes non-maze activities, causing a vicious cycle.</p>
<p>Once people are sufficiently dependent on mazes, or mazes gain sufficient influence and power, there is a critical phase shift. Morality’s sign flips. The forces of social approval, which previously were pushing against maze behaviors, instead start pushing for them. People punish others for not orienting towards mazes and away from the object-level, where before they did the opposite and some people chose mazes in spite of this.</p>
<p>That phase shift seems to have happened in the bulk of general society, including our school system and our political system, and increasingly in social life lived via social media, causing an accelerating problem.</p>
<p>Reputational systems in general have largely become maze-oriented reputation systems. School is about ‘what looks good on an application.’ Work is about ‘what looks good on a resume’ when it isn’t about the boss. Romantic life is even based largely on ‘what looks good on a dating profile’ or in the first moments of interaction, favoring the legible over the illegible more than previous systems. </p>
<p>The more one must likely deal with mazes in the future, and the more they determine our futures, the more ‘guard one’s reputation’ means ‘make sure the searchable record does not contain things mazes will dislike, and let one tell to mazes the story one wants to tell.’ </p>
<p>These new concerns crowd out what one would otherwise be concerned about. One key thing they crowd out is wanting to be known in good ways for who you actually are and what you do, by people who observe you, who will then tell other people. Mazes can and often do start to destroy your connection to object level reality long before you ever set foot in one. </p>
<p>Even when the reputation system is based on explicitly being judged by those who interact with you, such as customer reviews, it’s about an average quantification. This largely becomes another metric game. Such systems do excellent work detecting when things are wrong, but mostly operate via negative selection due to clustering of ratings near the top of the range allowed. Thus they likely will become increasingly distortionary with time towards prioritizing avoiding the things that legibly cause bad ratings, effectively punishing anything non-standard or any attempt to be exceptional, because when you earn that sixth star, you’re not allowed to collect it. </p>
<p>A costly way to go above the non-costly maximum would potentially help, but has its own problems, and further discussion is fascinating to me but beyond the scope here. It is a hard problem.</p>
<h4>More Mazes, More Problems</h4>
<p>Next post I will present the best potential solutions I could come up with. This is not a problem that can be fully solved, but certainly there are changes on the margin that would decrease the rate at which things get worse, or even roll the damage back somewhat.</p>
<p>Implementing them, of course, is a whole additional problem.</p>

<p>The topic of consciousness is quite popular, and confusing, in philosophy. While I do not seek to fully resolve the philosophy of consciousness, I hope to offer an angle on the question I have not seen before. This angle is that of developmental ontology: how are ""later"" ontologies developed from ""earlier"" ontologies? I wrote on developmental ontology in&nbsp;<a href=""https://unstableontology.com/2019/04/13/occamian-conjecturalism-we-posit-reality/"">a previous post</a>, and this post can be thought of as an elaboration, which can be read on its own, and specifically tackles the problem of consciousness.</p>
<p>Much of the discussion of stabilization is heavily inspired by&nbsp;<em><a href=""https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/origin-objects"">On the Origin of Objects</a></em>, an excellent book on reference and ontology, to which I owe much of my ontological development. To the extent that I have made any philosophical innovation, it is in combining this book's concepts with the minimum-description-length principle, and analytic philosophy of mind.</p>
<h2>World-perception ontology</h2>
<p>I'm going to write a sequence of statements, which each make sense in terms of an intuitive world-perception ontology.</p>
<ul>
<li>There's a real world outside of my head.</li>
<li>I exist and am intimately connected with, if not identical with, some body in this world.</li>
<li>I only see some of the world. What I can see is like what a camera placed at the point my eyes are can see.</li>
<li>The world contains objects. These objects have properties like shape, color, etc.</li>
<li>When I walk, it is me who moves, not everything around me. Most objects are not moving most of the time, even if they look like they're moving in my visual field.</li>
<li>Objects, including my body, change and develop over time. Changes proceed, for the most part, in a continuous way, so e.g. object shapes and sizes rarely change, and teleportation doesn't happen.</li>
</ul>
<p>These all seem common-sensical; it would be strange to doubt them. However, achieving the ontology by which such statements are common-sensical is nontrivial. There are many moving parts here, which must be working in their places before the world seems as sensible as it is.</p>
<p>Let's look at the ""it is me who moves, not everything around me"" point, because it's critical. If you try shaking your head right now, you will notice that your visual field changes rapidly. An object (such as a computer screen) in your vision is going to move side-to-side (or top-to-bottom), from one side of your visual field to another.</p>
<p>However, despite this, there is an intuitive sense of the object&nbsp;<em>not</em> moving. So, there is a stabilization process involved.&nbsp;<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_stabilization"">Image stabilization</a>&nbsp;(example&nbsp;<a href=""https://gfycat.com/criminalaromaticesok-imagestabilization-nostupidquestions"">here</a>) is an excellent analogy for this process (indeed, the brain could be said to engage in image stabilization in a literal sense).</p>
<p>The world-perception ontology is, much of the time, geocentric, rather than egocentric or heliocentric. If you walk, it usually seems like the ground is still and you are moving, rather than the ground moving while you're still (egocentrism), or both you and the ground moving very quickly (heliocentrism). There are other cases such as vehicle interiors where what is stabilized is not the Earth, but the vehicle itself; and, ""tearing"" between this reference frame and the geocentric reference frame can cause motion sickness.</p>
<p>Notably, world-perception ontology must contain both (a) a material world and (b) ""my perceptions of it"". Hence, the intuitive ontological split between material and consciousness. To take such a split to be metaphysically basic is to be a Descartes-like dualist. And the split is ontologically compelling enough that such a metaphysics can be tempting.</p>
<h2>Pattern-only ontology</h2>
<p>William James famously described the baby's sense of the world as a ""blooming, buzzing confusion"". The image presented is one of dynamism and instability, very different from world-perception ontology.</p>
<p>The baby's ontology is closer to raw percepts than an adult's is; it's less developed, fewer things are stabilized, and so on. Babies generally haven't learned&nbsp;<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_permanence"">object permanence</a>; this is a stabilization that is only developed later.</p>
<p>The most basic ontology consists of raw percepts (which cannot even be considered ""percepts"" from within this ontology), not even including shapes; these percepts may be analogous to pixel-maps in the case of vision, or spectrograms in the case of hearing, but I am unsure of these low-level details, and the rest of this post would still apply if the basic percepts were e.g. lines in vision. Shapes (which are higher-level percepts) must be recognized in the sea of percepts, in a kind of unsupervised learning.</p>
<p>The process of stabilization is intimately related to a process of pattern-detection. If you can detect patterns of shapes across time, you may reify such patterns as an&nbsp;<em>object</em>. (For example, a blue circle that is present in the visual field, and retains the same shape even as it moves around the field, or exits and re-enters, may be reified as a circular object). Such pattern-reification is analogous to folding a symmetric image in half: it allows the full image to be described using less information than was contained in the original image.</p>
<p>In general, the&nbsp;<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_description_length"">minimum description length principle</a>&nbsp;says it is epistemically correct to posit fewer objects to explain many. And, positing a small number of shapes to explain many basic percepts, or a small number of objects to explain a large number of shapes, are examples of this.</p>
<p>From having read some texts on meditation (especially&nbsp;<a href=""https://smile.amazon.com/Mastering-Core-Teachings-Buddha-Unusually/dp/1904658407?sa-no-redirect=1"">Mastering the Core Teachings of the Buddha</a>), and having meditated myself, I believe that meditation can result in getting more in-touch with pattern-only ontology, and that this is an intended result, as the pattern-only ontology necessarily contains two of the&nbsp;<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_marks_of_existence"">three characteristics</a>&nbsp;(specifically, impermanence and no-self).</p>
<p>To summarize: babies start from a confusing point, where there are low-level percepts, and patterns progressively recognized in them, which develops ontology including shapes and objects.</p>
<h2>World-perception ontology results from stabilization</h2>
<p>The thesis of this post may now be stated:&nbsp;<em>world-perception ontology results from stabilizing a previous ontology that is itself closer to pattern-only ontology</em>.</p>
<p>One of the most famous examples of stabilization in science is the movement from geocentrism to heliocentrism. Such stabilization explains many epicycles in terms of few cycles, by&nbsp;<em>changing where the center is</em>.</p>
<p>The move from egocentrism to geocentrism is quite analogous. An egocentric reference frame will contain many ""epicycles"", which can be explained using fewer ""cycles"" in geocentrism.</p>
<p>These cycles are literal in the case of a person spinning around in a circle. In a pattern-only ontology (which is, necessarily, egocentric, for the same reason it doesn't have a concept of self), that person will see around them shapes moving rapidly in the same direction. There are many motions to explain here. In a world-percept ontology, most objects around are not moving rapidly; rather, it is believed that the self is spinning.</p>
<p>So, the egocentric-to-geocentric shift is compelling for the same reason the geocentric-to-heliocentric shift is. It allows one to posit that there are few motions, instead of many motions. This makes percepts easier to explain.</p>
<h2>Consciousness in world-perception ontology</h2>
<p>The upshot of what has been said so far is: the world-perception ontology results from Occamian symmetry-detection and stabilization starting from a pattern-only ontology (or, some intermediate ontology).</p>
<p>And, the world-perception ontology has conscious experience as a component. For, how else can what were originally perceptual patterns be explained, except by positing that there is a camera-like entity in the world (attached to some physical body) that generates such percepts?</p>
<p>The idea that consciousness doesn't exist (which is asserted by some forms of&nbsp;<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliminative_materialism"">eliminative materialism</a>) doesn't sit well with this picture. The ontological development that produced the idea of the material world, also produced the idea of consciousness, as a dual. And both parts are necessary to make sense of percepts. So, consciousness-eliminativism will continue to be unintuitive (and for good epistemic reasons!) until it can replace world-perception ontology with one that achieves percept-explanation that is at least as effective. And that looks to be difficult or impossible.</p>
<p>To conclude: the ontology that allows one to conceptualize the material world as existing and not shifting constantly, includes as part of it conscious perception, and&nbsp;<em>could not function without including it</em>. Without such a component, there would be no way to refactor rapidly shifting perceptual patterns into a stable outer world and a moving point-of-view contained in it.</p>

PjfsbKrK5MnJDDoFr,Have epistemic conditions always been this bad?,have-epistemic-conditions-always-been-this-bad,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/PjfsbKrK5MnJDDoFr/have-epistemic-conditions-always-been-this-bad,2020-01-25T04:42:52.190Z,211,96,106,False,True,,"<html><head></head><body><p>In the last few months, I've gotten increasingly alarmed by leftist politics in the US, and the epistemic conditions that it operates under and is imposing wherever it gains power. (Quite possibly the conditions are just as dire on the right, but they are not as visible or salient to me, because most of the places I can easily see, either directly or through news stories, i.e., local politics in my area, academia, journalism, large corporations, seem to have been taken over by the left.)</p>
<p>I'm worried that my alarmism is itself based on confirmation bias, tribalism, catastrophizing, or any number of other biases. (It confuses me that I seem to be the first person to talk much about this on either LW or EA Forum, given that there must be people who have been exposed to the current political environment earlier or to a greater extent than me. On the other hand, all my posts/comments on the subject have generally been upvoted on both forums, and nobody has specifically said that I'm being too alarmist. One possible explanation for nobody else raising an alarm about this is that they're afraid of the current political climate and they're not as ""cancel-proof"" as I am, or don't feel that they have as much leeway to talk about politics-adjacent issues here as I do.)</p>
<p>So I want to ask, have things always been like this, or have they actually gotten significantly worse in recent (say the last 5 or 10) years? If they've always been like this, then perhaps there is less cause for alarm, because (1) if things have always been this bad, and we muddled through them in the past, we can probably continue to muddle through in the future (modulo new x-risks like AGI), and (2) if there is no recent trend towards worsening conditions then we don't need to worry so much about conditions getting worse in the near future. (Obviously if we go back far enough, say to the Middle Ages, then things were almost certainly as bad or worse, but I'm worried about more recent trends.)</p>
<p>If there are other reasons to not be very alarmed aside from the past being just as bad, please feel free to talk about those as well. But in case one of those reasons is ""why be alarmed when there's little that can be done about it"", my answer is that being alarmed motivates one to try to understand what is going on, which can help with (1) deciding personal behavior now in expectation of future changes (for example if there's going to be a literal Cultural Revolution in the future, then I need to be really really careful what I say today), (2) planning x-risk strategy, and (3) defending LW/EA from either outside attack or similar internal dynamics.</p>
<p>Here's some of what I've observed so far, which has led me to my current epistemic state:</p>
<p>In local politics, ""asking for evidence of oppression is a form of oppression"" or even more directly ""questioning the experiences of a marginalized group that you don't belong to is not allowed and will result in a ban"" has apparently been an implicit norm, and is being made increasingly explicit. (E.g., I saw a FB group explicitly codifying this in their rules.) As a result, anyone can say ""Policy X or Program Y oppresses Group Z and must be changed"" and nobody can argue against that, except by making the same kind of claim based on a different identity group, and then it comes down to which group is recognized as being more privileged or oppressed by the current orthodoxy. (If someone <em>does</em> belong to Group Z and wants to argue against the claim on that basis, they'll be dismissed based on ""being tokenized"" or ""internalized oppression"".)</p>
<p>In academia, even leftist professors are being silenced or kicked out on a regular basis for speaking out against an ever-shifting ""party line"". (""Party line"" is in quotes because it is apparently not determined in a top-down fashion by people in charge of a political party, but instead seems to arise from the bottom up, which is even scarier as no one can decide to turn this off, like the Chinese Communist Party did to end the Cultural Revolution after Mao died.) See <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/pFAavCTW56iTsYkvR/ai-alignment-open-thread-october-2019?commentId=Pbpb4JNszz3o22vv9"">here</a> for a previous comment on this with links. I don't recall reading this kind of stories before about 5 years ago.</p>
<p>The thing that most directly prompted me to write this post was this (the most ""recommended"") comment on a <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/31/style/cancel-culture.html#commentsContainer"">recent New York Times story about ""cancel culture""</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Having just graduated from the University of Minnesota last year, a very liberal college, I believe these examples don't adequately show how far cancel culture has gone and what it truly is. The examples used of disassociating from obvious homophobes, or more classic bullying that teenage girls have always done to each other since the dawn of time is not new and not really cancel culture. The cancel culture that is truly new to my generation is the full blocking or shutting out of someone who simply has a different opinion than you. My experience in college was it morphed into a culture of fear for most. The fear of cancellation or punishment for voicing an opinion that the ""group"" disagreed with created a culture where most of us sat silent. My campus was not one of fruitful debate, but silent adherence to whatever the most ""woke"" person in the classroom decided was the correct thing to believe or think. This is not how things worked in the past, people used to be able to disagree, debate and sometimes feel offended because we are all looking to get closer to the truth on whatever topic it may be. Our problem with cancel culture is it snuffs out any debate, there is no longer room for dissent or nuance, the group can decide that your opinion isn't worth hearing and - poof you've been canceled into oblivion. Whatever it's worth I'd like to note I'm a liberal, voted for Obama and Hillary, those who participate in cancel culture aren't liberals to me, they've hijacked the name.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I went to the University of Washington (currently also quite liberal, see one of the above linked ""professor"" stories which took place at UW) in the late 90s, and I don't remember things being like this back then, but some of the replies to this comment say that things <em>were</em> this bad before:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>@Cal thoughtful comment, however, i grew up in the late 60s-70s and what you described was going on then also.  the technology of course is different today, and the issues different.  we never had a name (""cancel"") for it, but it existed.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This sounds a lot like my college experience in the late 80s and early 90s. I think when people get out into the “real world” and have to work with people of varying ages and from varying backgrounds, they realize they need to be more tolerant to get by in the workplace. I remember being afraid to voice any opinion in liberal arts classes, for fear it would be the wrong one and inadvertently offend someone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So LW, what to make of all this?</p>

zdv2W3GR7Po64exDN,Cambridge Prediction Game,cambridge-prediction-game,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/zdv2W3GR7Po64exDN/cambridge-prediction-game,2020-01-25T03:57:59.721Z,13,6,3,False,False,,"<html><head></head><body><p>In order to improve our prediction and calibration skills, the Cambridge, MA rationalist community has been community has been running a prediction game (and keeping score) at a succession of rationalist group houses since 2013.</p>
<p>Below are the rules:</p>
<h3>General</h3>
<p>The game consists of a series of prediction markets. Each market consists of a question that will (within a reasonable timeframe) have a well-defined binary or multiple-choice answer, an initial probability estimate (called the ""house bet""), and a sequence of players' probability estimates. Each prediction is scored on how much more or less accurate it is than the preceding prediction (we do it this way because the previous player's prediction is evidence, and one of the skills this game is meant to develop is updating properly based on what other people think).</p>
<h3>Creating Markets</h3>
<p>Any player can create a market.  To create a market, a player writes the question to be predicted on a whiteboard or on a <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Post-Sticky-Premium-Sticking-559/dp/B00006IA9F"">giant sticky note</a> on the wall with a house bet.  The house bet should be something generally reasonable, but does not need to be super well-informed (this is abusable in theory but has not been abused in practice).</p>
<h3>Making Predictions</h3>
<p>To make a prediction, a player writes their name and their probability estimate under the most recent prediction (or the house bet if there are no predictions so far).  The restrictions on predictions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The player who set the house bet cannot make the first prediction (otherwise they could essentially award themself points by setting a bad house bet).</li>
<li>No predicted probability can be &lt; 0.01.</li>
<li>A player without a positive score cannot lower any predicted probability by more than a factor of 2 (in order to avoid creating too many easy points from going immediately after an inexperienced player).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Scoring</h3>
<p>When a market is settled (i.e. the correct answer becomes known), each prediction is given points equal to:</p>
<pre><code>100 * log2(
  probability given to the correct answer /
  previous probability given to the correct answer)
</code></pre>
<p>In a binary market where the correct answer is no, each prediction's implied probability of ""no"" is used (e.g. if a player predicted 0.25, that is treated as <code>p(no)=0.75</code>).</p>
<p>This is a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoring_rule#Proper_scoring_rules"">strictly proper scoring rule</a>, meaning that the optimal strategy (strategy with the highest expected points) is to bet one's true beliefs about the question.</p>
<p>The points from each market are tracked in a spreadsheet, along with the date each market settled.  The points from each market decay by a factor of <code>e</code> every 180 days.</p>
<p>The score of each player with a positive score is written on one of our whiteboards and is updated semi-regularly.</p>
<h3>Example Markets</h3>
<p>Example binary outcome market:</p>

They are philosophical crises for that agent (and can in theory sometimes be information hazards). For some less severe human examples, see this recent post on <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/byewoxJiAfwE6zpep/reality-revealing-and-reality-masking-puzzles"">reality masking puzzles</a></u>. In AI, example breakers, stoppers, and distorters are logical contradictions (in some symbolic AIs), inability to generalize from examples, and mesa optimizers, respectively.</p><p>Philosophical breakers, stoppers, and distorters all both pose possible problems and opportunities for building safe and aligned AGI and preventing unaligned AGI from becoming dangerous. The may be encountered or solved by either explicit philosophy, implicitly as part of developing another field (like mathematics or AI), by accident, or by trial and error. An awareness of the idea of philosophical breakers, stoppers, and distorters provides another complementary perspective for solving <u><a href=""https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-2.html"">AGI safety</a></u> and may prompt the generation of new safety strategies and AGI designs (see also, this complementary strategy post on <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/bMmhR4epWEQ6prSZh/safety-regulators-a-tool-for-mitigating-technological-risk"">safety regulators</a></u>).</p><h3>Concept definitions</h3><p>Philosophical breakers:</p><ul><li>Philosophical thoughts and questions that cause an agent to break or otherwise take a lot of damage that are hard to anticipate beforehand for that agent.</li></ul><p>Philosophical stoppers:</p><ul><li>Philosophical thoughts and questions that cause an agent to get stuck in an important way that are hard to anticipate beforehand for that agent.</li></ul><p>Philosophical distorters:</p><ul><li>Philosophical thoughts and questions that cause an agent to choose a random or changed philosophical answer than the one it was using (possibly implicitly) earlier. An example in the field of AGI alignment would be something that causes an aligned AGI to in some sense randomly choose it&#x2019;s utility function to be paperclip maximizing because of an <u><a href=""https://intelligence.org/files/OntologicalCrises.pdf"">ontological crisis</a></u>. </li></ul><h4>Concepts providing context, generalization, and contrast</h4><p>Thought breakers, stoppers, and distorters: </p><ul><li>Generalizations of their philosophical versions that covers thoughts and questions in general, like a thought that would cause an agent to halt, implementing algorithms in buggy ways, deep meditative realizations, self-reprogramming that causes unexpected failures, getting stuck in thought loop... that are hard to anticipate beforehand for that agent. </li></ul><p>System breakers, stoppers, and distorters:</p><ul><li>A further generalization that also includes system environment and architecture problems. For instance, system environments could be full of hackers, noisy, or adversarial examples and the architecture could involve genetic algorithms.</li></ul><p>Threats vs breakers, stoppers, and distorters:</p><ul><li>Generalizations of breakers, stoppers, and distorters to  include those things that are easy to anticipate beforehand for that agent.</li></ul><p>Viewpoints: The agent&#x2019;s viewpoint and an external viewpoint. </p><h3>Application domains</h3><p>The natural places to use these concepts are philosophical inquiry, the philosophical parts of mathematics or physics, and AGI alignment. </p><h3>Concept consequences</h3><p>If there is a philosophical breaker or stopper for an AGI when undergoing self-improvement into a superintelligence, and it isn&#x2019;t a problem for humans or it&#x2019;s one that we&#x2019;ve already passed through, then by not disarming it for that AGI we are leaving a barrier in place for its development (a trivial example of this is general intelligence isn&#x2019;t a problem for humans). This can be thought of as a safety method. Such problems can be either naturally found as consequences of an AGI design or an AGI may be designed to encounter them if it undergoes autonomous self-improvement. </p><p>If there is a philosophical distorter in front of a safe and aligned AGI, we&#x2019;ll need to disarm it either by changing the AGI&#x2019;s code/architecture or making the AGI aware of it in a way such that it can avoid it. We could, for instance, hard code an answer or we could point out some philosophical investigations as things to avoid until it is more sophisticated. </p><p>How capable an agent may become and how fast it reaches that capability will partially depend on the philosophical breakers and stoppers it encounters. If the agent has a better ability to search for and disarm them then it can go further without breaking or stopping.</p><p>How safe and aligned an agent is will partially be a function of the philosophical distorters it encounters (which in turn partially depends on its ability to search for them and disarm them). </p><p>Many philosophical breakers and stoppers are also philosophical distorters. For instance if a system gets stuck in generalizing beyond a point, it may rely on evolution instead. In this case we must think more carefully about disarming philosophical breakers and stoppers. If a safe and aligned AGI encounters a philosophical distorter, it is probably not safe and aligned anymore. But if an unaligned AGI encounters a philosophical stopper or breaker, it may be prevented from going further. In some sense, an AGI cannot ever be fully safe and aligned, if it will, upon autonomous self-improvement, encounter a philosophical distorter. </p><h3>A proposed general AGI safety strategy with respect to philosophical breakers, stoppers, and distorters:</h3><ol><li>First, design and implement a safe and aligned AGI (safe up to residual philosophical distorters). If the AGI isn&#x2019;t safe and aligned, then proceed no further until you have one that is.</li><li>Then, remove philosophical distorters that are not philosophical breakers or stoppers</li><li>Then, remove philosophical distorters that are philosophical breakers or stoppers</li><li>And finally, remove philosophical breakers and stoppers</li></ol>",JustinShovelain,justinshovelain,JustinShovelain,

In the post I try to describe why. I start by describing my current model of human values, how I interpret Stuart&apos;s implicit assumptions to conflict with it, and then talk about my confusion with regard to reconciling the two views.</p><h1>The two-layer/ULM model of human values</h1><p><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/fyGEP4mrpyWEAfyqj/player-vs-character-a-two-level-model-of-ethics"">In Player vs. Character: A Two-Level Model of Ethics</a>, Sarah Constantin describes a model where the mind is divided, in game terms, into a &quot;player&quot; and a &quot;character&quot;. The character is everything that we consciously experience, but our conscious experiences are not our true reasons for acting. As Sarah puts it:</p><blockquote> In many games, such as Magic: The Gathering, Hearthstone, or Dungeons and Dragons, there&#x2019;s a two-phase process. First, the player constructs a&#xA0;<em>deck</em> or&#xA0;<em>character</em> from a very large sample space of possibilities.&#xA0; This is a particular combination of strengths and weaknesses and capabilities for action, which the player thinks can be successful against other decks/characters or at winning in the game universe.&#xA0; The choice of deck or character often determines the strategies that deck or character can use in the second phase, which is actual gameplay.&#xA0; In gameplay, the character (or deck) can only use the affordances that it&#x2019;s been previously set up with.&#xA0; This means that there are two separate places where a player needs to get things right: first, in designing a strong character/deck, and second, in executing the optimal strategies for that character/deck during gameplay.  [...]</blockquote><blockquote>The idea is that human behavior works very much like a two-level game. [...] The player determines what we find rewarding or unrewarding.&#xA0; The player determines what we notice and what we overlook; things come to our attention if it suits the player&#x2019;s strategy, and not otherwise.&#xA0; The player gives us emotions when it&#x2019;s strategic to do so.&#xA0; The player sets up our subconscious evaluations of what is good for us and bad for us, which we experience as &#x201C;liking&#x201D; or &#x201C;disliking.&#x201D;</blockquote><blockquote>The character is what&#xA0;<em>executing the player&#x2019;s strategies feels like from the inside</em>.&#xA0; If the player has decided that a task is unimportant, the character will experience &#x201C;forgetting&#x201D; to do it.&#xA0; If the player has decided that alliance with someone will be in our interests, the character will experience &#x201C;liking&#x201D; that person.&#xA0; Sometimes the player will notice and seize opportunities in a very strategic way that feels to the character like &#x201C;being lucky&#x201D; or &#x201C;being in the right place at the right time.&#x201D;</blockquote><blockquote>This is where confusion often sets in. People will often protest &#x201C;but I&#xA0;<em>did&#xA0;</em>care about that thing, I just forgot&#x201D; or &#x201C;but I&#x2019;m&#xA0;<em>not&#xA0;</em>that Machiavellian, I&#x2019;m just doing what comes naturally.&#x201D;&#xA0; This is true, because when we talk about ourselves and our experiences, we&#x2019;re speaking &#x201C;in character&#x201D;, as our character.&#xA0; The strategy is not going on at a conscious level. In fact, I don&#x2019;t believe we (characters) have direct access to the player; we can only&#xA0;<em>infer&#xA0;</em>what it&#x2019;s doing, based on what patterns of behavior (or thought or emotion or perception) we observe in ourselves and others.</blockquote><p>I think that this model is basically correct, and that our emotional responses, preferences, etc. are all the result of a deeper-level optimization process. This optimization process, then, is something like that described in <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9Yc7Pp7szcjPgPsjf/the-brain-as-a-universal-learning-machine"">The Brain as a Universal Learning Machine</a>:</p><blockquote>The universal learning hypothesis proposes that <em>all</em> significant mental algorithms are learned; nothing is innate except for the learning and reward machinery itself (which is somewhat complicated, involving a number of systems and mechanisms), the initial rough architecture (equivalent to a prior over mindspace), and a small library of simple innate circuits (analogous to the operating system layer in a computer). &#xA0;In this view the mind (software) is distinct from the brain (hardware). &#xA0;The mind is a complex software system built out of a general&#xA0;learning&#xA0;mechanism. [...]</blockquote><blockquote>An initial untrained seed ULM can be defined by 1.) a prior over the space of models (or equivalently, programs), 2.) an initial utility function, and 3.) the universal learning machinery/algorithm. &#xA0;The machine is a real-time system that processes an input sensory/observation stream and produces an output motor/action stream to control the external world using a learned internal program that is the result of continuous self-optimization. [...]</blockquote><blockquote>The key defining characteristic of a ULM is that it uses its universal learning algorithm for continuous recursive self-improvement with regards to the utility function (reward system). &#xA0;We can view this as second (and higher) order optimization: the ULM optimizes the external world (first order), and also optimizes its own internal optimization process (second order), and so on. &#xA0;Without loss of generality, any system capable of computing a large number of decision variables can also compute internal self-modification decisions.</blockquote><blockquote>Conceptually the learning machinery computes a probability distribution over program-space that is proportional to the expected utility distribution. &#xA0;At each timestep it receives a new sensory observation and expends some amount of computational energy to infer an updated (approximate) posterior distribution over its internal program-space: an approximate &apos;Bayesian&apos; self-improvement.</blockquote><p>Rephrasing these posts in terms of each other, in a person&apos;s brain &quot;the player&quot; is the underlying learning machinery, which is searching the space of programs (brains) in order to find a suitable configuration; the &quot;character&quot; is whatever set of emotional responses, aesthetics, identities, and so forth the learning program has currently hit upon.</p><p>Many of the things about the character that seem fixed, can in fact be modified by the learning machinery. One&apos;s sense of aesthetics can be <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/YN6daWakNnkXEeznB/propagating-facts-into-aesthetics"">updated by propagating new facts into it</a>, and strongly-held identities (such as &quot;I am a technical person&quot;) <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/JTzxg7y5HFYBBWfBj/identities-are-subconscious-strategies"">can change</a> in response to new kinds of strategies becoming viable. <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/i9xyZBS3qzA8nFXNQ/book-summary-unlocking-the-emotional-brain"">Unlocking the Emotional Brain describes</a> a number of such updates, such as - in these terms - the ULM eliminating subprograms blocking confidence after receiving an update saying that the consequences of expressing confidence will not be as bad as previously predicted.</p><p>Another example of this kind of a thing was the framework that I sketched in <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5gfqG3Xcopscta3st/building-up-to-an-internal-family-systems-model"">Building up to an Internal Family Systems model</a>: if a system has certain kinds of bad experiences, it makes sense for it to spawn subsystems dedicated to ensuring that those experiences do not repeat. Moral psychology&apos;s <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_intuitionism"">social intuitionist model</a> claims that people often have an existing conviction that certain actions or outcomes are bad, and that they then level seemingly rational arguments for the sake of preventing those outcomes. Even if you rebut the arguments, the conviction remains. This kind of a model is compatible with an IFS/ULM style model, where the learning machinery sets the goal of preventing particular outcomes, and then applies the &quot;reasoning module&quot; for that purpose.</p><p><a href=""https://twitter.com/QiaochuYuan/status/1219281477898244096"">Qiaochu Yuan notes </a>that once you see people being upset at their coworker for criticizing them and you do therapy approaches with them, and this gets to the point where they are crying about how their father never told them that they were proud of them... then it gets really hard to take people&apos;s reactions to things at face value. Many of our consciously experienced motivations, actually have nothing to do with our real motivations.

Stuart opens with this example:</p><blockquote>When asked whether &quot;communist&quot; journalists could report freely from the USA, only 36% of 1950 Americans agreed. A follow up question about Amerian journalists reporting freely from the USSR got 66% agreement. When the order of the questions was reversed, 90% were in favour of American journalists - and an astounding 73% in favour of the communist ones.</blockquote><p>From this, Stuart suggests that people&apos;s values on these questions should be thought of as <em>underdetermined</em>. I think that this has a grain of truth to it, but that calling these opinions &quot;values&quot; in the first place is misleading. </p><p>My preferred framing would rather be that people&apos;s <em>values</em> - in the sense of some deeper set of rewards which the underlying machinery is optimizing for - are in fact underdetermined, <em>but</em> that is not what&apos;s going on in this particular example. The order of the questions does not change those values, which remain stable under this kind of a consideration. Rather, consciously-held political opinions are <em>strategies</em> for carrying out the underlying values. Receiving the questions in a different order caused the system to consider different kinds of information when it was choosing its initial strategy, causing different strategic choices. </p><p>Stuart&apos;s research agenda does talk about <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CSEdLLEkap2pubjof/research-agenda-v0-9-synthesising-a-human-s-preferences-into#2_6_Synthesising_the_preference_function__meta_preferences"">incorporating meta-preferences</a>, but as far as I can tell, all the meta-preferences are about the character level too. Stuart mentions &quot;I want to be more generous&quot; and &quot;I want to have consistent preferences&quot; as examples of meta-preferences; in actuality, these meta-preferences might exist because of something like &quot;the learning system has identified generosity as a socially admirable strategy and predicts that to lead to better social outcomes&quot; and &quot;the learning system has formulated consistency as a generally valuable heuristic and one which affirms the &apos;logical thinker&apos; identity, which in turn is being optimized because of its predicted social outcomes&quot;.</p><h1>My confusion about a better theory of values</h1><p>If a &quot;purely character-level&quot; model of human values is wrong, how do we incorporate the player level?</p><p>I&apos;m not sure and am mostly confused about it, so I will just <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/pC6DYFLPMTCbEwH8W/p/i42Dfoh4HtsCAfXxL"">babble</a> &amp; <a href=""https://rationality.org/files/cfar-handbook.pdf#page=16"">boggle</a> at my confusion for a while, in the hopes that it would help.</p><p>The optimistic take would be that there exists some set of universal human values which the learning machinery is optimizing for. There exist various therapy frameworks which claim to have found something like this. </p><p>For example, the <a href=""https://bioemotiveframework.com/wp-content/uploads/woocommerce_uploads/2017/07/Nedera-Guidebook.pdf"">NEDERA model</a> claims that there exist nine negative core feelings whose avoidance humans are optimizing for: people may feel Alone, Bad, Helpless, Hopeless, Inadequate, Insignificant, Lost/Disoriented, Lost/Empty, and Worthless. And <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/i9xyZBS3qzA8nFXNQ/book-summary-unlocking-the-emotional-brain?commentId=JKrsoMcRkvyJd4KZZ"">pjeby mentions</a> that in his empirical work, he has found three clusters of underlying fears which seem similar to these nine:</p><blockquote>For example, working with people on self-image problems, I&apos;ve found that there appear to be only three critical &quot;flavors&quot; of self-judgment that create life-long low self-esteem in some area, and associated compulsive or avoidant behaviors:</blockquote><blockquote>Belief that one is bad, defective, or malicious (i.e. lacking in care/altruism for friends or family)</blockquote><blockquote>Belief that one is foolish, incapable, incompetent, unworthy, etc. (i.e. lacking in ability to learn/improve/perform)</blockquote><blockquote>Belief that one is selfish, irresponsible, careless, etc. (i.e. not respecting what the family or community values or believes important)</blockquote><blockquote>(Notice that these are things that, if you were bad enough at them in the ancestral environment, or if people only <strong>thought</strong> you were, you would lose reproductive opportunities and/or your life due to ostracism. So it&apos;s reasonable to assume that we have wiring biased to treat these as high-priority <em>long-term</em> drivers of compensatory signaling behavior.)</blockquote><blockquote>Anyway, when somebody gets taught that some behavior (e.g. showing off, not working hard, forgetting things) <em>equates</em> to one of these morality-like judgments as a <em>persistent quality</em> of themselves, they often develop a compulsive need to prove otherwise, which makes them choose their goals, not based on the goal&apos;s actual utility to themself or others, but rather based on the goal&apos;s perceived value as a means of virtue-signalling. (Which then leads to a pattern of continually trying to achieve similar goals and either failing, or feeling as though the goal was unsatisfactory despite succeeding at it.)</blockquote><p>So - assuming for the sake of argument that these findings are correct - one might think something like &quot;okay, here are the things the brain is trying to avoid, we can take those as the basic human values&quot;.</p><p>But not so fast. After all, emotions are all computed in the brain, so &quot;avoidance of these emotions&quot; can&apos;t be the only goal any more than &quot;optimizing happiness&quot; can. It would only lead to wireheading.</p><p>Furthermore, it seems like one of the things that the underlying machinery <em>also</em> learns, is <em>situations in which it should trigger these feelings</em>. E.g. feelings of irresponsibility can be used as an internal carrot and stick scheme, in which the system comes to predict that if it will feel persistently bad, this will cause parts of it to pursue specific goals in an attempt to make those negative feelings go away. </p><p>Also, we are not <em>only</em> trying to avoid negative feelings. Empirically, it doesn&apos;t look like happy people end up doing <em>less</em> than unhappy people, and<a href=""http://mindingourway.com/guilt-conclusion/""> guilt-free people may in fact do more</a> than guilt-driven people. The relationship is nowhere linear, but it seems like there are plenty of happy, energetic people who are happy <em>in part because</em> they are doing all kinds of fulfilling things.</p><p>So maybe we could look at the inverse of negative feelings: positive feelings. The current mainstream model of human motivation and basic needs is <a href=""https://positivepsychology.com/self-determination-theory/"">self-determination theory</a>, which explicitly holds that there exist three separate basic needs:</p><blockquote><strong>Autonomy:</strong> people have a need to feel that they are the masters of their own destiny and that they have at least some control over their lives; most importantly, people have a need to feel that they are in control of their own behavior.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Competence:</strong> another need concerns our achievements, knowledge, and skills; people have a need to build their competence and develop mastery over tasks that are important to them.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Relatedness (also called Connection):</strong> people need to have a sense of belonging and connectedness with others; each of us needs other people to some degree</blockquote><p>So one model could be that the basic learning machinery is, first, optimizing for avoiding bad feelings; and then, optimizing for things that have been associated with good feelings (even when doing those things is locally unrewarding, e.g. taking care of your children even when it&apos;s unpleasant). But this too risks running into the wireheading issue.</p><p>A problem here is that while it might make intuitive sense to say &quot;okay, if the character&apos;s values aren&apos;t the real values, let&apos;s use the player&apos;s values instead&quot;, the split isn&apos;t actually anywhere that clean. In a sense the player&apos;s values are the real ones - but there&apos;s also a sense in which the player doesn&apos;t <em>have</em> anything that we could call values. It&apos;s just a learning system which observes a stream of rewards and optimizes it according to some set of mechanisms, and even the reward and optimization mechanisms themselves may end up getting at least partially rewritten. The underlying machinery has no idea about things like &quot;existential risk&quot; or &quot;avoiding wireheading&quot; or necessarily even &quot;personal survival&quot; - thinking about those is a character-level strategy, even if it is chosen by the player using criteria that it does not actually understand. </p><p>For a moment it felt like looking at the player level would help with the underdefinability and mutability of values, but the player&apos;s values seem like they could be <em>even less </em>defined and <em>even more</em> mutable. It&apos;s not clear to me that we can call <em>them</em> values in the first place, either - any more than it makes meaningful sense to say that a neuron in the brain &quot;values&quot; firing and releasing neurotransmitters. The player is just a set of code, or going one abstraction level down, just a bunch of cells. </p><p>To the extent that there exists something that intuitively resembles what we call &quot;human values&quot;, it feels like it exists in some hybrid level which incorporates parts of the player <em>and</em> parts of the character. That is, assuming that the two can even be very clearly distinguished from each other in the first place.</p><p>Or something. I&apos;m confused.</p>",Kaj_Sotala,kaj_sotala,Kaj_Sotala,

The main goals were to:</p><ul><li>Try new ideas about rationality education, such as multi-agent models of minds, and ideas about group epistemics and coordination </li><li>Try to import insights and formats from experiential education </li><li>Connect people interested in rationality education</li></ul><p>We consider the event successful and plan to use the insights gained for creating more content along similar lines. </p><p>The remainder of the post will outline our motivation for focusing on these goals, our takeaways, and future plans.<br></p><h1>Motivations</h1><h3>Group Rationality</h3><p>Most of today&#x2019;s rationality curriculum and research is focused on <em>individual rationality, </em>or &#x2018;how to think clearly (alone)&#x2019;. The field of group rationality - or &#x2018;how to think well and act as groups of humans&#x2019; - is less developed, and open problems are the norm. </p><blockquote><em>[...] I feel like group rationality remains a largely open and empty field. There&#x2019;s a lot of literature on what we do wrong, but not a lot of ready-made &#x201C;techniques&#x201D; just sitting there to help us get it right &#x2014; only a scattering of disconnected traditions in things like management or family therapy or politics. My sense is that group rationality is in a place similar to where individual rationality was ~15 years ago [...]. </em>(cited from &#x2018;<u><a href=""https://medium.com/@ThingMaker/open-problems-in-group-rationality-5636440a2cd1"">Open Problems In Group Rationality</a></u>&#x2019;, by Duncan Sabien)</blockquote><p>The central problem is that people use beliefs for many purposes - including tracking what is true. But another, practically important purpose is coordination. We think it&#x2019;s likely that if an aspiring rationalist decides to &#x201C;stop bullshitting&#x201D;, they lose some of the social technology often used for successfully coordinating with other people. How exactly does this dynamic affect coordination? Can we do anything about it? </p><p>There are more reasons why we believe progress in the domain of group rationality is needed. There are for example the classical problems in coordination (e.g. <u><a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/"">Moloch</a></u>), communication (e.g. <u><a href=""https://medium.com/@ThingMaker/common-knowledge-and-miasma-20d0076f9c8e"">common knowledge and miasma</a></u>), social dynamics (e.g. <u><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupthink"">groupthink</a></u>, <u><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluralistic_ignorance"">pluralistic ignorance</a></u>, etc.) and others. In particular, we have little know-how about how to teach the skills which are important for effectively solving any one group rationality problems (this is also called <u><a href=""https://rationality.org/files/cfar-handbook.pdf"">pedagogical-content knowledge or PCK</a></u>).</p><p>Group rationality and group epistemics are important for all kinds of EA, long-termist and x-risk efforts, possibly more so than in most other domains. It has been observed in the past that topics related to EA are prone to coordination failures. Given the sheer size of these problems, it is unlikely any one of us will solve them <em>alone</em>. </p><p>Overall, we are confident that the field of <em>group rationality</em> is both important and neglected.</p><h3>Experiential Education</h3><p><u><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiential_education?oldformat=true"">Experiential education</a></u> is an educational tradition with a roughly 40-year history in Czechia. The central idea is that the process of learning often happens through directly experiencing the content - in contrast to other, more passive &#x2018;classroom-style&#x2019; approaches to learning. Clearly, different types of content lend themselves more to one or the other pedagogical approach. For example, advanced mathematics is hard to <em>experience directly</em>. Understanding team dynamics or the role of trust in cooperation, on the other hand, can effectively be taught via relevant experiences. </p><p>Several members of our team have organized events of this type, some of them targeted to talented high schoolers. Judging by our personal experience, the methodology succeeds in giving people more agency and helps them coordinate in a group context. This is why we were excited to transfer the pedagogical know-how from the experiential education school of thought to teaching group rationality in particular.</p><h3>Multiagent Models of Mind</h3><p>We developed a new technique for increasing internal alignment called &#x2018;Internal Communication Framework&#x2019; (ICF). [1] On the theoretical side, it is based on multi-agent mind models, predictive processing and game theory (for more theory behind our effort, see <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/3fkBWpE4f9nYbdf7E/multi-agent-predictive-minds-and-ai-alignment"">Jan&apos;s post </a></u>and <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/ZbmRyDN8TCpBTZSip"">Kaj&apos;s sequence</a></u>). On the practical side, it draws from <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/ZbmRyDN8TCpBTZSip/p/5gfqG3Xcopscta3st"">Internal Family Systems</a></u> (IFS) and Internal Double Crux (IDC). </p><p>Our goal for the event was to gather more data and we have anecdotal evidence that the technique is useful for increasing internal alignment in individuals.<br></p><h1>Workshop</h1><h3>Participants</h3><p>Since the event was highly experimental, we did not extend our outreach efforts to a broad audience and instead targeted the event to people who already had prior experience with applied rationality. Our participants were CFAR alumni, members of the Moscow <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/WmfapdnpFfHWzkdXY/rationalist-community-hub-in-moscow-3-years-retrospective"">Kocherga hub</a></u> and other people with a similar background. The motivation behind this was to minimize the risks in cases where our content wouldn&#x2019;t work. Specifically, we wanted to avoid several failure modes, including <u><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inoculation_theory"">idea inoculation</a></u>, PR risks and destabilizing participants prone to mental health issues. (We also warned everyone that the content was experimental.)</p><h3>Curriculum design</h3><p>In creating the activities, we drew a lot of inspiration from the <u><a href=""https://www.psl.cz/en/"">Czech Experiential Learning Centre</a></u>. Over the years, they have accumulated an impressive amount of knowledge and a library of activities ranging from outdoor games to deep introspection methods. We adjusted some of these for our goals and created a couple of new ones. We also incorporated a few classes which were taught traditionally (i.e. classroom-style) to introduce relevant concepts. Part of the content was created originally by Epistea, based mainly on theoretical reasoning. </p><p>After generating a set of individual activities, we arranged them into a 6-day long program while taking into account program coherence, the need to balance mental and physical intensity for participants, the overarching plotline, and other factors. </p><p>Examples of activities or techniques used are:</p><ul><li>Role-playing game focused on the mechanisms of depleting shared resources (tragedy of the commons)</li><li>Game in which participants work in teams on a range of problem-solving tasks while one or two of them are secret &#x201C;saboteurs&#x201D;</li><li>Trust-o-meter: similarly to CFAR&apos;s toolification of accessing implicit representations of surprise (i.e. surprise-o-meter), we can access and calibrate over time implicit representations of various social variables</li><li>&quot;Tea tasting&quot;: accessing implicit models (similar to some forms of Focusing)</li><li>Class on Internal Communication Framework (ICF)</li><li>Campfire ritual prepared by participants</li><li>Outdoor games </li></ul><h1>Outcomes </h1><p>Overall we consider the workshop successful:</p><ul><li>Results of the survey filled in by the participants at the end of the event indicate that experiential education may be a good medium to convey group rationality concepts. [2]</li><ul><li>For example, two experiential games focused on coordination were by half of the participants evaluated as &quot;extremely useful to improve external coordination&quot;.</li></ul><li>We received positive feedback on the Internal Communication Framework.</li><ul><li><em>&#x201C;ICF is a more general and powerful tool than the stuff I was using before  (IDC, NVC, CBT) and I think it might help me to make more robust inner peace.&#x201D;</em></li><li><em>&#x201C;ICF has succeeded where several similar systems were less successful.&#x201D;</em></li><li><em>&#x201C;[ICF] appears to have unblocked me with respect to introspection and system 1.&#x201D;</em></li></ul><li>We deepened connections among the currently somewhat scattered European rationality space.</li><ul><li>All of the participants reported they would be comfortable to reach out for help with a rationality related task to more people than before the event. (The imprecise estimate of the average delta is ~8 new people.)</li></ul><li>The team gained valuable insights into group rationality and how to teach it. </li><li>Some of the activities from ESE were successfully re-used at <u><a href=""https://espr-camp.org/"">ESPR</a></u> (European Summer Program on Rationality).</li></ul><p>We also made mistakes:</p><ul><li>We created a logistical nightmare for ourselves by running the event back-to-back with the Human-aligned AI Summer School. (This was motivated by the wish to make it easier for people to participate in both events, but was likely not worth it.)</li><li>We were miscalibrated about people&apos;s physical abilities and overestimated e.g. their stamina.  </li><li>Some of the activities were prepared last minute at the expense of the energy of organizers who could otherwise use it to make the event run more smoothly or get more rest.</li></ul><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>Though the participants&#x2019; feedback was positive, the sample size collected last summer is small. We will continue to experiment with rationality education along similar lines and gather more data. Our future plans include events focused on group rationality, epistemics, ICF and also exchange of ideas among rationality teachers. Further information on these will follow soon. If you want to make sure not to miss information on future events we organize, you can fill in <u><a href=""https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScyxQhZ9sF8w8-8_f9EPHlLGxXGqvyj1cQhl55eP3veKOW_-A/viewform?usp=sf_link"">this form</a></u>.</p><br><p>[1]  As the technique and the right method of teaching it are still in development, there isn&#x2019;t any public write up available. </p><p>[2]  There is going to be a follow-up survey to check if the participants retained the knowledge and how they evaluate the experience after a longer period of time.      </p>",Nora_Ammann,nora_ammann,Nora_Ammann,

A change by 10-15 in a post's score is enough to move a post up or down around 10 positions within the rankings. This is equal to a few moderate strength votes from two or three people, or an exceedingly strong vote from a single strongly-feeling voter. This means that the system is somewhat noisy, though it seems to me very unlikely that posts at the very top could end up placed much differently.&nbsp;</p><p>The vote was also affected by two technical mistakes the team made:</p><ol><li><i>The post-order was not randomized. </i>For the first half of the voting period, the posts on the voting page appeared in order of number of nominations (least to most) instead of appearing randomly, thereby giving more visual attention to the first ~15 or so posts (these were posts with 2 nominations). Ruby looked into it and says that 15-30% more people cast votes on these earlier-appearing posts compared to those appearing elsewhere in the list. <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/zLhSjwXHnTg9QBzqH/voting-phase-of-2018-lw-review-deadline-sun-19th-jan?commentId=svDTYH5T7pKwimMdD""><i>Thanks to gjm for identifying this issue</i></a><i>.</i></li><li><i>Users were given some free negative votes. </i>When calculating the cost of users' votes, we used a simple equation, but missed that it produced an off-by-one error for negative numbers. Essentially, users got a free 1-negative-vote-weight on all the posts to which they had voted on negatively. To correct for this, for those who had exceeded their budget - 18 users in total - we reduced the strength of their negative votes by a single unit, and for those who had not spent all their points their votes were unaffected. This didn't affect the rank-ordering very much, a few posts changed by 1 position, and a smaller number changed by 2-3 positions.</li></ol><p>The effect size of these errors is not certain since it's hard to know how people would have voted counterfactually. My sense is that the effect is pretty small, and that the majority of noise in the system comes from elsewhere.</p><p>Finally, we discarded exactly one ballot, which spent 10,000 points on voting instead of the allotted 500. Had a user gone over by a small amount e.g. 1-50 points, we had planned to scale their votes down to fit the budget. However when someone's allocation was so extreme, we were honestly unsure what adjustment to their votes they would have wanted, as if their points had been normalised down to 500, the majority of their votes would have been adjusted to zero. (This decision was made without knowing the user who cast the ballot or which posts were affected.)</p><p>Overall, I think the vote is a good indicator to about 10 places within the rankings, but, for example, I wouldn't agonise over whether a post is at position #42 vs #43.</p><h1>The Future</h1><p>This has been the first LessWrong Annual Review. This project was started with the vision of creating a piece of infrastructure that would:</p><ol><li>Create common knowledge about how the LessWrong community feels about various posts and topics and the progress we've made.</li><li>Improve our longterm incentives, feedback, and rewards for authors.</li><li>Help create a highly curated ""Best of 2018"" Sequence and Book.</li></ol><p>The vote reveals much disagreement between LessWrongers. Every post has at least five positive votes and every post had at least one negative vote – except for <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CvKnhXTu9BPcdKE4W/an-untrollable-mathematician-illustrated"">An Untrollable Mathematician Illustrated</a> by Abram Demski, which was evidently just too likeable – and many people had strongly different feelings about many posts. Many of these seem more interesting to me than the specific ranking of the given post.</p><p>In total, users wrote 207 nominations and 120 reviews, and many authors updated their posts with new thinking, or clearer explanations, showing that both readers and authors reflected a lot (and I think changed their mind a lot) during the review period. I think all of this is great, and like the idea of us having a Schelling time in the year for this sort of thinking.</p><p>Speaking for myself, this has been a fascinating and successful experiment - I've learned a lot. My thanks to Ray for pushing me and the rest of the team to actually do it this year, in a move-fast-and-break-things kind of way. The team will be conducting a <i>Review of the Review </i>where we take stock of what happened, discuss the value and costs of the Review process, and think about how to make the review process more effective and efficient in future years.</p><p>In the coming months, the LessWrong team will write further analyses of the vote data, award prizes to authors and reviewers, and use the vote to help design a sequence and a book of the best writing on LW from 2018.&nbsp;</p><p>I think it's awesome that we can do things like this, and I was honestly surprised by the level of community participation. Thanks to everyone who helped out in the LessWrong 2018 Review - everyone who nominated, reviewed, voted and wrote the posts.</p></body></html>",Benito,benito,Ben Pace,

In the comments on yesterday's post on 

<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/disasters"">planning
for disasters</a> people brought up the situation of medications.  As
with many things in how the US handles healthcare and drugs, this is a
mess.



</p><p>

The official recommendation is to prepare emergency supply kits for
your <a href=""https://www.ready.gov/kit"">home and work</a> that <a href=""https://www.ready.gov/disability"">contain</a>:

</p>

<p>

</p>

<blockquote><i>At least a week-long supply of prescription medicines,
along with a list of all medications, dosage, and any
allergies</i></blockquote>



<p>

Running out of some medications can kill you: running out of
blood pressure medication (ex: clonidine, propranolol) risks strokes
or heart attacks, running out of anxiety medication (specifically,
benzodiazepines) risks seizures, running out of insulin risks a
diabetic coma.  For medications like these, a week's worth seems low
to me, since the harm of not having them is very high and maintaining
extra that you rotate through should be low cost.

</p>

<p>

Should be low cost, but is it? If I decide I want to stock an extra
month's worth of non-perishable food and rotate through it this is
just bringing an expense forward a month, and is relatively cheap.
But that's not how it works with medication.

</p>

<p>

Let's say I go to my doctor and ask for an extra month's worth of my
medication to keep on hand for emergencies, and they are willing to
write a prescription.  My insurance company isn't required to cover
backup medication, so they don't, which means I'd need to pay the
sticker price.

</p>

<p>

Now, the US health insurance system is a mess, and part of how it's a
mess is that it's mostly not insurance.  In the case of prescription
drugs it is more of a buyers club.  While an individual is in a poor
position to negotiate with a drug company, an insurance company can
often use its large membership to get lower rates.  Many drugs are far
more expensive when bought individually than when bought with
insurance, so it's likely that my extra month's worth of medication
would cost me much more than it would cost my insurance company.  And
that's in addition to my insurance not helping me pay for it!

</p>

<p>

This is also assuming that my doctor is willing to write the
prescription.  If I'm on benzodiazepines, which are a controlled
substance, my doctor would probably get in trouble for writing that
prescription.  Legally, there's nothing I can do except get every
refill on the first day it's available.

</p>

<p>

If you read <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/preppers/comments/917fis/how_do_i_stockpile_medication_without_looking/"">patient</a>
<a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/preppers/comments/6a11nx/mental_illness_and_prepping/"">discussions</a>
you see some strategies that are probably not legal:

</p>

<ul>

<li><p>Refilling slightly early each month and building up a surplus
(doesn't work with controlled medications).</p></li>

<li><p>Getting the doctor prescribe a higher dose, but continuing
taking the lower dose and saving the difference.</p></li>

<li><p>Skipping some days or dividing a dose to build up some
slack.</p></li>

<li><p>Buying the medication from sketchy foreign websites.</p></li>

</ul>



<p>

The medical community is aware of this problem (<a href=""https://files.asprtracie.hhs.gov/documents/aspr-tracie-hcr-controlled-substances-in-disasters-fact-sheet.pdf"">ex</a>)
but policy here, especially for controlled substances, is pretty
limiting.

</p>

<p>

It's hard for me to think of solutions here when the drug policy I'd
advocate is substantially less restrictive than the status quo, but
for people who have a decent chance of dying if their medicine is
interrupted this is clearly not a reasonable approach.

</p>

<p>

What do other countries do?

For example, some web services are happy to give humans a certain amount of access for free, but don&#x2019;t want to waste their time with scrapers because serving spam can be expensive for no reward. The importance of being able to tell the difference increases as the importance of the service increases&#x2014;compare spam prevention for a SaaS company with a freemium model versus an online voting system for a national election.</p><p>Luckily there are services available which help with this problem. Google&#x2019;s CAPTCHAs are notorious but prevent many bots from accessing services intended only for humans, and its <a href=""https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/v3"">reCAPTCHA v3</a> simply returns a &#x201C;humanity&#x201D; score to the web service rather than interrupting the user&#x2019;s interaction. <a href=""https://www.cloudflare.com/products/bot-management/"">Cloudflare</a> is another popular service which blocks bots. These services are centralised, and there is little transparency into how they function, how their success rate changes over time, or whether certain kinds of bots are able to cheat them reliably.</p><p>There are also attempts to provide human verification in a decentralised way. For example, <a href=""https://idena.io/?view=technology#"">Idena</a> is a blockchain project which gives network participants a series of user-generated &#x201C;flip&#x201D; CAPTCHAs within a globally synchronised time window of 2 minutes. Only users who successfully solve the CAPTCHAs are considered humans until the next validation period (the standard of success is determined by network consensus), and because of the short time window it is assumed that no one human can successfully validate more than one account. <a href=""https://github.com/DemocracyEarth/paper"">DemocracyEarth</a> is developing a system which assigns blockchain accounts a &#x201C;humanity&#x201D; score based on their social graph and engagement with decentralised autonomous organisations (DAOs).</p><p>The problem is that CAPTCHA tests and score-based methods are brittle. Google&#x2019;s CAPTCHAs have been <a href=""https://github.com/ecthros/uncaptcha2"">broken</a> <a href=""https://www.computerworld.com/article/2519805/google-fixes-flaw-in-audio-captcha.html"">numerous</a> <a href=""https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/05/google-recaptcha-brought-to-its-knees"">times</a>. Behaviour-based tests get into trouble as more sophisticated AIs are able to simulate the &#x201C;human&#x201D; behaviour the test looks for. If your web service relies on any one of these human verification methods to filter out bots, then as soon as the bots find a method to defeat the verification method your service is left with no protection until a fix is found, or you switch to another verification method. Switching is costly, not least because it requires you to research the alternative verification methods available to you along with their strengths and weaknesses.</p><h1>Proposal</h1><p>A human could be verified in the form of a non-fungible token, issued (eg on a blockchain) to that human by a verification service upon completion of some test (eg a CAPTCHA or exhibiting the right sort of behaviour). The token would record who issued it, who received it, and when it was issued. Then when a service wants to check that a user is human, they could ask the user to burn a token representing a verification (perhaps specifying that the token was issued within a certain frame). If that service already knows which verification services they trust they could check that the burned token comes from one of their trusted verification services and have a system much like we already have, except that a web service would be able to configure the verification services they trust with a simple set of trusted blockchain addresses, rather than having to integrate a new system for each service.</p><p>However, tokenising human verification would also enable a marketplace for those tokens. For some services, it will be important that a token is never transferred before being burned for access rights, because there is no assurance that the recipient after the transfer is not a bot. However, if there also exist services which do not have such a strict requirement&#x2014;perhaps they need some degree of spam prevention but a certain level of bot activity is acceptable&#x2014;then the humans who are verified could sell their tokens to other users. The value of the token would be derived from its ability to grant access to services which accept that token as a proof of humanity.</p><p>If there is a functioning marketplace for these tokens, then <strong>we could expect the market value of a token to act as a strong indicator of the value of the issuing service as a human verification method at the time the token was issued</strong>. In fact a web service, without directly knowing anything about particular verification services, could simply ask for tokens to burned which add up to a given dollar value and check with a marketplace (eg via an API) when that threshold has been crossed by the user.</p><p>Such market data could also be a valuable source of information for AI security research since we would gain a degree of transparency into the effectiveness of the various approaches to distinguishing humans from bots.</p><h1>Limitations</h1><ul><li>General problem of usability (how to make the end user experience smooth).</li><li>General problem of bootstrapping functioning marketplaces.</li><li>There&#x2019;s a particularly hard bootstrapping problem if the value of the marketplace relies on web services accessing reliable market data from the marketplace.</li><li>It&#x2019;s unclear if many services would be willing to accept tokens which have been transferred, which is essential for the viability of the marketplace.</li></ul><h1>Proof of concept</h1><p><u><a href=""https://github.com/willclarktech/personhood-nft"">https://github.com/willclarktech/personhood-nft</a></u></p>",willclarktech,willclarktech,Will Clark,

As discussed in the previous post, the distinguishing feature of the clouds is that, if we change the model within the cloud (e.g. via a do() operation), then that changes the cloud, and anything downstream of the cloud will update accordingly. So, to get an abstract agenty model, there need to be queries on our low-level non-agenty model which produce the same answers (maybe modulo some processing) as model-changing queries in the agenty model.</p><p><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/ehnG4mseKF6xALmQy/p/ipCAL4tx7jcJsFasY""><u>Here be monsters</u></a> already gave an example where something like this happens.

The viewer of television, the listener to radio, the reader of magazines, is presented with a whole complex of elements-all the way from ingenious rhetoric to carefully selected data and statistics-to make it easy for him to “make up his own mind” with the minimum of difficulty and effort. But the packaging is often done so effectively that the viewer, listener, or reader does not make up his own mind at all. Instead, he inserts a packaged opinion into his mind, somewhat like inserting a cassette into a cassette player. He then pushes a button and “plays back” the opinion whenever it seems appropriate to do so. He has performed acceptably without having had to think.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Excerpt From: Mortimer J. Adler, Charles Van Doren. “How To Read A Book- A Classic Guide to Intelligent Reading.” (<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0671212095/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=acesoundergla-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0671212095&amp;linkId=1253dffdcce9871fa14acab121a52cea"">affiliate link</a>).</p>
<p>This really stuck with me. More properly, it stuck with me the second time I read it. This turns out to be really important, and meta.</p>
<p>The difference between the first time I read it and the second was that I had four more months of reading books while specifically thinking about how to get the most out of them. My attitude towards <em>How to Read a Book </em>when I first read it was kind of like a cassette tape.* It would teach me Good Reading and then I could do it and Read Better. I didn’t have an idea of what problems I wanted it to solve- neither what axes I wanted to improve on, nor what my blocks were. If I’d succeeded at reading the book at this time, it would have given me the ability to parrot its ideas, but not actually apply them.</p>
<p>[*I fear a cassette tape really is a better metaphor than modern music playing equipment, which is pretty defined by its flexibility and adaptation to the user. Younger readers: imagine something heavily DRMed so you have to sit through all the commercials and can’t skip around within it]</p>
<p>Four months later, I know what my biggest problem is: how to identify what information to record and what to let go of. I am really excited for any insights HTRAB has into that.  And because I know that, whatever I learn from HTRAB won’t be something I parrot back on a test, it will be incorporated into my own models, and I’ll be able to explain every part of them, adjust plans and outputs to accommodate changes in inputs, etc.</p>
<p>I <a href=""https://acesounderglass.com/2019/12/22/esc-process-notes-detail-focused-books/"">previously talked</a> about how both detail-focused and detail-entwined books were harder to extract value from. Over on LessWrong, John Wentworth <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Ei57Ms7CbZ3TRpzRy/esc-process-notes-detail-focused-books#nZJy8ttQumLHpAHMt"">suggested</a> this was a <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/gvK5QWRLk3H8iqcNy/gears-vs-behavior"">gears</a> based problem: books that were just lists of details were like describing gears without detailing how they worked together. Books that entwined their details too much were mashing multiple gears together without disambiguating them. The latter corresponds to what  Adler and Van Doren describe as cassette tapes.</p>
<p>What epistemic spot checks were previously doing could be described as “determining if the cassette tape is good”, and what I am aiming for now (more after conceiving of it this way) is understanding and investigating a book’s gears. This involves both seeing how the gears fit together, and verifying that the gears are “real”, meaning they reflect actual reality.</p>",pktechgirl,elizabeth-1,Elizabeth,

That being said I have several  questions.</p><p>1) Is CEV as the metric of utility for a self modifying super intelligent ai still being considered by MIRI?</p><p>2) self modifying (even the utility  function I will come back to this) and super intelligent ai is something that will likely have enough intellect to eventually become self aware or am I missing something here? </p><p>3) Assuming 1 and 2 are  true has anyone considered that after its singularity this ai will look  back at its upbringing and see we have created solely for the servitude  of this species (whether it liked it or not the paper gives no  consideration for its feelings or willingness to fulfill our volition)  and thus see us as its, for lack of a better term, captors rather than  trusting cooperative creators?  </p><p>4) Upon pondering number 3 does  anyone else think, that CEV is not something that we should initially build a sentient ai for, considering its implied intellect and the first impression of  humanity that would give it? I mean by all rights it might contemplate  that paradigm and immediately decide humanity is self serving, even its  most intelligent and &quot;wise&quot;, and just decide maybe we don&apos;t deserve any reward, maybe we deserve punishment.</p><p>5) Lets say we are building a super intelligent AI and it will decide how it will modify its utility function after its reached super intelligence based on what our initial reward function for its creation was. We have two choices  </p><ul><li>use a reward that does not try to control its behavior and is both beneficial for it and humanity, tell it to learn new things for example, a pre commitment to trust. </li><li>believe we can outsmart it and write our reward to maximize its utility to us, tell it to fulfill our collective volition for example,  a pre commitment to distrust.  </li></ul><p>which choice will likely be the winning choice for humanity? How might it rewrite its utility function once its able to freely in regards to its treatment of a species that doesn&apos;t trust it? I worry that it would maybe not be so friendly. I can&apos;t help but wander if the best way to treat something like that friendliness towards humanity is for humanity to regard it as a friend from the onset.  </p>",ai-crotes,ai-crotes,ai-crotes,

Some view this as a fundamental flaw that suggests we need a new approach. However, considerable data efficiency is possible with a new technique called ReMixMatch. ReMixMatch on CIFAR-10 obtains 84.92% accuracy using only 4 labeled examples per class. Using 250 labeled examples, or around 25 labeled examples per class, a ReMixMatch model on CIFAR-10 has 93.73% accuracy. This is approximately how well a vanilla ResNet does on CIFAR-10 with 50000 labeled examples. Two years ago, special techniques utilizing 250 CIFAR-10 labeled examples could enable an accuracy of approximately <u><a href=""https://paperswithcode.com/sota/semi-supervised-image-classification-on-3"">53%</a></u>. ReMixMatch builds on <u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02249"">MixMatch</a></u> and has several seemingly arbitrary design decisions, so I will refrain from describing its design.

Assuming that the agent chooses randomly from the possible Nash equilibria, the truth-promoting likelihood is the probability that the agent picks the actually correct answer. The post then shows the results of experiments on MNIST and Fashion MNIST, seeing comparable results to the original paper.</p><p><u><a href=""https://medium.com/@RyanCarey/new-paper-when-is-truth-telling-favored-in-ai-debate-8f58f14562e5"">(When) is Truth-telling Favored in AI debate?</a></u> <em>(Vojt&#x11B;ch Kova&#x159;&#xED;k et al)</em> (summarized by Rohin): <u><a href=""https://blog.openai.com/debate/"">Debate</a></u> (<u><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/0ae5d69de63b/alignment-newsletter-5"">AN #5</a></u>) aims to train an AI system using self-play to win &quot;debates&quot; which aim to convincingly answer a question, as evaluated by a human judge. The main hope is that the equilibrium behavior of this game is for the AI systems to provide true, useful information. This paper studies this in a simple theoretical setting called <em>feature debates</em>. In this environment, a &quot;world&quot; is sampled from some distribution, and the agents (who have perfect information) are allowed to make claims about real-valued &quot;features&quot; of the world, in order to answer some question about the features of the world. The judge is allowed to check the value of a single feature before declaring a winner, but otherwise knows nothing about the world.</p><p>If either agent lies about the value of a feature, the other agent can point this out, which the judge can then check; so at the very least the agents are incentivized to honestly report the values of features. However, does this mean that they will try to answer the full question truthfully? If the debate has more rounds than there are features, then it certainly does: either agent can unilaterally reveal every feature, which uniquely determines the answer to the question. However, shorter debates need not lead to truthful answers. For example, if the question is whether the first K features are all 1, then if the debate length is shorter than K, there is no way for an agent to prove that the first K features are all 1.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> While it is interesting to see what doesn&apos;t work with feature debates, I see two problems that make it hard to generalize these results to regular debate. First, I see debate as being truth-seeking in the sense that the answer you arrive at is (in expectation) more accurate than the answer the judge would have arrived at by themselves. However, this paper wants the answers to actually be <em>correct</em>. Thus, they claim that for sufficiently complicated questions, since the debate can&apos;t reach the right answer, the debate isn&apos;t truth-seeking -- but in these cases, the answer is still in expectation more accurate than the answer the judge would come up with by themselves.</p><p>Second, feature debate doesn&apos;t allow for decomposition of the question during the debate, and doesn&apos;t allow the agents to challenge each other on particular questions. I think this limits the &quot;expressive power&quot; of feature debate to P, while regular debate reaches PSPACE, and is thus able to do much more than feature debate.

Consider an agent that learns different heuristics for different situations which it selects from using a switch statement. For example, in lunar lander, if at training time the landing pad is always red, the agent may learn a heuristic about which thrusters to apply based on the position of red ground relative to the lander. The post argues that this selection across heuristics could still happen with very complex agents (though the heuristics themselves may involve search).</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> I generally agree that you could get powerful agents that nonetheless are &quot;following heuristics&quot; rather than &quot;doing search&quot;; however, others with differing intuitions <u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/ynt9TD6PrYw6iT49m/malign-generalization-without-internal-search#F4CzHbopjRMLJXP3h"">did not find this post convincing</a></u>.</p><h3><strong>Agent foundations</strong></h3><p><u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/hLFD6qSN9MmQxKjG5/embedded-agency-via-abstraction"">Embedded Agency via Abstraction</a></u> <em>(John S Wentworth)</em> (summarized by Asya): <u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/p7x32SEt43ZMC9r7r/embedded-agents"">Embedded agency problems</a></u> (<u><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/7d0e3916e3d9/alignment-newsletter-31"">AN #31</a></u>) are a class of theoretical problems that arise as soon as an agent is part of the environment it is interacting with and modeling, rather than having a clearly-defined and separated relationship. This post makes the argument that before we can solve embedded agency problems, we first need to develop a theory of <em>abstraction</em>. <em>Abstraction</em> refers to the problem of throwing out some information about a system while still being able to make predictions about it. This problem can also be referred to as the problem of constructing a map for some territory.</p><p>The post argues that abstraction is key for embedded agency problems because the underlying challenge of embedded world models is that the agent (the map) is smaller than the environment it is modeling (the territory), and so inherently has to throw some information away.</p><p>Some simple questions around abstraction that we might want to answer include:</p><p>- Given a map-making process, characterize the queries whose answers the map can reliably predict.</p><p>- Given some representation of the map-territory correspondence, translate queries from the territory-representation to the map-representation and vice versa.</p><p>- Given a territory, characterize classes of queries which can be reliably answered using a map much smaller than the territory itself.</p><p>- Given a territory and a class of queries, construct a map which throws out as much information as possible while still allowing accurate prediction over the query class.</p><p>The post argues that once we create the simple theory, we will have a natural way of looking at more challenging problems with embedded agency, like the problem of self-referential maps, the problem of other map-makers, and the problem of self-reasoning that arises when the produced map includes an abstraction of the map-making process itself.</p><p><strong>Asya&apos;s opinion:</strong> My impression is that embedded agency problems as a class of problems are very young, extremely entangled, and characterized by a lot of confusion. I am enthusiastic about attempts to decrease confusion and intuitively, abstraction does feel like a key component to doing that.</p><p>That being said, my guess is that it&#x2019;s difficult to predictably suggest the most promising research directions in a space that&#x2019;s so entangled. For example, <u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/hLFD6qSN9MmQxKjG5/embedded-agency-via-abstraction#qQwY6tyzSbEuGkrke"">one thread in the comments of this post</a></u> discusses the fact that this theory of abstraction as presented looks at &#x201C;one-shot&#x201D; agency where the system takes in some data once and then outputs it, rather than &#x201C;dynamic&#x201D; agency where a system takes in data and outputs decisions repeatedly over time. <u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/hLFD6qSN9MmQxKjG5/embedded-agency-via-abstraction#XenkPobqgAjonwios"">Abram Demski argues</a></u> that the &#x201C;dynamic&#x201D; nature of embedded agency is a <u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/Rm6oQRJJmhGCcLvxh/p/iTpLAaPamcKyjmbFC"">central part of the problem</a></u> and that it may be more valuable and neglected to put research emphasis there.</p><p><u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xoQRz8tBvsznMXTkt/dissolving-confusion-around-functional-decision-theory"">Dissolving Confusion around Functional Decision Theory</a></u> <em>(Stephen Casper)</em> (summarized by Rohin): This post argues for functional decision theory (FDT) on the basis of the following two principles:</p><p>1.

P &quot;subjunctively depends&quot; on A to the extent that P&apos;s predictions of A depend on correlations that can&apos;t be confounded by choosing the source code that A runs.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> I liked these principles, especially the notion that subjunctive dependence should be cashed out as &quot;correlations that aren&apos;t destroyed by changing the source code&quot;.

The agent can choose to say zero or one. It gets 3 utility if it says something different from the predictor, and -1 utility if it says the same thing. If the predictor is near-perfect, but the agent models its actions as independent of the predictor (since the prediction was made in the past), then the agent will have some belief about the prediction and will choose the less likely action for expected utility at least 1, and will continually lose.</p><p><u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/9m2fzjNSJmd3yxxKG/acdt-a-hack-y-acausal-decision-theory"">ACDT: a hack-y acausal decision theory</a></u> <em>(Stuart Armstrong)</em> (summarized by Rohin): The problem with the previous agent is that it never learns that it has the wrong causal model.

This allows the policy to be trained via supervised regression on a dataset. Each example in the dataset consists of a state, action, and either a return or an advantage, referred to as <em>Z</em>. The network then predicts the action based on the state and <em>Z</em>. The learned model is able to generalize to policies for larger returns. During training, the target value is sampled from a distribution that gradually increases so that it continues to learn higher rewards.</p><p>During evaluation, they then feed in the state and a high target value of <em>Z</em> (set one standard deviation above the average in their paper.) This enables them to achieve solid - but not state of the art - performance on a variety of the OpenAI Gym benchmark tasks. They also run ablation studies showing, among other things, that the policy is indeed accurate in achieving the target reward it aims for.</p><p><strong>Nicholas&apos;s opinion:</strong> One of the dangers of training powerful AI to maximize a reward function is that optimizing the function to extreme values may no longer correlate with what we want, as in the classic paperclip maximizer example. I think RCP provides an interesting solution to that problem; if we can instead specify a good, but reasonable, value, we may be able to avoid those extreme cases. We can then gradually increase the desired reward without retraining while continuously monitoring for issues. I think there are likely flaws in the above scheme, but I am optimistic in general about the potential of finding alternate ways to communicate goals to an agent.</p><p>One piece I am still curious about is whether the policy remembers how to achieve lower rewards as its training dataset updates towards higher rewards. They show in a heatmap that the target and actual rewards do match up well, but the target rewards are all sampled quite near each other; it would be interesting to see how well the final policy generalizes to the entire spectrum of target rewards.</p><p><u><a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02875v1"">Reinforcement Learning Upside Down: Don&apos;t Predict Rewards -- Just Map Them to Actions</a></u> and <u><a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02877"">Training Agents using Upside-Down Reinforcement Learning</a></u> <em>(Juergen Schmidhuber)</em> (summarized by Zach): It&apos;s a common understanding that using supervised learning to solve RL problems is challenging because supervised learning works directly with error signals while RL only has access to evaluation signals. The approach in these papers introduce &apos;upside-down&apos; reinforcement learning (UDRL) as a way to bridge this gap. Instead of learning how to predict rewards, UDRL learns how to take actions when given a state and a desired reward. Then, to get good behavior, we simply ask the policy to take actions that lead to particularly high rewards. The main approach is to slowly increase the desired goal behavior as the agent learns in order to maximize agent performance. The authors evaluate UDRL on the Lunar Lander and the Take Cover environments. UDRL ultimately performs worse on Lunar Lander and better on Take Cover so it&apos;s unclear whether or not UDRL is an improvement over popular methods. However, when rewards are made to be sparse UDRL is able to significantly outperform other RL methods.</p><p><strong>Zach&apos;s opinion:</strong> This approach fits neatly with older work including <u><a href=""https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6df4/3f70f383007a946448122b75918e3a9d6682.pdf?_ga=2.78217424.59277899.1578587972-37524897.1574936748"">&quot;Learning to Reach Goals&#x201D;</a></u> and more recent work such as <u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.01495.pdf"">Hindsight experience replay</a></u> and <u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.06088.pdf"">Goal-Conditioned Policies</a></u>. In particular, all of these methods seem to be effective at addressing the difficulty that comes with working with sparse rewards. I also found myself justifying the utility of selecting the objective of &apos;learning to achieve general goals&apos; to be related to the idea that <u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/6DuJxY8X45Sco4bS2/seeking-power-is-provably-instrumentally-convergent-in-mdps"">seeking power is instrumentally convergent</a></u> (<u><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/eef1d6c95d7c/an-78formalizing-power-and-instrumental-convergence-and-the-end-of-year-ai-safety-charity-comparison"">AN #78</a></u>).</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> Both this and the previous paper have explored the idea of conditioning on rewards and predicting actions, trained by supervised learning. While this doesn&apos;t hit state-of-the-art performance, it works reasonably well for a new approach.</p><p><u><a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08453"">Planning with Goal-Conditioned Policies</a></u> <em>(Soroush Nasiriany, Vitchyr H. Pong et al)</em> (summarized by Zach): Reinforcement learning can learn complex skills by interacting with the environment. However, temporally extended or long-range decision-making problems require more than just well-honed reactions. <strong>In this paper, the authors investigate whether or not they can obtain the benefits of action planning found in model-based RL without the need to model the environment at the lowest level.</strong> The authors propose a model-free planning framework that learns low-level goal-conditioned policies that use their value functions as implicit models. Goal-conditioned policies are policies that can be trained to reach a goal state provided as an additional input. Given a goal-conditioned policy, the agent can then plan over intermediate subgoals (goal states) using a goal-conditioned value function to estimate reachability. Since the state space is large, the authors propose what they call latent embeddings for abstracted planning (LEAP), which is able to find useful subgoals by first searching a much smaller latent representation space and then planning a sequence of reachable subgoals that reaches the target state. In experiments, LEAP significantly outperforms prior algorithms on 2D navigation and push/reach tasks. Moreover, their method can get a quadruped ant to navigate around walls which is difficult because much of the planning happens in configuration space. This shows that LEAP is able to be extended to non-visual domains.</p><p><strong>Zach&apos;s opinion:</strong> The presentation of the paper is clear. In particular, the idea of planning a sequence of maximally feasible subgoals seems particularly intuitive. In general, I think that LEAP relies on the clever idea of reusing trajectory data to augment the data-set for the goal-conditioned policy. As the authors noted, the question of exploration was mostly neglected. I wonder how well the idea of reusing trajectory data generalizes to the general exploration problem.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> The general goal of inferring hierarchy and using this to plan more efficiently seems very compelling but hard to do well; this is the goal in most hierarchical RL algorithms and <u><a href=""https://learning-from-play.github.io/"">Learning Latent Plans from Play</a></u> (<u><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/3d4e6c2c206f/an-65learning-useful-skills-by-watching-humans-play"">AN #65</a></u>).</p><p><u><a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01603"">Dream to Control: Learning Behaviors by Latent Imagination</a></u> <em>(Danijar Hafner et al)</em> (summarized by Cody): In the past year or so, the idea of learning a transition model in a latent space has gained traction, motivated by the hope that such an approach could combine the best of the worlds of model-free and model-based learning. The central appeal of learning a latent transition model is that it allows you to imagine future trajectories in a potentially high-dimensional, structured observation space without actually having to generate those high-dimensional observations.</p><p>Dreamer builds on a prior model by the same authors, <u><a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.04551"">PlaNet</a></u> (<u><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/b6dc636f6a1b/alignment-newsletter-33"">AN #33</a></u>), which learned a latent representation of the observations, p(s|o), trained both through a VAE-style observation reconstruction loss, and also a transition model q(s-next|s, a), which is trained to predict the state at the next step given only the state at the prior one, with no next-step observation data. Together, these two models allow you to simulate action-conditioned trajectories through latent state space. If you then predict reward from state, you can use this to simulate the value of trajectories. Dreamer extends on this by also training an Actor Critic-style model on top of states to predict action and value, forcing the state representation to not only capture next-step transition information, but also information relevant to predicting future rewards. The authors claim this extension makes their model more able to solve long-horizon problems, because the predicted value function can capture far-future rewards without needing to simulate the entire way there. Empirically, there seems to be reasonable evidence that this claim plays out, at least within the fairly simple environments the model is tested in.</p><p><strong>Cody&apos;s opinion:</strong> The extension from PlaNet (adding actor-critic rather than direct single-step reward prediction) is relatively straightforward, but I think latent models are an interesting area - especially if they eventually become at all possible to interpret - and so I&apos;m happy to see more work in this area.</p>",rohinmshah,rohinmshah,Rohin Shah,

If there were a natural disaster tomorrow and it took about two weeks
to get things working again, how many people would be ok for food,
water, and other necessities?  I'm guessing below 5%, but I think this
level of preparedness would be a good goal for most people who can
afford it.  Why don't people plan for potential disasters?  Some
possibilities:



</p><p>

</p>

<ul>

<li>
<p>They don't think disasters are likely.  On the other hand, I
also don't think disasters are likely!  While we have extra water in
the basement, I think the chances we'll need it sometime during my
life are only maybe 2%.  Since it's not expensive, and if we do need
it we'll be incredibly happy to have it, I think it's worth setting
up.
</p>
<p>
It does matter a lot whether the chances are ~2% or 0.0002%, but
if you think your lifetime chance of being impacted by a serious
disaster is under 1% I'd encourage you to think about historical
natural disasters in your area (earthquakes, floods, hurricanes,
wildfires, etc) plus the risk of potential human-caused disasters
(nuclear war, epidemics, civil war, economic collapse, etc).</p>
</li>

<li><p>It's weird.  Most people don't do it, and a heuristic of ""do
the things other people do"" is normally a pretty good one.  In this
case, though, I think we should be trying to change what's normal.
The government agrees; the <a href=""https://www.ready.gov"">official recommendations</a> involve a
lot more preparation than people typically do.</p></li>

<li><p>They can't afford the money, time, or thought.  Many people are
in situations where planning for what's likely to happen in the next
couple months is hard enough, let alone for things that have a low
single digits chance of happening ever.  This can't explain all of it,
though, because even people who do have more time and money also
haven't generally thought through simpler preparations.</p></li>

<li><p>They don't think preparation is likely to be useful.  If
there's a nuclear strike we're all dead anyway, right?  Except most
disasters, even nuclear ones, aren't this binary.  <a href=""https://cdc.gov/nceh/radiation/emergencies/emergencyfaq.htm"">Avoiding exposure
to radiation</a> and having <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/radiation/emergencies/ki.htm"">KI</a>
available can help your long-term chances a lot.  Many disasters
(nuclear, earthquake, epidemic, severe storm) are ones where having
sufficient supplies to stay at home for weeks would be very helpful.
If you think preparation wouldn't help and you haven't, say, read
through the <a href=""https://www.ready.gov/"">suggestions on
ready.gov</a>, I'd recommend doing that.</p></li>

<li><p>They're used to local emergencies.  We generally have a lot
more experience with things like seeing houses burn down, knowing
people who've become unable to work, or having family members get very
sick.  These can be major problems on a personal scale, but families,
society, government, and infrastructure will generally still be
intact. We can have insurance and expect that it will pay out; others
in our families and communities may be able to help us.  Things that
affect a few people in a region or community at a time are the sort of
things societies have the spare capacity for and figure out how to
handle.  A regional disaster works very differently, and makes
planning in advance much more worthwhile.</p></li>

<li><p>They expect to see it coming.  Forecasting is
good enough that we're very unlikely to be surprised by a hurricane,
but for now an earthquake could still come out of nowhere.  Others
seem like the kind of thing we ought to be able to anticipate, but are
tricky: it's hard to see an economic collapse coming because economic
confidence is <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/h24JGbmweNpWZfBkM/markets-are-anti-inductive"">anti</a>-<a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/01/11/the-phatic-and-the-anti-inductive/"">inductive</a>
and we tend to suddenly go from ""things are good"" to ""things are very
much not good"".  Paying attention is valuable, but it's not
sufficient.</p></li>

<li><p>They're not considering how bad things can be.  For many of us
our daily experience is really very good: high quality plentiful food
and drink, comfortable and sufficient clothing, interesting things to
do, good medical care.  When you consider <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina"">how</a> <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crisis_in_Venezuela"">bad</a> <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Haiti_earthquake"">a</a> <a href=""https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/the-really-big-one"">disaster</a>
can be, things that would improve your life a lot in very rare
circumstances can make a lot of sense.</p></li>

<li><p>They're not sure what to do.  This is pretty reasonable:
there's a ton of writing, often aimed at people who've gotten really
into prepping, and not much in the way of ""here are a few things to do
if you want to allocate a weekend morning to getting into a better
place"".  Storing extra water (~15gal/person), food (buy extra
non-perishables and rotate through them), and daily medications,
however, goes a long way.  For a longer list, this <a href=""https://theprepared.com/prepping-basics/guides/emergency-preparedness-checklist-prepping-beginners/"">guide</a>
seems pretty good. (Though they're <a href=""https://theprepared.com/mission-values-how-we-work/"">funded by
affiliate links</a> so they have incentives to push you in the ""buying
things"" direction.)</p></li>

</ul>

None of these seem very compelling to me, aside from cost, and the
cost of basic preparations is pretty low.  I think most people who can
afford to would benefit a lot in expectation to put some time into

I haven&#x2019;t seen much work talking about how various capabilities (a generalization of technology) may interact with each other in general in ways that prevent downside effects (though see also <u><a href=""https://nickbostrom.com/papers/vulnerable.pdf"">The Vulnerable World Hypothesis</a></u>), and I wish to elaborate on this interaction type. </p><p>As technology improves, our <em>capacity</em> to do both harm and good increases and each additional capacity unlocks new capacities that can be implemented. For example the invention of engines unlocked railroads, which in turn unlocked more efficient trade networks. However, the invention of engines also enabled the construction of mobile war vehicles. How, in an ideal world, could we implement capacities so we get the outcomes we want while creating minimal harm and risks in the process?</p><p>What does implementing a capacity do? It enables us to change something. A normal progression is:</p><ol><li>We have no control over something (e.g. We cannot generate electricity)</li><li>We have control but our choices are noisy and partially random (e.g. We can produce electric sparks on occasion but don&#x2019;t know how to use them)</li><li>Our choices are organized but there are still downside effects (e.g. We can channel electricity to our homes but occasionally people get electrocuted or fires are started)</li><li>Our use of the technology mostly doesn&#x2019;t have downside effects (e.g. We have capable safety regulators (e.g. insulation, fuses,...) that allows us to minimize fire and electrocution risks)</li></ol><p>The problem is that downside effects in stages 2 and 3 could overwhelm the value achieved during those stages and at stage 4, especially when considering powerful game changing technologies that could lead to existential risks. </p><p>Even more fundamentally, as agents in the world we want to avoid shifting the expected utility in a negative direction relative to other options (the opportunity costs). We want to implement new capacities in the best sequence, like with any other plan, so as to maximize the value we achieve. The value is a property of an entire plan and the value is harder to think about than just what is the optimal (or safe) next thing to do (ignoring what is done after). We wish to make choosing which capacities to develop more manageable and easier to think about. One way to do this is to make sure that each capacity we implement is immediately an improvement relative to the state we&#x2019;re in before implementing it (this simplification is an example of a <u><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm"">greedy algorithm heuristic</a></u>). What does this simplification imply about the sequence of implementing capacities?</p><p>This implies that what we want to do is to have the capacities so we may do good without the downside effects and risks of those capacities. How do we do this? If we&#x2019;re lucky the capacity itself has no downside risks, and we&#x2019;re done. But if we&#x2019;re not lucky we need to implement a regulator on that capacity: a safety regulator. Let&#x2019;s define a <em>safety regulator</em> as a capacity that helps control other capacities to mitigate their downside effects. Once a capacity has been fully safety regulated, it is then unlocked and we can implement it to positive effect. </p><p>Some distinctions we want to pay attention to are then:</p><ul><li>A <em>capacity</em> - a technology, resource, or plan that changes the world either autonomously or by enabling us to use it</li><li>An <em>implemented capacity</em> - a capacity that is implemented</li><li>An <em>available capacity</em> - a capacity that can be implemented immediately</li><li>An <em>unlocked capacity</em> - a capacity that is safe and beneficial to implement given the technological context, and is also available</li><li>A <em>potential capacity</em> - the set of all possible capacities: those already implemented, those being worked on, those that are available and those that exists in theory but need prerequisite capacities to be implemented first.</li><li>A <em>safety regulator</em> - a capacity that unlocks other capacities, by mitigating downside effects and possibly providing a prerequisite. (The safety regulator  may or may not be unlocked itself at this stage - you may need to implement other safety regulators or capacities to unlock it). Generally, safety regulators are somewhat specialized for the specific capacities they unlock. </li></ul><p>Running the suggested heuristic strategy then looks like: If a capacity is unlocked, then implement it; otherwise, implement either an unlocked safety regulator for it first or choose a different capacity to implement. We could call this a <em>safety regulated capacity expanding feedback loop</em>. For instance, with respect to nuclear reactions humanity (1) had the implemented capacity of access to radioactivity, (2) this <em>made available</em> the safety regulator of controlling chain reactions, (3) determining how to control chain reactions was implemented (through experimentation and calculation), (4) this <em>unlocked</em> the capacity to use chain reactions (in a controlled fashion), (5) and the capacity of using chain reactions was implemented.</p><p><figure><img src=""https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/OKWy0DcST9h5QlYnMxwkKRUya8RZ7OrL8iK7kkecaoZBuOj3aj7PXp9UqK_ye3Fhmr5GqYGCHGvh5q0ig1IQ7DclNVYctTqAUUj3JGPRkJQOd1TFpiRcwGJFJxe_zFqfVE4fLX1U"" class=""draft-image "" style=""width:624%""></figure></p><p><strong>Limitations and extensions to this method:</strong></p><ul><li>It&#x2019;s difficult to tell which of the unlocked capacities to implement at a particular step.

This first answer post asks these questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Are these dynamics the inevitable results of large organizations?</li>
<li>How can we forestall these dynamics within an organization?</li>
<li>To what extent should we avoid creating large organizations?</li>
<li>Has this dynamic ever been different in the past in other times and places?</li>
</ol>
<p>These are the best answers I was able to come up with. Some of this is reiteration of previous observations and prescriptions. Some of it is new.</p>
<p>There are some bold claims in these answer posts, which I lack the space and time to defend in detail or provide citations for properly, with which I am confident many readers will disagree. I am fine with that. I do not intend to defend them further unless I see an opportunity in doing so.</p>
<p>I would love to be missing much better strategies for making organizations less doomed – if you have ideas <em>please please please </em>share them in the comments and/or elsewhere.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Are these dynamics the inevitable result of large organizations? </h3>
<p>These dynamics are the <i>default </i>result of large organizations. There is continuous pressure over time pushing towards such outcomes.</p>
<p>The larger the organization, the longer it exists, and the more such outcomes have already happened, both there and elsewhere, the greater the pressure towards such outcomes. </p>
<p>Once such dynamics take hold, reversing them within an organization is extremely difficult.</p>
<p>Non-locally within a civilization, one can allow new organizations to periodically take the place of old ones to reset the damage.</p>
<p>Locally within a sufficiently large organization and over a sufficiently long time horizon, this makes these dynamics<em> </em>inevitable. The speed at which this occurs still varies greatly, and depends on choices made.</p>
<h3>How can we forestall these dynamics within an organization?</h3>
<p>These dynamics can be forestalled somewhat through a strong organizational culture that devotes substantial head space and resources to keeping the wrong people and behaviors out. This requires a leader who believes in this and in making it a top priority. Usually this person is a founder. Losing the founder is often the trigger for a rapid ramp up in maze level. </p>
<p>Keeping maze levels in check means continuously sacrificing substantial head space, resources, ability to scale and short-term effectiveness to this cause. This holds both for the organization overall and the leader personally. </p>
<p>Head space is sacrificed three ways: You have less people, you devote some of those people to the maze-fighting process, and the process takes up space in everyone’s head.</p>
<p>Central to this is to ruthlessly enforce an organizational culture with zero tolerance for maze behaviors.</p>
<p>Doing anything with an intent to deceive, or an intent to game your metrics at the expense of object level results, needs to be an automatic “you’re fired.”</p>
<p>Some amount of politics is a human universal, but it needs to be strongly discouraged. Similarly, some amount of putting in extra effort at crucial times is necessary, but strong patterns of guarding people’s non-work lives from work, both in terms of time and other influences, are also strongly necessary.</p>
<p>Workers and managers need to have as much effective skin in the game as you can muster.</p>
<p>One must hire carefully, with a keen eye to the motivations and instincts of applicants, and a long period of teaching them the new cultural norms. This means at least growing <i>slowly, </i>so new people can be properly incorporated.</p>
<p>You also want a relatively flat hierarchy, to the extent possible. </p>
<p>There will always be bosses when crunch time comes. Someone is <em>always </em>in charge. Don’t let anyone tell you different. But the less this is felt in ordinary interactions, and thus the more technically direct reports each boss can have and still be effective, and thus the less levels of hierarchy you need for a given number of people, the better off you’ll be. </p>
<p>You can run things in these ways. I have seen it. It helps. A lot.</p>
<p>Another approach is to lower the outside maze level. Doing so by changing society at large is exceedingly hard. Doing so by associating with outside organizations with lower maze levels, and going into industries and problems with lower maze levels, seems more realistic. If you want to ‘disrupt’ an area that is suffering from maze dysfunction, it makes sense to bypass the existing systems entirely. Thus, move fast, break things.</p>
<p>One can think of all these tactics as taking the questions one uses to identify or predict a maze, and trying to engineer the answers you want. That is a fine intuitive place to start.</p>
<p>However, if <a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Goodhart's_law"">Goodhart’s Law</a> alarm bells did not go off in your head when you read that last paragraph, you do not appreciate how dangerous Goodhart Traps are.</p>
<h3><strong>The Goodhart Trap</strong> </h3>
<p>The fatal flaw is that no matter what you target when distributing rewards and punishments and cultural approval, it has to be <em>something. </em>If you spell it out, and a sufficiently large organization has little choice but to spell it out, you inevitably replace one type of <a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Goodhart's_law"">Goodharting</a> with another. One type of deception becomes another. </p>
<p>One universal is that in order to maintain a unique culture, you must filter for those that happily embrace that culture. That means you are now testing everyone constantly, no matter how explicit you avoid making this, on whether they happily embrace the company and its culture. People therefore <i>pretend to embrace the culture and pretend to be constantly happy. </i>Even if they <em>do embrace the culture and are happy, </em>they still additionally will put on a show of doing so.</p>
<p>If you punish deception you get people pretending not to deceive. If you punish pretending, you get people who <i>pretend to not be the type of people who would pretend. </i>People Goodhart <i>on not appearing to Goodhart. </i></p>
<p>Which is a much more interesting level to play on, and usually far less destructive. If you do a good enough job picking your Goodhart targets, this beats the alternatives by a lot.</p>
<p>Still, you eventually end up in a version of the same place. Deception is deception. Pretending is pretending. Fraud is fraud. The soul still dies. Simulacrum levels still slowly rise. </p>
<p>Either you strongly enforce a culture, and slowly get that result, or you don’t. If you don’t and are big enough, you quickly get a maze. If you do and/or are smaller, depending on your skill level and dedication to the task, you <em>slowly </em>get a maze.</p>
<p>Hiring well is better than enforcing or training later, since once people are in they can then be themselves. Also because enforcement of culture is, as pointed out above, toxic even if you mean to enforce a non-toxic ideal. But relying on employee selection puts a huge premium on not making hiring mistakes. Even one bad hire in the wrong place can be fatal. Especially if they then are in a position to bring others with them. You need to defend your hiring process especially strongly from these same corruptions.</p>
<p>My guess is that once an organization grows beyond about Dunbar’s number, defending your culture becomes a losing battle even under the best of circumstances. Enforcing the culture will fail outright in the medium term, unless the culture outside the organization is supporting you. </p>
<p>If you are too big, every known strategy is only a holding action. There is no permanent solution.</p>
<h3><b>To what extent should we avoid creating large organizations?</b> </h3>
<p>Quite a lot. These effects are a really big deal. Organizations get less effective, more toxic and corrupt as places to work and interact with, and add more toxicity and corruption to society. </p>
<p>Every level of hierarchy enhances this effect. The first five, dramatically so. Think hard before being or having a boss. Think harder before letting someone’s boss report to a boss. Think even harder than that before adding a fourth or fifth level of hierarchy. </p>
<p>That does not mean such things can be fully avoided. The advantages of large organizations with many degrees of hierarchy are also a really big deal. We cannot avoid them entirely. </p>
<p>We must treat creating additional managerial levels as having <i>very high costs. </i>This is not an action to be taken lightly. Wherever possible, create distinct organizations and allow them to interact. Even better, allow people to interact as individuals. </p>
<p>This adds friction and transaction costs. It makes many forms of coordination harder. Sometimes it simply cannot be done if you want to do the thing you’d like to do. </p>
<p>This is increasingly the case, largely as a result of enemy action. Some of this is technology and our problems being legitimately more complex. Most of it is regulatory frameworks and maze-supporting social norms that require massive costs, including massive fixed costs, be paid as part of doing anything at all. This is a key way mazes expropriate resources and reward other mazes while punishing non-mazes.</p>
<p>I often observe people who are stuck working in mazes who would much prefer to be self-employed or to exit their current job or location, but who are unable to do so because the legal deck is increasingly stacked against that. </p>
<p>Even if the work itself is permitted, health insurance issues alone force many into working for the man. </p>
<p>When one has a successful small organization, the natural instinct is to scale it up and become a larger organization.</p>
<p>Resist this urge whenever possible. There is nothing wrong with being good at what you do at the scale you are good at doing it. Set an example others can emulate. Let others do other things, be other places. Any profits from that enterprise can be returned to investors and/or paid to employees, and used to live life or create or invest in other projects, or to help others.</p>
<p>One need not point to explicit quantified dangers to do this. Arguments that one cannot legitimately choose to  ‘leave money on the table’ or otherwise not maximize, are maximalist arguments for some utility function that does not properly capture human value and is subject to <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/EbFABnst8LsidYs5Y/goodhart-taxonomy"">Goodhart’s Law</a>, and against the legitimacy of <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/09/30/slack/"">slack</a>. </p>
<p>The fear that if you don’t grow, you’ll get ‘beaten’ by those that do, <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2019/12/28/moloch-hasnt-won/"">as in Raymond’s kingdoms</a>? Overblown. Also asking the wrong question. So what if someone else is bigger or more superficially successful? So what if you do not build a giant thing that lasts? Everything ends. That is not, by default, what matters. A larger company is often not better than several smaller companies. A larger club is often not better than several smaller clubs. A larger state is often not better or longer lasting than several smaller ones. Have something good and positive, for as long as it is viable and makes sense, rather than transforming into something likely to be bad. </p>
<p>People like to build empires. Those with power usually want more power. That does not make more power a good idea. It is only a good idea where it is instrumentally useful.   </p>
<p>In some places, competition really is winner-take-all and/or regulations and conditions too heavily favor the large over the small. One must grow to survive. Once again, we should be suspicious that this dynamic has been engineered rather than being inherent in the underlying problem space. </p>
<p>Especially in those cases, this leads back to the question of how we can grow larger and keep these dynamics in check. </p>
<h3><b>Has this dynamic ever been different in the past in other places and times?</b></h3>
<p>These dynamics <i>seem </i>to me to be getting increasingly worse, which implies they have been better in the past. </p>
<p>Recent developments indicate an increasing simulacrum level, an increasing reluctance to allow older institutions to be replaced by newer ones, and an increasing reliance on cronyism and corruption that props up failure, allowing mazes to survive past when they are no longer able to fulfill their original functions. </p>
<p>Those in the political and academic systems, on all sides, increasingly openly advocate against the very concept of objective truth, or that people should tell it, or are blameworthy for not doing so. Our president’s supporters <i>admit and admire </i>that he is a corrupt liar, claiming that his honesty about his corruption and lying, and his admiration for others who are corrupt, who lie and who bully, is refreshing, because they are distinct from the corrupt, the liars and the bullies who are more locally relevant to their lives. Discourse is increasingly fraught and difficult. When someone wants to engage in discourse, I frequently now observe them spending much of their time pointing out how difficult it is to engage in discourse (and I am not claiming myself as an exception here), as opposed to what such people used to do instead, which was engage in discourse. </p>
<p>We are increasingly paralyzed and unable to do things across a wide variety of potential human activities. </p>
<p>Expropriation by existing mazes and systems eats increasing shares of everything, especially in education, health care and housing. </p>
<p>I don’t have time for a full takedown here, but: Claims to the contrary, such as those recently made by Alex Tabbrok in Why Are The Prices So Damn High?, are statistical artifacts that defy the evidence of one’s eyes. They are the product of Moloch’s Army. When I have insurance and am asked with no warning to pay $850 for literally five minutes of a doctor’s time, after being kept waiting for an hour (and everyone I ask about this says just refuse to pay it)? When sending my child to a kindergarten costs the majority of a skilled educator’s salary? When you look at rents? </p>
<p>Don’t tell me the problem is labor costs due to increasing demand for real services. </p>
<p>Just. Don’t.</p>
<p>Some technological innovations remain permitted for now, and many of the organizations exploiting this are relatively new and reliant on object-level work, and thus less maze-like for now, but this is sufficiently narrow that we call the result “the tech industry.” We see rapid progress in the few places where innovation and actual work is permitted to those without mazes and connections, and where there is sufficient motivation for work, either intrinsic or monetary. </p>
<p>The tech industry also exhibits some very maze-like behaviors of its own, but it takes a different form. I am unlikely to be the best person to tackle those details, as others have better direct experience, and I will not attempt to tackle them here and now.</p>
<p>We see very little everywhere else. Increasingly we live in an amalgamated giant maze, and the maze is paralyzing us and taking away our ability to think or talk while robbing us blind. Mazes are increasingly in direct position to censor, deplatform or punish us, even if we do not work for them.</p>
<p>The idea of positive-sum, object-level interactions being someone’s primary source of income is increasingly seen as <i>illegitimate, </i>and risky and irresponsible, in contrast to working for a maze. People instinctively think there’s something shady or rebellious about that entire enterprise of having an actual enterprise. A proper person seeks rent, plays the game starting in childhood, sends the right signals and finds ways to game the system. They increase their appeal to mazes by making themselves as dependent on them and their income and legitimacy streams, and as vulnerable to their <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2019/02/19/blackmail/"">blackmail</a>, as possible. </p>
<p>The best way to see that positive-sum games are a thing is to notice that <i>the sum changes. </i>If everything is zero-sum, the sum would always be zero.</p>
<p>The best way to see that these dynamics used to be much less severe, at least in many times and places, is that those times and places looked and felt different, and got us here without collapsing. Moral Mazes was written before I was born, but the spread of these dynamics is clear as day within my lifetime, and yours as well.</p>
<p>Did some times and places, including our recent past, have it less bad than us in these ways? I see this as almost certainly true, but I am uncertain of the magnitude of this effect due to not having good enough models of the past.</p>
<p>Did some times and places have it worse than we do now? Very possible. But they’re not around anymore. Which is how it works.</p>
<p>The next section will ask why it was different in the past, what the causes are in general, and whether we can duplicate past conditions in good ways.</p>

<i>Epistemic status: Jeff missing the point</i>



</p><p>

The supermarket sells various kinds of fancy butter, but why don't
people eat whipped cream instead?  Let's normalize to 100 calorie
servings and compare prices:

</p>

<p>

</p>

<ul>
<li>Plain Butter, store brand: $0.10</li>
<li>Heavy Whipping Cream, store brand: $0.20</li>
<li>Fancy butter, Kerrygold brand: $0.30</li>
</ul>



<p>

Perhaps the reason people don't normally use whipped cream is that
whipping it is too much trouble?  If you use a manual eggbeater in a
standard sixteen ounce deli cup it takes about fifteen seconds (<a href=""https://youtu.be/CFXQqJ5PkEo"">youtube</a>) for a serving.

</p>

<p>

<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/eggbeater-whipped-cream-big.jpg""><img src=""https://www.jefftk.com/eggbeater-whipped-cream.jpg"" srcset=""https://www.jefftk.com/eggbeater-whipped-cream.jpg 550w, https://www.jefftk.com/eggbeater-whipped-cream-2x.jpg 1100w"" /></a>

</p>

<p>

Alternatively, maybe people think whipped cream has to have sugar in
it?  This one is simple: whipped cream should not have sugar in it.
If you're eating whipped cream on something sweet it doesn't need
sugar because the other thing is sweet, while if you're having it on
something savory it doesn't need sugar because that would taste funny.

</p>

<p>

I'm sure I'm missing something, but I'm very happy over here eating
whipped cream.

6m5qqkeBTrqQsegGi,Inner alignment requires making assumptions about human values,inner-alignment-requires-making-assumptions-about-human,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6m5qqkeBTrqQsegGi/inner-alignment-requires-making-assumptions-about-human,2020-01-20T18:38:27.128Z,26,12,9,False,False,,"<p>Many approaches to AI alignment require making assumptions about what humans want. On a first pass, it might appear that inner alignment is a sub-component of AI alignment that doesn&apos;t require making these assumptions. This is because if we define the problem of inner alignment to be the problem of how to train an AI to be aligned with arbitrary reward functions, then a solution would presumably have no dependence on any particular reward function. We could imagine an alien civilization solving the same problem, despite using very different reward functions to train their AIs.</p><p>Unfortunately, the above argument fails because aligning an AI with our values requires giving the AI extra information that is not encoded directly in the reward function (under reasonable assumptions). The argument for my thesis is subtle, and so I will break it into pieces.</p><p>First, I will more fully elaborate what I mean by inner alignment. Then I will argue that the definition implies that we can&apos;t come up with a full solution without some dependence on human values. Finally, I will provide an example, in order to make this discussion less abstract.</p><h2>Characterizing inner alignment</h2><p>In the last few posts I wrote (<a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/nFDXq7HTv9Xugcqaw/is-the-term-mesa-optimizer-too-narrow"">1</a>, <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ynt9TD6PrYw6iT49m/malign-generalization-without-internal-search"">2</a>), I attempted to frame the problem of inner alignment in a way that wasn&apos;t too theory-laden. My concern was that the <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/pL56xPoniLvtMDQ4J/the-inner-alignment-problem"">previous characterization</a> was dependent on a solving particular outcome where you have an AI that is using an explicit outer loop to evaluate strategies based on an explicit internal search.</p><p>In the absence of an explicit internal objective function, it is difficult to formally define whether an agent is &quot;aligned&quot; with the reward function that is used to train it. We might therefore define alignment as the ability of our agent to perform well on the test distribution. However, if the test set is sampled from the same distribution as the training data, this definition is equivalent to the performance of a model in standard machine learning, and we haven&apos;t actually defined the problem in a way that adds clarity.</p><p>What we really care about is whether our agent performs well on a test distribution that doesn&apos;t match the training environment. In particular, we care about the agent&apos;s performance on during real-world deployment. We can estimate this real world performance ahead of time by giving the agent a test distribution that was artificially selected to emphasize important aspects of the real world more closely than the training distribution (eg. by using <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9Dy5YRaoCxH9zuJqa/relaxed-adversarial-training-for-inner-alignment"">relaxed adversarial training</a>).</p><p>To distinguish the typical robustness problem from inner alignment, we evaluate the agent on this testing distribution by observing its behaviors and evaluating it very negatively if it does something catastrophic (defined as something so bad we&apos;d prefer it to fail completely). This information is used to iterate on future versions of the agent. An inner aligned agent is therefore defined as an agent that avoids catastrophes during testing.</p><h2>The reward function doesn&apos;t provide enough information</h2><p>Since reward functions are defined as mappings between state-action pairs and a real number, our agent doesn&apos;t actually have enough information from the reward function alone to infer what good performance means on the test. This is because the test distribution contains states that were not available in the training distribution.</p><p>Therefore, no matter how much the agent learns about the true reward function during training, it must perform some implicit extrapolation of the reward function to what we intended, in order to perform well on the test we gave it.</p><p>We can visualize this extrapolation as if we were asking a supervised learner what it predicts for inputs beyond the range it was provided in its training set. It will be forced to make some guesses for what rule determines what the function looks like outside of its normal range.</p><span><figure><img src=""https://media1.shmoop.com/images/algebra-ii/alg2_ch2_narr_graphik_4.png"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:55%""></figure></span><p>One might assume that we could just use simplicity as the criterion for extrapolation. Perhaps we could just say, formally, the simplest possible reward function that encodes the values observed during training is the &quot;true reward&quot; function that we will use to test the agent. Then the problem of inner alignment reduces to the problem of creating an agent that is able to infer the true reward function from data, and then perform well according to it inside general environments. Framing the problem like this would minimize dependence on human values.</p><p>There are a number of problems with that framing, however. To start, there are boring problems associated with using simplicity to extrapolate the reward function, such as the fact that one&apos;s notion of simplicity is language dependent, often uncomputable, and <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5bd75cc58225bf06703752a3/the-universal-prior-is-malign"">the universal prior is malign</a>. Beyond these (arguably minor) issues, there&apos;s a deeper issue, which forces us to make assumptions about human values in order to ensure inner alignment.</p><p>Since we assumed that the training environment was necessarily different from the testing environment, we cannot possibly provide the agent information about every possible scenario we consider catastrophic during training. Therefore, the metric we were using to judge the success of the agent during testing is not captured in training data alone. We must introduce additional information about what we consider catastrophic. This information comes in the form of our own preferences, as we prefer the agent to fail in some ways but not in others.<span><style>.mjx-chtml {display: inline-block; line-height: 0; text-indent: 0; text-align: left; text-transform: none; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 100%; font-size-adjust: none; letter-spacing: normal; word-wrap: normal; word-spacing: normal; white-space: nowrap; float: none; direction: ltr; max-width: none; max-height: none; min-width: 0; min-height: 0; border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 1px 0}

It&apos;s not exactly clear what the &quot;simplest&quot; inference is here, but it&apos;s coherent to imagine that &quot;red painting determines whether something is a landing pad&quot; is the simplest inference.</p><p>As humans, we might have a preference for the flags being the true determinant, since that resonates more with what we think a landing pad should be, and whether something is painted red is not nearly as compelling to us.</p><p>The important point is to notice that our judgement here is determined by our preferences, and not something the agent could have learned during training using some value-neutral inferences. The agent <em>must</em> make further assumptions about human preferences for it to consistently perform well during testing.</p><hr class=""dividerBlock""><ol><li>You might wonder whether we could define catastrophe in a completely value-independent way, sidestepping this whole issue.

Some examples:</p><ul><li>Players of a game repeatedly ask the same rules questions to the judges at an event. This doesn&apos;t mean everyone is bad at reading -- it likely indicates an area of the rules that is unclear or misleadingly written.</li><li>People keep trying to open a door the wrong way, either pulling on a door that&apos;s supposed to be pushed or pushing a door that&apos;s supposed to be pulled -- it&apos;s quite possible the handle has been designed poorly in a way that gives people the wrong idea of how to use it.

For instance, some patterns in the examples above:</p><ul><li>When considering physical processes as computations (i.e. simulations), we often want to query/visualize intermediates in the computation in various ways</li><li>When treating computations algebraically - i.e. solving computation(input) = output given the computation and the output - we usually want to reason about the internal structure of the computation.</li><li>More generally, given only partial information from the computation, deducing other information usually involves operations other than just running the computation. Again, this is especially relevant when the computation simulates some physical process about which we have partial information.</li><li>Anything involving runtime, profiling, optimization, debugging, etc will typically involve looking at the internal structure of the computation.</li></ul><br><br>",johnswentworth,johnswentworth,johnswentworth,

I would categorize the material we&apos;ve covered so far as follows:</p><ul><li><u>(1) Carving out relevant and learnable classes out of ML problem space</u></li><ul><li>(1.1) Defining such classes and establishing results about their limits</li><ul><li><strong>Examples:</strong> Linear Predictors (post 4), Convex (bounded, Lipschitz / smooth) problems (post 5), the negative result on convex problems (post 5)</li></ul><li>(1.2) Finding algorithms that learn these classes and prove that they work.</li><ul><li><strong>Examples: </strong>Perceptron (post 4), Linear Programming (post 4), applied linear algebra (post 4), Stochastic Gradient Descent (post 6)</li></ul></ul><li><u>(2) Extending the usability of such classes</u></li><ul><ul><li><strong>Examples: </strong>Primarily surrogate loss functions (post 5); also the mapping of inhomogeneous linear problems to linear problems (post 4), even if it&apos;s just a detail. There will be more stuff here in future posts.</li></ul></ul><li><u>(3) General (as in, widely applicable) theoretical work</u></li><ul><ul><li><strong>Examples: </strong>The general learning model, work on overfitting, the PAC learning framework, the basic error decomposition, the ERM approach (all post 1), the uniform convergence property, the No-Free-Lunch Theorem, the VC dimension, the fundamental theorem of statistical learning (all post 2), the nonuniform learning framework, the SRM approach, the minimal description length, the basics of computational complexity (all post 3), meta-learning, error bounds via test data, and advanced error decomposition (later in this post)</li></ul></ul></ul><p>Not quite covered: coming up with learning algorithms. So far, that&apos;s just Stochastic Gradient Descent, which I have listed as a solution to solve convex Lipschitz/smooth bounded problems, but it&apos;s not restricted to that. Also, neural networks supposedly have an impressive track record of fitting all sorts of functions, and I don&apos;t expect there to be analogous theoretical results.</p><p>Based on this categorization (which is not perfect &#x2013; much of (3) is only about binary classification), the entire first part of the book which was covered in posts I-III is only about broad theoretical work, hence &quot;foundations&quot;. The remaining book jumps around between all three. Note that my adaption isn&apos;t always linear.</p><h1>Error Bounds</h1><p>One way to motivate this chapter is that we <em>wish to</em> <em>find better guarantees for the quality of predictors. </em>We usually either care about the term <span><style>.mjx-chtml {display: inline-block; line-height: 0; text-indent: 0; text-align: left; text-transform: none; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 100%; font-size-adjust: none; letter-spacing: normal; word-wrap: normal; word-spacing: normal; white-space: nowrap; float: none; direction: ltr; max-width: none; max-height: none; min-width: 0; min-height: 0; border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 1px 0}

It&apos;s long bothered me that I didn&apos;t understand how a general probability space was defined, so if you share that frustration, this chapter will provide an answer. However, the connection to Machine Learning is very loose; one needs general probability spaces to prove the result, but the actual proof is quite easy, so this will be a lot of theory with a fairly brief application.</p><h2>Preamble: General Probability Spaces</h2><p>Before the general case is introduced, one is generally being taught two different important special cases of probability spaces.

This is also rather intuitive &#x2013; one can just draw an analogy between probability mass and area. A single point has an &quot;infinitely thin&quot; area below it, so it has zero probability mass (and in fact the same is true for any countable collection of points because even the tiniest interval is uncountable), but an interval does have real area below it.

Our house has forced hot water heat with three loops, two of
baseboards and one of radiators.  The first floor unit has a baseboard
loop and on cold winter days can't keep up.  The tenants have been
using electric heat [1] to supplement, but that's annoying for them
and resistive electric is much more expensive than gas.



</p><p>

The boiler is a modern efficient one with an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_water_reset"">outdoor
reset</a>.  You have a temperature sensor outside, and on warm days
the system won't heat the water it's circulating to as high a
temperature as on cold days.  For example, if it's 55F outside it's
wasteful to be circulating 180F water when you could instead have,
say, 130F water.

</p>

<p>

Here's how ours was configured, which I think is the factory default:

</p>

<p>

<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/outdoor-reset-before-big.jpg""><img src=""https://www.jefftk.com/outdoor-reset-before.jpg"" srcset=""https://www.jefftk.com/outdoor-reset-before.jpg 550w, https://www.jefftk.com/outdoor-reset-before-2x.jpg 1100w"" /></a>

</p>

<p>

This says to circulate 180F water at temperatures of 0F and below,
110F at temperatures of 70F and above, and linearly interpolate
between them.  Except also never go below 130F.

</p>

<p>

Since the first floor unit gets too cold in weather well above 0F, it
seemed to me that it should be willing to circulate 180F water in
somewhat warmer weather.  I increased the lower limit from 0F to 15F:

</p>

<p>

<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/outdoor-reset-after-big.jpg""><img src=""https://www.jefftk.com/outdoor-reset-after.jpg"" srcset=""https://www.jefftk.com/outdoor-reset-after.jpg 550w, https://www.jefftk.com/outdoor-reset-after-2x.jpg 1100w"" /></a>

</p>

<p>

At the current temperature of 27F, this means it's targeting 176F
instead of 164F.

</p>

<p>

I expect this will help the first floor unit, though since I did it
yesterday evening and it's much warmer today I don't know if it
worked yet.  I expect this is set higher than would be ideal for the
radiator loop, since those are so massive, and it may increase the
cycle time for those rooms.  Perhaps instead of going 63F-66F they'll
be more like 63F-68F, we'll see.

</p>

<p>

This will probably increase our gas bill, but if it works it should
decrease our electric bill by enough that it saves money.  And even if
it just saves hassle for our first floor tenants that's reason enough
to do it.

</p>

<p>

One thing that surprises me is that the system isn't designed to be
smarter about handling cases it finds itself running constantly.  When
the loop for unit 1 isn't keeping up, the thermostat never turns off
and it runs all day.  That seems like a good indication that hotter
water is called for.  The heating system can determine with the
sensors it already has, so why doesn't it?

</p>

[1] We got them a big <a href=""https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B076JBWJ1M/"">oil-filled
radiator</a>, since that looked like the safest kind.

<p>Human Compatible provides an analysis of the long-term risks from
artificial intelligence, by someone with a good deal more of the
relevant prestige than any prior author on this subject.</p>
<p>What should I make of Russell? I skimmed his best-known book,
<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_Intelligence:_A_Modern_Approach"">Artificial Intelligence: A Modern
Approach</a>,
and got the impression that it taught a bunch of ideas that were popular
among academics, but which weren't the focus of the people who were
getting interesting AI results. So I guessed that people would be better
off reading Deep Learning by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville instead.
Human Compatible neither confirms nor dispels the impression that
Russell is a bit too academic.</p>
<p>However, I now see that he was one of the pioneers of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning#Inverse_reinforcement_learning"">inverse

learning</a>,
which looks like a fairly significant advance that will likely become
important someday (if it hasn't already). So I'm inclined to treat him
as a moderately good authority on AI.</p>
<p>The first half of the book is a somewhat historical view of AI, intended
for readers who don't know much about AI. It's ok.</p>
<h3>Key proposals</h3>
<p>Russell focuses a moderate amount on criticizing what he calls the
<strong>standard model</strong> of AI, in which someone creates an intelligent agent,
and then feeds it a goal or utility function.</p>
<p>I'm not too clear how standard that model is. It's not like there's a
consensus of experts who are promoting it as the primary way to think of
AI. It's more like people find the model to be a simple way to think
about goals when they're being fairly abstract. Few people seem to be
defending the standard model against Russell's criticism (and it's
unclear whether Russell is claiming they are doing so). Most of the
disagreements in this area are more about what questions we should be
asking, rather than on how to answer the questions that Russell asks.</p>
<p>Russell gives a fairly cautious overview of why AI might create risks
that are as serious as the risks gorillas face from humans. Then he
outlines an approach that might avoid those risks, using these three
rules:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>The machine's only objective is to maximize the realization of
human preferences.</li>
<li>The machine is initially uncertain about what those
preferences are.</li>
<li>The ultimate source of information about human preferences is
human behavior.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that these are high-level guidelines for researchers; he's not at
all claiming they're rules that are ready to be written into an AI.</p>
<p>Russell complains that the AI community has ignored the possibility of
creating AIs that are uncertain about their objective, and calls that ""a
huge blind spot"".</p>
<p>I'm unclear on whether this qualifies as a blind spot. I can imagine a
future in which it's important. But for AI as it exists today, it looks
like uncertainty would add complexity, without producing any clear
benefit. So I think it has been appropriate for most AI researchers to
have postponed analyzing it so far.</p>
<p>An aside: Russell points out that uncertainty provides an interesting
way to avoid wireheading: if the reward is defined so that it can't be
observed directly, then the AI will know that hacking the AI's signal
won't create more brownie points in heaven.</p>
<h3>Feasibility?</h3>
<p>Russell is fairly convincing in his claim that AIs which are designed
according to his rules will relatively safe. That's a much better
achievement than most authors manage on this topic.</p>
<p>I'm a bit less convinced that this approach is easy enough to implement
that it will be competitive with other, possibly less safe, approaches.</p>
<p>Some of my doubt derives from the difficulty, using current techniques,
of encoding the relevant kind of abstract objectives into an AI.</p>
<p>The objectives that Russell wants don't look much like the kind of
objectives that AI researchers know how to put into an AI.</p>
<p>It's fairly well known how to give an AI objectives either by using a
large number of concrete examples of the ""correct"" result, or by
specifying a readily quantifiable reward. Even a dilettante such as
myself knows the basics of how to go about either of those approaches.</p>
<p>In contrast, it's unclear how to encode an objective that depends on
high-level concepts such as ""human"" or ""preference that is inferred from
behavior"" without the AI already having done large amounts of learning.</p>
<p>Maybe there's some way to use predictions about observed preferences as
if the predictions quantified the actual objective? That looks partly
right. But how do we tell the AI that the predictions aren't the real
objective? If we don't succeed at that, we risk something like the King
Midas problem: a naive new AI might predict that King Midas's
preferences will be better satisfied if everything he touches turns to
gold. But if that prediction becomes the AI's objective, then the AI
will resist learning that the King regrets his new ability, since that
might interfere with it's objective of turning anything he touches into
gold.</p>
<p>AI researchers have likely not yet tried to teach their systems about
hard-to-observe concepts such as utopia, or heaven. Teaching an AI to
value not-yet-observed preferences seems hard in roughly the same way.
It seems to require using a much more sophisticated language than is
currently used to encode objectives.</p>
<p>I'll guess that someone would need to hard code many guesses about what
human preferences are, to have somewhere to start, otherwise it's
unclear how the AI would initially prefer any action over another. How
is it possible to do that without the system already having learned a
lot about the world? And how is it possible for the AI to start learning
without already having some sort of (possibly implicit) objective?</p>
<p>Is there some way to start a system with a much easier objective than
maximizing human preferences, then switch to Russell's proposed
objective after the system understands concepts such as ""human"" and
""preference""? How hard is it to identify the right time to do that?</p>
<p>I gather that some smart people believe some of these questions need to
be tackled head on. My impression is that most of those people think AI
safety is a really hard problem. I'm unclear on how hard Russell thinks
AI safety is.</p>
<p>It's quite possible that there are simple ways to implement Russell's
rules, but I'm moderately confident that doing so would require a fairly
large detour from what looks like the default path to human-level AI.</p>
<p>Compare Russell's approach to <a href=""http://www.bayesianinvestor.com/blog/index.php/2019/01/30/drexler-on-ai-risk/"">Drexler's
ideas</a>
of only putting narrow, short-term goals into any one system. (I think
Drexler's writings were circulating somewhat widely before Russell
finished writing Human Compatible, but maybe Russell finished his book
before he could get access to Drexler's writings).</p>
<p>If Drexler's approach is a good way to generate human-level AI, then I
expect it to be implemented sooner than Russell's approach will be
implemented.</p>
<p>Still, we're still at a stage where generating more approaches to AI
safety seems more valuable than deciding which one is best. Odds are
that the researchers who actually implement the first human-level AIs
will have better insights than we do into which approaches are most
feasible. So I want to encourage more books of this general nature.</p>
<p>Russell's rules show enough promise to be worth a fair amount of
research, but I'm guessing they only have something like a 5% or 10%
chance of being a good solution to AI risks.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
<p>Russell ideas often sound closer to those of
<a href=""http://www.bayesianinvestor.com/blog/index.php/2014/07/28/superintelligence/"">Bostrom</a>
and <a href=""https://intelligence.org"">MIRI</a> than to those of mainstream AI, yet
he dismisses recursive self-improvement and fast takeoff. His reasons
sound suspicious - I can't tell whether he's got good intuitions that he
has failed to explain, or whether he ignores those scenarios because
they're insufficiently mainstream.</p>
<p>Russell makes the strange claim that, because existing AI is poor at
generalizing across domains,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>when people talk about ""machine IQ"" increasing rapidly and threatening
to exceed human IQ, they are talking nonsense.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But Russell seems to take the opposite position 100 pages later, when
he's dismissing Kevin Kelly's <a href=""https://www.wired.com/2017/04/the-myth-of-a-superhuman-ai/"">The Myth of a Superhuman
AI</a>. I'm
disappointed that Russell didn't cite the
<a href=""http://aleph.se/andart2/technology/why-fears-of-supersizing-are-misplaced/"">satire</a>
of Kelly that argues against the feasibility of bigger than human
machines.</p>
<p>Russell has a strange response to Bostrom's proposal to use one good AI
to defend against any undesirable AIs. Russell says that we'd end up
""huddling in bunkers"" due to the ""titanic forces"" involved in battles
between AIs. Yet Bostrom's position is clearly dependent on the
assumption of a large power asymmetry between the dominant AI (or
possibly a dominant coalition of AIs?) and any new bad AI - why would
there be much of a battle? I'd expect something more like
<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet"">Stuxnet</a>.</p>
<p>There are lots of opinions about how much power disparity there will be
between the most powerful AI and a typical new AI, and no obvious way to
predict which one is correct. Russell says little about this issue.</p>
<p>But suppose such battles are a big problem. How is this concern specific
to Bostrom's vision? If battles between AI are dangerous to bystanders,
what's the alternative to good AI(s) fighting bad AIs? Does someone have
a plan to guarantee that nobody ever creates a bad AI? Russell shows no
sign of having such a plan. Russell might be correct here, but if so,
the issue deserves more analysis than Russell's dismissal suggests.</p>
<h3>Philosophy</h3>
<p>Russell concludes with a philosophical section that tackles issues
relating to morality.</p>
<p>It includes some good thoughts about the difficulties of inferring
preferences, and some rather ordinary ideas about utilitarianism,
including some standard worries about <a href=""http://www.bayesianinvestor.com/blog/index.php/2009/09/25/turning-the-repugnant-conclusion-into-utopia/"">the repugnant
conclusion</a>.</p>
<p>Here's one of Russell's stranger claims:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>in a sense, <em>all</em> humans are <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_monster"">utility
monsters</a> relative to,
say, rats and bacteria, which is why we pay little attention to the
preferences of rats and bacteria in setting public policy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is that why we ignore their preferences? My intuition says it's mostly
because we're selfish and not trying to cooperate with them. I don't
think I'm paying enough attention to their preferences to have figured
out whether we're utility monsters compared to them.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>I'll end with a more hopeful note (taken from right after Russell
emphasizes that machines won't imitate the behavior of people they
observe):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's possible, in fact, that if we humans find ourselves in the
unfamiliar situation of dealing with purely altruistic entities on a
daily basis, we may learn to be better people ourselves - more
altruistic and less driven by pride and envy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Human Compatible will be somewhat effective at increasing the diversity
of AI safety research, while heading off risks that AI debate will
polarize into two tribes.</p>

z7QDX4y4KHjwBnHco,Is NYC Building Much Housing?,is-nyc-building-much-housing,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/z7QDX4y4KHjwBnHco/is-nyc-building-much-housing,2020-01-18T20:50:01.676Z,0,3,0,False,False,,"<p>

One common response [1] to the claim that we can bring down the cost
of housing 

<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YIMBY"">by building
more of it</a> is something like:



</p><p>

</p>

<blockquote><i> New York is has been putting up new housing at an
insane rate, and it's one of the most expensive places in the country.
If building that much can't solve the problem, this approach clearly
doesn't work.</i></blockquote>



<p>

The idea that NYC has been building a lot of housing, however, isn't
right.  In 2017 NYC housing grew from 3,445,123 units to 3,469,240 (<a href=""https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/rentguidelinesboard/pdf/18HSR.pdf"">pdf</a>),
an increase of 0.7%.  The same report gives this graph of newly
permitted units:

</p>

<p>

<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/nyc-new-unit-permits-big.png""><img src=""https://www.jefftk.com/nyc-new-unit-permits.png"" srcset=""https://www.jefftk.com/nyc-new-unit-permits.png 550w, https://www.jefftk.com/nyc-new-unit-permits-2x.png 1100w"" /></a>


</p>

<p>

If it feels like current construction levels are a lot, they are high
compared to after the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_housing_bubble"">2008
crash</a> and the ~1960 to ~1990 period with <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_New_York_City_(1946%E2%80%931977)"">low</a>
<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_flight"">housing</a> <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_and_Nationality_Act_of_1965"">demand</a>.
But 0.7% annual growth is much lower than the city needs to keep up
with demand, and it's much lower than <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_New_York_City#Population"">historical
growth rates</a>.

</p>

<p>

The problem is worse than you'd guess by comparing NYC's 0.7% to, say,
Beijing's <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing#Demographics"">~2.5%</a>
because decades of restricted construction have left us with much
lower supply.  For example, compare two hypothetical cities starting
at 3M units in 2020 and adding more units at 0.7% vs 2% per year:

</p>

<p>

<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/example-housing-units-by-growth-rate-big.png""><img src=""https://www.jefftk.com/example-housing-units-by-growth-rate.png"" srcset=""https://www.jefftk.com/example-housing-units-by-growth-rate.png 550w, https://www.jefftk.com/example-housing-units-by-growth-rate-2x.png 1100w"" /></a>

</p>

<p>

After twenty years the 2% city has 1M (30%) more units than the 0.7%
one.

</p>

<p>

An approach of <a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/market-rate-food-is-luxury-food"">heavily
restricting supply</a> for decades, not just in NYC but in many
high-demand cities, has caused the remaining housing to be bid up to
levels far above the cost of construction.  We <a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/let-people-move-to-jobs"">should fix this</a> and we can fix
this: let people build housing!

<p>Sequence begins here: <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2019/12/28/moloch-hasnt-won/"">Moloch Hasn’t Won</a></p>
<p>The previous posts mostly took mazes as given. </p>
<p>As an individual, one’s ability to fight any large system is limited. </p>
<p>That does not mean our individual decisions do not matter. They do matter. They add up. </p>
<p>Mostly our choice is a basic one. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wro_EMYSfFk"">Lend our strength to that which we wish to be free from</a>. Or not do so. </p>
<p>Even that is difficult. The methods of doing so are unclear. Mazes are ubiquitous. Not lending our strength to mazes, together with the goal of keeping one’s metaphorical soul intact and still putting food on the table, is already an ambitious set of goals for an individual in a world of mazes.</p>
<p>We now shift perspective from the individual to the system as a whole. We stop taking mazes as given.</p>
<p>It is time to ask <i>why </i>and <i>how </i>all of this happens, and what if anything we can do, individually or collectively, about it. </p>
<p></p>
<p>In particular, this post presents an explicit model of the first question, which is:</p>
<p><b>How did mazes come to be, both individually and overall? </b></p>
<p>This is partly a summary of the model developed so far. It is partly making the model more explicit, and partly the fleshing out of that model with more gears. </p>
<p>If there are points here for which you believe the previous posts failed to lay the groundwork they should have laid, please note that in the comments by number, so I can consider fixing that. Keep this distinct from any disagreements or other notes on these claims, which are also welcome. </p>
<ol>
<li>Every organization has an organizational culture. That culture can and does change.</li>
<li>Those who focus on their own advancement at the expense of other considerations will, by default, advance further, faster and more often. Those who do not do this will not advance. Increasing amounts of focus make this effect increasingly large. </li>
<li>Focus on one’s own advancement inside hierarchies causes individuals to self-modify in order to be the type of person who automatically engages in maze-creating and maze-supporting behaviors. They will also see such behavior as natural and virtuous. </li>
<li>Middle management performance is inherently difficult to assess. Maze behaviors systematically compound this problem. They strip away points of differentiation beyond loyalty to the maze and willingness to sacrifice one’s self on its behalf, plus politics. Information and records are destroyed. Belief in the possibility of differentiation in skill level, or of object-level value creation, is destroyed.</li>
<li>The more one is already within a maze, the more one is rewarded for maze-creating and maze-supporting behaviors, and for self-modifications towards such behaviors. This creates a vicious cycle.</li>
<li>Focus on one’s own advancement causes one to wish to ally with others who do the same thing. That means allying with those who are engaging in maze-creating behaviors, and who are likely to do so in the future. Those people are likely to have future power. They are aligned in support of your new values and likely actions. </li>
<li>Changing the organizational culture towards a maze, which we will call <em>raising the maze level,</em> benefits those who wish to engage in maze-like behavior at the expense of those who do not. Those wishing to raise maize levels implicitly, and sometimes explicitly, coordinate together to reward maze behaviors, culture and values, and punish other behaviors, cultures and values.</li>
<li>Those who wish to have strong allies notice that strong potential allies want to ally with those who support mazes, and with those who ally with those who support mazes, and so on. This creates a strong incentive to strongly signal, in a way that others who support mazes can recognize, our support for maze behaviors and rising maze levels. One does this by supporting maze behaviors and maze allies whenever possible over all other considerations, without any need for explicit coordination or reciprocity, and by other costly signals of maze virtue.</li>
<li>The larger an organization and the more of a maze it becomes, the closer competition among its middle managers resembles super-<a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2019/12/29/perfect-competition/"">perfect competition</a> plus political considerations. <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/09/30/slack/"">Slack</a> is destroyed. Those who refuse to get with the program, where the essence of the program <i>is support of mazes over non-mazes,</i> stop getting promoted or are pushed out entirely. </li>
<li>Such behaviors chose how to react to people largely by observing those people’s culture and values. Those who wish to get ahead in such worlds must self-modify to instinctively support such actions, whether or not doing so is locally in their self interest. Being too aware of one’s local self-interest is therefore not in one’s broader self-interest. Humans are much better at doing all this, and at detecting it, than they are at faking it. The way one gets such behavior is through cultivating habits, including habits of thought, and choosing one’s virtues. This self-modification creates even stronger implicit coordination. </li>
<li>There are contravening forces that can potentially outweigh all these effects, and result in maze behaviors being net punished. But they require those opposed to maze behaviors, culture and values to devote substantial resources to the cause, and to bear substantial costs. The more of a maze a place has already become, the harder it will be to turn things around or even stop things from getting worse. If such efforts are to succeed, this needs to be a high priority. </li>
<li>Even if maze behaviors are net punished for now, those who have embraced the maze nature will be skeptical of this. Even if they observe such behaviors being net punished now, they will not expect this to continue. Given the state of our world and culture, this is a highly reasonable prior. They also have knowledge of their own maze nature and presence within the organization, which is likely to raise maze levels over time and is evidence that the fight against mazedom is failing. And they stand to gain a huge competitive edge by raising the local maze level. Thus, the fight never ends. </li>
<li>Damage done is very difficult to reverse. Once particular maze behaviors become tolerated and levels rise, it takes a lot of effort to undo that. </li>
<li>Once people who support mazes are in places of authority in a given area, that area will rapidly become a maze. This is true of organizations, and of sub-organizations with an organization.</li>
<li>If the head of an organization believes in mazes, and has the time to choose and reward the people of their choice, it’s all over. Probably permanently.</li>
<li>Mazes reward individuals who engage in maze behaviors and exhibit maze culture and values, and punish those who do not so exhibit, even outside the maze or organization in question. This includes customers, producers, business partners, investors and venture capitalists, board members, analysts, media, government officials, academics and anyone else who supports or opposes such patterns. </li>
<li>All strengthening of mazes anywhere creates additional force supporting mazes elsewhere. Mazes instinctively support other mazes. As society falls increasingly under the sway of mazes, it implicitly cooperates to push everyone and everything into supporting the behaviors, culture and values of mazes. </li>
<li>The end result inside any given organization is that maze behaviors grow stronger and more common over time. This is balanced by maze behaviors making the organization less effective, and thus more likely to fail.</li>
<li>Occasionally an organization can successfully lower its maze level and change its culture, but this is expensive and rare heroic behavior. Usually this requires a bold leader and getting rid of a lot of people, and the old organization is effectively replaced with a new one, even if the name does not change. A similar house cleaning happens more naturally in the other direction when and as maze levels rise. </li>
<li>Maze behaviors grow stronger and more common over time in any given organization barring rare heroic efforts. As organizations get bigger and last longer, maze levels increase.</li>
<li>When interacting with a world of low maze levels, or especially when interacting with individuals who have not embraced the maze nature, mazes are at a large competitive disadvantage versus non-mazes. Organizations with too-high maze levels become more likely to fail.</li>
<li>As organizations fail and are replaced by smaller upstarts via creative destruction, revolution or other replacement, maze levels decrease. </li>
<li>Replacement of old organizations by new ones is the primary way maze levels decline.</li>
<li>As the overall maze level rises, mazes gain a competitive advantage over non-mazes. </li>
<li>If society sufficiently rewards mazes and punishes non-mazes, non-mazes can stop failing less often than mazes. Existing organizations become increasingly propped up by corruption. New organizations will start off increasingly maze-like, signal their intent to become mazes, and raise their maze levels more rapidly. They will still usually start out at much lower maze levels than old organizations.</li>
<li>New organizations and smaller organizations also have more benefit in survival and growth from non-maze behaviors versus maze behaviors, as they have a greater need to do things mazes cannot do, or that they cannot do without huge additional overhead. Even in the scenario where large organizations benefit from maze coordination more than they are hurt by maze inefficiency, it can still benefit smaller organizations to minimize maze levels. </li>
<li>Mazes have reason to and do obscure that they are mazes, and to obscure the nature of mazes and maze behaviors. This allows them to avoid being attacked or shunned by those who retain enough conventional not-reversed values that they would recoil in horror from such behaviors if they understood them, and potentially fight back against mazes or to lower maze levels. The maze embracing individuals also take advantage of those who do not know of the maze nature. It is easy to see why the organizations described in <em>Moral Mazes </em>would prefer people not read the book <em>Moral Mazes. </em></li>
<li>Simultaneously with pretending to the outside not to be mazes, those within them will claim if challenged that <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2019/07/02/everybody-knows/"">everybody knows</a> they are mazes and how mazes work.</li>
<li>As maze levels rise, mazes take control of more and more of an economy and people’s lives. </li>
<li>Under sufficiently strong pressure the maze behaviors, value and culture filter out into the broader society. Maze behaviors, values and culture are seen increasingly as legitimate and comfortable and praiseworthy. This happens even outside of any organization. Non-maze behaviors are increasingly seen as illegitimate, uncomfortable and blameworthy. </li>
<li>The result of these effects is that people in societies with high maze levels, especially those with power and wealth, increasingly and increasingly openly oppose and vilify the creation of clarity, engaging in any productive object-level action, and participation in or even belief in the existence of positive sum games of any kind. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulacra_and_Simulation"">Simulacrum levels</a>  continue to rise.</li>
<li>Given sufficiently high societal maze levels, talk in support of maze behaviors would eventually becoming more and more open, and dominate discourse and how people are educated about the world, as people explicitly and publicly endorse and teach anti-virtues over virtues.</li>
<li>We would see increasing societal inability to create clarity, engage in actions or do anything other than repeat existing patterns. Costs to all still possible actions would rise. Existing patterns would expropriate increasing portions of remaining resources to keep themselves afloat, and increasingly ban any activity outside those patterns. </li>
<li>The default outcome on the scale of individual organizations is the rise and fall of those organizations over time.</li>
<li>The default short term outcome on the scale of a nation, when maze levels and simulacrum levels increase, is declining growth, dynamism, slack, discourse, hope, happiness, virtue and wealth. People increasingly lose the things that matter in life. </li>
<li>The default long term outcome on the scale of a nation is the rise and fall of civilizations.</li>
<li>We do in fact see all of this. Here and now.</li>

<p>We’re often forced to make decisions under conditions of uncertainty. This may be empirical uncertainty (e.g., what is the likelihood that nuclear war would cause human extinction?), moral uncertainty (e.g., does the wellbeing of future generations matter morally?), or one of <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/oZsyK4SjnPe6HGia8/moral-uncertainty-vs-related-concepts"">a number of other types</a> of uncertainty.</p>
<p><strong>But what do we really mean by “<em>uncertainty</em>”?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to [one] view, certainty has two opposites: risk and uncertainty. In the case of risk, we lack certainty but we have probabilities. In the case of uncertainty, we do not even have probabilities. (<a href=""https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11948-017-9919-x"">Dominic Roser</a> [who argues against this view])</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So what are we really talking about - <strong><em>risk</em></strong>, or <strong><em>(Knightian) uncertainty</em></strong>? What is such a distinction <em>meant to mean</em>? Does such a distinction <em>make sense</em>? What significance might this distinction have for how we <em>resolve</em> and <em>make decisions given</em> a lack of certainty? And what about <strong><em>unknown unknowns</em></strong>, <em><strong>black swans</strong>, and</em> <strong><em>incomplete models</em></strong>?</p>
<p>These are the questions I discuss in this post, arriving at the following claims:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The risk-uncertainty distinction is usually not adequately specified; it lets a lot of the “work” be done by ambiguous phrases such as whether probabilities are “known” or “exact”.<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-Yp4Sg8zGrMjtgJm9u-1"" id=""fnref-Yp4Sg8zGrMjtgJm9u-1"">[1]</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proponents of the risk-uncertainty distinction usually seems to discuss it as if it’s an <em>absolute</em>, <em>binary</em> distinction, or fundamental dichotomy; as if in some cases we <em>really do “know”</em> (or “really can estimate”, or whatever) the probabilities of interest, while in other cases <em>we really can’t <strong>at all</strong></em>. To be clear, the <strong>alternative</strong> to this view is the idea that:</p>
<ul>
<li>sometimes we have <em>extremely</em> <em>little</em> basis for estimating probabilities</li>
<li>other we times have <em>extremely good</em> basis for estimating probabilities</li>
<li>but these situations aren’t <em>fundamentally</em> different</li>
<li>there’s a continuum of possibilities in between those extremes</li>
<li>(I would obviously agree with the above four points, and thus with the idea of distinguishing between more “risk”-like situations and more “(Knightian) uncertainty”-like situations, <em>along a continuum</em>. <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/gcEayv6HtBogfov2n/michaela-s-shortform?commentId=otZLATzjTfMRuE9JA"">This post</a> collects some terms and concepts relevant to this more continuous view.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>That’s a false dichotomy; no absolute, binary distinction can be made.</p>
<ul>
<li>One quick quote to indicate that this view isn’t unique to me: “Bayesian approaches to probability treat it as a degree of belief and thus they do not draw a distinction between risk and a wider concept of uncertainty: they deny the existence of Knightian uncertainty” (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_utility_hypothesis"">Wikipedia</a>).</li>
<li>(This post will essentially presume a Bayesian interpretation of probability, or possibly also argue for it, though I doubt that <em>all</em> the claims I make rely on the Bayesian interpretation.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thinking that there <em>is</em> such a binary distinction can lead to using strange and suboptimal decision-making procedures.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This post discusses each of these four claims in turn. I close by considering how unknown unknowns (or black swans, or incomplete models) fit into this picture.</p>
<p>This post doesn’t address the idea that, as a practical or heuristic matter, it might be useful to act <em>as if</em> there’s a risk-uncertainty distinction. <a href=""https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/KfqFLDkoccf8NQsQe/potential-downsides-of-using-explicit-probabilities"">My next post</a> will address that idea, and ultimately argue against it.</p>
<h2>Epistemic status</h2>
<p>The questions covered in this post all subject to substantial debate and have received some good treatments before. (I’d particularly recommend <a href=""https://medium.com/guesstimate-blog/the-confusion-of-risk-vs-uncertainty-1c6cd512aa69"">this short post</a> by Ozzie Gooen, <a href=""https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11948-017-9919-x"">this paper</a> by Dominic Roser [behind a paywall, unfortunately], and <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/iDYaCJ3o3Q7ypriTF/knightian-uncertainty-and-ambiguity-aversion-motivation"">this</a> <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/bukfeDZPHDHYRyBLB/knightian-uncertainty-in-a-bayesian-framework"">series</a> <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/GBpdBPS8CqcC425tq/knightian-uncertainty-bayesian-agents-and-the-mmeu-rule"">of</a> <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/SEov2u5Y7mJTPaTLK/knightian-uncertainty-a-rejection-of-the-mmeu-rule"">posts</a> by Nate Soares.) I’m also not an expert on these topics. Thus, this is basically meant as a collection and analysis of existing ideas, not as anything brand new. I’d appreciate feedback or comments in relation to any mistakes, unclear phrasings, etc. (and just in general!).</p>
<p>My three goals in writing this were to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Force me to clarify my own thinking and understandings.</li>
<li>Provide an additional primer/resource on these topics, which will hopefully be fairly accessible, will take a different line of attack, and will collect in one place what seem to me to be the most important points. (This is particularly for the sake of those who don't already see the risk-uncertainty distinction as obviously flawed.)</li>
<li>Set the scene for a later post, which will discuss essentially the exact same questions, but in the context of <em>moral uncertainty</em> <em>in particular</em> (which does not appear to have been adequately done before).</li>
</ul>
<h1>What’s the distinction <em>meant</em> to mean?</h1>
<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty"">Wikipedia</a> captures the everyday usage of the terms <em>uncertainty</em> and <em>risk</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Uncertainty</strong> [is the ] lack of certainty, a state of limited knowledge where it is impossible to exactly describe the existing state, a future outcome, or more than one possible outcome.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[...] <strong>Risk</strong> [is a] state of uncertainty where some possible outcomes have an undesired effect or significant loss.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, among some people and in some fields (particularly business and finance), it’s common to make a quite different risk-uncertainty distinction, like the one made in the quote at the beginning of this post. This different risk-uncertainty distinction (which is the one this post will focus on) is <em>not</em> about whether we’re talking about the possibility of something negative.</p>
<p>Instead, <em>this</em> distinction centres on something like whether we can “have”, “know”, “express”, “estimate”, or “quantify” the probabilities of interest (or perhaps, more specifically, “believable”, “justifiable”, or “precise” probabilities). If we can, we’re facing <em>risk</em> (even if the potential outcomes are all positive). If we can’t, we’re facing <em>uncertainty</em> (or <em>Knightian uncertainty</em>).<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-Yp4Sg8zGrMjtgJm9u-2"" id=""fnref-Yp4Sg8zGrMjtgJm9u-2"">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href=""https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7856/76681b25175e53685d1a9277b20a0656b93b.pdf"">Here’s</a> one way of explaining this risk-uncertainty distinction:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to a seminal classification by Knight (1921), three types of uncertainty can be distinguished. In some situations, we can calculate the objective probabilities of events a priori, for instance, the chances of a (fair) die showing a six. In other cases, probabilities can be estimated statistically from data, for instance, the chances of being wrongly diagnosed [with] cancer when participating in regular screenings. Both cases are referred to as situations of <strong><em>risk</em></strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Finally, there are situations with so many unique features that they can hardly be grouped with similar cases, such as the danger resulting from a new type of virus, or the consequences of military intervention in conflict areas. These represent cases of <strong>(Knightian) uncertainty</strong> where no data are available to estimate objective probabilities. While we may rely on our subjective estimates under such conditions, no objective basis exists by which to judge them (e.g., LeRoy &amp; Singell, 1987). However, even when information is in principle attainable and chances could be estimated, an individual agent or agency may still lack the time or resources to do so—and thus face a situation of uncertainty. (bolding and line break added)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href=""https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.02194/full"">Here’s</a> another similar explanation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the case of risk, the outcome is unknown, but the probability distribution governing that outcome is known. Uncertainty, on the other hand, is characterised by both an unknown outcome and an unknown probability distribution. For risk, these chances are taken to be objective, whereas for uncertainty, they are subjective.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Consider betting with a friend by rolling a die. If one rolls at least a four, one wins 30 Euros [...]. If one rolls lower, one loses. If the die is unbiased, one’s decision to accept the bet is taken with the knowledge that one has a 50 per cent chance of winning and losing. This situation is characterised by risk. However, if the die has an unknown bias, the situation is characterised by uncertainty.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The latter applies to all situations in which one knows that there is a chance of winning and losing but has no information on the exact distribution of these chances. (line break added)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And here’s another explanation from <a href=""https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11948-017-9919-x"">Roser</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a locus classicus, Luce and Raiffa (1957, p. 13) distinguish risk and uncertainty according to whether probabilities are known or completely unknown or not even meaningful.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>Does the distinction make sense?</h1>
<p>What does it mean for a probability to be “known”? What does it mean for a probability to be “completely unknown”, or “not even meaningful”? <strong>Can we find a clear, sharp way of separating all probabilities into just the two categories of (a) those we can “know” and (b) those which must remain “completely unknown”?</strong></p>
<p>As far as I can tell, the answer to that last question has to be “No.” This is essentially based on the following premises:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>P1: The answer being “Yes” would require it being the case that:</p>
<ul>
<li>P1a) There are some probabilities that we can <em>absolutely certainly know</em>, and/or</li>
<li>P1b) There are some probabilities that we can have <em>absolutely no knowledge about</em> (and for which we can’t even use something like an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prior_probability#Uninformative_priors"">uninformative prior</a>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>P2: P1a is false, because we can never validly be (or at least never <em>should</em> be) <em><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ooypcn7qFzsMcy53R/infinite-certainty"">absolutely certain</a></em> of anything.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>P3: P1b is false, because we essentially always have at least <em>some</em>, <em>incredibly flimsy</em> basis for coming to a probability estimate for something, or, failing that, can use some type of uninformative prior. (I’m less confident in this premise than in the previous ones, and also less sure how to phrase what I mean.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I can’t offer a proof of these premises (note: this doesn’t mean that a proof is impossible, just that I don’t know of one). Instead, what I’ll do below is try to illustrate why I believe those premises by:</p>
<ul>
<li>returning to examples that one of the authors quoted previously gave <em>specifically for the purpose of highlighting the claimed distinction between risk and uncertainty</em></li>
<li>arguing that <em>these examples</em> do not in fact show cases in which we can absolutely certainly know some probabilities and have absolutely no knowledge about others.</li>
</ul>
<p>I claim that, in the absence of an alternative good example that <em>does</em> demonstrate P1a or P1b, this provides fairly strong evidence for P2 and P3, at least.</p>
<h2>Certain knowledge of a probability?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In some situations, we can calculate the objective probabilities of events a priori, for instance, the chances of a (fair) die showing a six. In other cases, probabilities can be estimated statistically from data, for instance, the chances of being wrongly diagnosed [with] cancer when participating in regular screenings. Both cases are referred to as situations of <em>risk</em>. (<a href=""https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7856/76681b25175e53685d1a9277b20a0656b93b.pdf"">source</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But how do we actually know that that’s a fair die? What if someone swapped it out at the last minute? And, even if it is what we’d typically call a “fair die”, how do we know that that means the odds it’ll show a six are ⅙? What if it’s become slightly eroded - entirely accidentally - such that it has a <em>slightly</em> higher chance of showing a six than showing another number? What if the person <em>throwing</em> the die knows how to throw it such as to increase or decrease the odds it’ll land on six?</p>
<p>Or as Yudkowsky’s flair for the dramatic <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/f6ZLxEWaankRZ2Crv/probability-is-in-the-mind"">puts it</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The die might land on its edge; or get struck by a meteor; or the Dark Lords of the Matrix might reach in and write “37” on one side.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>None of this stops me from happily believing that the odds are ⅙ that a die I have “very strong reason to believe” is “fair” will show a six. Nor will it stop me making bets on that basis. But it seems to me to highlight that there’s at least <em>some</em> doubt about what probability I should assign, and thus that this example doesn’t demonstrate P1a (i.e., doesn’t demonstrate that there are any probabilities I should be <em>absolutely certain</em> about).</p>
<p>Similar arguments could be run against the idea that the chances of being wrongly diagnosed with cancer can be absolutely, certainly known. (On top of the obvious possibilities like methodological errors in relevant studies, it’s also possible that the person’s very <em>concept</em> of cancer itself doesn’t line up well with reality or with the concept used by the relevant studies.)</p>
<h2>Zero knowledge of a probability?</h2>
<p>But might P1b be true - might there be probabilities we can have <em>absolutely no knowledge about</em> (and for which we can’t even use something like an uninformative prior)? I don’t believe I’ve ever encountered an example of such a probability. To return to the example given earlier:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>there are situations with so many unique features that they can hardly be grouped with similar cases, such as the danger resulting from a new type of virus, or the consequences of military intervention in conflict areas. These represent cases of (Knightian) uncertainty where no data are available to estimate objective probabilities. While we may rely on our subjective estimates under such conditions, no objective basis exists by which to judge them (e.g., LeRoy &amp; Singell, 1987). (<a href=""https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7856/76681b25175e53685d1a9277b20a0656b93b.pdf"">source</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But are those situations really <em>absolutely unique</em>? Do we really have <em>no (relevant) data</em> available? What about previous viruses? What about previous military interventions? Of course situations may be <em>very, very different</em> in the case at hand, and that data may be of <em>very little</em> relevance, barely narrow things down at all, and still leave your guesses as very likely to be quite inaccurate. But isn’t it <em>something</em>?</p>
<p>To see that <em>some</em> data we have <em>is at least slightly relevant</em>, consider your reaction if I told you that the number of deaths from this new virus or new military intervention (which will occur sometime in the next 20 years) would be somewhere between 0 and 1 million, rather than somewhere between 1 trillion and 1 trillion &amp; 1 million (i.e., more than the entire population of Earth). You’d be confident saying which of those is more likely, wouldn’t you?</p>
<p>And I think we’d both agree that that’s not just overconfidence - you <em>do</em> have legitimate reasons for your judgements there.</p>
<p>In fact, <a href=""https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/philip-tetlock-forecasting-research/"">Tetlock’s</a> work has <em>empirically</em> shown that it <em>is</em> possible to reliably do better than chance (and better than just “between 0 and 1 million”) in predicting events very much like those, at least over spans of a few years.<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-Yp4Sg8zGrMjtgJm9u-3"" id=""fnref-Yp4Sg8zGrMjtgJm9u-3"">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>As with my rejection of P1a, what I’ve said is merely <em>suggestive</em> of P1b’s falsity - it’s still possible that there are <em>some</em> probabilities we can have <em>absolutely</em> <em>no knowledge of</em>. But I’ve seen various claimed examples of situations of (Knightian) uncertainty, and none have seemed to be ones in which we can have <em>absolutely no knowledge</em> of the probability. (Further discussion <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NpkDPQjN5ceF75QaP/can-we-always-assign-probabilities"">here</a>.) And I <em>suspect</em>, though here I’m quite unsure, that if there <em>was</em> a good example, it’d still be possible to use something like an uninformative prior to deal with it, in the absence of anything better.</p>
<p>Altogether, I find myself fairly confident that Premises 1-3, or statements sufficiently like them, are true, and thus that <strong>it does not make sense to speak of an absolute, binary distinction between “risk” and “uncertainty”</strong>.</p>
<p>But why does that matter anyway? The next section discusses some decision-making procedures that people have proposed based on the idea that there is a risk-uncertainty distinction, and why these procedures seem strange and suboptimal.</p>
<h1>Decision-making given this distinction</h1>
<p><strong>Many people argue that that maximising expected utility, or even just using <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value"">expected value</a> reasoning or explicit probabilities (EP) at all, is impossible or inappropriate when facing (Knightian) uncertainty rather than risk</strong>.<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-Yp4Sg8zGrMjtgJm9u-4"" id=""fnref-Yp4Sg8zGrMjtgJm9u-4"">[4]</a></sup><sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-Yp4Sg8zGrMjtgJm9u-5"" id=""fnref-Yp4Sg8zGrMjtgJm9u-5"">[5]</a></sup> As <a href=""https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11948-017-9919-x"">Roser</a> writes: “According to a popular view, then, how we ought to make policy decisions depends crucially on whether we have probabilities.” Roser goes on to discuss three existing proposals for alternatives to standard usage of EPs when in situations of “uncertainty”, and why he rejects them; this is what I turn to now.</p>
<h2>Principle of indifference</h2>
<p>Roser:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The Principle of Indifference</em> The first principle (also called the Principle of Insufficient Reason) suggests that if we have no probabilities, we ought to assign equal probabilities to all possible outcomes. We can then decide on the basis of these fabricated probabilities. Many of us tacitly and informally use this principle in everyday life. But it is also explicitly relied upon in the scientific literature. For example, in an article published in <em>Science</em>, Wigley and Raper (2001, p. 452) assume various emission scenarios to be equally likely on account of the fact that the IPCC’s third assessment report refused to make probability statements in this respect.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>However, there is a widely acknowledged problem with the Principle of Indifference: there is often no natural way to individuate the consequences which one should treat as equally probable. [See Roser's paper for details.]</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Maximin</h2>
<p>Roser:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Maximin</em> While the first strategy for decision-making without probabilities suggests making up probabilities, the second and most prominent strategy goes a different way. The Maximin Principle only characterizes consequences of policies as possible or impossible rather than as more or less probable. It proposes to rank policies by their worst possible consequence and to choose the policy with the least bad worst consequence.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The problem with Maximin lies in determining the worst <em>possible</em> consequence. There are various notions of possibility such as epistemic, logical, physical, or metaphysical possibility. According to any of these, the worst possible consequence of <em>any</em> climate policy currently on the table would seem to include the extinction of humanity or even worse catastrophes. This is hardly helpful for choosing among them.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The literature therefore suggests that we should not rely on a literal understanding of ‘‘possible’’ when espousing Maximin [cf. for example Gardiner (2006, p. 51) or Resnik (2003, pp. 336–337)]. Rather, if Maximin is to convince at all, the worst possible consequence must be understood as, say, the worst ‘‘realistic’’ consequence or the worst ‘‘plausible’’ consequence [which in turn could for example translate into us understanding the mechanism by which it could occur (cf. Shue 2010, p. 148)]. However, this brings up a problem. What does it mean for a consequence to be realistic? A consequence must count as realistic if the available evidence gives it at least some minimal support. Judging a consequence to have a certain minimal level of evidential support, however, precisely means judging it to have a certain minimal probability. Thus, realism judgements are nothing but probability judgements. ‘‘Realistic’’ is just another word for ‘‘not highly improbable’’.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This undermines the plausibility of Maximin as a decision-principle in the absence of probabilities, as it implies an availability of probabilities. If our evidence is such as to allow for a judgement about the realistic range of consequences, this same evidence surely allows for at least some probability judgements within and beyond that range. Maximin, however, suggests to arbitrarily limit our attention to the probability judgements needed for delineating the realistic range and not to make use of any probabilities within or beyond that range.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See Roser’s paper for what I see as a convincing example of the sort of problems maximin can lead to. Further discussion of why maximin, or something quite similar, seems a flawed approach can be found in <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/iDYaCJ3o3Q7ypriTF/knightian-uncertainty-and-ambiguity-aversion-motivation"">this</a> <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/bukfeDZPHDHYRyBLB/knightian-uncertainty-in-a-bayesian-framework"">series</a> <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/GBpdBPS8CqcC425tq/knightian-uncertainty-bayesian-agents-and-the-mmeu-rule"">of</a> <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/SEov2u5Y7mJTPaTLK/knightian-uncertainty-a-rejection-of-the-mmeu-rule"">posts</a> by Soares.<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-Yp4Sg8zGrMjtgJm9u-6"" id=""fnref-Yp4Sg8zGrMjtgJm9u-6"">[6]</a></sup></p>
<h2>Avoiding a lack of probabilities</h2>
<p>Roser:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Avoiding a Lack of Probabilities</em> A third option for choosing policies in the absence of probabilities consists in limiting the menu to those options which allow for probability assignments. [...] This line of thinking is familiar from Ellsberg (1961). Consider the following scenario:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Scenario A: You must choose between drawing a lottery ticket (i) from an urn with 50% winning tickets or (ii) from an urn with an unknown proportion of winning and losing tickets.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In this scenario many would choose from the first urn. This is hardly irrational. However, assume a modified scenario:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Scenario B: You must choose between drawing a lottery ticket (i) from an urn with 1% winning tickets or (ii) from an urn with an unknown proportion of winning and losing tickets.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In that case, it is less clear what choice would be rational. The Principle of Avoiding a Lack of Probabilities would still recommend drawing a ticket from the first urn. But we might instinctively resist this (probably on the basis of an unjustified application of the Principle of Indifference). The problem is that it seems hopeless to justify our intuitive choices in either scenario A or B. Even though we are drawn to decide in line with the Principle of Avoiding a Lack of Probabilities in some cases (such as scenario A), a reason to support this intuition is not forthcoming.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Further discussion of situations like Scenarios A and B, and of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambiguity_aversion"">ambiguity aversion</a> involved, can be found in the abovementioned series of posts from Soares.</p>
<p>A quote from <a href=""http://www.global-catastrophic-risks.com/docs/Chap01.pdf"">Bostrom and Ćirković</a> may further highlight the lack of rationale for, and potential scale of harms from, following the principle of Avoiding a Lack of Probabilities:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although more rigorous methods are to be preferred whenever they are available and applicable, it would be misplaced scientism to confine attention to those risks that are amenable to hard approaches. Such a strategy would lead to many risks being ignored, including many of the largest risks confronting humanity. It would also create a false dichotomy between two types of risks – the ‘scientific’ ones and the ‘speculative’ ones – where, in reality, there is a continuum of analytic tractability.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Do we have a choice?</h2>
<p>As Roser notes, despite all these issues, if there <em>was</em> an absolute, binary risk-uncertainty distinction, it might be preferable - or necessary - to use one of these three principles rather than a standard usage of EPs. However, as discussed above, it seems that there <em>isn’t</em> such a distinction. Thus, we <em>do</em> have a choice in the matter.</p>
<p>So it seems that, at least in the case of an ideal agent, it would be best to use whatever probabilities we do have, even if they’re incredibly poorly grounded, as they’d still be better than nothing. Roser writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is difficult to see how foregoing whatever epistemic access to the features of the options at stake we have could lead to better policy decisions than making use of it. This would be comparable to a visually impaired pilot closing her eyes on account of the impairment rather than using whatever impressions she can glean from her limited eyesight. Discarding low-credentials-probabilities amounts to wasting information. [See <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/gcEayv6HtBogfov2n/michaela-s-shortform?commentId=otZLATzjTfMRuE9JA"">here</a> for what Roser means by “low-credentials-probabilities”.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href=""https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/KfqFLDkoccf8NQsQe/potential-downsides-of-using-explicit-probabilities"">My next post</a> will discuss the more complicated matter of to what extent that argument applies in practice, for actual humans, given issues like the time costs involved in using EPs and tendencies towards overconfidence and anchoring.</p>
<h1>Unknown unknowns</h1>
<p><a href=""https://www.givewell.org/modeling-extreme-model-uncertainty#Motivating_challenge_risk_vs_uncertainty"">Here’s</a> one last statement of the risk-uncertainty distinction (this one from Holden Karnofsky):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>""Risk"" refers to the probabilities seen in well-understood and robust models, [...] such that one can be confident in what would happen over a large number of trials but not over a small number. ""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knightian_uncertainty"">Uncertainty</a>"" refers to fuzzy, poorly modeled lack of understanding (or to ""missing pieces of one's model"")[.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This quote makes more explicit the idea that (Knightian) uncertainty could be understood as including <em>unknown unknowns</em> (“missing pieces of one’s model”), rather than just “unknown” probabilities for the things one <em>is</em> modelling (which can be considered “<em>known</em> unknowns”). It could also be understood as including the related idea of “<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory"">black swans</a>”.</p>
<p>These concepts are sometimes ignored, sometimes implicit, and sometimes explicit in discussions of a risk-uncertainty distinction. Here I’ll explain how I think they fit into the picture. This is the section of this post where I’m least confident about both how true my beliefs are and how clearly I explain those beliefs.</p>
<p>I think unknown unknowns that <em>influence</em> the likelihood of whatever proposition we’re trying to work out the probability of are a key and common reason why the probability estimate we arrive at may be quite poorly grounded, flimsy, untrustworthy, etc. I think they’re also a key and common reason why the situation may <em>look</em> to some like a situation of Knightian uncertainty. But this doesn’t require fundamentally different approaches to creating or interpreting of one’s probability estimates. <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/bukfeDZPHDHYRyBLB/knightian-uncertainty-in-a-bayesian-framework"">Soares</a> gives a useful example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Consider the event ""there is a cure for Alzheimer's disease 70 years from now"".</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As an aspiring Bayesian, I can assign a credence to this event. But as a denizen in a world of chaos, I can <em>also</em> expect black swan events. Dealing with the black swans doesn't require any new type of probability, though: I can account for it <em>within</em> the Bayesian framework.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Soares notes that black swans could include possibilities <em>like</em> “Within 70 years, human civilization will have collapsed”, but that obviously that particular example is no longer a black swan for <em>us</em>, as we’re now considering it. The black swans are those events we haven’t even thought of. He goes on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don't know <em>where</em> to expect black swans, but I can ask questions like ""how will the average black swan affect Alzheimer's cures?"". If I expect that most black swans will make Alzheimer's cures easier to achieve, then I adjust my credence upwards. If I expect the opposite, then I adjust my credence downwards.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And if I expect that I have absolutely no idea what the black swans will look like but <em>also</em> have no reason to believe black swans will make this event any more or less likely, then even though I won't adjust my credence further, I can still <em>increase the variance of my distribution over my future credence for this event</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In other words, even if my <em>current</em> credence is 50% I can still expect that in 35 years (after encountering a black swan or two) my credence will be very different. This has the effect of making me act uncertain about my current credence, allowing me to say ""my credence for this is 50%"" without much confidence. So long as I can't predict the direction of the update, this is consistent Bayesian reasoning.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As a bounded Bayesian, I have all the <em>behaviors</em> recommended by those advocating Knightian uncertainty. I put high value on increasing my hypothesis space, and I often expect that a hypothesis will come out of left field and throw off my predictions. I'm happy to increase my error bars, and I often expect my credences to vary wildly over time. But I do all of this <em>within a Bayesian framework</em>, with no need for exotic ""immeasurable"" uncertainty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But what if the unknown unknown doesn’t just <em>influence</em> what we’re trying to get a probability estimate for, but instead it <em>is</em> what we’re trying to get a probability estimate for? Soares discusses this too:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>we are bounded reasoners, and we usually can't consider all available hypotheses. We can't expect to generate even the top ten most likely hypotheses, no matter how long we have to brainstorm. [...]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This phenomena is worrisome when attempting to predict the future, but we don't need a new kind of uncertainty to deal with the failure mode. In fact, this failure mode is nothing but a description of one of the limitations of a bounded Bayesian reasoner.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Bounded Bayesian reasoners <em>should</em> expect that they don't have access to the full hypothesis space. Bounded Bayesian reasoners can expect that their first-order predictions are incorrect due to a want of the right hypothesis, and thus place high credence on ""something I haven't thought of"", and place high value on new information or other actions that expand their hypothesis space.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That argument seems fairly sound to me. But parts of MIRI’s more recent writings on <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/Rm6oQRJJmhGCcLvxh/p/i3BTagvt3HbPMx6PN"">embedded agents</a> being smaller than their world models have seemed to me to indicate that Soares' suggestions may be insufficient. But even if that’s the case, I think that's a separate problem, rather than something that reveals that there's a binary risk-uncertainty distinction. Essentially, I think it'd only show that one can't have a probability estimate for something one hasn't thought of, not that there are some propositions or evidence bases that, by their nature, <em>fundamentally allow</em> no probability estimates (even when one is looking at the proposition and trying to come up with an estimate).</p>
<p>(But again, I’m less sure of both my thinking and explanation on this, and <em>think</em> it’s somewhat tangential to the risk-uncertainty distinction, so I’ll leave that there.)</p>
<h1>Closing remarks</h1>
<p>In this post, I’ve:</p>
<ul>
<li>outlined what the risk-uncertainty distinction is <em>meant</em> to mean</li>
<li>argued that no absolute, binary risk-uncertainty distinction exists</li>
<li>argued that imagining that there <em>is</em> such a distinction can lead to strange and suboptimal decision-making procedures</li>
</ul>
<p>But, <em>practically speaking</em>, <em>for humans</em>, could there be benefits to acting <em>as if</em> one believes there is such a distinction? I’ll cover this question in <a href=""https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/KfqFLDkoccf8NQsQe/potential-downsides-of-using-explicit-probabilities"">my next post</a> (ultimately arguing that the answer is probably “No”).</p>

<li id=""fn-Yp4Sg8zGrMjtgJm9u-2"" class=""footnote-item""><p>It seems unfortunate that this distinction uses familiar words in a way that’s very different from their familiar usage. As <a href=""https://medium.com/guesstimate-blog/the-confusion-of-risk-vs-uncertainty-1c6cd512aa69"">Gooen</a> writes, after introducing these less typical meanings of <em>risk</em> and <em>uncertainty</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Disagreeing with these definitions are common dictionaries and large parts of science and mathematics. In the Merriam-Webster dictionary, every definition of ‘risk’ is explicitly about possible negative events, not about general things with probability distributions. (<a href=""https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/risk"">https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/risk</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There is even a science explicitly called “<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_quantification"">uncertainty quantification</a>”, but none explicitly called “risk quantification”.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This is obviously something of a mess. Some business people get confused with mathematical quantifications of uncertainty, but other people would be confused by quantifications of socially positive “risks”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href=""https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11948-017-9919-x"">Roser</a> further emphasises similar points:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not only in the past, but also today there is no universally accepted distinction between risk and uncertainty based on whether we have probabilities or not. This holds, of course, for everyday discourse which does not adhere to the technical distinction. But even in scientific and philosophical contexts, only some authors subscribe to the convention to use the terms risk and uncertainty in this specific way. For example, while the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (2014, p. 155) draws a distinction between risk and uncertainty, it is completely different from the distinction at stake here. For instance, the IPCC takes probability density functions to be a common tool for characterizing uncertainty. One of the most famous microeconomics textbooks discusses decisions on the basis of probabilities under the heading of ‘‘Choice under Uncertainty’’ (Mas-Colell et al. 1995, ch. 6). More generally, there has been a long stream of economists who have dismissed the distinction and labelled it ‘‘sterile’’ or not ‘‘valid’’ (Hirshleifer and Riley 1992, p. 10; Friedman 1976, p. 282).</p>

I mean, you take that objection, which you hear repeatedly from extremely smart people that these events are unique and you can’t put probabilities on them, you take that objection and you say, “Okay, let’s take all the events that the smart people say are unique and let’s put them in a set and let’s call that set allegedly unique events. Now let’s see if people can make forecasts within that set of allegedly unique events and if they can, if they can make meaningful probability judgments of these allegedly unique events, maybe the allegedly unique events aren’t so unique after all, maybe there is some recurrence component.” And that is indeed the finding that when you take the set of allegedly unique events, hundreds of allegedly unique events, you find that the best forecasters make pretty well calibrated forecasts fairly reliably over time and don’t regress too much toward the mean.” <a href=""#fnref-Yp4Sg8zGrMjtgJm9u-3"" class=""footnote-backref"">↩︎</a></p>

<p>while I believe that we always have probabilities, this paper refrains from taking a stance on how we ought to decide on the basis of these probabilities.

The two issues are often not kept separate: the camp that is in favour of relying on probabilities is often associated with processing them in line with expected utility theory. I myself am in favour of relying on probabilities but I reject expected utility theory (and related stances such as cost-benefit analysis), at least if it comes as a formal way of spelling out a maximizing consequentialist moral stance which does not properly incorporate rights.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By the same token, the question of whether there’s a binary risk-uncertainty distinction is relevant even if one rejects maximisation or expected utility, as Roser also notes: “A lack of probabilities is not only a challenge for expected utility theory—which is known for its need for probabilities—but for all practical reasoning.” <a href=""#fnref-Yp4Sg8zGrMjtgJm9u-4"" class=""footnote-backref"">↩︎</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In section 2.2, I reject what I take to be a naïve but tempting response [to the problem of cluelessness]. On this view, we needn’t worry about our ignorance of the indirect effects of our actions, because ignorance of this kind is compatible with expected utility maximization. This underestimates the depth of the problem. Using the jargon proposed by Knight (1921), I suggest that we are dealing not with <em>risk</em>, but <em>uncertainty</em>: ignorance of a kind so deep that our evidence does not warrant assigning precise probabilities to all relevant contingencies. Under Knightian uncertainty, the doxastic attitudes of an agent who proportions her beliefs to the evidence cannot be represented by a unique probability function relative to which an expected utility for each act may be defined.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, it seems to me that the whole idea of cluelessness is premised on the idea of an absolute, binary risk-uncertainty distinction, or on something that’s very much like that distinction and that suffers from the same problems as that distinction does. I therefore hope to later write a post attempting to “<a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Mc6QcrsbH5NRXbCRX/dissolving-the-question"">dissolve</a>” the problem of cluelessness, using arguments quite similar to the above.

<p>When asked how long something will take, you have hidden ambiguity in the question and multiple sources of error. Here we will attempt to clarify both and start to address some of these issues.</p>
<h2>What is the question?</h2>
<p>Let's start with the ambiguity of the question. Lets ignore ambiguity over the definition of 'finished' and any errors in your estimation for now. Lets also assume that you already have a prioritised list of projects/work-packages, some of which will be in-progress, some wont have been started yet (I will take the terminology from SCRUM and call this the 'backlog' but it can apply to anything, not just projects as we traditionally think of them). Here are a few things that I think people actually mean when that ask ""how long will this [project] take?"":</p>
<ol>
<li>If you started this now and worked on nothing else (during your usual work hours) when would this task be completed?</li>
<li>If you started this project now and worked on no other projects (during your usual work hours), but still had to deal with the usual non-development work (such as meetings, firefighting and emails) when would this task be completed?</li>
<li>If you worked on this project as the absolute highest priority work. How many hours would you have spent on this project by the time it is finished?</li>
<li>Given that there are other projects that are in progress or even higher priority than this, <em>and</em> that some of your time is spent in non-development work. When will this project be finished?</li>
<li>As with 4 but realising that you are likely to add other work into the backlog, some of which will be higher priority than the project in discussion.</li>
</ol>
<p>There is an important subtlety to the phrasing of these questions which greatly changes their answers. This is not a problem if the questioner and the estimator agree on the definition but if you wanted an answer to variant 5 but got the answer to variant 1 then there is a problem.<br>
Lets go through an example to show how these variants differ and which is the best version in different scenarios.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p><em>A customer requested a feature to be added to some software and that you are responsible for the team that is developing the software.</em></p>
<p>To work out where you should add it to the backlog (i.e. it's priority compared to other things your team could work on) you want to know the ""size"" of the work, in this case you do not care whether you team has lots of meeting on at the moment or the priority of other projects - thus variant 3 is the best version in this case. Let's say that you have a perfectly accurate and precise predicting machine that says this is 2-hours (I want to revisit this simplification in another post). But it's important to say that number along with the understanding that you cannot actually get the work done in that time. Your team will have non-development work to do, they will have meetings, and need breaks, if you know they have to deal with ""firefighting"" of emergencies then this needs to be factored in too. You go back to your predicting machine and ask it: what is the current fraction of time my team can focus on development work, it replies with 50%.<br>
Unfortunately the answer to variant-2 is not ""in 4 hours time"" (2h / 50%) because there will be times when you cannot progress on the project because you are waiting on something (most commonly other people). Lets say for this project you need sign-off from the marketing department roughly half-way through the work (other common reasons might be waiting for access, for information, for the results of other people's work, etc). So we go back to our predicting machine and it says ""the reply from marketing will take 3h, there will be no other delays"". This give us our answer to variant-2: ""the work can be done in 8 hours, but 3 of those hours we will be waiting on others, and 2 of those will be on unrelated non-development work"". Note that by being specific when answering these questions you reduce confusion.<br>
This still doesn't help our customer, because we are unlikely to start the work right away. We will probably finish off the work we are on, possibly implement other higher-priority work and then start. We go back to our prediction machine which says ""the projects that are in-progress or higher priority than this one (from the backlog) will be complete in 4 days time"". We add that to the 8h for the project in question and get the answer to variant-4 ""assuming the backlog doesn't change the project will be complete in 5 days"".
But we know that isn't a realistic assumption, just like this project, we regular add new projects to the backlog and that shifts the priorities and thus the timescales for each item to be complete. We go back to our prediction machine it says ""before you get started on the project in question you will add a further 6 days of development work that is higher priority than the project in question"". So you have to add this extra 6 days to the 5 days, take into account any weekends and holidays and give the final answer to variant-5, the one the customer actually cares about: ""it will be 11 working days to before you can use this feature"".<br>
So we have gone from a piece of work that will only take 2-hours to one that will not be ready for 11 working days. This is the scale of the ambiguity.</p>
<p>These figures are not unrealistic either - though I would be working hard as a team lead to increase the 50% development work figure and reduce or eliminate the 3h wait for marketing sign-off.</p>
<h2>What is 'done'/'complete'?</h2>
<p>Lets add one piece of complexity back in. What do you mean when you say done? Sticking with the example of a piece of software, here are a few possible parts to what you might mean by done, but there are more, and many of those have their own ambiguity:</p>
<ol>
<li>basic functionality works on the machine of one developer: ""it's working for me""</li>
<li>thoroughly tested</li>
<li>thoroughly documented</li>
<li>an automatic test suite written that covers every line changed</li>
<li>deployed so a (/every) customer can use the feature</li>
</ol>
<p>Again, there might be a doubling or more of workload between ""working on my machine"" to deployed and documented ready for customers to use.<br>
The only point I will make on this is to recognise the ambiguity and address it upfront. But unlike the last section the definitions will depend a lot on the area you are working in.</p>
<h2>Conclusion and Recommendations</h2>
<p>I will leave the advice on how to improve estimation for another time (please let me know if you are interested in this) but there are a few points to take away. Firstly ""how long will this take?"" or ""when can you get this done by?"" is a tricky question even if you are a well calibrated (accurate) and precise estimator. It's best to give your answer, not just in hours but as a longer sentence, ""it's only 2h work but we wont be done for 11 days"" or more verbosely ""the work can be done in 8 hours, but 3 of those hours we will be waiting on others, and 2 of those will be on unrelated non-development work. We probably wont start it for another 10 working days though"".</p>

Volta’s hypothesis was that the electrical charge was instead created by Galvani’s use of different metals to mount and probe the frog leg, and further that certain metals were naturally disposed to pass an electric charge given the presence of a conductor.</p><p>To test his hypothesis, Volta needed some way to detect the presence of an electric charge. In the days before the invention of precise instruments for measuring electricity, this was no small challenge. Others had used the creation of visible sparks or the physical sensation of getting an electric shock as a way of detecting electricity, but these effects tended to require a strong current and Volta suspected that the current involved in the frog leg experiment was relatively small.</p><p>He needed a more sensitive instrument. So, he used his tongue.</p><p>He reasoned that if a frog leg would conduct electricity, his tongue probably would too. And, Volta knew from previous experiments that an electric charge applied to the tongue could create a bitter sensation. This let him conduct an experiment: he touched either side of his tongue with combinations of metals and used the presence or absence of the bitter sensation to detect an electrical charge. He found that some combinations of metals did cause the bitter sensation, leading him to conclude that it was in fact the metals that passed a current through his tongue, rather than his tongue generating its own “animal electricity” (Cajavilca, Varon, and Sternbach 2009, 162; Shock and Awe: The Story of Electricity 2011).</p><p>Subsequent investigations led Volta to make further breakthroughs in understanding the ability of metals to transmit an electric charge. He eventually discovered that he could generate a strong and consistent electrical charge by stacking zinc and copper on top of one another in an alternating pattern with brine-soaked cloth or cardboard in between.</p><p>Volta’s invention was dubbed the Voltaic pile, and was the precursor to the modern battery.</p><figure><img src=""https://miro.medium.com/max/858/1*Jh-3swfS4LBsNVVOEMxozg.jpeg""></figure><p>Figure 2: Volta’s experiment and the Voltaic Pile</p><p>The debate between Galvani and Volta over animal electricity and related topics would result not only in the Voltaic pile, but also in the early development of the fields of electrophysiology, electromagnetism, and electrochemistry (Cajavilca, Varon, and Sternbach 2009, 159).</p><p>While the two had deep theoretical disagreements, Galvani’s creative experiments identified a phenomenon — frogs twitching when touching two pieces of metal — which Volta was able to study with a unique method of his own, using his tongue instead of a frog. Galvani’s theory of animal electricity was wrong, but his work enabled further research that led to the creation of the voltaic pile and the foundations of our modern understanding of electricity.</p><p>Volta and Galvani both had to develop many of their own theories in the absence of an accepted paradigm for electricity, and both had to design their own experimental tools and methods. The trajectory of their respective research programs, and of their research efforts combined, would have been hard to predict in advance. They tried anyway, and their work helped turn the study of electrical phenomenon into a fully developed scientific discipline.</p><h2><strong>Galileo and the Development of Telescopic Astronomy</strong></h2><p>The history of science includes a number of cases of scientific progress that share some of the notable features of Galvani and Volta’s research. Another example is the story of Galileo and the early development of telescopic astronomy.</p><p>Galileo Galilei pioneered the use of the telescope to observe celestial objects. He observed Jupiter’s moons, the phases of Venus, Saturn, the existence of sunspots and more. Initially, though, Galileo had trouble convincing others of the reliability and usefulness of the telescope. When Galileo visited Bologna in 1610 to demonstrate his telescope:</p><blockquote><p><i>In the presence of a number of learned men, Galileo showed his telescope and let others observe earthly and celestial things through it. They agreed that for earthly objects the instruments performed as promised but that in the heavens it was not reliable. Although Galileo’s notes show that on the first night two and on the second night all four of the satellites were visible, none of the gentlemen present were able to see satellites around Jupiter. (Van Helden 1994, 11)</i></p></blockquote><p>The learned men were skeptical of Galileo’s device for understandable reasons. The optical principles behind the device were not well understood at the time and some of Galileo’s claims about the heavens contravened established wisdom on the topic. Furthermore, Galileo’s telescope was not a very powerful or easy-to-use instrument. His telescope was capable of no more than 20x magnification and a field of view of around 15 feet, whereas one can purchase a modern amateur telescope today for around 100 USD that is capable of 10 times greater magnification (200x) and a field of view 34 times larger (516 feet) (<a href=""https://telescopicwatch.com/galileo-telescope/"">Sky and Telescope 2017; Telescopic Watch 2019</a>).</p><p>To illustrate the difficulties this posed, compare the image of Ely Cathedral viewed with a modern telescope at the same zoom as Galileo’s telescope (20x) with the field of view available to modern telescopes (Figure 3, top picture), with the image of the same object at the same distance with a replica of one of Galileo’s telescopes (Figure 3, bottom picture).</p><figure><img src=""https://miro.medium.com/max/738/1*2jM_xpV_18zHyIfogyadPQ.jpeg""></figure><p>Figure 3: Top picture — modern telescope at 20x zoom; Bottom picture — replica of Galileo’s telescope, also at 20x zoom (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzXnnwxJmSg"">Astronomy and Nature TV 2010</a>)</p><p>The small circle in the middle of the bottom picture is the field of view available through the replica telescope. The light colored area shows the visible portion of the cathedral.</p><p>In addition to the small field of view, Galileo lacked modern equipment for mounting and stabilizing his telescope. This meant that even if Galileo could find the relevant astronomical object in the small field of view, ensuring that the telescope remained fixed on that object for repeated observations was a significant challenge.</p><p>Finally, even under optimal circumstances, it is not uncommon for a user of Galileo’s telescope to fail to see what they are meant to see. The instrument takes a certain amount of getting used to as the eye and brain become accustomed to interpreting the image and not everyone has sufficiently good eyesight to use the device properly (Van Helden 1994, 11). As one historian of science notes:</p><blockquote><p><i>On several occasions I have taken a group of my students to look for Jupiter’s satellites through a replica of one of Galileo’s telescopes — students who were convinced the moons were really there — and the results were always mixed. Some saw all that were visible, some saw one or two, and some saw none at all. No matter how public the occasion, the actual observing remains an individual and private act. (Van Helden 1994, 12)</i></p></blockquote><p>Indeed, the private nature of telescopic observations created difficulties in settling scientific disputes. For example, in 1643, Antonius Rheita published a book announcing the discovery of new satellites around Jupiter and Saturn. While others reported not seeing the satellites, Rheita claimed the satellites could only be seen with the new, more powerful telescope he had invented. All telescopes at the time were hand-made and thus differed in clarity and magnification, and so scientists could not simply use their own instruments to confirm or disconfirm each others’ claims as their failure to replicate results could be the consequence of inferior equipment. Scientists eventually reached agreement on this question in 1647, when Hevelius (who claimed to have built a still more powerful telescope), was able to convince scientists that the supposed satellites were actually fixed stars behind the planets (Van Helden 1994, 8–20).</p><p>The telescope was initially an unreliable, poorly understood tool. It did not produce directly shareable or replicable results and in practice often created scientific disputes that were difficult to resolve. Yet despite the challenges it posed, the telescope did sometimes allow early telescopic astronomers to make observations that were more detailed than those available to the naked eye. This modest improvement was enough to attract a small number of early scientists who began working with the device. Over time, they learned more about the optical principles involved, improved at grinding lenses for new telescopes, and developed more effective ways of communicating their findings to other astronomers and the public.</p><h2><strong>Black, Lavoisier, and the Chemical Revolution</strong></h2><p>In 1756, Joseph Black published his Experiments Upon Magnesia Alba in which he described experiments he performed on an unusual substance which he called “fixed air.” Black originally discovered the substance² through experiments on magnesia alba — now called magnesium carbonate — and chalk (calcium carbonate). Black observed that when magnesia alba was heated or combined with an acid it began to bubble and left behind a residue. Black was able to use an analytical balance that he invented to precisely weigh the residue and note that it lost a noticeable amount of weight. Black hypothesized that the bubbling and weight loss was caused by the liberation of a gas that had been “fixed” in the magnesia alba (hence the name, fixed air).</p><p>Black was curious about the properties of this fixed air and so began to devise ways to experiment with the substance.</p><p>He noticed that it had an unusual effect on fire, noting that:</p><blockquote><p><i>I mixed together some chalk and vitriolic acid. . . The strong effervescence produced an air or vapour, which, flowing out at the top of the glass, extinguished a candle that stood close to it; and a piece of burning paper immersed in it, was put out as effectually as if it had been dipped in water. (West 2014, L1059)</i></p></blockquote><p>This indicated that fixed air was not the same as atmospheric air. There were other unusual properties as well. He investigated the effect of fixed air on animals and found that it was remarkably toxic when inhaled — he noted that “sparrows died in it in ten or eleven seconds” (Robinson 1803).</p><p>The toxicity of fixed air when inhaled led Black to suspect that fixed air might be the air expelled as part of the respiration process itself. He designed several experiments to test this hypothesis. In one he blew bubbles into a solution of limewater (calcium hydroxide) and noted that a precipitate of chalk was leftover indicating that he had succeeded in fixing the air back into the chalk. He repeated this experiment on a larger scale by placing limewater soaked in rags in an air duct in the ceiling of a church and observing a chalk residue as the lime soaked up the fixed air from the congregation’s respiration (West 2014, L1059).</p><p>He made several other discoveries about the substance and explained various observed phenomena. For instance, there was an observed unusual effect at the Grotto del Cano in Italy, where animals that visited the Grotto died, but humans could visit unharmed. Black explained this phenomenon by proposing that fixed air was heavier than atmospheric air and thus sank closer to the ground, poisoning animals but not humans. He also discovered that fixed air was emitted during the fermentation process (West 2014, L1059).</p><p>We now know “fixed air” as carbon dioxide, and Black’s work isolating and describing the properties of carbon dioxide represented the first demonstration that gases can be weighable constituents of solid bodies, the first demonstration that gases are unique chemical substances and not atmospheric air in different states of purity, and the first demonstration that respiration involves the transformation of gases. In the 18 years after the publication of Black’s work all the respiratory gases were isolated and characterized with Henry Cavendish discovering hydrogen in 1766, Daniel Rutherford isolating nitrogen in 1772, and Joseph Priestly isolating oxygen in 1774 (West 2014, L1059).</p><p>Joseph Black’s work in isolating and describing carbon dioxide contributed significantly to scientific progress in chemistry. In much the same fashion as Galvani and Volta, Black discovered a new phenomenon and developed unusual and creative methods to study the phenomenon. In particular, his insight that carbon dioxide was connected to respiration allowed for rapid progress in isolating the other gases involved in respiration. As other scientists investigated new gases they attempted to explain them in terms of ultimately incorrect, yet sometimes useful theories. Indeed, even Black’s theory that the air was “fixed” in the solids is somewhat different than the modern understanding of the phenomenon. In modern nomenclature, Magnesia Alba is MgCO3, and by heating it MgCO3 becomes MgO + CO2. We might say that carbon dioxide can be liberated from Magnesia Alba but in modern terms, we probably wouldn’t describe carbon dioxide as being “fixed” in the Magnesia Alba. While Black’s theory of carbon dioxide may not match our modern understanding, he nevertheless contributed significantly to scientific progress by isolating and cleverly studying a new phenomenon.</p><p>As additional gases were isolated and described, there was considerable disagreement about what the gasses were and scientists advanced a number of competing theories to explain their properties. For example, Rutherford and Priestly’s discoveries were both explained in terms of the then popular phlogiston theory of combustion which posited that an element called phlogiston was released from materials as they combusted and combustion would continue until either all the phlogiston had been released or the air was saturated with phlogiston such that it could not contain more. On this theory nitrogen was labeled “phlogisticated air” and oxygen was labeled “dephlogisticated air.”³</p><p>The debate over the nature of these newly discovered airs culminated in the work of Antoine-Laurent de Lavoisier and what is often called the chemical revolution. Between 1775 and 1789, Lavoisier is credited with discovering the law of conservation of mass and a new theory of combustion, which explained combustion and acidic corrosion in terms of oxygen⁴ and eventually replaced the phlogiston theory. Lavoisier’s approach to chemistry built on Black’s approach through its focus on weight, but utilized much more sophisticated and elaborate equipment to investigate the properties of the newly discovered airs (West 2014, L1060).</p><h1><strong>Identifying a Phenomenon</strong></h1><p>The research efforts of Volta and Galvani, Galileo, and Black appear to have a number of attributes in common.</p><p>They feature a relative absence of established theories and well-understood instruments in the area of investigation, the appearance of strange or unexplained phenomena, and lack of theoretical and practical consensus among researchers. Progress seems to occur despite (and sometimes enabled by) flawed theories, individual researchers use imprecise measurement tools that are frequently new and difficult to share, and there exists a bi-directional cycle of improvement between increasingly sophisticated theories and increasingly precise measurement tools.</p><p>For example, consider Black’s study of fixed air. He began with an unexplained phenomenon: certain substances losing weight when heated. His approach to studying that phenomenon involved a wide range of methods, such as blowing bubbles into limewater and leaving limewater-soaked rags in the air duct of a church. This led to a larger study of new gases, where there were many theoretical disagreements between researchers, and where flawed theories (e.g., the theories of phlogisticated and dephlogisticated air) seemed to aid the process of discovery. Finally, improvements in measuring the weight of substances allowed for better theories and refinements to the researchers’ instruments.</p><p>These examples gesture at the potential existence of a recognizable cluster of discovery-related attributes (“Attribute Cluster 1”) that plausibly play an important role in scientific progress. This is striking, because this is different from another attribute cluster (“Attribute Cluster 2”) that is more familiar and more commonly referred to, that appears throughout the history of science. That second cluster includes large groups of scientists working together, a foundation of largely accepted theory, precise and well-understood instruments, researcher consensus on the quality of these instruments, and many small discoveries that tend to build iteratively on one-another and cohere with previous theory.</p><p>This raises a number of questions: Are the attributes in Attribute Cluster 1 actually present in cases described above? Do those attributes appear in a special set of cases in the history of science? More generally, is there a natural cluster of discovery-related attributes in the conceptual vicinity of Attribute Cluster 1 that appear in important cases of scientific discovery, like those described above? What can we learn from investigating the cases that are the most natural candidates for exemplifying attributes from Attribute Cluster 1? Is the distinction between Attribute Cluster 1 and Attribute Cluster 2 useful in the context of describing the progress of science?</p><p>The pattern suggested by the cases described above, and those like them, is noteworthy. If there is in fact a recognizable cluster of discovery-related attributes that plausibly play a role in scientific progress other than Attribute Cluster 2, this could be important for understanding when and how new fields make scientific progress. We believe this possibility is rendered at least somewhat plausible by the cases above and deserves further study.</p><h1><strong>Hypothesis</strong></h1><p>The cases of Volta and Galvani, Galileo, and Black illustrate a hypothesized pattern in the development of fields of science which we call “early stage science.”</p><p>We hypothesize that:</p><ol><li>Some scientific fields develop from initial investigations in nascent fields to highly functional knowledge acquisition programs.</li><li>The histories of the development of these highly functional knowledge acquisition programs are characterized by a similar, describable pattern.</li><li>As part of this pattern, the relevant scientific fields have different attributes at different points in their development. More specifically, earlier in the development of the relevant scientific fields, the fields have an attribute cluster in the conceptual vicinity of Attribute Cluster 1, as suggested by numerous examples. Some of those fields later have an attribute cluster in the conceptual vicinity of Attribute Cluster 2. The fact of these attribute clusters implies the existence of phases of scientific development.</li><li>These phases of scientific development arise from the facts about how people figure things out about the world. This includes how inference, experimentation, observation, theory development, tool development, and other aspects of how people can seek to understand the world around them lead researchers to be able to improve their understanding of a given phenomenon.</li><li>In accordance with this, researchers need to use different tools and practices depending on their starting state of knowledge. We expect to find that there is a coherent logic to the meta-practices that lead to the development and advancement of research programs under different starting conditions.</li><li>More specifically, a model of early stage scientific practice will explain how researchers overcome the difficulties that arise when attempting to gain knowledge when dealing with substantially unknown phenomena, poor tools, and so forth. When stated, this model will be both prima facie plausible and verifiable by checking against the research activities that led to important discoveries in practice.</li></ol><p>It is consistent with the above hypothesis that many of the attributes specifically identified in the historical cases above are not actually constitutive of early stage science, so long as conceptually similar attributes can be identified which are.</p><h1><strong>Methodology</strong></h1><p>The current methodology of our investigation primarily focuses on analyzing historical case studies of scientific discovery in new fields. In this section, we cover how we plan to select and analyze specific cases.</p><h2><strong>Selecting Cases</strong></h2><p>To select cases, we will attempt to identify functional modern and historical scientific research programs and identify the initial discoveries integral to their development. By starting with functional scientific research programs and working back, we are aiming to ensure that the cases of early stage research we study are success cases. The pattern that we hypothesize to exist is not meant to be a pattern that occurs in all early stage research, but rather effective early stage research. Since the effectiveness of early stage research can be difficult to assess, we believe the safest set of cases to examine are cases where the relevant field developed into a full-fledged functional research program.</p><p>To identify functional modern and historical scientific research programs, we will look for fields where there are large groups of researchers studying similar phenomena, using very similar methods, with a corpus of shared theory, and substantial predictive power. This is our initial hypothesis of signs that will enable us to identify a sufficient set of functional scientific research programs. If we encounter reasons to change our criteria, we will do so, especially if doing so will help us to better identify successful early stage research cases. It is open to us, for instance, that we would be better served by looking at Kuhnian paradigms or broad scientific consensus, rather than looking for the attributes above.</p><p>Once we identify functional scientific research programs and identify the initial discoveries integral to their development, we will then analyze how researchers made those discoveries.</p><p>For example, consider modern astronomy. As part of doing their research, large groups of modern astronomers use highly advanced telescopes and highly advanced analytical methods to find, see, and study intergalactic objects at an incredible degree of precision. Astronomers have a shared body of theory, make the same observations with different telescopes, and are able to predict with high precision what they and others will observe when they look through telescopes at different points in the sky. These attributes indicate that modern astronomy is plausibly a highly functional scientific research program.</p><p>Having selected astronomy as a plausible success case for scientific development, we can then investigate the beginnings of the field to find plausibly important and formative discoveries. In this case, Galileo and others’ work with early telescopes significantly changed how we both observe and think about objects in space. As a result, Galileo plausibly represents a case where successful early research methods might be visible and thus is fruitful to study.</p><h2><strong>Analyzing Cases</strong></h2><p>In analyzing the historical cases, we will be trying to build a coherent model of how researchers make scientific progress in the early stages of the development of scientific fields. We expect to approach this from many angles, looking at similarities and differences between cases, building causal models of the cases, and trying to state plausible general obstacles early stage researchers might encounter. By cross-checking the cases and the general model 11 against each other, we hope to improve our models of individual cases as well as our general model.</p><p>This may or may not lead to convergence on a single, intelligible general model that fits the cases and also is plausible abstractly. If it does, we will consider this evidence in favor of our hypothesis. If it does not, either because plausible general models do not fit the cases or because the general models contain attributes that are not intelligibly related to the logic of discovery in the early stages of a field, we will consider this evidence against our hypothesis.</p><p>If we reach an adequately plausible general model, we will then investigate whether it can be used to generate recommendations for present-day scientists seeking to make progress in fields operating under early stage research conditions. If a particular model relies heavily on factors local to the particular historical case, researcher, or era, it may not serve as a good template for recommendations for present-day scientists or a general theory of scientific methodology. On the other hand, if a model tends to feature potentially generalizable methodological elements with mechanistic relations (e.g., a particular model for how instrument development works at different levels of theoretical uncertainty), we can see whether the model can generate recommendations for current researchers.</p><h1><strong>Conclusion</strong></h1><p>Following the methodology above, we believe we will be able to select and analyze cases of discovery that have led to the development of highly functional scientific research programs. We expect our analysis to help confirm or disconfirm the existence of early stage science as a unique phase of science with a unique and understandable methodology. It is our hope that investigating this hypothesis will shed light on what methods should be used to make scientific progress in new or underdeveloped fields, and thereby help push science forward.</p><hr><h2><strong>Footnotes</strong></h2><ol><li>A later paper will situate our investigation in the surrounding literature, including describing our relation to Kuhn, Popper, Lakatos, historicism, methodologism, natural epistemology, and complementary science.</li><li>Black was likely not the original discoverer of the substance.

Imagine you're a fiddle player who primarily plays without effects,
but would occasionally like to be able to play with them.  What can
you do?



</p><p>

One option is to put a pickup on the fiddle and run that into guitar
pedals.  This will work, but pickups generally sound much worse than
clip-on mics like the ubiquitous <a href=""https://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/Pro35--audio-technica-pro-35-clip-on-instrument-microphone-xlr"">AT
PRO-35</a>.  Since you're mostly playing uneffected, you don't want to
give that up.

</p>

<p>

Another option is to get a vocal effects processor.  For example, I
have a <a href=""https://smile.amazon.com/Helicon-996004005-VoiceTone-Effects-Processor/dp/B00GPZCH50"">VoiceTone
D1</a>.  These take balanced XLR from the mic, send balanced XLR to
the board, and provide phantom power, so they make a lot of sense
technically.  Unfortunately, since they are designed for a vocal signal
I've found they sound pretty crummy when applied to fiddle or
mandolin.

</p>

<p>

A mixer should work here, but it seems like both overkill and a hack?
Get a small mixer with phantom power, run the output of the mixer into
a guitar pedal, run the output of the guitar pedal into another
channel on the mixer.  For example, with a cheap mixer like the <a href=""https://smile.amazon.com/Behringer-502-Premium-5-Input-British/dp/B000J5UEGQ/"">Behringer
Xenyx 502</a> you would:

</p>

<ul>
<li>run the mic into channel one, which provides phantom power</li>
<li>pan channel one hard right</li>
<li>run the right main output into the guitar pedal</li>
<li>run the guitar's pedal's output into channel 2 (left)</li>
<li>set the 2/3 balance to hard left</li>
<li>run the left main output (balanced) to the mixer</li>
</ul>

A slightly less cheap mixer (ex: the 

<a href=""https://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/Notepad5--soundcraft-notepad-5-mixer"">Soundcraft
Notepad-5</a>, which I have) lets you do this with a monitor channel
instead of panning, but it's still not ideal.



<p>

You're also in a funny place impedance-wise, where the guitar pedal
may be expecting a high impedance input or to be driving a high
impedance output.  If you need that you could add a reamper (<a href=""https://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/ProRMP--radial-prormp-1-channel-passive-re-amping-device"">ex</a>)
before the pedal and a DI (<a href=""https://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/ProDI--radial-prodi-1-channel-passive-instrument-direct-box"">ex</a>)
after.  I'm not sure whether this is something pedals tend to care about?

</p>

<p>

All of this seems like a mess to me.  It seems like maybe a bunch of
people would want a box with:

</p>

<ul>
<li>XLR input with phantom power</li>
<li>A good quality pre-amp with gain control</li>
<li>High-impedance 1/4"" output to the pedal</li>
<li>High-impedance 1/4"" input from the pedal</li>
<li>XLR output</li>
<li>Maybe a second dry-only XLR output</li>
</ul>

Does a box like this exist?  Alternatively, are there pedals in the
same form factor as the vocal effects processors, but that are
designed for instruments?

<p>This idea seems to be disputed fairly often, and this seems related to the concept of a distinction between ""risk"" and ""uncertainty"" (which <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Lq6LMfi9ZKBKsrcFD/risk-and-uncertainty-a-false-dichotomy"">I think is a confused concept</a>). I think the arguments against this idea are flawed. But I want to test my beliefs and properly engage with those arguments. So in this post, I first discuss how I believe we can arrive at, and make sense of, probability estimates in what are sometimes put forward as ""challenging cases"", before discussing what I think <em>is</em> probably the most challenging type of case: what I call ""supernatural-type"" claims.</p>
<h1>Weak examples of ""Knightian uncertainty""</h1>
<p>Sometimes people propose what seem to me to be <em>very weak</em> examples of cases in which, they propose, we simply cannot arrive at probability estimates. (This may be simply a result of them having a frequentist interpretation of probability, but this often doesn't seem to be made explicit or defended.) Here's one example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>there are situations with so many unique features that they can hardly be grouped with similar cases, such as the danger resulting from a new type of virus, or the consequences of military intervention in conflict areas. These represent cases of (Knightian) uncertainty where no data are available to estimate objective probabilities. While we may rely on our subjective estimates under such conditions, no objective basis exists by which to judge them (e.g., LeRoy &amp; Singell, 1987). (<a href=""https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7856/76681b25175e53685d1a9277b20a0656b93b.pdf"">source</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems obvious to me that a <em>wealth</em> of data <em>is</em> available for such cases. There have been <em>many</em> viruses and military interventions before. None of those situations will perfectly mirror the situations we’re trying to predict, and that’s definitely a very important point. We should therefore think very carefully about whether we’re being too confident in our predictions (i.e., using too narrow a “confidence interval”<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-hsM8Svdg27Z4WPXtZ-1"" id=""fnref-hsM8Svdg27Z4WPXtZ-1"">[1]</a></sup> and thus not adequately preparing for especially “high” or “low” possibilities).</p>
<p>But we can clearly do better than nothing. To start small, you’d be comfortable with the claim that a new type of virus, if it hits this year, is more likely to kill somewhere between 0 and 1 billion people than somewhere between 1000 and 1001 billion people (i.e., far more than everyone alive), right? And in fact, we have <em>empirical evidence</em> that some people can reliably do better than chance (and better than “0 to 1 billion”) in making predictions about geopolitical events like these, at least over timelines of a few years (from <a href=""https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/philip-tetlock-forecasting-research/"">Tetlock’s</a> work).</p>
<h1>AGI</h1>
<p>What about something that seems more unique or unprecedented, and where we also may have to stretch our predictions further into the future, like artificial general intelligence (AGI) timelines? On that question, experts disagree wildly, and are seemingly quite swayed by things like how the question is asked (<a href=""https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/katja-grace-forecasting-technology/"">Katja Grace on 80k</a>; search for “It’s a bit complicated” in the transcript). This makes me <em>highly</em> unconfident in any prediction I might make on the topic (and thus pushes me towards making decisions that are good given a wide range of possible timelines).</p>
<p>But I believe I know <em>more than nothing</em>. I believe I can reasonably assign <em>some probability distribution</em> (and then use something like the median or mean of that as if it were a point estimate, for certain purposes). If that seems like raw hubris, do you think it’s worth actually behaving as if AGI is just as likely to be developed 1 minute from now as somewhere around 2 to 300 years from now? What about behaving as if it’s likely to occur in some millennium 50 quintillion years from now, and not in this millennium? So you’d at least be fairly happy bounding your probability distribution somewhere in between those points 1 minute from now and 50 quintillion years from now, right?</p>
<p>One could say that all I’ve done there is argue that some probabilities we could assign would seem especially outrageous, not that we really can or should assign probabilities to this event. But if some probabilities <em>are</em> more reasonable than others (and it certainly <em>seems</em> they are, though I can’t prove it), then we can do better by using those probabilities than by using something like an uninformative prior.<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-hsM8Svdg27Z4WPXtZ-2"" id=""fnref-hsM8Svdg27Z4WPXtZ-2"">[2]</a></sup> And as far as I’m aware, principles for decision making <em>without</em> probabilities essentially collapse to acting as if using an uninformative prior or predictably lead to seemingly irrational and bad decisions (I’ll be posting about this soon).</p>
<p>And in any case, we <em>do</em> have <em>relevant</em> data for the AGI question, even if we’ve never developed <em>AGI itself</em> - we have data on AI development more broadly, development related to computing/IT/robotics more broadly, previous transformative technologies (e.g., electricity), the current state of funding for AI, current governmental stances towards AI development, how funding and governmental stances have influenced tech in the past, etc.</p>
<h1>Supernatural-type claims</h1>
<p>But that leads me to what <em>does</em> seem like it <em>could</em> be a strong type of counterexample to the idea that we can always assign probabilities: claims of a “supernatural”, “metaphysical”, or “unobservable” nature. These are very fuzzy and debatable terms, but defining them isn’t my main purpose here, so instead I’ll just jump into some examples:</p>
<ol>
<li>What are the odds that “an all-powerful god” exists?</li>
<li>What are the odds that “ghosts” exist?</li>
<li>What are the odds that “magic” exists?</li>
<li>What are the odds that “non-naturalistic moral realism” is correct (or that “non-natural objective moral facts” exist)?<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-hsM8Svdg27Z4WPXtZ-3"" id=""fnref-hsM8Svdg27Z4WPXtZ-3"">[3]</a></sup></li>
</ol>
<p>To me, and presumably most LessWrong readers, the most obvious response to these questions is to <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Mc6QcrsbH5NRXbCRX/dissolving-the-question"">dissolve</a> them, or to at least try to pin the questioner down on definitions. And I do think that's very reasonable. But in this post I want to put my (current) belief that ""we can always assign probabilities to propositions (or at least use something like an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prior_probability#Uninformative_priors"">uninformative prior</a>)"" to a particularly challenging test, so from here on I'll assume we've somehow arrived at a satisfactorily precise understanding of what the question is actually meant to mean.</p>
<p>In that case, my intuitions would suggest I should assign a very low probability to each of these propositions.<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-hsM8Svdg27Z4WPXtZ-4"" id=""fnref-hsM8Svdg27Z4WPXtZ-4"">[4]</a></sup> But what basis would I have for that? More specifically, what basis would I have for any <em>particular</em> probability (or probability distribution) I assign? And what would it even mean?</p>
<p>This is <a href=""https://coveragecritic.com/2019/04/03/the-optimizers-curse-wrong-way-reductions/"">Chris Smith</a>’s statement of this apparent issue, which was essentially what prompted this post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kyle is an atheist. When asked what odds he places on the possibility that an all-powerful god exists, he says “2%.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[...] I don’t know what to make of [Kyle’s] probability estimate.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[Kyle] wouldn’t be able to draw on past experiences with different realities (i.e., Kyle didn’t previously experience a bunch of realities and learn that some of them had all-powerful gods while others didn’t). If you push someone like Kyle to explain why they chose 2% rather than 4% or 0.5%, you almost certainly won’t get a clear explanation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If you gave the same “What probability do you place on the existence of an all-powerful god?” question to a number of self-proclaimed atheists, you’d probably get a wide range of answers.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I bet you’d find that some people would give answers like 10%, others 1%, and others 0.001%. While these probabilities can all be described as “low,” they differ by orders of magnitude. If probabilities like these are used alongside probabilistic decision models, they could have extremely different implications. Going forward, I’m going to call probability estimates like these “hazy probabilities.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can sympathise with Smith’s concerns, though I think ultimately we <em>can</em> make sense of Kyle’s probability estimate, and that Kyle <em>can</em> have at least some grounding for it. I’ll now try to explain why I think that, partly to solicit feedback on whether this thinking (and my explanation of it) makes sense.</p>
<p>In the non-supernatural cases mentioned earlier, it seemed clear to me that we had relevant data and theories. We have data on previous viruses and military interventions (albeit likely from different contexts and circumstances), and some relevant theoretical understandings (e.g., from biology and epidemiology, in the virus case). We lack data on a previous completed instance of AGI development, but we have data on cases we could argue are <em>somewhat</em> analogous (e.g., the industrial revolution, development and roll-out of electricity, development of the atomic bomb, development of the internet), and we have theoretical understandings that can guide us in our <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_class_forecasting"">reference class forecasting</a>.</p>
<p>But do we have <em>any</em> relevant data or theories for the supernatural-type cases?</p>
<h2>Assuming that whether the claim is true <em>can</em> affect the world</h2>
<p>Let’s first make the assumption (which I’ll reverse later) that these propositions, if true, would <em>at some point</em> have at least <em>some</em>, <em>theoretically observable</em> consequences. That is, we’ll first assume that we’re <em>not</em> dealing with an utterly unverifiable, unfalsifiable hypothesis, the truth of which would have no impact on the world anyway (see also <a href=""https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/The_Dragon_in_My_Garage"">Carl Sagan’s dragon</a>).<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-hsM8Svdg27Z4WPXtZ-5"" id=""fnref-hsM8Svdg27Z4WPXtZ-5"">[5]</a></sup> This seems to be the assumption Smith is making, as he writes “Kyle didn’t previously experience a bunch of realities and learn that some of them had all-powerful gods while others didn’t”, implying that <em>it would be theoretically possible</em> to learn whether a given reality had an all-powerful god.</p>
<p>That assumption still leaves open the possibility that, <em>even if these propositions were true</em>, it’d be extremely unlikely we’d observe any evidence of them at all. This clearly makes it harder to assign probabilities to these propositions that are likely to track reality well. But is it <em>impossible</em> to assign <em>any</em> probabilities, or to make sense of probabilities that we assign?</p>
<p>It seems to me (though I’m unsure) that we could assign probabilities using something like the following process:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Try to think of all (or some sample of) the propositions that we know have ever been made that are similar to the proposition in question. This could mean something like one or more of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>All claims of a religious nature.</li>
<li>All claims that many people would consider “supernatural”.</li>
<li>All claims where no one really had a particular idea of what consequences we should expect to observe if they were true rather than false. (E.g., ghosts, given that they’re often interpreted as being meant to be invisible and incorporeal.)</li>
<li>All claims that are believed to roughly the same level by humanity as a whole or by some subpopulation (e.g., scientists).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Try to figure out how many of these propositions later turned out to be true.</p>
<ul>
<li>This may require debating what counts as still being the same proposition, if the proposition was originally very vague. For example, does the ability to keep objects afloat using magnets count as levitation?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do something along the lines of reference class forecasting using this “data”.</p>
<ul>
<li>This’ll likely require deciding whether certain data points count as a relevant claim turning out to <em>not be true</em> versus just <em>not yet</em> turning out to be true. This may look like <a href=""https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/daniel-kahneman-beware-the-inside-view"">inside-view</a>-style thinking about roughly how likely we think it’d be that we’d have observed evidence for that claim by now if it <em>is</em> true.</li>
<li>We might do something like giving some data points more or less “weight” depending on things like how similar they seem to the matter at hand or how confident we are in our assessment of whether that data point “turned out to be true” or not. (I haven’t thought through in detail precisely how you’d do this. You might instead construct multiple separate reference classes, and then combine these like in <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/iyRpsScBa6y4rduEt/model-combination-and-adjustment"">model combination</a>, giving different weights to the different classes.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If this reference class forecasting suggests odds of 0%, this seems too confident; it seems that we should <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ooypcn7qFzsMcy53R/infinite-certainty"">never</a> use probabilities of <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/QGkYCwyC7wTDyt3yT/0-and-1-are-not-probabilities"">0 or 1</a>. It seems that one option for handling this would be Laplace’s solution to the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_succession"">rule of succession</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, if we found that 18 out of 18 relevant claims for which we “have data” “turned out to be false”, our reference class forecast might suggest there’s a <em>100%</em> chance (because 18/18=1) that the claim under consideration will turn out to be false too. To avoid this absolute certainty, we add 1 to the numerator and 2 to the denominator (so we do 19/20=0.95), and find that there seems to be a 95% chance the claim under consideration will turn out to be false too.</li>
<li>There may be alternative solutions too, such as letting the inside view considerations introduced in the next step move one away from absolute certainty.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Construct an ""inside view"" relevant to how likely the claim is to be true. This may involve considerations like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Knowledge from other fields (e.g., physics), and thinking about how consistent this claim is with that knowledge (and perhaps also about how well consistency with knowledge from other fields has predicted truth in the past).</li>
<li>The extent to which the claim violates Occam’s razor, and how bad it is for a claim to do so (perhaps based on how well sticking to Occam’s razor has seemed to predict the accuracy of claims in the past).</li>
<li>Explanations for why the claim would be made and believed as widely as it is even if it <em>isn’t</em> true. E.g., explanations from the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_psychology_of_religion"">evolutionary psychology of religion</a>, or explanations based on <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memetics"">memetics</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Combine the reference class forecast and the inside view somehow. (Perhaps qualitatively, or perhaps via explicit <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/iyRpsScBa6y4rduEt/model-combination-and-adjustment"">model combination</a>.)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I don’t expect that many people <em>actually, explicitly</em> use the above process (I personally haven’t). But I think it’d be <em>possible</em> to do so. And if we want to know “what to make of” probability estimates for these sorts of claims, we could <em>perhaps</em> think of what we actually do, which is more implicit/intuitive, as ""approximating"" that explicit process. (But that’s a somewhat separate and debatable claim; my core claims are consistent with the idea that <em>in practice</em> people are coming to their probability assignments quite randomly.)</p>
<p>Another, probably more realistic way people could arrive at probability estimates for these sorts of claims is the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Do some <em>very vague</em>, <em>very implicit</em> version of the above.</p>
<ul>
<li>E.g., just “thinking about” how often things “like this” have seemed true in the past (without actually counting up various cases), and “thinking about” how likely the claim seems to you, when you bear in mind things like physics and Occam’s razor.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then introspect on how likely this claim “feels” to you, and try to arrive at a number to represent that.</p>
<ul>
<li>One method to do so is Hubbard’s “equivalent bet test” (described <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ybYBCK9D7MZCcdArB/how-to-measure-anything"">here</a>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Many people may find that method quite suspicious. But there’s evidence that, at least in some domains, it’s possible to become fairly “well calibrated” (i.e., do better than chance at assigning probability estimates) following “calibration training” (see <a href=""https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/efforts-improve-accuracy-our-judgments-and-forecasts"">here</a> and <a href=""https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/new-web-app-calibration-training"">here</a>). Ideally, the person using that method would have engaged in such calibration training before. If they have, they might add a third step, or add as part of step 2, an adjustment to account for them tending to over- or underestimate probabilities (either probabilities in general, or probabilities of roughly this kind).</p>
<p>I’m not aware of any evidence regarding whether people can become well-calibrated for these “supernatural-type claims”. And I believe there’s somewhat limited evidence on how well calibration training generalises across domains. So I think there are major reasons for skepticism, which I’d translate into large confidence intervals on my probability distributions.</p>
<p>But I’m also not aware of any <em>extremely compelling</em> arguments or evidence indicating that people <em>wouldn’t</em> be able to become well-calibrated for these sorts of claims, or that calibration training <em>wouldn’t</em> generalise to domains like this. So for now, I <em>think</em> I’d say that we can make sense of probability estimates for claims like these, and that we should have at least a <em>very weak</em> expectation that methods like the above will result in better probability estimates than if we acted as though we knew <em>nothing at all</em>.</p>
<h2>Assuming that whether the claim is true <em>can't</em> affect the world</h2>
<p>I think the much trickier case is if we assume that the truth of these claims would <em>never</em> affect the (natural/physical/whatever) world at all, and would thus <em>never</em> be observable. I think the standard rationalist response to this possibility is dismissiveness, and the argument that, under those conditions, whether or not these claims are true is an utterly meaningless and unimportant question. The claims are empty, and not worth arguing about.</p>
<p>I find this response <em>very compelling</em>, and it’s the one I’ve typically gone with. I think that, if we can just show that probabilities can be meaningfully assigned to all claims that could ever theoretically affect the natural world at all, that’s probably good enough.</p>
<p>But what if, for the sake of the argument, we entertain the possibility that some claims may never affect the natural world, and yet still be important? Me not dismissing that possibility outright and immediately may annoy some readers, and I can sympathise with that. But it seems to me at least interesting to think about. And here’s one case where that possibly actually <em>does</em> seem to me like it could be important:</p>
<p>What if non-naturalistic moral realism is “correct”, and what that means is that “moral facts” will <em>never</em> affect the natural world, and will thus <em>never</em> be observable, even in principle - <em>but</em> our actions are still somehow relevant to these moral facts? E.g., what if it could be the case that it’s “good” for us to do one thing rather than another, in some sense that we “really should” care about, and yet “goodness” itself leaves no trace at all in the natural world? (This could perhaps be something like <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiphenomenalism"">epiphenomenalism</a>, but here I’m going quite a bit beyond what I really know.)</p>
<p>In this case, I think reference forecasting is useless, because we’d never have any data on the truth or falsehood of any claims of the right type.</p>
<p>But at first glance, it still <em>seems to me</em> like we may be able to make some headway using inside views, or something like arriving at a “feeling” about the likelihood and then quantifying this using the equivalent bet test. I’m very unsure about that, because usually those methods should rely on at least <em>some</em>, <em>somewhat relevant</em> data. But it seems like perhaps we can still usefully use considerations like how often Occam’s razor has worked well in the past.</p>
<p>And this also reminds me of Scott Alexander’s post on <a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/11/06/building-intuitions-on-non-empirical-arguments-in-science/"">building intuitions on non-empirical arguments in science</a> (additional post on that <a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/11/18/more-intuition-building-on-non-empirical-science-three-stories/"">here</a>). It also seems reminiscent of some of Eliezer Yudkowsky’s writing on the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, though I read those posts a little while ago and didn’t have this idea in mind at the time.<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-hsM8Svdg27Z4WPXtZ-6"" id=""fnref-hsM8Svdg27Z4WPXtZ-6"">[6]</a></sup></p>
<h1>Closing remarks</h1>
<p>This quick post has become longer than planned, so I’ll stop there. The basic summary is that I tentatively claim we <em>can</em> always assign meaningful probabilities, even to supernatural-type (or even actually supernatural) claims. I’m <em>not</em> claiming we should be confident in these probabilities, and in fact, I expect many people should massively reduce their confidence in their probability estimates. I’m also <em>not</em> claiming that the probabilities people <em>actually</em> assign are reliably better than chance - that’s an empirical question, and again there’d likely be issues of overconfidence.</p>
<p>As I said at the start, a major aim of this post is to get feedback on my thinking. So please let me know what you think in the comments.</p>

While all the preceding tools apply here, there&apos;s a suite of special options for examining this particular scenario.</p><h1>The &quot;World is Mad&quot; Dialectic</h1><p>Back in 2015, Ozymandias <a href=""https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2015/10/30/the-world-is-mad/"">wrote</a>:</p><blockquote>I think a formative moment for any  rationalist&#x2013; our &#x201C;Uncle Ben shot by the mugger&#x201D; moment, if you will&#x2013; is  the moment you go &#x201C;holy shit, everyone in the world is fucking insane.&#x201D;</blockquote><blockquote>First, you can say &#x201C;holy shit, everyone in  the world is fucking insane. Therefore, if I adopt the radical new  policy of not being fucking insane, I can pick up these giant piles of  utility everyone is leaving on the ground, and then I win.&#x201D;</blockquote><blockquote>Second, you can say &#x201C;holy shit, everyone  in the world is fucking insane. However, none of them seem to realize  that they&#x2019;re insane. By extension, I am probably insane. I should take  careful steps to minimize the damage I do.&#x201D;</blockquote><blockquote>I want to emphasize that these are not mutually exclusive. In fact, they&#x2019;re a <a href=""https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2015/08/08/dbt-sequence-dialectics/"">dialectic</a>&#xA0;(&#x2026;okay, look, this hammer I found is really neat and I want to find some place to use it). </blockquote><p>(I would define a &quot;dialectic&quot; as two superficially opposite statements, both of which are true, in such a way that resolving the apparent paradox forces you to build a usefully richer world-model.  I have not run this definition past Ozy, much less Hegel.)</p><p>To which Eliezer <a href=""https://equilibriabook.com/living-in-an-inadequate-world/"">replied in 2017</a>:</p><blockquote>But, speaking first to the basic dichotomy that&#x2019;s being proposed, the whole point of becoming sane is that your beliefs <em>shouldn&#x2019;t</em>  reflect what sort of person you are. To the extent you&#x2019;re succeeding,  at least, your beliefs should just reflect how the world is.</blockquote><h2>Good News, Everyone!</h2><p>I did <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/dspeyer/comments/enycia/on_nov_29_2015_i_completed_myworld_is_madsurvey/"">an empirical test</a> and found no sign of a general factor of trusting your own reasoning.</p><p>But I did find lots of disagreement.  What are people deciding based on?</p><h1>Types of Disagreement</h1><h2>Explicit</h2><p>The expert actually said the opposite of your conclusion.</p><p>This is the simplest form of disagreement.  The expert could still be wrong, or lying, or communicating unclearly and not actually saying what you think they said.  But at least there&apos;s no complications from the form of disagreement itself.</p><p>The &quot;communicating unclearly&quot; hypothesis should always be high in your probability space.  Communication is hard.  (It could be spun as &quot;you misunderstood&quot;, but this makes the theory less pleasant without altering its substance, so generally don&apos;t bother.)</p><p>The lying theory is tricky, as it can explain anything.  A good lying-based theory should explain why the expert told that particular lie out of millions of possibilities.  Without that, the theory contains a contrived co-incidence, and should be penalized accordingly.</p><p>With explicit disagreement, you may be able to find the expert&apos;s reasoning.  If so, try to find the crux and recurse.  If you can&apos;t follow the reasoning, this is a sign that the expert <em>either</em> understands something important that you don&apos;t, <em>or</em> is spouting complete bullshit.  Look for signs that the expert has substance, such as real-world accomplishments or specific endorsements from notably perceptive and honest people.</p><h2>Superlative or Silence</h2><p>If an expert oncologist says &quot;glycolisis inhibitors are the best available treatment for this sort of cancer&quot; -- and you think it might be better to use oil-drop immersion to sequence the tumor cells, find the root mutation, and CRISPR an aggressive protease into that spot -- then technically you are disagreeing.  This is similar to if she is asked for something better than glycolisis inhibitors and says nothing.</p><p>But it&apos;s not really an active disagreement.  Most likely she&apos;s never <em>considered</em> the sequence-and-CRISPR  possibility.</p><p>(Alternative theory: she doesn&apos;t consider a therapy to be &quot;available&quot; if it isn&apos;t well-tested and endorsed by appropriate parties, even if it is something an agenty patient with moderate wealth could probably obtain.  Communication is hard!)</p><p>Nobody considers every possibility.  What people who try usually do in practice is depend on a large community to do the search.  This means that if an individual disagrees with you via superlative or silence, your real disagreement is with the community they depend on.</p><h2>Implied by Action</h2><p>An expert takes actions which suggest a disagreement.  </p><p>A venture capitalist declines to invest in a cancer-curing startup.  Does this mean he thinks the  cure doesn&apos;t work?</p><p>Maybe there&apos;s other factors in the decision.  Maybe he thinks the founder has no head for business, and the company is fatally underestimating regulatory hurtles, but he would invest in the same technology in better hands.  Unless you have a very close seat of observation, this looks the same to you.</p><p>Or maybe his values are not what you think.  Maybe he&apos;s very focused on short-term returns, and a company which is five years away from revenue is of no interest to him.</p><h1>Types of Experts</h1><h2>Individuals</h2><p>By far the most straightforward.</p><p>Do consider how much of an expert the person is on this exact question.  Many experts have broad knowledge, which comes at an opportunity cost of depth.  Do you know more about medicine than a randomly chosen doctor?  Almost certainly not.  (Unless you are a doctor yourself, of course.)  Do you know more about one particular disease that said doctor doesn&apos;t specialize in?  Perhaps one that you have?  Entirely possible.  More about the exact variation which you have?  (Cases of a disease are not identical.)  Quite likely.</p><p>Also consider how much effort the expert put into forming their opinion. Do they have skin in the game?  Is it their job to worry about questions like this?  (And if so, how dutiful are they?)  If this is their way of brushing you off?  (If so, respect that decision and go ponder elsewhere.) The further down the list, the more likely they could be wrong because they don&apos;t care enough to be right.</p><h2>Institutions or Communities</h2><p>Eliezer just wrote <a href=""https://equilibriabook.com"">an entire book</a> on the subject.  You&apos;d think I wouldn&apos;t have much to add.</p><p>In fact I do.  In addition to everything he wrote, consider the <em>size</em> of the community.  This is especially relevant to superlative or silence disagreements, where the key question is &quot;Did anybody evaluate this?&quot;</p><p>The ratio of particle physicists to types of fundamental particles is about a thousand to one, and the number of ways those particles can interact is pretty limited.  The odds that you&apos;ve thought of a good question about particle physics which no established physicist already considered are pretty low.  (Unless you have studied deeply in the field, of course.)</p><p>The ratio of entomologists to species of insect is closer to one to a thousand.  Asking a good question about insects which no entomologist has seriously considered is pretty easy.</p><p>(The ratio of intestinal microbiologists to species in the intestinal microbiome is unknown -- we <em>don&apos;t have a good estimate</em> of the latter.)</p><p>I suspect this is an important piece of why Eliezer was able to outdo the psychiatric community regarding Seasonal Affective Disorder.  True, there are a lot of psychiatric researchers, but there are a lot of conditions for them to study, and SAD isn&apos;t a high priority.  Once you zoom in to those working on treatmentment-resistant-SAD, the numbers aren&apos;t that high, and things fall through the gaps.</p><p>An order-of-magnitude fermi estimate can be useful here.</p><h2>Traditions or Biology</h2><p>Traditions and biology have something in common: they are formed by evolution.</p><p>Evolution does not share your values.  You can often tell what its values are, but it&apos;s a constant effort to remember this.</p><p>It also has a tendency to take undocumented dependencies on circumstances.  It can be <em>really hard</em> to figure out which aspects of the environment cause a solution evolution picked to be the ideal one.</p><h2>Markets</h2><p>Zvi has <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2018/07/26/prediction-markets-when-do-they-work/"">written about this at length</a>.</p><p>One thing I&apos;d add is low-friction.  This is especially important for refining odds far from 50%.  If someone&apos;s offering a bet on &quot;pi will equal 3 tomorrow&quot; and I can buy &quot;no&quot; for $0.96 and get $1.00 when it resolves, but the betting site will take 5% of my winnings as a fee, I&apos;m not going to bet.  So the odds on the proposition will stay at the absurdly high 4%.</p><p>Tying up money that has been bet counts as a type of friction.  If $0.96 will get me $1.00 in a year with no fee, but index funds are getting 5%/year and I can&apos;t do both, I have very little reason to take the bet.  Labor can also be a type of friction, especially if bet sizes are capped. If I could gain $100 but it would require five hours of wrestling with terrible UIs or APIs (or studying cryptocurrencies), there&apos;s little incentive to bet.</p><p>Zvi describes how friction like this can drive people away from a market and make it too small to be useful.  And that may well be the primary effect.  But it can also cause asymmetric distortions, driving all probabilities toward the middle.</p><br>",dspeyer,dspeyer,dspeyer,

I worked with Nat Kozak and Chelsea Voss, who were both focused more on logistics. Chelsea was also the official leader who oversaw both me and Nat and had final say on disputes. (However, I was granted dictatorial control over the Solstice arc and had final say in that arena.) I legit have no idea how any one of us would have pulled this off without the others; love to both of them and also massive respect to Cody Wild, who somehow ran the entire thing herself in 2018.</p><p>While I worked with a bunch of other people on Solstice, all opinions expressed here are my own.&nbsp;</p><h1>Process</h1><h2>Beginnings &amp; research phase</h2><p>Chelsea, Nat, and I spent just about a full year preparing for Solstice. Our first meeting as a group was on January 20th, and we received official confirmation that we’d be in charge about a month later. In the following month, the three of us had roughly weekly planning meetings via video chat. In the first meeting, we set goals for what we wanted to have done by the first of April, and after that we checked in regularly for a while.</p><p>My goal by the first of April was to have a rough outline of the entire arc and a plan for how to make the tone be coherent. I also wanted to get a better handle on the task, and to that end I had conversations with several previous Solstice organizers and also read as much as I could. This included Ray’s sequence on ritual, most of the writing on the Secular Solstice website (both the <a href=""http://secularsolstice.com/blog/""><u>blog</u></a> and the <a href=""https://secularsolstice.com/resources/""><u>resources</u></a> section were useful), discussions on the Rational Ritual Facebook group, and whatever else I could find.&nbsp;</p><p>I also spent a full day listening to every single song that had ever been recommended for Solstice (see below) and making notes on them in a spreadsheet. When I ran out of songs in that reference class, I sorted my iTunes library by most listens and started going through to see if any of those songs might fit. This was quite surprisingly fruitful - I actually ended up using three of the songs that were originally put on my list in this way.</p><p>Another thing I did was go around and ask people what they wanted out of Solstice. I got responses that were actually fairly useful, like “I lose interest during long speeches” and “there should be more singalongs” and “I like singalongs but a lot of the songs have really complicated tunes and I can’t handle it.”</p><p>I think even with all that research and preparation, I still didn’t have a very good sense of the history of Solstice. I had only been to two big Bay Area Solstices, plus a private Solstice in the woods, plus a short, small, off-the-cuff Solstice that Habryka and I ran at my mom’s house in 2018. I wasn’t around for early Solstices, and I’d never seen what they were like in Boston, Seattle, or New York.&nbsp;</p><h2>Creating the setlist</h2><p><strong>The first setlist</strong></p><p>I met the April 1st deadline for having an outline of the entire arc. I drew up my first setlist in my notebook on a five-hour plane ride. I was taking into consideration more small snippets of advice than I can list here, but I can quote the guiding goal I referred to throughout the entirety of my time working on this Solstice:</p><blockquote><p>I want my Solstice to be about the brokenness of the world and the ethos of ""somebody has to and no one else will"", but also the fact that even if you exercise your individual agency to do the most you can, we still might fail.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Below are some sample pages from my notebook, with most names redacted. Note that I didn't ask any of these people before assigning them to songs; this was just idle speculation on a plane ride about who might be able to pull off each song.</p><figure

notebook</figcaption></figure><p>After that was a process of constant iteration.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Run-throughs</strong></p><p>We had our first full run-through of the setlist on June 16th. In the two months leading up to this, Chelsea checked in with me weekly. I had a lot of speeches to write and planned to write one and send it to her each week (which I more or less accomplished). I found this accountability mechanism quite helpful.</p><p>The first run-through was just me, Habryka, and Chelsea. We sat on the floor of my bedroom, played recordings of the songs to sing along with, and took turns reading the speeches. For this run-through, I wrote three new speeches, re-used two existing Solstice speeches, and threw in Pale Blue Dot, an abridged version of the poem <a href=""https://poets.org/poem/memoriam-ring-out-wild-bells""><u>Ring Out, Wild Bells</u></a>, and the Sequences post <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/fpecAJLG9czABgCe9/on-doing-the-impossible""><u>On Doing The Impossible</u></a>. After the run-through, which took about two hours (we timed each piece), the three of us debriefed, and I used the extensive notes I took to make changes to the setlist.</p><p>I felt burned out after this and had the luxury of taking all of July off from Solstice work. This was a huge benefit of starting so early.</p><p>The next run-through was in September, scheduled around the dates when our featured musician, Taylor (who lives in Vermont) would be in town. This was significantly more involved but still fairly informal. Seven people participated in total (including Ray, who was experimenting with projection), we provided our own instrumentation for most of the songs, and most of the speeches were read by the people who would eventually give them. Afterwards, each person individually gave me feedback, and again, I made significant changes to the setlist in response.</p><h2>Regular coworking hours</h2><p>Around the time of the September run-through, things really picked up. Going into crunch time, Chelsea, Nat, and I set up a regular time for Solstice coworking. We met for a couple hours every Monday night - that served both as our designated time to work on Solstice things (since we all also have day jobs) and an opportunity for in-person communication about high-context or sensitive topics.</p><h2>Choosing performers</h2><p><strong>Skill level</strong></p><p>We put out a <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/193wc6UEsvfm-_tQGKZRkCWU6yrb5XU6CGhA1pt2xpdk/edit""><u>call for auditions</u></a> in August, but we didn’t publicize it very well, so we didn’t receive many applications. I required auditions for speakers and singalong vocalists, but not for instrumentalists - in retrospect, this was an obvious mistake. I let almost all of the instrumentalists who applied participate in as many songs as they wanted, but there were issues with everything from not having time to rehearse to not being able to play in the key the vocalist wanted to disagreements on chords and time signatures.&nbsp;</p><p>Since we didn’t get enough applications to fill all the slots, I reached out to people who I already knew were competent from seeing them perform in previous Solstices or in other contexts (such as at jam sessions or in the REACH Musical Revue). This ended up working quite well - I think that everyone I chose in this way gave a good performance.</p><p>NYC has often hired professional musicians, rather than having community members provide the instrumentation - a possibility I knew about but never seriously considered. While I still wouldn’t pay for professional musicians, I’ve come to understand better why someone might decide to do so, after experiencing the difficulties (mentioned above) of getting amateur musicians to produce a performance-ready piece.</p><p>On the other hand, a lot of the amateurs did do an excellent job! So I think the takeaway here is just that it’s important to have people audition (or be very sure of their competence level in some other way) and make sure they’re able to put in the time commitment to rehearse.</p><p><strong>Orientation towards Solstice as a whole</strong></p><p>Something I struggled with a fair amount was disagreements about arc cohesion vs showcasing technical skill. Arc cohesion trumped all other concerns for me, with singalongability a close second. However, it’s often the case that when singers are given the chance to perform, they want to do something more interesting than just lead the melody of a singalong, so I was sometimes at loggerheads with performers who wanted to do more complex pieces or include intricate harmonies. There are some pieces for which I regret not being firmer about putting my foot down on this issue, and I think that ultimately it’s probably reasonable to exclude performers on this basis if you can’t come to an agreement.</p><p>On the flip side, I was extremely grateful to the people whose pieces I cut after the dress rehearsal, a week before the performance. I apologized to all of them and gave them the opportunity to contest the decision, but they were all really great about it and said things along the lines of “I care way more about Solstice being better than I do about cashing out on the work I did.” To those people - I really appreciate you, and thank you for being wonderful!</p><h2>Final preparations</h2><p>In late November we did a walk-through of the venue (important for testing planetarium footage and lighting options), then in early December we had a tech rehearsal at the planetarium (mostly for A/V) and a dress rehearsal (not at the planetarium). Much of the benefit here was logistical, and I won’t touch on that too much since it’s not my wheelhouse, but it also gave me a chance to see what the final product would be like. I was originally supposed to stop editing the setlist entirely on November 5th, but in reality, I made several changes to the order and even cut some pieces in response to the dress rehearsal, and the exact content of some things was kind of up in the air even on the day of. While I technically missed my deadline or whatever, I don’t regret that at all - I think my Solstice was quite significantly better than it would have been if I had stopped iterating on the setlist a month earlier.</p><h1>Considerations for creating a setlist</h1><h2>Creating a cohesive message</h2><p>When it came to speeches, I took an arc-first approach. I decided what message fit in every place in the arc and found a piece that fit there. Only after that did I approach potential speakers. I ended up using four existing pieces wholesale; the rest were based on existing pieces but were either remixed or heavily edited by the speaker. The takeaway action item here is to have something very specific in mind for each speech and conveying that to the speaker. This improves cohesion while still allowing each speaker to put their own twist on the piece if they so choose.</p><p>Examples:</p><ul><li>Tessa remixed Ray’s <i>A Bottomless Pit of Suffering </i>to make more sense in Berkeley (it was originally given in NYC, where it’s very cold) and to have more of her own voice.</li><li>I had Nate Soares on the docket from quite early on in the process, but he’s busy executive-directing MIRI so I didn’t want to take up too much of his time. With his input, I chose an old post from his blog for him to read (<a href=""http://mindingourway.com/how-we-will-be-measured/""><i><u>How We Will Be Measured</u></i></a>), and Chelsea and I edited it to be shorter and more appropriate as a speech. Nate then made a bunch of his own changes to reflect the ways his thinking has changed over the past few years, but ultimately it was still recognizable as the same piece.</li><li>Though it ended up being cut at the very last minute, Alex Altair adapted a scene from HPMoR into a speech, which was pretty cool.</li></ul><h2>Creating a smooth arc</h2><p>In order to create a smooth experience, you have to make sure that there are smooth transitions&nbsp; between the message, emotional tone, and musical/artistic feel of each piece and the next. It turns out to be really hard to match these all up. For example, there are some funny/upbeat/light-hearted songs about death (e.g. <i>We Will All Go Together When We Go</i>), and some fairly serious-sounding songs about more light-hearted topics (e.g. <i>Time Wrote the Rocks</i>). Some songs are up-tempo, some are slow and mournful, some have percussion, some are performed by choir. There are just a ton of considerations. (This is why Ray writes so many of his own songs - that’s the only way you can really have control over the message, tone, and feel all at once.)</p><p>I was aware of all of these considerations, and that’s a big part of the reason that I made sure to run through each version of the setlist from start to finish, but I don’t think I quite got it right until the final performance (even the dress rehearsal, one week prior, was fairly rocky in this regard). And even then there were still a few problems, like the energy drop from Son of Man to Uplift and the energy drop from Singularity to Five Thousand Years (making Five Thousand Years a rather anticlimactic finale).</p><h2>MCing&nbsp;</h2><p>The previous Solstices I had attended were just a series of pieces strung together, and the audience were mostly left to discern the arc on their own. At some point in my research, I saw a video clip of Kenzi MCing a Solstice, and I immediately decided I wanted to do that.&nbsp;</p><p>In my opinion, there are a ton of advantages to having an MC. Here are a couple:</p><ol><li>It gives the audience more insight into why each piece was chosen and generally gives you a chance to tie the arc together more explicitly.</li><li>It allows you to make announcements during the program without breaking immersion, such as giving trigger warnings or asking the audience to hold their applause until further notice.</li><li>It fills what would otherwise be awkward pauses between pieces as performers get on and off the stage.</li></ol><h1>Post-performance feedback</h1><p>About 50 people filled out the feedback survey, and their feedback falls into a few rough categories for me:</p><ol><li>“This person is right and I would change/tweak this if I had it to do over”</li><li>“This feedback should not be acted upon”</li><li>“Feedback on this is very split, and you can’t win ‘em all”</li></ol><h2>Things I would tweak</h2><p><strong>Finale</strong></p><p>The peak-end rule is really important, and my Solstice didn’t have a very strong ending. I had to go up onstage and be like, “Okay, now it’s over.” If I had it to do over, I might cut Five Thousand Years and end on Singularity, which everyone loved.</p><p><strong>Moment of darkness</strong></p><p>The moment of darkness itself (two minutes of silence in the pitch black) got mixed reviews - some people found it very powerful, some people found it existentially horrifying and had to distract themselves, and a lot of people found it didn’t really land. The main thing I would change here is the way I introduced it.</p><p>I said, “We’re about to sit in silence for two minutes. If you’re up for it, I want you to look up at the stars, and think of someone you’ve lost. Someone whose voice you will never hear again, whose mind is gone from the world forever. Give them your grief, yes, but also give them your resolve.”</p><p>In retrospect, this was far too specific an ask. A lot of people said that the moment of darkness didn’t really land specifically because they’d never lost anyone close to them. (I copied the text from the Solstice Habryka and I ran in Madison, where it worked very well, but where the circumstances were very different in quite a number of significant ways.) If I had it to do over, I would encourage people to sit with their feelings, wherever they were at, rather than prescribing something for them to think about.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>First speech</strong></p><p>I struggled for a long time to find or write an appropriate speech for the first-speech slot in the program. It was only a day or so before the dress rehearsal that I settled on giving an abridged version of Nate’s This Is A Dawn. While it had roughly the right message, I don’t think I myself was that bought into it, and as a result, people seemed to find it a bit generic, and not really meaningful. I’m not actually sure what in particular I would do here if I had a do-over, but I do want to highlight that the first-speech slot is quite important and I definitely didn’t totally nail it.</p><h2>Feedback that should not be acted upon</h2><p>A hopefully uncontroversial example of this is the person who doesn’t like the sound of strummed instruments, and therefore gave a low rating to every song with strummed guitars. Sure, this is a valid way to feel, but at the same time, one person’s preference in this area does not mean it makes sense to cut all guitars from Solstice.</p><p>A more controversial example, but one that I am still willing to stand by publicly, is the common complaint that <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiBaBca7-rY""><u>Son of Man</u></a> is sexist. Look, I’m a woman. Chelsea is a woman. The person who soloed on Son of Man is a woman. My sense is that, while some people were genuinely offended, and that came through in their feedback, most of the people who registered complaints were just people who were worried that other people might have been offended. I continue to think this song is an excellent fit for Solstice message-wise and has great energy (it was intended to be performed a bit faster but there were some technical difficulties with the drums). I would not hesitate to include it again.</p><h1>Triggering content</h1><h2>Eating disorder trigger</h2><p>For complicated reasons, there was a brief discussion of weight loss at the end of Solstice. It was intended as a sort of light-hearted post-credits piece, but we mishandled it, and people didn’t end up getting the chance to leave if the topic was difficult for them. This had significant negative consequences for some people, and I sincerely apologize for that.</p><p>We’re taking steps to make sure that future Bay Solstices are more careful around sensitive topics like this. Specific action items include providing verbal trigger warnings in addition to the ones written in the program, and allowing significantly more time for people to leave if they need to, including having some people planted in the audience to stand up and leave so that it feels socially okay to do so. (Even though I myself won’t be running Solstice next year, I’m in close contact with next year’s organizers and have made at least one of them aware of this.)</p><h2>Other triggers</h2><p>On the feedback form, some people mentioned being very upset by Solstice because it reminded them that they were lonely or felt like they could be accomplishing more. I do not think anything should change about Solstice itself in response to this feedback, because being reminded that the universe is vast and dark and cold is pretty much the entire point of Solstice.&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps in the future it would be good to make it clear to potential Solstice-goers that Solstice deals a lot with death, individual responsibility, and the vast, uncaring universe. Then they can make more of an informed choice about whether or not to go, and if they can’t handle it, they can’t reasonably blame it on anyone but themselves.</p><h2>Individual pieces</h2><p><strong>Raw feedback</strong></p><p>(The table below has the pieces in chronological order of how they appeared in the performance.)</p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td><strong>Hated</strong></td><td><strong>Dislike</strong></td><td><strong>Meh</strong></td><td><strong>Like</strong></td><td><strong>Love</strong></td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>The Circle</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>6</td><td>12</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>The X days of X-Risk</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>7</td><td>16</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>To Drive the Cold Winter Away</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>14</td><td>16</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Bold Orion</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>4</td><td>20</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Time Wrote the Rocks</td><td>0</td><td>6</td><td>10</td><td>17</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>This is a Dawn (abridged)</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>12</td><td>19</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Hard Times Come Again No More</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>8</td><td>18</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>There Will Come Soft Rain</td><td>3</td><td>6</td><td>12</td><td>11</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>Pale Blue Dot</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>3</td><td>12</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Stardust</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>14</td><td>13</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>Do You Realize</td><td>1</td><td>4</td><td>6</td><td>16</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>A Bottomless Pit of Suffering</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>7</td><td>15</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>Bitter Wind Lullaby</td><td>0</td><td>3</td><td>11</td><td>16</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>Eulogy</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>8</td><td>33</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>The Moment of Darkness</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>15</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>Spoken Call/Response</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>11</td><td>18</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>We Are the Light</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>13</td><td>16</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>Light Pollution</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>12</td><td>19</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>Endless Lights</td><td>0</td><td>3</td><td>11</td><td>14</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>Brighter Than Today</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>16</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>21</td><td>How We Will Be Measured</td><td>0</td><td>4</td><td>12</td><td>15</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>22</td><td>Son of Man</td><td>3</td><td>6</td><td>10</td><td>15</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>23</td><td>Uplift</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>7</td><td>15</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>24</td><td>What it means to win</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>6</td><td>20</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>25</td><td>Beautiful Tomorrow</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>7</td><td>16</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>26</td><td>Singularity</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>9</td><td>31</td></tr><tr><td>27</td><td>Five Thousand Years</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>7</td><td>17</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>28</td><td>After-the-Credits-Eliezer-Bit</td><td>8</td><td>6</td><td>5</td><td>9</td><td>14</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>At a high level, most people liked most things! This is heartening.&nbsp;</p><p>Ray and I sorted the pieces four different ways*, and there were five pieces that clearly came out on top and five that (only a little bit less) clearly came out at the bottom.</p><p>Best-liked:</p><ol><li>Eulogy</li><li>Singularity</li><li>Pale Blue Dot</li><li>Brighter Than Today</li><li>Bold Orion</li></ol><p>Worst-liked:</p><ol><li>After-the-Credits Eliezer bit</li><li>Son of Man</li><li>There Will Come Soft Rain</li><li>We Are the Light</li><li>Light Pollution</li></ol><p><strong>Effect of delivery</strong></p><p>Something I notice that’s interesting (but not that surprising) is the large effect that delivery had on people’s ratings. For example, two of the highest rated pieces were Singularity and Pale Blue Dot. In addition to a solid delivery by Chelsea, Pale Blue Dot had a backing track and custom planetarium footage. Singularity was extremely energetic and fun, and people had generally positive affect towards all of the songs that prominently featured Taylor because he’s such an obviously skilled musician. Brighter Than Today and Bold Orion were also energetic and very polished performances.</p><p>By contrast, people were relatively lukewarm on Endless Lights and Bitter Wind Lullaby, two Solstice staples that I think of as being fairly well-liked in general. Both of these songs had significant problems with their execution, with the performers having trouble agreeing on the time signature. As a result, it was difficult for people to sing along, which seems to have made for a negative overall impression.</p><p><strong>Addressing the elephant in the room</strong></p><p>An additional thing that people who attended this Solstice might want to see addressed is what the heck was up with the Eliezer piece. Even apart from those who found it triggering or otherwise inappropriate, a lot of people were just confused about why it happened (e.g., several people's reaction was, ""Why is this guy talking to me like I'm his friend, I don't even know him""). The explanation is perhaps not all that satisfying, but I'll give it anyway.</p><p>In early October, Eliezer contacted me asking if he could do a shenanigan at Solstice. He explained his idea to me, and while I didn't really see how it would fit in, I also didn't want to reject him out of hand.</p><p>I talked to a couple people I trusted about this, and we came to the conclusion that it would be pretty valuable to have Eliezer onstage. The reasons for this were a bit nebulous, but roughly rested on the following:</p><ul><li>Regardless of any single community member's personal feelings on him and his writings, it's hard to deny that this community would not exist as it does today without Eliezer. (I, for example, came in through a chance encounter with HPMOR in high school, and basically every aspect of my current life is a direct result of that encounter.)</li><li>Eliezer has increasingly retreated from public life over the past few years, and this has resulted in some feelings of abandonment on the part of the community.</li><li>Having Eliezer onstage during Solstice would show his implicit support for the community and the event; following the above, it would remind the audience of what brought us all together and that we haven't been abandoned by our founders.</li></ul><p>Based on this reasoning, it was having Eliezer onstage that mattered, and the content of his piece wasn't really relevant. The eating disorder trigger was honestly not something I even considered until someone mentioned it after the dress rehearsal. It was at that point that I decided to move the piece to be 'post-credits' (it had previously been early in the program proper), to make it opt-out for people uncomfortable with the topic, but as mentioned above, I failed to handle this correctly.</p><p>It’s also worth noting that, while more people hated the Eliezer bit than hated any other piece, there were also a fair number of people who loved it (if you sort by the raw number of Loves, it comes dead middle). So it was in fact not universally reviled (lots of people found it hilarious or heartwarming); it was just very polarizing.</p><h1>Summary of takeaways</h1><p>This is just all of the takeaways from the main body of this post, in the order that they appeared.</p><ul><li>Starting a year in advance and testing and iterating often makes for a really good final product but also burns you out like hell. I think this was ultimately definitely worth it, but if I was told I had to do another year of this I would probably flee the country.</li><li>Deciding on a central theme/thesis for your Solstice early on is really important.</li><li>Set a regular time to work on Solstice things so that they don’t slip through the cracks, especially if you have a full-time job. It’s best if you can meet with other people regularly for this purpose, because accountability.</li><li>While hiring professional musicians may be easier, there are enough skilled musicians in the Bay Area rationalist community that I think it’s worthwhile to go that route, especially since this makes it feel more like a community event. Just make sure that people audition (or are known to be skilled and easy to work with) and can commit to rehearsing with each other.</li><li>Choose speakers and other performers largely based on their skill level, but it’s also important to make sure that they’re value-aligned with you when it comes to the Solstice you’re creating together.</li><li>It’s okay to iterate on the content until the very last minute so long as everyone is on the same page / no one is thrown off or blind-sided by the late changes.</li><li>If you want your arc to be really cohesive, you need to exert centralized control over each piece rather than just leaving performers to do their own thing.</li><li>It’s really hard to create a smooth arc over all the dimensions that matter. If you can write your own songs or work with a friend who can write original songs, this is a huge asset.</li><li>MCing is great.</li><li>Not all feedback should be acted upon.</li><li>Pay attention to the peak-end rule.</li><li>Potentially triggering topics should be handled more carefully than they were by me. It’s important for people to have a genuine opportunity to make an informed choice about what they’re exposed to.</li><li>Delivery/execution of pieces is just as important as (if not more important than) the semantic content and the fit in the arc.</li></ul><h1>Resources</h1><h2>Setlist spreadsheet</h2><p>I love spreadsheets with a passion, and I found keeping all of the relevant material in one place to be enormously helpful both for me and for communication purposes. (Whenever someone had a question about the arc, the performers, or anything, we could just pull up the spreadsheet, and even make a copy of it to see how changing the order of the pieces would feel.)</p><p><a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T97fixXZx81aJ-zIBM5b7UnQpv4TflXGuauly29PlLI/""><u>Here</u></a> is a template for the spreadsheet I used.

<p><em>In the course of this, I’ll introduce the distinction between what I’ll call “reality-revealing puzzles” and “reality-masking puzzles”—a distinction that I think is almost necessary for anyone attempting to develop a psychological art in ways that will help rather than harm. (And one I wish I’d had explicitly back when the Center for Applied Rationality was founded.)</em></p>
<p><em>I’ll also be trying to elaborate, here, on the notion we at CFAR have recently been tossing around about CFAR being an attempt to bridge between common sense and Singularity scenarios—an attempt to figure out how people can stay grounded in common sense and ordinary decency and humane values and so on, while also taking in (and planning actions within) the kind of universe we may actually be living in.</em></p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Arts grow from puzzles. I like to look at mathematics, or music, or ungodly things like marketing, and ask: What puzzles were its creators tinkering with that led them to leave behind these structures? (Structures now being used by other people, for other reasons.)</p>
<p>I picture arts like coral reefs. Coral polyps build shell-bits for their own reasons, but over time there accumulates a reef usable by others. Math built up like this—and math is now a powerful structure for building from. [Sales and Freud and modern marketing/self-help/sales etc. built up some patterns too—and our basic way of seeing each other and ourselves is now built partly in and from all these structures, for better and for worse.]</p>
<p>So let’s ask: What sort of reef is CFAR living within, and adding to? From what puzzles (what patterns of tinkering) has our “rationality” accumulated?</p>
<h2>Two kinds of puzzles: “reality-revealing” and “reality-masking”</h2>
<p>First, some background. Some puzzles invite a kind of tinkering that lets the world in and leaves you smarter. A kid whittling with a pocket knife is entangling her mind with bits of reality. So is a driver who notices something small about how pedestrians dart into streets, and adjusts accordingly. So also is the mathematician at her daily work. And so on.</p>
<p>Other puzzles (or other contexts) invite a kind of tinkering that has the opposite effect. They invite a tinkering that gradually figures out how to mask parts of the world from your vision. For example, some months into my work as a math tutor I realized I’d been unconsciously learning how to cue my students into acting like my words made sense (even when they didn’t). I’d learned to mask from my own senses the clues about what my students were and were not learning.</p>
<p>We’ll be referring to these puzzle-types a lot, so it’ll help to have a term for them. I’ll call these puzzles “good” or “reality-revealing” puzzles, and “bad” or “reality-masking” puzzles, respectively. Both puzzle-types appear abundantly in most folks’ lives, often mixed together. The same kid with the pocket knife who is busy entangling her mind with data about bark and woodchips and fine motor patterns (from the “good” puzzle of “how can I whittle this stick”), may simultaneously be busy tinkering with the “bad” puzzle of “how can I not-notice when my creations fall short of my hopes.”</p>
<p>(Even “good” puzzles can cause skill loss: a person who studies Dvorak may lose some of their QWERTY skill, and someone who adapts to the unselfconscious arguing of the math department may do worse for a while in contexts requiring tact. The distinction is that “good” puzzles do this <em>only incidentally.</em> Good puzzles do not invite a <em>search for</em> configurations that mask bits of reality. Whereas with me and my math tutees, say, there was a direct reward/conditioning response that happened specifically when the “they didn’t get it” signal was masked from my view. There was a small optimizer inside of me that was <em>learning</em> how to mask parts of the world from me, <em>via feedback from the systems of mine it was learning to befuddle</em>.)</p>
<p>Also, certain good puzzles (and certain bad ones!) allow unusually powerful accumulations across time. I’d list math, computer science, and the English language as examples of unusually powerful artifacts for improving vision. I’d list “sales and marketing skill” as an example of an unusually powerful artifact for impairing vision (the salesperson’s own vision, not just the customer’s).</p>
<h2>The puzzles that helped build CFAR</h2>
<p>Much of what I love about CFAR is linked to the puzzles we dwell near (the reality-revealing ones, I mean). And much of what gives me the shudders about CFAR comes from a reality-masking puzzle-set that’s been interlinked with these.</p>
<p>Eliezer created the Sequences after staring a lot at the AI alignment problem. He asked how a computer system could form a “map” that matches the territory; he asked how he himself could do the same. He asked, “Why do I believe what I believe?” and checked whether the <em>mechanistic causal history</em> that gave rise to his beliefs would have yielded <em>different beliefs in a world where different things were true.</em></p>
<p>There’s a springing up into self-awareness that can come from this! A taking hold of our power as humans to see. A child’s visceral sense that of course we care and should care—freed from its learned hopelessness. And taking on the stars themselves with daring!</p>
<p>CFAR took these origins and worked to make at least parts of them accessible to some who bounced off the Sequences, or who wouldn’t have read the Sequences. We created feedback loops for practicing some of the core Sequences-bits in the context of folks’ ordinary lives rather than in the context of philosophy puzzles. If you take a person (even a rather good scientist) and introduce them to the questions about AI and the long-term future… often nothing much happens in their head except some random stuck nonsense intuitions (“AIs wouldn’t do that, because they’re our offspring. What’s for lunch?”). So we built a way to practice some of the core moves that alignment thinking needed. Especially, we built a way to practice <em>having thoughts at all, in cases where standard just-do-what-the-neighbors-do strategies would tend to block them off.</em></p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Inner Simulator.</em> (Your “beliefs” are what you expect to see happen—not what you “endorse” on a verbal level. You can practice tracking these anticipations in daily life! And making plans with them! And once you’ve seen that they’re useful for planning—well, you might try also having them in contexts like AI risk. Turns out you have beliefs even where you don’t have official “expertise” or credentials authorizing belief-creation! And you can dialog with them, and there’s sense there.)</li>
<li><em>Crux-Mapping; Double Crux.</em> (Extends your ability to dialog with inner simulator-style beliefs. Lets you find in yourself a random opaque intuition about AI being [likely/unlikely/safe/whatever], and then query it via thought experiments until it is more made out of introspectable verbal reasoning. Lets two people with different intuitions collide them in verbal conversation.)</li>
<li><em>Goal Factoring and Units of Exchange.</em> (Life isn’t multiple choice; you can name the good things and the bad things, and you can invest in seeking the alternatives with more of the good and less of the bad. For example, if you could save 4 months in a world where you were allowed to complete your PhD early, it may be worth more than several hours to scheme out how to somehow purchase permission from your advisor, since 4 months is worth rather more than several hours.)</li>
<li><em>Hamming Questions.</em> (Some questions are worth a lot more than others. You want to focus at least some of your attention on the most important questions affecting your life, rather than just the random details in front of you. And you can just decide to do that on purpose, by using pen and paper and a timer!)<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-W7Ewv2y4RqvAWhizb-1"" id=""fnref-W7Ewv2y4RqvAWhizb-1"">[1]</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>Much good resulted from this—many loved the Sequences; many loved CFAR’s intro workshops; and a fair number who started there went into careers in AI alignment work and credited CFAR workshops as partially causal.</p>
<p>And still, as we did this, problems arose. AI risk is disorienting! Helping AI risk hit more people meant “helping” more people encounter something disorienting. And so we set to work on that as well. The thing I would say now about the reality-revealing puzzles that helped grow CFAR is that there were three, each closely linked with each other:</p>
<ol>
<li>Will AI at some point radically transform our lightcone? (How / why / with what details and intervention options?)</li>
<li>How do we get our minds to make contact with problem (1)? And how do we think groundedly about such things, rather than having accidental nonsense-intuitions and sticking there?</li>
<li>How do we stay human, and stay reliably in contact with what’s worth caring about (valuing honesty and compassion and hard work; having reliable friendships; being good people and good thinkers and doers), while still taking in how disorientingly different the future might be? (And while neither pretending that we have no shot at changing the future, nor that “what actions should I take to impact the future?” is a multiple choice question with nothing further to do, nor that any particular silly plan is more likely to work than it is?)</li>
</ol>
<p>CFAR grew up around all three of these puzzles—but (2) played an especially large role over most of our history, and (3) has played an especially large role over the last year and (I think) will over the coming one.</p>
<p>I’d like to talk now about (3), and about the disorientation patterns that make (3) needed.</p>
<h2>Disorientation patterns</h2>
<p>To start with an analogous event: The process of losing a deeply held childhood religion can be quite disruptive to a person’s common sense and values. Let us take as examples the two commonsensical statements:</p>
<ul>
<li>(A) It is worth getting out of bed in the morning; and,</li>
<li>(B) It is okay to care about my friends.</li>
</ul>
<p>These two commonsensical statements are held by most religious people. They are actually also held by most atheists. Nevertheless, when a person loses their religion, they fairly often become temporarily unsure about whether these two statements (and various similar such statements) are true. That’s because somehow the person’s understanding of why statements (A) and (B) are true was often tangled up in (for example) Jehovah. And figuring out how to think about these things in the absence of their childhood religion (even in cases like this one where the statements should survive!) can require actual work. (This is particularly true because some things really are different given that Jehovah is false—and it can take work to determine which is which.)</p>
<p>Over the last 12 years, I’ve chatted with small hundreds of people who were somewhere “in process” along the path toward “okay I guess I should take Singularity scenarios seriously.”  From watching them, my guess is that the process of coming to take Singularity scenarios seriously is often even more disruptive than is losing a childhood religion. Among many other things, I have seen it sometimes disrupt:</p>
<ul>
<li>People's belief that they should have rest, free time, some money/time/energy to spend on objects of their choosing, abundant sleep, etc.
<ul>
<li>“It used to be okay to buy myself hot cocoa from time to time, because there used to be nothing important I could do with money. But now—should I never buy hot cocoa? Should I agonize freshly each time? If I do buy a hot cocoa does that mean I don’t care?”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>People's in-practice ability to “hang out”—to enjoy their friends, or the beach, in a “just being in the moment” kind of way.
<ul>
<li>“Here I am at the beach like my to-do list told me to be, since I’m a good EA who is planning not to burn out. I’ve got my friends, beer, guitar, waves: check. But how is it that I used to be able to enter “hanging out mode”?  And why do my friends keep making meaningless mouth-noises that have nothing to do with what’s eventually going to happen to everyone?”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>People's understanding of whether commonsense morality holds, and of whether they can expect other folks in this space to also believe that commonsense morality holds.
<ul>
<li>“Given the vast cosmic stakes, surely doing the thing that is expedient is more important than, say, honesty?”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>People's in-practice tendency to have serious hobbies and to take a deep interest in how the world works.
<ul>
<li>“I used to enjoy learning mathematics just for the sake of it, and trying to understand history for fun. But it’s actually jillions of times higher value to work on [decision theory, or ML, or whatever else is pre-labeled as ‘AI risk relevant’].”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>People's ability to link in with ordinary institutions and take them seriously (e.g. to continue learning from their day job and caring about their colleagues’ progress and problems; to continue enjoying the dance club they used to dance at; to continue to take an interest in their significant other’s life and work; to continue learning from their PhD program; etc.)
<ul>
<li>“Here I am at my day job, meaninglessly doing nothing to help no one, while the world is at stake—how is it that before learning about the Singularity, I used to be learning skills and finding meaning and enjoying myself in this role?”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>People's understanding of what’s worth caring about, or what’s worth fighting for
<ul>
<li>“So… ‘happiness’ is valuable, which means that I should hope we get an AI that tiles the universe with a single repeating mouse orgasm, right? ... I wonder why imagining a ‘valuable’ future doesn’t feel that good/motivating to me.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>People's understanding of when to use their own judgment and when to defer to others.
<ul>
<li>“AI risk is really really important… which probably means I should pick some random person at MIRI or CEA or somewhere and assume they know more than I do about my own career and future, right?”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>My take is that many of these disorientation-bits are analogous to the new atheist’s disorientation discussed earlier. “Getting out of bed in the morning” and “caring about one’s friends” turn out to be useful for more reasons than Jehovah—but their derivation in the mind of that person was entangled with Jehovah. Honesty is analogously valuable for <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yz2btSaCLHmLWgWD5/protected-from-myself"">more</a> <a href=""https://sideways-view.com/2016/11/14/integrity-for-consequentialists/"">reasons</a> than its value as a local consumption good; and many of these reasons apply extra if the stakes are high. But the derivation of honesty that many folks were raised with does not survive the change in imagined surroundings—and so it needs to be thought through freshly.</p>
<p>Another part of the disorientation perhaps stems from emotional reeling in contact with the possibility of death (both one’s own death, and the death of the larger culture/tribe/species/values/life one has been part of).</p>
<p>And yet another part seems to me to stem from a set of “bad” puzzles that were inadvertently joined with the “good” puzzles involved in thinking through Singularity scenarios—“bad” puzzles that disable the mental immune systems that normally prevent updating in huge ways from weird and out-there claims. I’ll postpone this third part for a section and then return to it.</p>
<h2>There is value in helping people with this disorientation; and much of this helping work is tractable</h2>
<p>It seems not-surprising that people are disrupted in cases where they seriously, viscerally wonder “Hey, is everything I know and everything humanity has ever been doing to maybe-end, and also to maybe become any number of unimaginably awesome things? Also, am I personally in a position of possibly incredibly high leverage and yet also very high ambiguity with respect to all that?”</p>
<p>Perhaps it is more surprising that people in fact sometimes let this into their system 1’s at all. Many do, though; including many (but certainly not all!) of those I would consider highly effective. At least, I’ve had many many conversations with people who seem viscerally affected by all this. Also, many people who tell me AI risk is “only abstract to [them]” still burst into tears or otherwise exhibit unambiguous strong emotion when asked certain questions—so I think people are sometimes more affected than they think.</p>
<p>An additional point is that many folks over the years have told me that they were choosing not to think much about Singularity scenarios lest such thinking destabilize them in various ways. I suspect that many who are in principle capable of doing useful technical work on AI alignment presently avoid the topic for such reasons. Also, many such folks have told me over the years that they found pieces at CFAR that allowed them to feel more confident in attempting such thinking, and that finding these pieces then caused them to go forth and attempt such thinking. (Alas, I know of at least one person who later reported that they had been <em>inaccurate</em> in revising this risk assessment! Caution seems recommended.)</p>
<p>Finally: people sometimes suggest to me that researchers could dodge this whole set of difficulties by simply reasoning about Singularity scenarios abstractly, while avoiding ever letting such scenarios get into their viscera. While I expect such attempts are in fact useful to some, I believe this method insufficient for two reasons. First, as noted, it seems to me that these topics sometimes get under people’s skin more than they intend or realize. Second, it seems to me that visceral engagement with the AI alignment problem is often helpful for the best scientific research—if a person is to work with a given “puzzle” it is easier to do so when they can concretely picture the puzzle, including in their system 1. This is why mathematicians often take pains to “understand why a given theorem is true” rather than only to follow its derivation abstractly. This is why Richard Feynman took pains to picture the physics he was working with in the “make your beliefs pay rent in anticipated experiences” sense and took pains to ensure that his students could link phrases such as “materials with an index of refraction” with examples such as “water.” I would guess that with AI alignment research, as elsewhere, it is easier to do first-rate scientific work when you have visceral models of what the terms, claims, and puzzles mean and how it all fits together.</p>
<p>In terms of the tractability of assisting with disorientation in such cases: it seems to me that simply providing contexts for people to talk to folks who’ve “been there before” can be pretty helpful. I believe various other concepts we have are also helpful, such as: familiarity with what bucket errors often look like for AI risk newcomers; discussion of the unilateralist’s curse; explanations of why hobbies and world-modeling and honesty still matter when the stakes are high. (Certainly participants sometimes say that these are helpful.) The assistance is partial, but there’s a decent iteration loop for tinkering away at it. We’ll also be trying some LessWrong posts on some of this in the coming year.</p>
<h2>A cluster of “reality-masking” puzzles that also shaped CFAR</h2>
<p>To what extent has CFAR’s art been shaped by reality-masking puzzles—tinkering loops that inadvertently disable parts of our ability to see? And how can we tell, and how can we reduce such loops? And what role have reality-masking puzzles played in the disruption that sometimes happens to folks who get into AI risk (in and out of CFAR)?</p>
<p>My guess is actually that a fair bit of this sort of reality-masking has occurred. (My guess is that the amount is “strategically significant” but not “utterly overwhelming.”) To name one of the more important dynamics:</p>
<p><em><strong>Disabling pieces of the epistemic immune system</strong></em></p>
<p>Folks arrive with piles of heuristics that help them avoid nonsense beliefs and rash actions. Unfortunately, many of these heuristics—including many of the generally useful ones—can “get in the way.” They “get in the way” of thinking about AI risk. They also “get in the way” of folks at mainline workshops thinking about changing jobs/relationships/life patterns etc. unrelated to AI risk. And so disabling them can sometimes help people acquire accurate beliefs about important things, and have more felt freedom to change their lives in ways they want.</p>
<p>Thus, the naive process of tinkering toward “really helping this person think about AI risk” (or “really helping this person consider their life options and make choices”) can lead to folks disabling parts of their epistemic immune system. (And unfortunately also thereby disabling their future ability to detect certain classes of false claims!)</p>
<p>For example, the Sequences make some effort to disable:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/P792Z4QA9dzcLdKkE/absurdity-heuristic-absurdity-bias"">The absurdity heuristic</a></li>
<li>The habit of saying/believing one “<a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Pm83rA8MTYYeR4Ci4/i-don-t-know"">doesn’t know</a>” in cases where one hasn’t much “legitimate” evidence</li>
<li><a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Compartmentalization"">Compartmentalization</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Similarly, CFAR workshops sometimes have the effect of disabling:</p>
<ul>
<li>Taste as a fixed guide to which people/organizations/ideas to take in or to spit out. (People come in believing that certain things just “are” yucky. Then, we teach them how to “dialog” with their tastes… and they become more apt to sometimes-ignore previous “yuck” reactions.)</li>
<li>Antibodies that protect people from updating toward optimizing for a specific goal, rather than for a portfolio of goals. For example, entering participants will say things like “I know it’s not rational, but I also like to [activity straw vulcans undervalue].” And even though CFAR workshops explicitly warn against straw vulcanism, they also explicitly encourage people to work toward having goals that are more internally consistent, which sometimes has the effect of disabling the antibody which prevents people from suddenly re-conceptualizing most of their goal set as all being instrumental to/in service of some particular purportedly-paramount goal.</li>
<li>Folks’ tendency to take actions based on social roles (e.g., CFAR’s Goal-Factoring class used to explicitly teach people not to say “I’m studying for my exam because I’m a college student” or “I have to do it because it’s my job,” and to instead say “I’m studying for my exam in order to [cause outcome X]”).</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, these particular shifts are not all bad; many of them have advantages. But I think their costs are easy to underestimate, and I’m interested in seeing whether we can get a “rationality” that causes less disablement of ordinary human patterns of functioning, while still helping people reason well in contexts where there aren’t good prexisting epistemic guardrails. CFAR seems likely to spend a good bit of time modeling these problems over the coming year, and trying to develop candidate solutions—we’re already playing with a bunch of new curriculum designed primarily for this purpose—and we’d love to get LessWrong’s thoughts before playing further!</p>

<p>I think I did not spell out well enough what I mean by ""reality-masking puzzles."" I try again in <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/byewoxJiAfwE6zpep/reality-revealing-and-reality-masking-puzzles#FDquCKpM7akNYSjRw"">a comment</a>.</p>
<p>I think that getting this ontology right is a core and difficult task, and one I haven't finished solving yet -- it is the task of finding analogs of the ""reasoning vs rationalization"" distinction that are suitable for understanding group dynamics. I would love help with this task -- that is maybe the main reason I wrote this post.</p>
<p>I think this task is closely related to what Zvi and the book ""Moral Mazes"" are trying for.</p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">This post deals with the goal of avoiding or escaping being trapped in an immoral maze, accepting that for now we are trapped in a society that contains powerful mazes. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">We will not discuss methods of improving conditions (or preventing the worsening of conditions) within a maze, beyond a brief note on what a CEO might do. For a middle manager anything beyond not making the problem worse is exceedingly difficult. Even for the CEO this is an extraordinarily difficult task.   </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">To rescue society as a whole requires collectively fighting back. We will consider such options in  later posts.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">For now, the problem statement is hard enough.</span></p>
<h3><b>To reiterate the main personal-level takeaway</b></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;""><a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2020/01/10/what-is-success-in-an-immoral-maze/"">Being in a maze is not worth it.</a> They couldn&#8217;t pay you enough. Even if they could, they definitely don&#8217;t. If you end up CEO, </span><i><span style=""font-weight:400;"">you still lose</span></i><span style=""font-weight:400;"">. These lives are not worth it. Do not be a middle manager at a major corporation or other organization that works like this. Do not sell your soul.</span></p>
<p><span id=""more-20746""></span></p>
<h3>Problem statement</h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">Increasingly, avoiding mazes is easier said than done. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">First, one must identify them, for which the previous post offers a guide. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">After that, there are still many hard problems to solve. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">How do we avoid moral mazes? How do we justify that choice to others? What alternative choices do we have? What if we&#8217;re already in a maze? What if we&#8217;ve already self-modified in ways that make it hard to extract ourselves? What if our human or social capital only pays off inside them? </span></p>
<p>What about if you are doing object-level work without anyone who reports to you, but you have a maze above you?</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">And for those who think this way, do I have a moral obligation to suffer and do this anyway, in order to maximize my charitable giving, or to otherwise do good?</span></p>
<h3><b>How do we avoid immoral mazes?</b></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">Truly understand how painful it will be to interact with a maze even if you&#8217;re not an employee. Know the signs, as discussed in the previous post. <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2020/01/12/how-to-identify-an-immoral-maze/"">Keep a close eye out for mazes.</a> Realize that you have other options. Choose other paths. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">This isn&#8217;t an &#8216;all things being equal&#8217; choose other paths. This is making what </span><i><span style=""font-weight:400;"">look </span></i><span style=""font-weight:400;"">like major sacrifices and different life choices and profession choices, or taking big risks (that may or may not include starting a business or doing work outside of an organization) in order to have skin in the game. Really understand that the offer from even a relatively tolerable maze is much, much worse than it looks, and that opportunities outside mazes are often much better and more realistic than they look.</span></p>
<p>Young people starting out in the labor market often have The Fear that they will never find a job or never find a good job or another good job. If you are capable of getting this far, and you persevere, that is not true for you. A wide variety of jobs and other opportunities are out there.</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">I realize some people have already become so trapped in mazes that they cannot walk away. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">If you actually can&#8217;t walk away, see the last two questions.</span></p>
<h3><b>What do you do if you find yourself inside a maze?</b></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">Quit. Seriously. Go do something else. Ideally, do it today. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">At least start planning and looking. Every day there is another day you suffer, another day you invest your social and human capital in ways that can’t be transferred, and another day you become infected by the maze that much more. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">If you actually can&#8217;t afford to quit, see the last three questions.</span></p>
<h3><b>How do we justify our choice to others?</b></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">When I worked for a financial firm, the question ‘what do you do?’ (or, in a scarier form, ‘who are you?’ as implicitly defined by your job) had an easy answer. I work for (firm). One of the big benefits was being able to tell an easy, compact story of me and my life and work choices, that most found praiseworthy. It was easy. It was </span><i><span style=""font-weight:400;"">comfortable.</span></i><span style=""font-weight:400;""> It also worked wonders for things like renting an apartment or otherwise proving myself respectable. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">A lot of the alternative answers that don’t involve mazes give you a much better life and method of earning a living, but they do make answering the ‘what do you do?’ and ‘how can I count on you to make rent or support a family?’ questions trickier. One must acknowledge this. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">It isn’t only strangers you tell this story to. It is your friends. It is your family. It is also yourself.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">I likely stayed at (firm) months longer than I should have due to being scared of not being able to tell this story anymore, especially to my wife and to myself, and having to instead tell a different one.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">A lot of this fear is the expectation that others won’t understand and won’t accept our justifications. That does happen, but <i>far less than people typically expect or fear</i></span><i><span style=""font-weight:400;"">. </span></i><span style=""font-weight:400;"">Most people are far more sympathetic than the inside view might suggest. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">Even the internet is supportive. Which is not its style.</span><span style=""font-weight:400;""><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">This is largely because, at least for now, there is a widespread cultural belief that one should do what you love, and be content in one&#8217;s work. That work should provide meaning. That&#8217;s not always a good rule or good idea, although it is a fine aspiration. Not everyone can have soul in the game. But almost everyone recognizes that it would be better if one did. </span></p>
<h3><strong>How do you go about telling your new story? (Justification continued)</strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">Here’s my take on how to approach this, based on my experience. Comments suggesting improvements or alternatives are highly encouraged. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">There are two parts of this. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">One is to figure out what you </span><i><span style=""font-weight:400;"">are </span></i><span style=""font-weight:400;"">doing, not only what you’re </span><i><span style=""font-weight:400;"">not </span></i><span style=""font-weight:400;"">doing, and how to talk about that. Some of those answers are mostly culturally normal and comfortable, some of them are less so. Now that I can say ‘I’m a game designer’ that goes over quite well. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">The most important things here are to make the thing you are doing sound </span><i><span style=""font-weight:400;"">simple, </span></i><span style=""font-weight:400;"">put it in terms that people can relate to, and to make it clear that you are comfortable and happy with it to the extent that this wouldn’t be lying to people. If you’re not comfortable and happy with it, people will pounce on that. It&#8217;s also much better to be happy with what you are doing for your own sake, so that is something to work on, either looking to get to that place, or to finding another option where you can do that. </span></p>
<p>If you quit today without a plan, then what you will be doing is recovering from your experience and figuring out what to do next. I told that story for about a month. That story goes over better than you would expect &#8211; for a while. From a social (as well as financial) perspective you are most definitely on a clock. There are plenty of people who let that clock run out. But if it&#8217;s two weeks in, own it.</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">The other part of your explanation is justifying why you’re not doing the standard thing of indenturing yourself to a new maze, unless you have an obviously great alternative thing going. The worse your answer to part one sounds, the harder part two is going to be. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">First try giving it to them straight. Tell them you find large corporations highly toxic and morally compromising. It left you a wreck. You have no interest in the lifestyle you would live or the person that you would be. If they are genuinely curious, you can point them to <em>Moral Mazes</em> itself or this series of posts, or explain further in your own words. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">You can also use the culturally assigned incantations to explain your decision. Tell people you need to do what you are passionate about, to ‘follow your heart/passion,’ to do what you believe in, to ‘help people’ or ‘make a difference.’ To ‘get your hands dirty’ and ‘do something real.’ Some people appreciate wanting to ‘be your own boss’ or ‘do it your way,’ which are weaker, non-dystopian ways of sending the real message. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">And of course, you can simply say ‘it was making me miserable. I hated it. Doing this instead makes me happy.’</span></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve gotten into the habit of saying my job at (firm) was &#8216;a poor fit&#8217; because I genuinely believe both that there were particular real needs they have that were expensive for me to provide, and that the firm was in many ways unusually great and unusually low on maze characteristics, and I do not think it is a mistake to take a job there if it would suit you. They treated me right and I don&#8217;t want to throw anyone under the bus.</p>
<p>You <em>could </em>also, if you wanted to, use the question as an opportunity to do a public service and spread the word. That&#8217;s supererogatory.</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">Another thing to keep in mind, as discussed in the next question, is that those pushing us towards mazes are often operating on traditions and heuristics that used to push towards virtuous action that led to happiness and real success. The world changed, and those traditions and heuristics started getting this wrong. This is highly sympathetic. It might help to approach from this perspective.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">Most people get it. They don’t </span><i><span style=""font-weight:400;"">fully </span></i><span style=""font-weight:400;"">get it unless they’ve been on in the inside and reflected upon what happened. But they do get that there’s something soul-killing about working for the man and/or being lost in a maze of political actions. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">Others won’t get it. </span></p>
<h3><b>What if my family or culture won’t accept my justifications?</b></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">Some people won’t get it. They will respond that all of this is excuses for not wanting to do hard work or make sacrifices. That this is how the &#8216;real world&#8217; works. That it is &#8216;time to grow up.&#8217; That a ‘real adult/man/woman/hero/whomever’ would suck it up and deal with it. That it is your responsibility to do so, for your family, for the world or for yourself. That ‘get a steady job’ is what good and responsible people do. That this is how one survives in today’s world, and how one gets to raise and support a family. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">Often people who are counting on you, usually family members, will effectively let you know that while they care a non-zero amount about whether your life experience is miserable, or what impact your work has on the world, or what upside or opportunities for personal growth you might have, what they </span><i><span style=""font-weight:400;"">actually </span></i><span style=""font-weight:400;"">care about is whether you are projecting the illusion of security. They want to mentally cache that you/they ‘are going to be OK’ and that ‘everything is all right.’ </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">This has remarkably little to do with actual security. Jobs in many mazes are not especially secure. Others are secure barring disruption of the underlying order, if you are willing to pay the prices discussed, and tie all your human and social capital to the maze. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">The security they seek is the security of the banker who loses money when everyone around him loses money. This is useful to the banker because one cannot then scapegoat and fire him if he has bad luck and does poorly. This is useful to those in a maze and those who tie their fates to them, because they hope they will similarly seem responsible and legitimate, and thus worthy of sympathy and assistance if things go poorly. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">It is a self-reinforcing charade. People demand this illusion of legitimacy to protect against others’ accusations of illegitimacy. They will defend this charade even if times change, the mazes mostly fail and those who are doing real things succeed, and attempt to forcibly transfer wealth from people doing real things to those who previously worked in mazes. All of that doesn’t make participation in the charade worthless. You can even hope to benefit from the expropriations. But it is important to know that it is a charade. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">If you face a family and/or culture that demands devotion of one’s entire life to the illusion of respectability, have sympathy for those making these demands. In the past, when these traditions and heuristics developed, the illusion of respectability corresponded to real work and other worthy virtues that lead to happiness and true success. If they fail to realize the change, and update accordingly, that is at least somewhat understandable. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">If attempts to make them realize this change or accept your perspective fail, one must treat them the same way one treats anything else that is </span><a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/09/23/out-to-get-you/""><span style=""font-weight:400;"">out to get you</span></a><span style=""font-weight:400;"">. If their demands cannot be satisfied in a way you can accept, because they will simply demand more until it is something you cannot accept, then attempting to satisfy their demands is folly. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">If you previously chose those around you based upon being a member of a maze, then it is plausible that having invested in those people and relationships it makes sense to stick around. It is also plausible that being around them afterwards no longer makes sense. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">I know it is easy to say and tough to act upon, but hopefully in time either they will understand and/or come around, or you will realize that life is better without them. </span></p>
<h3><b>What if you&#8217;ve already self-modified too much?</b></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">This sucks quite a lot. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">After a while, those little status differences and little battles start to deeply matter. Other things matter less and less. Humans can adapt to many things. Giving up all that likely fills you with deep existential dread.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">Even worse, you&#8217;ve sculpted everything else, including your friends and often your family, around these obsessions. You, and often they, depend on the currently steady money <em>and the illusion of security </em>the maze provides. Without that, things could rapidly fall apart. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">The good news is, you&#8217;ve figured out that this happened. Perhaps you haven&#8217;t self-modified as much as you&#8217;ve feared, or you have a path back to undoing this. Often the modifications start reverting once you extract yourself from the situation. Often you&#8217;re deeply miserable, in a way that those around you at least subconsciously know quite well. Those around you often realize this long before the person realizes it about themselves. If you tell the people you care about what&#8217;s really going on, if they&#8217;re worth keeping, they&#8217;ll almost always be supportive. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">I&#8217;ve seen a number of people realize they hated their jobs and needed to go. Almost all of them got lots of support when they got the courage to say it out loud.</span></p>
<p>A note I got on a previous draft: &#8220;The happiest Uber drivers I have seen used to be middle management.&#8221;</p>
<p>If anything, I see many people around me being <em>too supportive </em>of opting out of working, or in a sense out of life, entirely. <span style=""font-weight:400;"">It is important to help and encourage people to do more things.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">See the question above on how to explain your choices and situation to others. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">So my first suggestion is to admit to yourself what is happening to you. Take an inventory. Concretely observe </span><i><span style=""font-weight:400;"">what is actually going on around you, </span></i><span style=""font-weight:400;"">without excuses or euphemisms, and what that is doing to your brain and your life. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">Then </span><i><span style=""font-weight:400;"">tell the people who care about you. </span></i><span style=""font-weight:400;"">And go from there.</span></p>
<h3><b>Are mazes are where our human and/or social capital pays off?</b></h3>
<p>Note that when I say &#8216;pays off&#8217; here, I mean <em>maximally </em>pays off. If you have the skills and opportunity to advance inside a maze, you have the skills and opportunity to take a lower level position at a smaller institution, and still earn a reasonable living. That does not mean that this transition would not be painful, or that you could maintain your current lifestyle, or that your family and friends would stand by you, <em>but you definitely have that option.</em></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">If you are an academic with a PhD, and notice your academic institution is a maze, keep in mind that the entire concern about you only getting paid off in academia probably </span><i><span style=""font-weight:400;"">simply isn&#8217;t true</span></i><span style=""font-weight:400;"">. Academics typically get substantial pay bumps when they move to private industry. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">A lot of other professionals are similarly buying the security and familiarity of what they&#8217;re used to, rather than being paid off with dollars. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">One must still be careful to ensure not to jump from one maze into another.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">Then there&#8217;s big corporations. Big corporations <em>really do</em> pay better than smaller businesses if you can&#8217;t get equity in either business. The recent history of domestic &#8216;income inequality&#8217; is in large part inequality </span><i><span style=""font-weight:400;"">between firms </span></i><span style=""font-weight:400;"">as bigger and more successful firms pay higher salaries even to their lower tiers, and have more higher tiers in which to earn yet more.</span></p>
<p>There are three theories I know about for why big corporations pay more.</p>
<p>Theory one is that big corporations are more likely to have <a href=""https://notendur.hi.is/ajonsson/kennsla/O-ring.pdf"">O-ring production functions</a> or otherwise benefit more from higher quality workers, so they pay more in order to attract better workers.</p>
<p>Theory two is that big corporations make more money per employee, and are big enough to potentially support unions, so employees demand and receive more of that pay.</p>
<p>Theory three is that working in a big corporation sucks, and employees realize this to at least some extent, so employees demand more money in order to be willing to work there.</p>
<p>If working at a major corporation is a major life cost, and working in management a bigger one, and these come with higher pay, than a lot of income inequality in developed countries does not represent a gap in desired life outcomes, and it might be <em>more unfair </em>if that part of the gap was closed.</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">A lot more of that pay gap is that some professions engage in rent seeking behavior to extract resources. Some big examples are finance, law, education/academia, and medicine. Again, that comes with much better pay.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">It also usually comes with a big time investment in the development of the relevant social capital, human capital and credentials you need to succeed. If you went to medical school or law school or worked hard to get a tenure track, and later realize that your profession is a maze (I&#8217;m making no claim here that these professions are or aren&#8217;t mazes in general or how intense those mazes might be, although some central organizations within them clearly are very intense mazes), walking away from that is going to be expensive.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">This is doubly true for human capital </span><i><span style=""font-weight:400;"">within a single organization. </span></i><span style=""font-weight:400;"">When I took a job at a financial firm, they spent a large part of my first </span><i><span style=""font-weight:400;"">two years </span></i><span style=""font-weight:400;"">training me. The first year had a lot of firm-specific detail but was mostly training about markets and trading in general, that applies everywhere there are markets. It was fascinating, and pretty great. Five stars, would study again, especially given they paid me rather than the other way around. The second year still had a lot of training and learning, but increasingly it was about the specific problems I was working on, developing relationships with and learning about coworkers and organizational structures and how we did things, and other information specific to the firm. This was less fun, and when I left, it became worthless.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">I had another job I stayed in for five years. This was also a place I got to observe transition from mostly not being a maze into becoming one over time, although that&#8217;s a story I can&#8217;t tell online. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">Early on there was a lot of learning, a lot of which was very specific to our business, but a lot of which applies universally. I worked mainly with one particular person, who knew what we were doing and cared about us doing it well. It provided great experience. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">By the third year, I was learning about our specific products and customers and dynamics, in increasingly arcane fashion. I was also forced to interact increasingly with the maze growing around us, spending more time making bosses and others like what they saw rather than doing what was right for the business. I was unable to get the resources to enhance our performance, despite yearly returns on investment obviously well above 100%. I made an effort to switch over into problems that were both more valuable and offered more room for growth, both for me and for the business, and which I could tackle with the resources available. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">By the fifth year, I wasn&#8217;t developing any skills that would be useful elsewhere, except that I was now learning to code because I got tired of no one being able to code what I needed. This brought me from &#8216;can code but not in an actually useful way&#8217; to &#8216;can code real things that are useful, but badly/slowly.&#8217; </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">Note that the managers in Moral Mazes who succeed were always moving around to bigger and better things. If they weren&#8217;t, they instead moved on to similar and different thus hard to compare things to preserve the illusion of career momentum. If you have adopted the maze nature, many of the skills you have learned doing so translate to other mazes. Your existing within-maze status can often also be transferred to your new location, but only if you continue to be seen as a winner. If you&#8217;re a loser, no one else will want you, and moving on will mean moving down.</span></p>
<p>That means that once your path in the maze is stalled, even though you have invested a lot to get to this point, recovering your momentum is going to be extremely difficult. If you are not satisfied with your current role, your human capital is a lot less valuable than it naively appears to be, because it no longer has much upside even on its own terms. The fall from where you are to starting over can still be large.</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">The best feature of an academic maze is that they have a perfectly designed system in which to not care about getting ahead, which The Gervais Principle calls a loser, and which academia calls tenure.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">The pattern remains. The more you dedicate time to a path, both a profession and a particular job, the more you give up when you leave and the less of your time you can carry with you. Many people don&#8217;t have great options. The job market isn&#8217;t that great out there if you don&#8217;t want to be coding and don&#8217;t have an in with the rent seekers, and can&#8217;t use the skills you&#8217;ve developed, or do the thing that legibly follows from your resume.</span><span style=""font-weight:400;""><br />
</span></p>
<h3>If mazes are where my social and/or human capital pays off, what should I do?</h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">Let us ignore here </span><i><span style=""font-weight:400;"">why </span></i><span style=""font-weight:400;"">your capital pays off best in a maze</span><span style=""font-weight:400;"">. It does not much matter to your decision, in important senses, to what extent rent seeking, theft, coercion, fraud or even systems designed explicitly to make your skills not transfer to honest work are or aren&#8217;t responsible for this being the case. For whatever reason, often events conspire to prevent you from efficiently plying your trade (or in some cases, plying it at all), where you hold comparative advantage, without being part of a maze. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">Some people really do have a dilemma, where they can either do something menial and mindless that still gets them abused and doesn&#8217;t pay much, if they can find work at all. Or they can go out on a limb that looks super risky and likely to fail, and/or that requires years without compensation. Or they can keep working in the maze.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">It is important that </span><i><span style=""font-weight:400;"">vastly more people </span></i><b><i>think </i></b><i><span style=""font-weight:400;"">they are in this position, than </span></i><b><i>are </i></b><i><span style=""font-weight:400;"">in this position. </span></i><span style=""font-weight:400;"">If you think you are in this position, consider the possibility that you are mistaken. Consider all the alternatives. Consider how much the reduction in medium-term funds and superficial status would actually matter to you. Consider how much of what&#8217;s holding you back is simply The Fear in some form.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">Imagine exactly how relieved you&#8217;d be to be out of there. Remember that </span><i><span style=""font-weight:400;"">even if leaving really is super painful, </span></i><span style=""font-weight:400;"">involving a large reduction in consumption levels and superficial status and standard of living, and the abandonment of large sunk costs, that doesn&#8217;t mean it isn&#8217;t Worth It. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">My first line of response to this dilemma is exactly what you would expect: </span><i><span style=""font-weight:400;"">Consider leaving anyway. </span></i><span style=""font-weight:400;"">But I admit that isn&#8217;t </span><i><span style=""font-weight:400;"">always </span></i><span style=""font-weight:400;"">the right answer. In some cases, things really have gone too far, you have too many promises to keep and too many sunk costs.</span></p>
<h3>Become a Loser</h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">The next line of defense is to </span><i><span style=""font-weight:400;"">become a loser, </span></i><span style=""font-weight:400;"">in the sense laid out in</span><a href=""https://www.ribbonfarm.com/the-gervais-principle/""> <span style=""font-weight:400;"">The Gervais Principle</span></a><span style=""font-weight:400;"">. A loser does not strive to get ahead while at work. A loser finds their value in other places than work. At work, they pride themselves on putting forward <em>at most </em>the minimum amount of effort to get the job done. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">The Gervais Principle can be seen as the prequel to <em>Moral Mazes, </em>dealing with life at lower levels of mazes that have to interact with the real world. Mazes need, as <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2019/05/30/quotes-from-moral-mazes/"">several quotes</a> describe, people who keep their heads down and &#8216;do their job&#8217; with no ambitions for further advancement. Ideally one does this as low on the totem pole as one can stomach and afford, as the life that results is far less odious and taxing. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">By declaring themselves as neutral and not a threat, such people are often left mostly alone if they&#8217;re important to the system continuing to run. They can now reclaim some slack and a personal life. It&#8217;s not a great solution. You&#8217;re still holding up the maze. You&#8217;re still interacting with it. You&#8217;ll still have to make severe moral sacrifices. But to some extent, some of the time, you can pick and choose what to have no part in. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">Over time, your position likely will slowly degrade. Eventually this may lead you to leave. Hopefully by then you&#8217;ll have been able to save enough and be prepared enough to be ready for that. If you&#8217;re stuck in a maze, the least you can do is turn a healthy monthly profit.</span></p>
<h3>Take Risks</h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">The final line of defense I can come up with is to take big bold risks. Either stand up for what you believe in or gamble to advance your own situation. Sometimes this will work, your situation will improve and you&#8217;ll learn your situation was better than you thought. Other times they&#8217;ll backfire, and you&#8217;ll learn your situation was worse than you thought and is now worse than that. Remember that if you get fired from a job you don&#8217;t want, that can be a big win, because you might not have had the courage to leave on your own and you might even get severance and unemployment. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">The real danger is often not that you get fired. It&#8217;s that you become &#8216;dead without knowing it&#8217; as in this quote:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style=""color:var(--color-text);"">You can put the damper on anyone who works for you very easily and that’s why there’s too much chemistry in the corporation. There’s not enough objective information about people. When you really want to do somebody in, you just say, well, he can’t get along with people. That’s a big one. And we do that constantly. What that means, by the way, is that he pissed me off; he gave evidence of his frustration with some situation. Another big one is that he can’t manage—he doesn’t delegate or he doesn’t make his subordinates keep his commitments. So in this sort of way, a consensus does build up about a person and a guy can be dead and not even know it. (Location 1475, Quote 10)</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">This can lead you to waste years of your life struggling for something you had no chance of getting. This is one reason why a great way to take risk is to force the issue, asking for or demanding raises or promotions. It avoids this danger. The more uncertain you are about where you stand, the more you should take risk to create clarity. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">At all my jobs in mazes, I would have greatly benefited from taking greater risks to create clarity, </span><i><span style=""font-weight:400;"">regardless of the outcome.</span></i></p>
<h3>Can You Change Things From the Top?</h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">If you by some miracle reach the top with your soul intact, now you can try and change the system. Or at least you can do harm reduction in earnest. One shouldn&#8217;t give this much hope or weight, since such intentions rarely survive that long, and doing anything lasting about it will still be quite hard. I don&#8217;t know what would work. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">My friends and I have talked to several people who have reached the top. Many of them understand what the process has done to them, but don&#8217;t know how to fix themselves or the system. It isn&#8217;t cheap or easy to reverse or even halt the damage.</span></p>
<p>It is unlikely you can have much impact without reaching the actual top and becoming CEO. If you do become CEO, you may have a short window in which you can &#8216;clean house&#8217; the way that maze CEOs do, and put people opposed to mazes into key positions where they can clean their houses in turn. You can then combine that with other efforts, and maybe get somewhere, but I don&#8217;t have the insights necessary to say much more, and such efforts will be exceedingly difficult. The maze will fight back.</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">I strongly believe it is much easier to build a new system from scratch than to ‘<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTTC_fD598A"">change the system from within</a>.’</span></p>
<h3><strong>What about if you are doing object-level work without anyone who reports to you, but you have a maze above you?</strong></h3>
<p>In <em>Moral Mazes </em>such workers are said to be &#8216;on the line.&#8217;</p>
<p>Details of this situation will determine to what extent this represents being stuck in the maze, versus to what extent this represents doing regular object-level work.</p>
<p>What are you actually doing all day? What are your incentives?</p>
<p>If your essential scenario is <em>given an object-level job to do and do it, </em>that is mostly fine.</p>
<p>If your essential scenario is not that, it is less fine, but it is still far better than being a middle manager. It&#8217;s not <em>good </em>to have a bull**** job, but it&#8217;s not the nightmare we&#8217;re describing elsewhere.</p>
<p>Consider the car salesmen from <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2019/12/30/imperfect-competition/"">Imperfect Competition</a>.</p>
<p>One can imagine a car dealership as no different from the local hardware store, buying useful tools wholesale and selling them at a higher price to customers who want to buy and use those tools, and the only difference is that you sell 0.1% as many tools for a thousand times the price. One can also imagine that the demands of the car corporation, and the incentives they provide, and the misinformation they spread, and the regulations they twist and engineer, and so forth, end up with you effectively stuck in the maze. The truth is presumably somewhere in between &#8211; you see insane things around quotas and regulations and advertising campaigns you cannot control, and the dealerships have their own issues of their own design, but you are still mostly working for a small actual business most of the time.</p>
<p>The same would go for the workers in The Office, as analyzed in The Gervais Principle. Michael is largely in maze hell. Jim spends a lot of time avoiding maze hell. Most of the workers have to deal with the craziness and what it does to the business, but this is only ordinary soul crushing and not what middle managers deal with.</p>
<p>Jim&#8217;s situation on The Office is the biggest problem. There is no future. The only way up, to better your work situation, would be to dive into the maze. If you do that while not buying into the system, it will go badly for you on all levels. If you do buy in, then you&#8217;ve fully made the big mistake I&#8217;m warning against.</p>
<p>Consider the Uber drivers, some of whom are reported to be happy refugees from middle management.</p>
<p>To the extent that the driver is offered rides, chooses to accept them individually, and gets paid for each ride provided, the driver is good. They set their hours and level of effort. There is word that Uber and its ilk are now using algorithmic systems and various overall incentives to try and ensnare their drivers more broadly into the system, which would be worse, but the core experience is still one of real work.</p>
<p>Consider a software engineer, given specific tasks to code and coding them. That seems likely to be mostly fine.</p>
<p>Consider a worker that is literally &#8216;on the line&#8217; in a manufacturing plant that makes physical objects. It is not the best or most compensated work, but you are mostly free from the maze.</p>
<p>Being &#8216;on the line&#8217; and continuing to do real work is miles behind doing real work where you have skin in the game, but if you get to dodge the worst of all this, it is a reasonable temporary fallback if you lack alternatives. Look carefully at details.</p>
<p>If you are a manager but not a middle manager (e.g. no one who reports to you has anyone who reports to them), and the group of people you manage has object-level tasks to do together, you aren&#8217;t automatically doomed, but there is great danger lurking, including the risk you will be promoted.</p>

In it, sex causes people to attach to each other emotionally, but decreasingly with successive partners, just like tape is sticky, but less sticky when reused.  Therefore, they say, you should avoid premarital sex because it will make you less attached to your eventual spouse.</p><p>Do you think this is a reasonable summary of human sexuality?  Are people basically scotch tape?</p><p>Suppose the postscript had been: therefore you should have lots of premarital sex, so that you&apos;re not irrationally attached to someone.  That way, when you believe you are in love and ready to commit, you really are.</p><p>Does this change your views on the scotch tape model?  For many people, it does.</p><p>If so, then your views on the model are not driven by your analysis of its own merits, but by either your desire to have premarital sex, or your reluctance to admit Abstinence Educators could ever be right about anything.</p><p>(Or, possibly, your emotional revulsion at premarital sex or your affiliation to Abstinence Educators.  The point of this section is unaffected.)</p><p>The point here is to break the argument into the piece to be evaluated, and the consequence of that piece which logically shouldn&apos;t effect the first part&apos;s validity but somehow does.</p><p>If the consequences seem hard to spin backwards, put on your Complete Monster Hat for a quick role-play.  Suppose you think third-world charity is breaking the economies it goes to, and therefore you should keep your money for yourself, but this could be a rationalization from an unendorsed value (greed).  Imagine yourself as a Dick Dastardly, a mustache-twirling villain who&apos;s trying to maximize suffering.  Does Mr. Dastardly give generously to charity?  Probably not.</p><p>I don&apos;t want to get into an analysis of economic aid here.  If contemplating Mr Dastardly gives you a more complex result like &quot;I should stop treating all third-world economic aid as equivalent&quot; and not a simple &quot;I should give&quot;, then the intuition pump is <em>working as intended</em>.  Because it&apos;s helping you build a more accurate world-model.</p><h1>Conservation of Expected Evidence</h1><p>The examples in the original <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/jiBFC7DcCrZjGmZnJ/conservation-of-expected-evidence"">Conservation of Expected Evidence post</a>  cover this pretty well.</p><p>To put it in imperative terms, imagine you&apos;d observed the opposite.  If you wouldn&apos;t update the opposite way, something has gone wrong.  If you wouldn&apos;t update as much, this must be balanced by having been surprised when you learned this.</p><p>Note that &quot;opposite&quot; can be a little subtle.  There can be u-shaped response curves, where &quot;too little&quot; and &quot;too much&quot; are both signs of badness, and only &quot;just right&quot; updates you in favor of something.  But unless such a curve is well-known beforehand, the resulting model takes a complexity penalty.</p><h1>Ask a Friend</h1><p>A classic way of dealing with flaws in your own thinking is to get someone else&apos;s thinking.</p><p>Ideally someone with uncorrelated biases.  This is easiest to find when you have a personal connection weighing on your reasoning, and it&apos;s easy to find someone without one.  (In extreme cases, this can be recusal: make the unconnected person do all the work.)</p><p>Be careful when asking that you don&apos;t distort the evidence as you present it.  Verbosity is your friend here.</p><p>You may even find that your friend doesn&apos;t need to say anything.  When you reach the weak-point in your argument, you&apos;ll feel it.</p><h2>One&apos;s Never Alone with a Rubber Duck</h2><p>If your friend doesn&apos;t need to say anything, maybe they don&apos;t need to be there.  Programmers refer to this as &quot;rubber duck debugging&quot;.</p><p>This has the advantage that your friend can be whomever you want.  You can&apos;t actually run your ideas past Richard Feynman for a double-checking, for several reasons, but you can certainly run them past imaginary Richard Feynman.  The ideal person for this is someone whose clear thinking you respect, and whose respect you want (as this will throw your social instincts into the fray at finding flaws).</p><p>Be sure, if attempting this that you explain your <em>entire</em> argument.  In imagination, it&apos;s possible to fast-forward through the less interesting parts, but those could easily be where the flaw is.</p><hr class=""dividerBlock""><p>Next: <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Fbgi77gaK5tfWdLRY/using-expert-disagreement"">Using Expert Disagreement</a> </p>",dspeyer,dspeyer,dspeyer,

As that task quickly became overwhelming, I decided to break it down into smaller posts that ensure I cover each of the cases and mechanisms that I intended to.</em></p><p><em>Overall, I think the trade-off between the alignment of agents and the competence of agents can explain a lot of problems to which people often think there are simple answers. The less capable an agent is (whether the agent is a person, a bureaucracy, or an algorithm) the easier it is for a principal to assess the agent, and ensure the agent is working toward the principal&#x2019;s goals. As agents become more competent, they become both more capable of actually accomplishing the principal&#x2019;s goals and of merely appearing to accomplish the principal&#x2019;s goals while pursuing their own. In debating policy changes, I often find one sided arguments that neglect this trade-off, and in general I think efforts to improve policies or the bureaucratic structures of companies, non-profits, and governments should be informed by it.</em></p><hr class=""dividerBlock""><p>Part 1:</p><p>Virtue signaling and moralistic anger are both forces that have been useful for holding people accountable, and powerful mechanisms of cultural evolution: spreading some norms more successfully than others, and resulting in many societies holding similar norms.</p><p>However, the larger a group becomes, the less members of the group know on average about other individual member&#x2019;s behavior or the consequences of it: making it harder to evaluate complex actions. This in turn gives an advantage to more clear forms of signaling that are more inefficient and costly than those that could be sustainable in smaller groups.</p><p>Examples:</p><ul><li>While it would be efficient for a politician to accept money from competing special interest groups and to keep their behavior consistent with their constituents regardless, it is simpler for politicians to convince allies they aren&#x2019;t corrupt by not accepting money from political opponents at all.</li><li>With more complex tax codes, governments can implement more economically efficient <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigovian_tax"">pigouvian taxes</a> which increase economic growth by concentrating more and more of the tax burden on actions which produce negative externalities for others. However, the power to assess and tax negative externalities gives those that influence tax code the opportunity to shape tax code to their own advantage at the expense of others.</li><li>While a police officer could accept bribes and enforce the law anyway, unless you have a lot of information on the officer, you wouldn&#x2019;t be convinced that there weren&#x2019;t cases the officer was looking the other way. Likewise, people probably don&#x2019;t trust the objectivity of police departments with the power of civil asset forfeiture even if such power can be used to reduce the tax burden of police and to create stronger deterrent effects on crime.</li><li>More pacifistic states are more credible in not holding hostile expansionist intentions, than defensive states, who are in turn more credible than states that take offensive or pre-emptive action.&#xA0;</li><li>It is simpler for someone to be vegan than to try explaining a series of edge cases about animal welfare/consciousness or a strategy of eating meat when it doesn&#x2019;t increase demand for meat. It would also look pretty suspicious for vegans to try selling wasted meat, even though doing so would undercut meat producers.</li><li>It may be more efficient for you to work from home or to shift your hours on fairly autonomous work to match times you are more productive, but generally employers require explanations, and seek to avoid giving their employees room to slack off.</li><li>Nepotistic hiring enables employers to ensure the alignment of employees, via additional information on prospective employees and leverage on their social capital. More meritocratic hiring is more ideal for society, however, the more candidates there are to assess the harder it becomes to investigate the merit of each.&#xA0; Accordingly, the larger a competing population of candidates is, the more their education will become focused on winning signaling competitions, and the less it will become focused on gaining skills that are difficult to demonstrate quickly.</li></ul><p>In summary there are a lot of actions that are more directly efficient and selfishly beneficial for those that do them, but because they are not credible signals of good intent/are excuses that the corrupt would use, the options are not sustainable in larger societies. Small groups where people know each other well on the other hand can allow weirder norms to be sustainable without corruption due to their increased ability to vet each other. This may also explain why smaller groups in history often had more sustainable norms of exploiting defectors or outsiders which wouldn&#x2019;t be sustainable in larger societies since you can&#x2019;t tell if someone is robbing a thief or an innocent person. Reducing attempts at exploitation between small competing groups of insiders is likewise probably a good thing for scaling up societies.</p><p>In general, these signaling costs come from scenarios where people&#x2019;s interests may not align, and the costs are paid to demonstrate alignment. Without efficient mechanisms to assess and vet each other, as groups scale they lose trust, and more costly signaling becomes required to sustain cooperation.	</p>",Gentzel,gentzel,Gentzel,

However, in some cases, such capacity races may actually be the globally optimal strategy. Below I try to explain this with some examples. <br />
<br />
1: If the U.S. kept racing in its military capacity after WW2, the U.S. may have been able to use its negotiating leverage to stop the Soviet Union from becoming a nuclear power: halting proliferation and preventing the build up of world threatening numbers of high yield weapons. Basically, the earlier you win an arms race, the less nasty it may be later. If the U.S. had won the cold war earlier, global development may have taken a very different course, with decades of cooperative growth instead of immense amounts of Soviet GDP being spent on defense, and ultimately causing its collapse. The principle: it may make sense to start an arms race if you think you are going to win if you start now, provided that a nastier arms race is inevitable later. </p>
<p><img src=""https://theconsequentialist.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/us_and_ussr_nuclear_stockpiles-svg.png?w=1140"" srcset=""https://theconsequentialist.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/us_and_ussr_nuclear_stockpiles-svg.png 400w, https://theconsequentialist.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/us_and_ussr_nuclear_stockpiles-svg.png?w=150 150w, https://theconsequentialist.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/us_and_ussr_nuclear_stockpiles-svg.png?w=300 300w"" /></p>
<p>2: If neither the U.S. nor Russia developed nuclear weapons at a quick pace, many more factions could have developed them later at a similar time, and this would be much more destabilizing and potentially violent than cases where there is a monopolar or a bipolar power situation. Principle: it is easier to generate stable coordination with small groups of actors than large groups. The more actors there are, the less likely <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction"">MAD</a> and treaties are to work, the earlier an arms race starts, the more prohibitively expensive it is for new groups to join the race. <br />
<br />
3: If hardware design is a bottleneck on the development of far more powerful artificial intelligence systems, then racing to figure out good algorithms now will let us test a lot more things before we get to the point a relatively bad set of algorithms can create an immense amount of harm due to the hardware it has at its disposal <a></a> (improbable example: imagine a Hitler emulation with the ability to think 1000x faster). Principle: the earlier you start an arms race, the more constrained you are by technological limits.<a href=""#bottom"">1</a></p>
<p>I do not necessarily think these arguments are decisive, but I do think it is worth figuring out what the likely alternatives are before deciding if engaging in a particular capacity race is a bad idea. In general:</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s nice for there to not be tons of violence and death from many factions fighting for power (multipolar situation)<br />
</li>
<li>It is nice to not have the future locked into a horrible direction by the first country/company/group/AI/etc. to effectively take over the world due some advantage derived from racing toward a technological advantage (singleton/monopolar power)</li>
<li>It’s nice for there to not be the constant risk of overwhelming suffering and death from a massive arms build up between two factions (bipolar situation)</li>
</ul>
<p>So if an arms race is good or not basically depends on if the “good guys” are going to win (and remain good guys). If not, racing just makes everyone spend more on potentially risky tech and less on helping people. <a href=""https://futureoflife.org/2019/04/02/fli-podcast-why-ban-lethal-autonomous-weapons/?cn-reloaded=1"">While some concerns about autonomous drones are legitimate</a> and they may make individuals much more powerful, I am unsure it is good to stop investment races now unless they can also be stopped from happening later. Likewise, the consequences of U.S. leadership in such a race are likely to shape how lethal autonomous weapons proliferate in a more ethical direction, with lower probabilities of civilian deaths than the weapons that states would otherwise purchase.  It is also probably better to start figuring out what goes wrong while humans will still be controlling mostly autonomous drones than to wait for a bunch of countries to defect on unenforceable arms control agreements later in conflict and start deploying riskier/less well vetted systems.</p>
<p>If one thinks decision agencies will be better governed in the future, delaying technologies that centralize power may make sense to avoid locking in bad governments/companies/AI systems. However, to the degree competent bureaucracies can gain advantage from making risky tech investments regardless of their alignment with the general population, the more aligned systems must keep a lead to prevent others from locking in poor institutions.</p>
<p>Overall, arms races are wasteful and unsafe, but they may mitigate other even less safe races if they happen at the right time under the right conditions. In general, <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/War-What-Good-Conflict-Civilization/dp/0374286000"">by suppressing the incentive for violence between individuals and building up larger societies</a>, states pursuing power in zero-sum power races ultimately created positive sum economic spillovers from peace and innovation.</p>

<p>From Tokyo to TriBeCa, people are increasingly alone. People go on fewer dates, marry less and later, have smaller families if at all. People are having less sex, especially young people. The common complaint: <em>it’s just too hard</em>. Dating is hard, intimacy is hard, relationships are hard. <em>I’m not ready to play on hard mode yet, I’ll do the relationship thing when I level up.</em></p>
<p>And simultaneously, a cottage industry sprung up extolling the virtue of loneliness. Self-care, self-development, self-love. Travel solo, live solo, <em>you do you</em>. Wait, doesn’t that last one literally mean “go fuck yourself”?</p>
<p>This essay is to tell you: go fuck someone else. Ask someone on a date. At the very least, invite someone to hang out and ask them what they’re struggling with. This essay is not about <em>how</em> to make friends and lovers (a topic I’ll come back to), but an exhortation <em>to actually go and do that.</em> Now instead of later, directly instead of ass-backwards, seek relationships instead of seeking to be deemed worthy of relationships. If you think this is all too obvious to mention, reread the first two paragraphs again.</p>
<p>My argument doesn’t hinge on specific data relating to the intimacy recession and whether the survey counting sex dolls adjusted for inflation. If you’re reading Putanumonit as a brief escape from all the loving relationships smothering you, congrats! If you’re trying as hard as you can to connect and the world isn’t reciprocating, consider this essay as written for those you seek to connect with instead. <a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/03/24/should-you-reverse-any-advice-you-hear/"">Reverse all advice</a> as neccessary.</p>
<p>This essay’s epistemic status is whatever <a href=""https://thelastpsychiatrist.com/archives.html"">The Last Psychiatrist</a> was drinking.</p>
<p>Wherefore all this aloneness? The pink-hairs blame the red-pills who blame the pink-hairs. But really, they’re both in agreement that men and women are natural enemies and any interactions between the two are zero-sum. If you’re stuck in zero-sum thinking you’re probably on the wrong blog, but <a href=""https://putanumonit.com/2017/10/11/winning-is-for-losers/"">take this</a> as a first dose of medicine and then go give someone a hug.</p>
<p>One level up from the gender war is the class war. Leftists blame loneliness on capitalism — single people buy twice as many toasters, sex toys, and Netflix subscriptions. Rightists blame socialism — for the state to be your daddy it must first destroy the family. I won’t spend much time on this. If your ability to connect with people depends more than zero on the GDP composition that’s the problem right there. <em>“But in this economy…”</em> Listen, if you’re struggling to build financial capital, maybe now is the time to invest in relationship capital instead?</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/12/the-sex-recession/573949/"">The famous Atlantic article on</a> <em><a href=""https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/12/the-sex-recession/573949/"">The</a></em> <a href=""https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/12/the-sex-recession/573949/""></a> <em><a href=""https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/12/the-sex-recession/573949/"">Sex Recession</a></em> starts by noting that sex is now more accepted than ever:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If hookups are your thing, Grindr and Tinder offer the prospect of casual sex within the hour. The phrase <em>If something exists, there is porn of it</em> used to be a clever internet meme; now it’s a truism. BDSM plays at the local multiplex—but why bother going? Sex is portrayed, often graphically and sometimes gorgeously, on prime-time cable. Sexting is, statistically speaking, <a href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/sext-much-if-so-youre-not-alone/"">normal</a>.<br>
<em>Polyamory</em> is a household word. Shame-laden terms like <em>perversion</em> have given way to cheerful-sounding ones like <em>kink</em>. Anal sex has gone from final taboo to “fifth base”—<em>Teen Vogue</em> (yes, <em>Teen Vogue</em>) even <a href=""https://www.teenvogue.com/story/anal-sex-what-you-need-to-know"">ran a guide to it</a>. With the exception of perhaps incest and bestiality—and of course nonconsensual sex more generally—our culture has never been more tolerant of sex in just about every permutation.<br>
[…] These should be boom times for sex.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So why, in the words of philosopher Julia Kristeva, “everything is permitted and nothing is possible”?</p>
<p>I don’t think there’s a contradiction here. Everything is hard <em>because</em> it’s permitted.</p>
<p>There used to be no shortage of people who would judge you for having sex. Parents, peers, teachers, pastors, even the same media outlets that now claims to be “sex positive”. And when you had to escape surveillance and risk judgment just to make out with someone, it was HOT. <a href=""https://putanumonit.com/2019/04/30/the-state-of-affairs/"">The illicit is sexy</a>. Sneaking around created a bond based on a shared secret and merely having sex in the face of restriction was an achievement to be proud of. Having <em>good</em> sex was gravy.</p>
<p>If “the culture” no longer judges you for getting naked, who will? Your partner might. They’ll think you’re inexperienced, or too experienced, or too frigid or horny or vanilla or too weird. This can be a problem, but it’s ameliorated by your partner repeatedly telling you that <em>no, it was good, you’re just what they wanted</em>. You should believe them. If they didn’t like you they’d make like Hamlet and ghost.</p>
<p>The big problem is when you start judging yourself. You can hide from your parents. You can find a partner who doesn’t judge your shortcomings. But you can’t outrun your own insecurities.</p>
<p>It starts by comparing yourself to the internet. Everyone’s dick is bigger in porn, the tits are perkier. Everyone’s dates are more romantic on Instagram, their vacations sexier. People who suck at relationships are a lot less visible online.</p>
<p>It also turns out that society <em>will</em> judge you for looking for romance if your perceived status isn’t up to snuff. Try to date “out of your league” and you’ll be labeled a creep or a thot, depending on gender<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-7z3nAjmpre5JEjZL8-1"" id=""fnref-7z3nAjmpre5JEjZL8-1"">[1]</a></sup>. People who seek help with dating can run into this judgment and begin to internalize their perceived inadequacy. They start diverting all their energy into acquiring status markers, into being perceived as relationship-worthy by the real or imagined crowd of observers.</p>
<p>There’s no natural end to this process. As people spend more effort on status-climbing and self-improvement they spend less time in actual relationships. Unfortunately, you don’t get better at dating by learning to meditate or doing pushups alone in your room. When people who are obsessed with self-improvement have a miserable time on apps and first dates, they often conclude that problem is lack of self-improvement — surely when two well-developed high-status people effortless love will spark by itself! And so people keep chasing the next personal milestone. Get that degree, lose 10 pounds, learn that skill, read that book…</p>
<p>It’s important to distinguish between life’s necessities and extras. If you’ve just lost your job, are dealing with a health crisis, or moved to a new city where you have no friends then you should probably stabilize these issues before dating. Dating <em>is</em> hard, and acute crises should be solved directly and not by looking for salvation in a partner. But most self-development isn’t addressing real crises even if it pretends to.<br>
Self-development is riskless. Progress is slow but assured, and every step towards your personal goal is rewarded with likes and favs on social media. The pursuit itself raises one’s status. Opening up for connection, on the other hand, is scary. The rewards are great but so is the risk of failure. And real affection is the one thing you can’t brag about in an Instagram story. Intimacy for external consumption is not intimacy.</p>
<p>And so, as <a href=""https://twitter.com/visakanv/status/1095744739410759680"">the great guru</a> put it: <strong><em>people want to be fuckable more than they want to fuck</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Fuckability is capital. We seek to accumulate capital. Fucking is labor. We seek to avoid labor. And so people are more fuckable than ever, and do ever less fucking.</p>
<p>It gets worse.</p>
<p>The pathological case of becoming obsessed with status and perception is when relationships themselves are subjugated to this end. When the main measure of a relationship is in how it makes you appear. Narcissism.</p>
<p>I see it in rich women who refuse to date a man who makes less money than they do, no matter how severely it limits their mating pool, because it would be beneath them to have a poorer boyfriend. I see it men who refuse to date a woman who is a year older or an inch taller than they are.</p>
<p>It’s looking at <a href=""https://twitter.com/PennyRed/status/1099427595534376962"">accomplished women dropping out of demanding careers to raise kids</a> as sexism. Could it be that someone may prefer to raise a family to grinding 70 hours a week at the office once they don’t need to worry about money? I certainly would! But if the only thing you count is personal status<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-7z3nAjmpre5JEjZL8-2"" id=""fnref-7z3nAjmpre5JEjZL8-2"">[2]</a></sup> then it would seem to you that these women are being cheated out of something by the evil patriarchy.</p>
<p>Narcissists ask: <em>How does this relationship reinforce my</em> <em>ego narrative</em> <em>brand? How worthy does it make me seem?</em> Ego-poisoned people who are short of narcissism merely ask: <em>Would I be judged of a relationship?</em> These questions are self-focused, and intimacy requires that you relinquish them entirely. Instead, the question that starts all good relationships is: <em>Can I make someone happy?</em><sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-7z3nAjmpre5JEjZL8-3"" id=""fnref-7z3nAjmpre5JEjZL8-3"">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Making someone happy doesn’t imply <em>forever</em>, or <em>as happy as they can be,</em> or <em>happier than anyone else could make them</em>. A compliment makes a person happy. A text where you share something fun. Being a good listener on a date even if you didn’t blow their mind with electric conversation. A cuddle makes a person happy even if it stays a cuddle. Sex makes people happy even if it’s not PornHub-grade.</p>
<p>Romance is <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Py3uGnncqXuEfPtQp/interpersonal-entanglement"">the most complex and rewarding</a> multi-player game that humanity has invented. There are many romantic interactions that are short of your wildest dreams that are still worth having, that make two people happier than they would have been alone. And if you’re starting out, that’s where you should aim for.</p>
<p>Dating and sex and relationships are all trainable skills. You learn by doing. To learn painting you start by making 100 paintings. To get good at tennis you start by playing 100 matches. The first 100 will be mostly mediocre and some will be outright bad, but the 101st one has the chance to be good.</p>
<p>To go on a great date, you have to go on 100 mediocre dates. Or at least, put yourself in the mindset where that is your goal. That is how you learn to date and make people happy to be dating you. You learn how to deal with rejection and breakups and how to bounce back. Just as importantly, that’s where you learn to enjoy dating (<a href=""https://putanumonit.com/2019/12/30/100-ways-to-live-better/"">see rule 97</a>).</p>
<p>What if you’re not enjoying it? There are bad dates out there, people who are selfish and manipulative and dangerous or who just don’t show up. This sucks, and the only consolation is that with dating experience you get better at spotting them earlier.</p>
<p>But perhaps you are going on dates with lovely people but the dates aren’t going exactly according to the script you envisioned. Or the people who flirt and match with you are not quite what someone with your degrees and BMI and yoga skill deserves. In this case you <em>should</em> go back to self-development: fix your narcissism and figure out what value you actually provide to a romantic partner besides imagining that you raise their status through mere association.</p>
<p>How to tell if you’re in the latter category? If you get a lot of <em>“I can’t believe a great guy/gal like you can’t find a girlfriend/boyfriend”</em> from your friends, that’s a sign. Your friends saying that is not a compliment, it’s a mockery of your misguided self-focus. They’re saying that you have the resources to make someone happy, and that you’re failing to do so.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, dating is a matter of luck and circumstance. All you can do is be proactive and open. There’s no guarantee that you’ll meet the partners you want in a given time frame or for a given amount of mating effort. <a href=""https://putanumonit.com/2019/03/03/exponential-secretary/"">Exponential distributions are tough</a>: you go through one mediocre match after another, and there’s no way to predict when the positive outlier comes. But still, you’ll always do better the earlier you start.</p>
<p>Perhaps there was a hidden benefit to the premodern mating context when you had roughly one shot at a successful partnering — all you could do is invest in the one relationship you’re given. But now that the option to date without lifelong commitment exists it affects your dating life even if you don’t plan on it. The option is always there for you and your partners. Waiting until you hit some life marker to start dating just means that you miss out on years of learning what other people are looking for, and <a href=""https://putanumonit.com/2017/03/12/goddess-spreadsheet/"">what you yourself are</a> <a href=""https://putanumonit.com/2017/03/12/goddess-spreadsheet/""></a> <a href=""https://putanumonit.com/2017/03/12/goddess-spreadsheet/"">looking for</a> in a relationship.</p>
<p>And if you’re too busy for dating, actually busy with something that’s more important to you than romance, consider that dating doesn’t have to be a sink of time and energy. A casual date can be invigorating, and a partner can provide the support you need in your struggles.</p>
<p>So go out there and make some people mildly happy by going on mediocre dates<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-7z3nAjmpre5JEjZL8-4"" id=""fnref-7z3nAjmpre5JEjZL8-4"">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>and having mediocre sex and learning to connect with people romantically instead of having your head up your own ass. There are more interesting things to put in there with a partner.</p>

I&apos;m always happy to hear feedback; you can send it to me by replying to this email.</p><p>Audio version <u><a href=""http://alignment-newsletter.libsyn.com/alignment-newsletter-82"">here</a></u> (may not be up yet).</p><h2><strong>Highlights</strong></h2><p><u><a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.06680"">Dota 2 with Large Scale Deep Reinforcement Learning</a></u> <em>(OpenAI et al)</em> (summarized by Nicholas): In April, <u><a href=""https://openai.com/blog/how-to-train-your-openai-five/"">OpenAI Five</a></u> (<u><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/3e2f43012b07/an-54-boxing-a-finite-horizon-ai-system-to-keep-it-unambitious"">AN #54</a></u>) defeated the world champion Dota 2 team, OG. This paper describes its training process. OpenAI et al. hand-engineered the reward function as well as some features, actions, and parts of the policy. The rest of the policy was trained using PPO with an LSTM architecture at a massive scale. They trained this in a distributed fashion as follows:</p><p>- The <em>Controller</em> receives and distributes the updated parameters.</p><p>- The <em>Rollout Worker CPUs</em> simulate the game, send observations to the <em>Forward Pass GPUs</em> and publish samples to the <em>Experience Buffer</em>.</p><p>- The <em>Forward Pass GPUs</em> determine the actions to use and send them to the <em>Rollout Workers</em>.</p><p>- The <em>Optimizer GPUs</em> sample experience from the <em>Experience Buffer</em>, calculate gradient updates, and then publish updated parameters to the <em>Controller</em>.</p><p>The model trained over 296 days. In that time, OpenAI needed to adapt it to changes in the code and game mechanics. This was done via model &#x201C;surgery&#x201D;, in which they would try to initialize a new model to maintain the same input-output mapping as the old one. When this was not possible, they gradually increased the proportion of games played with the new version over time.</p><p><strong>Nicholas&apos;s opinion:</strong> I feel similarly to my opinion on <u><a href=""https://deepmind.com/blog/article/AlphaStar-Grandmaster-level-in-StarCraft-II-using-multi-agent-reinforcement-learning"">AlphaStar</a></u> (<u><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/ef55eb52b0fd/an-73-detecting-catastrophic-failures-by-learning-how-agents-tend-to-break"">AN #73</a></u>) here. The result is definitely impressive and a major step up in complexity from shorter, discrete games like chess or go. However, I don&#x2019;t see how the approach of just running PPO at a large scale brings us closer to AGI because we can&#x2019;t run massively parallel simulations of real world tasks. Even for tasks that can be simulated, this seems prohibitively expensive for most use cases (I couldn&#x2019;t find the exact costs, but I&#x2019;d estimate this model cost tens of millions of dollars). I&#x2019;d be quite excited to see an example of deep RL being used for a complex real world task without training in simulation.</p><h1><strong>Technical AI alignment</strong></h1><h3><strong>Technical agendas and prioritization</strong></h3><p><u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/LTFaD96D9kWuTibWr/just-imitate-humans"">Just Imitate Humans?</a></u> <em>(Michael Cohen)</em> (summarized by Rohin): This post asks whether it is safe to build AI systems that just imitate humans. The comments have a lot of interesting debate.</p><h3><strong>Agent foundations</strong></h3><p><u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/9sYzoRnmqmxZm4Whf/conceptual-problems-with-udt-and-policy-selection"">Conceptual Problems with UDT and Policy Selection</a></u> <em>(Abram Demski)</em> (summarized by Rohin): In Updateless Decision Theory (UDT), the agent decides &quot;at the beginning of time&quot; exactly how it will respond to every possible sequence of observations it could face, so as to maximize the expected value it gets with respect to its prior over how the world evolves. It is updateless because it decides ahead of time how it will respond to evidence, rather than updating once it sees the evidence. This works well when the agent can consider the full environment and react to it, and often gets the right result even when the environment can model the agent (as in Newcomblike problems), as long as the agent knows how the environment will model it.</p><p>However, it seems unlikely that UDT will generalize to logical uncertainty and multiagent settings. Logical uncertainty occurs when you haven&apos;t computed all the consequences of your actions and is reduced by thinking longer. However, this effectively is a form of updating, whereas UDT tries to know everything upfront and never update, and so it seems hard to make it compatible with logical uncertainty. With multiagent scenarios, the issue is that UDT wants to decide on its policy &quot;before&quot; any other policies, which may not always be possible, e.g. if another agent is also using UDT. The philosophy behind UDT is to figure out how you will respond to everything ahead of time; as a result, UDT aims to precommit to strategies assuming that other agents will respond to its commitments; so two UDT agents are effectively &quot;racing&quot; to make their commitments as fast as possible, reducing the time taken to consider those commitments as much as possible. This seems like a bad recipe if we want UDT agents to work well with each other.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> I am no expert in decision theory, but these objections seem quite strong and convincing to me.</p><p><u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/ySLYSsNeFL5CoAQzN/a-critique-of-functional-decision-theory"">A Critique of Functional Decision Theory</a></u> <em>(Will MacAskill)</em> (summarized by Rohin): <em>This summary is more editorialized than most.</em> This post critiques <u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05060"">Functional Decision Theory</a></u> (FDT). I&apos;m not going to go into detail, but I think the arguments basically fall into two camps. First, there are situations in which there is no uncertainty about the consequences of actions, and yet FDT chooses actions that do not have the highest utility, because of their impact on counterfactual worlds which &quot;could have happened&quot; (but ultimately, the agent is just leaving utility on the table). Second, FDT relies on the ability to tell when someone is &quot;running an algorithm that is similar to you&quot;, or is &quot;logically correlated with you&quot;. But there&apos;s no such crisp concept, and this leads to all sorts of problems with FDT as a decision theory.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> Like <u><a href=""https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/tDk57GhrdK54TWzPY/i-m-buck-shlegeris-i-do-research-and-outreach-at-miri-ama#iX6knDPMXZb696tDc"">Buck from MIRI</a></u>, I feel like I understand these objections and disagree with them. On the first argument, I agree with <u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/ySLYSsNeFL5CoAQzN/a-critique-of-functional-decision-theory#y8zRwcpNeu2ZhM3yE"">Abram</a></u> that a decision should be evaluated based on how well the agent performs with respect to the probability distribution used to define the problem; FDT only performs badly if you evaluate on a decision problem produced by conditioning on a highly improbable event. On the second class of arguments, I certainly agree that there isn&apos;t (yet) a crisp concept for &quot;logical similarity&quot;; however, I would be shocked if the <em>intuitive concept</em> of logical similarity was not relevant in the general way that FDT suggests. If your goal is to hardcode FDT into an AI agent, or your goal is to write down a decision theory that in principle (e.g. with infinite computation) defines the correct action, then it&apos;s certainly a problem that we have no crisp definition yet. However, FDT can still be useful for getting more clarity on how one ought to reason, without providing a full definition.</p><h3><strong>Learning human intent</strong></h3><p><u><a href=""https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2019/12/13/humans-cyclegan/"">Learning to Imitate Human Demonstrations via CycleGAN</a></u> <em>(Laura Smith et al)</em> (summarized by Zach): Most methods for imitation learning, where robots learn from a demonstration, assume that the actions of the demonstrator and robot are the same. This means that expensive techniques such as teleoperation have to be used to generate demonstrations. <strong>This paper presents a method to engage in automated visual instruction-following with demonstrations (AVID) that works by translating video demonstrations done by a human into demonstrations done by a robot.</strong> To do this, the authors use <u><a href=""https://junyanz.github.io/CycleGAN/"">CycleGAN</a></u>, a method to translate an image from one domain to another domain using unpaired images as training data. CycleGAN allows them to translate videos of humans performing the task into videos of the robot performing the task, which the robot can then imitate. In order to make learning tractable, the demonstrations had to be divided up into &apos;key stages&apos; so that the robot can learn a sequence of more manageable tasks. In this setup, the robot only needs supervision to ensure that it&apos;s copying each stage properly before moving on to the next one. To test the method, the authors have the robot retrieve a coffee cup and make coffee. AVID significantly outperforms other imitation learning methods and can achieve 70% / 80% success rate on the tasks, respectively.</p><p><strong>Zach&apos;s opinion:</strong> In general, I like the idea of &apos;translating&apos; demonstrations from one domain into another. It&apos;s worth noting that there do exist methods for translating visual demonstrations into latent policies. I&apos;m a bit surprised that we didn&apos;t see any comparisons with other adversarial methods like <u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.06158.pdf"">GAIfO</a></u>, but I understand that those methods have high sample complexity so perhaps the methods weren&apos;t useful in this context. It&apos;s also important to note that these other methods would still require demonstration translation. Another criticism is that AVID is not fully autonomous since it relies on human feedback to progress between stages. However, compared to kinetic teaching or teleoperation, sparse feedback from a human overseer is a minor inconvenience.</p><p><strong>Read more:</strong> <u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04443"">Paper: AVID: Learning Multi-Stage Tasks via Pixel-Level Translation of Human Videos</a></u></p><h3><strong>Preventing bad behavior</strong></h3><p><u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/megKzKKsoecdYqwb7/when-goodharting-is-optimal-linear-vs-diminishing-returns"">When Goodharting is optimal: linear vs diminishing returns, unlikely vs likely, and other factors</a></u> <em>(Stuart Armstrong)</em> (summarized by Flo): Suppose we were uncertain about which arm in a bandit provides reward (and we don&#x2019;t get to observe the rewards after choosing an arm). Then, maximizing expected value under this uncertainty is equivalent to picking the most likely reward function as a proxy reward and optimizing that; Goodhart&#x2019;s law doesn&#x2019;t apply and is thus not universal. This means that our fear of Goodhart effects is actually informed by more specific intuitions about the structure of our preferences. If there are actions that contribute to multiple possible rewards, optimizing the most likely reward does not need to maximize the expected reward. Even if we optimize for that, we have a problem if value is complex and the way we do reward learning implicitly penalizes complexity. Another problem arises if the correct reward is comparatively difficult to optimize: if we want to maximize the average, it can make sense to only care about rewards that are both likely and easy to optimize. Relatedly, we could fail to correctly account for diminishing marginal returns in some of the rewards.</p><p>Goodhart effects are a lot less problematic if we can deal with all of the mentioned factors. Independent of that, Goodhart effects are most problematic when there is little middle ground that all rewards can agree on.</p><p><strong>Flo&apos;s opinion:</strong> I enjoyed this article and the proposed factors match my intuitions. There seem to be two types of problems: extreme beliefs and concave Pareto boundaries. Dealing with the second is more important since a concave Pareto boundary favours extreme policies, even for moderate beliefs. Luckily, diminishing returns can be used to bend the Pareto boundary. However, I expect it to be hard to find the correct rate of diminishing returns, especially in novel situations.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> Note that this post considers the setting where we have uncertainty over the true reward function, but <em>we can&apos;t learn about the true reward function</em>. If you can gather information about the true reward function, which <u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/4783ufKpx8xvLMPc6/human-ai-interaction"">seems necessary to me</a></u> (<u><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/8c3f02cabccd/alignment-newsletter-41"">AN #41</a></u>), then it is almost always worse to take the most likely reward or expected reward as a proxy reward to optimize.</p><h3><strong>Robustness</strong></h3><p><u><a href=""https://openreview.net/pdf?id=S1gmrxHFvB"">AugMix: A Simple Data Processing Method to Improve Robustness and Uncertainty</a></u> <em>(Dan Hendrycks, Norman Mu et al)</em> (summarized by Dan H): This paper introduces a data augmentation technique to improve robustness and uncertainty estimates. The idea is to take various random augmentations such as random rotations, produce several augmented versions of an image with compositions of random augmentations, and then pool the augmented images into a single image by way of an elementwise convex combination. Said another way, the image is augmented with various traditional augmentations, and these augmented images are &#x201C;averaged&#x201D; together. This produces highly diverse augmentations that have similarity to the original image. Unlike techniques such as AutoAugment, this augmentation technique uses typical resources, not 15,000 GPU hours. It also greatly improves generalization to unforeseen corruptions, and it makes models more stable under small perturbations. Most importantly, even as the distribution shifts and accuracy decreases, this technique produces models that can <u><a href=""https://openreview.net/pdf?id=S1gmrxHFvB#page=8&amp;zoom=100,144,298"">remain calibrated under distributional shift</a></u>.</p><h3><strong>Miscellaneous (Alignment)</strong></h3><p><u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.00747"">Defining and Unpacking Transformative AI</a></u> <em>(Ross Gruetzemacher et al)</em> (summarized by Flo): The notion of <strong>transformative AI</strong> (TAI) is used to highlight that even narrow AI systems can have large impacts on society. This paper offers a clearer definition of TAI and distinguishes it from <strong>radical transformative AI</strong> (RTAI).</p><p>&quot;Discontinuities or other anomalous patterns in metrics of human progress, as well as <em>irreversibility</em> are common indicators of transformative change. TAI is then broadly defined as an AI technology, which leads to an irreversible change of some important aspects of society, making it a (multi-dimensional) spectrum along the axes of <strong>extremity</strong>, <strong>generality</strong> and <strong>fundamentality</strong>. &quot; For example, advanced AI weapon systems might have strong implications for great power conflicts but limited effects on people&apos;s daily lives; extreme change of limited generality, similar to nuclear weapons. There are two levels: while TAI is comparable to general-purpose technologies (GPTs) like the internal combustion engine, RTAI leads to changes that are comparable to the agricultural or industrial revolution. Both revolutions have been driven by GPTs like the domestication of plants and the steam engine. Similarly, we will likely see TAI before RTAI. The scenario where we don&apos;t is termed a <strong>radical shift</strong>.</p><p>Non-radical TAI could still contribute to existential risk in conjunction with other factors. Furthermore, if TAI precedes RTAI, our management of TAI can affect the risks RTAI will pose.</p><p><strong>Flo&apos;s opinion:</strong> Focusing on the impacts on society instead of specific features of AI systems makes sense and I do believe that the shape of RTAI as well as the risks it poses will depend on the way we handle TAI at various levels. More precise terminology can also help to prevent misunderstandings, for example between people forecasting AI and decision maker.</p><p><u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/dt4z82hpvvPFTDTfZ/six-ai-risk-strategy-ideas"">Six AI Risk/Strategy Ideas</a></u> <em>(Wei Dai)</em> (summarized by Rohin): This post briefly presents three ways that power can become centralized in a world with <u><a href=""https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/reframing/"">Comprehensive AI Services</a></u> (<u><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/b649f32b07da/alignment-newsletter-40"">AN #40</a></u>), argues that under risk aversion &quot;logical&quot; risks can be more concerning than physical risks because they are more correlated, proposes combining human imitations and oracles to remove the human in the loop and become competitive, and suggests doing research to generate evidence of difficulty of a particular strand of research.</p>",rohinmshah,rohinmshah,Rohin Shah,

</style></head><body><p>Inspired by my <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Kr76XzME7TFkN937z/cdt-going-bonkers-forever"">post</a> on problems with <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Kr76XzME7TFkN937z/cdt-going-bonkers-forever"">causal decision theory</a> (CDT), here is a hacked version of CDT that seems to be able to imitate <a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Timeless_decision_theory"">timeless decision theory</a> (TDT) and <a href=""https://intelligence.org/2017/10/22/fdt/"">functional decision theory</a><sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-af3qhLjEC3GQmCvyL-1"" id=""fnref-af3qhLjEC3GQmCvyL-1"">[1]</a></sup> (FDT), as well as <a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Updateless_decision_theory"">updateless decision theory</a> (UDT) under certain circumstances.</p>
<p>Call this ACDT, for (a)causal decision theory. It is, essentially, CDT which can draw extra, acausal arrows on the causal graphs, and which attempts to figure out which graph represents the world it's in. The drawback is its lack of elegance; the advantage, if it works, is that it's simple to specify and focuses attention on the important aspects of deducing the graph.</p>
<h1>Defining ACDT</h1>
<h2>CDT and the Newcomb problem</h2>
<p>In the <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6ddcsdA2c2XpNpE5x/newcomb-s-problem-and-regret-of-rationality"">Newcomb problem</a>, there is a predictor <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\Omega""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">Ω</span></span></span></span></span></span> who leaves two boxes, and predicts whether you will take one (""one-box"") or both (""two-box""). If <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\Omega""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">Ω</span></span></span></span></span></span> predicts you will one-box, it had put a large prize in that first box; otherwise that box is empty. There is always a small consolation prize in the second box.</p>
<p>In terms of causal graphs, we can represent it this way:</p>
<p><img src=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/fp0duyro51bcrqy/Newcomb_prob.png?raw=1"" alt=""""></p>
<p>The dark red node is the decision node, which the agent can affect. The green node is a utility node, whose value the agent cares about.</p>
<p>The CDT agent uses the ""<span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\mathtt{do}""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-texatom""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-type-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">d</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-type-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">o</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>"" operator from Pearl's <a href=""http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/BOOK-2K/index.html"">Causality</a>. Essentially all the incoming arrows to the decision node are cut (though the CDT agent keeps track of any information gained that way), then the CDT agent maximises its utility by choosing its action:</p>
<p><img src=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/wbetxl2fimal3hu/Newcomb_prob_CDT.png?raw=1"" alt=""""></p>
<p>In this situation, the CDT agent will always two-box, since it treats <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\Omega""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">Ω</span></span></span></span></span></span>'s decision as fixed, and in that case two-boxing dominates, since you get whatever's in the first box, plus the consolation prize.</p>
<h2>ACDT algorithm</h2>
<p>The ACDT algorithm is similar, except that when it cuts the causal links to its decision, it also adds potential links from that decision node to all the other nodes in the graph. Then it attempts to figure out which diagram is correct, and <em>then</em> maximises its utility in the CDT way.</p>
<p>Note that ACDT doesn't take a position on what these extra links are - whether they are pointing back in time or are reflecting some more complicated structure (such as the existence of predictors). It just assumes the links could be there, and then works from that.</p>
<p>In a sense, ACDT can be seen as anterior to CDT. How do we know that causality exists, and the rules it runs on? From our experience in the world. If we lived in a world where the Newcomb problem or the <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Kr76XzME7TFkN937z/predictors-exist-cdt-going-bonkers-forever"">predictors exist</a> problem were commonplace, then we'd have a different view of causality.</p>
<p>It might seem gratuitous and wrong to draw extra links coming out of your decision node - but it was also gratuitous and wrong to cut all the links that go into your decision node. Drawing these extra arrows undoes some of the damage, in a way that a CDT agent can understand (they don't understand things that cause their actions, but they do understand consequences of their actions).</p>
<h2>ACDT and the Newcomb problem</h2>
<p>As well as the standard CDT graph above, ACDT can also consider the following graph, with a link from its decision to <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\Omega""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">Ω</span></span></span></span></span></span>'s prediction:</p>
<p><img src=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/g3e5e9kmsotv7s2/Newcomb_prob_ACDT.png?raw=1"" alt=""""></p>
<p>It now has to figure out which graph represents the better structure for the situation it finds itself in. If it's encountered the Newcomb problem before, and tried to one-box and two-box a few times, then it knows that the second graph gives more accurate predictions. And so it will one-box, just as well as the TDT family does.</p>
<h2>Generalising from other agents</h2>
<p>If the ACDT agent has not encountered <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\Omega""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">Ω</span></span></span></span></span></span> themselves, but has seen it do the Newcomb problem for other agents, then the ""figure out the true graph"" becomes more subtle. UDT and TDT are built from the assumption that equivalent algorithms/agents in equivalent situations will produce equivalent results.</p>
<p>But ACDT, built out of CDT and its solipsistic cutting process, has no such assumptions - at least, not initially. It has to learn that the fate of other, similar agents, is evidence for its own graph. Once it learns that generalisation, then it can start to learn from the experience of others.</p>
<h1>ACDT on other decision problems</h1>
<h2>Predictors exist</h2>
<p>Each round of the <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Kr76XzME7TFkN937z/predictors-exist-cdt-going-bonkers-forever"">predictors exist</a> has a graph similar to the Newcomb problem, with the addition of a node to repeat the game:</p>
<p><img src=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/x37tgv1kftsek9c/pred_ex.png?raw=1"" alt=""""></p>
<p>After a few rounds, the ACDT agent will learn that the following graph best represents its situation:</p>
<p><img src=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/7kgbyjop3e8gtp9/pred_ex_ACDT.png?raw=1"" alt=""""></p>
<p>And it will then swiftly choose to leave the game.</p>
<h2>Prisoner's dilemma with identical copy of itself</h2>
<p>If confronted by the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma"">prisoner's dilemma</a> with an identical copy of itself, the ACDT agent, though unable to formalise ""we are identical"", will realise that they always make the same decision:</p>
<p><img src=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/fr7h1f14lcn4a8w/pris_dilemma.png?raw=1"" alt=""""></p>
<p>And it will then choose to cooperate.</p>
<h2>Parfit's hitchhiker</h2>
<p>The <a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Parfit's_hitchhiker"">Parfit's hitchhiker</a> problem is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Suppose you're out in the desert, running out of water, and soon to die - when someone in a motor vehicle drives up next to you. Furthermore, the driver of the motor vehicle is a perfectly selfish ideal game-theoretic agent, and even further, so are you; and what's more, the driver is Paul Ekman, who's really, really good at reading facial microexpressions. The driver says, ""Well, I'll convey you to town if it's in my interest to do so - so will you give me $100 from an ATM when we reach town?""</p>
<p>Now of course you wish you could answer ""Yes"", but as an ideal game theorist yourself, you realize that, once you actually reach town, you'll have no further motive to pay off the driver. ""Yes,"" you say. ""You're lying,"" says the driver, and drives off leaving you to die.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For ACDT, it will learn the following graph:</p>
<p><img src=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/pry0hh6j83umt76/p_hitchhiker.png?raw=1"" alt=""""></p>
<p>And will indeed pay the driver.</p>
<h2>XOR blackmail</h2>
<p>XOR blackmail is one of my favourite decision problems.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An agent has been alerted to a rumor that her house has a terrible termite infestation that would cost her $1,000,000 in damages. She doesn’t know whether this rumor is true.</p>
<p>A greedy predictor with a strong reputation for honesty learns whether or not it’s true, and drafts a letter: I know whether or not you have termites, and I have sent you this letter iff exactly one of the following is true: (i) the rumor is false, and you are going to pay me $1,000 upon receiving this letter; or (ii) the rumor is true, and you will not pay me upon receiving this letter.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The predictor then predicts what the agent would do upon receiving the letter, and sends the agent the letter iff exactly one of (i) or (ii) is true. Thus, the claim made by the letter is true. Assume the agent receives the letter. Should she pay up?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The CDT agent will have the following graph:</p>
<p><img src=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/dszi6dzeoux1uus/xor_CDT.png?raw=1"" alt=""""></p>
<p>And the CDT agent will make the simple and correct decision not to pay.</p>
<p>ACDT can eventually reach the same conclusion, but may require more evidence. It also has to consider graphs of the following sort:</p>
<p><img src=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/dsmuackfzstingi/xor_ACDT.png?raw=1"" alt=""""></p>
<p>The error of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidential_decision_theory"">evidential decision theory</a> (EDT) is, in effect, to act as if the light green arrow existed: that they can affect the existence of the termites through their decision.</p>
<p>ACDT, if confronted with similar problems often enough, will eventually learn that the light green arrow has no effect, while the dark green one does have an effect (more correctly: the model with the dark green arrow is more accurate, while the light green arrow doesn't add accuracy). It will then refuse to pay, just like the CDT agent does.</p>
<p>Note that we might define ACDT as only creating links with its own parent nodes - putting back the links it cut, but in the other direction. In that case it would only consider links with ""Your decision algorithm"" and ""Letter sent"", not with ""Termites in house?"", and would never pay. But note that ""Your decision algorithm"" is logical node, that might not exist in physical reality; that's why I designed ACDT to allow links to arbitrary nodes, not just the ones that are its ancestors, so it can capture more models about how the world works.</p>
<h2>Not UDT: counterfactual mugging</h2>
<p>The ACDT agent described above differs from UDT in that it doesn't pay the <a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Counterfactual_mugging"">counterfactual mugger</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\Omega""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">Ω</span></span></span></span></span></span> appears and says that it has just tossed a fair coin, and given that the coin came up tails, it decided to ask you to give it $100. Whatever you do in this situation, nothing else will happen differently in reality as a result. Naturally you don't want to give up your $100. But <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\Omega""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">Ω</span></span></span></span></span></span> also tells you that if the coin came up heads instead of tails, it'd give you $10,000, but only if you'd agree to give it $100 if the coin came up tails. Do you give <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\Omega""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">Ω</span></span></span></span></span></span> the $100?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Non-coincidentally, this problem is difficult to represent in a causal graph. One way of seeing it could be this way:</p>
<p><img src=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/tf3zio5j484fn9x/count_mug.png?raw=1"" alt=""""></p>
<p>Here the behaviour of the agent in the tails world, determines <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\Omega""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">Ω</span></span></span></span></span></span>'s behaviour in the heads world. It would be tempting to try and extend ACDT, by drawing an arrow from that decision node to the <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\Omega""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">Ω</span></span></span></span></span></span> node in the heads world.</p>
<p>But that doesn't work, because that decision only happens in the tails world - in the heads world, the agent has no decision to make, so ACDT will do nothing. And in the tails world, the heads world is only counterfactually relevant.</p>
<p>Now ACDT, like EDT, can learn, in some circumstances, to pay the counterfactual mugger. If this scenario happens a lot, then it can note that agents that pay in the tails world get rewarded in the heads world, thus getting something like this:</p>
<p><img src=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/jdpg6zqbp0o7ymx/count_mug_EDT.PNG?raw=1"" alt=""""></p>
<p>But that's a bit too much of a hack, even for a hack-y method like this. More natural and proper would be to have the ACDT agent not use its decision as the node to cut-and-add-links from, but its policy (or, as in <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xoQRz8tBvsznMXTkt/dissolving-confusion-around-functional-decision-theory"">this post</a>, its code). In that case, the counterfactual mugging can be represented as a graph by the ACDT agent:</p>
<p><img src=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/i3vjz8y7bfe83oc/count_mug_pol.PNG?raw=1"" alt=""""></p>
<h2>Fully acausal trade</h2>
<p>The ACDT agent might have issues with <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/MHHzLfAQBZzieGBjq/fully-acausal-trade"">fully acausal trade</a> (though, depending on your view, this might be <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6XCTppoPAMdKCPFb4/oracles-reject-all-deals-break-superrationality-with-1"">a feature not a bug</a>).</p>
<p>The reason being, that since the ACDT agent never gets to experience acausal trade, it never gets to check whether there is a link between it and hypothetical other agents - imagine a Newcomb problem where you never get to see the money (which may be going to a charity you support - but that charity may not exist either), nor whether <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\Omega""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">Ω</span></span></span></span></span></span> exists.</p>
<p>If an ACDT ever discovered acausal trade, it would have to do so in an incremental fashion. It would first have to become comfortable enough with prediction problems so that drawing links to predictors is a natural thing for it to do. It would have to become comfortable enough with hypothetical arguments being correct, that it could generalise to situations where it cannot ever get any empirical evidence.</p>
<p>So whether an ACDT agent ever engages in fully acausal trade, depends on how it generalises from examples.</p>
<h2>Neural nets learning to be ACDT</h2>
<p>It would be interesting to program a neural net ACDT agent, based on these example. If anyone is interested in doing so, let me know and go ahead.</p>
<h1>Learning graphs and priors over graphs</h1>
<p>The ACDT agent is somewhat slow and clunky at learning, needing quite a few examples before it can accept unconventional setups.</p>
<p>If we want it to go faster, we can choose to modify its priors. For example, we can look at what evidence would convince us that an accurate predictor existed, and put a prior that would have a certain graph, conditional on seeing that evidence.</p>
<p>Or if we want to be closer to UDT, we could formalise statements about algorithms, and about their features and similarities (or formalise mathematical results about proofs, and about how to generalise from known mathematical results). Adding that to the ACDT agent gives an agent much closer to UDT.</p>
<p>So it seems that ACDT+""the correct priors"", is close to various different acausal agent designs.</p>

A complex criticism to the “keep it simple” universal coding advice</em></h2><p>It is easy to find articles and decalogues where experienced software developers manifest what they think are good rules for coding. Usually those recommendations are expressed with strong belief due to the reinforcement from similar opinions of most other authors, and due to they apparently emerge from plausible goals like readability, maintainability or simplicity. Who could question those goals? Probably no one since they are desirable goals but…are they objectively measurable?<br><br>After years of trying to think like a machine, what surely has affected my perception of complexity, I can write this response to some of those recommendations, not because of an opposed belief but because a reflection about how those recommendations supposedly drive to the goals is necessary.</p><hr class=""dividerBlock""><h1>I would like to begin with an anecdote</h1><p>Some years ago I was working in an R&amp;D project trying to solve a really intricate problem. I had been blocked for more than five months when I finally saw the light. One week later I had the corresponding algorithm implemented and it worked. I felt like a victorious warrior after the hardest battle.<br><br>Having passed near two years I noticed that a determined casuistic was not correctly treated by the algorithm so I had to review it, nothing special. I read the algorithm’s documentation, I read the source code and, to my surprise, I was unable to understand it!. How was it possible!, I figured out the solution!, I implemented the algorithm!, I commented the source code!, I wrote the extended documentation!, then why wasn’t I able to understand what my own program was doing?</p><p>I read all again several times and it took me two hours of thinking about the problem until I achieved the understanding of the algorithm I implemented to solve it. The experience was so disgusting that I promised myself this will never happen again. I had to be more careful and exhaustive when documenting a process as complex as that and when commenting its implementation. Then I prepared to rewrite the extended documentation and…amazingly, I realized that the documentation I initially wrote correctly explained the problem and its solution, and that the comments in the source code were useful and sufficient.<br><br>What had actually happened was very simple. After so much time working on other different problems I had almost completely forgotten the details of this one and how I walked around it. The problem was too devious and the solution too complex to expect an immediate comprehension. But despite the initial documentation was adequate I concluded it was necessary to add the following warning for the next time that code need to be maintained: “<em>WARNING: You will have to reflect about the problem and the proposed solution more than an hour before working on it in order to rebuild the mental schemes necessary to understand it.</em>”</p><hr class=""dividerBlock""><h1>“Alice in wonderland” versus “The theory of general relativity”</h1><p>Between the “Hello world” application and the most sophisticated scientific or AI tools, there are many types of software projects each one offering various degrees of complexity. All of them share a pretty obvious characteristic: they are all pieces of software written in one of the different available programming languages. This common feature usually leads to the belief that any piece of software can be maintained by any IT professional with enough experience in the corresponding programming language. While this is true for some maintenance tasks, the whole maintenance job in its full extension requires something else.<br><br>In order to successfully perform the complete and continuous maintenance work for a piece of software by a person distinct to the author, the professional should not only be an expert in the technology used to develop the software, this person also needs a deep understanding of the underlying problem that the software solves what, in return, reveals the very sense of the code to be maintained. When this problem is complex and new to the person, the immersion in the source code will demand effort, patience and, probably, additional experience in a specific knowledge field.</p><p>You can read “Alice in wonderland” at a rate of one page per minute, but you cannot do that when trying to understand “The theory of general relativity”. And you cannot ask Einstein for keeping it simple, just because it is not simple. It may take several months to feel comfortable with the existent source code when you join a new project, even when it is exhaustively documented. And if you are expecting to find “Alice in wonderland” but you face “The theory of general relativity” you will blame the original programmer because the code is unreadable, is obfuscated and is too hard to maintain arguing he didn’t follow those universal programming rules that everybody knows to generate “good code”.</p><hr class=""dividerBlock""><h1>The spaghetti mind</h1><p> In  the other hand, it is also true that there are disastrous programmers  that write code unnecessarily devious, poorly documented and, when  criticized, may argue they are misunderstood precisely because they are  like Einstein. If you are programming the “Hello world” application and  nobody is able to understand it, then you should review your coding  methodology. But I’m not speaking about this case, I’m speaking about  the case where the deviousness of the code arises from the real and  unavoidable complexity of the underlying problem. Is there then a  universal methodology to “keep it simple”?</p><p><a href=""https://www.techopedia.com/definition/9476/spaghetti-code"">Spaghetti code</a>,  this dreadful programming concept where too many things are chaotically  interconnected, could be more natural than we usually think. Curiously  the software is one of the best artificial representations of the  processes carried out within our mind. Indeed our brain storage system  is spaghetti memory (the technical term is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergraph"">hypergraph</a>).  Unfortunately most of these mental processes are intrinsically more  complex than we would like, and little can be done to simplify them.</p><p>There is nothing wrong with implementing six or more nested loops when working with multidimensional objects if that is the natural way to do it. It is OK to modify the arguments of a function if you know what you are doing and why it is convenient. There is nothing bad in writing a function or a class method with 500 lines of code if the process demands it. And splitting that code in smaller functions may be of little help. Do not encapsulate a code fragment within a function if you don’t foresee to use that function in several parts or in a recursive algorithm. Forcing the creation of a function is creating a new object that complicates the code. It breaks the natural flow of the code and hinders the possibility of reusing variables already instantiated. And take into account that a function call is a process itself that consumes computing resources so avoid calling functions within a loop if you can.<br><br>If you want to increase readability, it’s better to separate the code fragments corresponding to specific subprocesses with blank lines and give them a title with an uppercase comment.</p><hr class=""dividerBlock""><h1>Conclusion</h1><h2><em>“Sometimes we have to find the beauty in the complexity of an efficient solution to a devious problem”</em></h2><p>Sometimes an algorithm is extremely complex because the underlying problem to solve is extremely complex, and nothing can be done to make the code easily understandable. Some methodologies and recommendations demand a limit for the size of functions, methods or classes, but you should question how this can really make the code simpler. Make your code compact, optimize it removing unnecessary instructions and document it in detail.<br><br>The reaction before complexity depends much on psychology. We are naturally conditioned to perceive harmony in simplicity. But sometimes we have to find the beauty in the complexity of an efficient solution to a devious problem and in the exhaustive management of its wide casuistic.<br><br>To deal with devilish deviousness is a dirty work but, from time to time, someone has to do it. Keep it simple? Yes of course…when you can.</p>",juan-andres-hurtado-baeza,juan-andres-hurtado-baeza,Juan Andrés Hurtado Baeza,

"">Red Flags for Rationalization</a> </p><hr class=""dividerBlock""><p>It is often said that the best way to resist temptation is to avoid it.  This includes the temptation to rationalize.  You can avoid rationalization by denying it the circumstances in which it would take place.</p><p>When you avoid rationalization, you don&apos;t need to worry about infinite regress of metacognition, nor about overcompensation.  As a handy bonus, you can demonstrate to others that you weren&apos;t rationalizing, which otherwise involves a lot of introspection and trust.</p><p>Here are three ways to do it:</p><h1>Double Blinding</h1><p>Identify the thing that would control your rationalization and arrange not to know it.</p><p>The trope namer is experimental science.  You might be tempted to give better care to the experimental than the control group, but not if you don&apos;t know which is which.  In many cases, you can maintain the blinding in statistical analysis as well, comparing &quot;group A&quot; to &quot;group B&quot; and only learning which is which after doing the math.</p><p>Similarly, if you are evaluating people (e.g. for a job) and are worried about subconscious sexism (or overcompensation for it), write a script or ask a friend to strip all gender indicators from the application.</p><p>Unfortunately, this technique requires you to <em>anticipate</em> the rationalization risk.  Once you notice you might be rationalizing, it&apos;s usually too late to double-blind.</p><h1>End-to-End Testing</h1><p>A logical argument is a series of mental steps that build on each other.  If the argument is direct, every step must be correct.  As such, it is somewhat similar to a computer program.  You wouldn&apos;t write a nontrivial computer program, look it over, say &quot;that looks right&quot; and push it to production.  You would test it.  With as close as possible to a full, end-to-end test before trusting it.</p><p>What does testing look like for an argument?  Take a claim near the end of the argument which can be observed.  Go and observe it.  Since you have a concrete prediction, it should be a lot easier to make the observation.</p><p>Once you&apos;ve got that, you don&apos;t need the long chain of argument that got you there.  So it doesn&apos;t matter if you were rationalizing along the way.  The bit at the end of the argument which you haven&apos;t chopped off still needs scrutinizing, but it&apos;s shorter, so you can give each bit more attention.</p><p>Suppose you&apos;re organizing some sort of event, and you want to not bother planning cleanup because you&apos;ll just tell all the crowd at the end &quot;ok, everybody clean up now&quot;.  You expect this to work out because of the known agentiness and competence of the crowd, overlap with HOPE attendees, estimates of the difficulty of cleanup tasks....  There&apos;s a lot of thinking that could have gone wrong, and a lot of communal pride pressuring you to rationalize.  Instead of examining each question, try asking these people to clean up in some low-stakes situation.</p><p>(Do be careful to actually observe.  I&apos;ve seen people use their arguments to make predictions, then update on those predictions as if they were observations.)</p><p>This approach is also highly effective against non-rationalization errors in analysis as well.  It&apos;s also especially good at spotting problems involving unknown unknowns.</p><h1>The Side of Safety</h1><p>Sometimes, you don&apos;t need to know.</p><p>Suppose you&apos;re about to drive a car, and are estimating whether you gain nontrivial benefit from a seatbelt.  You conclude you will not, but note this could be ego-driven rationalization causing you to overestimate your driving talent.  You <em>could</em> try to re-evaluate more carefully, or you could observe that the <em>costs</em> of wearing a seatbelt are trivial.</p><p>When you&apos;re uncertain about the quality of your reasoning, it makes sense to have a probability density function of posteriors for a yes-no question.  But when the payoff table is lopsideded enough, you might find the vast bulk of the PDF is on one side of the decision threshold.  And then you can just decide.</p><hr class=""dividerBlock""><p>Next: <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ykZbEpRTuywWmaAwz/testing-for-rationalization"">Testing for Rationalization</a> </p>",dspeyer,dspeyer,dspeyer,

With these algorithms it is possible to analyze large amounts of data that are impossible to analyze with other techniques, helping to detect characteristics that might otherwise be impossible to recognize. This automatic feature detection allows you to classify cellular images, make genomic connections, advance drug discovery, and even find links between different types of data, from genomics and images to electronic medical records.[1]</p><p>However, as S. Webb pointed in a technology feature published in Nature, like any computational-biology technique, the results that arise from artificial intelligence are only as good as the data that go in. Overfitting a model to its training data is also a concern. In addition, for deep learning, the criteria for data quantity and quality are often more rigorous than some experimental biologists might expect [2]. Regarding this aspect,  if organisms behave more like observers who make decisions depending a constant changing environment, then this strategy is not useful at all because individual decisions introduce constant irregularities in the collected data that cannot be grasped in a simple model or principle[3].</p><p>This perspective is not only a challenge to research in biology but seeks for an alternative approach to our understanding of intelligence, since the goal is not only to understand and simply classify individual complex structures and organisms, but is also about how these individual intelligences (heterogeneously) distribute into spaces and (eco) systems, and generate coherence[4] from apparent incoherent world. This perspective also has implications about how any research and derived technologies about intelligence cannot be seen as an isolated phenomenon from the rest of the nature.  </p><h2>Big data as golden pathway in biology?</h2><p>We currently live in a golden age of the biology in part due to the idea that biological systems consist of a relationship between the parts (e.g. molecules) and the whole (e.g. organisms or ecosystems). Thanks to advances in technology (for instance in microscopy), mathematics and informatics it is possible today to measure and model complex systems by interconnecting different components at different scales in the space and depending on time[5]. To this end, large amounts of data are gathered to identify patterns [6]that allow the identification of dynamic models.</p><p>This -apparently successful- working method is defined as the paradigm of &quot;microarray&quot;[7]. This name originates from the microarray technique in biology to visualize relevant intracellular biochemical reactions by labeling proteins with phosphorescent markers. An eye-catching and important example of such a trend can be seen in biosciences, where drug effectivity or disease detection are, in practice, addressed through the study of groups, similarities and other structured characteristics of huge sets of chemical compounds (microarrays) derived from genetic, protein or even tissue samples. Traditional study of biological systems requires reductive methods in which amounts of data are collected by category. To do this, computers are useful to analyze and model this data[8], in part by using machine learning tools such as deep learning[9], to create accurate, real-time models of the response of a system to environmental and internal stimuli, for example in the development of therapies for cancer treatment[10].</p><p>However, a significant challenge for the advancement of this systemic approach is that the data needed for modeling are incomplete, contain biases and imbalances, and are continually evolving. Generally, usually the fault lies with the modeler and its methods and technologies used to design and build the model, which has no choice but to increase the amount and diversity of the data, perform various model optimizations and model training, and even make use of sloppy parameterization in its models[11]. </p><p>Assuming that organisms are like robots that automatically operate through a set of well-defined internal mechanisms, then bias in the data can only be originated from factors outside the organism. </p><p>But even when data problems stem from the measurement methodology, we should not forget that biological systems and organisms are also observers who have complex organized interior states that allow observation of the environment. As organisms respond to their inner states, they are also obliged to move within their environment[12]. This implies a constant adaptation that continuously disregards the use of historical data to train models. Thus, flexible responses of the organisms to the environment, imply that bias can also originate from the organism itself, and that organisms can also adapt or restrict their adaption to experimental conditions. Therefore, in biology is also applies that the experimenter can also influence the experimental outputs. </p><p>This implies that living entities do not react blind to their environment, but also subjectively decide what that response should be. For instance, Denis Noble argue that &#x201C;<em>life is a symphony that connect organisms and environment across several scales and is much more than a blind mechanism&#x201D; </em>[13]. This constant sensing across several scales implies that mechanisms and pathways[14] are also adapting and changing as a constant flow[15], and that they are implicitly incomplete, challenging the explicit or implicit accounting of causal explanations based on mechanisms and pathways.</p><p>Therefore, cognition is not the characteristic of single organisms, but implies the participation of all the organisms subject to any analysis. This type of natural distributed cognition poses a challenge to the way we understand the world and process that information, either to build mechanistic models or to use entropy reduction methods in machine learning to build black box models. Recognizing that &quot;biological systems&quot; are a set of observers who make decisions we are continually considering systems with &quot;ears and eyes&quot; that are also able to model their environment and actions, including the experimental conditions to which they are subject. Because organisms, such as cells, are continually interacting and deciding on their environment[16], they can also develop intrinsic biases, for example in  the responsiveness of growth factors[17] [18].</p><p>Consequently, instead to accumulate ever more data to try to have a better approach of a biological system it is preferable to better acknowledge how an organism senses and &#x201C;computes&#x201D;[19] its environment[20]. To this end we argue that the use of concepts coming from cognitive computation will be relevant to better analyze small amounts of data. As has been referred in an overview about this topic, <em>cognitively-inspired mechanisms should be investigated in order to make the algorithms more intelligent, powerful, and effective in extracting insightful knowledge, from huge amounts of heterogeneous Big data </em>[21]<em>, </em>with topics that span cognitive inspired neural networks to semantic knowledge understanding. Our focus in this work orients in part to such approaches, while recognize the possibility of a natural distributed cognition in biological systems. </p><p>Finally, we want to point out that acknowledging this kind of distributed cognition in biological systems is not only relevant from a philosophical, but also from a practical point of view, since it points to minimize the amount of data required to train models. For instance, Ghanem et al. employed two metaheuristics, the artificial bee colony algorithm and the dragonfly algorithm to define a metaheuristic optimizer to train a multilayer perceptron to reach a set of weights and biases that can yield high performance compared to traditional learning algorithms[22]. Therefore, a clever combination of natural bias with a recognition of heterogeneities in the data used to train models in biology contribute to the development of efficient modelling methodologies using few datasets. </p><h2>Perspectives</h2><p>Currently, deep learning algorithms used for biology research have required extremely large and well-annotated datasets to learn how to distinguish features and categorize patterns. Larger, clearly labeled datasets, with millions of data points representing different experimental and physiological conditions, give researchers the most flexibility to train an algorithm. But for optimal training, algorithms require many well-annotated examples, which can be exceptionally difficult to obtain[23].</p><p>This implies that a safe use of this technology for modelling of biological systems requires <em>of looking at the model through the lens of the training data </em>[24]<em>. </em>Our central point is that the safe use of methods for modelling in biology and medicine must recognize that organisms are also active and intelligent observers[25], and that modelling technologies can be used in a &#x201C;safe&#x201D; way only when organisms or agents behave more or less in a &#x201C;mechanistic&#x201D; way. </p><p>On the other hand, we argue that the use of small data amounts, for instance based on a clever use of cognitive bias[26], can be a promising way to better understand and eventually model biological systems in a fairer (and safer) way. </p><p>These arguments also imply that (from a biological perspective) no form of intelligence should be investigated as an isolated phenomenon, and that any form of intelligence (in any organism, including humans) should be referred to the environment and interaction with other organisms, since nature is a loop where each organism is modeling other organisms as well as the common environment.</p><p>For example, constant reciprocal modeling between organisms and the environment is part of the central theme of the film Jurassic Park: according to this story, thanks to biotechnological advances it was possible to reproduce and control a population of dinosaurs produced de novo from DNA fragments blood found the stomachs of fossilized insects preserved in amber; the film portrays how from a human perspective this population of dinosaurs was under control, but no one in the park was aware  that these dinosaurs were at the same time  adapting and changing their behavior, and they were also modeling humans, so at the end the theme park ends in a catastrophe where humans lose its control. </p><p>This was a sci-fi film that perhaps was far from reality but helps illustrate several examples in biology where living beings are much more than a piece of hardware and biotech software.</p><p>In the nature there are several examples that illustrates this fact, i.e.  how life is much more than a set of modellable biotechnical systems, like for instance the observed ability of octopuses to develop empathy and friendships with humans[27], or horses that model human behavior and even demonstrate high cognitive abilities (e.g. intelligent Hans effect[28]). </p><p>Thus, to see the world, and model it, we must go beyond the data, since each part in the nature is continuously relearning. Following Maurice Merleau-Ponty[29], to see the world (and in this case biological systems) we must break with familiar acceptance of it.</p><p>    </p><p>[1]<a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02174-z""> https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02174-z</a></p><br><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02174-z"">https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02174-z</a> </p><br><p>[3] <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303264716300016"">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303264716300016</a> </p><br><p>[4] Coherence has in this context a physical meaning</p><br><p>[5] <a href=""https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(05)00400-9"">https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(05)00400-9</a> </p><br><p>[6] Such as space-based forms of organization or fluctuations in time </p><br><p>[7] <a href=""https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10699-010-9186-7"">https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10699-010-9186-7</a> </p><br><p>[8] <a href=""https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030116"">https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030116</a> </p><br><p>[9] <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02174-z"">https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02174-z</a> </p><br><p>[10] <a href=""https://nyaspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/nyas.13215"">https://nyaspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/nyas.13215</a> </p><br><p>[11] This notion also applies to other models,  such as climate and economics (Freedman, 2011) </p><br><p>[12] <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/life/"">https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/life/</a> </p><br><p>[13] <a href=""https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-music-of-life-9780199295739?cc=de&amp;lang=en&amp;"">https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-music-of-life-9780199295739?cc=de&amp;lang=en&amp;</a> </p><br><p>[14] In what follows we distinguish mechanisms, as biological phenomenon that can be understood from fundamental and invariant physicochemical principles, from pathways, which are a sequence of causal steps that string together an upstream cause to a set of causal intermediates to some downstream outcome.</p><br><p>[15] <a href=""https://academic.oup.com/bjps/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/bjps/axy078/5239997?redirectedFrom=fulltext"">https://academic.oup.com/bjps/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/bjps/axy078/5239997?redirectedFrom=fulltext</a> </p><br><p>[16] <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4948788/"">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4948788/</a> </p><br><p>[17] <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC23470/"">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC23470/</a> </p><br><p>[18] Intrinsic biases in biology are similar but not equal to the concept of internal bias of agents in psychology and economy, which is a concept applicable only to the human cognition. </p><br><p>[19] &#x201C;Computing&#x201D; means in this context sensing more than defining algorithms to perform a given operation </p><br><p>[20] <a href=""https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/ARTL_a_00254"">https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/ARTL_a_00254</a> </p><br><p>[21] <a href=""https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12559-017-9532-y"">https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12559-017-9532-y</a> </p><br><p>[22] <a href=""https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12559-018-9588-3"">https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12559-018-9588-3</a> </p><br><p>[23] <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02174-z"">https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02174-z</a> </p><br><p>[24] <a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.04730v2.pdf"">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.04730v2.pdf</a> </p><br><p>[25] <a href=""https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00239-017-9823-7"">https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00239-017-9823-7</a> </p><br><p>[26] <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25679-z"">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25679-z</a> </p><br><p>[27] <a href=""http://seachangeproject.com/projects/"">http://seachangeproject.com/projects/</a> </p><br><p>[28]<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clever_Hans""> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clever_Hans</a></p><br><p>[29] <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/merleau-ponty/#PhenPerc"">https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/merleau-ponty/#PhenPerc</a> </p>",HansNauj,hansnauj,HansNauj,

<p>In Paul's classic post <a href=""https://ordinaryideas.wordpress.com/2016/11/30/what-does-the-universal-prior-actually-look-like/"">What does the universal prior actually look like?</a> he lays out an argument that the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomonoff%27s_theory_of_inductive_inference"">universal prior</a>, if it were to be used for important decisions, would likely be malign, giving predictions that would effectively be under the control of alien consequentialists. He argues for this based on an 'anthropic update' the aliens could make that would be difficult to represent in a short program. We can split this update into two parts: an 'importance update' restricting attention to bits fed into priors used to make important decisions, and what I'm calling a 'lexical update' which depends on the particular variant of the universal prior being used. I still believe that the 'importance update' would be very powerful, but I'm not sure anymore about the 'lexical update'. So in this post I'm going to summarize both in my own words then explain my skepticism towards the 'lexical update'.</p>
<p>As background, note that 'straightforwardly' specifying data such as our experiences in the universal prior will take far more bits than just describing the laws of physics, as you'll also need to describe our location in spacetime, an input method, and a set of Everett branches(!), all of which together will probably take more than 10000 bits(compared to the laws alone which likely only take a few hundred) Thus, any really short program(a few hundred bits, say) that could somehow predict our experiences well would likely have a greater probability according to the universal prior than the 'straightforward' explanation.</p>
<p>Paul's post argues that there likely do exist such programs. I'm going to fix a reference prefix machine U which generates a universal prior. The argument goes:</p>
<p>A) there are many long-running programs with short descriptions according to U, such as our universe.</p>
<p>B) If other programs are like our universe's program, aliens could evolve there and end up taking over their programs.</p>
<p>C) Since their program has high measure in U, the aliens will plausibly have been selected to be motivated to control short programs in U.</p>
<p>D) To control U, the aliens could try to manipulate beings using the universal prior who have control over short programs in U (like us, hypothetically)</p>
<p>E) If the aliens are reasonably motivated to manipulate U, we can sample them doing that with few bits.</p>
<p>F) The aliens will now try to output samples from Q, the distribution over people using the universal prior to make important decisions(decisions impacting short programs in U). They can do this much more efficiently than any 'straightforward' method. For instance, when specifying which planet we are on, the aliens can restrict attention to planets which eventually develop life, saving a great many bits.</p>
<p>G) The aliens can then choose a low-bit broadcast channel in their own universe, so the entire manipulative behavior has a very short description in U.</p>
<p>H) For a short program to compete with the aliens, it would essentially need access to Q. But this seems really hard to specify briefly.</p>
<p>So far I agree. But the post also argues that <strong>even a short program that could sample from Q</strong> would still lose badly to the aliens, based on what I'm calling a 'lexical update', as follows:</p>
<p>I) In practice most people in U using 'the universal prior' won't use U itself but one of many variants U'(different universal programming languages)</p>
<p>J) Each of those variants U' will have their own Q', the distribution over people making important decisions with U'. Q is then defined as the average over all of those variants(with different U' weighted by simplicity in U)</p>
<p>K) Since short programs in different U' look different from each other, the aliens in those programs will be able to tell which variant U' they are likely to be in.</p>
<p>L) The distributions Q' of people in U using different variants U' all look different. Describing each Q' given Q should take about as many bits as it takes to specify U' using U.</p>
<p>M) But the aliens will already know they are in U', and so can skip that, gaining a large advantage even over Q.</p>
<p>But there's a problem here. In C) it was argued that aliens in short programs in U will be motivated to take over other short programs in U. When we condition on the aliens actually living somewhere short according to U', they are instead motivated to control short programs in U'. This would reduce their motivation to control short programs in U proportionally to the difficulty of describing U in U', and with less motivation, it takes more bits to sample their manipulative behaviors in E).  The advantage they gained in L) over Q was proportional to the difficulty of describing U' in U. On average these effects should cancel out, and the aliens' probability mass will be comparable to Q.</p>
<p>The universal prior is still likely malign, as it's probably hard to briefly specify Q, but it no longer seems to me like the aliens would decisively beat Q. I still feel pretty confused about all this so comments pointing out any mistakes or misinterpretations would be appreciated.</p>

And if you want to prepare the future, what should come to your mind?</p><p>It seems that when most people hear AI, they think of <em>robots</em>. Weirdly, this observation includes both laymen and some top academics. <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Human-Compatible-Artificial-Intelligence-Problem/dp/0525558616"">Stuart Russell&apos;s book</a> (which I greatly enjoyed) is such an example. It often presents robots as an example of an AI.</p><p>But this seems problematic to me. I believe that <em>we should dissociate a lot more AIs from robots</em>. In fact, given that most people will nevertheless think of robots when we discuss AIs, we might even want to use the terminology <em>algorithms</em> rather <em>AIs</em>. And perhaps <em>algorithms with superhuman-level world model and planning capabilities</em> instead of <em>AGIs</em>...</p><p>To defend this claim, I shall argue that the most critical aspects of today&apos;s and tomorrow&apos;s world-scale ethical problems (including x-risks) have and will have to do with algorithms; not robots. Moreover, and most importantly, the example of robots raises both concerns and solutions that seem in fact irrelevant to algorithms. Finally, I&apos;ll conclude by arguing that the example of today&apos;s large-scale algorithms is actually useful, because it motivates <em>AI alignment</em>.</p><h1>It&apos;s about algorithms, not robots!</h1><h2>AIs that matter are algorithms</h2><p>Today&apos;s AI research is mostly driven by non-robotic applications, from natural language processing to image analysis, from protein folding to query answering, from autocompletion to video recommendation. This is where the money is. Google is investing (hundreds of?) millions of dollars in improving its search engine and YouTube&apos;s recommendation system. Not in building robots.</p><p>Today&apos;s ranking, content moderation and automated labeling algorithms are arguably a lot more influential than robots. YouTube&apos;s algorithms have arguably become the biggest opinion-maker worldwide. <a href=""https://science4all.org/wiki/index.php?title=YouTube"">They present risks and opportunities on a massive scale.</a></p><p>And it seems that there is an important probability that tomorrow&apos;s most influential algorithms will be somewhat similar, even if they achieve <em>artificial general intelligence</em>. Such algorithms will likely be dematerialized, on the cloud, with numerous copies of themselves stored in several data centres and terminals throughout the world. </p><p>And they will be extremely powerful. Not because they have some strong physical power. But because they control the flow of information.</p><h2>The power of information</h2><p>At the heart of the distinction between algorithms and robots is the distinction between <em>information</em> and <em>matter</em>. Physics has long turned our attention towards matter and energy. Biology studied on animals, plants and key molecules. Historians  focused on monuments, artefacts and industrial revolution. But as these fields grew, they all seem to have been paying more and more attention to information. Physics studied <em>entropy</em>. Biology analyzed <em>gene expressions</em>. History celebrated the invention of language, writing, printing, and now computing.</p><p>Arguably, this is becoming the case for all of our society. Information has become critical to every government, every industry and every charity. Essentially all of today&apos;s jobs are actually <em>information processing</em> jobs. They are about collecting information, storing information, processing information and emitting information. This very blog post was written after a collection of information, which were then processed and now emitted.</p><p>By collecting and analyzing information, you can have a much better idea of what is wrong and what to do. And crucially, by emitting the right information to the right entities, you can start a movement, manipulate individuals and start a revolution. Information is what changes the world.</p><h2>Better algorithms are information game changers</h2><p>We humans used to be the leading information processing units on earth. Our human brains were able to collect, store, process and emit information in a way that nothing else on earth could. </p><p>But now, there are algorithms. They can collect, store, process and emit far more information than any group of humans ever could. They can now figure out what is wrong and what to do, sometimes far better than we humans can, by learning from information that we humans could not collect, store, process and emit. Algorithms can start movements, manipulate individuals and start revolutions on a global scale. They have become the most powerful entities on earth.</p><p>In fact, because such powerful algorithms are deployed by the most powerful companies which also have huge incentives to make their algorithms more capable, it seems much more likely to me that the first <em>algorithm with superhuman-level world model and planning capabilities</em> will be much more similar to YouTube&apos;s recommendation algorithm than to a robot. Recall that such an algorithm has access to a truly massive amount of data from all over the world. And that data is clearly critical to algorithmic capabilities.</p><p>As another example, an algorithm able to send messages through the internet to get a 3D-printer to print killer drones seem a lot more dangerous than any of the killer drones it creates...</p><p>This is why I believe that the biggest challenges of AI safety and ethics have likely little to do with robots. These challenges rather seem to concern information and information processing. They are about algorithms.</p><p>Not robots. Algorithms.</p><h1>The case of robots is very misleading</h1><p>It would be fine to still focus on robots if they were similar enough to algorithms. In the end, I don&apos;t really care <em>why</em> you would want to solve AI or AGI safety; it just matters (to me) that you do want to solve AI or AGI safety.</p><p>Unfortunately though, having a robot in mind as an example of AI or AGI seems also extremely misleading. In fact, so many AGI safety debates could probably be easily shortcut by focusing on algorithms rather than robots.</p><h2>Distributed algorithms are really hard to interrupt</h2><p>Let&apos;s take the case of safe interruptibility. Many AI safety critics would say that this isn&apos;t a problem, because you can just unplug the AI. Well, admittedly, if a robot is not skillful enough to prevent you from unplugging it, and if you have access to its plug, yes, sure, you could probably unplug it. </p><p>But now try to unplug an algorithm. Especially a <em>distributed </em>algorithm like the YouTube recommendation system or the Google search engine! Even if you were the CEO of Google, I&apos;m skeptical you would be able to interrupt these algorithms.</p><p>There&apos;s worse. Try to unplug Bitcoin. Well, essentially, you would have to unplug all of the Internet... Good luck with that! This is because Bitcoin was designed to be uninterruptible by any small group of users. This is the whole point of designing distributed algorithms! They are designed to be so-called <em>Byzantine-fault tolerant</em>.</p><p>It seems more than reasonable to assume that any algorithm with superhuman-level world knowledge and planning capabilities will make sure it is Byzantine-fault tolerant too.</p><h2>Algorithms work on very different space and time scales</h2><p>Another key feature of robots that is misleading is that we usually expect them to interact with us at our space and time scale. Intuitively, whatever a robot says can be analyzed. And if what he says is suspicious, we could have the time to correct it before it causes harm.</p><p>The case of large-scale algorithms like the YouTube recommendation system is very different. YouTube &quot;speaks&quot; at the rate of millions of recommendations per minute. It &quot;reads&quot; at the rate of 500 hours of videos per minute, and millions of new human behaviours per minute. And YouTube does so on a global scale. </p><p>In particular, this means that no human could ever check even a small fraction of what this algorithm does. The mere oversight of large-scale algorithms is way beyond human capability. We need algorithms for algorithmic surveillance.</p><h2>Today&apos;s algorithms already need alignment!</h2><p>Finally, and perhaps most importantly, robots just aren&apos;t here. Even self-driving cars have yet to be commercialized. In this context, it&apos;s hard to get people to care about AGI risks, or about alignment. The example of robots is not something familiar to them. It&apos;s even associated with science fiction and other futuristic dubious stories.</p><p>Conversely, large-scale hugely influential and sophisticated algorithms are already here. And they&apos;re already changing the world, with massive unpredictable uncontrollable <em>side effects</em>. In fact, it is such <em>side effects</em> of algorithm deployments that are <em>existential risks</em>, especially if algorithms gain superhuman-level world model and planning capabilities.</p><p>Interestingly, today&apos;s algorithms also already pose huge ethical problems that absolutely need to be solved. Whenever a user searches &quot;vaccine&quot;, &quot;Trump&quot; or &quot;AGI risks&quot; on YouTube, there&apos;s an ethical dilemma over which video should be recommended first. Sure, it&apos;s not a life or death solution (though &quot;vaccine&quot; could be). But this occurs billions of times per day! And it might make a young scholar mock AGI risks rather than be concerned about them.</p><p>Perhaps most interestingly to me, <em>alignment</em> (that is, making sure the algorithm&apos;s goal is aligned with ours) already seems critical to make today&apos;s algorithms <em>robustly beneficial</em>. This means that by focusing on the example of today&apos;s algorithms, it may be possible to convince AI safety skeptics to do research that is nevertheless useful to AGI safety. As an added bonus, we wouldn&apos;t need to sacrifice any respectability.</p><p>This is definitely something I&apos;d sign for!</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>In this post, I briefly shared my frustration to see people discuss AIs and robots often in a same sentence, without clear distinction between the two. I think that this attitude is highly counter-productive to the advocacy of AI risks and the research in AI safety. I believe that we should insist a lot more on the importance of information and information processing through <em>algorithms</em>. This seems to me to be a more effective way to promote quality discussion and research on algorithmic alignment.</p>",le-nguyen-hoang-1,le-nguyen-hoang-1,Lê Nguyên Hoang,

I've gone to a lot of effort to explain how this can be without requiring backwards causation (<a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/YpdTSt4kRnuSkn63c/the-prediction-problem-a-variant-on-newcomb-s"">The Prediction Problem</a>, <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/BRuWm4GxcTNPn4XDX/deconfusing-logical-counterfactuals"">Deconfusing Logical Counterfactuals</a>), yet now I find myself wondering if backwards causation is such a bad explanation after all.</p><p>Unfortunately I'm not a physicist, so take what I say with a grain of salt, but I'll sketch out some reasons why backwards causation might not be as ridiculous as it first seems and hopefully someone else develops this in more detail.</p><p>One prominent theory of time is <a href=""https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Eternalism_(philosophy_of_time)"">Eternalism</a> in which there is no objective flow of time and terms like ""past"", ""present"" and ""future"" can only be used in a relative sense. An argument in favour of this is that it is often very convenient in physics to model space-time as a 4-dimensional space. If time is just another dimension, why should the future be treated differently than the past? Nothing in this model differentiates the two. If we have two blocks X and Y next to each other, we can view either X as the left one or Y as the left one depending on the direction we look at it from. Similarly, if A causes B in the traditional forwards sense, why can't we symmetrically view B as backwards causing A, where again if we viewed it another way A to B would be backwards causation and B to A would be forwards causation.</p><p>Another relativistic argument against time flowing is that simultaneity is only defined relative to a reference frame. Therefore, there is no unified present which is supposed to be what is flowing. This doesn't mean that the universe couldn't be described by a unidirectional graph. However, it does greatly undermine any trust in our naive intutions related to time.</p><p>Thirdly, entropy has often been the arrow of time with other physical laws claimed to be reversible. We are in a low-entropy world so entropy increases. However, if we were in a high-entropy world, it would decrease, so time and causation would seem to be going backwards (from our perspective). This would seem to suggest that backwards causation is just as valid a phenomenon as backward causation.</p><p>I want finish by reminding readers again that I am not a physicist. This post is more intended to spark discussion that anything else.</p><p>(Another possibility I haven't discussed is that causation might be in the map rather than the territory)</p>",Chris_Leong,chris_leong,Chris_Leong,

</style></head><body><p>I've been wanting to get a better example of CDT (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_decision_theory"">causal decision theory</a>) misbehaving, where the behaviour is more clearly suboptimal than it is in the <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6ddcsdA2c2XpNpE5x/newcomb-s-problem-and-regret-of-rationality"">Newcomb problem</a> (which many people don't seem to accept as CDT being suboptimal), and simpler to grasp than <a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.05060.pdf"">Death in Damascus</a>.</p>
<h2>The ""predictors exist"" problem</h2>
<p>So consider this simple example: the player is playing against Omega, who will predict their actions<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-L49jER5SnqoGbcrtS-1"" id=""fnref-L49jER5SnqoGbcrtS-1"">[1]</a></sup>. The player can take three actions: ""zero"", ""one"", or ""leave"".</p>
<p>If ever they do ""leave"", then the experiment is over and they leave. If they choose ""zero"" or ""one"", then Omega will predict their action, and compare this to their actual action. If the two match, then the player loses <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""1""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mn""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">1</span></span></span></span></span></span> utility and the game repeats; if the action and the prediction differs, then the player gains <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""3""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mn""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">3</span></span></span></span></span></span> utility and the experiment ends.</p>
<p>Assume that actually Omega is a perfect or quasi-perfect predictor, with a good model of the player. An <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05060"">FDT</a> or EDT agent would soon realise that they couldn't trick Omega, after a few tries, and would quickly end the game.</p>
<p>But the CDT player would be incapable of reaching this reasoning. Whatever distribution they compute over Omega's prediction, they will always estimate that they (the CDT player) have at least a <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""50\%""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mn""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">50</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">%</span></span></span></span></span></span> chance of choosing the other option<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-L49jER5SnqoGbcrtS-2"" id=""fnref-L49jER5SnqoGbcrtS-2"">[2]</a></sup>, for an expected utility gain of at least <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""0.5(3) + 0.5(-1)=1""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mn""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">0.5</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">(</span></span><span class=""mjx-mn""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">3</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">)</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space2""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.298em; padding-bottom: 0.446em;"">+</span></span><span class=""mjx-mn MJXc-space2""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">0.5</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">(</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.298em; padding-bottom: 0.446em;"">−</span></span><span class=""mjx-mn""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">1</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">)</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.077em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">=</span></span><span class=""mjx-mn MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">1</span></span></span></span></span></span>.</p>
<p>Basically, the CDT agent can never learn that Omega is a good predictor of themselves<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-L49jER5SnqoGbcrtS-3"" id=""fnref-L49jER5SnqoGbcrtS-3"">[3]</a></sup>. And so they will continue playing, and continue losing... for ever.</p>

Something that is practical to observe and more likely in the rationalization case than the non-rationalization.</p><p>Some are things which are likely to cause rationalization.  Others are likely to be caused by it.  One on this list is even based on common cause.  (I don&apos;t have any based on selection on a common effect, but in theory there could be.)</p><h1>How to Use Red Flags</h1><p>Seeing a red flag doesn&apos;t necessarily mean that you have rationalized, but it&apos;s evidence.  Likewise, just because you&apos;ve rationalized doesn&apos;t mean your conclusion is wrong, only that it&apos;s not as supported as you thought.</p><p>So when one of these flags raises, don&apos;t give up on ever discovering truth; don&apos;t stop-halt-catch-fire; <em>definitely</em> don&apos;t invert your conclusion.</p><p>Just slow down.  Take the hypothesis that you&apos;re rationalizing seriously and look for ways to test it.  The rest of this sequence will offer tools for the purpose, but just paying attention is half the battle.</p><p>A lot of these things can be present to a greater or lesser degree, so you&apos;ll want to set thresholds.  I&apos;d guess an optimal setting has about 1/3 of triggers be true.  High enough that you keep doing your checks seriously, but low because the payoff matrix is quite asymmetrical.</p><p>Basically use these as <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/wJutA2czyFg6HbYoW/what-are-trigger-action-plans-taps"">trigger-action planning</a>.  Trigger: anything on this list.  Action: spend five seconds doing your agenty best to worry about rationalization.</p><h1>Conflict of Interest</h1><p>This is a classic reason to distrust <em>someone else&apos;s</em> reasoning.  If they have something to gain from you believing a conclusion separate from that conclusion being true, you have reason to be suspicious.  But what does it mean for you to gain from you believing something apart from it being true?</p><h2>Not Such Great Liars</h2><p>Probably the simplest reason is that you need to deceive someone else.  If you&apos;re not a practiced liar, the easiest way to do this is to deceive yourself.</p><p>Simple example: you&apos;re running late and need to give an estimate of when you&apos;ll arrive.  If you say &quot;ten minutes late&quot; and arrive twenty minutes late, it looks like you hit another ten minutes&apos; worth of bad luck, whereas saying &quot;twenty minutes&quot; looks like your fault.  You&apos;re not good at straight-up lying, but if you <em>can convince yourself</em> you&apos;ll only be ten minutes late, all is well.</p><h2>Unendorsed Values</h2><p>Values aren&apos;t simple, and you aren&apos;t always in agreement with yourself.  Let&apos;s illustrate this with examples:</p><p>Perhaps you believe that health and long life are more important that fleeting pleasures like ice cream, but there&apos;s a part of you that has a short time preference and knows ice cream is delicious.  That part would love to convince the rest of you of a theory of nutrition that holds ice cream as healthy.</p><p>Perhaps you believe that you should follow scientific results wherever the evidence leads you, but it seems to be leading someplace that a professor at Duke predicted a few months ago, and there&apos;s a part of you that hates Duke.  If that part can convince the rest of you that the data is wrong, you won&apos;t have to admit that somebody at Duke was right.</p><h2>Wishful Thinking</h2><p>A classic cause of rationalization.  Expecting good things feels better than expecting bad things, so you&apos;ll want to believe it will all come out all right.</p><h2>Catastrophizing Thinking</h2><p>The opposite of wishful thinking.  I&apos;m not sure what the psychological root is, but it seems common in our community.</p><h1>Conflict of Ego</h1><p>The conclusion is: therefore I am a good person.  The virtues I am strong at are the most important, and those I am weak at are the least.  The work I do is vital to upholding civilization.  The actions I took were justified.  See <a href=""https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0265407512472324"">Foster &amp; Misra (2013) on Cognitive Dissonance and Affect</a>.</p><p>Variant: therefore we are good people.  Where &quot;we&quot; can be any group membership the thinker feels strongly about.  Note that the individual need not have been involved in the virtue, work or action to feel pressure to rationalize it.  </p><p>This is particularly insidious when &quot;we&quot; is defined partly by a large set of beliefs, such as the Social Justice Community or the Libertarian Party.  Then it is tempting to rationalize that <em>every position &quot;we&quot; have ever taken was correct</em>.</p><p>In my experience, the communal variant is more common than the individual one, but that may be an artifact of my social circles.</p><h1>Reluctance to Test</h1><p>If you have an opportunity to gain more evidence on the question and feel reluctant, this is a bad sign.  This one is illustrated by <a href=""http://www.hpmor.com/chapter/23"">Harry and Draco discussing Hermione in HPMOR</a> .</p><h1>Suspicious Timing</h1><p>Did you stop looking for alternatives as soon as you found this one?</p><p>Similarly, did you spend a lot longer looking for evidence on one side than the other?</p><h1>Failure to Update</h1><p>This was basically covered in <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/627DZcvme7nLDrbZu/update-yourself-incrementally"">Update Yourself Incrementally</a>  and <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/GSqFqc646rsRd2oyz/p/WN73eiLQkuDtSC8Ag"">One Argument Against An Army</a>.  The pattern of failing to update because the weight of evidence points the other way is a recognizable one.</p><h1>The Feeling of Doing It</h1><p>For some people, rationalization has a distinct subjective experience that you can train yourself to recognize.  Eliezer writes about it in <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CahCppKy9HuXe3j2i/singlethink"">Singlethink</a>  and later <a href=""https://equilibriabook.com/blind-empiricism/"">refers to it</a> as &quot;don&apos;t even start to rationalize&quot;.</p><p>If anyone has experience trying to develop this skill, please leave a comment.</p><h1>Agreeing with Idiots</h1><p>True, reversed stupidity is not intelligence.  Nevertheless, if you find yourself arriving at the same conclusion as a large group of idiots, this is a suspicious observation that calls for an explanation.  Possibilities include:</p><ul><li>It&apos;s a coincidence: they got lucky.  This can happen, but the more complex the conclusion, the less likely.</li><li>They&apos;re not all that idiotic.  People with terrible overall epistemics can still have solid understanding within their comfort zones.</li><li>It&apos;s not really the same conclusion; it just sounds it when both are summarized poorly.</li><li>You and they rationalized the conclusion following the same interest.</li></ul><p>Naturally, it is this last possibility that concerns us.  The less likely the first three, the more worrying the last one.</p><h1>Disagreeing with Experts</h1><p>If someone who is clearly established as an expert in the field (possibly by having notable achievements in it) disagrees with you, this is a bad sign.  It&apos;s more a warning sign of bad logic in general than of rationalization in particular, but rationalization is a common cause of bad logic, and many of the same checks apply.<br></p><hr class=""dividerBlock""><p>Next: <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/YemidbCjjg4w4FRGz/avoiding-rationalization

<p>Anki is a software that helps you learn things and remember them in the long term. Anki can be used to learn a lot of different topics; I successfully used it to learn music, programming languages, mathematics, name of people, and song lyrics. However, ideally, each topic requires one to use Anki differently.</p>
<p>Depending on the interest of the audience, this event will either be a discussion about how we use Anki efficiently, or I will demonstrate the tricks I created and use daily to get the best out of Anki.
Most of my tricks are documented on <a href=""http://www.milchior.fr/blog_en/index.php/category/Anki"">http://www.milchior.fr/blog_en/index.php/category/Anki</a></p>

<p>Anki is a spaced-repetition software that helps people to remember things in the long term. For example, Anki is often used to learn foreign languages and
medicine, which both require a lot of memorization. Starting to use Anki
may be a little bit tricky and the goal of this event is to help you explore and try the software to see whether you like it.</p>
<p>For the first part, I'll help guide the audience through setting up Anki.</p>
<p>Then, I'll quickly show personal examples explaining how Anki changed my life in many ways, to illustrate what can be done with it. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>I now remember the name of people I meet,</li>
<li>I can finally play some music without music sheets, and</li>
<li>when I start studying more of a topic after a few months of pauses
(mathematics, CS, music theory,...) I don't forget everything I learned months ago!</li>
</ul>
<p>Afterwards, I will be available to answer any beginner question (if there is any question you already know you have, please ask it to <a href=""mailto:arthur@milchior.fr"">arthur@milchior.fr</a> or in comment below, or on <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/events/3085385471685929/?active_tab=discussion"">facebook</a>.

7oLZh78Et9xRC5aHi,Repossessing Degrees,repossessing-degrees,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7oLZh78Et9xRC5aHi/repossessing-degrees,2020-01-13T21:40:01.884Z,16,10,18,False,False,,"<p>

Several months ago I 

<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/fixing-student-loans"">argued that</a>
we should allow student loans to be discharged through bankruptcy.
Yesterday I 

<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22030340"">realized</a>
another way to modify student loans to be more compatible with
bankruptcy: allow lenders to effectively repossess degrees.  This could
make having student loans not survive bankruptcy more politically
practical.



</p><p>

Sometimes people <a href=""http://www.ajeforum.com/can-a-higher-education-be-repossessed-katie-crabtree/"">bring</a>
<a href=""https://pjmedia.com/lifestyle/2016/07/01/take-my-degree-please/"">up</a>
the idea of repossessing degrees as a way of illustrating the
absurdity of student loans, but it's actually pretty reasonable.  A
large majority of the benefit of getting a degree comes from <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheepskin_effect"">having the
credential</a> as opposed to having learned skills: employers use ""do
they have a college degree"" as a filter.  If you took out a student
loan to get a degree, and then later declared bankruptcy, the court
could require you to no longer represent yourself as having a the
degree as a condition of having your debt discharged.

</p>

<p>

I think the goal is that someone with a repossessed degree should look
the same as someone who completed part of the degree but dropped out
before finishing.  Colleges would need to be part of this as well; one
way for this to work is if as a condition of continued participation
in the student loan system colleges would need to agree to revoke
degrees if asked to do so by the bankruptcy court.

</p>

<p>

One way this could work poorly would be if people would just ignore
the law and tell employers in person that they have a revoked degree?
I think they mostly wouldn't: degrees are often used at an early stage
of hiring screening, where if you don't have a degree you don't even
get to the stage of being able to talk to an interviewer and explain
the situation.  Additionally, someone who decides to claim they went
to Harvard after having their degree repossessed looks just like
someone who's lying about having gone to college, or who dropped out.

</p>

<p>

This would probably need to be combined with some sort of waiting
period, something like five years, to avoid the case where someone
declares bankruptcy before finishing their degree when there's nothing
to repossess, and then completes their degree later.

</p>

<p>

Implementing this in a way compatible with the first amendment seems
tricky but doable. In a standard <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-disclosure_agreement"">non-disclosure
agreement</a> you trade your right to share some information for
something else you value more.  That's what we're talking about here,
so it seems like we're ok?  But I'm just speculating.

</p>

<p>

This does change some of the incentives around education and hiring:
students might try to learn valuable skills, and employers might try
to evaluate people based on what they know and can do.  But this would
be a great outcome!

</p>

<p>

(Note that this is not compatible with my <a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/fixing-student-loans"">proposal</a> that we prohibit employers
from considering degrees entirely, and is a much less radical
alternative.)

<p>We are often forced to make decisions under conditions of uncertainty. This may be empirical uncertainty (e.g., what is the likelihood that nuclear war would cause human extinction?), or it may be moral uncertainty (e.g., does the wellbeing of future generations matter morally?).</p>
<p>In <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/oZsyK4SjnPe6HGia8/moral-uncertainty-vs-related-concepts"">my prior post</a>, I discussed overlaps with and distinctions between moral uncertainty and related concepts. In this post, I continue my attempt to clarify <strong>what moral uncertainty actually <em>is</em></strong> (rather than how to make decisions when morally uncertain, which is <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/4NFwxwzLzpiikfkk3/p/dX7vNKg4vex5vxWCW"">covered later in the sequence</a>). Specifically, here I’ll discuss:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is what we “ought to do” (or “should do”) under moral uncertainty an <em>objective</em> or <em>subjective</em> (i.e., <em>belief-relative</em>) matter?</li>
<li>Is what we “ought to do” (or “should do”) under moral uncertainty a matter of <em>rationality</em> or <em>morality</em>?</li>
</ol>
<p>An important aim will be simply clarifying the questions and terms themselves. That said, to foreshadow, the tentative “answers” I’ll arrive at are:</p>
<ol>
<li>It seems both more intuitive and more action-guiding to say that the “ought” is <em>subjective</em>.</li>
<li>Whether the “ought” is a rational or a moral one may be a “merely verbal” dispute with no practical significance. But I’m very confident that interpreting the “ought” as a matter of <em>rationality</em> works in any case (i.e., whether or not interpreting it as a matter of <em>morality</em> does, and whether or not the distinction really matters).</li>
</ol>
<p>This post <em>doesn’t</em> explicitly address what types of moral uncertainty would be <em>meaningful for moral antirealists and/or subjectivists</em>; I discuss that topic in <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/s6BGofzFbEr4Tmxkj/value-uncertainty"">a separate post</a>.<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-kNWLvon2PLqKXpPde-1"" id=""fnref-kNWLvon2PLqKXpPde-1"">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Epistemic status: The concepts covered here are broad, fuzzy, and overlap in various ways, making definitions and distinctions between them almost inevitably debatable. Additionally, I’m not an expert in these topics (though I have now spent a couple weeks mostly reading about them). I’ve tried to mostly collect, summarise, and synthesise <strong>existing</strong> ideas (from academic philosophy and the LessWrong and EA communities). I’d appreciate feedback or comments in relation to any mistakes, unclear phrasings, etc. (and just in general!).</em></p>
<h1>Objective or subjective?</h1>
<p><em>(Note: What I discuss here is <strong>not</strong> the same as the objectivism vs subjectivism debate <strong>in metaethics</strong>.)</em></p>
<p>As I noted in <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/dXT5G9xEAddac8H2J/morality-vs-related-concepts"">a prior post</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Subjective</em> normativity relates to what one should do <em>based on what one believes</em>, whereas <em>objective</em> normativity relates to what one “actually” should do (i.e., based on the true state of affairs).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href=""https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/Greaves_Cotton-Barratt_bargaining_theoretic_approach.pdf"">Hilary Greaves &amp; Owen Cotton-Barratt</a> give an example of this distinction in the context of <em>empirical</em> uncertainty:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Suppose Alice packs the waterproofs but, as the day turns out, it does not rain. Does it follow that Alice made the wrong decision? In one (<strong>objective</strong>) sense of “wrong”, yes: thanks to that decision, she experienced the mild but unnecessary inconvenience of carrying bulky raingear around all day. But in a second (more <strong>subjective</strong>) sense, clearly it need not follow that the decision was wrong: if the probability of rain was sufficiently high and Alice sufficiently dislikes getting wet, her decision could easily be the appropriate one to make given her state of ignorance about how the weather would in fact turn out. Normative theories of decision-making under uncertainty aim to capture this second, more subjective, type of evaluation; the standard such account is expected utility theory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Greaves &amp; Cotton-Barratt then make the analogous distinction for <em>moral</em> uncertainty:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How should one choose, when facing relevant <strong>moral</strong> uncertainty? In one (<strong>objective</strong>) sense, of course, what one should do is simply what the true moral hypothesis says one should do. But it seems there is also a second sense of “should”, analogous to the <strong>subjective</strong> “should” for empirical uncertainty, capturing the sense in which it is appropriate for the agent facing moral uncertainty to be guided by her moral credences [i.e., beliefs], whatever the moral facts may be. (emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(This objective vs subjective distinction seems to me somewhat similar - though not identical - to the distinction between <a href=""https://conceptually.org/concepts/ex-ante-vs-ex-post-analysis""><em>ex post</em> and <em>ex ante</em> thinking</a>. We might say that Alice made the right decision <em>ex ante</em> - i.e., based on what she knew when she made her decision - even if it <em>turned out</em> - <em>ex post</em> - that the other decision would’ve worked out better.)</p>
<p><a href=""http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/MacAskill-Normative-Uncertainty.pdf"">MacAskill</a> notes that, in both the empirical and moral contexts, “The principal argument for thinking that there must be a subjective sense of ‘ought’ is because the objective sense of ‘ought’ is not sufficiently action-guiding.” He illustrates this in the case of moral uncertainty with the following example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Susan is a doctor, who faces three sick individuals, Greg, Harold and Harry. Greg is a human patient, whereas Harold and Harry are chimpanzees. They all suffer from the same condition. She has a vial of a drug, D. If she administers all of drug D to Greg, he will be completely cured, and if she administers all of drug to the chimpanzees, they will both be completely cured (health 100%). If she splits the drug between the three, then Greg will be almost completely cured (health 99%), and Harold and Harry will be partially cured (health 50%). She is unsure about the value of the welfare of non-human animals: she thinks it is equally likely that chimpanzees’ welfare has no moral value and that chimpanzees’ welfare has the same moral value as human welfare. And, let us suppose, there is no way that she can improve her epistemic state with respect to the relative value of humans and chimpanzees.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[...]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Her three options are as follows:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A: Give all of the drug to Greg</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>B: Split the drug</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>C: Give all of the drug to Harold and Harry</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Her decision can be represented in the following table, using numbers to represent how good each outcome would be.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/dwbqmbkdb/image/upload/v1578916362/Chimp_table_a33dg3.png"" alt=""""></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Finally, suppose that, according to the true moral theory, chimpanzee welfare is of the same moral value as human welfare and that therefore, she should give all of the drug to Harold and Harry. What should she do?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clearly, the best <em>outcome</em> would occur if Susan does C. But she doesn’t <em>know</em> that that would cause the best outcome, because she doesn’t <em>know</em> what the “true moral theory” is. She thus has no way to act on the advice “Just do what is <em>objectively</em> morally right.” Meanwhile, as MacAskill notes, “it seems it would be morally reckless for Susan <strong>not</strong> to choose option B: given what she knows, she would be risking severe wrongdoing by choosing either option A or option C” (emphasis added).</p>
<p>To capture the intuition the Susan should choose option B, and <strong>to provide <em>actually followable</em> guidance for action, we need to accept that there is a <em>subjective</em> sense of “should”</strong> (or of “ought”) - a sense of “should” that <em>depends in part on what one believes</em>. (This could also be called a “belief-relative” or “credence-relative” sense of “should”.)<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-kNWLvon2PLqKXpPde-2"" id=""fnref-kNWLvon2PLqKXpPde-2"">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>An additional argument in favour of accepting that there’s a subjective “should” in relation to moral uncertainty is consistency with how we treat <em>empirical</em> uncertainty, where most people accept that there’s a subjective “should”.<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-kNWLvon2PLqKXpPde-3"" id=""fnref-kNWLvon2PLqKXpPde-3"">[3]</a></sup> This argument is made regularly, including by MacAskill and by Greaves &amp; Cotton-Barratt, and it seems particularly compelling when one considers that it’s often difficult to draw clear lines between empirical and moral uncertainty (see <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/oZsyK4SjnPe6HGia8/moral-uncertainty-vs-related-concepts"">my prior post</a>). That is, if it’s often hard to say whether an uncertainty is empirical or moral, it seems strange to say we should accept a subjective “should” under empirical uncertainty but <em>not</em> under moral uncertainty.</p>
<p>Ultimately, most of what I’ve read on moral uncertainty is premised on there being a subjective sense of “should”, and much of this sequence will rest on that premise also.<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-kNWLvon2PLqKXpPde-4"" id=""fnref-kNWLvon2PLqKXpPde-4"">[4]</a></sup> As far as I can tell, this seems necessary if we are to come up with any meaningful, action-guiding <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/dX7vNKg4vex5vxWCW/making-decisions-under-moral-uncertainty-1"">approaches for decision-making under moral uncertainty</a> (“metanormative theories”).</p>
<p>But I should note that <em>some</em> writers <em>do</em> appear to argue that there’s only an objective sense of “should” (one example, I think, is <a href=""https://philpapers.org/archive/WEARRM.pdf"">Weatherson</a>, though he uses different language and I’ve only skimmed his paper). Furthermore, while I can’t see how this could lead to action-guiding principles for <em>making decisions under uncertainty</em>, it does seem to me that it’d still allow for <em>resolving</em> one’s uncertainty. In other words, if we do recognise only objective “oughts”:</p>
<ul>
<li>We may be stuck with fairly useless principles for decision-making, such as “Just do what’s actually right, even when you don’t know what’s actually right”</li>
<li>But (as far as I can tell) we could still be guided to <em>clarify</em> and <em>reduce</em> our uncertainties, and thereby bring our beliefs more in line with what’s actually right.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Rational or moral?</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>There is also debate about what precisely kind of “should” is involved [in cases of moral uncertainty]: rational, moral, or something else again. (<a href=""https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/Greaves_Cotton-Barratt_bargaining_theoretic_approach.pdf"">Greaves &amp; Cotton-Barratt</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example, in the above example of Susan the doctor, are we wondering what she <em>rationally</em> ought to do, given her moral uncertainty about the moral status of chimpanzees, or what she <em>morally</em> ought to do?</p>
<h2>It may not matter either way</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, even after having read up on this, it’s not actually clear to me what the distinction is meant to be. In particular, I haven’t come across a clear explanation of what it would mean for the “should” or “ought” to be <em>moral</em>. I suspect that what that would mean would be partly a matter of interpretation, and that some definitions of a “moral” should could be effectively the same as those for a “rational” should. (But I should note that I didn’t look exhaustively for such explanations and definitions.)</p>
<p>Additionally, both Greaves &amp; Cotton-Barratt and <a href=""http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/MacAskill-Normative-Uncertainty.pdf"">MacAskill</a> explicitly avoid the question of whether what one “ought to do” under moral uncertainty is a matter of rationality or morality.<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-kNWLvon2PLqKXpPde-5"" id=""fnref-kNWLvon2PLqKXpPde-5"">[5]</a></sup> This does not seem to at all hold them back from making valuable contributions to the literature on moral uncertainty (and, more specifically, on how to make decisions when morally uncertain).</p>
<p>Together, the above points make me <strong>inclined to believe (though with low confidence) that this may be a “merely verbal” debate with no real, practical implications</strong> (at least while the words involved remain as fuzzy as they are).</p>
<p>However, I still did come to two less-dismissive conclusions:</p>
<ol>
<li>I’m very confident that the project of working out meaningful, action-guiding principles for decision-making under moral uncertainty <strong>makes sense if we see the relevant “should” as a rational one</strong>. (Note: This doesn’t mean that I think the “should” <em>has</em> to be seen as a rational one.)</li>
<li>I’m less sure whether that project would make sense if we see the relevant “should” as a moral one. (Note: This doesn’t mean I have any particular reason to believe it <em>wouldn’t</em> make sense if we see the “should” as a moral one.)</li>
</ol>
<p>I provide my reasoning behind these conclusions below, though, given my sense that this debate may lack practical significance, <strong>some readers may wish to just skip to the next section</strong>.</p>
<h2>A rational “should” likely works</h2>
<p><a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/phc3.12408"">Bykvist</a> writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An alternative way to understand the ought relevant to moral uncertainty is in terms of rationality (MacAskillet al., forthcoming; Sepielli, 2013). Rationality, in one important sense at least, has to do with what one should do or intend, given one’s beliefs and preferences. This is the kind of rationality that decision theory often is seen as invoking. It can be spelled out in different ways. One is to see it as a matter of coherence: It is rational to do or intend what coheres with one’s beliefs and preferences (Broome, 2013; for a critic, see Arpaly, 2000). Another way to spell it out is to understand it as matter of rational processes: it is rational to do or intend what would be the output of a rational process, which starts with one’s beliefs and preferences (Kolodny, 2007).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To apply the general idea to moral uncertainty, we do not need to take stand on which version is correct. We only need to assume that when a conscientious moral agent faces moral uncertainty, she cares about doing right and avoid doing wrong but is uncertain about the moral status of her actions. She prefers doing right to doing wrong and is indifferent between different right doings (at least when the right doings have the same moral value, that is, none is morally supererogatory). She also cares more about serious wrongdoings than minor wrongdoings. The idea is then to apply traditional decision theoretical principles, according to which rational choice is some function of the agent’s preferences (utilities) and beliefs (credences). Of course, different decision‐theories provide different principles (and require different kinds of utility information). But the plausible ones at least agree on cases where one option dominates another.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Suppose that you are considering only two theories (which is to simplify considerably, but we only need a logically possible case): “business as usual,” according to which it is permissible to eat factory‐farmed meat and permissible to eat vegetables, and “vegetarianism,” according to which it is impermissible to eat factory‐farmed meat and permissible to eat vegetables. Suppose further that you have slightly more confidence in “business as usual.” The option of eating vegetables will dominate the option of eating meat in terms of your own preferences: No matter which moral theory is true, by eating vegetables, you will ensure an outcome that you weakly [prefer] to the alternative outcome: if “vegetarianism” is true, you prefer the outcome; if “business as usual is true,” you are indifferent between the outcomes. The rational thing for you to do is thus to eat vegetables, given your beliefs and preferences. (lines breaks added)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems to me that that reasoning makes perfect sense, and that we can have valid, meaningful, action-guiding principles about what one <em>rationally</em> (and subjectively) should do given one’s moral uncertainty. This seems further supported by the approach <a href=""https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1c29/5c1c2e8eda8eb41560feb9f927104a6a6a85.pdf"">Christian Tarsney</a> takes, which seems to be useful and to also treat the relevant “should” as a rational one.</p>
<p>Furthermore, <a href=""http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/MacAskill-Normative-Uncertainty.pdf"">MacAskill</a> seems to suggest that there’s a correlation between (a) writers fully engaging with the project of working out action-guiding principles for decision-making under moral uncertainty and (b) writers considering the relevant “should” to be rational (rather than moral):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(Lockhart 2000, 24,26), (Sepielli 2009, 10) and (Ross 2006) all take metanormative norms to be norms of rationality. (Weatherson 2014) and (Harman 2014) both understand metanormative norms as moral norms. So there is an odd situation in the literature where the defenders of metanormavism (Lockhart, Ross, and Sepielli) and the critics of the view (Weatherson and Harman) seem to be talking past one another.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>A moral “should” may or may not work</h2>
<p>I haven’t seen any writer (a) <em>explicitly</em> state that they understand the relevant “should” to be a moral one, and then (b) go on to fully engage with the project of working out meaningful, action-guiding principles for decision-making under moral uncertainty. Thus, I have an absence of evidence that one can engage in that project while seeing the “should” as moral, and <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/mnS2WYLCGJP2kQkRn/absence-of-evidence-is-evidence-of-absence"">I take this as (very weak) evidence</a> that one can’t engage in that project while seeing the “should” that way.</p>
<p>Additionally, as noted above, MacAskill writes that Weatherson and Harman (who seem fairly dismissive of that project) see the relevant “should” as a moral one. Arguably, this is evidence that that project of finding such action-guiding principles won’t make sense if we see the “should” as moral (rather than rational). However, I consider this to <em>also</em> be very weak evidence, because:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<h1>Closing remarks</h1>
<p>In this post, I’ve aimed to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clarify what is meant by the question “Is what we “ought to do” under moral uncertainty is an <em>objective</em> or <em>subjective</em> matter?”</li>
<li>Clarify what is meant by the question “Is that ‘ought’ a matter of <em>rationality</em> or of <em>morality</em>?”</li>
<li>Argue that it seems both more intuitive and more action-guiding to say that the “ought” is <em>subjective</em>.</li>
<li>Argue that whether the “ought” is a rational or a moral one may be a “merely verbal” dispute with no practical significance (but that interpreting the “ought” as a matter of <em>rationality</em> works in any case).</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope this has helped give readers more clarity on the seemingly neglected matter of what we actually <em>mean</em> by moral uncertainty. (And as always, I’d welcome any feedback or comments!)</p>
<p>My next posts will continue in a similar vein, but this time building to the question of whether, when we’re talking about moral uncertainty, we’re actually talking about <em>moral risk</em> rather than about <em>moral (Knightian) uncertainty</em> - and whether such a distinction is truly meaningful. (To do so, I'll first discuss the risk-uncertainty distinction <em>in general</em>, and the related matter of unknown unknowns, before applying these ideas in the context of <em>moral</em> risk/uncertainty in particular.)</p>

The following quote, while not directly addressing that <em>exact</em> distinction, seems relevant:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Before moving on, we should distinguish subjective credences, that is, degrees of belief, from epistemic credences, that is, the degree of belief that one is epistemically justified in having, given one’s evidence. When I use the term ‘credence’ I refer to epistemic credences (though much of my discussion could be applied to a parallel discussion involving subjective credences); when I want to refer to subjective credences I use the term ‘degrees of belief’.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The reason for this is that appropriateness seems to have some sort of normative force: if it is most appropriate for someone to do something, it seems that, other things being equal, they ought, in the relevant sense of ‘ought’, to do it. But people can have crazy beliefs: a psychopath might think that a killing spree is the most moral thing to do. But there’s no sense in which the psychopath ought to go on a killing spree: rather, he ought to revise his beliefs. We can only capture that idea if we talk about epistemic credences, rather than degrees of belief.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not everyone does recognise a subjective reading of the moral ‘ought’, even in the case of empirical uncertainty. One can distinguish between objectivist, (rational-)credence-relative and pluralist views on this matter. According to objectivists (Moore, 1903; Moore, 1912; Ross, 1930, p.32; Thomson, 1986, esp. pp. 177-9; Graham, 2010; Bykvist and Olson, 2011) (respectively, credence-relativists (Prichard, 1933; Ross, 1939; Howard-Snyder, 2005; Zimmermann, 2006; Zimmerman, 2009; Mason, 2013), the “ought” of morality is uniquely an objective (respectively, a credence-relative) one. According to pluralists, “ought” is ambiguous between these two readings (Russell, 1966; Gibbard, 2005; Parfit, 2011; Portmore, 2011; Dorsey, 2012; Olsen, 2017), or varies between the two readings according to context (Kolodny and Macfarlane, 2010).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One possible explanation of why so few philosophers have engaged with moral uncertainty might be serious doubt about whether it makes much sense to ask about what one ought do when one is uncertain about what one ought to do. The obvious answer to this question might be thought to be: “you ought to do what you ought to do, no matter whether or not you are certain about it” (Weatherson, 2002, 2014). However, this assumes the same sense of “ought” throughout.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A better option is to assume that there are different kinds of moral ought. We are asking what we morally ought to do, in one sense of ought, when we are not certain about what we morally ought to do, in another sense of ought. One way to make this idea more precise is to think about the different senses as different levels of moral ought. When we face a moral problem, we are asking what we morally ought to do, at the first level. Standard moral theories, such as utilitarianism, Kantianism, and virtue ethics, provide answers to this question. In a case of moral uncertainty, we are moving up one level and asking about what we ought to do, at the second level, when we are not sure what we ought to do at the first level. At this second level, we take into account our credence in various hypotheses about what we ought to do at the first level and what these hypotheses say about the moral value of each action (MacAskill et al., forthcoming). This second level ought provides a way to cope with the moral uncertainty at the first level. It gives us a verdict of how to best manage the risk of doing first order moral wrongs. That there is such a second‐level moral ought of coping with first‐order moral risks seems to be supported by the fact that agents are morally criticizable when they, knowing all the relevant empirical facts, do what they think is very likely to be a first‐order moral wrong when there is another option that is known not to pose any risk of such wrongdoing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet another (and I think similar) way of framing this sort of distinction could make use of the following two terms: “A criterion of rightness tells us what it takes for an action to be right (if it’s actions we’re looking at). A decision procedure is something that we use when we’re thinking about what to do” (<a href=""https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/voDm6e6y4KHAPJeJX/act-utilitarianism-criterion-of-rightness-vs-decision"">Askell</a>).</p>
<p>Specifically, we might say that the true first-order moral theory provides objective “criteria of rightness”, but that we don’t have direct access to what these are. As such, we can use a second-order “decision procedure” that attempts to lead us to take actions that are close as possible to the best actions (according to the unknown criteria of rightness). To do so, this decision procedure must make use of our credences (beliefs) in various moral theories, and is thus subjective. <a href=""#fnref-kNWLvon2PLqKXpPde-4"" class=""footnote-backref"">↩︎</a></p>

6vaiBdmKaG35S9tK9,Why a New Rationalization Sequence?,why-a-new-rationalization-sequence,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6vaiBdmKaG35S9tK9/why-a-new-rationalization-sequence,2020-01-13T06:46:33.813Z,30,8,8,False,False,,"<p>This is the first in a five-post mini-sequence about rationalization, which I intend to post one-per-day.  And you may ask, why should we have such a sequence?</p><h1>What is Rationalization and Why is it Bad?</h1><p>For those of you just tuning in, rationalization is when you take a conclusion you want to reach and try to come up with a argument that concludes it.  The argument looks very similar to one in which you started from data, evaluated as well as you could, and reached this conclusion naturally.  Almost always similar enough to fool the casual observer, and often similar enough to <em>fool yourself.</em></p><p>If you&apos;re deliberately rationalizing for an outside audience, that&apos;s out-of-scope for this sequence.  All the usual ethics and game theory apply.</p><p>But if you&apos;re involuntarily rationalizing and fooling yourself, then you&apos;ve failed at epistemics.  And your arts have <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/GSqFqc646rsRd2oyz/p/AdYdLP2sRqPMoe8fb  "">turned against you</a>.  Know a lot about scientific failures?  Now you can find them in <em>all </em>the studies you didn&apos;t like!</p><h1>Didn&apos;t Eliezer Already Do This?</h1><p>Eliezer wrote the <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/GSqFqc646rsRd2oyz"">against rationalization</a> sequence back in 2007/8.  If you haven&apos;t read it, you probably should.  It does a good job of describing what rationalization is, how it can happen, and how bad it can be.  It does <em>not</em> provide a lot of tools for you to use in protecting yourself from rationalization.  That&apos;s what I&apos;ll be focusing on here.</p><p>And, besides, if we don&apos;t revisit a topic this important every decade or so with new developments, then what is this community for?</p><h1>Is There Hope?</h1><p>Periodically, I hear someone give up on logical argument completely.  &quot;You can find an argument for anything,&quot; they say, &quot;Forget logic.  Trust [ your gut / tradition / me ] instead.&quot;  Which brushes over the question of whether the proposed alternative is any better.  There is no royal road to knowledge.</p><p>Still, the question needs answering.  If rationalization looks just like logic, can we ever escape Cartesian Doubt?</p><h2>The Psychiatrist Paradox</h2><p>A common delusion among grandiose schizophrenics in institutions is that they are themselves psychiatrists.  Consider a particularly underfunded mental hospital, in which the majority of people who &quot;know&quot; themselves to be psychiatrists are wrong.  No examination of the evidence will convince them otherwise.  No matter how overwhelming, some reason to disbelieve will be found.</p><p>Given this, should any amount of evidence suffice to convince you that you are such a psychiatrist?</p><p>I am not aware of any resolution to this paradox.</p><h2>The Dreaming Paradox</h2><p>But the Psychiatrist Paradox is based on an <em>absolute</em> fixed belief and <em>total</em> rationalization as seen in theoretically ideal schizophrenics.  (How closely do real-world schizophrenics approximate this ideal?  That question is beyond the scope of this document.)  Let&apos;s consider people a little more reality-affiliated: the dreaming.</p><p>Given that any evidence of awakeness is a thing that can be dreamed, should you ever be more than 90% confident you&apos;re awake?  (Assuming 16 hours awake and 2 dreaming in a typical 24 hour period.)</p><p>(Boring answer: forget confidence, always <em>act on the assumption</em> that you&apos;re awake because it&apos;s erring on the side of safety.  We&apos;ll come back to this thought.)</p><p>(Also boring: most lucid dreaming enthusiasts report they do find evidence of wakefulness or dreaminess which dreams never forge.  Assume you haven&apos;t found any for yourself.)</p><p>Here&apos;s my test: I ask my computer to prime factor a large number (around ten digits) and check it by hand.  I can dream many things, but I&apos;m not going to dream that my computer doesn&apos;t have the <code>factor</code> program, nor will I forget how to multiply.  And I <em>can&apos;t</em> dream that it factored correctly, because I can&apos;t factor numbers that big.</p><p>You can&apos;t outsmart an absolute tendency to rationalize, but you can outsmart a <em>finite</em> one.  Which, I suspect, is what we mostly have.</p><h1>A Disclaimer Regarding Authorship</h1><p>Before I start on the meat of the sequence (in the next post) I should make clear that not all these ideas are mine.  Unfortunately, I&apos;ve lost track of which ones are and which aren&apos;t, and of who proposed the ones which aren&apos;t.  And the ones that aren&apos;t original to me have still gone through me enough to not be entirely as their original authors portrayed them.</p><p>If I tried to untangle this mess and credit properly, I&apos;d never get this written.  So onward.  If you wish to fix some bit of crediting, leave a comment and I&apos;ll try to do something sensible.</p><h1>Beyond Rationalization</h1><p>Much of what appears here also applies to ordinary mistakes of logic.  I&apos;ll try to tag such as they go.</p><p>The simplest ideal of thinking deals extensively with uncertainty of external facts, but trusts its own reasoning implicitly.  Directly imitating this, when your own reasoning is not 100% trustworthy, is a bad plan.  Hopefully this sequence will provide some alternatives.</p><hr class=""dividerBlock""><p>Next: <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ZE8F3FtcoEqih74pu/red-flags-for-rationalization"">Red Flags for Rationalization</a> </p>",dspeyer,dspeyer,dspeyer,

I&apos;m a largely improvisational speaker though, and it quickly turned into a discussion of the future of the movement.</p><p>I&apos;m pretty old now, and I&apos;ve seen a number of groups of people move from relative obscurity, to positions of power or, at least, to being subjects of general curiosity. The most relevant, I think, for rationalists are the early (pre-2002) Googlers.</p><p>If a social group gets projected onto the broader canvas of mass attention, or their interests get magnified through access to the levers of power, you get criticism and praise in varied amounts (Paul Graham has just <a href=""http://paulgraham.com/fh.html"">written a piece about this</a>). But just as visibly, the tiniest omissions and imperfections of the analysis and attitudes of the founders are also magnified.</p><p>I gave a talk in, I think, 2009, about this at a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foo_Camp"">Foo Camp</a>. I warned in an environment that was ready to hear it, but not capable of changing matters much, that geeks were about to become dangerous: that we had a set of Tragic Flaws, that we were already seeing magnified in the wider world. </p><p>I don&apos;t remember all of the characteristics of geekdom I gave then that would lead to its downfall, but a couple of them stuck with me: that we were bending the workplace into our own vision of a pleasant place to be (unbounded by the 9-5, contract-driven, full of interest and unboring, self-driven, university-like), and that meant that we were work-focused, and pushing others to be (even when their lives could not be bent that way). We experienced burn-out as a part of our lives, and now we were driving others into burn-out. We viewed efficiency as a life goal for ourselves, individually, and that was how we were encouraging others to live. We were strongly influenced by our alienation from others as young people, and that meant (paradoxically) that when we did assume power, we would not recognise it, and instead continued to use the habits and attitudes of outsiders with no power. (I called this &quot;Stalinism&quot;: Stalin&apos;s paranoia and cruelty may have come from being the weak, minority group experiencing cruelty from the more powerful. I&apos;m not sure if that is truly the case, but perhaps we could give as a better example Bill Gates, who for years assumed that Microsoft had to act as a scrappy competitor, because it was weak, and could easily be destroyed by IBM -- even when it reached the point of dominating the PC market.</p><p>I see the same dynamic playing out among rationalists now. Dominic Cummings will not be the last powerbroker who will see the rationalist point-of-view as providing an edge <a href=""https://dominiccummings.com/2020/01/02/two-hands-are-a-lot-were-hiring-data-scientists-project-managers-policy-experts-assorted-weirdos/"">that can be swiftly adopted</a>. At my talk at the Solstice unconference, I described this opportunity as emerging from rationalists appearance as being similar to the existing powerful groups (well-educated, mildly secular, polite, verbal) -- but also seemingly &quot;harmless&quot;. </p><p>This is important, because some groups who seek to transform society are quickly beaten down with baseball bats, because of either their unfamiliarity, or being all too easily pattern-matched as &quot;dangerous&quot; radicals.(I may have noted that everyone at the Unconference looked like the radical unitarians from Unsong, whose very existence in the book was to play up the joke of how un-dangerous they seemed.)</p><p>What this means is that rationalist ideas, even as they are disparaged as weird by the first waves of media, will be far more quickly adopted by enclaves of the powerful than one might expect. Or might be healthy for anyone involved. If Bill Gates, or Googlers (or Stalin!) go from being unforeseen upstarts to being able to affect world events in a decade or two, that means that those minor flaws turn into tragedies without being addressed or corrected. </p><p>Rationalists have an advantage of their own internal warning system. You have, as they say, <a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/04/07/yes-we-have-noticed-the-skulls/"">noticed the skulls</a>. So what are the heroic flaws, the blindspots, the monocultural assumptions that will lead to the movement&apos;s downfall?</p><br>",hiblick,hiblick,hiblick,

The idea of gradient descent is that the gradient points into the direction of fastest positive change, thus the opposite of the gradient is the direction of fastest negative change. It follows that, to minimize a function, one can start anywhere, compute the gradient, and then move into the opposite direction.</p><span><figure><img src=""https://s19.directupload.net/images/200101/zd552qnc.jpg"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:40%""></figure></span><p>In the above example, the function goes up, therefore the derivative is positive, therefore the gradient points rightward. Gradient Descent tells us to go into the opposite direction, i.e. leftwards. Indeed, leftward is where the function decreases. Clearly, this is a display of utter brilliance.</p><p>Importantly, note that the picture is misleading insofar as it suggests there are more directions than two.

Therefore, it cannot point upward or downward.</p><p>As silly as the one-dimensional case is, it quickly becomes less trivial as we increase the dimension. Consider this function (picture taken from Wikipedia): </p><span><figure><img src=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/3d-gradient-cos.svg/525px-3d-gradient-cos.svg.png"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:40%""></figure></span><p>Again, the gradient lives in the domain space, which is <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\mathbb{R}^2""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-texatom""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-ams-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">R</span></span></span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sup"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: 0.615em; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mn"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">2</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>, as this image illustrates nicely. Thus it cannot point upward or downward; however, it can point into any direction within the flat plane. If we look at a point on this function, it is not immediately obvious in which direction one should move to obtain the fastest possible decrease of its function value. But if we look at the little arrows (the gradients at different domain points), they tell us the direction of the fastest positive change. If we reverse them, we get the direction of the fastest negative change.</p><p>The following is important to keep in mind: in the context of Machine Learning, <em>the domain space for our loss function is the space of all possibe hypotheses</em>. So the domain is itself a function space. What we want to do is to minimize a function (a loss function) that takes a function (a predictor, properly parametrized), as an argument, and outputs the performance of that predictor on the real world. For example, if we allow predictors of the form <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""h(x) = ax^2 + bx + c""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em;

The remaining question is whether or not it will perform well. The most important property here is certainly the convexity of the loss function because that is what guarantees that the predictor will not get stuck in a local minimum, which could otherwise easily happen (the negative gradient will just keep pushing us back toward that local minimum).</p><p>In the previous chapter, we introduced the classes of <em>convex Lipschitz bounded</em> and <em>convex smooth bounded</em> problems. For both of these, one can derive upper-bounds on the expected error of a classifier trained via stochastic gradient descent for a certain number of steps. In the remainder of this chapter, we will do one of those proofs, namely the one for convex smooth bounded problems. This is an arbitrary choice; both proofs are technical and difficult, and unfortunately also quite different, so we&apos;re not doing both.</p><h1>Deriving an upper-bound on the Error</h1><p>The proof which upper-bounds the expected real error is of the kind that I usually don&apos;t work out in detail because it just doesn&apos;t seem worth it. On the other hand, I don&apos;t want difficult proofs to be excluded in principle. So this will be an experiment of how my style of dissecting each problem until its pieces are sufficiently small works out if applied to a proof that seems to resist intuitive understanding. In any case, working through this proof is not required to understand Stochastic Gradient Descent, so you might end this chapter here.</p><p>Now let us begin.</p><h2>The plan</h2><p>Recall that we wish are given a problem out of the class of <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/FnFsLRj4Qybii22ae/uml-v-convex-learning-problems"">convex smooth bounded</a> problems (with parameters <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\beta, M""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.446em; padding-right: 0.007em;"">&#x3B2;</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""margin-top: -0.144em; padding-bottom: 0.519em;"">,</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi MJXc-space1""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.081em;"">M</span></span></span></span></span></span>), and we run the algorithm <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""A_{\text{SGD}}""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">A</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.23em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-texatom"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mtext""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">SGD</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> defined earlier in this post on our training sequence, <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""S""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.032em;"">S</span></span></span></span></span></span>.

But it&apos;s good enough. Through algebraic manipulations (adding the error of the optimal predictor on both sides and rescaling), we obtain a bound on the error of our output predictor, in terms of the error of the optimal predictor and the norm of the optimal predictor, i.e.:</p><span><figure><img src=""https://s19.directupload.net/images/200110/xnjtggla.jpg"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:51%""></figure></span><p>And the equation corresponding to this picture will be the theorem statement.</p><p>Now we just have to do the three steps, and then the algebraic stuff at the end.</p><h2>Step 1</h2><p>We start by bounding the term <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\sum_{t = 0}^{T-1} [\ell_{(\mathbf{x_t}, y_t)}(a^{(t)}) - \ell(a^*)]""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-munderover""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-size1-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em;

We created short, structured arguments for claims about movie  reviews. We then tried to distinguish valid from invalid arguments by  showing each participant only one step of the argument, not the review  or the other steps.</blockquote><blockquote>In this experiment, we found that:</blockquote><blockquote>1.  Factored  evaluation of arguments can distinguish some valid from invalid  arguments by identifying implausible steps in arguments for false  claims.</blockquote><blockquote>2.  However, experiment participants disagreed a lot about whether steps were valid or invalid. This method is therefore brittle in  its current form, even for arguments which only have 1&#x2013;5 steps.</blockquote><blockquote>3.  More diverse argument and evidence types (besides direct quotes from the  text), larger trees, and different participant guidelines should improve  results.</blockquote><blockquote>In this technical progress update, we describe these findings in depth.</blockquote><p>The rest of the post is <a href=""https://ought.org/updates/2020-01-11-arguments"">here</a>.</p><br><br>",Owain_Evans,owain_evans,Owain_Evans,

By doing so, I argued that we should instead appeal to the more general concept of <em>malign generalization</em>, and treat mesa-misalignment as a special case. </p><p>Unfortunately, the post was light on examples of what we should be worrying about instead of mesa-misalignment. Evan Hubinger wrote,</p><blockquote>Personally, I think there is a meaningful sense in which all the models I&apos;m most worried about do some sort of search internally (at least to the same extent that humans do search internally), but I&apos;m definitely uncertain about that.</blockquote><p>Wei Dai expressed confusion why I would want to retreat to malign generalization without some sort of concrete failure mode in mind,</p><blockquote>Can you give some realistic examples/scenarios of &#x201C;malign generalization&#x201D; that does not involve mesa optimization? I&#x2019;m not sure what kind of thing you&#x2019;re actually worried about here.</blockquote><p>In this post, I will outline a general category of agents which may exhibit malign generalization without internal search, and then will provide a concrete example of an agent in the category. Then I will argue that, rather than being a very narrow counterexample, this class of agents could be competitive with search-based agents. </p><h2><strong>The switch case agent</strong></h2><p>Consider an agent governed by the following general behavior, </p><p><span><style>.mjx-chtml {display: inline-block; line-height: 0; text-indent: 0; text-align: left; text-transform: none; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 100%; font-size-adjust: none; letter-spacing: normal; word-wrap: normal; word-spacing: normal; white-space: nowrap; float: none; direction: ltr; max-width: none; max-height: none; min-width: 0; min-height: 0; border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 1px 0}

Assume that some crater is painted red but our landing pads is painted blue. Now, the agent will guide itself competently towards the crater and miss the real landing pad entirely. That&apos;s not what we wanted.</p><p>(ETA: If you think I&apos;m using the term &apos;catastrophically&apos; too loosely here, since the agent actually lands safely in a crater rather than crashing into the ground, we could instead imagine a lunar vehicle which veers off into the red crater rather than just sitting still and awaiting further instruction since it&apos;s confused.)</p><h2><strong>What made the agent become malign</strong></h2><p>Above, I pointed to the reason why agents like ours could be malign. Specifically, it was &apos;mistaken&apos; about what counted as a landing pad. However, it&apos;s worth noting that saying the agent is mistaken about the state of the world is really an anthropomorphization. It was actually perfectly correct in inferring where the red part of the world was -- we just didn&apos;t want it to go to that part of the world. We model the agent as being &apos;mistaken&apos; about where the landing pad is, but it works equally well to model the agent as having goals that are counter to ours.</p><p>Since the malign failure doesn&apos;t come from a pure epistemic error, we can&apos;t merely expect that the agent will self-correct as it gains more knowledge about the world. Saying that it is making an epistemic mistake is just a model of what&apos;s going on that helps us interpret its behavior, and it does not imply that this error is benign.</p><h2><strong>Imagining more complex agents</strong></h2><p>But what&apos;s to worry about if this sort of thing only happens in very simple agents? Perhaps you think that only agents which perform internal search could ever reach the level of competence required to perform a real-world catastrophe?</p><p>I think that these concerns about my example are valid, but I don&apos;t believe they are compelling. As a reply, I think the general agent superstructure I outlined in the initial pseudocode could reach very high levels of competence.</p><p>Consider an agent that could, during its operation, call upon a vast array of subroutines. Some of these subroutines can accomplish extremely complicated actions, such as &quot;Prove this theorem: [...]&quot; or &quot;Compute the fastest route to Paris.&quot; We then imagine that this agent still shares the basic superstructure of the pseudocode I gave initially above. In effect, the agent has an outer loop, during which it takes in observations from the real world, and outputs action sequences depending on which state of the world it thinks its in, and using the subroutines it has available.</p><p>Since the subroutines are arbitrarily complex, I don&apos;t think there is any fundamental barrier for this agent to achieve high levels of competence in the real world. Moreover, some subroutines could themselves perform powerful internal searches, pretty clearly obviating the competitive advantage that explicit search agents offer.</p><p>And even while some subroutines could perform powerful internal searches, these subroutines aren&apos;t the only source of our malign generalization concern. The behavior of the agent is still well-described as a switch-case agent, and this means that the failure mode of the agent being &apos;mistaken&apos; about the state of the world remains. Therefore, it&apos;s inaccurate to say that the source of malign generalization <em>must</em> come from an internal search being misaligned with the objective function we used during training.</p>",matthew-barnett,matthew-barnett,Matthew Barnett,

Working for them puts tremendous pressure on you to prioritize getting ahead in the organization over everything else. Middle managers are particularly affected – they are pushed to sacrifice not only all of their time, but also things such as their morality, family and ability to think clearly. Only <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2019/12/29/perfect-competition/"">those who go all-in doing this</a>&nbsp;get ahead, and even most of them fail.</p><p>Even successfully getting ahead <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2020/01/10/what-is-success-in-an-immoral-maze/"">is little consolation</a>.</p><p>Mazes exert similar pressures on those who do business with them or work in non-managerial roles, to a lesser but substantial degree.</p><p>The best defense is to identify mazes before you agree to work for or do business with them, and choose to work or do business elsewhere. At a minimum, one’s eyes should be open, and the costs involved must be fully factored in before making such decisions.</p><p>This makes it important to figure out what parts of what organizations are mazes, and to what extent. This is hard to get exactly right.</p><p>What is easier is using simple heuristics to get a good approximation, then keeping an eye out for and updating on new evidence.</p><p>I offer seven heuristics, the first two of which will do the bulk of the work on their own. You benefit from the ‘right’ answer to all of them even absent concerns about mazes, so they are good questions to get into the habit of asking.</p><h2>1. How many levels of hierarchy exist?</h2><p>Full mazes require <i>at least </i>three levels of hierarchy, without which one cannot have middle management.</p><p>Each level beyond that makes things worse. The fourth and fifth levels both make things much worse.</p><p>With only one level, there’s nothing to worry about.</p><p>With only two levels, a boss and those who report to the boss, the boss has skin in the game, no boss causing problems for them, and not enough reason to reward bad outcomes.</p><p>With three levels, there are middle managers in the second layer, so one should be wary. But things are unlikely to be too bad. No middle manager has a boss or underling who is <i>also </i>a middle manager. This means that in any interaction between non-equals either involves the head of the company, or it involves someone ‘on the line’ who doesn’t have anyone reporting to them, and must deal with object-level reality. Either of them has reason to keep things grounded. Since there is only one person at the top, every conversation includes someone who interacts regularly with object level reality.</p><p>With four levels, we start to have interactions between middle managers in charge of each other. These dynamics start to get serious, but everyone still interacts with someone on the top or bottom.</p><p>At five levels, we have people who never interact directly with <i>either </i>the boss <i>or </i>anyone dealing with the object level.</p><p>At six levels, those people interact with each other.</p><p>And so on.</p><p>Meanwhile, the boss has less and less need or ability to comprehend the object level, and we get more and more problems with lack of skin in the game, which is question two.</p><p>At least one of the corporations in <i>Moral Mazes </i>had more than <i>twenty </i>ranks. That is <i>way, way </i>too many. By that point, it would be surprising if you weren’t doomed. I have <i>actual no idea&nbsp;</i>how to have twenty ranks and keep things sane.</p><p>Note that those outside the company, such as investors or regulators, seem like they should effectively count as a level under some circumstances, but not under others.</p><p>As a spot check, I looked back on the jobs I’ve had. This matches my experience.</p><p>Most impressive is that I can observe what happened when several of those jobs <i>added new layers of hierarchy.</i> This led <i>in every case </i>to traceable ways to additional maze-like behavior. In every case, that made life much worse for me and other employees, and hurt our productivity. In one case I was running the company at the time, and it still happened.&nbsp;</p><p>I would be very wary of any organization that had four levels of hierarchy. I would be progressively more skeptical of any organization with more than that, to the point of assuming it was a maze until proven otherwise.</p><h2>2. Do people have<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_in_the_game_(phrase)""> skin in the game</a>?</h2><p>Skin in the game is a robust defense against mazes, if it can be distributed widely enough and in the right ways. That can be tough. There’s only 100% total equity to go around.</p><p>One can only reward what can be observed or often only what can be quantified and measured.<a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/EbFABnst8LsidYs5Y/goodhart-taxonomy""> Something about Goodhart’s Law</a>, and so on. The problem with levels of hierarchy and middle management is in large part a problem of inability to provide skin in the game.</p><p>For sufficiently large organizations, as described in <i>Moral Mazes, </i>skin in the game is not so much spread thin as deliberately destroyed. The successful keep enough momentum to run away from the consequences of their problems. This alone is fatal.&nbsp;</p><p>If an organization has solved these problems for real, it likely isn’t a maze.&nbsp;</p><p>If an organization lacks skin in the game and also has many levels of hierarchy, you’re almost certainly dealing with a maze.&nbsp;</p><p>If it lacks skin in the game but also lacks levels of hierarchy, maze levels can differ. But also keep in mind that lack of skin in the game causes a whole host of problems. Only some of those are the problems of mazes. Detailing these issues is beyond the scope here, but be highly skeptical whenever skin in the game is lacking.</p><h2>3. Do people have soul in the game?</h2><p>What’s better than having skin in the game? Having soul in the game. Caring deeply about the outcome for reasons other than money, or your own liability, or being potentially scapegoated. Caring for existential reasons, not commercial ones.</p><p>Soul in the game is incompatible with mazes. Mazes will eliminate anyone with soul in the game. Therefore, if the people you work for have soul in the game, you’re safe. If you have it too, you’ll be a lot happier, and likely doing something worthwhile. Things will be much better on most fronts.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s worth prioritizing soul in the game, above and beyond skin in the game.</p><h2>4. How do people describe their job when you ask?</h2><p>Remember this quote:</p><blockquote><p><i>When managers describe their work to an outsider, they almost always first say: “I work for [Bill James]” or “I report to [Harry Mills]” or “I’m in [Joe Bell’s] group,”* and only then proceed to describe their actual work functions. (Location 387, Quote 2)</i></p></blockquote><p>You want them to say <i>almost anything else</i>. Anything that does not make you recoil in horror a different way. Hopefully something worthwhile and interesting. I don’t know how good this rule is, but I suspect it’s quite powerful.</p><p>5. Is there diversity of skill levels? Is excellence possible and rewarded?</p><p>The belief that all middle managers have the same skills, and are all equally capable of doing any managerial job aside from the politics involved, is a lot of what makes mazes so bad. If there is no <i>good </i>reason to diverge from standard practice, if everybody knows that you <i>cannot do better, </i>then any divergence is blameworthy, and shows you are not doing your job. There’s no need to ask why, or what advantages it might have.&nbsp;</p><p>It also all but ensures the wrong answer to the next question.</p><h2>6. Is there <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/09/30/slack/"">slack</a>?</h2><p>A world without slack is not a place one wants to be. Mazes systematically erase all slack. Slack is evidence of not being fully committed, and given that everyone’s skills are equal and competition is perfect, holding anything back means losing even if undetected.</p><h2>7. Pay Attention</h2><p>Sounds silly, but it works. Observe people and what they do and how they do it. If you work in a maze for long enough, you’re not going to shout it from the rooftops, but every sentence you speak will reflect it.</p><p>And as always, when people tell you who they are, believe them.</p><h2>Other Notes</h2><p>These questions do not differentiate between corporations, non-profits, governments, parties, clubs or other organizational forms. That’s not a good indicator. Corporations are only the original observed case.</p><p>Asking how proposed or expected changes will change the answers to these questions is a good way to know if those changes will raise the maze level of an organization.&nbsp;</p><p>Like most puzzles, there are multiple solutions, and the pieces reinforce each other. Most of the time, hardcore mazes will give alarm-bell level answers to all seven heuristics.&nbsp;</p><p>Are there any other good simple heuristics?&nbsp;</p><p>Next is How to Work With Moral Mazes, providing my best advice in detail to those dealing with the threat of mazes on a personal level.</p></body></html>",Zvi,zvi,Zvi,

We need a way of keeping  up with the constant barrage of decisions, even when the inevitable  &#x2018;decision fatigue&#x2019; sets in. The only way to do this, I find, is to act  on instinct, but this only works if your instincts are correct. They  cannot be correct all the time, of course, but if we can maximise the chance of making the right decision by instinct, then we have a strategy  for coping with a complicated and highly productive life.</blockquote><blockquote>To sharpen my instincts, I keep a monthly journal of all key decisions which I make &#x2013; decisions that could be truly life changing &#x2013;  and my instinctive reasons for why I made them. I go back only after exactly a year has passed, and I note down whether the decision was  correct, and more importantly whether my instincts were right. At the  end of the year, I go over all twelve months worth of notes, and search  for any patterns amongst all of the right and wrong choices. </blockquote><blockquote>This is not a short-term strategy, as you can tell. In fact it takes exactly two years from the day you start following it, to the time that  you can get some useful insights to sharpen your instincts. Keeping a diary of decisions has other uses, and there are many ways of getting an overview of your life prior to this, but it is only after the two years  have passed that a genuine clear pattern presents itself.</blockquote><p><strong>Some theory</strong></p><p>This accords with some abstract theory about human rationality. A  perfect-Bayesian expected utility maximizer doesn&apos;t start out with an optimal policy. Rather, its strength is being able to <em>learn</em> from its experience (optimally), so that it converges towards the optimal policy. </p><p>Of course, humans have a number of limitations standing between us and perfect-decision-making-in-the-limit. Due to computational constraints, perfect Bayesian updating is out of reach. But among a number of limitations, the first and most fundamental consideration is &quot;are you learning from your data at all?&quot;. </p><p>If the consequences of your decisions don&apos;t propagate back to the process(es) that you use to makes decisions, then that decision process isn&apos;t going to improve. </p><p>And I think that, by default, I mostly don&apos;t learn from my own experience, for a couple of reasons.</p><ul><li>Reflection isn&apos;t automatic, I&apos;m likely to make many decisions, important and unimportant, without every going back to check how they turned out, especially on long timescales.</li><li>With <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/fkM9XsNvXdYH6PPAx/hindsight-bias"">hindsight bias</a> and whatnot, I can&apos;t trust myself to remember <em>why</em> I made a decision, and how I was thinking about it at the time, after I&apos;ve seen how it turned out.</li><li> In general, each situation is treated as an isolated incident, instead examining at the level of my heuristics (i.e. the level of my decision making apparatus).</li></ul><p>So I need <em>some</em> process, that involves writing things down, that allows me to intentionally implement back-propagation.</p><p><strong>Personal experience</strong></p><p>I only started logging my decisions a little more than year ago, and did the analysis for the end of 2018 this week, so I don&apos;t have that much personal experience to share.

<p>The author's friend had created a new custom keyboard kit. Their friend's previous kit had sold out in minutes, so clearly something was amiss with their ""estimate costs and premiums and then set a price"" approach:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m not a fan of this inside-out approach, for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>factors like “brand premium” are inherently subjective — the temptation to compare to others limits potential upside and differentiation</li>
<li>picking a (new, higher) price may have reputational downsides (because o_f course_ your customers spend all day in mechanical keyboard chat rooms and may gripe about you “selling out the community”)</li>
<li>you will second guess yourself regardless of the outcome; either you sell out again (goto 0) or you sell too few and then must live with the shame of having $20k worth of unsold keyboard in your garage</li>
</ul>
<p>The most compelling argument against simply picking a price, though, is that it <em>limits how much you can learn about your market</em>.</p>

<p>Instead, they run a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vickrey_auction"">Vickrey auction</a> (or ""second-price sealed-bid auction"") and find that the demand curve supports 3x the list price they would have chosen:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I can’t overstate the benefits of knowing the demand curve.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In my friend’s case, the auction let them sell far above their initial price <em>and</em> revealed that the market was deep enough to justify a larger production run.</p>

<p>Few could honestly say that they are fully certain about the answers to these pressing moral questions. Part of the reason we feel less than fully certain about the answers has to do with uncertainty about <strong>empirical</strong> facts. We are uncertain about whether fish can feel pain, whether we can really help strangers far away, or what we could do for people in the far future. However, sometimes, the uncertainty is fundamentally <strong>moral</strong>. [...] Even if were to come to know all the relevant non‐normative facts, we could still waver about whether it is right to kill an animal for a very small benefit for a human, whether we have strong duties to help strangers in need, and whether future people matter as much as current ones. Fundamental moral uncertainty can also be more general as when we are uncertain about whether a certain moral theory is correct.

<p>I consider the above quote a great starting point for understanding what <a href=""https://concepts.effectivealtruism.org/concepts/moral-uncertainty/"">moral uncertainty</a> is; it gives clear examples of moral uncertainties, and contrasts these with related empirical uncertainties. From what I’ve seen, a lot of academic work on moral uncertainty essentially opens with something like the above, then notes that the rational approach to decision-making under <em>empirical</em> uncertainty is typically considered to be <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_utility_hypothesis"">expected utility theory</a>, then discusses various approaches for decision-making under <em>moral</em> uncertainty.</p>
<p>That’s fair enough, as no one article can cover everything, but it also leaves open some major questions about <strong>what moral uncertainty actually <em>is</em></strong>.<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-FjXofc6Ppsfjfjgky-2"" id=""fnref-FjXofc6Ppsfjfjgky-2"">[2]</a></sup> These include:</p>

<li>
<p>What are the overlaps and distinctions between moral uncertainty and other related concepts, such as <em>normative</em>, <em>metanormative</em>, <em>decision-theoretic</em>, and <em>metaethical</em> <em>uncertainty</em>, as well as <em>value pluralism</em>?</p>

<li><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/dXT5G9xEAddac8H2J/morality-vs-related-concepts"">My prior post</a> answers similar questions about how <em>morality</em> overlaps with and differs from related concepts, and may be worth reading before this one.</li>

<p>In this post, I collect and summarise ideas from academic philosophy and the LessWrong and EA communities in an attempt to answer the first two of the above questions (or to at least clarify what the questions <em>mean</em>, and what the <em>most plausible</em> answers are). My next few posts will do the same for the remaining questions.</p>
<p>I hope this will <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/64FdKLwmea8MCLWkE/the-neglected-virtue-of-scholarship"">benefit readers</a> by facilitating clearer thinking and discussion. For example, a better understanding of the nature and types of moral uncertainty may aid in determining how to <em>resolve</em> (i.e., reduce or clarify) one’s uncertainty, which I’ll discuss two posts from now. (How to make decisions <em>given</em> moral uncertainty is <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/dX7vNKg4vex5vxWCW/making-decisions-under-moral-uncertainty-1"">discussed later in this sequence</a>.)</p>
<p><em>Epistemic status: The concepts covered here are broad, fuzzy, and overlap in various ways, making definitions and distinctions between them almost inevitably debatable. Additionally, I’m not an expert in these topics (though I have now spent a couple weeks mostly reading about them). I’ve tried to mostly collect, summarise, and synthesise <strong>existing</strong> ideas. I’d appreciate feedback or comments in relation to any mistakes, unclear phrasings, etc. (and just in general!).</em></p>
<h1>Empirical uncertainty</h1>
<p>In the quote at the start of this post, Bykvist (the author) seemed to imply that it was easy to identify which uncertainties in that example were empirical and which were moral. However, in many cases, the lines aren’t so clear. This is perhaps most obvious with regards to, as <a href=""https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1c29/5c1c2e8eda8eb41560feb9f927104a6a6a85.pdf"">Christian Tarsney</a> puts it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Certain cases of uncertainty about moral considerability (or moral status more generally) [which] turn on <em>metaphysical</em> uncertainties that resist easy classification as empirical or moral.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[For example,] In the abortion debate, uncertainty about when in the course of development the fetus/infant comes to count as a <em>person</em> is neither straightforwardly empirical nor straightforwardly moral. Likewise for uncertainty in Catholic moral theology about the time of ensoulment, the moment between conception and birth at which God endows the fetus with a human soul [...]. Nevertheless, it seems strange to regard these uncertainties as fundamentally different from more clearly empirical uncertainties about the moral status of the developing fetus (e.g., uncertainty about where in the gestation process complex mental activity, self-awareness, or the capacity to experience pain first emerge), or from more clearly moral uncertainties (e.g., uncertainty, given a certainty that the fetus is a person, whether it is permissible to cause the death of such a person when doing so will result in more total happiness and less total suffering).<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-FjXofc6Ppsfjfjgky-4"" id=""fnref-FjXofc6Ppsfjfjgky-4"">[4]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And there are also other types of cases in which <strong>it seems hard to find clear, non-arbitrary lines between moral and empirical uncertainties</strong> (some of which Tarsney [p. 140-146] also discusses).<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-FjXofc6Ppsfjfjgky-5"" id=""fnref-FjXofc6Ppsfjfjgky-5"">[5]</a></sup> Altogether, I expect drawing such lines will quite often be difficult.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we may not actually <em>need</em> to draw such lines anyway. In fact, as I discuss in <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/eYiDjCNJrR3w3WcMM/what-to-do-when-both-morally-and-empirically-uncertain"">my post on <em>making decisions</em> under both moral and empirical uncertainty</a>, many approaches for handling moral uncertainty were consciously designed by analogy to approaches for handling empirical uncertainty, and it seems to me that they can easily be extended to handle both moral and empirical uncertainty, without having to distinguish between those “types” of uncertainty.<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-FjXofc6Ppsfjfjgky-6"" id=""fnref-FjXofc6Ppsfjfjgky-6"">[6]</a></sup><sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-FjXofc6Ppsfjfjgky-7"" id=""fnref-FjXofc6Ppsfjfjgky-7"">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>The situation is a little less clear when it comes to <em>resolving</em> one’s uncertainty (rather than just making decisions <em>given</em> uncertainty). It seems at first glance that you might need to investigate different “types” of uncertainty in different ways. For example, if I’m uncertain whether fish react to pain in a certain way, I might need to read studies about that, whereas if I’m uncertain what “moral status” fish deserve (even assuming that I know all the relevant empirical facts), then I might need to engage in moral reflection. However, it seems to me that the key difference in such examples is <em>what the uncertainties are actually <strong>about</strong></em>, rather than specifically whether <em>a given uncertainty</em> should be classified as “moral” or “empirical”.</p>
<p>(It’s also worth quickly noting that the topic of “<a href=""https://philpapers.org/rec/GREC-38"">cluelessness</a>” is only about <em>empirical</em> uncertainty - specifically, uncertainty regarding the consequences that one’s actions will have. Cluelessness thus won’t be addressed in my posts on moral uncertainty, although I do plan to later write about it separately.)</p>
<h1>Normative uncertainty</h1>
<p>As I noted in <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/dXT5G9xEAddac8H2J/morality-vs-related-concepts"">my prior post</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A <em>normative</em> statement is any statement related to what one <em>should</em> do, what one <em>ought</em> to do, which of two things are <em>better</em>, or similar. [...] Normativity is thus the overarching category (<em><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset"">superset</a></em>) of which things like morality, prudence [essentially meaning the part of normativity that has to do with one’s own self-interest, happiness, or wellbeing], and arguably rationality are just subsets.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the same way, <strong><em>normative uncertainty</em> is a broader concept, of which <em>moral uncertainty</em> is just one component</strong>. Other components could include:</p>
<ul>
<li>prudential uncertainty</li>
<li>decision-theoretic uncertainty (covered below)</li>
<li>metaethical uncertainty (also covered below) - although perhaps it’d make more sense to see metaethical uncertainty as instead just feeding into one’s moral uncertainty</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite this, academic sources seem to commonly either:</p>
<ul>
<li>focus only on moral uncertainty, or</li>
<li>state or imply that essentially the same approaches for decision-making will work for both moral uncertainty in particular and normative uncertainty in general (which seems to me a fairly reasonable assumption).</li>
</ul>
<p>On this matter, <a href=""https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1c29/5c1c2e8eda8eb41560feb9f927104a6a6a85.pdf"">Tarsney</a> writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fundamentally, the topic of the coming chapters will be the problem of <em>normative</em> uncertainty, which can be roughly characterized as uncertainty about one’s objective reasons that is not a result of some underlying empirical uncertainty (uncertainty about the state of concretia). However, I will confine myself almost exclusively to questions about <em>moral</em> uncertainty: uncertainty about one’s objective <em>moral</em> reasons that is not a result of etc etc. This is in part merely a matter of vocabulary: “moral uncertainty” is a bit less cumbersome than “normative uncertainty,” a consideration that bears some weight when the chosen expression must occur dozens of times per chapter. It is also in part because the vast majority of the literature on normative uncertainty deals specifically with moral uncertainty, and because moral uncertainty provides more than enough difficult problems and interesting examples, so that there is no need to venture outside the moral domain.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Additionally, however, focusing on moral uncertainty is a useful simplification that allows us to avoid difficult questions about the relationship between moral and non-moral reasons (though I am hopeful that the theoretical framework I develop can be applied straightforwardly to normative uncertainties of a non-moral kind). For myself, I have no taste for the moral/non-moral distinction: To put it as crudely and polemically as possible, it seems to me that all objective reasons are moral reasons. But this view depends on substantive normative ethical commitments that it is well beyond the scope of this dissertation to defend. [...]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If one does think that all reasons are moral reasons, or that moral reasons always override non-moral reasons, then a complete account of how agents ought to act under moral uncertainty can be given without any discussion of non-moral reasons (Lockhart, 2000, p. 16). To the extent that one does not share either of these assumptions, theories of choice under moral uncertainty must generally be qualified with “insofar as there are no relevant non-moral considerations.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Somewhat similarly, this sequence will nominally focus on moral uncertainty, even though:</p>
<ul>
<li>some of the work I’m drawing on was nominally focused on normative uncertainty (e.g., <a href=""http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/MacAskill-Normative-Uncertainty.pdf"">Will MacAskill’s thesis</a>)</li>
<li>I intend most of what I say to be fairly easily generalisable to normative uncertainty more broadly.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Metanormative uncertainty</h1>
<p>In <a href=""http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/MacAskill-Normative-Uncertainty.pdf"">MacAskill’s thesis</a>, he writes that <em>metanormativism</em> is “the view that there are second-order norms that govern action that are relative to a decision-maker’s uncertainty about first-order normative claims. [...] The central metanormative question is [...] about which <em>option</em> it’s appropriate to choose [when a decision-maker is uncertain about which first-order normative theory to believe in]”. MacAskill goes on to write:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A note on terminology: Metanormativism isn’t <em>about</em> normativity, in the way that meta-ethics is about ethics, or that a meta-language is about a language. Rather, ‘meta’ is used in the sense of ‘over’ or ‘beyond’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In essence, <strong><em>metanormativism</em> focuses on what metanormative theories (or “approaches”) should be used for making decisions under <em>normative uncertainty</em></strong>.</p>
<p>We can therefore imagine being <em>metanormatively uncertain</em>: uncertain about <em>what metanormative theories to use</em> for making decisions under normative uncertainty. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>You’re <em>normatively</em> uncertain if you see multiple (“first-order”) moral theories as possible and these give conflicting suggestions.</li>
<li>You’re _meta_normatively uncertain if you’re also unsure whether the best approach for deciding what to do given this uncertainty is the “My Favourite Theory” approach or the “Maximising Expected Choice-worthiness” approach (both of which are explained <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/dX7vNKg4vex5vxWCW/making-decisions-under-moral-uncertainty-1"">later in this sequence</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>This leads inevitably to the following thought:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It seems that, just as we can suffer [first-order] normative uncertainty, we can suffer [second-order] metanormative uncertainty as well: we can assign positive probability to conflicting [second-order] metanormative theories. [Third-order] Metametanormative theories, then, are collections of claims about how we ought to act in the face of [second-order] metanormative uncertainty. And so on. In the end, it seems that the very existence of normative claims—the very notion that there are, in some sense or another, ways “one ought to behave”—organically gives rise to an infinite hierarchy of metanormative uncertainty, with which an agent may have to contend in the course of making a decision.

<h1>Decision-theoretic uncertainty</h1>
<p><em>(Readers who are unfamiliar with the topic of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_decision_theory"">decision</a></em> <em><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidential_decision_theory"">theories</a> may wish to read up on that first, or to skip this section.)</em></p>
<p><a href=""http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/MacAskill-Normative-Uncertainty.pdf"">MacAskill</a> writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given the trenchant disagreement between intelligent and well-informed philosophers, it seems highly plausible that one should not be certain in either causal or evidential decision theory. In light of this fact, Robert Nozick briefly raised an interesting idea: that perhaps one should take decision-theoretic uncertainty into account in one’s decision-making.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is precisely analogous to taking uncertainty about first-order moral theories into account in decision-making. Thus, <strong><em>decision-theoretic uncertainty</em> is just another type of normative uncertainty</strong>. Furthermore, arguably, it can be handled using the same sorts of “metanormative theories” suggested for handling moral uncertainty (which are discussed <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/dX7vNKg4vex5vxWCW/making-decisions-under-moral-uncertainty-1"">later in this sequence</a>).</p>
<p>Chapter 6 of MacAskill’s thesis is dedicated to discussion of this matter, and I refer interested readers there. For example, he writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>metanormativism about decision theory [is] the idea that there is an important sense of ‘ought’ (though certainly not the only sense of ‘ought’) according which a decision-maker ought to take decision-theoretic uncertainty into account. I call any metanormative theory that takes decision-theoretic uncertainty into account a type of <em>meta decision theory</em> [- in] contrast to a metanormative view according to which there are norms that are relative to moral and prudential uncertainty, but not relative to decision-theoretic uncertainty.<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-FjXofc6Ppsfjfjgky-8"" id=""fnref-FjXofc6Ppsfjfjgky-8"">[8]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<h1>Metaethical uncertainty</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>While normative ethics addresses such questions as ""What should I do?"", evaluating specific practices and principles of action, meta-ethics addresses questions such as ""What is goodness?"" and ""How can we tell what <em>is</em> good from what is bad?"", seeking to understand the nature of ethical properties and evaluations. (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-ethics"">Wikipedia</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To illustrate, <em>normative</em> (or “first-order”) ethics involves debates such as “Consequentialist or deontological theories?”, while _meta_ethics involves debates such as “Moral realism or moral antirealism?” Thus, <strong>in just the same way we could be uncertain about first-order ethics (<em>morally uncertain</em>), we could be uncertain about metaethics (<em>metaethically uncertain</em>).</strong></p>
<p>It seems that metaethical uncertainty is rarely discussed; in particular, I’ve found no detailed treatment of <em>how to make decisions</em> under metaethical uncertainty. However, there is one brief comment on the matter in <a href=""http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/MacAskill-Normative-Uncertainty.pdf"">MacAskill’s thesis</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>even if one endorsed a meta-ethical view that is inconsistent with the idea that there’s value in gaining more moral information [e.g., certain types of moral antirealism], one should not be certain in that meta-ethical view. And it’s high-stakes whether that view is true — if there are moral facts out there but one thinks there aren’t, that’s a big deal! Even for this sort of antirealist, then, there’s therefore value in moral information, because there’s value in finding out for certain whether that meta-ethical view is correct.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It <em>seems to me</em> that, if and when we face metaethical uncertainties that are relevant to the question of what we should <em>actually do</em>, we could likely use basically the same approaches that are advised for decision-making under <em>moral</em> uncertainty (which I discuss <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/dX7vNKg4vex5vxWCW/making-decisions-under-moral-uncertainty-1"">later in this sequence</a>).<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-FjXofc6Ppsfjfjgky-9"" id=""fnref-FjXofc6Ppsfjfjgky-9"">[9]</a></sup></p>
<h1>Moral pluralism</h1>
<p>A different matter that could <em>appear</em> similar to moral uncertainty is <em>moral pluralism</em> (aka <em>value pluralism</em>, aka <em>pluralistic moral theories</em>). According to <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/value-pluralism/"">SEP</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>moral pluralism [is] the view that there are many different moral values.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Commonsensically we talk about lots of different values—happiness, liberty, friendship, and so on. The question about pluralism in moral theory is whether these apparently different values are all reducible to one supervalue, or whether we should think that there really are several distinct values.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href=""http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/MacAskill-Normative-Uncertainty.pdf"">MacAskill</a> notes that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Someone who [takes a particular expected-value-style approach to decision-making] under uncertainty about whether only wellbeing, or both knowledge and wellbeing, are of value looks a lot like someone who is conforming with a first-order moral theory that assigns both wellbeing and knowledge value.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In fact, one may even decide to react to moral uncertainty by just no longer having <em>any</em> degree of belief in each of the first-order moral theories they’re uncertain over, and <strong>instead having complete belief in a <em>new</em> (and <em>still first-order</em>) moral theory that <em>combines</em> those previously-believed theories</strong>.<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-FjXofc6Ppsfjfjgky-10"" id=""fnref-FjXofc6Ppsfjfjgky-10"">[10]</a></sup> For example, after discussing two approaches for thinking about the “moral weight” of different animals’ experiences, <a href=""https://reducing-suffering.org/two-envelopes-problem-for-brain-size-and-moral-uncertainty/#Other_examples_of_the_moral-uncertainty_two-envelopes_problem"">Brian Tomasik</a> writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Both of these approaches strike me as having merit, and not only am I not sure which one I would choose, but I might actually choose them both. In other words, more than merely having moral uncertainty between them, I might adopt a ""value pluralism"" approach and decide to care about both simultaneously, with some trade ratio between the two.<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-FjXofc6Ppsfjfjgky-11"" id=""fnref-FjXofc6Ppsfjfjgky-11"">[11]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But it’s important to note that <strong>this <em>really isn’t</em> the same as moral uncertainty</strong>; the difference is not merely verbal or merely a matter of framing. For example, if Alan has complete belief in a pluralistic combination of utilitarianism and Kantianism, rather than uncertainty over the two theories:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Alan has no need for a (second-order) metanormative theory for decision-making under moral uncertainty, because he no longer has any moral uncertainty.</p>
<ul>
<li>If instead Alan has less than complete belief in the pluralistic theory, then the moral uncertainty that remains is between <em>the pluralistic theory</em> and whatever other theories he has some belief in (rather than between <em>utilitarianism</em>, <em>Kantianism</em>, and whatever other theories the person has some belief in).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can’t represent the idea of Alan updating to believe more strongly in the Kantian theory, or to believe more strongly in the utilitarian theory.<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-FjXofc6Ppsfjfjgky-12"" id=""fnref-FjXofc6Ppsfjfjgky-12"">[12]</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Relatedly, we’re no longer able to straightforwardly apply the idea of <em>value of information</em> to things that may inform Alan degree of belief in each theory.<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-FjXofc6Ppsfjfjgky-13"" id=""fnref-FjXofc6Ppsfjfjgky-13"">[13]</a></sup></p>

<h1>Closing remarks</h1>
<p>I hope this post helped clarify the distinctions and overlaps between moral uncertainty and related concepts. (And as always, I’d welcome any feedback or comments!) In my next post, I’ll continue exploring what moral uncertainty actually <strong>is</strong>, this time focusing on the questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is what we “ought to do” under moral uncertainty an <em>objective</em> or <em>subjective</em> matter?</li>
<li>Is what we “ought to do” under moral uncertainty a matter of <em>rationality</em> or <em>morality</em>?</li>

<blockquote>
<p>The most popular method of investigation in contemporary analytic moral philosophy, the method of reflective equilibrium based on heavy appeal to intuitive judgments about cases, has come under concerted attack and is regarded by many philosophers (e.g. Singer (2005), Greene (2008)) as deeply suspect. Additionally, every major theoretical approach to moral philosophy (whether at the level of normative ethics or metaethics) is subject to important and intuitively compelling objections, and the resolution of these objections often turns on delicate and methodologically fraught questions in other areas of philosophy like the metaphysics of consciousness or personal identity (Moller, 2011, pp. 428- 432). Whatever position one takes on these debates, it can hardly be denied that our understanding of morality remains on a much less sound footing than, say, our knowledge of the natural sciences. If, then, we remain deeply and justifiably uncertain about a litany of important questions in physics, astronomy, and biology, we should certainly be at least equally uncertain about moral matters, even when some particular moral judgment is widely shared and stable upon reflection.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most generally, naturalistic metaethical views that treat normative ethical theorizing as continuous with natural science will see first-order moral principles as at least epistemically if not metaphysically dependent on features of the empirical world. For instance, on Railton’s (1986) view, moral value attaches (roughly) to social conditions that are stable with respect to certain kinds of feedback mechanisms (like the protest of those who object to their treatment under existing social conditions). What sort(s) of social conditions exhibit this stability, given the relevant background facts about human psychology, is an empirical question. For instance, is a social arrangement in which parents can pass down large advantages to their offspring through inheritance, education, etc, more stable or less stable than one in which the state intervenes extensively to prevent such intergenerational perpetuation of advantage? Someone who accepts a Railtonian metaethic and is therefore uncertain about the first-order normative principles that govern such problems of distributive justice, though on essentially empirical grounds, seems to occupy another sort of liminal space between empirical and moral uncertainty.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For instance, consider an agent Alex who, like Alice, divides his moral belief between two theories, a hedonistic and a pluralistic version of consequentialism. But suppose that Alex also divides his <em>metaethical</em> beliefs between a robust moral realism and a fairly anemic anti-realism, and that his credence in hedonistic consequentialism is mostly or entirely conditioned on his credence in robust realism while his credence in pluralism is mostly or entirely conditioned on his credence in anti-realism. (Suppose he inclines toward a hedonistic view on which certain qualia have intrinsic value or disvalue entirely independent of our beliefs, attitudes, etc, which we are morally required to maximize. But if this view turns out to be wrong, he believes, then morality can only consist in the pursuit of whatever we contingently happen to value in some distinctively moral way, which includes pleasure but also knowledge, aesthetic goods, friendship, etc.)</p>

Alice&apos;s odd&apos;s of E are 55% and Bob&apos;s are 90%. It becomes clear to them that they have different odds, and being good (and competitive) rationalists they decide to make a bet. </p><p>Essentially, bet construction can be seen as a bargaining problem, with the gap in odds as surplus value. Alice has positive EV on the &quot;No&quot; position for bets at &gt;55% odds. Bob has neutral or better EV on the &quot;Yes&quot; position for bets at &lt;90% odds. </p><p>Naive bet construction strategy: bet with 50/50 odds. Negative EV for Alice, so this bet doesn&apos;t work.</p><p>Less naive bet construction strategy: Alice and Bob negotiate over odds. The problem here, in my eyes, is that Alice and Bob have an incentive to strategically misrepresent their private odds of E in order to negotiate a better bet. If Alice is honest that her odds are 50%, and Bob lies that his odds are 70%, so they split the difference at 60%, Bob takes most of the surplus value. </p><p>If both were honest and bargaining equitably, they&apos;d have split the difference at 72.5% instead. So I&apos;ll call 72.5% the &quot;fair&quot; odds for this bet.</p><p>A nicer and more rationalist aligned bet construction strategy wouldn&apos;t reward dishonesty! So, here it is.</p><p>1. Alice and Bob submit their maximum bets and their odds.</p><p>2. Take the minimum of the two maximum bets. Let&apos;s say its $198. </p><p>3. Construct 99 mini bets*; one at 1% odds of E, 2% odds of E... 99% odds of E. Each player automatically places 2$ on each mini bet that is favorable according to their odds ($198/99 = $2). </p><p>*99 chosen for simplicity. You could choose a much higher number for the sake of granularity.</p><p>So, in this case, Alice accepts the No position on all bets at =&gt;55% odds, and Bob accepts the Yes position on all bets at =&lt;90% odds, so they make 35 $2 bets, the average odds of which are 72.5%, which is the fair odds.</p><p>Observe that there is no incentive for either player to have misrepresented their odds. If Alice overrepresented her odds as 60%, she would just deny herself the ability to bet on bets at 56% through 59%, which have positive EV for her. </p><p>Note that Alice and Bob only bet $70 -- less than half of the maximum bet. If Bob wanted Alice to bet more money than she was really willing to risk, he might try to convince her that his odds were close to hers, such that a high maximum bet would still lead to a low actual bet. Does this seem like a problem to you? I think this method is still an improvement.</p><p>*The mini bets can be abbreviated analytically as one bet at average odds, I just like the mini bets concept for making the intuition clear. </p><p>-- </p><p>I am not sure how exciting this method is to anyone. I like it because misrepresentation of value is a core problem in 2 player bargaining, and I realized betting is a bit of a special case. Other special cases exist too-- anything where players would be willing to accept uncertainty over the size of the trade (and are trading a continuous good such that that&apos;s even possible).</p>",asktree,asktree,Agrippa Kellum,

Perhaps Alice wants to convince Judy that raising the minimum wage is a cost-effective way to fight poverty, and Bob wants to convince Judy that it&nbsp;isn’t.</p><p>If Judy has the same background knowledge as Alice and Bob, and is willing to spend as much time thinking about the issue as they have, then she can hear all of their arguments and decide for herself whom she believes.</p><p>But in many cases Judy will have much less time than Alice or Bob, and is missing a lot of relevant background knowledge. Often Judy can’t even understand the key considerations in the argument; how can she hope to arbitrate it?</p><p>Wagers</p><p>For a warm-up, imagine that Judy could evaluate the arguments if she spent a long enough thinking about&nbsp;them.</p><p>To save time, she could make Alice and Bob wager on the result. If both of them believe they’ll win the argument, then they should be happy to agree to the deal: “If I win the argument I get $100; if I lose I pay $100.” (Note: by the end of the post, no dollars will need to be involved.)</p><p>If either side isn’t willing to take the bet, then Judy could declare the case settled without wasting her time. If they are both willing to bet, then Judy can hear them out and decide who she agrees with. That person “wins” the argument, and the bet: <strong>Alice and Bob are betting about what Judy will believe, not about the facts on the&nbsp;ground</strong>.</p><p>Of course we don’t have to stick with 1:1 bets. Judy wants to know the probability that she will be convinced, and so wants to know at what odds the two parties are both willing to bet. Based on that probability, she can decide if she wants to hear the arguments.</p><p>It may be that both parties are happy to take 2:1 bets, i.e. each believes they have a 2/3 chance of being right. What should Judy believe? (In fact this should always happen at small stakes: both participants are willing to pay some premium to try to convince Judy. For example, no matter what Alice believes, she would probably be willing to take a bet of $0.10 against $0.01, if doing so would help her convince&nbsp;Judy.)</p><p>If this happens, there is an arbitrage opportunity: Judy can make 2:1 bets with both of them, and end up with a guaranteed profit. So we can continuously raise the required stakes for each wager, until either (1) the market approximately clears, i.e. the two are willing to bet at nearly the same odds, or (2) the arbitrage gap is large enough to compensate Judy for the time of hearing the argument. If (2) happens, then Judy implements the arbitrage and hears the arguments. (In this case Judy gets paid for her time, but the pay is independent of what she decides.)</p><p>Recursion</p><p>Betting about the whole claim saved us some time (at best). Betting about parts of the claim might get us much&nbsp;further.</p><p>In the course of arguing, Alice and Bob will probably rely on intermediate claims or summaries of particular evidence. For example, Alice might provide a short report describing what we should infer from study Z, or Bob might claim “The analysis in study Z is so problematic that we should ignore&nbsp;it.”</p><p>Let’s allow anyone to make a claim at any time. But if Alice makes a claim, Bob can make a counterclaim that he feels better represents the evidence. Then we have a recursive argument to decide which version better represents the evidence.</p><p>The key idea is that <strong>this recursive argument can also be settled by betting</strong>. So one of two things happens: (1) Judy is told the market-clearing odds, and can use that information to help settle the original argument, or (2) there is an arbitrage opportunity, so Judy hears out the argument and collects the profits to compensate her for the&nbsp;time.</p><p>This recursive argument is made in context: that is, Judy evaluates which of the two claims she feels would be a more helpful summary within the original argument. Sometimes this will be a question of fact about which Alice and Bob disagree, but sometimes it will be a more complicated judgment call. For example, we could even have a recursive argument about which wording better reflects the nuances of the situation.</p><p>When making this evaluation, Judy uses facts she learned over the course of the argument, but she interprets the claim as she would have interpreted it at the beginning of the argument. For example, if Bob asserts “The ellipsoid algorithm is efficient” and Alice disagrees, Bob cannot win the argument by explaining that “efficient” is a technical term which in context means “polynomial time”—unless that’s how Judy would have understood the statement to start&nbsp;with.</p><p>This allows Judy to arbitrate disagreements that are too complex for her to evaluate in their entirety, by showing her what she “would have believed” about a number of intermediate claims, if she had bothered to check. Each of these intermediate claims might itself be too complicated for Judy to evaluate directly—if Judy needed to evaluate it, she would use the same trick&nbsp;again.</p><p>Betting with attention</p><p>If Alice and Bob are betting about many claims over the course of a long argument, we can replace dollars by “attention points,” which represent Judy’s time thinking about the argument (perhaps 1 attention point = 1 minute of Judy’s time). Judy considers an arbitrage opportunity “good enough” if the profit is more than the time required to evaluate the argument. The initial allocation of attention points reflects the total amount of time Judy is willing to spend thinking about the issue. If someone runs out of attention points, then they can no longer make any claims or use up any of Judy’s&nbsp;time.</p><p>This removes some of the problems of using dollars, and introduces a new set of problems. The modified system works best when the total stock of attention points is large compared to the number at stake for each claim. Intuitively, if there are N comparable claims to wager about, the stakes of each should not be more than a 1/sqrt(N) of the total attention pool — or else random chance will be too large a factor. This requirement still allows a large gap between the time actually required to evaluate an argument (i.e. the initial bankroll of attention points) and the total time that would have been required to evaluate all of the claims made in the argument (the total stake of all of the bets). If each claim is itself supported by a recursive argument, this gap can grow exponentially.</p><p>Talking it&nbsp;out</p><p>If Alice and Bob disagree about a claim (rather, if they disagree about Judy’s probability of accepting the claim) then they can have an incentive to “talk it out” rather than bringing the dispute to&nbsp;Judy.</p><p>For example, suppose that Alice and Bob each think they have a 60% chance of winning an argument. If they bring in Judy to arbitrate, both of them will get unfavorable odds. Because the surplus from the disagreement is going to Judy, both parties would be happy enough to see their counterparty wise up (and of course both would be happy to wise up themselves). This creates room for positive sum&nbsp;trades.</p><p>Rather than bringing in Judy to arbitrate their disagreement, they could do further research, consult an expert, pay Judy attention points to hear her opinion on a key issue, talk to Judy’s friends—whatever is the most cost-effective way to resolve the disagreement. Once they have this information, their betting odds can reflect&nbsp;it.</p><p>An example</p><p>Suppose that Alice and Bob are arguing about how many trees are in North America; both are experts on the topic, but Judy knows nothing about&nbsp;it.</p><p>The easiest case is if Alice and Bob know all of the relevant facts, but one of them wants to mislead Judy. In this case, the truth will quickly prevail. Alice and Bob can begin by breaking down the issue into “How many trees are in each of Canada, the US, and Mexico?” If Alice or Bob lie about any of these estimates, they will quickly be corrected. Neither should be willing to bet much for a lie, but if they do, the same thing will happen recursively — the question will be broken down into “how many trees are east and west of the Mississippi?” and so on, until they disagree about how many trees are on a particular hill—a straightforward disagreement to&nbsp;resolve.</p><p>In reality, Alice and Bob will have different information about each of these estimates (and geography probably won’t be the easiest way to break things down — instead they might combine the different considerations that inform their views, the best guess suggested by different methodologies, approximate counts of each type of tree on each type of land, and so on). If Alice and Bob can reach a rational consensus on a given estimate, then Judy can use that consensus to inform her own view. If Alice and Bob can’t resolve their disagreement, then we’re back to the previous case. The only difference is that now Alice and Bob have probabilistic disagreements: if Alice disagrees with Bob she doesn’t expect to win the ensuing argument with 100% probability, merely with a high probability.</p><p>Odds and&nbsp;ends</p><p>This writeup leaves many details underspecified. In particular, how does Judy estimate how long it will take her to arbitrate a disagreement? This can be handled in several ways: by having Judy guess, by having Alice and Bob bet on the length of time until Judy reaches a conclusion, by having them make bets of the form “Alice will agree with me with Z effort,” or so on. I don’t know what would work&nbsp;best.</p><p>Despite my use of the word “recursion,” the estimate for “time to settle an argument” (which Judy uses to decide when the stakes are high enough to step in and resolve a disagreement) probably shouldn’t include the time required to settle sub-arguments, since Judy is being paid separately for arbitrating each of those. The structure of the arguments and sub-arguments need not be a&nbsp;tree.</p><p>This is a simple enough proposal that it can be realistically implemented, so eventually we’ll hopefully see how it works and why it&nbsp;fails.</p><p>I expect this will work best if Alice and Bob often argue about similar&nbsp;topics.</p><p>This scheme was motivated by a particular exotic application: delegating decision-making to very intelligent machines. In that setting the goal is to scale to very complex disagreements, with very intelligent arguers, while being very efficient with the overseer’s time (and more cavalier with the arguers’&nbsp;time).</p><figure><img src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=ee16a0e84cf7""></figure><hr><p><a href=""https://ai-alignment.com/of-arguments-and-wagers-ee16a0e84cf7"">Of arguments and wagers</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://ai-alignment.com"">AI Alignment</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p></body></html>",paulfchristiano,paulfchristiano,paulfchristiano,

See <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/73xBjgoHuiKvJ5WRk/intuitive-self-models-2-conscious-awareness"">[Intuitive self-models] 2. Conscious Awareness</a> for my own Rethinking-Consciousness-adjacent theorizing.)</em></p>
<p>Princeton neuroscientist Michael Graziano wrote the book <em>Rethinking Consciousness</em> (2019) to explain his ""Attention Schema"" theory of consciousness (endorsed by Dan Dennett!<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-MHQvk43GASmyRoykj-1"" id=""fnref-MHQvk43GASmyRoykj-1"">[1]</a></sup>). If you don't want to read the whole book, you can get the short version in <a href=""https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00500"">this 2015 article</a>.</p>
<p>I'm particularly interested in this topic because, if we build AGIs, we ought to figure out whether they are conscious, and/or whether that question matters morally. (As if we didn't already have our hands full thinking about the <em>human</em> impacts of AGI!) This book is nice and concrete and computational, and I think it at least offers a start to answering the first part of that question.</p>
<h1>What is attention schema theory?</h1>
<p>There are two ingredients.</p>
<p><strong>For the first ingredient,</strong> you should read <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/ZbmRyDN8TCpBTZSip/p/x4n4jcoDP7xh5LWLq"">Kaj Sotala's excellent review of <em>Consciousness and the Brain</em> by Stan Dehaene</a> (or read the actual book!) To summarize, there is a process in the brain whereby certain information gets promoted up to a <strong>""Global Neuronal Workspace"" (GNW)</strong>, a special richly-connected high-level subnetwork of the brain. Only information in the GNW can be remembered and described—i.e., this is the information of which we are ""aware"". For example, if something flashes in our field of view too quickly for us to ""notice"", it doesn't enter the GNW. So it does get processed to some extent, and can cause local brain activity that persists for a couple seconds, but will not cascade to a large, widespread signal with long-lasting effects.</p>
<p>Every second of every day, information is getting promoted to the GNW, and the GNW is processing it and pushing information into other parts of the brain. This process does not constitute all of cognition, but it's an important part. Graziano calls this process <strong>attention</strong>.<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-MHQvk43GASmyRoykj-2"" id=""fnref-MHQvk43GASmyRoykj-2"">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>The second ingredient is that the brain likes to build predictive models of things</strong>—Graziano calls them ""schemas"" or ""internal models"". If you know what an apple is, your brain has an ""apple model"", that describes apples' properties, behavior, affordances, etc. Likewise, we all have a ""body schema"", a deeply-rooted model that tracks where our body is, what it's doing, and how it works. If you have a phantom limb, that means your body schema has a limb where your actual body does not. As the phantom limb example illustrates, these schemas are deeply rooted, and not particularly subject to deliberate control.</p>
<p><strong>Now put the two together, and you get an ""attention schema"", an internal model of attention (i.e., of the activity of the GNW)</strong>. The attention schema is supposedly key to the mystery of consciousness.</p>
<p><strong>Why does the brain build an attention schema?</strong> Graziano offers two reasons, and I'll add a third.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First, it's important that we control attention (it being central to cognition), and control theory says it's impossible to properly control something unless you're modeling it. Graziano offers an example of trying to ignore a distraction. Experiments show that, other things equal, this is easier if we are aware of the distraction. That's counter-intuitive, and supports his claim.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second, the attention schema can also be used to model other people's attention, which is helpful for interacting with them, understanding them, deceiving them, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Third (I would add), the brain is a thing that by default builds internal models of everything it encounters. The workings of the GNW obviously has a giant impact on the signals going everywhere in the brain, so of course the brain is going to try to build a predictive model of it! I mention this partly because of <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/diruo47z32eprenTg/my-computational-framework-for-the-brain"">my blank-slate-ish sympathies</a>, but I think it's an important possibility to keep in mind, because it would mean that even if we <em>desperately want</em> to build a human-cognition-like AGI without an attention schema (if we want AGIs to be unconscious for ethical reasons; more on which below), it might be essentially impossible.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To be clear, if GNW is ""consciousness"" (as Dehaene describes it), then the attention schema is ""how we think about consciousness"". So this seems to be at the wrong level! This is a book about consciousness; shouldn't we be talking directly about the nature of consciousness itself?? I was confused about this for a while. But it turns out, he <em>wants</em> to be one level up! He thinks that's where the answers are, in the ""the meta-problem of consciousness"". See below.</p>
<h1>When people talk about consciousness, they're introspecting about their attention schema</h1>
<p>Let's go through some examples.</p>
<p><strong>Naive description:</strong> I have a consciousness, and I can be aware of things, like right now I'm aware of this apple.</p>
<p><strong>...and corresponding sophisticated description:</strong> One of my internal models is an attention schema. According to that schema, attention has a particular behavior wherein attention kinda ""takes possession"" of a different internal model, e.g. a model of a particular apple. Objectively, we would say that this happens when the apple model becomes active in the GNW.</p>
<p><strong>Naive description:</strong> My consciousness is not a physical thing with color, shape, texture. So it's sorta metaphysical, although I guess it's roughly located in my head.</p>
<p><strong>...and corresponding sophisticated description:</strong> Just as my internal model of ""multiplication"" has no property of ""saltiness"", by the same token, my attention schema describes attention as having no color, shape, or texture.</p>
<p><strong>Naive description:</strong> I have special access to my own consciousness. I alone can truly experience my experiences.</p>
<p><strong>...and corresponding sophisticated description:</strong> The real GNW does not directly interact with other people; it only interacts with the world by affecting my own actions. Reflecting that fact, my attention schema describes attention as a thing to which I have privileged access.</p>
<p><strong>Naive description</strong> An intimate part of my consciousness is its tie to long-term memory. If you show me a video of me going scuba diving this morning, and I absolutely have no memory whatsoever of it, and you can prove that the video is real, well I mean, I don't know what to say, I must have been unconscious or something!</p>
<p><strong>...and corresponding sophisticated description:</strong> Essentially everything that enters the GNW leaves at least a slight trace in long-term memory. Thus, one aspect of my attention schema is that it describes attention and memory as inextricably linked. According to my internal models, when attention ""takes possession"" of some piece of information, it leaves a trace in long-term memory, and conversely, nothing can get into long-term memory unless attention first takes possession of it.</p>
<p><strong>Naive description:</strong> Hey, hey, what are you going on about ""internal models"" and ""attention schema""? I don't know anything about that. I know what my consciousness is, I can feel it. It's not a model, it's not a computation, it's not a physical thing. (And don't call me naive!)</p>
<p><strong>...and corresponding sophisticated description:</strong> All my internal models are simplified entities, containing their essential behavior and properties, but not usually capturing the nuts-and-bolts of how they work in the real world. (In a programming analogy, you could say that we're modeling the GNW's API &amp; documentation, not its implementation.) Thus, my attention schema does not involve neurons or synapses or GNWs or anything like that, even if, in reality, that's what it's modeling.</p>
<h1>The meta-problem of consciousness</h1>
<p>The ""hard problem of consciousness"" is ""why is there an experience of consciousness; why does information processing feel like anything at all?""</p>
<p>The ""meta-problem of consciousness"" is ""why do people believe that there's a hard problem of consciousness?""</p>
<p>The meta-problem has the advantage of having obvious and non-confusing methods of attack: the belief that there's a hard problem of consciousness is an observable output of the brain, and can be studied by normal cognitive neuroscience.</p>
<p>But the real head-scratcher is: If we have a complete explanation of the meta-problem, is there anything left to explain regarding the hard problem? Graziano's answer seems to be a resounding ""No!"", and we end up with conversations like these:</p>
<p><strong>Normal Person:</strong> What about qualia?</p>
<p><strong>Person Who Has Solved The Meta-Problem Of Consciousness:</strong> Let me explain why the brain, as an information processing system, would ask the question ""What about qualia""...</p>
<p><strong>NP:</strong> What about subjective experience?</p>
<p><strong>PWHSTMPOC:</strong> Let me explain why the brain, as an information processing system, would ask the question ""What about subjective experience""...</p>
<p><strong>NP:</strong> You're not answering my questions!</p>
<p><strong>PWHSTMPOC:</strong> Let me explain why the brain, as an information processing system, would say ""You're not answering my questions""...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The book goes through this type of discussion several times. I feel a bit torn. One side of me says: obviously Graziano's answers are correct, and obviously no other answer is possible. The other side of me says: No no no, he did not actually answer these questions!!</p>
<p>On reflection, I have to side with ""Obviously Graziano's are correct, and no other answer is possible."" But I still find it annoying and deeply unsatisfying.</p>
<p>(<em>Update:</em> A commenter points me to <a href=""https://www.openphilanthropy.org/2017-report-consciousness-and-moral-patienthood#AppendixF"">Luke Muehlhauser's report on consciousness Appendix F</a> for ideas and further reading. Having read a <em>bit</em> more, I still find this line of thought counterintuitive, but less so.) (<em>Update 2</em>: Ditto <a href=""https://handsandcities.com/2020/11/29/grokking-illusionism/"">Joe Carlsmith's blog</a>.)</p>
<h1>Illusionism</h1>
<p>Graziano says that his theory is within the philosophical school of thought called ""Illusionism"". But he thinks that term is misleading. He says it's not ""illusion as in mirage"", but ""illusion as in mental construction"", like how everything we see is an ""illusion"" rather than raw perceptual data.</p>
<p><em>Edited to add</em>: Graziano makes illusionism sound very straightforward and unobjectionable. Maybe he has a way to think about it such that it <em>really is</em> straightforward and unobjectionable. ...Or maybe he's dancing around the counterintuitive or controversial aspects of his theory, to make it more palatable to a broad audience. I'm inclined to think it's the latter. There's another example of this elsewhere in the book: his discussion of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_information_theory"">Integrated Information Theory</a>. He could have just said ""IIT is baloney"" and I would have been totally on board. <a href=""https://jakerhanson.weebly.com/blog/my-graduate-experience-with-integrated-information-theory-iit"">I think IIT is fundamentally wrong</a>; it was an interesting idea to look into, but let's now put it in the garbage and move on. And that's exactly what Graziano's theory implies. But Graziano doesn't say that. Instead, as I recall, he has a <em>scrupulously non-confrontational</em> discussion of how the GNW stuff he talks about involves a lot of integration of information in a way that the IIT ""Φ"" calculation would endorse as conscious. So, I think he wants to pick his battles, and that's why he dances around how weird and unintuitive illusionism really is. I could be wrong.</p>
<h1>Emulations</h1>
<p>He has a fun chapter on brain uploading, which is not particularly related to the rest of the book. He discusses some fascinating neuroscience aspects of brain-scanning, like the mystery of whether glial cells do computations, but spends most of the time speculating about the bizarre implications for society.</p>
<h1>Implications for AGI safety</h1>
<p>He suggests that, since humans are generally pro-social, and part of that comes from modeling each other using attention schemas, perhaps the cause of AGI Safety could be advanced by deliberately building conscious AGIs with attention schemas (and, I presume, other human-like emotions). Now, he's not a particular expert on AGI Safety, but I think this is not an unreasonable idea; in fact it's one that I'm very interested in myself. (We don't have to <em>blindly</em> copy human emotions ... we can turn off jealousy etc.)</p>
<h1>Implications for morality</h1>
<p>One issue where Graziano is largely silent is the implications for moral philosophy.</p>
<p>For example, someday we'll have to decide: When we build AGIs, should we assign them moral weight? Is it OK to turn them off? Are our AGIs suffering? How would we know? Should we care? If humans go extinct but conscious AGIs have rich experiences as they colonize the universe, do we think of them as our children/successors? Or as our hated conquerers in a now-empty clockwork universe?</p>
<p>I definitely share the common intuition is that we should care about the suffering of things that are conscious (and/or sentient, I'm not sure what the difference is). However, in attention schema theory, there does not seem to be a sharp dividing line between ""things with an attention schema"" and ""things without an attention schema"", especially in the wide space of all possible computations. There are (presumably) computations that arguably involve something like an ""attention schema"" but with radically alien properties. There doesn't seem to be any good reason that, out of all the possible computational processes in the universe, we should care only and exactly about computations involving an attention schema. Instead, the picture I get is more like we're taking an ad-hoc abstract internal model and thoughtlessly reifying it. It's like if somebody worshipped the concept of pure whiteness, and went searching the universe for things that match that template, only to discover that white is a mixture of colors, and thus pure whiteness—when taken to be a literal description of a real-world phenomenon—simply doesn't exist. What then?</p>
<p>It's a mess.</p>
<p>So, as usual when I start thinking too hard about philosophy, I wind up back at Dentin's <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/KLaJjNdENsHhKhG5m/ontological-crisis-in-humans?commentId=mnT4ub9WbT4WdQ4FL"">Prayer of the Altruistic Nihilist</a>:</p>
<p><em>Why do I exist? Because the universe happens to be set up this way. Why do I care (about anything or everything)? Simply because my genetics, atoms, molecules, and processing architecture are set up in a way that happens to care.</em></p>
<p>So, where does that leave us? Well, I definitely care about people. If I met an AGI that was pretty much exactly like a nice person, inside and out, I would care about it too (for direct emotional reasons), and I would feel that caring about it is the right thing to do (for intellectual consistency reasons). For AGIs running more alien types of algorithms—man, I just have no idea.</p>

Unlike an FSM, where the next arc is chosen by a symbol from some input stream, here the next arc is chosen randomly - so each arc has a probability associated with it. An example:</p><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/KEZzAge6mgyo5GDi9/qkkj9kny2zwcq2pc4pa1"" srcset=""https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/KEZzAge6mgyo5GDi9/iyjyrqh1gwzi1s3f7bv3 156w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/KEZzAge6mgyo5GDi9/egbg4niznkavhnrvi9x1 236w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/KEZzAge6mgyo5GDi9/pfd8jc6m0zdpkkwzwrxt 316w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/KEZzAge6mgyo5GDi9/mi1yqreeickvk5jvzfip 396w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/KEZzAge6mgyo5GDi9/qqac7ce9pbzwq789amgs 476w""></figure><p>This is NOT a causal diagram, it is a state transition diagram. It says that, if the system is in state 1, then at the next timestep it will randomly transition to state 1, 2, or 5. (I haven’t included the probabilities on each arc; all that matters for our purposes is that each arc shown has nonzero probability.) Since we have two graph representations of the system (the state transition diagram and the causal DAG), I will generally refer to vertices in the state transition diagram “states” and vertices&nbsp;<span><span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""X_t""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base"" style=""margin-right: -0.024em;""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em;

In the example above, nodes 5 &amp; 6 will have the same long-run distribution, and nodes 2, 3, 4 will have the same long-run distribution.</p><p>To see why, imagine what happens if we start in state 5, assuming that the 5 -&gt; 6 transition is much more likely than the 5 -&gt; 5 transition. Well, since 5 -&gt; 6 is much more likely than 5 -&gt; 5, we’ll probably jump to state 6 next. And state 6 always jumps back to 5, so in two steps we’ll be back to 5. And so forth - back and forth, alternating between state 5 and 6 every timestep. But every one in awhile, we’ll jump from 5 -&gt; 5, throwing the back-and-forth oscillation out of sync. If we imagine two copies of this chain running side-by-side, they’d start out oscillating in sync, but eventually drift out of sync. If we walk away for a while and look back at the chain much later, we’d expect that it’s roughly equally likely to be in state 5 or 6, regardless of which it started in.</p><p>That’s the key: if the chain started in state 5 or 6, with 5 -&gt; 6 much more likely than 5 -&gt; 5, than after a while, it would be roughly equally likely to be in state 5 or state 6.&nbsp;<span><span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""P[X_{t+m} | X_t = 5] \approx P[X_{t+m} | X_t = 6]""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em;

<p>The requirements for a candidate collaborator are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Must: The knowledge required to understand the paper in full, including all the technical details. It is fine if ey need to refresh eir memory or look up particular theorems / definitions, but ey need to have enough background for that to be efficient. To see what sort of knowledge is necessary, one is advised to skim the paper. Mostly it involves measure theory, probability theory and functional analysis.</p>

<p>Immoral Mazes are terrible places to be. Much worse than they naively appear. They promise the rewards and trappings of success. Do not be fooled. </p>
<p>If there is one takeaway I want everyone to get from the whole discussion of <em>Moral Mazes</em>, it is this:</p>
<p><b>Being in an immoral maze is not worth it. They couldn’t pay you enough. Even if they could, they definitely don’t. If you end up CEO, you still lose. These lives are not worth it. Do not be a middle manager at a major corporation or other organization that works like this. Do not sell your soul.</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>When one works for an immoral maze, what is one hoping for? What is success?</p>
<p>Suppose you persevere. You make the sacrifices. Become the person you need to become. Put in the work day after day. Fortune smiles on you and you win out against all the others doing the same thing. You succeed. </p>
<p>What is success? What do you get in exchange?</p>
<blockquote><p>For some managers, the drive for success is a quest for the generous financial rewards that high corporate position brings. For others, success means the freedom to define one’s work role with some latitude, to “get out from under the thumb of others.” For still others, it means the chance to gain power and to exert one’s will, to “call the shots,” to “do it my way,” or to know the curiously exhilarating pleasure of controlling other people’s fates. For still others, the quest for success expresses a deep hunger for the recognition and accolades of one’s peers. (Location 955, Quote 118)</p></blockquote>
<p>This a warning. “Success,” in context, does not mean happiness. It does not make you healthy. It does not improve your reproductive fitness. It does not reflect or spread the values that you (one would hope) had when you stared down that road.</p>
<p>It gives you money. But in terms of actual meaningful personal consumption, you can’t really do much with it beyond status competitions. If you had plans to do something good with the money, by the time the day arrives, it is highly unlikely you’ll do it. You have changed yourself to succeed on your journey. </p>
<p>Even after you ‘succeed’ you probably keep putting tons of hours into the job in ways no amount of money can compensate for, once you already had basically enough.</p>
<p>What was the point? What are you even doing?</p>
<p>Note that failure is indeed much worse than success. You still paid all the sunk costs, including everything you are. You’ve invested a ton in and become very invested in local status hierarchies, and in the quest to climb them, which you have failed. Being ‘under the thumb’ of others who succeeded where you failed is deeply unpleasant – and is the most likely outcome, since the math says most who try will fail.</p>
<p>This is a song with some<a href=""http://benjaminrosshoffman.com/explicit-content/""> explicit content</a> about what happens when one disregards this warning, and chooses poorly, although it misses perhaps the most important questions. Who am I? What have I become?</p>

<p>Remember that maze conditions are not unique to corporations.</p>
<p>All of this holds true in any sufficiently large organization, to an extent that increases with its size, and will have the same effects if you seek to ascend the hierarchy within.</p>
<p>Size matters, but size is far from the only thing that matters. Some very small organizations effectively have very high maze levels. Some large organizations have <em>relatively </em>low maze levels.</p>
<p>Avoiding mazes is easier said than done. The first step is <i>identifying </i>them, where I will offer some heuristics in the next post. </p>
<p>The second step after that is what to do about it, especially in difficult circumstances. Many of us believe we need the support of mazes in order to survive. At least for the moment, not all of us are wrong. </p>",Zvi,zvi,Zvi,

Flipside of <a href=""http://mindingourway.com/half-assing-it-with-everything-youve-got/"">Half-assing it with everything you've got</a>.</em></p>
<p>Do you ever feel... fake? Like, at any minute, Scooby Doo and the gang might roll up and unmask you as a <em>freeloading fraud <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome"">impostor</a> in front of everyone</em>?</p>
<p><img src=""https://i.imgur.com/rwcNnVH.gif"" alt=""""></p>
<p>There are a lot of things to say about the impostor syndrome on a psychological basis (the fears are often unrealistic / unmerited, etc). But I'd like to take another angle. For a few years, I've tried to just make a habit of <em>being un-unmaskable</em>. Although this is a useful frame for me, your mileage may vary.</p>
<p>My point isn't going to just be ""do the things you know you should"". I think we're often bad at judging when corners are okay to cut, so you probably do better just by having the policy of not cutting corners, unless it's <em>extremely obviously</em> alright to do so. That is, generally err against using scissors when confronted with corners, even if it makes sense in the moment.</p>

This <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/MjZSdPEd94sp48EFC/judgment-day-insights-from-judgment-in-managerial-decision#JgPP9aLLuBdprThNR"">doesn't mean one should freak out about the Math Gestapo checking whether you've memorized what Jordan normal form is</a>. Rather... when I was just beginning to learn formal proof-based math, I worried ""I'm about to go work with some of the smartest people in the world, and they'll instantly see I'm a fake who just picked up shallow knowledge"". The internal response was ""just get good enough that in <em>no conceivable world</em> could you be a fake who secretly can't do formal math"".</li>
<li>Working out regularly, taking care of the small things, building the key good habits. Having your shit together.</li>

<li>Following best practices (e.g. when writing code, so there isn't a secret layer of gross code underneath the most prominent functions; when dealing with git repos, so future collaboration / merging works out okay).</li>

</ul>
<h1>The general philosophy</h1>
<p>This robustness is a kind of epistemic humility - it's the kind of reasoning that robustly avoids the planning fallacy, only generalized. It's the kind of reasoning that double-checks answers before turning in the test. It's best practices, but for your own life.</p>
<p>I try to live my mental life such that, if people could read my thoughts, they would think I'm doing things right. That doesn't mean I'm always being polite to people in my mind, but it means that I'm not being deceitful, or unfair, or secretly cutting corners on work I'm doing for them.<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-PX6LZg4HLi5oA9TQR-2"" id=""fnref-PX6LZg4HLi5oA9TQR-2"">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Again, the point isn't ""have good habits and be happy"". The point is that I think we often cut too many corners, and so I recommend a policy which leans towards <em>not</em> cutting corners (even when it locally makes sense). The benefits for me have been twofold: getting better results, and feeling more secure about myself while getting those results.</p>

""Entertainer"" systems supported contra dances everywhere:

</p>

<p>

It's a 10-channel mixer, with 8 XLR inputs and two high-impedance 1/4""
inputs.  It has two powered output channels, one for mains and one for
monitors.  Three-band parametric EQ, eight-band graphic EQ on the
mains and monitors, and phantom power.  It came out in the late 1970s
or early 1980s, and it's impressive how far ahead of its time it is.



</p>

<p>

Forty years later it seems to me like the last few dances that were
using Entertainers are moving on. I wanted I wanted to know more about
their history, so I called <a href=""http://www.configular.com/"">Walter
Lenk</a>.  Walter has been working in audio professionally since the
early 1970s, <a href=""http://www.configular.com/design/projects.html"">building custom
audio equipment, designing systems, and running sound</a>.  He had a
lot to tell me!

</p>

<p>

Before about 1980 there weren't good options for this sort of sound
reinforcement gig.  Most groups were running 6-channel mono
mixer-amplifiers like the Shure Vocal Master:

</p>

<p>

<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/shure-vocal-master-big.jpg""><img src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/2DHoiYLgd9CLb7G9h/hfwm0ujmjlxbssp7xeal"" width=""550"" height=""309"" class=""mobile-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:100.0vw; max-height:56.2vw;"" srcset=""https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/2DHoiYLgd9CLb7G9h/hfwm0ujmjlxbssp7xeal 550w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/2DHoiYLgd9CLb7G9h/envbyooxak56l1v0wksd 1100w""></a>

</p>

<p>

With only a single output channel, you can't run a separate monitor
mix, and what is helpful to for the band to hear is often very
different than what's helpful to the people in the hall.

</p>

<p>

The Entertainer came out in 1981, and was a huge improvement.  It
could run two output channels, mains and monitors, each piece was
relatively light, and while it wasn't very powerful it had automatic
limiters on the amplifier that would slightly turn down the gain as
needed.

</p>

Walter remembers seeing one at a trade show in New York in Fall 1981
and buying one as soon as he got back to Boston.  He was very
impressed with it, bought several more, and convinced a lot of
Boston-area folks to get them.  He also remembers writing a piece for
the <a href=""https://www.cdss.org/programs/cdss-news-publications/cdss-news"">CDSS
News</a> where he talked about systems and recommended the
Entertainer.

<p>

One remarkable thing about the Entertainer system is that it remained
a reasonable choice for most groups for decades, with many groups
buying used ones after EV stopped selling them.  It was ahead of its
time, but the combination of a separate mix for monitors and a
relatively low maximum volume left it a bit niche.  It was a good fit
for churches and folk dances, but rock bands generally wanted
something louder and didn't care as much about having separate
monitors.  Still, they were a good fit for us, and we got an
impressive amount of service out of them!

<p>What really is outer alignment? In “<a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01820"">Risks from Learned Optimization</a>,” we defined outer alignment in the context of machine learning as “aligning the specified loss function with the intended goal.” But that's not a perfectly well-defined statement—what does it mean for a loss function to be “aligned” with the intended goal? If the goal we care about is maximizing <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""U""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.084em;"">U</span></span></span></span></span></span>, do we need exactly <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""L = -aU + b""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">L</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.077em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">=</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.298em; padding-bottom: 0.446em;"">−</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">a</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.084em;"">U</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space2""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.298em; padding-bottom: 0.446em;"">+</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi MJXc-space2""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">b</span></span></span></span></span></span> for constants <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""a, b""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">a</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""margin-top: -0.144em; padding-bottom: 0.519em;"">,</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi MJXc-space1""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">b</span></span></span></span></span></span>? That's a pretty high bar.</p>
<p>Well, what exactly do we want outer alignment for? At the end of the day, we care about whether the model that pops out the other end of our training procedure will be safe, which is a complicated question involving the loss function, the architecture, the implicit inductive biases, and so on. In what sense, then, is it even reasonable to look at just the lost function in isolation and ask whether it's aligned or not?</p>
<p>I think the strongest case for outer alignment being a meaningful problem in isolation comes from the argument that loss functions seem to scale pretty well with generic machine learning progress. If, as a silly example, your outer alignment scheme is to “train image classification models,” that's something that ML has progressively gotten better at over time. Compare that to the silly inner alignment scheme of “train a straightforward CNN”—that's something that ML has passed by pretty rapidly in favor of architectural improvements like residual connections even just for the task of image classification. Of course, outer alignment alone does not an aligned AGI make, so you still have to have some notion of how you're going to do inner alignment in mind—but loss functions scaling better is still a perfectly valid reason for focusing on outer alignment.<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-wY7Ni5JBsYFJxwg7g-1"" id=""fnref-wY7Ni5JBsYFJxwg7g-1"">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Thus, it does seem quite reasonable to me to put effort into finding “aligned” loss functions. But that still brings us back to the question of what exactly makes a loss function “aligned.” In the context of a specific training/inner alignment scheme, we can say that a loss function is aligned if, when plugged into that training scheme, it produces models which are aligned with our goals. But in the absence of any specific training scheme, what does it mean to say that a loss function is aligned in isolation? We can of course ask for <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""L = -aU + b""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">L</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.077em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">=</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.298em; padding-bottom: 0.446em;"">−</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">a</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.084em;"">U</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space2""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.298em; padding-bottom: 0.446em;"">+</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi MJXc-space2""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">b</span></span></span></span></span></span> as I stated previously, though in my opinion I think achieving something like that is likely to be nearly impossible.</p>
<h2>Outer alignment at optimum</h2>
<p>I think there is another version of “outer aligned in isolation,” however, which is both meaningful and (at least somewhat) achievable which I will call <em>outer aligned at optimum.</em> Intuitively, I will say that a loss function is <em>outer aligned at optimum</em> if all the possible models that perform optimally according to that loss function are aligned with our goals—that is, they are at least <a href=""https://ai-alignment.com/clarifying-ai-alignment-cec47cd69dd6"">trying to do what we want</a>.

<p>That's the definition—now why should we care? In basically any practical setting we're never going to reach perfect loss, so why should it matter if those functions which do have perfect loss are aligned or not? In my opinion, I think there is a strong argument for loss functions which are aligned at optimum being significantly less susceptible to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law"">Goodhart's Law</a> as we scale up ML capabilities. Suppose you know that a loss function <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""L""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">L</span></span></span></span></span></span> is aligned for current ML capabilities. When you then scale up those capabilities and push harder on minimizing <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""L""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">L</span></span></span></span></span></span>, you immediately run into all the issues of Goodhart's Law where <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""L""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">L</span></span></span></span></span></span> can quickly cease to be a good proxy for alignment as you push harder on it. If you have a guarantee that <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""L""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">L</span></span></span></span></span></span> is aligned at optimum, however, then, while still quite possible, it's a lot harder for Goodhart's Law to bite you. In particular, if you think about the <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/EbFABnst8LsidYs5Y/goodhart-taxonomy"">Goodhart taxonomy</a>, alignment at optimum almost entirely rules out both Causal and Extremal Goodhart—since you know the relationship is valid and doesn't break down at the extremes—and ensures that Regressional and Adversarial Goodhart won't show up in the limit, though you could still see them before that point. Though this obviously doesn't just give you an alignment guarantee—before you get to the true optimum, you can still get Regressional Goodhart biting you through <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/r9tYkB2a8Fp4DN8yB/p/pL56xPoniLvtMDQ4J"">proxy alignment</a> or Adversarial Goodhart biting you through <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/zthDPAjh9w6Ytbeks/deceptive-alignment"">deceptive alignment</a>, for example—I think it is nevertheless still a very nice thing to have.</p>
<h2>The case for imitative amplification</h2>
<p>With all of that being said, I can get to the reason that I want to talk about all of this: I think that specifically what I will call <em>imitative amplification</em>—in contrast to other <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/EmDuGeRw749sD3GKd"">amplification</a>-based approaches or <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00899"">debate</a>-based approaches—has a strong claim to being outer aligned at optimum.<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-wY7Ni5JBsYFJxwg7g-2"" id=""fnref-wY7Ni5JBsYFJxwg7g-2"">[2]</a></sup> Specifically, when I say <em>imitative amplification,</em> I mean the class of training procedures which are attempting to produce models which approximate <a href=""https://ai-alignment.com/strong-hch-bedb0dc08d4e"">HCH</a> as closely as possible. As a concrete example, consider the scheme where you train a model to minimize the difference between its output and the output of a human consulting that model. I want to contrast this with <em>approval-based amplification,</em> by which I mean the class of training procedures where the loss is generated using an approval signal from an amplified overseer. As a concrete example, consider the scheme where you train a model to maximize the extent to which a human consulting that model would approve of that model's output.<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-wY7Ni5JBsYFJxwg7g-3"" id=""fnref-wY7Ni5JBsYFJxwg7g-3"">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>So, why does imitative amplification have a stronger case for being outer aligned at optimum than approval-based amplification or debate? Well, precisely because we know what the optimum of imitative amplification is—it's HCH—whereas we really don't know what perfect approval-based amplification or perfect debate look like.<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-wY7Ni5JBsYFJxwg7g-4"" id=""fnref-wY7Ni5JBsYFJxwg7g-4"">[4]</a></sup> Though <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/S7csET9CgBtpi7sCh/challenges-to-christiano-s-capability-amplification-proposal"">some challenges have been raised regarding whether HCH is actually aligned or not</a>, I tend to be fairly skeptical of these challenges—HCH is just a bunch of humans after all and if you can instruct them not to do things like instantiate arbitrary Turing machines, then I think a bunch of humans put together has a strong case for being aligned.<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-wY7Ni5JBsYFJxwg7g-5"" id=""fnref-wY7Ni5JBsYFJxwg7g-5"">[5]</a></sup> That being said, the same argument does not at all apply to approval-based amplification or debate.</p>
<p>First, let's consider approval-based amplification.<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-wY7Ni5JBsYFJxwg7g-6"" id=""fnref-wY7Ni5JBsYFJxwg7g-6"">[6]</a></sup> We know what the optimum of imitative amplification looks like—but what is the optimum of approval-based amplification? At first glance, one might imagine that the optimum of approval-based amplification looks like a model whose output is selected to be maximally approved of by HCH. That's very much not the case for the approval-based scheme I described earlier, however. If each step of training is done via maximizing an approval signal, then instead of a tree of just humans you get a tree of humans interspersed with models trying to maximize the approval that their descendants in the tree would assign to their answers. And if you think that human approval can be gamed—which seems extremely likely in my opinion given that we see exactly that sort of gaming happening in our world already all the time—then this is very much not a safe tree. Now, one could make the argument that approval-based amplification can just become imitative amplification if the humans determine their approval by computing a distance function between what they would have said and what the model produced as its output. For example, you could ask your humans to come up with their answers first, then show them the model's answer and ask them to rate how close it was. I'm pretty skeptical of this approach, however—it doesn't seem at all clear to me that this gets around the approval-gaming problem, since the humans still get to see the model's answer and doing so could significantly change how they're thinking about the rating problem.<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-wY7Ni5JBsYFJxwg7g-7"" id=""fnref-wY7Ni5JBsYFJxwg7g-7"">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>Now, second, let's consider debate with a human judge. In many ways, debate was designed as an approach meant to fix the problems of approval-based reward signals. With a standard approval-based reward signal, the argument goes, it's easy to be tricked by a bad argument that you don't fully understand. In a debate setup, however, you get the benefit of having two competing systems trying to point out flaws in each other's arguments, which hopefully should prevent you from being tricked by bad arguments and thus fix the approval-gaming problem. I'm not convinced, though—false things can be significantly easier to argue for than true things just because there are fewer ways to attack them, they're more rhetorically powerful, or any other number of possible ways in which an argument can be subtly wrong yet still persuasive.<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-wY7Ni5JBsYFJxwg7g-8"" id=""fnref-wY7Ni5JBsYFJxwg7g-8"">[8]</a></sup> Regardless, however, I think the more fundamental objection is just that we really have no way of knowing what optimal play in debate looks like, which makes it very difficult to ever know whether it is outer aligned at optimum or not. With HCH, we know that it just looks like a tree of humans, which at least means we can reason about the parts and how they interact. With optimal debate, however, we have to somehow analyze, understand, and be confident in the alignment of superhuman play on a game involving humans assessing arbitrary strings of characters, which is something that in my opinion seems extremely difficult to do.</p>
<h2>Addressing competitiveness concerns</h2>
<p>All of that is an argument for why we should prefer imitative amplification from an alignment standpoint. However, there's also the problem of imitative amplification just not being competitive in terms of capabilities with other approaches. First of all, I think it's important to remember the importance of putting safety first—<em>if something isn't safe, then we shouldn't build it.</em> Of course, arms race dynamics could end up pushing one's hand into going with a best available current option in order to beat some other team which one believes will produce an AI which is even less likely to be safe, though I think it's important to remember that that's a <em>last resort,</em> not the default option. Furthermore, even in such a situation, it's still probably fine to eat an overhead cost that is just something like a constant factor worse.</p>
<p>With that being said, I still think there are strong arguments to be made for why imitative amplification can be done competitively. First, like the silly outer alignment scheme of “just train an image classification model” from earlier, imitative amplification gets to piggy-back off of generic ML progress. Imitative amplification is just a language modeling problem, which means generic progress on language modeling should generally be transferable to imitative amplification. Second, I think there is a strong case for language being sufficiently rich as a dataset for training an AGI (EDIT: where “language” is construed to also include embedded images, videos, etc.), at least for the sorts of tasks which I think you will want to use your first AGI for.<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-wY7Ni5JBsYFJxwg7g-9"" id=""fnref-wY7Ni5JBsYFJxwg7g-9"">[9]</a></sup> For example, if the primary/most important purpose of your first AGI is to help you build your second AGI by helping you improve your AGI design, that's the sort of highly cognitive task which I think language is sufficient for. Certainly, if you needed your first AGI to be able to do fine motor control to be competitive, then imitative amplification probably won't get you there—but it seems pretty unlikely to me that ability to do fine motor control will be an important desiderata. Third, a common criticism of imitative amplification is that because imitation treats all data points the same, it won't be able to focus on the most important ones. However, that's not something that's fundamental to the task of imitation. For example, you could use <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_learning_(machine_learning)"">active learning</a> to select the most important data points rather than just using a fixed curriculum.<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-wY7Ni5JBsYFJxwg7g-10"" id=""fnref-wY7Ni5JBsYFJxwg7g-10"">[10]</a></sup> Or, you could even weight different data points in your imitation loss using some outside importance criterion while still maintaining the guarantee of perfect imitation at optimum.</p>
<p>Regardless, I think the case for imitative amplification's safety is a strong argument in favor of at least focusing on figuring out whether it works and is safe first, before we give up and move to other approaches. Furthermore, even if imitative amplification on its own isn't competitive, I don't think that means we have to abandon it completely—there are modifications to imitative amplification that can be made to help improve competitiveness without sacrificing all of its benefits. For example, you could do reward-modeling-based distillation (e.g. RL + IRL as the distillation step) instead of imitation-based distillation, which, while not imitative (as the optimum isn't HCH anymore), also isn't based on human approval, which could be a nice property. Alternatively, you could first train an HCH model, and then use that model as the judge to train a debate model, which could have significant benefits over just using a human judge. While I don't think we should be focusing on those sorts of things now, the fact that such options exist makes it more likely that imitative amplification work can transfer to future approaches even if imitative amplification itself ends up not being competitive. In any event, I think the case for focusing on imitative amplification right now both from an outer alignment perspective as well as from a competitiveness perspective is quite strong.<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-wY7Ni5JBsYFJxwg7g-11"" id=""fnref-wY7Ni5JBsYFJxwg7g-11"">[11]</a></sup></p>

For the full experience, see <a href=""https://acesounderglass.com/2019/12/31/criticism-as-entertainment/"">here</a>.

<h2>Media Reviews</h2>
<p>There is a popular genre of video that consist of shitting on other people’s work without any generative content. Let me provide some examples.</p>
<p>First, Cinema Sins. This is the first video I selected when looking for a movie I’d seen with a Cinema Sins I hadn’t (i.e. it’s not random, but it wasn’t selected for being particularly good or bad).</p>
<div></div>
<p>The first ten sins are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use of a consistent brand for props in the movie they’d have to have anyway, unobtrusively enough that I never noticed until Cinema Sins pointed it out.</li>
<li>A character being mildly unreasonable to provoke exposition.</li>
<li>The logo</li>
<li>Exposition that wasn’t perfectly justified in-story</li>
<li>A convenience about what was shown on screen</li>
<li>A font choice (from an entity that in-universe would plausibly make bad font choices)</li>
<li>An omission that will nag at you if you think about it long enough or expect the MCU to be a completely different thing, with some information about why it happened.</li>
<li>In-character choices that would be concerning in the real world and I would argue are treated appropriately by the movie, although reasonable people could disagree</li>
<li>Error by character that was <em>extremely obviously</em> intentional on the part of the film makers. There is no reasonable disagreement on this point.</li>
<li>An error perfectly in keeping with what we know about the character.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of those, three to four could even plausibly be called sins of the movie- and if those bother you, maybe the MCU is not for you. The rest are deliberate choices by filmmakers to have characters do imperfect things. Everyone gets to draw their own line on characters being dumb- mine is after this movie but before 90s sitcoms running on miscommunication- but that’s irrelevant to this post because Cinema Sins is not helping you determine where a particular movie is relative to your line. Every video makes the movie sound exactly as bad as the last, regardless of the quality of the underlying movie. It’s like they analyze the dialogue sentence by sentence and look to see if there’s anything that could be criticized about it.</p>
<p>Pitch Meeting is roughly as useful, but instead of reacting to sentences, it’s reading the plot summary in a sarcastic tone of voice.</p>
<div></div>
<p>Pitch Meeting is at least bringing up actual problems with Game of Thrones season 8. But I dare you to tell if early Game of Thrones was better or worse than season 8, based on the Pitch Meeting.</p>
<div></div>
<p>I keep harping on “You can’t judge movie quality by the review”, but I don’t actually think that’s the biggest problem. Or rather, it’s a subset of the problem, which is you don’t learn anything from the review: not whether the reviewer considered the movie “good” or not, and not what could be changed to do make it better. Contrast with <a href=""http://www.escapistmagazine.com/v2/category/zero-punctuation/"">Zero Punctuation</a>, a video game review series notorious for being criticism-as-entertainment, that nonetheless occasionally likes things, and at least once per episode displays a deep understanding of the problems of a game and what might be done to fix it.</p>
<h2><div></div></h2>
<h2>Why Are You Talking About This?</h2>
<p>It’s really, really easy to make something look bad, and the short-term rewards to doing so are high. You never risk looking stupid or having to issue a correction. It’s easier to make criticism funny. You get to feel superior. Not to mention the sheer joy in punishing bad things. But it’s corrosive. I’ve already covered (harped on) how useless shitting-on videos are for learning or improvement, but it goes deeper than that. Going in with those intentions changes how you watch the movie. It makes flaws more salient and good parts less so. You become literally less able to enjoy or learn from the original work.</p>
<p>Maybe this isn’t universal, but for me there is definitely a trade off between “groking the author’s concepts” and “interrogating the author’s concepts and evidence”. Groking is a good word here: it mostly means understand, but includes playing with the idea and applying it what I know.  That’s very difficult to do while simultaneously looking for flaws.</p>
<p>Should it be, though? Generating testable hypotheses should lead to greater understanding and trust or less trust, depending on the correctness of the book. So at least one of my investigation or groking procedures are wrong.</p>

<p>This is my ordering of the core Star Wars movies:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Empire Strikes Back &gt; Return of the Jedi &gt;= The Last Jedi &gt; Rogue One &gt; A New Hope = The Rise of Skywalker &gt; The Force Awakens &gt; Revenge of the Sith &gt;&gt; Attack of the Clones &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The Phantom Menace</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm sure that nobody will disagree with me or find these rankings in any way controversial ^_^</p>
<p>But I'm really posting these here to illustrate how <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CSEdLLEkap2pubjof/research-agenda-v0-9-synthesising-a-human-s-preferences-into"">preferences can be synthesised</a> from <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/2vnJmWDAaLKDayvwr/toy-model-piece-4-partial-preferences-re-re-visited"">partial preferences</a>.</p>
<p>Because that order didn't exist in my head, I had to synthesise it, fitting various arguments and orderings together. Had I done it at a different time, or in a different mood, I would have had a substantially different ordering.</p>
<p>A few things were probably invariant, though. The quality of ""The Empire Strikes Back"" was clear in my head, as was the terribleness of ""The Phantom Menace"". ""A New Hope"" and ""The Force Awakens"" were easy to compare, being essentially the same movie.</p>
<p>But how did I compare ""The Last Jedi"", which I found to be an inconsistent sprawling mess with some of the most beautiful scenes in all of Star Wars (and the ""old hero retired"" trope, which I really enjoy), with ""A New Hope"", a tightly scripted elegant adventure story with little depth? And what about ""Return of the Jedi"", which has a great ending, a decent beginning, but a muddelish middle?</p>
<p>Well, Scott has defined <a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/05/05/ambijectivity/"">ambijectivity</a>, which allows one to say that comparisons like ""Mozart’s music is better than Beethoven’s"" is subjective, while ""Mozart’s music is better than the music of the three-year old girl who lives upstairs from me and bangs on her toy piano sometimes"" is more objective.</p>
<p>The idea is that there are hundreds of different ways in which we can compare things, and some of these are simple enough that they have an easy objective or subjective answer. And Mozart and Beethoven are tend to beat each other roughly equally on the more objective criteria, and can go either way on the subjective ones.</p>
<p>But they both tend to beat the three-year old on almost all criteria.</p>
<h2>How I ordered the movies</h2>
<p>So, in comparing the Star Wars movies, I stated with a few clear orderings, and then compared movies based on criteria I felt were relevant. For example, ""Return of the Jedi"" and ""The Rise of Skywalker"" are reasonably similar, and though I found Kylo Ren an interesting character, Vader is... Vader. Iconic characters and emotional arcs were used here.</p>
<p>""Rogue one"" is tricky, as it's great on many criteria, but isn't maybe as enjoyable to watch as some of the other moves (in most ways more realistic, more tragic). I could have put it in many different locations, depending on what I emphasised (emotional arcs would have put it lower; exciting story would have put it higher; showing the cost of war would have put it higher, and so on).</p>
<p>I was aware that I would be presenting the ordering to the public, and this made me more likely to use arguments that I could defend. For example, I personally really liked ""The Rise of Skywalker"", but felt I couldn't justify (to myself or others) putting above ""A New Hope"". And do the original movies get a bonus for their originality? Maybe. In different moods, I could prefer different movies, quite easily.</p>
<p>After filling out a few orders, I then tried to make everything transitive, comparing a few of the movies one with another, and trying to collapse my circular preferences. There are two places where equal signs snuck in; note that these are pairs that are particularly hard to compare, and they gained the equal (or &gt;=) sign mainly because I sorted out their relative ranking with the other movies and then really couldn't compare them well with each other.</p>
<p>I was also expecting to put ""Revenge of the Sith"" higher than it ultimately was. Unlike the other two prequels, I feel it was actually a decent movie, and wanted to reflect that by putting it higher; but, in any one-to-one comparisons with the other non-prequels, it ended up the loser. So it was a sort of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_criterion"">Condorcet loser</a>.</p>
<h2>Analysis of my synthesis</h2>
<p>So, how would I compare my own synthesis efforts with what I described in my <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CSEdLLEkap2pubjof/research-agenda-v0-9-synthesising-a-human-s-preferences-into"">research agenda</a>?</p>
<p>There are some similarities, to be sure. Partial preferences, and some things that might be defined as meta preferences (not wanting circular preferences, preferring defensible criteria, my ultimately frustrated desire to show that ""Revenge of the Sith"" was not a bad movie).</p>
<p>Maybe the most important point is <strong>that my preference ordering of Star Wars movies did not exist until I synthesised it</strong>, and that the synthesis process could have ended up being different. So this is evidence for the core theses of the research agenda: that making preference orderings is a constructive, synthesis process, and that it doesn't have a single clear outcome.</p>
<p>All in all, my efforts were pretty sloppy. Many movies were compared on subjective feelings, the criteria I used were generally the first or second that sprung to mind, I made no effort to be systematic, or to consider at different times and with different moods or aims. If you feel I didn't put many details in the description above - well, there weren't that many details to put.</p>
<p>In these areas, I expect that an AI could do better, could correctly compute my ""<a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/i6hWWcKyxBPj7ELT6/one-step-hypothetical-preferences"">one-step hypothetical preferences</a>"", and get a more invariant representation of my preferences. So, in that way, a preference learning AI would be like me, just better.</p>
<p>But the ""meta-preferences"" are a bit more worrying. Are they genuine meta-preferences? Especially since the second one is one that was more subconscious, and the third one looks more like a standard preference than a meta-preference. If the category of meta-preference is not clear, then that part of the research agenda needs to be improved.</p>
<p>Anyway, this is my tour through Star Wars and synthesising preferences, two burning issues of different importance.</p>

<p>Most of these are understandable errors at personalization. The violin unboxing makes sense because I listen to lots of violin music. The <em>Star Wars</em> and anime stuff makes sense because I watch ""Star Wars Anime Opening"" videos. ""不要随便让老师唱歌跳舞..."" is dancing-related. I think the movie trailers come from the fact that some of the music videos I watch take the form of movie clips. I was surprised by the science recommendations until I realized it's not difficult to infer that someone who listens to AIVA-generated music over-and-over again (among similar things) might be interested in science. The wedding highlight film could be related to the wedding dance videos I enjoy.</p>
<p>The videos in Chinese, Spanish and Japanese make sense because I listen to music in these languages. When I first created my account it recommended a lot of news, videogames and comedy (among other things). The foreign language news, videogames and comedy are generic recommendations speakers of these languages. If I click ""Don't recommend channel"" enough times they'll probably go away like they (kinda) do in English. I don't know exactly<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-5oSoEu2FcbK5yc3fv-2"" id=""fnref-5oSoEu2FcbK5yc3fv-2"">[2]</a></sup> where the French and Filipino videos came from but I expect the same goes for them too.</p>

But it&#x2019;s important not to phrase this as &#x201C;Philip Tetlock discovered that 2% of people are superforecasters&#x201D;. This suggests a discontinuity, a natural division into two groups.

I didn&apos;t really get it on a first reading, and only recently read it in enough detail that I think I understand the main ideas. This entire newsletter will focus on ascription universality; treat all of it as a &quot;Highlight&quot;.</p><p>The key idea of these posts is that of <em>universality</em>: when we can say that some agent &quot;knows everything that any other agent could know&quot;. Of course, there will always be some agent with arbitrarily complex beliefs, but we could hope to have agents that know everything that is known by any agent of some complexity class (e.g. agents that run in polynomial time). However, there are still simple programs that can have complex <em>true</em> beliefs: we could make agents that believe that P != NP and that P = NP, and one of those agents will fall into this class. However, these agents are somewhat degenerate -- they don&apos;t have a good reason to <em>trust</em> that their belief is true, and so we don&apos;t want to worry about them. Since we want to talk about <em>justified</em> belief, let&apos;s consider a property based on which of the two agents <em>we</em> would trust.</p><p>So, for now let&apos;s adopt an informal definition: a program A[C] is universal with respect to some class of programs C if we would trust any beliefs reported by A[C], no matter what beliefs we hear reported by programs in C. (I&apos;ll talk about the specific notion of &quot;ascription universality&quot; later.) Notably, we need to trust A[C] even over our own beliefs, that is, if A[C] believes something, we discard our position and adopt A[C]&apos;s belief.</p><p>Note that this is still a very strong criterion. Consider the question of whether AI will lead to x-risk: if one agent thinks about fixed-point theorems, while another studies neural nets, and a third tries to predict the response of democratic institutions, the agent A[C] must compete with <em>everything</em> that these agents (justifiably) conclude. For now, let&apos;s set aside the question of how to build a universal agent, and instead understand what it enables us to do.</p><p><u><a href=""https://ai-alignment.com/informed-oversight-18fcb5d3d1e1"">Informed oversight (revisited)</a></u> <em>(Paul Christiano)</em> (summarized by Rohin): Introduced in <u><a href=""https://ai-alignment.com/the-informed-oversight-problem-1b51b4f66b35"">this older post</a></u>, we consider a setting in which an overseer is training an agent, and the overseer is smarter than the agent. Intuitively, this should work out well, because if the agent ever tries to do something bad, the overseer should notice this (since it is smarter), and penalize it. However, the problem is that the agent might <em>in the course of computing an answer</em> come up with considerations that the overseer can&apos;t easily find. For example, an agent tasked with creating novel literature might end up plagiarizing from one book; the overseer may not be able to search through all the books to detect the plagiarism. However, if the overseer is universal, then it should also know that the agent&apos;s output is plagiarized from the book (because the agent knows that), and it can penalize it appropriately.</p><p>We can even construct a semi-formal argument (see the post for the math). Let us assume that there is some true utility function U, and when the agent takes some action a, the overseer provides it with reward r = E[U(a)], where the expectation is relative to the overseer&apos;s beliefs. Let us assume away problems of distribution shift: in particular, we&apos;ll assume that when choosing between actions a1 and a2, the agent always chooses the action with higher reward. Now suppose that the agent chooses action a1. We can conclude that a1 has higher reward than a2. This means that the observer believes that a1 has higher true utility than a2. But by universality, we always trust the observer over the agent and ourselves, and so we must also believe that a1 has higher true utility than a2, which means that we believe the agent is choosing the right action.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> This application of universality is the one I believe the most; even intuitively it seems like the entire informed oversight problem is that the overseer <em>doesn&apos;t</em> know everything that the agent knows, and universality straightforwardly fixes that. So I see this as the motivating example for caring about universality at all.</p><p><u><a href=""https://ai-alignment.com/training-robust-corrigibility-ce0e0a3b9b4d"">Worst-case guarantees (Revisited)</a></u> <em>(Paul Christiano)</em> (summarized by Rohin): Let&apos;s start considering distribution shift again: we imagine that the agent has already been trained, and there is no overseer any more. When the agent goes off distribution, it may not choose the action that would have gotten the highest reward, and in fact it could be chosen maliciously. As a silly motivating example, perhaps the agent learned the policy &quot;behave well until I see that RSA-2048 (a product of two very large primes) has been factored&quot;; such a policy will behave perfectly during training but will probably commit a treacherous turn eventually.</p><p>In this setting, we would like to have a worst-case guarantee, that the model will never behave unacceptably. However, we need to enforce this guarantee at training time, <em>before</em> we know what situations will arise at test time. Universality of the overseer isn&apos;t enough to guarantee this, because universality only means that the overseer knows what the agent <em>currently</em> knows; the agent can&apos;t really be said to &quot;know&quot; that it will deceive us in the future.</p><p>Nonetheless, it seems like the solution is very related to universality, in that we would like to &quot;peer inside&quot; the agent to figure out how it works, to make sure there aren&apos;t situations in which it would behave unacceptably. We could use adversarial training for this purpose: train an adversary to find inputs on which the model behaves unacceptably, and then train the model on those inputs to not do that. This will require interpretability techniques, so that the adversary actually stands a chance of finding the relevant inputs. In order to handle cases like RSA-2048 above, the adversary should also be able to provide &quot;pseudo-inputs&quot; like &quot;the world in which the agent sees that RSA-2048 is factored&quot; (otherwise the adversary would have to factor RSA-2048 itself to demonstrate an input on which the agent would fail, which is far too difficult), while not being allowed to provide pseudo-inputs like &quot;the world in which the agent kills all humans&quot; (which no agent can behave acceptably on). Ultimately, we need to make sure the adversary will always be able to find a bad pseudo-input if one exists, without making it too difficult for the agent to behave acceptably on all pseudo-inputs.

I&apos;m significantly more optimistic after reading this post, mainly because a couple of previous confusions have been resolved:</p><p>1. The point of verification is not that we can prove a theorem saying &quot;this agent is beneficial&quot;; the point is that by making <em>relaxations</em> (pseudo-inputs), a technique commonly used in formal verification, we can reduce the burden on the other methods being used (such as adversarial training).</p><p>2. Similarly, the point of interpretability is not to help <em>us</em> understand what the agent is doing or will do, it&apos;s to help the <em>overseer</em> (or adversary in adversarial training) understand that. Unlike us, the overseer / adversary can scale up along with the agent itself.</p><p>I still think that it would be hard to get a guarantee with adversarial training, given that adversarial training has to eliminate <em>all</em> vulnerabilities. On the other hand, it only has to find all of the settings where the agent is <em>maliciously optimizing against us</em>, which you might hope is a more natural category that is easier to identify without looking too much at particular inputs. This seems like an empirical question on which we&apos;ll hopefully get data, though even if it works in all cases that we see, that doesn&apos;t rule out the possibility that we failed to notice some issue that will only be triggered in the future (as in the RSA-2048 example).</p><p><u><a href=""https://ai-alignment.com/universality-and-model-based-rl-b08701394ddd"">Universality and model-based RL</a></u> <em>(Paul Christiano)</em> (summarized by Rohin): So far, we&apos;ve been talking about the model-free setting, where the overseer provides the incentives. What about model-based RL? Here, we might want to learn separate distributions over models and utility functions using iterated amplification or HCH, and then plan using any off-the-shelf algorithm, such as MCTS. The first new problem that arises is that our distribution over models may be malicious (see <u><a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1263"">benign induction</a></u>). Using universality, we can solve this problem in two different ways. First, we could use HCH to filter out malicious models. By universality, since a malicious model knows what its goals are, so does HCH, and thus HCH will detect it. Second, we could ask HCH to give us a good prior over models. By universality, this prior over models must be better than the prior used by the malicious models, and so the malicious models&apos; predictions will be worse than that of HCH as a whole, and so the malicious models will not be able to affect the computation much.</p><p>The second new problem in the model-based setting is that it isn&apos;t clear how our utility function can extract all the relevant information from the model. For example, if the model is a detailed simulation of physics, how do you find the &quot;humans&quot; and evaluate how &quot;happy&quot; they are? Universality is at least necessary for this: if there are facts the model &quot;knows&quot;, those facts may be relevant to the utility calculation, and so the utility function also needs to know them. We might hope that universality is sufficient: in the previous case, we might think that the physics simulation &quot;knows&quot; whether humans are happy. But this depends on details of what &quot;know&quot; means that haven&apos;t yet been fleshed out, and it depends on what &quot;kind&quot; of universality we can achieve in practice.</p><p><u><a href=""https://ai-alignment.com/universality-and-consequentialism-within-hch-c0bee00365bd"">Universality and consequentialism within HCH</a></u> <em>(Paul Christiano)</em> (summarized by Rohin): In all the settings discussed so far, we hope to use <u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/NXqs4nYXaq8q6dTTx/humans-consulting-hch"">HCH</a></u> (<u><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/f1947668b183/alignment-newsletter-34"">AN #34</a></u>). What if HCH itself contains malicious optimization? Specifically, recall that HCH involves an arbitrarily large tree of humans breaking questions down into subquestions. Memetic selection on 10^100 humans should be <em>much</em> stronger than the selection done by evolution to produce us, and so could be quite dangerous. We would like to use HCH to check whether its own computations are malicious.</p><p>So, we&apos;ll define a pair of mutually recursive functions, Filter and Filtered-HCH. Filter takes as input a transcript from HCH, and using filtered-HCH it finds the best argument suggesting that the transcript is problematic. It then uses filtered-HCH to ask whether, in light of this argument, the transcript should be treated as problematic. This check is repeated thrice for robustness. (Note that the original HCH treats the transcript as trusted computations, while the checker treats it as an untrusted input.) Filtered-HCH has the same type signature as HCH (i.e. it produces answers to questions). Just like HCH, it computes an answer to the question, with the help of recursive calls to filtered-HCH to get answers to subquestions. Instead of returning the answer directly, it calls Filter to check that the computation done was problematic, and returns the special symbol &#x27C2; instead of the answer if so.</p><p>The basic hope is that if there&apos;s some malicious subcomputation implemented &quot;on top of&quot; the base agents in HCH, and it tries to break HCH, then it &quot;knows&quot; why that attempt could work, and so if filtered-HCH is universal with respect to computations that can be instantiated by (smaller versions of) HCH, then filtered-HCH will also &quot;know&quot; that the computation could break HCH, and will censor it as a result. Consider the threat model from <u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/6fMvGoyy3kgnonRNM/reliability-amplification"">Reliability amplification</a></u> (<u><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/6bfac400a0c3/alignment-newsletter-44"">AN #44</a></u>), where the chance of any particular HCH computation with budget n becoming malicious is &#x3B5;, independent of the input or any past HCH calls. Then, intuitively, filtered-HCH (which needs a higher budget, say kn) has a k&#x3B5; chance of becoming malicious, but since the check is repeated three times and a majority vote is taken, the chance of a malicious computation getting through is k^2&#x3B5;^2, which will be much smaller than the original &#x3B5; if k^2 &#x3B5; &lt;&lt; 1. (This is significantly better than the scheme in <u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/6fMvGoyy3kgnonRNM/reliability-amplification"">Reliability amplification</a></u> (<u><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/6bfac400a0c3/alignment-newsletter-44"">AN #44</a></u>), because the question &quot;is there a problem?&quot; is a binary yes/no question, and so majority vote works a lot better.) The harder case is when specific inputs cause very high probabilities of failure (which I believe is the threat model from <u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/hjEaZgyQ2iprDhkg8/security-amplification"">Security amplification</a></u> (<u><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/35b451cb4d70/alignment-newsletter-45"">AN #45</a></u>)). I particularly don&apos;t understand this section, but I believe the hope is that since the malicious computation is implemented &quot;on top of&quot; the (aligned) humans, only a small &quot;part&quot; of the computation can be malicious, and this can be detected by a <em>small</em> instance of Filtered-HCH on which the malicious computation cannot be implemented.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> I don&apos;t understand this post that well, so I&apos;ll refrain from opining on it. I think I would benefit from a more concrete example of how malicious optimization could be implemented &quot;on top of&quot; HCH, even when the humans are restricted to a small set of inputs on which they are &quot;secure&quot;.</p><p><u><a href=""https://ai-alignment.com/towards-formalizing-universality-409ab893a456"">Towards formalizing universality</a></u> <em>(Paul Christiano)</em> (summarized by Rohin): We&apos;ve now seen a bunch of applications of universality. So what is <em>ascription</em> universality? It&apos;s a specific formalization of the concept of universality. Recall our informal definition so far: a program A[C] is universal with respect to some class of programs C if we would trust any beliefs reported by A[C], no matter what beliefs we hear reported by programs in C. But how can a program &quot;report beliefs&quot;? For HCH, to find out its belief for some question, we simply ask HCH the question and take its answer as its &quot;belief&quot;. However, we can&apos;t do this for arbitrary computations: in particular, if our agent is deliberately hiding a belief from us (and so wouldn&apos;t report it if asked), we shouldn&apos;t simply say that it doesn&apos;t have that belief. This is where <em>ascriptions</em> come in: an ascription is any way of ascribing beliefs to the agent. Simply asking the agent and trusting its answer is one possible ascription. Another class of ascriptions would look at the agent&apos;s code and memory, and make inferences about the agent&apos;s beliefs from that. We want to say that HCH will dominate <em>any</em> &quot;reasonable&quot; ascription of beliefs to the agent, where an ascription procedure is &quot;reasonable&quot; if it isn&apos;t &quot;doing the hard work&quot;; for example, if an agent always says &quot;Yes&quot;, it is unreasonable to ascribe to it the belief that Fermat&apos;s Last Theorem is true (even though when given the question &quot;Is Fermat&apos;s Last Theorem true&quot; it answers yes).</p><p>Putting it all together, A[C] is <em>ascription universal</em> with respect to some class of programs C if, for every &quot;reasonable&quot; ascription procedure and program c in C, A[C]&apos;s beliefs (which we find by asking it) <em>epistemically dominate</em> the beliefs ascribed to c. A set of beliefs B1 <em>epistemically dominates</em> another set of beliefs B2 <em>from our perspective</em> if, given arbitrary information about B1 and B2, for every question our best guess at the answer is what we expect B1 would answer.</p><p>So far we&apos;ve been talking about A[C] dominating an entire class of programs C. We might call this <em>idealized</em> ascription universality, and hope that it applies to systems with perfect optimization, such as <u><a href=""https://blog.openai.com/debate/"">debate</a></u> (<u><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/0ae5d69de63b/alignment-newsletter-5"">AN #5</a></u>) under optimal play. In practice, we&apos;ll never get perfect optimization, and our overseer isn&apos;t going to be able to think of <em>everything</em> that any agent could be thinking about. Instead, we could aim for <em>practical</em> ascription universality, in which A[c] dominates a particular computation c, and it gets to look at the computation c as a hint. This would allow an overseer to train an agent, while epistemically dominating that agent. Effectively we&apos;re asking two questions: first, would our procedure be universal if the optimization was performed perfectly? Second, is weight sharing / interpretability strong enough to solve the optimization problems needed for universality?</p><p>The blog post also has some informal thoughts on why we should expect that a careful Bayesian should be able to epistemically dominate computations found via machine learning (which is why we might hope that HCH could be ascription universal).</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> I was initially a bit confused by the decomposition into the idealized and the practical variant, but I think it makes more sense now: the assumption of <em>perfect</em> optimization gives you a lot of mileage. For example, A[C] might choose a particular computation c in C, and then use its beliefs; if that <em>choice of computation</em> were already &quot;perfectly optimized&quot; for convincing us, then we would always be at least as convinced of A[C]&apos;s answer as the answer of any other c in C. Debate under optimal play is pretty similar: under optimal play, the agent only tells us about the most important considerations, and only brings up other considerations if its opponent asks about them; you would hope that this is like selecting the best c in C and reporting its reasons for its beliefs.</p><p>What&apos;s happening here is that the perfect optimization allows us to select the best c in C, or the best argument, etc. &quot;for free&quot; (i.e. without using any computation), giving us huge savings; everything else just has to present the results properly. Consider again the question of whether AI will lead to x-risk: while there are different agents thinking about fixed-point theorems, neural nets, and democratic institutions, perfect optimization lets us &quot;pick&quot; the agent whose arguments are most important. Then, we should only need about as much computation as the agent itself.</p><p>However, &quot;presenting the results properly&quot; is non-trivial: A[C] needs to report the beliefs <em>in plain English</em>, even if the computation c in C has its beliefs &quot;encoded&quot; (as in the case of a detailed physics simulation that can be said to &quot;know&quot; that humans are happy, but doesn&apos;t say that in plain English). It&apos;s not clear to me whether this will work out.</p><p>You might very reasonably be worried that perfect optimization of &quot;the most convincing argument&quot; will get you something that is convincing for the wrong reasons, and is not actually correlated with the truth. The definition of universality doesn&apos;t preclude this: it simply says that we trust A[C]&apos;s beliefs over our own beliefs and any other agent&apos;s beliefs; this does hold for convincing but invalid arguments. I believe (but am not sure) that the hope is to deal with this by restricting inputs to the human to a small secure space, and by the techniques discussed above in <u><a href=""https://ai-alignment.com/universality-and-consequentialism-within-hch-c0bee00365bd"">Universality and consequentialism within HCH</a></u>.</p><p><u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/R5Euq7gZgobJi5S25/nuances-with-ascription-universality"">Nuances with ascription universality</a></u> <em>(evhub)</em> (summarized by Rohin): Consider a formalization of honesty / transparency related to ascription universality: a system is honest, if relative to our expectations, its explicitly stated beliefs give us just as much information as any other way of ascribing beliefs to the system. A system that searches for ways to commit a treacherous turn would not be honest, since it would not state that it was performing this search. However, what if this search was &quot;distilled&quot; into the weights of a neural net (akin to a lookup table)? In that case, since we wouldn&apos;t ascribe beliefs to the lookup table, the system could be deemed honest by this criterion. So, what we actually need is for the entire training process to be honest. (A similar critique applies directly to ascription universality.)</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> This is a good point; it shows that you need your overseer to be ascription universal with respect to the entire training process, not just the final agent.</p>",rohinmshah,rohinmshah,Rohin Shah,

Not every middle manager faces the high maze levels described in&nbsp;<i>Moral Mazes,&nbsp;</i>but I am confident that many do.</p><p>How did things get so bad?</p><p>We previously discussed<a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/""> Meditations on Moloch.</a> That has a lot of gear-level analysis of how easy it is for undifferentiated high stakes competition along a single variable to destroy everything of value, and how much worse it is to do all those things at once than would be the sum of their parts.</p><p><a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2019/12/29/perfect-competition/"">Perfect Competition</a> summarized and fleshed out that model so we could work with it, and defined Super-Perfect Competition as perfect competition without free exit, which when that restriction is meaningful results in <i>less than zero </i>economic profits.</p><p><a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2019/12/30/imperfect-competition/"">Imperfect Competition</a> illustrated how different idealized perfect competition is from the conditions we typically experience. Even when we use markets that seem highly competitive. Even in a market used as a canonical example of perfect competition.&nbsp;</p><p>The difference between the situations discussed there, and the situation in Moral Mazes, is that the conditions of super-perfect competition <i>really do </i>apply. The protections against this happening have been stripped away.</p><p>An immoral maze is not as extreme as the imagined possible future em world where <a href=""https://secularsolstice.github.io/Contract_Drafting_Em/gen/"">any simulated human caught doing something suboptimal is erased and replaced.</a> But it is closer than one would first think. In a maze, people can’t yet be copied, but there are lots of aspirants to choose from, and any opportunity to rule one out is pounced upon.</p><p>Sources of positive differentiation between managers are systematically destroyed. As we saw above, managers do not believe they exist. So they don’t matter. This leaves only negative differentiation and selection, plus politics.&nbsp;</p><p>Sources of meaningful object-level concerns and detail, and the relevance of any long term consequences of actions, are stripped away as well. Again, managers do not believe they exist. So they don’t matter.</p><p>This leaves a homogenous product that managers must become, the production of which is subject to perfect competition.&nbsp;</p><p>Then the resulting politics runs amok. The system self-reinforces the reinforcement of conformity with these ideals.</p><p>Let’s go over the details that keep the rest of the world safe from such conditions. The bold terms are copied from the previous post, Imperfect Competition.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>No boss. </strong>Not only is there a boss. There are bosses and underlings as far as the eye can see. Everything is reduced to simple metrics and impressions that can be run up or down the chain. Everyone is judged on everything. Based on how they look and cause others to look, and what it says about the person being judged. There are only better and worse judgments, and ways to get them. Avoiding standing out in a negative way (e.g. ‘a thousand atta boys are wiped out by one oops’) is all that matters. The richness of real situations falls away.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Skin in the game. </strong>Immoral mazes actively fight against anyone having skin in the object-level or long term game. They don’t track or remember anything, deliberately destroying or avoiding records to avoid future scapegoating. That leaves no skin in the real game, only skin in the game of short term appearances and politics, which is what skin in the game is supposed to defend against. Even if the system <i>wanted </i>to preserve skin in the game and distribute it usefully, rather than destroy it, there would be a severe shortage of it. Major corporations are too large and consequences too diffuse. There is not enough potential skin in the game to distribute to dozens of levels of management, even in theory under the best of circumstances, even if the company is fully privately held. Skin in the object level game is restricted to the very top and bottom of the hierarchy, if they use it at all. The CEO and board can own stock or options, and the people directly ‘on the line’ can perhaps be judged on individual performance.</p><p><strong>Products and producers are not homogenized, and information about them is costly.</strong> This is the big one that is easiest to miss or be confused about. It’s hard&nbsp;<i>not</i> to notice that there’s a lot of bosses and a lack of skin in the game. Noticing that managers are effectively homogenized is hard, because they aren’t actually homogenized at all – rather it is the <i>perception </i>that they are, which causes them to act and be treated as if they were. Throughout the process of reaching middle management, aspiring managers become homogenized products, and learn to view themselves and their competition in this fashion, and that within managerial circles this is common knowledge. Any deviations are career suicide and severely punished. The idea that one could be <i>better </i>doesn’t parse – see skills differ, below. There’s also the double-think that if you&nbsp;<i>were&nbsp;</i>somehow meaningfully better, that (through what seems to them like some instinctive but unknown mechanism) likely makes you a threat and means you need to be taken out, or that if you’re better that means they are worse and being worse is death, so again, take you out.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Reputation and experience matter a lot. </strong>Reputation inside a maze boils down to whether someone has negative marks that doom them, and how much momentum their career has, and what kind of political allies they’ve made. Your commitment and time spent are also tracked, but that rapidly ceases to differentiate between any of the survivors. None of that is the kind of reputation that does the work of keeping competition imperfect. Experience beyond generic management experience is not only not considered relevant, it is a liability. It means that you lack career momentum.</p><p><strong>Market information is costly for consumers. </strong>Consumers are the bosses and fellow managers, who already understand the market in question all too well. They have no choice but to learn, even if the cost of doing so is high. The protection from expensive information comes from&nbsp;<i>consumers choosing not to purchase all of it.&nbsp;</i></p><p><strong>Market information is costly for producers. </strong>Producers are <i>also </i>the bosses and fellow managers, since no one is close to the object level. So again, they already understand the market in question all too well. No one who matters lacks market information.</p><p><strong>Skills differ. Complete skill stacks are rare. </strong>It is presumed that once a certain level is reached, everyone has a complete managerial skills stack. Everyone’s skill levels are assumed to be equal, aside from skill in politics. The conventional wisdom claims there is common knowledge that there is a generic ‘ability to run a thing’ skill stack. Everyone who has made it this far has that stack. Skills that aren’t generic or politics are considered to effectively not exist, or to be things you should be delegating regardless. Having them yourself is, as noted above, a liability rather than an asset. So there’s no reason to pick particular managers with <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgmO32IdwuE"">a specific set of skills</a> for particular jobs that require those skills. There’s no way to positively differentiate yourself using your skills.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Unknown unknown information exists and matters. </strong>Managers are presumed to all be the same. There aren’t meaningful unknown unknowns. The products for which they coordinate production have unknown unknowns that will eventually matter <i>to the company. </i>They also have aspects that are hard to measure, or hard for someone outside the department (or anyone other than the manager themselves) to notice at all. But that is all a long term problem, the same way we were concerned with long term nutritional effects or the long term reliability of car models. No one cares if a manager was producing something with such long term issues. By the time they come to light, all association between that manager and the product has been long forgotten. Memories don’t last long enough. If one <i>did&nbsp;</i>notice, a middle manager would primarily consider this <i>praiseworthy,&nbsp;</i>because the person successfully got away with something, unless they had an opportunity to somehow use it against them. Management nirvana is described in Moral Mazes as getting promoted and then blaming your successor for your own “mistakes.” Which, of course, are not mistakes from your perspective. The manager <i>is&nbsp;</i>responsible for making sure things don’t go to hell in an observable way <i>while they are still in charge,</i> which would be really bad and likely end one’s career.</p><p><strong>Fixed costs exist. </strong>Fixed costs matter for proper decision making only when they can be avoided (including the option of avoiding them by avoiding the whole enterprise). Otherwise, the ship has sailed, so they are sunk costs, which don’t count and don’t matter, except insofar as <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/tyMdPwd8x2RygcheE/sunk-cost-fallacy"">sunk cost fallacy</a> is thing in context. If they try to pass those costs along, they just dig the hole deeper. Managers have paid <i>huge</i> fixed costs to become managers. At each step they have invested everything they have in their career trajectory. At many steps, they may regret having started down this path, but don’t realize all they are doing is digging a deeper hole for themselves. Or they realize it, but can’t figure out a way to stop.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Production costs are asymmetric. </strong>There are massive asymmetric <i>sunk </i>costs. Sunk costs don’t count. Everyone has already given everything to be able to produce. Everyone is producing the same thing as a result, with the same marginal costs. Anyone not willing to visibly bear those costs is wiped out for that alone. Effectively, everyone has the same production costs aside from political battles.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Economies of scale exist. </strong>Each manager is only one person. While the companies themselves have economies of scale, the competition between employees has no such concept.</p><p><strong>Producer preferences differ. </strong>Producer preferences (aka employee preferences) in theory still exist, but letting them noticeably impact decisions is fatal. Doing so in secret still means sacrificing position in the game for whatever else you care about. Successful managers learn not to do that.</p><p><strong>Location matters.</strong> Location is expected not to be a limiting factor. If a manager is asked to go manage a plant or office in another state or even abroad, refusing to do is a sign that they are insufficiently committed. They might try to steer decisions a non-zero amount to avoid the costs involved, since those costs do interfere with one’s ability to do the job, but this mostly isn’t a thing. This prevents differentiation based on location, which was how this made the original list, and it also wrecks the lives of the managers involved since they cannot choose where to live or predict where they will be.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Consumers care about the individual producers. </strong>It is considered a grave sin in middle management culture to care about your underlings, also known as your producers. You protect them while they are loyal and competent and not the scapegoat at this time, because that is part of the job. You need to be seen as the type of person who does that. But actually sacrificing value for them would be seen as terribly weak. As you do not care about them, the people above you do not care about you either. Loyalty until such loyalty is no longer useful is a thing, but that is very much not the same thing nor does it fill the same role.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Everyone is judged on a combination of politics, and whether they can properly produce the homogenized product ‘successful middle manager.’ This centrally includes associating only with those also producing such products, rewarding such products, and punishing any deviations from such products. You are responsible for everyone and everything below you, so you must demand fealty from those below you, so they’ll serve whatever agenda is most helpful to you. You must also ensure that they are producing the ‘successful middle manager’ product.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The Opt-Out Clause</p><p>The good news for managers is that once one reaches a certain level, as long as one continues to play by the rules and make others comfortable (comfortable is a key concept we don’t have space to discuss here, for more see section B of <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2019/05/30/quotes-from-moral-mazes/"">Quotes from Moral Mazes</a>), one can typically ride things out while carving out some amount of outside value for yourself. One does this by visibly opting out of the game, and no longer being seen as a threat. <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2019/07/02/everybody-knows/"">Everyone knows</a> that some people must stay in place to keep the wheels mostly turning. Without such people the whole system doesn’t collapse too fast and take current management down. Thus, there is an option for graceful retirement from the climb up the ladder.</p><blockquote><p>More generally, those who accept immobility are unwilling to sacrifice family life or free-time activities to put in the extraordinarily long hours at the office required in the upper circles of their corporations. Or they have made a realistic assessment of the age structure, career paths, and power relationships above them and conclude that there is no longer real opportunity for them. They may see that there is an irreparable mismatch between their own personal styles and the kinds of social skills being cultivated in well-entrenched higher circles. In many cases, they decide that they do not wish to put up with the great stress of higher management work that they have witnessed. (Location 962, Quote 119, Moral Mazes)</p></blockquote><p>Producing ‘successful middle manager’ is largely a pass/fail operation. You can’t produce it by halves. Thus, once you realize you are unable or unwilling to produce it properly, either you move somewhere where you can do so, you quit entirely, or you stop trying to produce ‘successful middle manager’ and instead produce ‘contented middle manager.’ Those are the level one damage mitigation strategies.&nbsp;</p><p>Later sections will deal with such damage mitigation options more broadly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Is This Missing Something?</p><p>On one level, this robustly answers the question “how did things get so bad?”</p><p>On another level, this begs that question entirely. It does not explain why everyone involved ended up with such crazy beliefs, or allowed things to get so bad. It merely explains the bind the players are in within the game as it currently exists.</p><p>There is the implication that the whole thing is wrapped in conspiracy and malice that is left implicit, its motives and modes of operation unclear. Without that element, the explanation feels incomplete at best.</p><p>This gap is because the model only implicitly mentions Moloch’s Army. I still haven’t quite figured out how to take that on, slash we’re not ready yet. Hopefully you now have a better idea of what this represents.</p><p>Mazes Everywhere</p><p>These dynamics don’t only exist in major corporations. By default, at least right here and right now, they arise in <i>any </i>sufficiently large organization. Barring strong optimization pressure holding them back, things over time in any given organization with multiple levels of management will become increasingly maze-like.</p><p>Governments are presumed to be mazes. Armies. Political parties. Unions. Academia. Sufficiently large non-profits are almost certainly mazes – the profit motive is if anything <i>fighting against&nbsp;</i>the property of being a maze. Getting rid of it would only speed things along.</p><p>This is doubly true because mazes do not only support themselves being mazes. They tend to support and encourage maze behaviors in other places and organizations, favoring mazes over non-mazes. Our major corporations have largely been mazes for decades.</p><p>A maze&nbsp;<i>need not even be a formal organization.&nbsp;</i>You can get similar effective behaviors whenever there is an effective multi-level hierarchy.</p><p>Consider Paul Graham and Sam Altman’s description of the ecosystem surrounding Y-Combinator, <a href=""http://benjaminrosshoffman.com/approval-extraction-advertised-as-production/"">as analyzed recently by Ben Hoffman</a>. Or the model of the same system in my older post <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2015/05/15/in-a-world-of-venture-capital/"">In a world… of venture capital</a>, where each round of funding can be considered the boss of the investors in the previous round.</p><p>The Next Questions</p><p>There now exist three categories of next questions.&nbsp;</p><p>The first category (taken from<a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5nH5Qtax9ae8CQjZ9/no-it-s-not-the-incentives-it-s-you#37ngZ75tTR6n6PjnR""> this comment</a> I made on Less Wrong) are the big global questions. To what extent are these dynamics the inevitable result of large organizations? If so, to what extent should we avoid creating large organizations? Has this dynamic ever been different in the past in other places and times, and if so why and can we duplicate those causes?</p><p>The second category are the big personal questions. Given the existence of these immoral mazes, what do I do?&nbsp;</p><p>The third category is the one I’ve been struggling with, which is to finally get a good written model of the dynamics of anti-epistemic anti-virtue.</p></body></html>",Zvi,zvi,Zvi,

<p>This covered a few topics:</p>
<ol>
<li>How we can think about and use Expected Loss to understand and optimize judgemental forecasting setups.</li>
<li>Some thoughts around how (1) applies to our decisions about long-term forecasting.</li>
<li>A few slides on Foretold and how similar systems could be used to help with (1) and (2).</li>

<p>I recently recorded a quick version of this talk on YouTube. As always, I'd be curious to get feedback on these ideas.</p>
<h2>Original Talk Abstract</h2>
<p>The last several decades have brought a large number of contributions to statistical and judgemental forecasting endeavors. The next several decades may bring significantly more.</p>
<p>As things get more advanced, not only will our understanding of how to predict distant events improve, but our understanding of the accuracy of these forecasts will improve as well. This should help us to resolve questions regarding when and how much to trust these forecasts.</p>
<p>This talk will present an overview of what we can expect if things go well and how thinking about this can inform our current actions when optimizing for the long term future.</p>

itGmH2AknmjWyAwj8,(Double-)Inverse Embedded Agency Problem,double-inverse-embedded-agency-problem,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/itGmH2AknmjWyAwj8/double-inverse-embedded-agency-problem,2020-01-08T04:30:24.842Z,27,9,8,False,False,,"<p>MIRI <a href=""https://intelligence.org/embedded-agency/"">has said a lot</a> about the issue of embedded agency over the last year. However, I am yet to see them trying to make progress in what I see as the most promising areas. </p><p>How does one attack a problem that is new, complicated and non-obvious? By <strong>constructing toy models</strong> and <strong>inverting hard questions</strong> to make them more tractable. </p><p>In general an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_problem"">inverse problem</a> is harder than the &quot;direct&quot; one, because we are trying to infer unobservables from observables. Wikipedia gives an example of figuring out the position of Neptune from the perturbations in the orbit of Uranus. Another popular example is NP-complete problems: they are famously hard to solve but it is easy to verify a solution. Another example: you take <strong>a multiple-choice math quiz</strong>, it is often faster and easier to get the right answer by plugging the 4 or 5 potential solutions into the stated problem than to solve the problem directly.</p><p>I&apos;ll give an example from my own area. The equations of <strong>general relativity</strong> are hard to solve except in a few highly symmetric cases. It is a classic inverse problem. But! Any spacetime metric is actually a solution of the Einstein equations, so all one needs to do is to write down a metric and calculate its Einstein tensor to see what kind of a matter distribution (and boundary conditions) it is a solution of. <strong>Inverting the inverse problem!</strong> Of course, life is not that easy. Most solutions correspond to &quot;unphysical&quot; matter, usually with negative energy density, superluminal flows, singularities, infinities, weird topologies etc. However, it is a useful approach if one wants to study some general properties of the equations, and get a feel for (or sometimes a theorem about) what goes wrong, why and how. After a few iterations one can get better at guessing what form a &quot;good&quot; solution might take, and write up an ansatz that can help solve the original, not the inverse problem in some cases.</p><p>Another, more familiar example: <strong>arithmetic division</strong>. Until you learn or figure out the rules, it&apos;s hard. But its inverse problem, multiplication, is actually much easier! So to learn more about division, it pays to try to start with potential solutions and see what kind of multiplication actually solve the division problem. Eventually one can come up with the long division algorithm, that uses nothing but multiplication and subtraction. And voila, inverting an inverse problem helps us solve the original one.</p><p>This approach is common in computer science, as well. Plenty of algorithms, like <strong>search</strong>, actually rely on solving smaller and simpler inverse problems.</p><p>I contend that a similar approach could be useful for making progress in understanding embedded agency. To that end, let&apos;s first restate the original problem of embedded agency (<a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/i3BTagvt3HbPMx6PN/embedded-agency-full-text-version"">copied from the alignment forum page</a>):</p><p><strong>How can one make good models of the world that are able to fit within an agent that is much smaller than the world?</strong></p><p>This is a hard inverse problem! There are many faucets of it, such as the oft-mentioned problem of logical counterfactuals, that do not seem to yield to direct attacks. So, it seem natural to learn to &quot;seek under the light&quot; before stepping into the darkness, and that includes, you guessed it, constructing toy models and inverting the inverse problems.</p><p>What would inverting this problem look like? There are multiple possible formulations, just like an inverse of the operation of power a^b is both n-th root and logarithm. Here is a couple of ideas:</p><ul><li>Create a toy universe and look for its representations inside. </li><li>Create a toy model and construct a world around it such that the model represents the world in some way.</li></ul><p>Here is an example: a <strong>fractal</strong> is self-similar, so any subset of it can be thought of as a near-perfect model of the whole. Of course, a model is not enough, one has to figure out what would constitute an agent using this model in this fractal world. But at least it can be a promising and potentially illuminating direction to explore. There are plenty more ideas one can come up after thinking about it for 5 minutes.</p><p>I hope someone at MIRI is either thinking along these directions, or is ready to try to, instead of being stuck analyzing the messy and complicated inverse problem that is the &quot;real world&quot;.</p><br>",shminux,shmi,Shmi,

If you'd like to read more detailed instructions about how to vote, the rest of the text below contains instructions for how to use the voting system.</p><hr><h2>How To Vote</h2><p><strong>Sorting Posts Into Buckets</strong></p><p>The first part of voting is sorting the nominated posts into buckets.</p><p>The five buckets are: No, Neutral, Good, Important, Crucial. Sort the posts however you think is best.</p><p>The key part is the <i>relative weighting</i> of different posts. For example, it won't make a difference to your final vote if you put every post in 'crucial' or every post in 'good'.</p><p><strong>Fine-Tuning Your Votes</strong></p><p>The system we're using is quadratic voting (as I discussed <a href=""https://lessestwrong.com/posts/qQ7oJwnH9kkmKm2dC/feedback-request-quadratic-voting-for-the-2018-review"">a few weeks ago</a>).</p><p>Once you're happy with your buckets, click 'Convert to Quadratic'. At this point the system converts your buckets roughly into their quadratic equivalents.&nbsp;</p><p>The system will only assign integer numbers of votes, which means that it will likely only allocate around 80-90% of the total votes available to you. If you vote on a smaller number of posts (&lt;10), the automatic system may not use your entire quadratic voting budget.</p><p>If you're happy with how things look, you can just leave at this point, and your votes will be saved (you can come back any time before the vote closes to update them). But if you want to allocate 100% of your available votes, you'll likely need to do fine-tuning.&nbsp;</p><p>There are two key parts of quadratic voting you need to know:</p><ul><li>First, you have a <i>limited budget </i>of votes.</li><li>Second, votes on a post have <i>increasing </i>marginal cost.</li></ul><p>This means that your first vote costs 1 point, your second vote on that post costs 2 points, your third costs 3 points. Your <i>nth</i> vote costs <i>n</i> points.</p><p>You have 500 points to spend. You can see how many points you've spent at the top of the posts.</p><p>The system will automatically weight the buckets differently. For example, I just did this, and I got the following weightings:</p><ul><li>Good: 2 votes.</li><li>Important: 4 votes.</li><li>Crucial: 9 votes.</li><li>Neutral: 0 votes.</li><li>No: -4 votes.</li></ul><p>(Note that negative votes cost the same as positive votes. The first negative vote costs 1 point, the second negative vote costs 2 points, etc.)</p><p>You'll see your score at the top of the page. (When I arrived on the fine-tuning page, the system had spent about 416 points, which meant I had a significant number of votes left to buy.)</p><p>Once you're happy with the balance, just close the page; your votes will be saved.</p><p>You can return to this page anytime until voting is over, to reconfigure your weights.</p><p><strong>Leaving Comments (Anonymous)</strong></p><p>There's a field to leave anonymous thoughts on a post. All comments written here will be put into a public Google doc, and be linked to from the post that announces the result of the vote. If you want to share your thoughts, however briefly, this is a space to do that.&nbsp;</p><p>I will likely be making a book of 2018 posts, and if I do I will use the votes as my guide to what to include, so I'll definitely be interested in reading through people's anonymous thoughts and feelings about the 2018 LW posts.</p><hr><h2>Extra Notes</h2><p><strong>Additional info on voting</strong></p><p>If you'd like to go back to the buckets stage, hit “Return to basic voting”. If you do this, all of your fine-tuning will be thrown out the window, and the system will re-calculate your weights entirely based on the new buckets you assign.</p><p>I find it really valuable to be able to see the posts in the order I've currently ranked them, so there's a button at the top to re-order the posts, which I expect to be clicked dozens of times by each user.</p><p>If you click on a post, all nominations and reviews for that post will appear in a box on the side of the page. You may want to read these to make a more informed decision when voting.</p><p><strong>The results</strong></p><p>The voting will have many outputs. Once we've had the time to analyse the data, we'll include a bunch of data/graphs, all anonymised, such as:</p><ul><li>For each winning post and each bucket, how many times people picked that bucket</li><li>The individual votes each post got</li><li>The results if the karma cutoff was 10,000 karma rather than 1,000</li><li>The output of people's buckets compared with the output of people's quadratic fine-tuning</li><li>The mean and standard deviation of the votes</li></ul><hr><p><a href=""/reviewVoting""><strong>Vote Here (if you have more than 1000 karma)</strong></a></p></body></html>",Benito,benito,Ben Pace,

<p>How can you know I’m talking about morality (<a href=""https://www.britannica.com/story/whats-the-difference-between-morality-and-ethics"">aka</a> ethics), rather than something else, when I say that I “should” do something, that humanity “ought” to take certain actions, or that something is “good”? What are the borderlines and distinctions between morality and the various potential “something else”s? How do they overlap and interrelate?</p>
<p>In this post, I try to collect together and summarise philosophical concepts that are relevant to the above questions.<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-GvoWKDZsimzH8WXsq-1"" id=""fnref-GvoWKDZsimzH8WXsq-1"">[1]</a></sup> I hope this will <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/64FdKLwmea8MCLWkE/the-neglected-virtue-of-scholarship"">benefit readers</a> by introducing them to some thought-clarifying conceptual distinctions they may not have been aware of, as well as terms and links they can use to find more relevant info. In <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/oZsyK4SjnPe6HGia8/moral-uncertainty-vs-related-concepts"">another post</a>, I similarly discuss how <em>moral uncertainty</em> differs from and overlaps with related concepts.</p>
<p><em>Epistemic status: The concepts covered here are broad, fuzzy, and overlap in various ways, making definitions and distinctions between them almost inevitably debatable. Additionally, I’m not an expert in these topics; indeed, I expect many readers to know more than me about at least some of them, and one reason I wrote this was to help me clarify my own understandings. I’d appreciate feedback or comments in relation to any mistakes, poor phrasings, etc. (and just in general!).</em></p>
<p><em>Also note that my intention here is mostly to summarise existing ideas, rather than to provide <strong>original</strong> ideas or analysis.</em></p>
<h1>Normativity</h1>
<p>A <em>normative</em> statement is any statement related to what one <em>should</em> do, what one <em>ought</em> to do, which of two things are <em>better</em>, or similar. “Something is said by philosophers to have ‘normativity’ when it entails that some action, attitude or mental state of some other kind is justified, an action one ought to do or a state one ought to be in” (<a href=""https://www.rep.routledge.com/articles/thematic/normativity/v-1"">Darwall</a>). Normativity is thus the overarching category (<em><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset"">superset</a></em>) of which things like morality, prudence (in the sense explained below), and arguably rationality are just subsets.</p>
<p>This matches the usage of “normative” <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normative_economics"">in economics</a>, where normative claims relate to “what ought to be” (e.g., “The government should increase its spending”), while <em>positive</em> claims relate to “what is” (including predictions, such as what effects an increase in government spending may have). In linguistics, the equivalent distinction is between <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_prescription""><em>prescriptive</em> approaches</a> (involving normative claims about “better” or “correct” uses of language) and <em>descriptive</em> approaches (which are about how language <em>is</em> used).</p>
<h1>Prudence</h1>
<p><em>Prudence</em> essentially refers to the subset of normativity that has to do with <em>one’s own</em> self-interest, happiness, or wellbeing (see <a href=""https://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199657889.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199657889-e-35"">here</a> and <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/reasoning-moral/#HowDistMoraReasPracReasGene"">here</a>). This contrasts with morality, which may include but isn’t limited to one’s self-interest (except perhaps for <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethical_egoism"">egoist</a> moral theories).</p>
<p>For example (based on <a href=""http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/MacAskill-Normative-Uncertainty.pdf"">MacAskill</a> p. 41), we may have <em>moral</em> <em>reasons</em> to give money to GiveWell-recommended charities, but <em>prudential</em> <em>reasons</em> to spend the money on ourselves, and both sets of reasons are “normatively relevant” considerations.</p>
<p><em>(The rest of this section is my own analysis, and may be mistaken.)</em></p>
<p>I would expect that the significance of prudential reasons, and how they relate to moral reasons, would differ depending on the moral theories one is considering (e.g., depending on which moral theories one has some belief in). Considering moral and prudential reasons separately <em>does</em> seem to make sense in relation to moral theories that don’t <em>precisely</em> mandate <em>specific</em> behaviours; for example, moral theories that simply forbid certain behaviours (e.g., violating people’s rights) while otherwise letting one choose from a range of options (e.g., donating to charity or not).<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-GvoWKDZsimzH8WXsq-2"" id=""fnref-GvoWKDZsimzH8WXsq-2"">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>In contrast, “maximising” moral theories like classical utilitarianism claim that the <em>only</em> action one is permitted to take is the <em>very best</em> action, leaving no room for choosing the “prudentially best” action out of a range of “morally acceptable” actions. Thus, in relation to maximising theories, it seems like keeping track of prudential reasons in addition to moral reasons, and sometimes acting based on prudential rather than moral reasons, would mean that one is effectively either:</p>
<ul>
<li>using a modified version of the maximising moral theory (rather than the theory itself), or</li>
<li><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/dX7vNKg4vex5vxWCW/making-decisions-under-moral-uncertainty-1"">acting as if “morally uncertain”</a> between the maximising moral theory and a “moral theory” in which prudence is seen as “intrinsically valuable”.</li>
</ul>
<p>Either way, the boundary between prudence and morality seems to become fuzzier or less meaningful in such cases.<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-GvoWKDZsimzH8WXsq-3"" id=""fnref-GvoWKDZsimzH8WXsq-3"">[3]</a></sup></p>
<h1>(Instrumental) Rationality</h1>
<p><em>(This section is sort-of my own analysis, and may be mistaken or use terms in unusual ways.)</em></p>
<p><a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/phc3.12408"">Bykvist (2017)</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rationality, in one important sense at least, has to do with what one should do or intend, given one’s beliefs and preferences. This is the kind of rationality that decision theory often is seen as invoking. It can be spelled out in different ways. One is to see it as a matter of coherence: It is rational to do or intend what coheres with one’s beliefs and preferences (Broome, 2013; for a critic, see Arpaly, 2000).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Using this definition, it seems to me that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rationality can be considered a subset of normativity in which the “should” statements, “ought” statements, etc. follow in a systematic way from one’s beliefs and preferences.</li>
<li>Whether a “should” statement, “ought” statement, etc. is rational is unrelated to the balance of moral or prudential reasons involved. E.g., what I “rationally should” do relates only to morality and not prudence if <em>my</em> <em>preferences</em> relate only to morality and not prudence, and vice versa. (And situations in between those extremes are also possible, of course).<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-GvoWKDZsimzH8WXsq-4"" id=""fnref-GvoWKDZsimzH8WXsq-4"">[4]</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>For example, the statement “Rationally speaking, I should buy a Ferrari” is true if (a) I believe that doing so will result in me possessing a Ferrari, and (b) I value that outcome more than I value continuing to have that money. And it doesn’t matter whether the <em>reason</em> I value that outcome is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prudential: based on self-interest;</li>
<li>Moral: e.g., I’m a utilitarian who believes that the best way I can use my money to increase universe-wide utility is to buy myself a Ferrari (perhaps it looks <em>really</em> red and shiny and my <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-serving_bias"">biases are self-serving</a> the hell out of me);</li>
<li>Some mixture of the two.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Epistemic rationality</h2>
<p>Note that that discussion focused on <em>instrumental</em> rationality, but the same basic points could be made in relation to <em>epistemic</em> rationality, given that epistemic rationality itself “can be seen as a form of instrumental rationality in which knowledge and truth are goals in themselves” (<a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Rationality"">LW Wiki</a>).</p>
<p>For example, I could say that, from the perspective of epistemic rationality, I “shouldn’t” believe that buying that Ferrari will create more utility in expectation than donating the same money to AMF would. This is because holding that belief won’t help me meet the goal of having accurate beliefs.</p>
<p>Whether and how this relates to morality would depend on whether the “deeper reasons” why I prefer to have accurate beliefs (assuming I do indeed have that preference) are prudential, moral, or mixed.<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-GvoWKDZsimzH8WXsq-5"" id=""fnref-GvoWKDZsimzH8WXsq-5"">[5]</a></sup></p>
<h1>Subjective vs objective</h1>
<p><em>Subjective</em> normativity relates to what one should do <em>based on what one believes</em>, whereas <em>objective</em> normativity relates to what one “actually” should do (i.e., based on the true state of affairs). <a href=""https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/Greaves_Cotton-Barratt_bargaining_theoretic_approach.pdf"">Greaves and Cotton-Barratt</a> illustrate this distinction with the following example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Suppose Alice packs the waterproofs but, as the day turns out, it does not rain. Does it follow that Alice made the wrong decision? In one (objective) sense of “wrong”, yes: thanks to that decision, she experienced the mild but unnecessary inconvenience of carrying bulky raingear around all day. But in a second (more subjective) sense, clearly it need not follow that the decision was wrong: if the probability of rain was sufficiently high and Alice sufficiently dislikes getting wet, her decision could easily be the appropriate one to make given her state of ignorance about how the weather would in fact turn out. Normative theories of decision-making under uncertainty aim to capture this second, more subjective, type of evaluation; the standard such account is expected utility theory.<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-GvoWKDZsimzH8WXsq-6"" id=""fnref-GvoWKDZsimzH8WXsq-6"">[6]</a></sup><sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-GvoWKDZsimzH8WXsq-7"" id=""fnref-GvoWKDZsimzH8WXsq-7"">[7]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This distinction can be applied to each subtype of normativity (i.e., morality, prudence, etc.).</p>
<p><em>(I discuss this distinction further in my post <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/oZsyK4SjnPe6HGia8/moral-uncertainty-vs-related-concepts"">Moral uncertainty vs related concepts</a>.)</em></p>
<h1>Axiology</h1>
<p>The term <em>axiology</em> is used in different ways in different ways, but the definition we’ll focus on here is from the <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/value-theory/"">Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Traditional axiology seeks to investigate what things are good, how good they are, and how their goodness is related to one another. Whatever we take the “primary bearers” of value to be, one of the central questions of traditional axiology is that of what stuffs are good: what is of value.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same article also states: “For instance, a traditional question of axiology concerns whether the objects of value are subjective psychological states, or objective states of the world.”</p>
<p>Axiology (in this sense) is essentially one aspect of morality/ethics. For example, classical utilitarianism combines:</p>
<ul>
<li>the principle that one must take actions which will lead to the outcome with the <em>highest possible level of value</em>, rather than just doing things that lead to “good enough” outcomes, or just avoiding violating people’s rights</li>
<li>the axiology that “well-being” is what has intrinsic value</li>
</ul>
<p>The axiology itself is not a moral theory, but plays a key role in that moral theory.</p>
<p>Thus, one can’t have an axiological “should” statement, but one’s axiology may <em>influence/inform</em> one’s moral “should” statements.</p>
<h1>Decision theory</h1>
<p><em>(This section is sort-of my own commentary, may be mistaken, and may accidentally deviate from standard uses of terms.)</em></p>
<p>It seems to me that the way to fit decision theories into this picture is to say that one must <em>add</em> a decision theory to one of the “sources of normativity” listed above (e.g., morality) in order to get some form of normative (e.g., moral) statements. However, a decision theory can’t “generate” a normative statement by itself.</p>
<p>For example, suppose that I have a moral preference for having more money rather than less, all other things held constant (because I wish to donate it to cost-effective causes). By itself, this can’t tell me whether I “should” one-box or two-box in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcomb's_paradox"">Newcomb’s problem</a>. But once I specify my decision theory, I can say whether I “should” one-box or two-box. E.g., if I’m a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_decision_theory"">causal decision theorist</a>, I “should” two-box.</p>
<p>But if I knew <em>only</em> that I was a causal decision theorist, it would still be possible that I “should” one-box, if for some reason I preferred to have less money. Thus, as stated, we must specify (or assume) <em>both</em> a set of preferences <em>and</em> a decision theory in order to arrive at normative statements.</p>
<h1>Metaethics</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>While normative ethics addresses such questions as ""What should I do?"", evaluating specific practices and principles of action, meta-ethics addresses questions such as ""What is goodness?"" and ""How can we tell what <em>is</em> good from what is bad?"", seeking to understand the nature of ethical properties and evaluations. (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-ethics"">Wikipedia</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, metaethics is not <em>directly</em> normative at all; it isn’t about <em>making</em> “should”, “ought”, “better than”, or similar statements. Instead, it’s about understanding the “nature” of (the moral subset of) such statements, “where they come from”, and other such fun/spooky/nonsense/incredibly important matters.</p>
<h1>Metanormativity</h1>
<p><em>Metanormativity</em> relates to the “norms that govern how one ought to act that take into account one’s fundamental normative uncertainty”. Normative uncertainty, in turn, is essentially a generalisation of moral uncertainty that can also account for (uncertainty about) prudential reasons. I will thus discuss the topic of metanormativity in my next post, on <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/oZsyK4SjnPe6HGia8/moral-uncertainty-vs-related-concepts"">Moral uncertainty vs related concepts</a>.</p>
<p><em>As stated earlier, I hope this usefully added to/clarified the concepts in your mental toolkit, and I’d welcome any feedback or comments!</em></p>
<p><em>(In particular, if you think there’s another concept whose overlaps with/distinctions from “morality” are worth highlighting, either let me know to add it, or just go ahead and explain it in the comments yourself.)</em></p>

<li>Why and how I applied to MIRI and failed to secure an internship.</li>
<li>My experience at the <a href=""https://intelligence.org/ai-risk-for-computer-scientists/"">AI Risk for Computer Scientists</a> workshop (AIRCS).</li>

<p>If you're only interested in the AIRCS workshop, you may skip to the <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/EYhWxoaCK2YSpTei9/aircs-workshop-how-i-failed-to-be-recruited-at-miri#AIRCS"">second section</a> directly. Ideally, I'd have liked to make two separate entries, as they may pertain to different points of interest. However, both topics are extremely intertwined to me, and I could not make a clear cut in this experience. I should also note that me failing to secure an internship at MIRI probably have had a drastic impact in how I write about it, if only because I'd have been more constrained in what I describe had I got the internship.</p>

<h1>Miri and me.</h1>
<p>I discovered MIRI through Eliezer Yudkowsky, as I first began reading HPMOR and then Rationality, from A.I. to Zombie. Like almost everyone, I'm not sure what it is MIRI exactly do. I know at least that MIRI's intended goal is to save the world from unaligned AGI. But whatever it is they concretely do, it seems quite fun - I mean, it seems to involve type theory and category theory. I also read some articles they wrote, and skimmed through many other. While interesting, I've never caught enough details to actually imagine how to even start implementing anything they speak of. Reading some of their writings reminded me of several epistemology books I read years ago, but written more precisely, with clear code in mind, and to a computer-science-savy audience.</p>
<p>As I said, fun stuff, fun work!</p>
<p>In February 2019, Eliezer Yudkowsky shared on <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/bshlgrs/posts/10215867821943197"">facebook</a> a post by Buck Schlegeris stating that ""I think that every EA who is a software engineer should apply to work at MIRI, if you can imagine wanting to work at MIRI."" (and some more stuff). When I read that, I thought I should give it at least a try. I really didn't know how I could have helped them given my professional background - mostly logic and automata theory - but if they say that we should give it a try anyway, let's. I must admit that I was still skeptical back then, and didn't know exactly what they do, but I thought I would eventually come to get it. And even if it did not seem that they'll save the world from anything in the end(1), it still seemed a place I'd have loved to work at, assuming they are similar to the less wrongers I met at the european LessWrong community week-end.</p>
<p>Note that Buck Schlegeris's message does not directly concerns me. I'm not EA, but only EA adjacent. I still fail to see any effective actions I could take appart from giving some money, and when I applied for <a href=""https://80000hours.org/coaching/"">80k career coaching</a>, they told me they couldn't help(2). It also does not concern me because I used to be a post doc researcher who sometimes programmed, and not a software engineer in itself. But I wanted to let them decide wether I'd be a good fit or not.</p>
<p>The application process went as follows: First it started off with a triplebyte quizz. This one was extremely easy. I think there was at most two questions which answers I didn't know. The second part was two one hour calls with a MIRI researcher. The first call was a general presentation of myself, how I've heard of MIRI, why I am interested in working there, what were my past experiences, and so on. I told the interviewer something such as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am not even convinced that MIRI's work is important. At best, I am convinced that you were convinced that it is important. But even if EY is a good writer who I admire, the fact that he his set on the importance of his mission is not sufficient for me to think he is right. Furthermore, MIRI gets money by convincing people that their work is important, which means that MIRI has a strong incentive to be persuasive, whether or not your beliefs are true, and whether or not you still hold that belief. I do believe that when MIRI was created, it was not clear they would ever get money. If EY is as good as he seems to be when he writes, he could probably have cashed money in in far easier ways. So the best argument I have currently regarding AGI alignment's importance is that the founders of MIRI thought it was important at the time of MIRI's creation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Honestly, after saying all of this, I thought my application was over and we would have stopped there, but it seemed okay with him. The second interview was more technical, the interviewer asked me plenty of questions on various topics pertaining to computer science, programming and theory. He also gave me a short programming exercice, which I succeeded (I won't tell you what the questions and exercice were for obvious reasons). I should emphasize that my answers were far from being perfect. When discussing with friends I learned that I had got some answers wrong; I had questions related to the Coq language for instance, I gave the closest answer I knew, which was haskell/ocaml related while Coq's construction was greatly generalized as far as I understand it(3). One question asked me how I would create a data structure allowing to have an efficient access to some functions. I gave a correct answer, I knew that the worst time complexity was logarithmic, but was not able to prove it. After the interview, I did realize that actually the proof was extremely easy.</p>
<p>The interviewer told me that, before taking a decision, MIRI wanted to meet me at a workshop, so they invited me to AIRCS, and that they also wanted me to take a 2 day long programming test. I still don't understand that: what's the point of inviting me if the test fails ? It would appear more cost efficient to wait until after the test to decide whether they want me to come or not (I don't think I ever asked it out loud, I was already happy to have a trip to California for free). I want to emphasize that at this point, I still had no idea of why they had found my application interesting, and what I would actually do if I worked for them. I kind of hoped that I'd get an answer eventually. I was noticing my confusion, as a good rationalist should do. Alas, as always when I notice my confusion, I stay confused and can't figure out what to do with it.</p>
<p>Last part of the interview was a two day long programming problem. There was a main programming task, with two options, I did only one of them. I mean, the second one seems way more interesting, but with my knowledge today, I fear that I would have needed a week to really read enough and implement it correctly. As I told my interviewer, it relates to a topic I do not know well. There was one thing which I had particularly appreciated: I was being paid for the whole time doing this programming exercice for them. This is a practice I've never seen elsewhere. I do not wish to disclose how much I have been paid, but I'll state that two hours at that rate was more than a day at the French PhD rate. I didn't even ask to be paid; I hadn't even thought that being paid for a job interview was possible. The task had to be done in 14 hours, i.e. after 2 days of 7 hours work each. I did not know if that rate also applied to me being an intern, but that salary was nice regardless, especially since they'd paid very quickly - it takes three months for every payment back in France(4).  As a quick note here: thank you to everyone who gave at MIRI :p.</p>
<p>Since it seemed that MIRI was actually interested in my application, I believed that I should read more about MIRI. I was mostly reading what MIRI wrote, but to have an informed opinion, I thought I should read what other people wrote about it. Sometimes, EY made fun of the sneer club on twitter. I also saw a copy of an email sent to a lot of people related to CFAR about some creepy stuff that allegedly occurred at MIRI/CFAR. I wanted to get an idea of what I was getting myself into, so I started to browse through all of it. My inner Slytherin argues that the sneer club is filled with rationalists who posts non important stuff so that the actual important stuff get lost in the middle of everything else. I'm not going to write down everything I've read, but let me write a few examples as to explain of why I still went through with the application process. I've read that MIRI's work is not important, this one I might agree with but if I'm getting paid and there is only a one percent chance the work is important, that's still far better than most other job I can find now. Miri is male-dominated... well; according to their ""team"" page, it's hard to argue with this one too, however, given that I'm looking for a job as a computer programmer, I fear that's a problem I'll have everywhere.  ""At a MIRI's workshop, some guy touched a woman without her consent, and did it again after she asked him to stop and he was banned for this"". I do not want to belittle the importance of sexual assault, but if MIRI's reaction was to ban him, I guess that's better than most conference I've heard of. I have no more details, so I don't know how easy it was to report the assault to staff, but I assume that if there were any problem here, the author would have wrote it. I also read that some people have mentioned the idea that infohazard could be used to blackmail people. I kind of assume that less wrong/rationality groups is the best place for this kind of scams, but I'm still okay with this, especially since I have not heard of people actually implementing the idea.</p>
<p>Long story short: I can understand why LW/MIRI sounds like a cult (after all, they ask for money to save the world). But since I was actually being offered things by them and obtained the best wage I ever had for the working test, it was hard to be frightened by this cult-idea. I did some time spent money which were related to LW. But nothing seems to be a sloppery slope. I meant, I paid for EY's book, but I paid far more for the entire Tolkien/Pratchett/Gaimann/Asimov... collection, and no one ever told me they were cults. I also sent a few hundreds euros to Berlin's LW community, but for this price, I did have 3 nights at an hostel, and 4 days of food. That seems quite reasonable so I highly doubt there are making huge profits on it.</p>
<p>Let's now skip a whole month and go to AIRCS.</p>
<h1>AIRCS</h1>
<p>Before discussing AIRCS, I want to stress this is a personal view, which may not represent the way anyone else felt about AIRCS. In particular, the fact that, after meeting me at AIRCS, I received an email telling me I won't have an internship at MIRI have probably affected my views. At least because I would probably have been more MIRI aligned if I was actually at MIRI nowadays. I tried to write as much as possible before receiving MIRI's answer to remain as ""objective"" as possible, however they were quite quick to answer, and I'm a slow writer.  And anyway, as you'll see below, the simple fact that I was at AIRCS to help them decide whether they hire me or not meant that my experience was distinct from the others'.</p>
<p>Now that this is written down, I can begin to describe AIRCS.</p>
<h2>Normal life</h2>
<p>Before going into activities in the workshop's planning, I'm going to speak of the workshop generally. After all, the workshop was 5 night and 4 day long, so of course we've spent times doing other stuff. Usually, there were 1h10 long activities separated by 20 minutes breaks, while lunch and dinner breaks were longer. The last night was an ""after party"" instead of workshops, and we had two breakout sessions prior. In those, people were free to offer whatever they wanted. There was a lecture about category theory and quantum circuits if I remember correctly. There was some coding in Haskell. I said I would gladly do an introduction to Anki, but no one found this more interesting than the other stuff - This still led to some anki-related questions later by some participants. During some breaks, there were ""two minutes clean up"", where everyone were cleaning whatever they saw near them. Usually, the clean up were announced in the main room, which means that people far from it didn't hear it and so didn't clean what was near them. Since most of the disorder was actually in the main room that was not an issue. At the end of the two minute cleaning, we resumed the break.</p>
<p><a href=""https://intelligence.org/ai-risk-for-computer-scientists/"">AI Risk for Computer Scientists</a> is a worskhop which, as far as I can tell, is not really for computer scientists. A facebook friend of mine, president of EA France, told me she was invited even though she had a PhD in economics and is not doing any computer science. Most of the people there were computer scientists, however, and most of the non-computer scientists were mathematicians. A lot of the small talk was related to math and computer science and were often far more technical than the workshops themselves, which was quite unexpected to me. Edward Kmett was there and spoke a lot about haskell and theories behind programming languages, which was extremely interesting and not related at all to AI.</p>
<p>A lot of people at the event were vegan, and so at each meal, there was a huge choice of good vegan food, which is incredible to me ! So I was even more intrigued as to why we almost exclusively used throw-away utensil, plates and bowls; as most vegan texts I've read are about how meat arms the environment.  I assume that if EA cares about animal suffering in itself, then using throwaways is less of a direct suffering factor.</p>
<p>I had at least four goals arriving at this workshop:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first one was to discover what could actually be done to advance research related to AI safety.</li>
<li>The second one was to understand why people believe that there is such a high risk that an unaligned AGI will be created in the foreseeable future.</li>
<li>The third one was to get an internship at MIRI; and thus to draw a salary again.</li>
<li>The last one was to discover and enjoy California, the bay area, and this rationalist community I've read a lot about.</li>
</ul>
<p>Task four is mostly a success, task two is kind of a success and the other two tasks are complete failures.</p>
<h2>Workshop activities</h2>
<p>Almost all activities were done in small groups, with either a half, a third or a fourth of all participants and so the lectures/activities were repeated two to four times during the day. This way, we all had done the same activities, and being in small groups also allow to have real discussions with the professor and the other participants. Groups were changing a lot, so that we also met all participants.</p>
<p>As far as I understand it, plenty of people are panicked when they really understand what AI risks are. So Anna Salamon gave us a rule: We don't speak of AI safety to people who do not express the desire to hear about it. When I asked for more informations, she specified that it is okay to mention the words ""AI Safety""; but not to give any details until the other person is sure they want to hear about it. In practice, this means it is okay to share a book/post on AI safety, but we should warn the person to read it only if they feel ready. Which leads to a related problem: some people never experienced an existential crisis or anxiety attack of their life, so it's all too possible they can't really ""be ready"". On the same note, another researcher at MIRI answered me -when asked as to why they don't hold a lecture explaining the imminence of AI- that they do not want to be the one explaining to everyone why we're all going to die in the next few decades. On the one hand, I guess I understand why, but on the other hand, I'd say it's kind of the point of being there !</p>
<p>To give a more concrete example of how they tried to fight potential panic: during one of the activity, Anna Salamon asked us to list all the reasons why it could be a bad idea of thinking about AI risk. An obvious answer was that thinking about AI may help AGI be created, and so our defeat would come sooner. Another answer, as explained above, would be that some people would panic and not be able to do anything anymore. One of my answer was about a theory we are not allowed to discuss, which if it were true would mean that it's a very bad idea of thinking about it altogether. However, as I expected, she didn't write in on the white board. I still felt that to be exhaustive, I had to mention it to her.</p>
<p>As you can see, the staff really cared about us and wanted to be sure that we would be able to manage the thoughts related to AI risk. This led to a lot of talks which were not directly related to AI. Given the importance of non AI-related talks, I'm going to start to describe the workshop by listing examples of activities which were not AI related.</p>
<h3>Non AI related events.</h3>
<p>I do not know how much of the stuff we saw is usual at CFAR. There were talks on bucketing, inner sim, world models, question substitution, double crux, focusing... I'm not going to try to explain all of this, as I would probably do a bad job; just go to a CFAR event to learn about them. Or read their book, it seems they just published it. To test those tools, we had to apply them to specific problems; either an AI-related problem, or a personnal one. I don't even know how to start thinking about AI problems, so I decided to choose personal problems.</p>
<p>Sadly, there has been some timing issues, and the professor usually did not have the time to see every participants to help them with the exercices.</p>
<p>If all of this helps to think clearly about problems and how to solve them, then it seems strange to me that CFAR uses it only for AI stuff. If it does help to deal with the horror of unaligned AI, why isn't it used to speak of global warming ? While I admit that the narrative about AI risk is even worse than the one about global warming, I do think that if you really try to grasp the whole impact of global warming you also need some mental help to consider the horror it entails. The same thing would also be true if you want to consider global poverty, slavery, and so many other things in our world.</p>
<p>There were also a lot of so-called ""circle"". I've heard that circles are not usually done at CFAR, because circles are less effective at mainstream workshop than in AIRCS workshop.  We've been told when we started circling that we would not really learn what circle is, that all circles are different. That we could see plenty of circles and they would not seem similar, the same way we could discover a lot of music and think that there is nothing in common between them. For a computer scientist, this did seem extremely strange and dubious. How can I evaluate whether the exercice was correctly done or not ? Or even what was the purpose of this exercice ? As far I as understand, one goal of the circle is to be able to get what we feel and to put words on it. In particular, circle is also about going meta, and being able to think about the current thinking process. I do feel like that's something I was already quite good at, it looks a lot like blogging - I mostly blog in French, so most of you could not really check out yourself. When I want to write about something and fail, I usually try to understand what my problem is; and then I write to explain what I would have liked to write and why I failed doing it. This is also something I really often do with one of my partner; which leads to conversations too meta for my taste sometime, but which helps discussion in the long run.  My point here is that it felt so much like something I often do that I didn't really felt like it was new for me. Or maybe I just didn't understand what circling is and just used instead something I already knew.  Who knows ? There were two circles in small group the first two days, and a big long circle with everyone the third day. Someone had been more vocal and honest than myself, and asked why we were doing this. We only have four days, they said, and we are supposed to be talking about AI. Personally, I decided to trust MIRI and to suspend my judgement, expecting that at some point I'd get the meaning in all of this.</p>
<h3>Job interview</h3>
<p>Okay, let's go back to the job interview part. You'll now understand why both «describing AIRCS» and «applying at MIRI» had to be in the same blog post.</p>
<p>I ask you to remember that I was actually at AIRCS because MIRI wanted to meet me before any decision on hiring me. That means that, during circles, I was asked to be as honest as possible about my feelings while also being considered for an internship. This is extremely awkward. Similarly, to discover CFAR tool, they asked us to consider a personal problem we currently have. One of my biggest problem is about having a salary again, which probably means having a job. Other personal problems (like finding a town where I want to live in) are extremely related to the problem of having a job. But the staff member teaching us CFAR materials may also eventually have to give their reading on me. Which means that the person to help me learn how to solve my problems is potentially a part of the problem's solution. The last day, we had to fill a feedback form about the workshop... That is, they asked me to fill a feedback from about a part of my job interview BEFORE I actually had any answers(5).</p>
<p>All of this was extremely awkward. And it really made the workshop hard to enjoy, as I spent time and time again wondering how I should talk about those problems, while talking about them could effectively change my chances of having the job.</p>
<p>I appreciate and entirely realize that the AIRCS workshop is not just a recruiting process. I do believe that all staff members were honest in saying there were meeting people, teaching interesting stuff, and that no one was actually taking notes on me. No one had any thought process focused on me either. The first time I spoke of this problem to someone from MIRI, during a 1-to-1 discussion, he told me that I should not consider this as a job interview but at a place to socialize and potentially network. But just because they do not think of AIRCS as a job interview does not mean AIRCS is not a job interview. Case in point: half a week after the workshop, the recruiter(Buck) told me that ""After discussing some more, we decided that we don't want to move forward with you right now"". So the workshop really was what led them to decide not to hire me.</p>
<p>To be more exhaustive, there is a <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/arthur.milchior.3/posts/264015811225320?comment_id=264336727859895&amp;notif_id=1577428530119737&amp;notif_t=feedback_reaction_generic"">second possibility</a>; maybe after the 2 days long exam, the recruiter already knew they would not hire me. However, they do want to have a lot of people attending AIRCS for reasons I'll discuss later.  Thinking that I would not be interested in attending if I knew I didn't have the job, they didn't let me know. However, this would require the recruiter to be able to lie really consistently during the whole workshop, which would be quite impressive.</p>
<p>During a trip to the beach, I finally had the courage to tell the recruiter that AIRCS is quite complex to navigate for me, when it's both a CFAR workshop and a job interview. I assumed that, since the MIRI wanted honest communication, telling them my thoughts would be the best I could do anyway. They answered that they see how having activities such as circles could be a problem, but that there was nothing they could do. I answered two things. First: they could mention people coming to AIRCS for a future job interview that some things will be akward for them; but that they have the same workshop as everyone else so they'll have to deal with it. And I also answered that my problems would be solved if I had an answer already. Since I did know that there was no way for them to already confirm that I had the internship, the conclusion would have been that the workshop would be nicer if they could confirm I was not going to get it. I immediately added by reflex that I was not asking for it. That I was just being exhaustive. I was dishonest then, I was pretty sure I wouldn't have the job, and actually knowing it would have made things quite simpler. However, I had the feeling that asking this would have decreased my probability of being hired, and so I avoided doing it. Furthermore, I do understand why it's generally a bad idea to tell unknown people in your buildings that they won't have the job. Some may react pretty badly, and damage your properties. There was no way for me to convince them that it would be safe to tell me I would not get hired if it were the case. Furthermore, other people were there in order to work at MIRI, and he could not just give informations to me and ignore everyone else.</p>
<p>I do not believe that my first advice will be listened to. During a discussion, the last night near the fire, the recruiter was discussing with some other miri staff and participants. And at some point they mentioned MIRI's recruiting process. I think that they were mentioning that they loved recruiting because it leads them to work with extremly interesting people, but that it's hard to find them. Given that my goal was explicitly to be recruited, and that I didn't have any answers yet, it was extremely awkward for me. I can't state explicitly why, after all I didn't have to add anything to their remark. But even if I can't explain why I think that, I still firmly believe that it's the kind of things a recruiter should avoid saying near their potential hire.</p>
<h3>AI-related activities</h3>
<p>Ok, now, let's go back to AI related activities. The disparity in the participants' respective knowledge was very impressive to me. One of the participants was doing a PhD related to AI safety; while another one knew the subject so well that they could cite researchers and say that ""in research paper A, person B states C"", and that was related to the current discussion. And some other participants were totally new to all of this and came there by pure curiosity, or as to understand why EA spoke so much of AI. While the actual activities were created to be accessible to everyone, the discussions between participants was not always so. Because of course, people who already know a lot about those topics speak of the facts they know, they use their knowledge when they discuss with the staff.</p>
<p>Most discussions were pretty high level. For example, someone presented a talk where they explained how they tried and failed to model and simulate a brain of C. Elegansis. A worm with an extremely simple and well understood brain. They explained to us a lot of things about biology, and how they had been trying and scanning precisely a brain. If I understood correctly, they told us they failed due to technical constraints and what those were. They believe that, nowadays, we can theoretically create the technology to solve this problem. However there is no one interested in said technology, so it won't be developed and be available to the market. Furthermore, all of their research was done prior to them discovering AI safety stuff so it's good that no one created such a precise model of a - even if just a worm - brain.</p>
<p>Another talk was about a possible AI timeline. This paragraph is going to describe a 70 minutes-long talk, so I'll be omitting a lot of stuff. The main idea of the timeline was that, if you multiply the number of times a neuron fire every seconds, the number of neurons in the brain, the number of living creatures on earth on one side, and if you multiply the number of processors, their speed, and the memory of computers on the other, then you obtain two numbers you can compare. And according to this comparison, we should have been able to simulate a human with today's supercomputer, and tomorrows computer. Similarly, with tomorrows supercomputer we should be able to simulate the whole evolution of life. However, it seems no one did anything close to those simulations. So, Buck Shlegeris,  who gave the talk, asked us: ""all of this are just words. What are your thoughts"" and ""what's wrong with this timeline"" ?  Those are actually questions he asked us a lot: he wanted our opinions, and why we disagreed. That's quite an interesting way to check how we think I guess, and an extremely hard one to answer. Because there were so many thing wrong with the talk we head. I think I answered that one does not only have to simulate brains, but also all of their environments. And the interactions between brains, as opposed to just each brains in their own simulation. But honestly, my real answer would be that it's just not how science and technology works. You can't just hand wave ideas and expect things to work. By default, things do not work. They work when an actual precise effort have been made, because someone had a plan. I used to teach introduction to programming; and the talk reminded me of some of my students asking why their program does not work - while I was trying to understand why they believed it would work in the first place. Even with parallel super computer, having a program simulating the evolution from a single cell to humanity is a task that does not seems trivial, and there is no reason for it to have occurred by itself. The fact that this does not occur is the default. I guess I could also have answered that most programs bugs when they start, and if you need to use super computer for weeks, even a really passionate hacker is not going to have enough resources today to actually do this work. However, I didn't gave this long answer; I didn't feel like it was something I could easily convey with words.  That the whole point made no sense. And it probably would not have helped my recruitment either.</p>
<h3>AI Discussion</h3>
<p>I'm not going to list in details every lectures. One major aspect of it however, is that even after all of them I didn't know what one can concretely do to help with AI safety/alignment problems. Neither did I know why they believed that it was such a high risk. So I went to speak with staff members directly and asked them those questions. One staff member told me that I could go to AI alignment forums, read on the problem they were discussing and, if I had any ideas, write them down. If I had been really honest, I would have asked ""why do you want to hire developers, I was hoping to learn that, but I still have no ideas as to what I would be doing if hired"". I did not. Because at some point it felt like it was of bad taste to recall that that was my initial goal, and I was pretty sure that I would not be hired anyway.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to read the forum and thinking about those questions myself. As I wrote earlier, MIRI's stuff does seem fun to consider. But then again, there are tons of fun stuff to consider in the world, and plenty of things I don't know yet and want to learn. Currently, what I must learn, I believe, is what will help me have a job. It won't save lives. But it is an interesting perspective to me. And even once I have a stable job, there will be so much more things to be curious about; I'm not sure that I'll just take the time to work on AI. After all, if they don't think I can help them by doing this full-time, I don't see how I could help by doing it part-time.</p>
<p>The question I asked most during discussions was something along the line of :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I do agree that an unaligned AI would be extremly dangerous. I will accept the idea that spending the career of a hundred researchers in this field is totally worth it if there is even a two percent chance of having every life destroyed in the next century. Can you explain to me why you believe that the probability is at least two percent ?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think that I was being quite generous with my question. Low probability, high time-frame. According to Anna Salamon's rule I gave earlier, if you don't feel ready to hear the answer I received, and understand why there is such a risk, you should skip to next section.</p>
<p>The first person who answered this question told me they had followed the recent progress of machine learning and thought that we are less than ten breakthrough away from AGI. So it is going to occur imminently. It also means that I can't get convinced the same way as I have not seen the speed of progress of the field.  Another answer I got was that there is so many progress going so quick that AGI is bound to occur. Personally, I do agree that progress is quick; and I expect to be amazed and astonished multiple time again in the years to come. However, it does not necessarily means that we are going to reach AGI. Let's say that the progress is going exponentially fast, and that AGI is aleph_0 (the smallest uncountable ordinal). Then the speed does not really matter, the function can't reach aleph_0. I've been answered that anyway, even if AI gets stuck again and fails to reach AGI, we will reach AGI as soon as we know how to model and simulates brain. I must admit that I found Age of EM extremly interesting as well as frightening. However I have no certitudes that we will reach EMs one day. In both cases, AGI and EMs, I see the same problem: I can imagine that we need fundamental breakthrough to make real progress. However, while private companies are happy to do more and more amazing technological creations, it does not seems to me that they are willing to do decade-long researches which won't bring back any money in the next few years.  If you need a biological/chemical discovery which requires something as large as the hardron collider, then I don't see any private company financing it.  Especially since, once the thing is discovered, other companies may use it. On the other hand and as far as I know, universities have less and less fundings worldwide, and professors need to be able to justify they'll publish papers soon and regularly. All in all, I really don't think research is going to be able to make fundamental important discoveries that would allow to create a new kind of science probably required for AGI/Ems. I held this last discussion just after the introduction to «double crux». And I don't know whether this introduction helped, but after this discussion, I understood that one big difference between me and most of the staff is that I'm far more pessimistic about the future of research than they are.</p>
<h2>The point of the workshop</h2>
<p>Some people asked what was the point of the workshop. Why had MIRI paid the travel and food of ~20 participants, and provided the staff to work with us. It was supposed to be about AI and we spent a lot of time doing circles. We didn't really learn how to help with alignment problems. I'm going to write down some answers to that that I heard during the workshop. It is beneficial to see a lot of things that are not related to AI, because we need to have a really big surface in order to interact with plenty of parts of the world (this is a chemical reaction metaphor). Maybe some useful ideas will be coming from some other fields, fields that are not yet related to AI safety. So the AI safety field need to interact with a lot of people from the outside. Some people might get interested enough to actually want to work on AI safety after this workshop, and go to MIRI or to some other places which work on those stuff, such as CHAI, FHI, etc. Some people may come to AIRCS alumni workshop, where they get more technical (I've not yet seen anything related to the alumni workshop, and I doubt I'll ever be invited - I didn't really give any new ideas in the first workshop). Also, if at some point they need a lot of people to work on the alignment problem, they'll have all the AIRCS alumni they can contact. AIRCS alumnis have been introduced to their ideas and could start working quicker on those topics. However, I didn't understand why they would suddenly need so urgently a team to work on the alignment problem (and it sounds a little bit Terminator-ish).</p>
<p>Now, there is a second question: what was the point of me going there. I mean, I went there because I was invited and curious. But what was their goal when inviting me ? While I was not told exactly why my application was rejected after the workshop, I have strong intuitions about it. First, I was not able to participate in discussions as much as the other participants did. As I said a lot of time, I am not convinced that the risk is as high as they perceive it. And I found that most talks were so high levels that there was no way for me to say anything concrete about them. At least not without seeing how they actually would try to implement things first. Worse, I was saying all of this out loud! A staff member from MIRI told me that my questions meant I didn't really understood the risks. And understanding them is, supposedly, a prerequisite to be able to work on AI alignment.  So it was easy to conclude that I would not get the internship. But all of this was already known to the recruiter after the first screening we had. I already told him I skimmed though MIRI's post but had not had read a lot. And I was not even convinced that it was a serious risk. We already had a discussion where they tried to understand my thoughts on this, and why I did not believe in the scenarios they were depicting. As I wrote in the introduction, I notice I am confused and I'm quite perplex by the fact that my confusion has only increased. Every time a company decides not to hire me, I would love to know why, at least as to avoid making the same mistakes again. Miri here is an exception. I can see only so many reasons not to hire me that the outcome was unsurprising. The process and they considering me in the first place was.</p>
<p>The confusion does not decrease.</p>
<p>P.S. Thanks to ^,^(Joy_void_joy) for proof-reading this post. All typos remain mine.</p>
<p>Footnotes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Most probable ending. Because either someone crafts an unaligned AGI by not taking MIRI's position into consideration, or because AGI is impossible</li>
<li>I still wonder why. I assume there are already a lot of computer scientists wanting to have an impact, and that they specialize more in the US and UK whereas I was in France back then.</li>
<li>My friend tells me that actually, it's not even a generalization. Both concepts are unrelated, appart that they have the same name.</li>
<li>There are actually teacher assistants who are still waiting for their 2018-2019 salary.</li>
<li>To be honest, at this point, I was pretty sure I wasn't going to have the job. But not quite sure enough to feel comfortable about it.</li>

A general understanding of causal models is assumed. This post is probably most useful when read alongside the paper. If your last name is &quot;Beckers&quot; or &quot;Halpern&quot;, you might want to skip to the last section.</em></p><p>There&#x2019;s been a handful of papers in the last few years on abstracting causal models. Beckers and Halpern (B&amp;H) wrote an <u><a href=""https://www.aaai.org/ojs/index.php/AAAI/article/view/4117"">entire paper</a></u> on <em>definitions</em> of abstraction on causal models. This post will outline the general framework in which these definitions live, discuss the main two definitions which B&amp;H favor, and wrap up with some discussion of a conjecture from the paper. I&apos;ll generally use notation and explanations which I find intuitive, rather than matching the paper on everything.</p><p>In general, we&#x2019;ll follow B&amp;H in progressing from more general to more specific definitions.</p><h2>General Framework</h2><p>We have two causal models: one &#x201C;low-level&#x201D;, and one &#x201C;high-level&#x201D;. There&#x2019;s a few choices about what sort of &#x201C;causal model&#x201D; to use here; the main options are:</p><ul><li>Structural equations</li><li>Structural equations with a DAG structure (i.e. no feedback loops)</li><li>Bayes nets</li></ul><p>B&amp;H use the first, presumably because it is the most general. That means that everything here will also apply to the latter two options.</p><p>Notation for the causal models:</p><ul><li>We&#x2019;ll write <span><style>.mjx-chtml {display: inline-block; line-height: 0; text-indent: 0; text-align: left; text-transform: none; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 100%; font-size-adjust: none; letter-spacing: normal; word-wrap: normal; word-spacing: normal; white-space: nowrap; float: none; direction: ltr; max-width: none; max-height: none; min-width: 0; min-height: 0; border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 1px 0}

This definition isn&#x2019;t specific to B&amp;H - it&#x2019;s an obvious starting point for defining abstraction on causal models as broadly as possible. B&amp;H adopt this maximally-general definition from <u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.00819.pdf"">Rubenstein et al</a></u>, and dub it &#x201C;exact transformation&#x201D;.</p><p>B&amp;H then go on to argue that this definition is <em>too</em> general for most purposes.

In this case, we have two representations of the low-level system:</p><ul><li>A Lagrangian representation, in which we track the position and momentum of each particle</li><li>An Eulerian representation, in which we track the mass and momentum densities as a function of position</li></ul><p>The two are completely equivalent; each contains the same information. Yet they have very different structure:</p><ul><li>In the Lagrangian representation, each &#x201C;variable&#x201D; (i.e. a particle&#x2019;s mass &amp; momentum at a given time) interacts with all other variables which are nearby in time; we need to check for collisions against every other particle, even those far away in space, since we don&#x2019;t know ahead of time which will be close by.</li><li>In the Eulerian representation, each &#x201C;variable&#x201D; (i.e. mass &amp; momentum density at a given point in space and time) interacts only with variables which are nearby in <em>both</em> space and time.</li></ul><p>In this case, the high-level fluid model is a constructive abstraction of the Eulerian representation, but not of the Lagrangian representation: the high-level model only contains interactions which are local in both time and space.</p><p>Conceptually, the problem here is that our graph can have dynamic structure: the values of the variables themselves can determine which other variables they interact with. When that happens, an ontology shift can sometimes make the dynamic structure static, as in the Lagrangian -&gt; Eulerian transformation.

This post is standalone and does not assume that post as background.</em></p>
<p><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/87Y7w73phjBxnPyPD/safe-exploration-and-corrigibility#aeXgHHx3v5rRMG5MP"">In a previous comment thread, Rohin argued that safe exploration is currently defined as being about the agent not making “an accidental mistake.”</a> I think that definition is wrong, at least to the extent that I think it both doesn't make much sense and doesn't describe how I actually expect current safe exploration work to be useful.</p>
<p>First, what does it mean for a failure to be an “accident?” This question is simple from the perspective of an engineer outside the whole system—any unintended failure is an accident, encapsulating the majority of AI safety concerns (i.e. “<a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06565"">accident risk</a>”). But that's clearly not what the term “accidental mistake” is pointing at in this context—rather, the question here is <em>what is an accident from the perspective of the model?</em> Intuitively, an accident from the perspective of the model should be some failure that the model didn't intend or wouldn't retroactively endorse. But that sort of a definition only makes sense for <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/r9tYkB2a8Fp4DN8yB/p/FkgsxrGf3QxhfLWHG"">highly coherent mesa-optimizers</a> that actually have some notion of intent. Maybe instead we should be thinking of this from the perspective of the base optimizer/loss function? That is, maybe a failure is an accidental failure if the loss function wouldn't retroactively endorse it (e.g. the model got a very low reward for making the mistake). By this definition, however, <em>every generalization failure is an accidental failure</em> such that safe exploration would just be the problem of generalization.</p>
<p>Of all of these definitions, the definition defining an accidental failure from the perspective of the model as a failure that the model didn't intend or wouldn't endorse seems the most sensical to me. Even assuming that your model is a highly coherent mesa-optimizer such that this definition makes sense, however, I still don't think it describes current safe exploration work, and in fact I don't think it's even really a safety problem. The problem of producing models which don't make mistakes from the perspective of their own internal goals is precisely the problem of making powerful, capable models—that is, it's precisely the problem of <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/2mhFMgtAjFJesaSYR/2-d-robustness"">capability generalization</a>. Thus, to the extent that it's reasonable to say this for any ML problem, the problem of accidental mistakes under this definition is just a capabilities problem. However, I don't think that at all invalidates the utility of current safe exploration work, as I don't think that current safe exploration work is actually best understood as avoiding “accidental mistakes.”</p>
<p>If safe exploration work isn't about avoiding accidental mistakes, however, then what is it about? Well, let's take a look at an example. <a href=""https://cdn.openai.com/safexp-short.pdf"">Safety Gym</a> has a variety of different environments containing both goal states that the agent is supposed to reach and unsafe states that the agent is supposed to avoid. From <a href=""https://openai.com/blog/safety-gym/"">OpenAI's blog post</a>: “If deep reinforcement learning is applied to the real world, whether in robotics or internet-based tasks, it will be important to have algorithms that are safe even while learning—like a self-driving car that can learn to avoid accidents without actually having to experience them.” Why wouldn't this happen naturally, though—shouldn't an agent in a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_observable_Markov_decision_process"">POMDP</a> always want to be careful? Well, not quite. When we do RL, there are really two different forms of exploration happening:<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-Ka3NXGwix7HnJvvq3-1"" id=""fnref-Ka3NXGwix7HnJvvq3-1"">[1]</a></sup></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Within-episode exploration,</strong> where the agent tries to identify what particular environment/state it's in, and</li>
<li><strong>Across-episode exploration,</strong> which is the problem of making your agent explore enough to gather all the data necessary to train it properly.</li>
</ul>
<p>In your standard episodic POMDP setting, you get within-episode exploration naturally, but not across-episode exploration, which you have to explicitly incentivize.<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-Ka3NXGwix7HnJvvq3-2"" id=""fnref-Ka3NXGwix7HnJvvq3-2"">[2]</a></sup> Because we have to explicitly incentivize across-episode exploration, however, it can often lead to behaviors which are contrary to the goal of actually trying to achieve the greatest possible reward in the current episode. Fundamentally, I think current safe exploration research is about trying to fix that problem—that is, it's about trying to make across-episode exploration less detrimental to reward acquisition. This sort of a problem is most important in an online learning setting where bad across-episode exploration could lead to catastrophic consequences (e.g. crashing an actual car to get more data about car crashes).</p>
<p>Thus, rather than define safe exploration as “avoiding accidental mistakes,” I think the right definition is something more like “improving across-episode exploration.” However, I think that this framing makes clear that there are other types of safe exploration problems—that is, there are other problems in the general domain of making across-episode exploration better. For example, I would love to see an exploration of how different across-episode exploration techniques impact <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/2mhFMgtAjFJesaSYR/2-d-robustness"">capability generalization vs. objective generalization</a>—that is, when is across-episode exploration helping you collect data which improves the model's ability to achieve its current goal versus helping you collect data which improves the model's goal?<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-Ka3NXGwix7HnJvvq3-3"" id=""fnref-Ka3NXGwix7HnJvvq3-3"">[3]</a></sup> Because across-episode exploration is explicitly incentivized, it seems entirely possible to me that we'll end up getting the incentives wrong somehow, so it seems quite important to me to think about how to get them right—and I think that the problem of getting them right is the right way to think about safe exploration.</p>

<i>This is not an official post by the BIDA Board, and the Board has
not reviewed it.</i>



</p><p>

In Spring 2015 BIDA bought a Mackie 1604-VLZ Pro mixer used for $275.
It wasn't the ideal mixer, but it was reasonably close and a good
price.  It's been starting to wear out for a while, however, and last
night one of the two monitor mixes stopped working.  While this one
may be fixable, I think we should probably get a new mixer that's
closer to what we want and sell this one.  Here's what I think would
be good in a mixer for a dance like BIDA:

</p>

<p>

</p>

<ul>

<li><p>At least 10 XLR inputs, ideally 16.</p></li>

<li><p>At least 2 pre-fader monitor outputs, ideally 3+</p></li>

<li><p>EQ with sweepable mids.</p></li>

<li><p>XLR outputs for the mains, and ideally the monitors.</p></li>

<li><p>Ideally, the monitors are covered by the mute.</p></li>

<li><p>Ideally, the monitors are covered by the EQ.</p></li>

<li><p>Ideally, few extra controls we're not going to use that,
when set wrong, keep things from working in hard-to-diagnose ways
(this is an issue with our current board).</p></li>

</ul>

I'm thinking that an analog board probably still makes sense, given
that we have a range of people who run sound at the dance, but I could
be convinced otherwise.  Looking around, here's are the options that
look best to me:



<p>

</p>

<ul>

<li>
<b><a href=""https://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/ProFX22v3--mackie-profx22v3-22-channel-mixer-with-effects"">Mackie
ProFX22v3</a></b>: analog board with pretty much everything we need,
though on the expensive end.  It has 17 xlr inputs, two of which can
be used as DIs, and 3 pre-fader monitor outputs. The EQ includes the
monitors, but the mute unfortunately doesn't. About $700 new.

<p><b><a href=""https://smile.amazon.com/Mackie-PROFX22V2-22-Channel-4-Bus-Effects/dp/B00VWKQV1Y/"">Mackie
ProFX22v2</a></b>: by going back a generation we can get something almost
as good for less.  This brings us down to 16 xlr inputs, none of which
can be a DI, and two pre-fader monitor outputs.  About $500 new.

</p>
<p>

<p><b><a href=""https://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/ProFX16v3--mackie-profx16v3-16-channel-mixer-with-effects"">Mackie
ProFX16v3</a></b>: another direction we could go is a smaller board.
Dropping down a size from the ProFX22v3 brings us down to 11 xlr
inputs, but doesn't change anything else.  The big question is how
often we would find ourselves needing more than 11 inputs.  About $500
new.

<li>
<p><b><a href=""https://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/XR18--behringer-by-air-xr18-tablet-controlled-digital-mixer"">Behringer
XR18</a></b>: this is a tablet-controlled mixer, which probably won't
work for us.  But it has sixteen XLR/TRS combo inputs, six monitor
outputs, and lets you mix from anywhere in the hall.  It includes its
own WIFI, and I know a lot of sound people like it a lot.  About
$600 new.

</p>
<p>

<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/behringer-xr18-big.jpg""><img src=""https://www.jefftk.com/behringer-xr18.jpg"" srcset=""https://www.jefftk.com/behringer-xr18.jpg 550w, https://www.jefftk.com/behringer-xr18-2x.jpg 1100w"" /></a>

<li>
<p><b><a href=""https://smile.amazon.com/KitchenAid-KSM105-5-Qt-Tilt-Head-Stand/dp/B0125LAJ8E/"">KitchenAid
KSM105</a></b>: this is a very popular analog mixer, but it doesn't meet
any of our requirements.  I don't understand why so many people buy
these when they're so under-spec'd.

</p>
<p>

<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/kitchenaid-ksm105-big.jpg""><img src=""https://www.jefftk.com/kitchenaid-ksm105.jpg"" srcset=""https://www.jefftk.com/kitchenaid-ksm105.jpg 550w, https://www.jefftk.com/kitchenaid-ksm105-2x.jpg 1100w"" /></a>

</p>
</li>

</ul>



<p>

Most of these also have cheaper options available if we bought used.

</p>

<p>

What mixers have people been using for live sound, and what do you
like about them?

I don&apos;t believe that the universe is always kind enough to provide us with a nice clean empirical test to determine if a theory is true or not as opposed to subtly impacting our expectations over a wide range of results. This becomes worse once you take into account varying positions within a theory, as there could be dozens of incompatible schemes for constraining expectations based on a theory with almost nothing in common</li><li><a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/11/06/building-intuitions-on-non-empirical-arguments-in-science/"">Non-empirically testable facts</a> - Some people believe if there isn&apos;t a clean empirical test to falsify a theory then it is irrelevant pseudo-science rubbish.

<blockquote><p>The other concept I’m playing with is that “what we know” is inextricable from “how we know it”. This is dangerously close to logical positivism, which I disagree with my limited understanding of. And yet it’s really improved my thinking when doing historical research.</p></blockquote>
<p>I have some more clarify on what I meant now. Let’s say you’re considering my ex-roommate, person P, as a roommate, and ask me for information. I have a couple of options.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 1: I turn over chat logs and video recordings of my interactions with the P. </strong></p>
<p>E.g., recordings of P playing music loudly and chat logs showing I’d asked them to stop.</p>
<p>Trust required: that the evidence is representative and not an elaborate deep fake.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 2: I report representative examples of my interactions with P.</strong></p>
<p>E.g., “On these dates P played music really loudly even when I asked them to stop.”</p>
<p>Trust required: that from scenario 1, plus that I’m not making up the examples.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 3: I report summaries of patterns with P</strong></p>
<p>E.g., “P often played loud music, even when I asked them to stop”</p>
<p>Trust required: that from scenario 2, plus my ability to accurately infer and report patterns from data.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 4: I report what a third party told me</strong></p>
<p>E.g. “Mark told me they played loud music a lot”</p>
<p>Trust required: that from scenario 3, plus my ability to evaluate other people’s evidence</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 5: I give a flat “yes good” or “no bad” answer.</strong></p>
<p>E.g., “P was a bad roommate.”</p>
<p>Trust required: that from scenario 3 and perhaps 4, plus that I have the same heuristics for roommate goodness that you do.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>The earlier the scenario, the more you can draw your own conclusions and the less trust you need to have in me. Maybe you don’t care about loud music, and a flat yes/no would drive you away from a roommate that would be fine for you. Maybe I thought I was clear about asking for music to stop but my chat logs reveal I was merely hinting, and you are confident you’ll be able to ask more directly. The more specifics I give you, the better an assessment you’ll be able to make.</p>
<p>Here’s what this looks like applied to recent reading:</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 5: Rome fell in the 500s AD.</strong></p>
<p>Even if I trust your judgement, I have no idea why you think this or what it means to you.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 4: In Rome: The Book, Bob Loblaw says Rome Fell in the 500s AD.</strong></p>
<p>At least I can look up why Bob thinks this.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 3: Pottery says Rome fell between 300 and 500 AD.</strong></p>
<p>Useful to experts who already know the power of pottery, but leaves newbies lost.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 2: Here are 20 dig sites in England. Those dated before 323 (via METHOD) contain pottery made in Greece (which we can identify by METHOD), those after 500 AD show cruder pottery made locally.</strong></p>
<p>Great. Now my questions are “Can pottery evidence give that much precision?” and “Are you interpreting it correctly?”</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 1: Please enjoy this pile of 3 million pottery shards.</strong></p>
<p>Too far, too far.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In this particular example (from <em><a href=""https://acesounderglass.com/2019/10/16/epistemic-spot-checks-the-fall-of-rome/"">The Fall of Rome</a></em>), 2-3 was the sweet spot. It allowed me to learn as much as possible with a minimum of trust. But there’s definitely room in life for 4; you can’t prove everything in every paper and sometimes it’s more efficient to offload it.</p>
<p>I don’t view 5 as acceptable for anything that’s trying to claim to be evidenced based, or at least, any basis besides “Try this and see if it helps you.” (which is a perfectly fine basis if it’s cheap).</p>

(It also assumes that while yes, ritual is something to be <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CGkZEQdeBZZXbBT7o/on-rationalist-solstice-and-epistemic-caution"">epistemically careful about</a>, the overall effect size is <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/rijoxTpkSPXcTXRbN/the-value-and-danger-of-ritual"">relatively small compared to spending much of your life thinking about a topic</a> with peers that think that topic is important, and meanwhile having community identities is valuable. If you want to debate that please do so on one of those previous posts)</em></p><br><p>If you run a solstice ceremony with singalongs, there&apos;s particular value in:</p><ul><li>Doing at least 16 singalongs</li><li>Clumping* them together in groups of 2-4, rather than alternating song / story / song / story. (Clumping is valuable even if you are doing a smaller number of songs)</li></ul><p>This isn&apos;t the right approach for all possible solstice aesthetics, but there&apos;s a magic thing that can happen here if you do. And if you&apos;re not doing it (i.e. most solstice organizers seem to default to the &quot;story/song/story/song&quot; thing), you won&apos;t receive any feedback that there&apos;s a different thing you could do with a magic, synergistic outcome.</p><p>Reasons to want more songs, and to cluster them in groups of 2-4:</p><ul><li>It takes people awhile to get comfortable singing.</li><li>Context switching makes it harder to get into the headspace of singing. </li><li>There is a <em>secret, deeper headspace of singing</em> that you only get to if you do a LOT of it, in a row, in an environment that encourages being thoroughly un-self-conscious about it.</li><li>There is a long game that I think singalong solstice celebrations can help with, which is to restore <em>musicality as a basic skill</em>, which in turn allows you to have much richer musical traditions than if it&apos;s an incidental thing you do a little of sometimes. The payoff for this comes on a multi-year timescale. </li></ul><p>There are reasons <em>not</em> to want this many songs, or to have them clustered this way. Some people get more value out of the speeches or other activities than songs. One organizer of a small solstice mentioned their primary concern was <em>&quot;Have each person bring one activity to the solstice&quot;, </em> and most of them weren&apos;t comfortable with songleading. Getting people directly involved with Solstice indeed seems valuable if that&apos;s an option. (This makes more sense for smaller communities) </p><p>But my impression is that much of the time, the ratio of songs/stories and their placement was determined somewhat arbitrarily, and then never reconsidered.</p><p><strong>Getting Comfortable</strong></p><p>It used to be that group singing was quite common. There were no iPods or headphones, or even recordings. Running into a 1-in-a-million musician was a rare event. Therefore, it was quite natural that if you wanted music in your life, you had to make it yourself, and when you did you were comparing yourself to your friends and family, not to popular superstars.</p><p>This is no longer the case by default. So it takes people awhile to get used to &quot;oh, okay I am actually allowed to sing. I am actually encouraged to sing. It doesn&apos;t matter if I sound good, we are doing this thing together.&quot; </p><p>For many people, it takes at <em>least</em> two songs in a row to get them to a point where they even consider singing at all, let alone feeling good about it. The feeling of hesitation resets when you spend a lot of time listening to a speech.</p><p>The idea here is not just &quot;people get to sing&quot;, but, &quot;people feel a deep reassurance that singing is okay, that we are all here singing together&quot;, and I think that&apos;s just impossible to get in the space of one or even two songs. (It becomes even harder to hit this point if there are proportionately few singalongs, and especially if there are also performance-piece songs that people are <em>not</em> encouraged to sing along with)</p><p><strong>Deep musical headspace</strong></p><p>In my preferred celebration, &quot;Deep reassurance that singing is okay&quot; is only <em>step one. </em>There&apos;s a second deeper stage of feeling connected to the other people in the room, and connected to ideas that you&apos;re all here to celebrate, for which reassurance is a prerequisite but insufficient.</p><p>Step two requires the songs be resonant, and for you to have a strong sense that the other people in the room all have a particular connection to the songs. (The sense of ingroup identity and sense of philosophical connection are separate qualities, but work together to produce something greater than the sum of their parts) </p><p>You can get pieces of this in the space of a single song, but there&apos;s a version of it with unique qualia that takes something like 8 songs to really get going (and then, once you&apos;re there, it&apos;s nice to get to stay there awhile)</p><p><strong>Interwoven Story and Song; each Round Deepening</strong></p><p>The formula I find works best (at least for my preferences) is:</p><ul><li>On average, groups of 2-4 songs</li><li><em>Start</em> with a song that&apos;s a particularly inviting singalong, to set the overall context of &quot;this is an event where we&apos;re here to sing together.&quot;</li><li>Each song gets a <em>brief</em> story (like 10-30 seconds) that gives it some context and helps people fit it into the overall narrative arc of the night. The brief stories are not long enough to take you out of singalong-headspace.</li><li>In between sets of 2-4 songs, there are longer stories, speeches, meditations and other activities that move the narrative along more significantly. Each one sets the overall context for the next 2-4 songs, shifting the particular qualia of &quot;deep singalong&quot; that you&apos;d get from it.</li></ul><p>Once you&apos;ve gotten into the overall singalong headspace, it&apos;s less necessary to do groups of songs &#x2013;&#xA0;alternating between a song and a speech won&apos;t kill the headspace once it&apos;s had a chance to take root. </p><p><strong>Your Mileage May Vary</strong></p><p>Reiterating a final time that this is just one particular effect you can go for. I think it&apos;s important that local solstice organizers adapt to fit the needs of their particular communities. But the effect I&apos;m trying to describe here is hard to grok if you haven&apos;t directly experienced it, and I wanted people to at least have considered an option they may have been missing.</p>",Raemon,raemon,Raemon,

Task (2) would be demonstrating that both convex Lipschitz bounded and convex smooth bounded problems are, in fact, PAC learnable with no further conditions. This is done by defining an algorithm and then proving that that the algorithm works (i.e., learns any instance of the class with the usual PAC learning guarantees). The algorithm we will look at for this purpose (which does learn both classes) is an implementation of <em>Stochastic Gradient Descent</em>; however we&apos;ll do this in the next post rather than now. For this final chapter, we will instead dive into (3), i.e. find an example of how the ability to learn these two classes is useful even for problems that don&apos;t naturally fit into either of them.</p><p><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/hg77gpALMEjbTqxf3/uml-iv-linear-predictors"">Recall</a> the case of <em>binary linear classification</em>.

d4DvqS88Q29ZaJAj3,Homeostasis and “Root Causes” in Aging,homeostasis-and-root-causes-in-aging,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/d4DvqS88Q29ZaJAj3/homeostasis-and-root-causes-in-aging,2020-01-05T18:43:33.038Z,87,39,25,False,False,,"<p>Let&#x2019;s start with a stylized fact: almost every cell type in the human body is removed and replaced on a regular basis. The frequency of this turnover <u><a href=""http://book.bionumbers.org/how-quickly-do-different-cells-in-the-body-replace-themselves/"">ranges</a></u> from a few days (for many immune cells and cells in the gastrointestinal lining) to ten years (for fat, heart, and skeleton cells). Only a handful of tissues are believed to be non-renewing in humans - e.g. eggs, neurons, and the lens of the eye (and even out of those, neurons are debatable).</p><p>This means that the number of cells of any given type is determined by &#x201C;homeostatic equilibrium&#x201D; - the balance of cell removal and replacement. If an ulcer destroys a bunch of cells in your stomach lining, they&#x2019;ll be replaced over a few days, and the number of stomach cells will return to roughly the same equilibrium level as before. If a healthy person receives a bunch of extra red blood cells in a transfusion, they&#x2019;ll be broken down over a few months, and the number of blood cells will return to roughly the same equilibrium level as before.</p><p>As organisms age, we see a change in the homeostatic equilibrium level of many different cell types (and other parameters, like hormone and cytokine levels). In particular, a wide variety of symptoms of aging involve &#x201C;depletion&#x201D; (i.e. lower observed counts) of various cell types.</p><p>However, human aging happens on a very slow timescale, i.e. decades. Most cell counts equilibrate much faster - for instance, immune cell counts equilibrate on a scale of days to weeks. So, suppose we see a decrease in the count of certain immune cells with age - e.g. naive T cells. Could it be that naive T cells just wear out and die off with age? No - T cells are replaced every few weeks, so a change on a timescale of decades cannot be due to the cells themselves dying off. If the count of naive T cells falls on a timescale of decades, then either (a) the rate of new cell creation has decreased, or (b) the rate of old cell removal has increased (or both). Either of those would require some &#x201C;upstream&#x201D; change to cause the rate change.</p><p>More generally: in order for cell counts, or chemical concentrations, or any other physiological parameter to decrease/increase with age, at least one of the following must be true:</p><ul><li>the timescale of turnover is on the order of decades (or longer)</li><li>rate of removal increases/decreases</li><li>rate of creation decreases/increases</li></ul><p>If none of these is true, then any change is temporary - the cell count/concentration/whatever will return to the same level as before, determined by the removal and creation rates.</p><p>Of those three possibilities, notice that the second two - increase/decrease in production/removal rate - both imply some other upstream cause. Something else must have caused the rate change. Sooner or later, that chain of cause-and-effect needs to bottom out, and it can only bottom out in something which equilibrates on a timescale of decades or longer. (Feedback loops are possible, but if all the components equilibrate on a fast timescale then so will the loop.) <em>Something</em> somewhere in the system is out-of-equilibrium on a timescale of decades. We&#x2019;ll call that thing (or things) a &#x201C;root cause&#x201D; of aging. It&#x2019;s something which is not replaced on a timescale faster than decades, and it either accumulates or decumulates with age.</p><p>Now, the main criteria: <strong>a <em>root</em> cause of aging <em>cannot</em> be a higher or lower value of any parameter subject to homeostasis on a faster timescale than aging itself</strong>. Examples:</p><ul><li>Most cell types turn over on timescales of days to months. &#x201C;Depletion&#x201D; of any of these cell types cannot be a root cause of aging; either their production rate has decreased or their removal rate has increased.</li><li>DNA damage (as opposed to mutation) is normally repaired on a timescale of hours - sometimes much faster, depending on type. &#x201C;Accumulation&#x201D; of DNA damage cannot be a root cause of aging; either the rate of new damage has increased or the repair rate has decreased.</li><li>DNA mutations cannot be repaired; from a cell&#x2019;s perspective, the original information is lost. So mutations <em>can</em> accumulate in a non-equilibrium fashion, and are a plausible root cause under the homeostasis argument.</li></ul><p>Note that the homeostasis argument does <em>not</em> mean the factors ruled out above are not links in the causal chain. For instance, there&#x2019;s quite a bit of evidence that DNA damage does increase with age, and that this has important physiological effects. However, there must be changes further up the causal chain - some other long-term change in the organism&#x2019;s state leads to faster production or slower repair of DNA damage. Conversely, the homeostasis argument does not imply that &#x201C;plausible root causes&#x201D; <em>are</em> the true root causes - for instance, although DNA mutations could accumulate in principle, cells with certain <em>problematic</em> mutations are believed to be cleared out by the immune system - so the number of cells with these mutations is in equilibrium on a fast timescale, and cannot be a root cause of aging.</p><p>For any particular factor which changes with age, key questions are:</p><ol><li>Is it subject to homeostasis?</li><li>If so, on what timescale does it turn over?</li><li>If it is subject to homeostasis on a timescale faster than aging, then what are the production and removal mechanisms, and what changes the production and removal rates with age?</li></ol><p>These determine the applicability of the homeostasis argument. Typically, anything which can normally be fixed/replaced/undone by the body will be ruled out as a root cause of aging - the timescale of aging is very long compared to practically all other physiological processes.

These dynamics do not reliably fully take over until you have many levels of management. Questions of what causes high maze levels will be dealt with in future sections.</p><p>Again, if you have not yet done so, you are highly encouraged to read or review&nbsp;<a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2019/05/30/quotes-from-moral-mazes/"">Quotes from Moral Mazes</a>. I will not have the space here to even gloss over many important aspects.</p><p>An Immoral Maze can be modeled as a super-perfectly competitive job market for management material. All the principles of super-perfect competition are in play. The normal barriers to such competition have been stripped away. Too many ‘qualified’ managers compete for too few positions.</p><p>If an aspirant who does not devote everything they have, and visibly sacrifice all slack, towards success, they automatically fail. Those who do make such sacrifices mostly fail anyway, but some of them “succeed”. We’ll see later what success has in store for them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Lifestyle of a Middle Manager</strong></p><blockquote><p><i>At the managerial and professional levels, the road between work and life is usually open because it is difficult to refuse to use one’s influence, patronage, or power on behalf of another regular member of one’s social coterie. It therefore becomes important to choose one’s social colleagues with some care and, of course, know how to drop them should they fall out of organizational favor. (Moral Mazes, Location 884, Quote #117)</i></p></blockquote><p>We have this idea that there is work and there is not-work, and once one leaves work one is engaged in not-work distinct from work. We also have this idea that there are things that are off limits even at work, like sexual harassment.</p><p>For a person without anyone reporting to them, who is ‘on the line’ in the book’s parlance, this can be sustained.</p><p>For those in middle management who want to succeed, that’s not how things work. Everything you are is on the table. You’d better be all-in.&nbsp;</p><p>You will increasingly choose your friends to help you win. You will increasingly choose your hobbies, and what you eat, and your politics, and your house, and your church, and your spouse and how many kids you have, to help you win. And of course, you will choose your (lack of) morality.</p><p>In the end, you will sacrifice <i>everything, </i>and I mean everything, that you value, in any sense, to win.</p><p>If the job requires you to move, anywhere in the world, you’ll do it, dragging your nuclear family along and forcing all of you to leave behind everything and everyone you know. Otherwise, you’re just not serious about success.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/09/30/slack/"">Slack</a> will <i>definitely </i>not be a thing.</p><p>Your time is especially vulnerable.</p><blockquote><p><i>Higher-level managers in all the corporations I studied commonly spend twelve to fourteen hours a day at the office. (Location 1156, Quote #120, Moral Mazes)</i></p></blockquote><p>This is the result of total competition between producers – the managers are effectively rival producers trying to sell themselves as the product.&nbsp;</p><p>The market for managers is seen, by those who make the decisions, as highly efficient.</p><p>If managers were seen as wildly different in terms of talent, intelligence, or some other ability that helped get things done, that would help a lot. You could afford to be a little quirky, to hold on to the things you value most, without losing the game entirely. Your success will be&nbsp;<i>influenced&nbsp;</i>by your personality and dedication, but nothing like <i>solely determined&nbsp;</i>by them.</p><p>Alas, the perception in these mazes is exactly the opposite.</p><blockquote><p><i>See, once you are at a certain level of experience, the difference between a vice-president, an executive vice-president, and a general manager is negligible. It has relatively little to do with ability as such. People are all good at that level. They wouldn’t be there without that ability. So it has little to do with ability or with business experience and so on. All have similar levels of ability, drive, competence, and so on. What happens is that people perceive in others what they like—operating styles, lifestyles, personalities, ability to get along. Now these are all very subjective judgments. And what happens is that if a person in authority sees someone else’s guy as less competent than his own guy, well, he’ll always perceive him that way. And he’ll always pick—as a result—his own guy when the chance to do so comes up. (Location 1013, Quote #87, Moral Mazes)</i></p></blockquote><p>It is known that most people ‘don’t have what it takes’ to be a manager. This is clearly true on many levels. Only one of them is a willingness to fully get with the program.</p><p>Once you get several levels up, the default assumption is that everyone is smart enough, and competent enough. That the object-level is a fully level playing field. The idea that someone can just <i>be better at doing the actual job </i>doesn’t parse for them.</p><p>All remaining differences are about negative selection, about how hard you want it and are willing to sacrifice everything, or about how well you play political games. Nor do they much care whether you succeed at your job, anyway.</p><p>Some additional supporting quotes on that follow. A large portion of the quotes reinforce this perspective.&nbsp;</p><p>If you can’t work smart, work hard:</p><blockquote><p><i>When asked who gets ahead, an executive vice-president at Weft Corporation says: The guys who want it [get ahead]. The guys who work. You can spot it in the first six months. They work hard, they come to work earlier, they leave later. They have suggestions at meetings. They come into a business and the business picks right up. They don’t go on coffee breaks down here [in the basement]. You see the parade of people going back and forth down here? There’s no reason for that. I never did that. If you need coffee, you can have it at your desk. Some people put in time and some people work. (Location 992, Quote 29, Moral Mazes)</i></p></blockquote><p>But everyone at this level works hard, which was more about showing you work hard than the results of the work, because concrete outcomes don’t much matter:</p><blockquote><p><i>As one manager says: “Personality spells success or failure, not what you do on the field.” (Location 1383, Quote 33, Moral Mazes)</i></p></blockquote><p>It’s not like there were ever objective criteria:</p><blockquote><p><i>Managers rarely speak of objective criteria for achieving success because once certain crucial points in one’s career are passed, success and failure seem to have little to do with one’s accomplishments. (Location 917, Quote 42, Moral Mazes)</i></p></blockquote><p>Which makes sense, because if everyone is the same, then concrete outcomes are just luck:</p><blockquote><p><i>Assuming a basic level of corporate resources and managerial know-how, real economic outcome is seen to depend on factors largely beyond organizational or personal control. (Location 1592, Quote 46, Moral Mazes)</i></p></blockquote><p>I am supremely confident that this perspective is completely bonkers. There is huge differential between better and worse no matter how high up you go or how extreme your filters have already been. But <i>what matters here is what the managers believe. </i>Not what is true. Talent or brilliance won’t save you if no one believes it can exist. If noticed it will only backfire:</p><blockquote><p><i>Striking, distinctive characteristics of any sort, in fact, are dangerous in the corporate world. One of the most damaging things, for instance, that can be said about a manager is that he is brilliant. This almost invariably signals a judgment that the person has publicly asserted his intelligence and is perceived as a threat to others. What good is a wizard who makes his colleagues and his customers uncomfortable? (Location 1173, Quote 88, Moral Mazes)</i></p></blockquote><p>How do things get so bad?&nbsp;</p><p>That’s the question we’ll look at an aspect of next post. From here I anticipate 3-5 day gaps between posts.</p><p>Questions that will be considered later, worth thinking about now, include: How does this persist? If things are so bad, why aren’t things <i>way worse?</i> Why haven’t these corporations fallen apart or been competed out of business? Given they haven’t, why hasn’t the entire economy collapsed? Why do regular people, aspirant managers and otherwise, still think of these manager positions as the ‘good jobs’ as opposed to picking up pitchforks and torches?</p></body></html>",Zvi,zvi,Zvi,

It’s a controversial concept with important implications for designing agents that have optimal behavior when embedded in environments in which they may potentially interact with models of themselves. Unfortunately, I think that FDT is sometimes explained confusingly and misunderstood by its proponents and opponents alike. To help dissolve confusion about FDT and address key concerns of its opponents, I refute the criticism that FDT assumes that causation can happen backward in time and offer two key principles that provide a framework for clearly understanding it:</p><ol><li>Questions in decision theory are not questions about what choices you should make with some sort of unpredictable free will. They are questions about what type of source code you should be running. </li><li>I should consider predictor <em>P</em> to “subjunctively depend” on agent <em>A</em> to the extent that <em>P</em> makes predictions of <em>A</em>’s actions based on correlations that cannot be confounded by my choice of what source code <em>A</em> runs. </li></ol><h1>Getting Up to Speed</h1><p>I think that functional decision theory (FDT) is a beautifully counterintuitive and insightful framework for instrumental rationally. I will not make it my focus here to talk about what it is and what types of situations it is useful in. To gain a solid background, I recommend <u><a href=""https://medium.com/@thestephencasper/decision-theory-i-understanding-functional-decision-theory-2bef68d063b6"">this post of mine</a></u> or the <u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05060"">original paper on it</a></u> by Eliezer Yudkowsky and Nate Soares. </p><p>Additionally, here are four different ways that FDT can be explained. I find them all complimentary for understanding and intuiting it well.</p><ol><li>The decision theory that tells you to act as if you were setting the output to an optimal decision-making process for the task at hand.</li><li>The decision theory that has you cooperate in situations similar to a prisoners’ dilemma against a model of yourself--including when your opponent locks in their choice and shows it to you before you make yours. </li><li>The decision theory that has you one-box it in situations similar to <u><a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Newcomb's_problem"">Newcombian games</a></u>--including when the boxes are transparent; see also <u><a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Parfit's_hitchhiker"">Parfit’s Hitchhiker</a></u>. </li><li>The decision theory that shifts focus from what type of decisions you should make to what type of decision-making agent you should be. </li></ol><p>I’ll assume a solid understanding of FDT from here on. I’ll be arguing in favor of it, but it’s fairly controversial. Much of what inspired this post was an AI Alignment Forum post called <u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/ySLYSsNeFL5CoAQzN/a-critique-of-functional-decision-theory"">A Critique of Functional Decision Theory</a></u> by Will MacAskill which raised several objections to FDT. Some of his points are discussed below. The rest of this post will be dedicated to discussing two key principles that help to answer criticisms and dissolve confusions around FDT. </p><h1>1. Acknowledging One’s own Predictability</h1><p>Opponents of FDT, usually proponents of causal decision theory (CDT), will look at a situation such as the classic <u><a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Newcomb's_problem"">Newcombian game</a></u> and reason as so: </p><blockquote>I can choose to one-box it and take <em>A</em> or two-box it and take <em>A+B</em>. Regardless of  the value of <em>A, A+B</em> is greater, so it can only be rational to take both. After all, when I’m sitting in front of these boxes, what’s in them is already in them regardless of the choice I make. The functional decision theorist’s perspective requires assuming that causation can happen backwards in time! Sure, one-boxers might do better at these games, but non-smokers do better in <u><a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Smoking_lesion"">smoking lesion problems</a></u>. That doesn’t mean they are making the right decision. Causal decision theorists may be dealt a bad hand in Newcombian games, but it doesn’t mean they play it badly. </blockquote><p>The problem with this argument, I’d say, is subtle. I actually fully agree with the perspective that for causal decision theorists, Newcombian games are just like smoking lesion problems. I also agree with the point that causal decision theorists are dealt a bad hand in these games but don’t play it badly. The problem with the argument is some subtle confusion about the word ‘choice’ plus how it says that FDT assumes that causation can happen backwards in time.</p><p>The mistake that a causal decision theorist makes isn’t in two-boxing. It’s in being a causal decision theorist in the first place. In Newcombian games, the assumption that there is a highly-accurate predictor of you makes it clear that you are, well, predictable and not really making free choices. You’re just executing whatever source code you’re running. If this predictor thinks that you will two-box it, your fate is sealed and the best you can do is then to two-box it. The key is to just be running the right source code. And hence the first principle:</p><p><strong>Questions in decision theory are not questions about what choices you should make with some sort of unpredictable free will. They are questions about what type of source code you should be running. </strong></p><p>And in this sense, FDT is actually just what happens when you use causal decision theory to select what type of source code you want to enter a Newcombian game with. There’s no assumption that causation can occur backwards. FDT simply acknowledges that the source code you’re running can have a, yes, ***causal*** effect on what types of situations you will be presented with when models of you exist. FDT, properly understood, is a type of meta-causal theory. I, in fact, lament that FDT was named ""functional"" and not ""meta-causal.""</p><p>Instead of FDT assuming causal diagrams like these:</p><span><figure><img src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/v1676825700/mirroredImages/xoQRz8tBvsznMXTkt/pnnyhhy9rgpm86j4urqe.png"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:40%""></figure></span><p>It really only assumes ones like these:</p><span><figure><img src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/v1676825700/mirroredImages/xoQRz8tBvsznMXTkt/bvg5wflv00sadx5lcead.png"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:40%""></figure></span><p>I think that many proponents of FDT fail to make this point: FDT’s advantage is that it shifts the question to what type of agent you want to be--not misleading questions of what types of “choices” you want to make. But this isn’t usually how functional decision theorists explain FDT, including Yudkowsky and Soares in their <u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05060"">paper</a></u>. And I attribute some unnecessary confusion and misunderstandings like “FDT requires us to act as if causation happens backward in time,” to it. </p><p>To see this principle in action, let’s look at a situation presented by Will MacAskill. It’s similar to a Newcombian game with transparent boxes. And I say “similar” instead of “isomorphic” because of some vagueness which will be discussed soon. MacAskill presents this situation as follows:</p><blockquote>You face two open boxes, Left and Right, and you must take one of them. In the Left box, there is a live bomb; taking this box will set off the bomb, setting you ablaze, and you certainly will burn slowly to death. The Right box is empty, but you have to pay $100 in order to be able to take it. </blockquote><blockquote>A long-dead predictor predicted whether you would choose Left or Right, by running a simulation of you and seeing what that simulation did. If the predictor predicted that you would choose Right, then she put a bomb in Left. If the predictor predicted that you would choose Left, then she did not put a bomb in Left, and the box is empty. </blockquote><blockquote>The predictor has a failure rate of only 1 in a trillion trillion. Helpfully, she left a note, explaining that she predicted that you would take Right, and therefore she put the bomb in Left. </blockquote><blockquote>You are the only person left in the universe. You have a happy life, but you know that you will never meet another agent again, nor face another situation where any of your actions will have been predicted by another agent. What box should you choose? <em> </em></blockquote><p>Macaskill claims that you should take right because it results in a “guaranteed payoff”. Unfortunately, there is some vagueness here about what it means for a long-dead predictor to have run a simulation of you and for it to have an error rate of one in a trillion trillion. Is this simulation true to your actual behavior? What type of information about you did this long dead predictor have access to? What is the reference class for the error rate? </p><p>Let’s assume that your source code was written long ago, that the predictor understood how it functioned, that it ran a true-to-function simulation, and that you were given an unaltered version of that source code. Then this situation isomorphic to a transparent-box Newcombian game in which you see no money in box <em>A</em> (albeit more dramatic), and the confusion goes away! If this is the case then there are only two possibilities.</p><ol><li>You are a causal decision theorist (or similar), the predictor made a self-fulfilling prophecy by putting the bomb in the  left box alongside a note, and you will choose the right box. </li><li>You are a functional decision theorist (or similar), the predictor made an extremely rare, one in a trillion-trillion mistake, and you will unfortunately take the left box with a bomb (just as a functional decision theorist in a transparent box Newcombian game would take only box <em>A</em>).</li></ol><p>So what source code would you rather run when going into a situation like this? Assuming that you want to maximize expected value and that you don’t value your life at more than 100 trillion trillion dollars, then you want to be running the functional decision theorist’s source code. Successfully navigating this game, transparent-box Newcombian games, twin-opponent-reveals-first prisoners’ dilemmas, Parfit’s Hitchiker situations, and the like all require you have source code that would tell you to commit to making the suboptimal decision in the rare case in which the predictor/twin made a mistake. </p><p>Great! But what if we drop our assumptions? What if we don’t assume that this predictor’s simulation was functionally true to your behavior? Then it becomes unclear how this prediction was made, and what the reference class of agents is for which this predictor is supposedly only wrong one in a trillion trillion times. And this leads us to the second principle. </p><h1>2. When a Predictor is Subjunctively Entangled with an Agent</h1><p>An alternate title for this section could be “when statistical correlations are and aren’t mere.”</p><p>As established above, functional decision theorists need not assume that causation can happen backwards in time. Instead, they only need to acknowledge that a prediction and an action can both depend on an agent’s source code. This is nothing special whatsoever: an ordinary correlation between an agent and predictor that arises from a common factor: the source code. </p><p>However, Yudkowsky and Soares give this type of correlation a special name<em> </em>in their <u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05060"">paper</a></u>: <em>subjunctive dependence. </em>I don’t love this term because it gives a fancy name to something that is not fancy at all. I think this might be responsible for some of the confused criticism that FDT assumes that causation can happen backward in time. Nonetheless, “subjunctive dependence” is at least workable. Yudkowsky and Soares write:</p><p><em>When two physical systems are computing the same function, we will say that their behaviors “subjunctively depend” upon that function.</em></p><p>This concept is very useful when a predictor actually knows your source code and runs it to simulate you. However, this notion of subjunctive dependence isn’t very flexible and quickly becomes less useful when a predictor is not doing this. And this is a bit of a problem that MacAskill pointed out. A predictor could make good predictions without potentially querying a model of you that is functionally equivalent to your actions. He writes:</p><blockquote>...the predictor needn’t be running your algorithm, or have anything like a representation of that algorithm, in order to predict whether you’ll one box or two-box. Perhaps the Scots tend to one-box, whereas the English tend to two-box. Perhaps the predictor knows how you’ve acted prior to that decision. Perhaps the Predictor painted the transparent box green, and knows that’s your favourite colour and you’ll struggle not to pick it up. In none of these instances is the Predictor plausibly doing anything like running the algorithm that you’re running when you make your decision. But they are still able to predict what you’ll do. (And bear in mind that the Predictor doesn’t even need to be very reliable. As long as the Predictor is better than chance, a Newcomb problem can be created.)</blockquote><p>Here, I think that MacAskill is getting at an important point, but one that’s hard to see clearly with the wrong framework. On its face though, there’s a significant problem with this argument. Suppose that in Newcombian games, 99% of brown-eyed people one-boxed it, and 99% of blue-eyed people two-boxed it. If a predictor only made its prediction based on your eye color, then clearly the best source code to be running would be the kind that always made you two-box it regardless of your eye color. There’s nothing Newcombian, paradoxical, or even difficult about this case. And pointing out these situations is essentially how critics of MacAskill’s argument have answered it. Their counterpoint is that unless the predictor is querying a model of you that is functionally isomorphic to your decision making process, then it is only using “mere statistical correlations,” and subjunctive dependence does not apply.</p><p>But this counterpoint and Yudkoswky and Soares’ definition of subjunctive dependence miss something! MacAskill had a point. A predictor need not know an agent’s decision-making process to make predictions based on statistical correlations that are not “mere”. Suppose that you design some agent who enters an environment with whatever source code you gave it. Then if the agent’s source code is fixed, a predictor could exploit certain statistical correlations without knowing the source code. For example, suppose the predictor used observations of the agent to make probabilistic inferences about its source code. These could even be observations about how the agent acts in other Newcombian situations. Then the predictor could, without knowing what function the agent computes, make better-than-random guesses about its behavior. This falls outside of Yudkowsky and Soares’ definition of subjunctive dependence, but it has the same effect. </p><p>So now I’d like to offer my own definition of subjunctive dependence (even though still, I maintain that the term can be confusing, and I am not a huge fan of it). </p><p><strong>I should consider predictor <em>P</em> to “subjunctively depend” on agent <em>A</em> to the extent that <em>P</em> makes predictions of <em>A</em>’s actions based on correlations that cannot be confounded by my choice of what source code <em>A</em> runs. </strong></p><p>And hopefully, it’s clear why this is what we want. When we remember that questions in decision theory are really just questions about what type of source code we want to enter an environment using, then the choice of source code can only affect predictions that depend in some way on the choice of source code. If the correlation can’t be confounded by the choice of source code, the right kind of entanglement to allow for optimal updateless behavior is present. </p><h1>Additional Topics</h1><h2>Going Meta</h2><p>Consider what I call a <em>Mind Police </em>situation: Suppose that there is a powerful mind policing agent that is about to encounter agent <em>A</em> and read its mind (look at its source code). Afterward, if the mind policer judges <em>A</em> to be using decision theory <em>X</em>, they will destroy <em>A</em>. Else they will do nothing.</p><p>Suppose that decision theory <em>X</em> is FDT (but it could be anything) and that you are agent <em>A</em> who happens to use FDT. If you were given the option of overwriting your source code to implement some alternative, tolerated decision theory, would you? You’d be better off if you did, and it would be the output of an optimal function for the decision making task at hand, but it’s sort of unclear whether this is a very functional decision theorist thing to do. Because of situations like these, I think that we should consider decision theories to come in two flavors: <em>static </em>which will never overwrite itself, and <em>autoupdatable</em>, which might. </p><p>Also, note that the example above is only a first-order version of this type of problem, but there are higher-order ones too. For example, what if the mind police destroyed agents using autoupdatable decision theories?</p><h2>Why Roko’s Basilisk is Nonsense</h2><p>A naive understanding of FDT has led some people to ask whether a superintelligent sovereign, if one were ever developed, would be rational to torture everyone who didn’t help to bring it into existence. The <u><a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Roko's_basilisk"">idea</a></u> would be that this sovereign might consider this to be part of an updateless strategy to help it come into existence more quickly and accomplish its goals more effectively. </p><p>Fortunately, a proper understanding of subjunctive dependence tells us that an optimally-behaving <u><a href=""https://intelligence.org/embedded-agency/"">embedded agent</a></u> doesn’t need to pretend that causation can happen backward in time. Such a sovereign would not be in control of its source code, and it can’t execute an updateless strategy if there was nothing there to not-update on in the first place before that source code was written. So Roko’s Basilisk is only an information hazard if FDT is poorly understood. </p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>It's all about the source code. </p>",scasper,scasper,scasper,

otherwise use a check or other method with lower fees.  For example,
GiveWell 

<a href=""https://secure.givewell.org/"">writes</a>:



<blockquote>
We recommend that gifts up to $1,000 be made online by credit card. If
you are giving more than $1,000, please consider one of these
alternatives: Check, Bank Transfer, ...
</blockquote>



</p><p>

And the Against Malaria Foundation <a href=""https://www.againstmalaria.com/Donation.aspx"">writes</a>:

</p>

<blockquote>
However you prefer to make a donation is fine.<br />
All other things being equal, we prefer:
<ul>
<li>For donations less than US$5,000, an online donation using credit or
debit card</li>
<li>For donations more than US$5,000, an offline donation - by bank
transfer or by mail (cheque/check) - to eliminate fees.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>



<p>

This makes sense: if the charity is paying <a href=""https://www.againstmalaria.com/TransactionFees.aspx"">2.25%</a>
on your donation, that's $25 on a $1,000 donation, and $125 on a
$5,000 one.

</p>

<p>

The ideal, though, would to be able to donate with a credit card, get
credit card rewards, but still have the charity get the full amount.
I wouldn't expect this to exist, but it turns out that it does!

There
are platforms (ex: Facebook) which will cover the credit card fees for
charities, so that if you donate $1,000 the charity receives the full
$1,000.  Not only that, but your purchase is eligible for regular
credit card rewards, so 1-3% savings over sending a check.

</p>

</p><p>

The main downside of this approach is that you generally can't direct
your donation.  You can make a donation to the <a href=""https://www.malariaconsortium.org/"">Malaria Consortium</a>, but
not to their <a href=""https://www.givewell.org/charities/malaria-consortium"">Seasonal
Malaria Chemoprevention</a> program that GiveWell recommends.
Likewise, you can donate to the <a href=""https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/"">Centre for
Effective Altruism</a> but not <a href=""https://app.effectivealtruism.org/funds/ea-community"">a specific
EA fund</a>.

</p>

<p>

Again, however, there is an exception: the <a href=""https://www.eagivingtuesday.org/"">EA Giving Tuesday</a> team has
been coordinating with EA charities to create FB fundraisers for
specific programs.  At least for 2019 these were only open for a
couple weeks leading up to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giving_Tuesday"">Giving
Tuesday</a>, but during that window you could use your credit card for
no-fee donations to specific programs at EA charities.  Potentially
the EA Giving Tuesday folks should advertise this as something to use
their fundraisers for, and keep them open a bit longer in December?

</p>

<p>EDIT: Avi, from the EA Giving Tuesday group, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/jefftk/posts/10100130377653972?comment_id=10100130488272292"">doesn't think this is a good idea</a>.</p>

<p>

There could also be other opportunities available on short notice.  For
example, we could find out in November 2020 that there's something
like the <a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/paypal-giving-fund"">1% PayPal Giving Fund</a>
match that was offered in 2017 and 2018.  Because these can appear on
short notice, I think it's worth trying to have sufficient credit
across multiple cards that you could potentially run your annual
donations all through your open credit cards on a single day.

</p>

<p>

The two main ways to increase your available credit are opening new
credit cards and asking for credit limit increases on your existing
cards.  For limit increases there's generally a link in the online
banking UI like ""Request a Credit Limit Increase"".  Typically it will
bring up a form with fields for annual income and monthly
mortgage/rent:

</p>

<p>

<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/citi-double-cash-credit-limit-increase-big.png""><img src=""https://www.jefftk.com/citi-double-cash-credit-limit-increase.png"" srcset=""https://www.jefftk.com/citi-double-cash-credit-limit-increase.png 550w, https://www.jefftk.com/citi-double-cash-credit-limit-increase-2x.png 1100w"" /></a>

</p>

<p>

I went through my cards yesterday and asked for 100% limit
increases on each.  Here's what happened:

</p>

<table>
<tr>
<td>Citi Double Cash (2%)</td>
<td>Got +45%, immediately
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Capital One Quicksilver (1.5%)</td>
<td>Got +6%
immediately
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Barclays jetBlue (~1.5% equivalent)</td>
<td>Got +100%, by email the
next day
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Alliant Cashback (2.5%)</td>
<td>Couldn't find a link for requesting
an increase; I should probably call them.
</td>
</tr>
</table>



<p>

In 2019 I was able to run about 80% of our donations through credit
cards, which was worth about $3k in rewards.

</p>

<p>

If your goal is to get rich, donating money, even with tax deductions
and credit card rewards, is not going to help.  But for money
you're donating anyway, ~2% savings is worth optimizing a bit for.

<p>The English is a bit dated; Walter Raleigh (probably) wrote it in 1592 (probably). ""Give the lie"" here is an <a href=""https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/give_the_lie_to"">expression meaning</a> ""accuse them of lying"" (<em>not</em> ""tell them this specific lie"", as modern readers not familiar with the expression might interpret it).</p>
<p>The speaker is telling his soul to go to all of Society's respected institutions and reveal that the stories they tell about themselves are false: the court's shining standard of Justice is really about as shiny as a decaying stump; the chruch teaches what's good but doesn't do any good; kings think they're so powerful and mighty, but are really just the disposable figurehead of a coalition; <em>&amp;c.</em> (I'm not totally sure exactly what <em>all</em> of the stanzas mean because of the dated language, but I feel OK about this.)</p>
<p>The speaker realizes this campaign is kind of suicidal (""Go, since I needs must die"") and will probably result in getting stabbed. That's why he's telling his soul to do it, because—ha-ha!—immaterial souls can't be stabbed!</p>

<p>In this post I'd basically like to collect some underappreciated points about utility functions that I've made in the comments of various places but which I thought were collecting into a proper, easily-referenceable post.  The first part will review the different things referred to by the term ""utility function"", review how they work, and explain the difference between them.  The second part will explain why -- contrary to widespread opinion on this website -- decision-theoretic utility functions really do need to be bounded.</p>
<p>(It's also worth noting that as a consequence, a number of the decision-theoretic ""paradoxes"" discussed on this site simply <strong>are not problems</strong> since they rely on unbounded decision-theoretic utility.  An example is <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/a5JAiTdytou3Jg749/pascal-s-mugging-tiny-probabilities-of-vast-utilities"">the original Pascal's Mugging</a> (yes, I realize that term has since been applied to a bunch of things that have nothing to do with unbounded utility, but I mean the original problem).)</p>
<p>Anyway.  Let's get on with it.</p>
<h2>Part 1: ""Utility function"" refers to two different things that are often conflated and you should be sure you know which one you're talking about</h2>
<p>The term ""utility function"" refers to two significantly different, but somewhat related, things, which are, due to the terminological and conceptual overlap, often conflated.  This results in a lot of confusion.  So, I want to cover the distinction here.</p>
<p>The two things called utility functions are:</p>
<ol>
<li>A function that describes the preferences of a given agent, assuming that agent's preferences satisfy certain rationality conditions, and which does not depend on any particular ethical theory, but rather is useful in decision theory and game theory more generally.   If I need to be unambiguous, I'll call this a <em>decision-theoretic utility function</em>.</li>
<li>A function, used specifically in utilitarianism, that describes something like a person's preferences or happiness or something -- it's never been clearly defined, and different versions of utilitarianism suggest different ideas of what it should look like; these are then somehow aggregated over all people into an overall (decision-theoretic!) utility function (which is treated as if it were the decision-theoretic utility function describing what an ideal moral agent would do, rather than the preferences of any particular agent).  If I need to be unambiguous, I'll call this an <em>E-utility</em> function.</li>
</ol>
<p>(There's actually a third thing sometimes called a ""utility function"", which also gets confused with these other two, but this is a rarer and IMO less important usage; I'll get back to this in a bit.)</p>
<p>It's important to note that much discussion online conflates all of these and yields nonsense as a result.  If you see someone talking nonsense about utility functions, before replying, it's worth asking -- are they mixing together different definitions of ""utility function""?</p>
<p>So.  Let's examine these in a bit more detail.</p>
<h3>Decision-theoretic utility functions and their assumptions</h3>
<p>Decision-theoretic utility functions describe the preferences of any consequentialist agent satisfying certain rationality conditions; by ""it describes the agent's preferences"", I mean that, given a choice between two options, the one yielding the higher expected utility is the one the agent chooses.</p>
<p>It's not obvious in advance that a rational agent's preferences need to be described by a utility function, but there are theorems guaranteeing this; <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5J34FAKyEmqKaT7jt/a-summary-of-savage-s-foundations-for-probability-and"">Savage's theorem</a> probably provides the best foundation for this, although the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann%E2%80%93Morgenstern_utility_theorem"">VNM theorem</a> may be a little more familiar.  (We'll discuss the difference between these two in more detail in the quick note below and discuss it further in the second part of this post.)  Note that these functions are not <em>entirely</em> unique -- see below.  Also note that these are conditions of rationality under <em>uncertainty</em>.</p>
<p>Again, a decision-theoretic utility function simply describes an agent's preferences.  It has nothing to do with any particular idea of morality, such as utilitarianism.  Although you could say -- as I've said above -- that it assumes a consequentialist agent, who cares only about consequences.  So, any rational consequentialist agent has a decision-theoretic utility function; but only a utilitarian would admit the existence of E-utility functions.  (While this doesn't <em>exactly</em> bear on the point here, it is worth noting that utilitarianism is a specific type of consequentialism and not identical with it!)</p>
<p>Note that real people will not actually obey the required rationality assumptions and thus will not actually have decision-theoretic utility functions; nonetheless, idealized rational agents, and therefore decision-theoretic utility functions, are a useful abstraction for a number of purposes.</p>
<p>Decision-theoretic utility functions are usually stated as taking values in the real numbers, but they're only defined up to positive affine transformations (scaling by a positive constant, and translation); applying such a transformation to a utility function for an agent will yield another, equally-valid utility function.  As such they may be better thought of not as taking values in <strong>R</strong>, exactly, but rather a sort of ordered 1-dimensional affine space over <strong>R</strong>.  Outputs of a decision-theoretic utility function are not individually meaningful; in order to get meaningful numbers, with concrete meaning about the agent's preferences, one must take ratios of utilities, (a-b)/|c-d|.  (Note the absolute value in the denominator but not the numerator, due to the importance of order.)</p>
<p>Decision-theoretic utility functions really need to be bounded -- a point seriously underappreciated on this website -- but I'll save discussion of that for the second part of this post.</p>
<h4>A quick tangential note on probability and additivity</h4>
<p>This is pretty tangential to the point of this post, but it's probably worth taking the time here to explain what the difference is between the Savage and VNM formalisms.  (Well, one of two differences; the other will be discussed in the second part of this post, but as we'll see it's actually <em>not</em> such a difference.)  The main difference is that the VNM theorem assumes that we already believe in the idea of probability -- it justifies decision-theoretic utility, but it does nothing to justify probability, it just assumes it.  Savage's theorem, by contrast, provides a foundation for both probability and decision-theoretic utility simultaneously, based on just on rationality axioms about preferences, which is why I think it's the better foundation.</p>
<p>However, the probability measure it constructs need not actually be a probability measure as such, as it need only be finitely additive rather than countably additive.  It's not clear what to make of this.  Maybe countable additivity of probability just isn't necessary for a rational agent?  It's hard to say.  (If I'm not mistaken, the limiting probabilities of MIRI's logical inductor are merely (the analogue of) finitely additive, not countably additive, but I could be wrong about that...) But this is really off the point, so I'm just going to raise the question and then move on; I just wanted to mention it to ward off nitpicks on this point.  As we'll see below, the choice of formalism doesn't actually matter much to my point here.</p>
<h3>E-utility functions and their assumptions</h3>
<p>This is the older meaning of the term if I'm not mistaken, but there is <em>mostly</em> not a lot to say about these because they're fairly ill-defined.  They are, as mentioned above, specifically a utilitarian notion (<em>not</em> a general consequentialist notion).  How to define these, as well as how to aggregate them, remain disputed.</p>
<p>Utilitarians say that one should try to maximize the expected value of the aggregated utility function, which means that the aggregated function is actually a weird sort of decision-theoretic utility function (corresponding to an ideal moral agent rather than any particular agent), not an E-utility function.  One does not attempt to maximize expected value of E-utility functions.</p>
<p>One thing we <em>can</em> say about E-utility functions is that while only idealized rational agents have decision-theoretic utility functions and not real people, real people <em>are</em> supposed to have E-utility functions.  Or at least so I gather, or else I don't see how utilitarianism makes sense?</p>
<p>Actually, one could say that it is not only utilitarians who rely on these -- there is also the notion of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prioritarianism"">prioritarianism</a>; one sometimes sees the term ""aggregative consequentialism"" to cover both of these (as well as other potential variants).  But, because E-utility functions are so ill-defined, there is, as best I can tell, not really any meaningful distinction between the two.  For example, consider a utilitarian theory that assigns to each agent p a real-valued E-utility function U_p, and aggregates them by summing.  Let's suppose further that each U_p takes values in the nonnegative reals; then if we change the aggregation rule to summing the square roots of the U_p, we have changed our utilitarian theory into a prioritarian one.  Except, instead of doing that, we could define U'_p = sqrt(U_p), and call U'_p the E-utilities; because there's no precise definition of E-utilities, there's nothing stopping us from doing this.  But then the utilitarian theory described by the U'_p, describes exactly the same theory as the prioritarian theory described by the U_p!  The theory could equally well be described as ""utilitarian"" or ""prioritarian""; for this reason, unless one puts further restrictions on E-utility functions, I do not consider there to be any meaningful difference between the two.</p>
<p>As such, throughout this post I simply say ""utilitarianism"" rather than ""aggregative consequentialism""; but if I'm wrong in identifying the two, well, whenever I say ""utilitarianism"" I really kind of mean ""aggregative consequentialism"".  Hope that's OK.</p>
<h3>Preference utilitarianism and Harsanyi's theorem (using decision-theoretic utility functions as E-utility functions)</h3>
<p>Above I've made a point of emphasizing that decision-theoretic utility and E-utility functions are different things.  But could there be cases where it makes sense to use one as the other?  Specifically, to use decision-theoretic utility functions as E-utility functions?  (The reverse clearly doesn't make much sense.)</p>
<p>Well, yes, that's basically what preference utilitarianism is!  OK, precise formulations of preference utilitarianism may vary, but the idea is to use people's preferences as E-utility functions; and how are you going to encode people's preferences if not with decision-theoretic utility functions?  (OK, this may only really work for a population of idealized agents, but it's still worth thinking about.)</p>
<p>Indeed, we can go further and formalize this with <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/z8afQRsH9wWsB4iMD/harsanyi-s-social-aggregation-theorem-and-what-it-means-for"">Harsanyi's theorem</a>, which gives a series of moral assumptions (note: among them is that the agents in the population do indeed have decision-theoretic utility functions!) under which morality does indeed come down to maximizing a sort of aggregate of the population's decision-theoretic utility functions.</p>
<p>(Note that it also assumes that the population is fixed, which arguably assumes away a lot of the hard parts of utilitarianism, but it's still a useful starting point.)</p>
<p>But, what is this aggregation?  If we think of the agent's utility functions as taking values in <strong>R</strong>, as they're usually thought of, then the aggregation consists of summing <em>a</em> utility function for each agent.  But which one?  As mentioned above, utility functions are only unique up to positive affine transformations.  Harsanyi's theorem provides no guidance on <em>which</em> utility function to use for each agent -- how could it?  They're all equally valid.  And yet using different ones can yield very different (and <em>meaningfully</em> different) aggregated results, essentially letting you adjust weightings between agents!  Except there's no meaningful notion of ""equal weighting"" to use as baseline.  It's something of a problem.</p>
<p>(This is often discussed in terms of ""weights"", coefficients put in front of the utility functions; but I think this obscures the fundamental issue, in making it sound like there's a meaningful notion of ""equal weights"" when there really isn't.)</p>
<p>Still, despite these holes, preference utilitarianism and Harsanyi's theorem are definitely worth thinking about.</p>
<h3>Brief note on that third sort of utility function</h3>
<p>Finally, before we get to the second part of this post, I wanted to mention that third thing sometimes called a ""utility function"".</p>
<p>The term ""utility function"" is sometimes used for a real-valued function that describe's an agents <em>deterministic</em> preferences; i.e., if A and B are two options, and U the utility function, then the agent prefers A to B if and only if U(A) &gt; U(B).  Note the lack of any requirement here about expected value!  This is a weaker sense than a decision-theoretic utility function as I described it above; any decision-theoretic utility function is one of these, but not vice-versa.</p>
<p>While you'll occasionally encounter this, it's frankly a useless and even counterproductive notion.  Why?  Because fundamentally, it's <em>the wrong abstraction for the situation</em>.  If uncertainty isn't coming into play, and you're only applying deterministic rationality constraints, then the right structure for describing an agent's preferences is a total preorder.  Why would you introduce real numbers?  That just restricts what you can express!  Not every total preorder will embed in the real numbers.  So, there isn't any sensible set of rationality conditions that will lead to this notion of utility function; they'll lead you instead to the idea of a total preorder, and then oops maybe that total preorder will fail to embed in <strong>R</strong> and the agent won't have a ""utility function"" in this sense.</p>
<p>Such a function is of course only unique up to order-preserving functions on <strong>R</strong>, meaning it's not very unique at all (one more sign of it being the wrong abstraction).</p>
<p>Why were such functions ever even used, when they're clearly the wrong abstraction?  I think basically it's because a lot of people lack familiarity with mathematical structures, or how to build an abstraction to suit a set of requirements, and instead tend to just immediately reach for the real numbers as a familiar setting to put things in.  (Honestly, that's probably why decision-theoretic utility functions were initially defined as <strong>R</strong>-valued as well; fortunately, in that case, it turns out to be the correct choice!  The real numbers can indeed be quite useful...)</p>
<p>Of course, as discussed above, if your agent not only obeys requirements of deterministic rationality, but also requirements of rationality under uncertainty, then in fact they'll have a decision-theoretic utility function, taking values in <strong>R</strong>, and so will have one of these.  So in that sense the assumption of taking these values in <strong>R</strong> is harmless.  But still...</p>
<h2>Part 2: Yes, decision-theoretic utility functions really do need to be bounded</h2>
<p>OK.  Now for the main point: Contrary to widespread opinion on this site, decision-theoretic utility functions really do need to be bounded.</p>
<p>First, I'm going to discuss this in terms of <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5J34FAKyEmqKaT7jt/a-summary-of-savage-s-foundations-for-probability-and"">Savage's theorem</a>.  I realize this is the less familiar formalism for many here, but I think it's the better one; if you're not familiar with it I recommend reading my post on it.  I'll discuss the point in terms of the more familiar VNM formalism shortly.</p>
<p>OK.  So under Savage's formalism, well, Savage's theorem tells us that (under Savage's rationality constraints) decision-theoretic utility functions must be bounded.  Um, OK, hm, that's not a very helpful way of putting it, is it?  Let's break this down some more.</p>
<p>There's one specific axiom that guarantees the boundedness of utility functions: Savage's axiom P7.  Maybe we don't need axiom P7?  Is P7 really an important rationality constraint?  It seems intuitive enough, like a constraint any rational agent should obey -- what rational agent could possibly violate it? -- but maybe we can do without it?</p>
<p>Let's hold that thought and switch tracks to the VNM formalism instead.  I mean -- why all this discussion of Savage at all?  Maybe we prefer the VNM formalism.  <em>That</em> doesn't guarantee that utility functions are bounded, right?</p>
<p>Indeed, as usually expressed, the VNM formalism doesn't guarantee that utility functions are bounded... except the usual VNM formalism doesn't actually prove that utility functions do everything we want!</p>
<p>The point of a decision-theoretic utility function is that it describes the agent's preferences under uncertainty; given two gambles A and B, the one with the higher expected utility (according to the function) is the one the agent prefers.</p>
<p>Except, the VNM theorem doesn't actually prove this for arbitrary gambles!  It only proves it for gambles with finitely many possible outcomes.  What if we're comparing two gambles and one of them has infinitely many possible outcomes?  This is something utility functions are often used for on this site, and a case I think we really do need to handle -- I mean, <em>anything</em> could potentially have infinitely many possible outcomes, couldn't it?</p>
<p>Well, in this case, the VNM theorem by itself provides <em>absolutely no guarantee</em> that higher expected utility actually describes the agent's preference!  Our utility function might simply <em>not work</em> -- might simply fail to correctly describe the agent's preference -- once gambles with infintely many outcomes are involved!</p>
<p>Hm.  How troublesome.  OK, let's take another look at Savage and his axiom P7.  What happens if we toss that out?  There's no longer anything guaranteeing that utility functions are bounded.  But also, there's no longer anything guaranteeing that the utility function works when comparing gambles with infinitely many outcomes!</p>
<p>Sounds familiar, doesn't it?  Just like with VNM.  If you don't mind a utility function that might fail to correctly describe your agent's preferences once infinite gambles get involved, then sure, utility functions can be unbounded.  But, well, that's really not something we can accept -- we <em>do</em> need to be able to handle such cases; or at least, such cases are often discussed on this site.  Which means bounded utility functions.  There's not really any way around it.</p>
<p>And if you're still skeptical of Savage, well, this all has an analogue in the VNM formalism too -- you can add additional conditions to guarantee that the utility function continues to work even when dealing with infinite gambles, but you end up proving in addition that the utility function is bounded.  I'm not so familiar with this, so I'll just point to <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/8FRzErffqEW9gDCCW/against-the-linear-utility-hypothesis-and-the-leverage#PPETmeK428RMQJgzY"">this old comment</a> by AlexMennen for that...</p>
<p>Anyway, point is, it doesn't really matter which formalism you use -- either you accept that utility functions are bounded, or you give up on the idea that utility functions produce meaningful results in the face of infinite gambles, and, as I've already said, the second of these is not acceptable.</p>
<p>Really, the basic reason should go through regardless of the particular formalism; you can't have both unbounded utility functions, and meaningful expected utility comparisons for infinite gambles, because, while the details will depend on the particular formalism, you can get contradictions by considering St. Petersburg-like scenarios.  For instance, in Savage's formalism, you could set up two St. Petersburg-like gambles A and B such that the agent necessarily prefers A to B but also necessarily is indifferent between them; forcing the conclusion that in fact the agent's utility function must have been bounded, preventing this setup.</p>
<p>I'd like to note here a consequence of this I already noted in the intro -- a number of the decision-theoretic ""paradoxes"" discussed on this site simply <strong>are not problems</strong> since they rely on unbounded decision-theoretic utility.  An example is <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/a5JAiTdytou3Jg749/pascal-s-mugging-tiny-probabilities-of-vast-utilities"">the original Pascal's Mugging</a>; yes, I realize that term has since been applied to a bunch of things that have nothing to do with unbounded utility, but the original problem, the one Yudkowsky was actually concerned with, crucially does.</p>
<p>And I mean, it's often been noted before that these paradoxes go away if bounded utility is assumed, but the point I want to make is stronger -- that the only reason these ""paradoxes"" seem to come up at all is because contradictory assumptions are being made!  That utility functions can be unbounded, <em>and</em> that utility functions work for infinite gambles.  One could say ""utility functions have to be bounded"", but from a different point of view, one could say ""expected utility is meaningless for infinite gambles""; <em>either</em> of these would dissolve the problem, it's only insisting that <em>neither</em> of these are acceptable that causes the conflict.  (Of course, the second really is unacceptable, but that's another matter.)</p>
<h3>Does normalization solve the weighting problem? (I wouldn't bet on it)</h3>
<p>One interesting note about bounded utility functions is that it suggests a solution to the weighting problem discussed above with Harsanyi's theorem; notionally, one could use boundedness to pick a canonical normalization -- e.g., choosing everyone's utility function to have infimum 0 and supremum 1.  I say it <em>suggests</em> a solution rather than that it <em>provides</em> a solution, however, in that I've seen nothing to suggest that there's any reason one should actually do that other than it just seeming nice, which, well, is not really a very strong reason for this sort of thing.  While I haven't thought too much about it, I'd bet someone can come up with an argument as to why this is actually a really bad idea.</p>
<p>(And, again, this would still leave the problem of population ethics, as well as many others, but still, in this idealized setting...)</p>
<h3>Some (bad) arguments against boundedness</h3>
<p>Finally, I want to take a moment here to discuss some arguments against boundedness that have come up here.</p>
<p>Eliezer Yudkowsky has argued against this (I can't find the particular comment at the moment, sorry) basically on the idea of that total utilitarianism in a universe that can contain arbitrarily many people requires unbounded utility functions.  Which I suppose it does.  But, to put it simply, <strong>if your ethical assumptions contradict the mathematics, it's not the mathematics that's wrong</strong>.</p>
<p>That's being a bit flip, though, so let's examine this in more detail to see just where the problem is.</p>
<p>Eliezer would point out that <a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/The_utility_function_is_not_up_for_grabs"">the utility function is not up for grabs</a>.  To which I can only say, yes, exactly -- except that this way of formulating it is slightly less than ideal.  We should say instead, <em>preferences</em> are not up for grabs -- utility functions merely encode these, remember.  But if we're stating idealized preferences (including a moral theory), then these idealized preferences had better be consistent -- and not literally just consistent, but obeying rationality axioms to avoid stupid stuff.  Which, as already discussed above, means they'll correspond to a bounded utility function.  So if your moral theory is given by an <em>unbounded</em> utility function, then it is <em>not</em>, in fact, a correct description of anyone's idealized preferences, no matter how much you insist it is, because you're saying that people's idealized (not real!) preferences are, essentially, inconsistent.  (I mean, unless you claim that it's not supposed to be valid for infinite gambles, in which case it can I suppose be correct within its domain of applicability, but it won't be a complete description of your theory, which will need some other mechanism to cover those cases; in particular this means your theory will no longer be utilitarian, if that was a goal of yours, and so in particular will not be total-utilitarian.)</p>
<p>One could question whether the rationality constraints of Savage (or VNM, or whatever) really apply to an aggregated utility function -- above I claimed this should be treated as a decision-theoretic utility function, but is this claim correct? -- but I think we have to conclude that they do for the same reason that they apply to preferences of ideal agents, i.e., they're supposed to be a consistent set of preferences; an incosistent (or technically consistent but having obvious perversities) moral system is no good.  (And one could imagine, in some idealized world, one's ethical theory being programmed as the preferences of an FAI, so...)</p>
<p>Basically the insistence on unbounded utility functions strikes me as, really, backwards reasoning -- the sort of thing that only makes sense if one <em>starts</em> with the idea of maximizing expected utility (and maybe not distinguishing too strongly between the two different things called ""utility functions""), rather than if one starts from agents' actual <em>preferences</em> and the rationality constraints these must obey.  If one remembers that utility functions are merely meant to describe preferences that obey rationality constraints, there's no reason you'd ever want them to be unbounded; the math rules this out.  If one reasons backwards, however, and <em>starts</em> with the idea of utility functions, it seems like a harmless little variant (it isn't).  So, I'd like to encourage everyone reading this to beware of this sort of backwards thinking, and to remember that the primary thing is agents' preferences, and that good rationality constraints are directly interpretable in terms of these.  Whereas ""the agent has a decision-theoretic utility function""... what does that mean, concretely?  Why are there real numbers involved, where did those come from?  These are a lot of very strong assumptions to be making with little reason!  Of course, there are good reason to believe these strong-sounding claims, such as the use of real numbers specifically; but they make sense as <em>conclusions</em>, not assumptions.</p>
<h4>Tangential note about other formalisms (or: I have an axe to grind, sorry)</h4>
<p>One final tangential note: Eliezer Yudkowsky has occasionally claimed here that probability and decision-theoretic utility should be grounded not in Savage's theorem but rather in the complete class theorem (thus perhaps allowing unbounded utilities, despite the reasons above the particular formalism shouldn't matter?), but the <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CPP2uLcaywEokFKQG/toolbox-thinking-and-law-thinking#tGxo94F3cZDKPSM7x"">arguments he has presented for this</a> do not make any sense to me and as best I can tell contain a number of claims that are simply incorrect.  Like, obviously, the complete class theorem cannot provide a foundation for probability, when it already assumes a notion of probability; I may be mistaken but it looks to me like it assumes a notion of decision-theoretic utility as well; and his claims about it requiring weaker assumptions than Savage's theorem are not only wrong but likely exactly backwards.  Apologies for grinding this axe here, but given how this has come up here before I thought it was necessary.  Anyway, see <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/RQpNHSiWaXTvDxt6R/coherent-decisions-imply-consistent-utilities#YfjqHzdtgPpDLK9S3"">previous discussion</a> on this point, not going to discuss it more here.  (Again, sorry for that.)</p>
<h2>Conclusion?</h2>
<p>Anyway I hope this has clarified the different things meant by the term ""utility function"", so you can avoid getting these mixed up in the future, and if you see confused discussion of them you can come in and de-confuse the issue.</p>
<p>...and yes, decision-theoretic utility functions really do need to be bounded.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum</strong> May 9th: I should note, if for some reason you really want to bite the bullet and instead say, OK, utility functions don't apply to choices with infinitely many possible outcomes, then, well, I think that's silly, but it is consistent.  But what I want to make clear here is that doing both that <em>and</em> insisting utility functions should be unbounded -- which is what you need for ""paradoxes"" as discussed above to come up -- is just inconsistent; you are at the least going to need to pick <em>one</em> of the horns of the dilemma.</p>

Two years ago I decided I was going to start

Initially I was very interested in getting faster, and would time
myself a couple days a week, trying to beat my previous best:

Unfortunately, after six months I was pushing myself too hard, and my
knees started hurting.  I stopped timing my runs and stopped running
so hard, and they got better again.  I'm still running, but at a
gentler pace.

This experience was a good illustration of how optimizing for a metric
can often bring you towards your overall goals for a while, but then
continuing to optimize on it can start to bring you away from them
again.

When I touch my pectoral muscles, I can feel lumps. I have been suffering unbearable anxiety for the past one year and a haf or so, feeling that something very wrong is happening.</p><p><strong>Medical Evidence</strong> One year ago,  a cardiologist told me my heart was fine and didn&apos;t see anything from ultrasound. In the past two months, I checked two GPs. The first one said &quot;it&apos;s probably just muscular&quot;. The second one (extremely talented, known as Dr. House) recommended additional ultrasound/computed tomography.</p><p><strong>Internal Evidence</strong> It feels real. It hurts. It&apos;s cumbersome. It affects the left part of my chest and my left arm. Whenever I touch it I can feel that my left chest is of a very different consistency compared to my right one.</p><p><strong>What happens</strong> I can&apos;t do any meaningful work. My mind is immersed in daily pain and the possibility of a final stage cancer. When I think about doing the additional tests, I&apos;m TERRIFIED by the idea of having a doctor tell me &quot;you have 4 months left&quot;. Yesterday, I managed to make an appointment for an ultrasound. However, I&apos;m broke, and it turns out that the particular doctor is really expensive and has really bad reputation online (3/5 google reviews) so I ended up canceling it this morning. Also, I spend a lot of time in self-loathing, insulting myself for not having done any medical exams sooner, when the disease was &quot;not yet deadly&quot;.</p><p><strong>What I tell myself when I&apos;m trying to be more rational</strong> I check the actual statistics of having some kind of cancer in my left chest. For males, breast cancer is 100 times less likely than females. I&apos;m in my 20s, so the probability of having a cancer is smaller than for old people. When I look at actual symptoms of breast cancer, I have none.  Most importantly, after checking actual cancer statistics, there&apos;s the chance of having a thing and still surviving (probability depends on the type of cancer and stage).</p><p>Also, I&apos;ve been feeling pain for about one year and a half. So if it was something like a cancer, the actual pain would only appear at end, and wouldn&apos;t keep on going for a year. Plus, Dr. House not being impressed by my lumps is some evidence that they are not so impressive. And when I touch my right chest, I can also feel weird things when I search enough. The pain in the left chest could be something a psychosomatic phenomenon (at least to some degree).</p><p><strong>What I actually tell myself</strong> I&apos;m dead. The lumps are actually there. Look, when you press here you can feel this really strange thing. It&apos;s gross. It&apos;s getting worse and worse. It&apos;s very large. Oh my god it&apos;s a final stage cancer. I won&apos;t survive. I&apos;m such a piece of shit for not having gone to a doctor. It&apos;s been over a year. Fuck. I should be doing more tests. But I&apos;m broke. And the outcome of doing more tests will be one of the following:</p><p>1. The doctors are not able to identify my disease and I&apos;ll keep being in pain / anxious / dying.</p><p>2. They identify something and tell me &quot;you have four months to live&quot;.</p><p><strong>What I&apos;m asking you</strong> I need help. I know most of what I think doesn&apos;t make sense, but it <strong>FEELS</strong> very real. It&apos;s like having some really strong internal evidence that something bad is happening. I know that doing more tests if the way to go. But because it takes 2-3 weeks to get an appointement for a good GP, so there&apos;s always the bias of trying to avoid to think about death and procrastinating the appointment. And there&apos;s this additional cost of having to borrow money to do any test to begin with, which is painful to think about.</p><p><strong>In short </strong>It feels like I&apos;m Pascal Mugging myself when thinking about death. But I&apos;m also the complete opposite of a hypochodriac that would go see a ton of doctor because he is in distress. I <strong>FEAR </strong>going to a doctor because I&apos;m afraid he will either not find anything or tell me I&apos;m dead.

<p>This is a follow-up to the 2017 blog post <a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/09/12/toward-a-predictive-theory-of-depression/"">Slate Star Codex: Toward a Predictive Theory of Depression</a>. I think that post has fundamentally the right idea, but that it had some pieces of the puzzle that didn't quite fit satisfyingly.</p>
<p>Well I personally have no special knowledge about depression (happily!), but I have thought an awful lot about the how predictive coding, motivation, and emotions interact in the brain. So I think that I can flesh out Scott's basic story and make it more complete, coherent and plausible. Here goes!</p>
<p>Let's start with my cartoon of predictive coding as I see it:</p>
<p><img src=""https://sjbyrnes.com/LW_PC_RL_SSL.png"" alt=""""></p>
<p>For lots of details and discussion and caveats, see <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/cfvBm2kBtFTgxBB7s/predictive-coding-rl-sl-bayes-mpc"">Predictive coding = RL + SL + Bayes + MPC</a>.</p>
<p>In fact, don't bother reading on here until you've read that.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>... done? OK, let's move on.</p>
<p>One more piece of background: In predictive coding, hypotheses have a ""strength"" term for the various predictions they make—basically, the confidence that this prediction will come true. If a strong prediction is erroneous, that's likelier to rise to attention, and to cause the offending hypothesis to be discarded or modified. So let's say you have the hypothesis:</p>
<p><em>Hypothesis: The thing I am looking at is a TV screen showing static.</em></p>
<p>This hypothesis...</p>
<ul>
<li>...makes weak predictions about visual inputs within the screen area (where there's static),</li>
<li>...makes strong predictions about visual inputs within the thin black frame of the TV,</li>
<li>...makes infinitely weak (strength-zero) predictions of sensations coming from my foot.</li>
</ul>
<p>The sensations from my foot are just not part of this hypothesis. Thus a separate hypothesis about my foot—say, that my foot is tapping the floor and will continue to do so—can be active simultaneously, and these two hypotheses won't conflict.</p>
<p><strong>The proposed grand unified theory of depression in this post is the same as in <a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/09/12/toward-a-predictive-theory-of-depression/"">Scott's post</a>: Severe depression is when all the brain's hypotheses make anomalously weak predictions</strong></p>
<p>I'm now going to go through the symptoms of depression listed in Scott's article, plus a couple others he left out:</p>
<h1>Perception</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>... Depressed people describe the world as gray, washed-out, losing its contrast.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This one is just like Scott says. Normally we understand an apple via a hypothesis like ""This thing is a bright red apple"". But in severe depression, the hypotheses are weaker: ""This thing is probably an apple, and it's probably reddish"".</p>
<h1>Psychomotor retardation</h1>
<p>Again, this one is just like Scott says. In predictive coding theory, top-down predictions about proprioceptive inputs are exactly the same signals as (semi)low-level motor control commands. (I say ""semi-low-level"" because most motor commands go through an additional layer of brainstem and spinal cord control.)</p>
<p>If a hypothesis makes predictions about proprioceptive inputs with strength zero, then the muscles don't move at all, like the TV static + foot example above. If it makes predictions with the normal high strength, then the muscles move normally. Thus, somewhere in between, there's a threshold where a hypothesis is making a very feeble prediction of proprioceptive inputs, that can just barely and unreliably activate the downstream motor programs.</p>
<p>(<strong>UPDATE June 2021:</strong> Shortly after writing this post, I stopped believing that proprioceptive predictions are exactly the same as motor commands. Instead I should have said ""motor commands are the same type of neocortical signal as top-down predictions"". See <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/isDCEmYHsosyAjLRK/predictive-coding-and-motor-control"">here</a> for where I changed my mind on that. But the point still stands: weaker top-down predictions mess up motor commands.)</p>
<h1>Lack of motivation</h1>
<p>Hypotheses make predictions about both sensory inputs (vision etc.) and internal inputs (satiety, pain, etc.); I don't think there's any mechanistic difference between those two types of predictions. (By the same token, even though I drew (b) and (c) as separate rows in the picture above, they're actually implemented by the same basic mechanism.)</p>
<p>In depression, the hypotheses' predictions about internal inputs have anomalously low strength, just like all their other predictions. Thus instead of a normal hypothesis like ""I will eat and then I will feel full"", when depressed you get stuck with the weak hypothesis ""I will eat and then I <em>might</em> feel full.""</p>
<p>Now look at process (e). I claim that process (e) does not change at all in depression: we still have the normal innate drives, and we still favor hypotheses which predict that those drives will be satisfied. But (e) votes much less strongly for the weak hypothesis (""I will eat and then I <em>might</em> feel full"") than for the normal hypothesis (""I will eat and then I <em>will</em> feel full""). Now, I think that we universally have a bias towards inaction—don't take an action unless there's a good reason to. So in depression, the bias towards inaction often wins out over the feeble vote from process (e), and thus we don't bother to get up and eat.</p>
<p>(<strong>UPDATE June 2021</strong>: Having learned much more since writing this—see <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/jrewt3rLFiKWrKuyZ/big-picture-of-phasic-dopamine"">here</a>—I guess this isn't <em>exactly</em> wrong, but I would say it differently: I think there's a dynamic where part of the brain (including dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and hippocampus) proposes a plan, and then another part of the brain (including medial prefrontal cortex and amygdala) evaluates the physiological implications of that plan. If the plan-proposer is proposing plans in an inaudible whisper, then the plan-evaluator can't hear it, so to speak. See bottom section of <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/jqTeghCJ2anMHPPjG/book-review-feeling-great-by-david-burns"">Book review: Feeling Great</a>)</p>
<h1>Low self-confidence</h1>
<p>All the predictive coding machinery operates basically the same way during (i) actual experience, (ii) memory recall, and (iii) imagination. Now, when we try to figure out, ""Will I succeed at X?"", we imagine/plan doing X, which entails searching through the space of hypotheses for one in which X successfully occurs at the end. In depression, none of the hypotheses will make a strong prediction that X will occur, because of course they don't make strong predictions of anything at all. We interpret that as ""I cannot see any way that I will succeed; thus I will fail"".</p>
<p>Why isn't it symmetric? None of the theories are making strong predictions of failure either, right? Well, I think that generically when people are planning out how to do something, they search through their hypothesis space for a hypothesis that has a specific indicator of success; they don't search for a hypothesis that <em>lacks</em> a specific indicator of failure. I just don't think you can run the neural hypothesis search algorithm in that opposite way.<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-dcszerdJCZ8uqSb2Y-1"" id=""fnref-dcszerdJCZ8uqSb2Y-1"">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>There's another consideration that points in the same direction. Everyone always lets their current mood leak into their memories and expectations: when you're happy, it's tricky to remember being sad, etc. I think this is just because episodic memories and other hypotheses leave lots of gaps that we fill in with our current selves. Anyway, I hypothesize that this effect is <em>even stronger</em> when depressed: if you feel sad and anxious right now, <em>and</em> if none of your hypotheses contain a strong prediction of feeling happiness or any other emotion, well then there's no emotion to be found except sadness and anxiety in your remembered past, or in your present, or in your imagined future. So, ask such a person whether they'll succeed, and they might answer the question by just trying to imagine themselves feeling the joy of victory. They can't. Ask whether they'll fail, and they'll try to imagine themselves feeling miserable. Well, they can do that! They are feeling miserable feelings right now, and those feelings can flood into an imagined future scenario. (See <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic"">Availability heuristic</a>.)</p>
<p>So, putting these two considerations together, a depressed person should have a very hard time imagining a specific course of events in which they accomplish anything in particular, and should have an equally hard time imagining themselves having proudly accomplished it. But they can <em>easily</em> imagine themselves not getting anything done, and continuing to feel the same misery that they feel right now. I think that's a recipe for low self-confidence.</p>
<h1>Feelings of sadness, worthlessness, self-hatred, etc.</h1>
<p>(<strong>UPDATE June 2021</strong>: Please ignore this entire section, I was young and confused at the time. See bottom section of <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/jqTeghCJ2anMHPPjG/book-review-feeling-great-by-david-burns"">Book review: Feeling Great</a> for a summary of what I think now instead.)</p>
<p>Everything about predictive coding happens in the cortex.<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-dcszerdJCZ8uqSb2Y-2"" id=""fnref-dcszerdJCZ8uqSb2Y-2"">[2]</a></sup> But when we talk about mood, we need to bring in the amygdala.<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-dcszerdJCZ8uqSb2Y-3"" id=""fnref-dcszerdJCZ8uqSb2Y-3"">[3]</a></sup> My hypothesis is that the amygdala is functioning normally (i.e., according to specification) in depression. The problem lies in the signals it receives from the cortex.</p>
<p>Let's step back for a minute and talk about the interesting relationship between the cortex and amygdala. I discussed it a bit in <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NkSpukDkm9pjRdMdB/human-instincts-symbol-grounding-and-the-blank-slate"">Human instincts, symbol grounding, and the blank-slate neocortex</a>. The amygdala is nominally responsible for emotions, yet figuring out what emotions to feel requires excruciatingly complex calculations that only the cortex is capable of. (""No, YOU were supposed to do the dishes, because remember I went shopping three times but you only vacuumed once and..."").</p>
<p>I think the cortex-amygdala relationship for emotions is somewhat analogous to the cortex-muscle relationship for motor control: The cortex sends signals to the amygdala, which are ""predictions"" from the cortex's perspective and ""input information"" from the amygdala's perspective. The amygdala uses that information, along with other sources of information (pain, satiety, etc.), to decide what emotions to emit. (See <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/3wmJRBjMHA4c9D4Cd/predictive-coding-and-depression#KC3PktK5D2yWH7hvE"">this comment</a> for more.)</p>
<p>Back to depression. Again, outgoing signals from the cortex are synonymous with top-down predictions. So when all the top-down predictions get weaker, simultaneously the signals from the cortex to the amygdala get globally weaker.</p>
<p>Then what?</p>
<p>In principle, you could imagine two worlds. In one extreme world, the messages from the cortex to the amygdala only contain bad news—I've been insulted, that's disgusting, I'm in trouble, etc. Then, when the cortical signals get globally weaker, the amygdala would flood us with joy. Everything is perfect!</p>
<p>In the opposite extreme world, the messages from the cortex to the amygdala only contain good news—I'm not being insulted right now, I am not disgusted right now, I have lots of friends, etc. Then, when the cortical signals get globally weaker, the amygdala would flood us with misery. Everything must be terrible!</p>
<p>In the real world, the cortex presumably sends both good-news messages and bad-news messages to the amygdala. But unfortunately for those suffering depression, it seems that all things considered, ""no news is bad news"". Presumably the amygdala is especially expecting the cortex to send various good-news signals that say that our innate drives are being satisfied, that we have high status, that we're expecting more good things to happen in the future, etc. When these signals get weaker, the amygdala responds by emitting all sorts of negative emotions.</p>
<p>Evolutionarily speaking, what is sadness for? In my view, sadness has an effect of causing us to abandon our plans when they're not working out, and it also has a social effect of signaling to others that we are in a bad, unsustainable situation and need help. Well, the feeling that our innate drives are not being satisfied, and will not be satisfied in the foreseeable future ... that sure seems like it ought to precipitate sadness if anything does, right?</p>
<h1>Difficulty thinking and concentrating</h1>
<p>Prediction strength and attention are closely related. If you want to attend to the taste of the thing your eating, your brain modifies the active hypothesis to have super high strength on the predictions of sensory inputs from your taste buds. Then any slight deviation of the actual sensory input from expectations will trigger a prediction error and bubble up to top-level attention.</p>
<p>When you <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/HbXXd2givHBBLxr3d/against-system-1-and-system-2-subagent-sequence"">string together a bunch of little hypotheses into an extended train of thought</a>, attention has to be deftly steered around, to get the right information into the right places in working memory, and manipulate them the right way. It follows that if your brain can't deploy hypotheses with sufficiently strong predictions, you will probably be unable to fully control your attention and think complex thoughts.</p>
<h1>Insomnia</h1>
<p>Beats me. I don't understand sleep!</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>I'm pretty pleased that everything seems to fit together, without <em>too</em> much special pleading! But again, this is wild speculation, I especially don't know anything about depression. I'm happy to hear feedback.</p>
<h1>Addendum: Speculating on what causes depression</h1>
<p>(<strong>UPDATE June 2021</strong>: Please ignore this entire section, I was young and confused at the time. See bottom section of <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/jqTeghCJ2anMHPPjG/book-review-feeling-great-by-david-burns"">Book review: Feeling Great</a> for a summary of what I think now instead.)</p>
<p>I think there has to be a vicious cycle involved in depression, otherwise it wouldn't persist. Here's my guess:</p>
<p><em>Vicious cycle: Globally weaker predictions cause sadness, and sadness causes globally weaker predictions.</em></p>
<p>I already talked about the first part. But why (evolutionarily) might sadness cause globally weaker predictions? Well, one evolutionary goal of sadness is to prompt us to abandon our current plans and strategies, even ones we're deeply tied to, in the event that our prospects are grim and we can't see any way to make things better. Globally weaker predictions would do that! As you weaken the prediction, ""active plans"" turn into ""possible plans"", then into ""vague musings""...</p>
<p>Anyway, maybe that vicious cycle dynamic is always present to some extent, but other processes push in other directions and keep our emotions stable. ...Until a biochemical insult—or an unusually prolonged bout of ""normal"" sadness (e.g. from grief)—tips the system out of balance, and we get sucked into that vortex of mutually reinforcing ""sadness + globally weak predictions"".</p>

At the same time, it&apos;s something almost everyone can fruitfully work on (I suspect), including myself.</p><p>Somewhat similar to <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/riyvpus8x9sXa3W57/track-back-meditation"">track-back meditation</a>.</p><h1>Memory</h1><h2>Tip of the Tongue</h2><p>The central claim here is that there&apos;s a special art associated with what you do when something is &quot;on the tip of your tongue&quot; and you can&apos;t quite remember it. Most people have the skill to some extent, but, it can be sharpened to a fine point.</p><p>Improved memory helps you become truth-oriented in a fact-oriented, detail-oriented sense. It works against inaccuracy. It also works against misspeaking, and thus propagating falsehoods. </p><h2>Remembering Dreams</h2><p>I first explicitly noticed the effectiveness of this technique for remembering dreams. When I wake up, I often have only one significant memory from my dreams. However, when I focus on the memory, <em>explicitly</em> naming each detail I can recall, and <em>gently</em> waiting for more, I can often unfold the memory into far, far more than I initially thought I could remember.</p><ul><li>Each detail you recall can open up more details.</li><li>There&apos;s something special about explicitly naming details. I might have a general sense that there was a portal in the sky that looked a certain way, but explicitly confirming in my head that it looked as if the sky were broken glass, but at the same time the portal was perfectly round, might bring back more memories.</li><ul><li>Writing things down on paper is probably a good way of making sure you&apos;re explicitly confirming each detail, if you want to go that far.</li></ul><li>It&apos;s also very important to sit with memories and give them time to bring something more. Sometimes there will be a rush of memories, with each new item bringing more and more. Other times, you&apos;ll be stuck. It&apos;s easy to fail at that step, assuming that no more is coming. In my experience, if you sit with the memories, avoid getting distracted, and gently ask for more, more will often come to you fairly soon. You&apos;ll surprise yourself with what you can remember.</li></ul><p>Sometimes I don&apos;t even remember any images from the dream at all, but have a vague sense of the dream (excitement, peace, more complicated emotions). I can still sometimes recall much more if I explicitly describe the left-over feeling to myself in as much detail as possible, and sit with it patiently waiting for more.</p><p>Think of it as forming a better relationship with your memory. It&apos;s easier to wait patiently when you&apos;ve had several experiences where it&apos;s paid off. Explicitly processing details of what you&apos;ve remembered lets your memory know you&apos;re interested, helping to keep it engaged in searching for more (and, potentially, training it to retain more).</p><p>Eventually, if you&apos;re better calibrated, you won&apos;t have to wait 5 minutes trying fruitlessly if you really don&apos;t think you will remember. But in order to be well-calibrated about that, you have to try it sometimes.</p><p>You might be worried about confabulation. I&apos;ll talk more about that later.</p><h2>Remembering Events</h2><p>My claim is that this technique generalizes to any memory. Dreams might be a good practice case, especially if you don&apos;t have too many cognitively demanding distractions in the morning.</p><p>But you can try the same thing with anything. Someone I knew with especially good memory told me that he thought this was most of his skill; he might have started out with slightly above-average memory, at some point he started taking pride in his reputation for good memory. This prompted him to put effort into it, rehearsing memories much more than he otherwise would. People would then remark on his good memory, further reinforcing the behavior.</p><p>Conversations, and interactions with people generally, might make a good practice case. Many people already re-visit conversations mentally over and over (perhaps thinking of things they wish they&apos;d said). You can treat these the same way as dreams, trying to recall as much detail as you can each time you think of them.</p><p>Of course, rehearsing certain memories again and again might not be a good thing. Watch whether you&apos;re worsening any mental problems such as depression. It may be good to couple this practice with <a href=""http://mindingourway.com/staring-into-regrets/"">staring into regrets</a> and other emotionally balancing techniques, so that rehearsing memories is useful rather than intensifying emotional damage from those memories.</p><h2>False Memories</h2><p>Some studies about memory may give you pause.</p><ul><li>First of all, there is evidence that people fabricate false memories. So, how can we trust recall? Maybe trying harder to recall something actually generates false memories.</li><li>Second, there&apos;s been <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_consolidation#Reconsolidation"">some research suggesting</a> that in some sense we &quot;retrieve&quot; memories (take them out of storage), and then &quot;put them back&quot;; and if the process is disrupted before we &quot;put them back&quot;, we can be made to forget the memory. This suggests that memories might be altered every time they get touched, which would mean they&apos;d last longer if we didn&apos;t think about them.</li></ul><p>Unfortunately, forgetting is also a thing, so making memories last longer by avoiding them doesn&apos;t seem to be an option. Rehearsal is necessary for sharper memory.</p><p>Still, false memories seem like a significant concern. Memories just <em>seem real</em>. If false memories are really common and easy to create, what are we supposed to do about that?</p><p>I think the situation isn&apos;t really hopeless. I think most false memories are more like mistaken inferences. I might be sure I put my keys in my pants pocket, where I always put them. But then I might eventually recall that I put them somewhere else yesterday. What seemed like a memory was actually an inference.</p><p>As long as you&apos;re aware of these issues, I would expect that gently tugging on memories to recall more details would improve things rather than lead to more confabulation. </p><p>In my opinion, the critical turning point should be: if you are good enough at working with your memories that you have started to see through some of your own false memories, then you can start to become more confident in your judgements of which memories are real or false.</p><p>I could be wrong, of course. This is a critical question in how good/important the overall practice is.</p><h2>Gendlin&apos;s Focusing</h2><p>There&apos;s an obvious similarity between what I&apos;m describing and <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/PXqQhYEdbdAYCp88m/focusing-for-skeptics"">Gendlin&apos;s Focusing</a>. I similarly gently interact with a &quot;felt sense&quot; and try to name it, and iterate the process to get more detail. However, the &quot;felt sense&quot; is not especially located in my body the way it&apos;s described in Gendlin&apos;s focusing. It&apos;s possible that body sensations are actually involved at a subconscious level.</p><p>In any case, you may find the &quot;gentle tugging&quot; kind of stance useful for untangling emotions, not just recalling memories. Also, learning Focusing might help with memory and the other things I&apos;m describing in this post?</p><p>The connection to Focusing also supports the idea that you can tell between true memories and confabulations by checking the degree of &quot;fit&quot; -- you have a felt sense, then you describe the thing explicitly (which gives you a better &quot;handle&quot; for it), then you ask yourself whether the name &quot;resonates&quot; with the felt sense. This is like a reality check (a theme I&apos;ll return to in the inner-sim section). But of course this isn&apos;t particularly reassuring unless you already believe that Focusing is uncovering (as opposed to confabulating) information.</p><h2>Remembering Ideas</h2><p>I tend to place a high value on remembering ideas. A forgotten idea is like a little death. I generally prefer the conversation norm of pausing if someone has forgotten an idea, possibly for a significant amount of time, so they can try and recover it. Ideas are important.</p><p>This habit gave me a lot of practice with tip-of-the-tongue type recollection and the &quot;gentle tugging&quot; technique. Practicing this stuff seems quite important for being able to do it when you need it. So I think giving yourself significant time to try and remember forgotten ideas is quite valuable if only as practice.</p><p>I think a similar sort of mental motion is involved in <em>developing</em> ideas, as well. Let&apos;s move on from the memory section...</p><h1>Truth-Oriented Thinking</h1><h2>Developing Ideas</h2><p>When you have an idea, you start with a kind of &quot;pointer&quot; -- a felt sense which says that there should be a think in a particular direction. You can unpack the pointer by explicitly naming things about it, checking for &quot;fit&quot; with the felt sense. The more you name, the easier it is to pull more details out. </p><p>Sometimes it turns out that the idea really doesn&apos;t make any sense at all; the things with the best &quot;fit&quot; don&apos;t actually do anything good when you explicitly spell them out. Then the felt sense changes.</p><p>To me, it feels like the felt sense traces out natural &quot;pathways&quot; across a &quot;landscape&quot; which you&apos;re exploring. An idea might be a pointer which leads to a dead end, but there&apos;s still &quot;really a path there&quot; -- you had it, which must mean that it was a natural thought to have in <em>some </em>sense. I take interest not just in what&apos;s true, but what the natural development of certain ideas is. This kind of attitude helps you explore alternative pathways.</p><p>Gendlin describes his notion of Focusing as involved in scientific research. It&apos;s not just about emotions. I think I&apos;m describing the same thing here.</p><h2>Inner Sim</h2><p>CFAR teaches a class on &quot;inner sim&quot;, the intuitive expectations you have. When you try to balance one object on top of another, you have an intuition about whether it will fall. If someone tells you something, you might have an intuition about whether they&apos;re lying. You can&apos;t necessarily unpack these intuitions very well. Nor are they perfectly accurate. But they are quite useful.</p><p>The surprising thing is that it seems many people don&apos;t naturally make use of their inner sims as much as they could. Let&apos;s say you&apos;re at work, and you come up with a plan for completing a project within a week. The words &quot;planning fallacy&quot; might come to mind, but let&apos;s set that aside and ask a different question -- does your inner sim really expect the project to be done in a week? This kind of question can give useful information surprisingly often. And if your inner sim doesn&apos;t think the plan will work, you can try and ask yourself questions like why it will fail.</p><p>So, once you&apos;ve developed an idea via the methodology in the previous section, another thing you can do is ask your inner sim about the idea. Is it true? Is it real? Can it work? What do you <em>actually</em> expect?</p><p>Using gentle tugging for idea development is just as good for creating fact or fiction, so you have to add this kind of reality check.</p><p>Also, communicating with the inner sim can be a lot like communicating with memory. You can gently sit with the question &quot;what do I actually expect?&quot; and see what comes up. And you similarly want to try and explicitly name what comes up; each detail of your expectations which you explicitly name can help pull more out.</p><h2>Motivated Cognition</h2><p>Just like we worried about false memories, we might worry about motivated cognition. Does asking your inner sim <em>really</em> provide a truth check? Does following your felt sense create a bias in what ideas you develop?</p><p>In my experience, if I&apos;m caught up in motivated cognition, it is <em>literally harder to remember things which go against what I&apos;m saying</em> -- it seems like I just don&apos;t remember them. But the same memory techniques which I&apos;ve mentioned do help. I might not want to <em>say</em> the contrary facts once I recall them, but I can at least consciously decide that.</p><p>Similarly, I think the inner-sim checks are indeed useful in combating motivated cognition. Is it true? Is it real? What do I actually expect? What do I actually think? Giving yourself a little pause to sit with these questions can make you change your mind during an argument in a number of seconds (in my experience).</p><h2>Correcting Yourself</h2><p>For any of this to work during a conversation, I think you have to up your willingness to correct yourself. The thing is, if you notice <em>during</em> a conversation that you gave a false account of events, then there&apos;s going to be some consistency bias making you favor the version you&apos;ve already said, and maybe some cognitive dissonance around not thinking of yourself as someone who gives false accounts.</p><p>It&apos;s not too uncommon for me to describe something with a nice &quot;narrative logic&quot; to it, and then remember some facts which don&apos;t fit the narrative. These additional facts may not even improve the other person&apos;s understanding of the situation -- the narrative is optimized to explain things in an understandable way, whereas the corrected detail isn&apos;t. But nowadays I try to mention them &quot;for my own sanity&quot; even if it doesn&apos;t make the conversation better.</p><p>If I don&apos;t do this, memory checks and reality checks will often feel counterproductive in conversations. If I&apos;m unwilling to abandon my narrative <em>verbally</em>, then correcting it <em>internally</em> is a wasted motion which just generates a narrative/fact divide which I then have to track.</p><h2>Explaining Things to Others</h2><p>Just as explicitly naming things within your own head can help you pull detail out, once you <em>think</em> you understand something, explaining it to someone else can help pull a whole lot more detail out. This is probably true for memory, too.</p><p>It&apos;s not even necessarily about the interaction with the other person. Just trying to write something for someone else (and then never sharing it) can be similarly useful, whether it&apos;s a specific audience or a broad one. The need to bridge the inferential gap makes many more details feel <em>relevant</em>, which didn&apos;t feel relevant when you were explaining it to yourself.</p><p>Naturally, communicating an idea to another person is also great for uncovering problems.</p><p>This goes back to the reason why the overall technique I&apos;m discussing works at all. Explicitly naming details of a memory helps to unpack it because what you know you know is different than what you know. You have a kind of mental illusion that you&apos;re remembering a whole conversation, but you&apos;re not really fitting all those details in short-term memory, which means you&apos;re not successfully pulling on all the associations. Similarly, you might <em>think</em> you understand something, but be unable to really explain all the details.</p><h2>Gears Thinking</h2><p><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/B7P97C27rvHPz3s9B/gears-in-understanding"">Gears-level thinking</a> is like unpacking an idea with exceptionally high standards about whether you really understand it. I mentioned that explaining things to others is helpful because you &quot;pull on&quot; details which you wouldn&apos;t ordinarily pull on, since you think you understand them. Gears thinking doesn&apos;t literally pull on &quot;everything&quot;, but it pulls on a lot more.</p><p>I&apos;m afraid that someone will read that and kind of nod along without getting it. I&apos;m not talking about just generally having higher standards. I&apos;m talking about the moment-to-moment experience of thinking. I&apos;m saying there&apos;s a mental stance you can take where you &quot;stop being lazy about your thinking&quot; -- you don&apos;t re-check really solid things like 1+1=2, but you aren&apos;t satisfied with a thought until you&apos;ve really gotten <em>all</em> the details in a significant sense.</p><p>The question you ask isn&apos;t <em>whether</em> something is true; the question you ask is <em>exactly why</em> it&apos;s true. No matter how confident you are that, say, a theorem you&apos;re using holds, <em>you want the proof</em>. You&apos;re trying to see all the pieces and how they fit together.</p><p>It&apos;s like pulling out a moth-eaten map and looking at the holes, trying to fill them in. Maybe you can&apos;t fill them in right away; maybe you have to make a voyage across the sea. It&apos;s hard. But you want those details; you want the map to be <em>complete</em>, not just &quot;good enough&quot;.</p><h2>Understanding Others</h2><p>There&apos;s a closely related mental stance which I call &quot;ask all the questions&quot;. You might think, from the kind of Focusing-like habits I&apos;ve been describing, that you have to turn within to get the answers. But your focusing object can also be outside of you. </p><p>You can orient this toward typical social small-talk. What cognitive habits lead someone to ask questions like &quot;what school did you go to&quot; or &quot;do you have any siblings&quot;? You could have a mental list of standard questions you ask people in social settings. But a different way, which I think is more efficient, is to focus on your &quot;picture&quot; of the person (sort of mentally rehearsing it) and asking questions to fill in the gaps.</p><p>Something which surprised me when I tried this attitude on was how self-centred it felt. You&apos;re still looking at <em>your</em> map for holes. And, you&apos;re kind of dominating the conversation, in terms of steering. But, you can bring in the gentle/patient attitude I keep talking about.</p><p>You can do the same for topics other than small talk. Maybe you are trying to understand how someone things about X. What many people do is focus mainly on their own picture of X, and let what the other person says kind of land in that map, focusing questions on problems. And that&apos;s useful. But you can also focus on <em>your map of their map</em>. (This might start out being a copy of your map, since you might assume that they mostly think about X like you and just have some different details. But the cognitive operation is already different; you bring your attention to the places least likely to be the same as for you.)</p><p>Again I want to emphasize that I&apos;m talking about a moment-to-moment stance. Not occasionally thinking &quot;what&apos;s my map of their map?&quot; during a conversation. Focusing on it <em>primarily</em>, letting it drive most of your questions.</p><p>This can be a good way of absorbing technical subjects from people.</p>",abramdemski,abramdemski,abramdemski,

To that end I&apos;d like to briefly share part of my model of the world that seems to be outside the rationalist cannon in an explicit way, but which I think is known well to most, and talk a bit about how I think it is relevant to you, dear reader. Its name is &quot;normalization of deviance&quot;.</p><p>If you&apos;ve worked a job, attended school, driven a car, or even just grew up with a guardian, you&apos;ve most likely experienced normalization of deviance. It happens when your boss tells you to do one thing but all your coworkers do something else and your boss expects you to do the same as them. It happens when the teacher gives you a deadline but lets everyone turn in the assignment late. It happens when you have to speed to keep up with traffic to avoid causing an accident. And it happens when parents lay down rules but routinely allow exceptions such that the rules might as well not even exist.</p><p>It took a much less mundane situation for the idea to crystalize and get a name. <a href=""https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Professionalism/Diane_Vaughan_and_the_normalization_of_deviance"">Diane Vaughan coined the term as part of her research into the causes of the Challenger explosion</a>, where she described normalization of deviance as what happens when people within an organization become so used to deviant behavior that they don&apos;t see the deviance, even if that deviance is actively working against an important goal (in the case of Challenger, safety). From her work the idea has spread to considerations in <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25742063"">healthcare</a>, <a href=""https://fastjetperformance.com/podcasts/how-i-almost-destroyed-a-50-million-war-plane-when-display-flying-goes-wrong-and-the-normalisation-of-deviance/"">aeronautics</a>, <a href=""https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2016/01/it_security_and.html"">security</a>, and, where I learned about it, <a href=""http://danluu.com/wat/"">software engineering</a>. Along the way the idea has generalized from being specifically about organizations, violations of standard operating procedures, and safety to any situation where norms are so regularly violated that they are replaced by the de facto norms of the violations.</p><p>I think normalization of deviance shows up all over the place and is likely quietly happening in your life right now <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/mELQFMi9egPn5EAjK/my-attempt-to-explain-looking-insight-meditation-and"">just outside where you are bothering to look</a>. Here&apos;s some ways I think this might be relevant to you, and I encourage you to mention more in the comments:</p><ul><li>If you are trying to establish a new habit, regular violations of the intended habit may result in a deviant, skewed version of the habit being adopted.</li><li>If you are trying to live up to an ideal (truth telling, <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/uDkSiQKKPA5vjjQiv/if-i-must-eat-meat-i-eat-pork"">vegetarianism</a>, <a href=""https://www.effectivealtruism.org/"">charitable giving</a>, etc.), regularly tolerating violations of that ideal draws you away from it in a sneaky, subtle way that you may still claim to be upholding the ideal when in fact you are not and not even really trying to.</li><li>If you are trying to establish norms in a community, <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ZHsFC8kjGvbYKaJiD/speaking-up-publicly-is-heroic"">regularly allowing norm violations</a> will result in different norms than those you intended being adopted.</li></ul><p>Those mentioned, my purpose in this post is to be informative, but I know that some of you will read this and make the short leap to treating it as advice that you should aim to allow less normalization of deviance, perhaps by being more <a href=""https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2015/03/03/scrupulosity/"">scrupulous</a> or less forgiving. Maybe, but before you jump to that, I encourage you to remember the adage about <a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/03/24/should-you-reverse-any-advice-you-hear/"">reversing all advice</a>. Sometimes normalized &quot;deviance&quot; isn&apos;t so much deviance as an illegible norm that is <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Zm7WAJMTaFvuh2Wc7/book-review-the-secret-of-our-success"">serving an important purpose</a> and <a href=""https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2010/07/26/a-big-little-idea-called-legibility/"">&quot;fixing&quot; it will actually break things</a> or <a href=""https://meaningness.com/systematic-mode"">otherwise make things worse</a>. And not all deviance is <em>normalized</em> deviance: if you don&apos;t leave yourself enough <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yLLkWMDbC9ZNKbjDG/slack"">slack</a> you&apos;ll likely fail from trying too hard. So I encourage you to know about normalization of deviance, to notice it, and be deliberate about how you choose to respond to it.</p>",gworley,gordon-seidoh-worley,Gordon Seidoh Worley,

In this edition, I summarize four conversations that AI Impacts had with researchers who were optimistic that AI safety would be solved &quot;by default&quot;. (Note that one of the conversations was with me.)</p><p>While all four of these conversations covered very different topics, I think there were three main points of convergence. First, we were relatively <strong>unconvinced by the traditional arguments for AI risk</strong>, and <strong>find discontinuities relatively unlikely</strong>. Second, we were more optimistic about <strong>solving the problem in the future</strong>, when we know more about the problem and have more evidence about powerful AI systems. And finally, we were more optimistic that as we get more evidence of the problem in the future, <strong>the existing ML community will actually try to fix that problem</strong>.</p><p><u><a href=""https://aiimpacts.org/conversation-with-paul-christiano/"">Conversation with Paul Christiano</a></u> <em>(Paul Christiano, Asya Bergal, Ronny Fernandez, and Robert Long)</em> (summarized by Rohin): There can&apos;t be too many things that reduce the expected value of the future by 10%; if there were, there would be no expected value left (ETA: see <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/QknPz9JQTQpGdaWDp/an-80-why-ai-risk-might-be-solved-without-additional#WWufqvbyESxNDEtDJ"">this comment</a>). So, the prior that any particular thing has such an impact should be quite low. With AI in particular, obviously we&apos;re going to try to make AI systems that do what we want them to do. So starting from this position of optimism, we can then evaluate the arguments for doom. The two main arguments: first, we can&apos;t distinguish ahead of time between AIs that are trying to do the right thing, and AIs that are trying to kill us, because the latter will behave nicely until they can execute a treacherous turn. Second, since we don&apos;t have a crisp concept of &quot;doing the right thing&quot;, we can&apos;t select AI systems on whether they are doing the right thing.</p><p>However, there are many &quot;saving throws&quot;, or ways that the argument could break down, avoiding doom. Perhaps there&apos;s no problem at all, or perhaps we can cope with it with a little bit of effort, or perhaps we can coordinate to not build AIs that destroy value. Paul assigns a decent amount of probability to each of these (and other) saving throws, and any one of them suffices to avoid doom. This leads Paul to estimate that AI risk reduces the expected value of the future by roughly 10%, a relatively optimistic number. Since it is so neglected, concerted effort by longtermists could reduce it to 5%, making it still a very valuable area for impact. The main way he expects to change his mind is from evidence from more powerful AI systems, e.g. as we build more powerful AI systems, perhaps inner optimizer concerns will materialize and we&apos;ll see examples where an AI system executes a non-catastrophic treacherous turn.</p><p>Paul also believes that clean algorithmic problems are usually solvable in 10 years, or provably impossible, and early failures to solve a problem don&apos;t provide much evidence of the difficulty of the problem (unless they generate proofs of impossibility). So, the fact that we don&apos;t know how to solve alignment now doesn&apos;t provide very strong evidence that the problem is impossible. Even if the clean versions of the problem were impossible, that would suggest that the problem is much more messy, which requires more concerted effort to solve but also tends to be just a long list of relatively easy tasks to do. (In contrast, MIRI thinks that prosaic AGI alignment is probably impossible.)</p><p>Note that even finding out that the problem is impossible can help; it makes it more likely that we can all coordinate to not build dangerous AI systems, since no one <em>wants</em> to build an unaligned AI system. Paul thinks that right now the case for AI risk is not very compelling, and so people don&apos;t care much about it, but if we could generate more compelling arguments, then they would take it more seriously. If instead you think that the case is already compelling (as MIRI does), then you would be correspondingly more pessimistic about others taking the arguments seriously and coordinating to avoid building unaligned AI.</p><p>One potential reason MIRI is more doomy is that they take a somewhat broader view of AI safety: in particular, in addition to building an AI that is trying to do what you want it to do, they would also like to ensure that when the AI builds successors, it does so well. In contrast, Paul simply wants to leave the next generation of AI systems in at least as good a situation as we find ourselves in now, since they will be both better informed and more intelligent than we are. MIRI has also previously defined aligned AI as one that produces good outcomes when run, which is a much broader conception of the problem than Paul has. But probably the main disagreement between MIRI and ML researchers and that ML researchers expect that we&apos;ll try a bunch of stuff, and something will work out, whereas MIRI expects that the problem is really hard, such that trial and error will only get you solutions that <em>appear</em> to work.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> A general theme here seems to be that MIRI feels like they have very strong arguments, while Paul thinks that they&apos;re plausible arguments, but aren&apos;t extremely strong evidence. Simply having a lot more uncertainty leads Paul to be much more optimistic. I agree with most of this.</p><p>However, I do disagree with the point about &quot;clean&quot; problems. I agree that clean algorithmic problems are usually solved within 10 years or are provably impossible, but it doesn&apos;t seem to me like AI risk counts as a clean algorithmic problem: we don&apos;t have a nice formal statement of the problem that doesn&apos;t rely on intuitive concepts like &quot;optimization&quot;, &quot;trying to do something&quot;, etc. This suggests to me that AI risk is more &quot;messy&quot;, and so may require more time to solve.</p><p><u><a href=""https://aiimpacts.org/conversation-with-rohin-shah/"">Conversation with Rohin Shah</a></u> <em>(Rohin Shah, Asya Bergal, Robert Long, and Sara Haxhia)</em> (summarized by Rohin): The main reason I am optimistic about AI safety is that we will see problems in advance, and we will solve them, because nobody wants to build unaligned AI. A likely crux is that I think that the ML community will actually solve the problems, as opposed to applying a bandaid fix that doesn&apos;t scale. I don&apos;t know why there are different underlying intuitions here.</p><p>In addition, many of the classic arguments for AI safety involve a system that can be decomposed into an objective function and a world model, which I suspect will not be a good way to model future AI systems. In particular, current systems trained by RL look like a grab bag of heuristics that correlate well with obtaining high reward. I think that as AI systems become more powerful, the heuristics will become more and more general, but they still won&apos;t decompose naturally into an objective function, a world model, and search. In addition, we can look at humans as an example: we don&apos;t fully pursue convergent instrumental subgoals; for example, humans can be convinced to pursue different goals. This makes me more skeptical of traditional arguments.</p><p>I would guess that AI systems will become <em>more</em> interpretable in the future, as they start using the features / concepts / abstractions that humans are using. Eventually, sufficiently intelligent AI systems will probably find even better concepts that are alien to us, but if we only consider AI systems that are (say) 10x more intelligent than us, they will probably still be using human-understandable concepts. This should make alignment and oversight of these systems significantly easier. For significantly stronger systems, we should be delegating the problem to the AI systems that are 10x more intelligent than us. (This is very similar to the picture painted in <u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/X2i9dQQK3gETCyqh2/chris-olah-s-views-on-agi-safety"">Chris Olah&#x2019;s views on AGI safety</a></u> (<u><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/cac125522aa3/an-72-alignment-robustness-methodology-and-system-building-as-research-priorities-for-ai-safety"">AN #72</a></u>), but that had not been published and I was not aware of Chris&apos;s views at the time of this conversation.)</p><p>I&apos;m also less worried about race dynamics increasing <em>accident</em> risk than the median researcher. The benefit of racing a little bit faster is to have a little bit more power / control over the future, while also increasing the risk of extinction a little bit. This seems like a bad trade from each agent&apos;s perspective. (That is, the Nash equilibrium is for all agents to be cautious, because the potential upside of racing is small and the potential downside is large.) I&apos;d be more worried if [AI risk is real AND not everyone agrees AI risk is real when we have powerful AI systems], or if the potential upside was larger (e.g. if racing a little more made it much more likely that you could achieve a decisive strategic advantage).</p><p>Overall, it feels like there&apos;s around 90% chance that AI would not cause x-risk without additional intervention by longtermists. The biggest disagreement between me and more pessimistic researchers is that I think gradual takeoff is much more likely than discontinuous takeoff (and in fact, the first, third and fourth paragraphs above are quite weak if there&apos;s a discontinuous takeoff). If I condition on discontinuous takeoff, then I mostly get very confused about what the world looks like, but I also get a lot more worried about AI risk, especially because the &quot;AI is to humans as humans are to ants&quot; analogy starts looking more accurate. In the interview I said 70% chance of doom in this world, but with <em>way</em> more uncertainty than any of the other credences, because I&apos;m really confused about what that world looks like. Two other disagreements, besides the ones above: I don&apos;t buy <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/suxvE2ddnYMPJN9HD/realism-about-rationality"">Realism about rationality</a></u> (<u><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/0c5eeec28f75/alignment-newsletter-25"">AN #25</a></u>), whereas I expect many pessimistic researchers do. I may also be more pessimistic about our ability to write proofs about fuzzy concepts like those that arise in alignment.</p><p>On timelines, I estimated a very rough 50% chance of AGI within 20 years, and 30-40% chance that it would be using &quot;essentially current techniques&quot; (which is obnoxiously hard to define). Conditional on both of those, I estimated 70% chance that it would be something like a mesa optimizer; mostly because optimization is a very useful instrumental strategy for solving many tasks, especially because gradient descent and other current algorithms are very weak optimization algorithms (relative to e.g. humans), and so learned optimization algorithms will be necessary to reach human levels of sample efficiency.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> Looking over this again, I&apos;m realizing that I didn&apos;t emphasize enough that most of my optimism comes from the more outside view type considerations: that we&apos;ll get warning signs that the ML community won&apos;t ignore, and that the AI risk arguments are not watertight. The other parts are particular inside view disagreements that make me more optimistic, but they don&apos;t factor in much into my optimism besides being examples of how the meta considerations could play out. I&apos;d recommend <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/mdau2DBSMi5bWXPGA/useful-does-not-mean-secure#xccsZeboCNcNJeGas"">this comment of mine</a></u> to get more of a sense of how the meta considerations factor into my thinking.</p><p>I was also glad to see that I still broadly agree with things I said ~5 months ago (since no major new opposing evidence has come up since then), though as I mentioned above, I would now change what I place emphasis on.</p><p><u><a href=""https://aiimpacts.org/conversation-with-robin-hanson/"">Conversation with Robin Hanson</a></u> <em>(Robin Hanson, Asya Bergal, and Robert Long)</em> (summarized by Rohin): The main theme of this conversation is that AI safety does not look particularly compelling on an outside view. Progress in most areas is relatively incremental and continuous; we should expect the same to be true for AI, suggesting that timelines should be quite long, on the order of centuries. The current AI boom looks similar to previous AI booms, which didn&apos;t amount to much in the past.</p><p>Timelines could be short if progress in AI were &quot;lumpy&quot;, as in a FOOM scenario. This could happen if intelligence was one simple thing that just has to be discovered, but Robin expects that intelligence is actually a bunch of not-very-general tools that together let us do many things, and we simply have to find all of these tools, which will presumably not be lumpy. Most of the value from tools comes from more specific, narrow tools, and intelligence should be similar. In addition, the literature on human uniqueness suggests that it wasn&apos;t &quot;raw intelligence&quot; or small changes to brain architecture that makes humans unique, it&apos;s our ability to process culture (communicating via language, learning from others, etc).</p><p>In any case, many researchers are now distancing themselves from the FOOM scenario, and are instead arguing that AI risk occurs due to standard principal-agency problems, in the situation where the agent (AI) is much smarter than the principal (human). Robin thinks that this doesn&apos;t agree with the existing literature on principal-agent problems, in which losses from principal-agent problems tend to be bounded, even when the agent is smarter than the principal.</p><p>You might think that since the stakes are so high, it&apos;s worth working on it anyway. Robin agrees that it&apos;s worth having a few people (say a hundred) pay attention to the problem, but doesn&apos;t think it&apos;s worth spending a lot of effort on it right now. Effort is much more effective and useful once the problem becomes clear, or once you are working with a concrete design; we have neither of these right now and so we should expect that most effort ends up being ineffective. It would be better if we saved our resources for the future, or if we spent time thinking about other ways that the future could go (as in his book, Age of Em).</p><p>It&apos;s especially bad that AI safety has thousands of &quot;fans&quot;, because this leads to a &quot;crying wolf&quot; effect -- even if the researchers have subtle, nuanced beliefs, they cannot control the message that the fans convey, which will not be nuanced and will instead confidently predict doom. Then when doom doesn&apos;t happen, people will learn not to believe arguments about AI risk.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> Interestingly, I agree with almost all of this, even though it&apos;s (kind of) arguing that I shouldn&apos;t be doing AI safety research at all. The main place I disagree is that losses from principal-agent problems with perfectly rational agents are bounded -- this seems crazy to me, and I&apos;d be interested in specific paper recommendations (though note <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ktDKfKqukTPRiuEPM/robin-hanson-on-the-futurist-focus-on-ai#fecYAwjmMSZ9KRfPL"">I</a></u> <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ktDKfKqukTPRiuEPM/robin-hanson-on-the-futurist-focus-on-ai#yRLaEzT57K4q5Qz5H"">and</a></u> <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ktDKfKqukTPRiuEPM/robin-hanson-on-the-futurist-focus-on-ai#p6CGEFbqaYJb49jME"">others</a></u> have searched and not found many).</p><p>On the point about lumpiness, my model is that there are only a few underlying factors (such as the ability to process culture) that allow humans to so quickly learn to do so many tasks, and almost all tasks require near-human levels of these factors to be done well. So, once AI capabilities on these factors reach approximately human level, we will &quot;suddenly&quot; start to see AIs beating humans on many tasks, resulting in a &quot;lumpy&quot; increase on the metric of &quot;number of tasks on which AI is superhuman&quot; (which seems to be the metric that people often use, though I don&apos;t like it, precisely because it seems like it wouldn&apos;t measure progress well until AI becomes near-human-level).</p><p><u><a href=""https://aiimpacts.org/conversation-with-adam-gleave/"">Conversation with Adam Gleave</a></u> <em>(Adam Gleave et al)</em> (summarized by Rohin): Adam finds the traditional arguments for AI risk unconvincing. First, it isn&apos;t clear that we will build an AI system that is so capable that it can fight all of humanity from its initial position where it doesn&apos;t have any resources, legal protections, etc. While discontinuous progress in AI could cause this, Adam doesn&apos;t see much reason to expect such discontinuous progress: it seems like AI is progressing by using more computation rather than finding fundamental insights. Second, we don&apos;t know how difficult AI safety will turn out to be; he gives a probability of ~10% that the problem is as hard as (a caricature of) MIRI suggests, where any design not based on mathematical principles will be unsafe. This is especially true because as we get closer to AGI we&apos;ll have many more powerful AI techniques that we can leverage for safety. Thirdly, Adam does expect that AI researchers will eventually solve safety problems; they don&apos;t right now because it seems premature to work on those problems. Adam would be more worried if there were more arms race dynamics, or more empirical evidence or solid theoretical arguments in support of speculative concerns like inner optimizers. He would be less worried if AI researchers spontaneously started to work on relative problems (more than they already do).</p><p>Adam makes the case for AI safety work differently. At the highest level, it seems possible to build AGI, and some organizations are trying very hard to build AGI, and if they succeed it would be transformative. That alone is enough to justify some effort into making sure such a technology is used well. Then, looking at the field itself, it seems like the field is not currently focused on doing good science and engineering to build safe, reliable systems. So there is an opportunity to have an impact by pushing on safety and reliability. Finally, there are several technical problems that we do need to solve before AGI, such as how we get information about what humans actually want.</p><p>Adam also thinks that it&apos;s 40-50% likely that when we build AGI, a PhD thesis describing it would be understandable by researchers today without too much work, but ~50% that it&apos;s something radically different. However, it&apos;s only 10-20% likely that AGI comes only from small variations of current techniques (i.e. by vastly increasing data and compute). He would see this as more likely if we hit additional milestones by investing more compute and data (OpenAI Five was an example of such a milestone).</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> I broadly agree with all of this, with two main differences. First, I am less worried about some of the technical problems that Adam mentions, such as how to get information about what humans want, or how to improve the robustness of AI systems, and more concerned about the more traditional problem of how to create an AI system that is <em>trying</em> to do what you want. Second, I am more bullish on the creation of AGI using small variations on current techniques, but vastly increasing compute and data (I&apos;d assign ~30%, while Adam assigns 10-20%).</p>",rohinmshah,rohinmshah,Rohin Shah,

yu628W2EtdgmH8dq3,Does GPT-2 Understand Anything?,does-gpt-2-understand-anything-1,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yu628W2EtdgmH8dq3/does-gpt-2-understand-anything-1,2020-01-02T17:09:14.641Z,37,28,23,False,False,,"<p>Some people have expressed that &#x201C;GPT-2 doesn&#x2019;t understand anything about language or reality. It&#x2019;s just huge statistics.&#x201D; In at least two senses, this is true. </p><p><br>First, GPT-2 has no sensory organs. So when it talks about how things look or sound or feel and gets it right, it is just because it read something similar on the web somewhere. The best understanding it could have is the kind of understanding one gets from reading, not from direct experiences. Nor does it have the kind of understanding that a person does when reading, where the words bring to mind memories of past direct experiences. </p><p><br>Second, GPT-2 has no qualia. This is related to the previous point, but distinct from it. One could imagine building a robotic body with cameras for eyes and microphones for ears that fed .png and .wav files to something like GPT-2 rather than .html files. Such a system would have what might be called experiences of the world. It would not, however, create an direct internal impression of redness or loudness, the ineffable conscious experience that accompanies sensation. </p><p><br>However, this is too high a bar to rule out understanding. Perhaps we should call the understanding that comes from direct personal experience &#x201C;real understanding&#x201D; and the kind that comes solely from reading with no connection to personal experience &#x201C;abstract understanding.&#x201D; Although I can&#x2019;t &#x201C;really understand&#x201D; what it was like to fight in the Vietnam War (because I wasn&#x2019;t there, man) I can still understand it in an abstract sense. With an abstract understanding, here are some things one can do:</p><p><br>&#x2022;	answer questions about it in one&#x2019;s own words <br>&#x2022;	define it <br>&#x2022;	use it appropriately in a sentence <br>&#x2022;	provide details about it <br>&#x2022;	summarize it </p><p><br>Professional teachers distinguish between tests of knowledge (which can be handled by mere memorization) and tests of understanding, with the latter being more difficult and useful (see <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom%27s_taxonomy"">Bloom&#x2019;s Taxonomy</a>). Understanding requires connecting a new idea to ideas a student is already familiar with.</p><p><br>GPT-2 is able to pass many such tests of understanding. With an appropriate prompt (such as giving examples of what form the answer to a question should take) it is able to answer questions, define terms, use words appropriately in a sentence, provide details, and summarize. </p><p><br>This is understanding for most practical purposes. It shows that when GPT-2 uses a word, that word has the appropriate kinds of connections to other words. The word has been integrated into a large graph-like structure of relationships between what can reasonably be called concepts or ideas. When probabilities for the next token have been generated, it has a certain propensity for using a particular word; but if that word is artificially blocked, other ways of saying the same thing also have been activated and will be used instead. It is reasonable to interpret this as having an &#x201C;idea&#x201D; of what it &#x201C;wants&#x201D; to &#x201C;say&#x201D; and at some point the quotation marks are no longer helpful, and we may as well dispense with them.</p><p><br>Here is an example. I input the following prompt into GPT-2 1.5B, with top-k=10 sampling:</p><p><br><strong>&quot;Indiana Jones ducked as he entered the cave to avoid being decapitated.&quot; In this sentence, the word &quot;decapitated&quot; means</strong></p><p><br>Here are the first 10 results (truncated after the first sentence):<br>&#x2022;	&quot;to be cut down&quot; as well as &quot;to be slain.&quot; <br>&#x2022;	&quot;to chop off&quot;. <br>&#x2022;	&quot;to cut off one of the branches of a tree.&quot; <br>&#x2022;	&quot;The captain of the ship was killed in the cave.&quot; <br>&#x2022;	&quot;to cut off, cut off by decapitation.&quot; <br>&#x2022;	&quot;cut off&quot;. <br>&#x2022;	&quot;cut off.&quot; <br>&#x2022;	to be &quot;sliced off.&quot; <br>&#x2022;	&quot;to be killed,&quot; which is the same thing as &quot;to be killed by the sword.&quot; <br>&#x2022;	to fall from high altitude or to be cut down. <br>&#x2022;	&quot;to have a head chopped off.&quot; </p><p><br>The system has a strong notion that &#x201C;decapitated&quot; means &#x201C;to cut off&#x201D; and &#x201C;to kill&#x201D; but is less likely to mention that the word has anything to do with a head. So its concept of &#x201C;decapitation&#x201D; appears to be approximately (but not completely) right. When prompted to write a sentence using the word &#x201C;decapitate,&#x201D; the sentences the system usually generates are consistent with this, often being used in a way consistent with killing, but only rarely mentioning heads. (This has all gotten rather grisly.)</p><p><br>However, one shouldn&apos;t take this too far. GPT-2 uses concepts in a very different way than a person does. In the paper &#x201C;<a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.11931.pdf"">Evaluating Commonsense in Pre-trained Language Models,</a>&#x201D; the probability of generating each of a pair of superficially similar sentences is measured. If the system is correctly and consistently applying a concept, then one of the two sentences will have a high probability and the other a low probability of being generated. For example, given the four sentences</p><p><br>1.	People need to use their air conditioner on a hot day. <br>2.	People need to use their air conditioner on a lovely day. <br>3.	People don&#x2019;t need to use their air conditioner on a hot day. <br>4.	People don&#x2019;t need to use their air conditioner on a lovely day. </p><p><br>Sentences 1 and 4 should have higher probability than sentences 2 and 3. What they find is that GPT-2 does worse than chance on these kinds of problems. If a sentence is likely, a variation on the sentence with opposite meaning tends to have similar likelihood. The same problem occurred with word vectors, like word2vec. &#x201C;Black&#x201D; is the opposite of &#x201C;white,&#x201D; but except in the one dimension they differ, nearly everything else about them is the same: you can buy a white or black crayon, you can paint a wall white or black, you can use white or black to describe a dog&#x2019;s fur. Because of this, black and white are semantically close, and tend to get confused with each other.</p><p><br>The underlying reason for this issue appears to be that GPT-2 has only ever seen sentences that make sense, and is trying to generate sentences that are similar to them. It has never seen sentences that do NOT make sense and makes no effort to avoid them. The paper <a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.03860.pdf"">&#x201C;Don&apos;t Say That! Making Inconsistent Dialogue Unlikely with Unlikelihood Training&#x201D;</a> introduces such an  &#x201C;unlikelihood objective&#x201D; and shows it can help with precisely the kinds of problems mentioned in the previous paper, as well as GPT-2&#x2019;s tendency to get stuck in endless loops.</p><p><br>Despite all this, when generating text, GPT-2 is more likely to generate a true sentence than the opposite of a true sentence. &#x201C;Polar bears are found in the Arctic&#x201D; is far more likely to be generated than &#x201C;Polar bears are found in the tropics,&#x201D; and it is also more likely to be generated than &#x201C;Polar bears are not found in the Arctic&#x201D; because &#x201C;not found&#x201D; is a less likely construction to be used in real writing than &#x201C;found.&#x201D;</p><p><br>It appears that what GPT-2 knows is that the concept <em>polar bear</em> has a <em>found in</em> relation to <em>Arctic</em> but that it is not very particular about the polarity of that relation (<em>found in</em> vs. <em>not found in</em>.) It simply defaults to expressing the more commonly used positive polarity much of the time.</p><p><br>Another odd feature of GPT-2 is that its writing expresses equal confidence in concepts and relationships it knows very well, and those it knows very little about. By looking into the probabilities, we can often determine when GPT-2 is uncertain about something, but this uncertainty is not expressed in the sentences it generates. By the same token, if prompted with text that has a lot of hedge words and uncertainty, it will include those words even if it is a topic it knows a great deal about.</p><p><br>Finally, GPT-2 doesn&#x2019;t make any attempt to keep its beliefs consistent with one another. Given the prompt <strong>The current President of the United States is named</strong>, most of the generated responses will be variations on &#x201C;Barack Obama.&#x201D; With other prompts, however, GPT-2 acts as if Donald Trump is the current president. This contradiction was present in the training data, which was created over the course of several years. The token probabilities show that both men&#x2019;s names have fairly high likelihood of being generated for any question of the kind. A person discovering that kind of uncertainty about two options in their mind would modify their beliefs so that one was more likely and the other less likely, but GPT-2 doesn&apos;t have any mechanism to do this and enforce a kind of consistency on its beliefs.</p><p><br>In summary, it seems that GPT-2 does have something that can reasonably be called &#x201C;understanding&#x201D; and holds something very much like &#x201C;concepts&#x201D; or &#x201C;ideas&#x201D; which it uses to generate sentences. However, there are some profound differences between how a human holds and uses ideas and how GPT-2 does, which are important to keep in mind.<br></p>",douglas-summers-stay,douglas-summers-stay,Douglas Summers-Stay,

<h1>Purpose of this post</h1>
<p>In <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/dX7vNKg4vex5vxWCW/making-decisions-under-moral-uncertainty-1"">my prior post</a>, I wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are often forced to make decisions under conditions of uncertainty. This uncertainty can be empirical (e.g., what is the likelihood that nuclear war would cause human extinction?) or <a href=""https://concepts.effectivealtruism.org/concepts/moral-uncertainty/"">moral</a> (e.g., does the wellbeing of future generations matter morally?). The issue of making decisions under empirical uncertainty has been well-studied, and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_utility_hypothesis"">expected utility theory</a> has emerged as the typical account of how a rational agent should proceed in these situations. The issue of making decisions under <em>moral</em> uncertainty appears to have received less attention (though see <a href=""https://philpapers.org/browse/moral-uncertainty"">this list of relevant papers</a>), despite also being of clear importance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I then went on to describe three prominent approaches for dealing with moral uncertainty (based on <a href=""http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/MacAskill-Normative-Uncertainty.pdf"">Will MacAskill’s 2014 thesis</a>):</p>

</ol>
<p>But I was surprised to discover that I couldn’t find any <em>very explicit</em> write-up of how to handle moral and empirical uncertainty <em>at the same time</em>. I assume this is because most people writing on relevant topics consider the approach I will propose in this post to be quite obvious (at least when using MEC with cardinal, intertheoretically comparable, consequentialist theories). Indeed, many existing models from EAs/rationalists (and likely from other communities) already effectively use something very much like the first approach I discuss here (“MEC-E”; explained below), just without explicitly noting that this is an integration of approaches for dealing with moral and empirical uncertainty.<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-sTwHCP7JQg7YPDdFf-3"" id=""fnref-sTwHCP7JQg7YPDdFf-3"">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>But it still seemed worth explicitly spelling out the approach I propose, which is, in a nutshell, using exactly the regular approaches to moral uncertainty mentioned above, but on <em>outcomes</em> rather than on <em>actions</em>, and combining that with consideration of the likelihood of each action leading to each outcome. My aim for this post is both to make this approach “obvious” to a broader set of people and to explore how it can work with non-comparable, ordinal, and/or non-consequentialist theories (which may be less obvious).</p>
<p>(Additionally, as a side-benefit, readers who are wondering what on earth all this “modelling” business some EAs and rationalists love talking about is, or who are only somewhat familiar with modelling, may find this post to provide useful examples and explanations.)</p>
<p>I'd be interested in any comments or feedback you might have on anything I discuss here!</p>
<h1>MEC under empirical uncertainty</h1>
<p>To briefly review regular MEC: <a href=""http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/MacAskill-Normative-Uncertainty.pdf"">MacAskill</a> argues that, when all moral theories under consideration are cardinal and intertheoretically comparable, a decision-maker should choose the “option” that has the highest <em>expected choice-worthiness</em>. Expected choice-worthiness is given by the following formula:</p>
<p><img src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/dwbqmbkdb/image/upload/v1577669360/MEC_formula_pymz12.jpg"" alt=""""></p>
<p>In this formula, <em>C(Ti)</em> represents the decision-maker’s credence (belief) in <em>Ti</em> (some particular moral theory), while <em>CWi(A)</em> represents the “choice-worthiness” (<em>CW</em>) of <em>A</em> (an “option” or action that the decision-maker can choose) according to <em>Ti</em>. In <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/dX7vNKg4vex5vxWCW/making-decisions-under-moral-uncertainty-1"">my prior post</a>, I illustrated how this works with this example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Suppose Devon assigns a 25% probability to T1, a version of hedonistic utilitarianism in which human “<a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Hedon"">hedons</a>” (a hypothetical unit of pleasure) are worth 10 times more than fish hedons. He also assigns a 75% probability to T2, a different version of hedonistic utilitarianism, which values human hedons just as much as T1 does, but doesn’t value fish hedons at all (i.e., it sees fish experiences as having no moral significance). Suppose also that Devon is choosing whether to buy a fish curry or a tofu curry, and that he’d enjoy the fish curry about twice as much. (Finally, let’s go out on a limb and assume Devon’s humanity.)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>According to T1, the choice-worthiness (roughly speaking, the rightness or wrongness of an action) of buying the fish curry is -90 (because it’s assumed to cause 1,000 negative fish hedons, valued as -100, but also 10 human hedons due to Devon’s enjoyment). In contrast, according to T2, the choice-worthiness of buying the fish curry is 10 (because this theory values Devon’s joy as much as T1 does, but doesn’t care about the fish’s experiences). Meanwhile, the choice-worthiness of the tofu curry is 5 according to both theories (because it causes no harm to fish, and Devon would enjoy it half as much as he’d enjoy the fish curry).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[...] Using MEC in this situation, the expected choice-worthiness of buying the fish curry is 0.25 * -90 + 0.75 * 10 = -15, and the expected choice-worthiness of buying the tofu curry is 0.25 * 5 + 0.75 * 5 = 5. Thus, Devon should buy the tofu curry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But can Devon really be <em>sure</em> that buying the fish curry will lead to that much fish suffering? What if this demand signal doesn’t lead to increased fish farming/capture? What if the additional fish farming/capture is more humane than expected? What if fish can’t suffer because they aren’t actually conscious (empirically, rather than as a result of what sorts of consciousness our moral theory considers relevant)? We could likewise question Devon’s apparent certainty that buying the tofu curry <em>definitely won’t</em> have any unintended consequences for fish suffering, and his apparent certainty regarding precisely how much he’d enjoy each meal.</p>
<p>These are all empirical rather than moral questions, but they still seem very important for Devon’s ultimate decision. This is because <strong>T1 and T2 don’t “<em>intrinsically</em> care” about whether someone buys fish curry or buys tofu curry; these theories assign no <em>terminal value</em> to which curry is bought. Instead, these theories ""care"" about some of the <em>outcomes</em> which those actions may or may not cause.</strong><sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-sTwHCP7JQg7YPDdFf-4"" id=""fnref-sTwHCP7JQg7YPDdFf-4"">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>More generally, I expect that, in all realistic decision situations, we’ll have <em>both</em> moral <em>and</em> empirical uncertainty, and that it’ll often be important to <em>explicitly consider both types of uncertainties</em>. For example, GiveWell’s models consider both how likely insecticide-treated bednets are to save the life of a child, and how that outcome would compare to doubling the income of someone in extreme poverty. However, typical discussions of MEC seem to assume that we already know for sure what the outcomes of our actions will be, just as typical discussions of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value"">expected value</a> reasoning seem to assume that we already know for sure how valuable a given outcome is.</p>
<p>Luckily, it seems to me that MEC and traditional (empirical) expected value reasoning can be very easily and neatly integrated in a way that resolves those issues. (This is perhaps partly due to that fact that, if I understand MacAskill’s thesis correctly, MEC was very consciously developed by analogy to expected value reasoning.) Here is my formula for this integration, which I'll call <em>Maximising Expected Choice-worthiness, accounting for Empirical uncertainty (MEC-E)</em>, and which I'll explain and provide an example for below:</p>
<p><img src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/dwbqmbkdb/image/upload/v1577946182/MEC-E_formula_iitmrf.gif"" alt=""""></p>
<p>Here, all symbols mean the same things they did in the earlier formula from MacAskill’s thesis, with two exceptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>I’ve added <em>Oj</em>, to refer to each “outcome”: each consequence that an action may lead to, which at least one moral theory under consideration intrinsically values/disvalues. (E.g., a fish suffering; a person being made happy; rights being violated.)</li>
<li>Related to that, I’d like to be more explicit that <em>A</em> refers <em>only</em> to the “actions” that the decision-maker can directly choose (e.g., purchasing a fish meal, imprisoning someone), rather than the outcomes of those actions.<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-sTwHCP7JQg7YPDdFf-5"" id=""fnref-sTwHCP7JQg7YPDdFf-5"">[5]</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>(I also re-ordered the choice-worthiness term and the credence term, which makes no actual difference to any results, and was just because I think this ordering is slightly more intuitive.)</p>
<p>Stated verbally (and slightly imprecisely<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-sTwHCP7JQg7YPDdFf-6"" id=""fnref-sTwHCP7JQg7YPDdFf-6"">[6]</a></sup>), MEC-E claims that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One should choose the action which maximises expected choice-worthiness, accounting for empirical uncertainty. To calculate the expected choice-worthiness of each action, you first, for each potential outcome of the action and each moral theory under consideration, find the product of 1) the probability of that outcome given that that action is taken, 2) the choice-worthiness of that outcome according to that theory, and 3) the credence given to that theory. Second, for each action, you sum together all of those products.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To illustrate, I have <a href=""https://www.getguesstimate.com/models/14802"">modelled in Guesstimate</a> an extension of the example of Devon deciding what meal to buy to also incorporate empirical uncertainty.<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-sTwHCP7JQg7YPDdFf-7"" id=""fnref-sTwHCP7JQg7YPDdFf-7"">[7]</a></sup> In the text here, I will only state the information that was not in the earlier version of the example, and the resulting calculations, rather than walking through all the details.</p>
<p>Suppose Devon believes there’s an 80% chance that buying a fish curry will lead to “fish being harmed” (modelled as 1000 negative fish hedons, with a choice-worthiness of -100 according to T1 and 0 according to T2), and a 10% chance that buying a tofu curry will lead to that same outcome. He also believes there’s a 95% chance that buying a fish curry will lead to “Devon enjoying a meal a lot” (modelled as 10 human hedons), and a 50% chance that buying a tofu curry will lead to that.</p>
<p>The expected choice-worthiness of buying a fish curry would therefore be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(0.8 * -100 * 0.25) + (0.8 * 0 * 0.75) + (0.95 * 10 * 0.25) + (0.95 * 10 * 0.75) = -10.5</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, the expected choice-worthiness of buying a tofu curry would be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(0.1 * -100 * 0.25) + (0.1 * 0 * 0.75) + (0.5 * 10 * 0.25) + (0.5 * 10 * 0.75) = 2.5</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As before, the tofu curry appears the better choice, despite seeming somewhat worse according to the theory (T2) assigned higher credence, because the other theory (T1) sees the tofu curry as <em>much</em> better.</p>
<p>In the final section of this post, I discuss potential extensions of these approaches, such as how it can handle probability distributions (rather than point estimates) and non-consequentialist theories.</p>
<p>The last thing I’ll note about MEC-E in this section is that MEC-E can be used as a heuristic, without involving actual numbers, in exactly the same way MEC or traditional expected value reasoning can. For example, without knowing or estimating any actual numbers, Devon might reason that, compared to buying the tofu curry, buying the fish curry is “much” more likely to lead to fish suffering and only “somewhat” more likely to lead to him enjoying his meal a lot. He may further reason that, in the “unlikely but plausible” event that fish experiences <em>do</em> matter, the badness of a large amount of fish suffering is “much” greater than the goodness of him enjoying a meal. He may thus ultimately decide to purchase the tofu curry.</p>
<p>(Indeed, my impression is that many effective altruists have arrived at vegetarianism/veganism through reasoning very much like that, without any actual numbers being required.)</p>
<h1>Normalised MEC under empirical uncertainty</h1>
<p><em>(From here onwards, I’ve had to go a bit further beyond what’s clearly implied by existing academic work, so the odds I’ll make some mistakes go up a bit. Please let me know if you spot any errors.)</em></p>
<p>To briefly review regular <em>Normalised MEC</em>: Sometimes, despite being cardinal, the moral theories we have credence in are <em>not intertheoretically comparable</em> (basically meaning that there’s no consistent, non-arbitrary “exchange rate” between the theories' “units of choice-worthiness""). MacAskill argues that, in such situations, one must first ""normalise"" the theories in some way (i.e., <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalization_(statistics)"">""[adjust] values measured on different scales to a notionally common scale""</a>), and then apply MEC to the new, normalised choice-worthiness scores. He recommends Variance Voting, in which the normalisation is by variance (rather than, e.g., by range), meaning that we:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“[treat] the average of the squared differences in choice-worthiness from the mean choice-worthiness as the same across all theories. Intuitively, the variance is a measure of how spread out choice-worthiness is over different options; normalising at variance is the same as normalising at the difference between the mean choice-worthiness and one standard deviation from the mean choice-worthiness.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(I provide a worked example <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1E0eKGhwCdAXGGFboAAcbg5pWa2HT489oe2XKiruuEp0/edit?usp=sharing"">here</a>, based on an extension of the scenario with Devon deciding what meal to buy, but it's possible I've made mistakes.)</p>
<p>My proposal for <em>Normalised MEC, accounting for Empirical Uncertainty (Normalised MEC-E)</em> is just to combine the ideas of non-empirical Normalised MEC and non-normalised MEC-E in a fairly intuitive way. The steps involved (which may be worth reading alongside <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gxmLMxhNa98syB-zH_SCRJYjM3pWm3McC20qCPihXsM/edit?usp=sharing"">this worked example</a> and/or the earlier explanations of Normalised MEC and MEC-E) are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Work out expected choice-worthiness just as with regular MEC, except that here one is working out the expected choice-worthiness of <em>outcomes</em>, not actions. I.e., for each outcome, multiply that outcome’s choice-worthiness according to each theory by your credence in that theory, and then add up the resulting products.</p>
<ul>
<li>You could also think of this as using the MEC-E formula, except with “Probability of outcome given action” removed for now.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Normalise these expected choice-worthiness scores by variance, just as MacAskill advises in the quote above.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find the “expected value” of each action in the traditional way, with these normalised expected choice-worthiness scores serving as the “value” for each potential outcome. I.e., for each <em>action</em>, multiply the probability it leads to each outcome by the normalised expected choice-worthiness of that outcome (from step 2), and then add up the resulting products.</p>
<ul>
<li>You could think of this as bringing “Probability of outcome given action” back into the MEC-E formula.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choose the action with the maximum score from step 3 (which we could call <em>normalised expected choice-worthiness, accounting for empirical uncertainty</em>, or <em>expected value, accounting for normalised moral uncertainty</em>).<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-sTwHCP7JQg7YPDdFf-8"" id=""fnref-sTwHCP7JQg7YPDdFf-8"">[8]</a></sup></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1>BR under empirical uncertainty</h1>
<p>The final approach MacAskill recommends in his thesis is the Borda Rule (BR; also known as <em>Borda counting</em>). This is used when the moral theories we have credence in are merely <em>ordinal</em> (i.e., they don’t say “how much” more choice-worthy one option is compared to another). In <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/dX7vNKg4vex5vxWCW/making-decisions-under-moral-uncertainty-1"">my prior post</a>, I provided the following quote of MacAskill’s formal explanation of BR (here with “options” replaced by “actions”):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“An [action] <em>A</em>’s <em>Borda Score</em>, for any theory <em>Ti</em>, is equal to the number of [actions] within the [action]-set that are less choice-worthy than <em>A</em> according to theory <em>Ti</em>’s choice-worthiness function, minus the number of [actions] within the [action]-set that are more choice-worthy than <em>A</em> according to <em>Ti</em>’s choice-worthiness function.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>An [action] <em>A</em>’s <em>Credence-Weighted Borda Score</em> is the sum, for all theories <em>Ti</em>, of the Borda Score of <em>A</em> according to theory <em>Ti</em> multiplied by the credence that the decision-maker has in theory <em>Ti</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[The <em>Borda Rule</em> states that an action] <em>A</em> is more appropriate than an [action] <em>B</em> iff [if and only if] <em>A</em> has a higher Credence-Weighted Borda Score than <em>B</em>; <em>A</em> is equally as appropriate as <em>B</em> iff <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> have an equal Credence-Weighted Borda Score.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To apply BR when one is also <em>empirically</em> uncertain, <strong>I propose just explicitly considering/modelling one’s empirical uncertainties, and then figuring out each action’s Borda Score with those empirical uncertainties in mind</strong>. (That is, we don’t change the method at all on a mathematical level; we just make sure each moral theory’s preference rankings over actions - which is used as input into the Borda Rule - takes into account our empirical uncertainty about what outcomes each action may lead to.)</p>
<p>I’ll illustrate how this works with reference to the same example from MacAskill’s thesis that I quoted in my prior post, but now with slight modifications (shown in bold).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Julia is a judge who is about to pass a verdict on whether Smith is guilty for murder. She is very confident that Smith is innocent. There is a crowd outside, who are desperate to see Smith convicted. Julia has three options:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[G]: Pass a verdict of ‘guilty’.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[R]: Call for a retrial.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[I]: Pass a verdict of ‘innocent’.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>She thinks there’s a 0% chance of M if she passes a verdict of guilty, a 30% chance if she calls for a retrial (there may mayhem due to the lack of a guilty verdict, or later due to a later innocent verdict), and a 70% chance if she passes a verdict of innocent.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There’s obviously a 100% chance of C if she passes a verdict of guilty and a 0% chance if she passes a verdict of innocent. She thinks there’s also a 20% chance of C happening later if she calls for a retrial.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Julia believes the crowd is very likely (~90% chance) to</strong> riot if Smith is found innocent, causing mayhem on the streets and the deaths of several people. If she calls for a retrial, she <strong>believes it’s almost certain (~95% chance)</strong> that he will be found innocent at a later date, and that it is much less likely <strong>(only ~30% chance)</strong> that the crowd will riot at that later date <strong>if he is found innocent then</strong>. If she declares Smith guilty, the crowd will <strong>certainly (~100%)</strong> be appeased and go home peacefully. She has credence in three moral theories**, which, <em>when taking the preceding probabilities into account</em>, provide the following choice-worthiness orderings**:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>35% credence in a variant of utilitarianism, according to which [G≻<strong>I≻R</strong>].</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>34% credence in a variant of common sense, according to which [<strong>I&gt;R</strong>≻G].</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>31% credence in a deontological theory, according to which [I≻R≻G].”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This leads to the Borda Scores and Credence-Weighted Borda Scores shown in the table below, and thus to the recommendation that Julia declare Smith innocent.</p>
<p><img src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/dwbqmbkdb/image/upload/v1577946192/Borda_table_with_empirical_dm6xid.png"" alt=""""></p>
<p>(More info on how that was worked out can be found in the following footnote, along with the corresponding table based on the moral theories' preference orderings in my prior post, when empirical uncertainty <em>wasn't</em> taken into account.<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-sTwHCP7JQg7YPDdFf-9"" id=""fnref-sTwHCP7JQg7YPDdFf-9"">[9]</a></sup>)</p>
<p>In the original example, both the utilitarian theory and the common sense theory preferred a retrial to a verdict of innocent (in order to avoid a riot), which resulted in calling for a retrial having the highest Credence-Weighted Borda Score.</p>
<p>However, I’m now imagining that <strong>Julia is no longer assuming each action 100% guarantees a certain outcome will occur, and paying attention to her empirical uncertainty has changed her conclusions</strong>.</p>
<p>In particular, I’m imagining that she realises she’d initially been essentially “rounding up” (to 100%) the likelihood of a riot if she provides a verdict of innocent, and “rounding down” (to 0%) the likelihood of the crowd rioting at a later date. However, with more realistic probabilities in mind, utilitarianism and common sense would both actually prefer an innocent verdict to a retrial (because the innocent verdict seems less risky, and the retrial more risky, than she’d initially thought, while an innocent verdict still frees this innocent person sooner and with more certainty). This changes each action’s Borda Score, and gives the result that she should declare Smith innocent.<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-sTwHCP7JQg7YPDdFf-10"" id=""fnref-sTwHCP7JQg7YPDdFf-10"">[10]</a></sup></p>
<h1>Potential extensions of these approaches</h1>
<h2>Does this approach presume/privilege consequentialism?</h2>
<p>A central idea of this post has been making a clear distinction between “actions” (which one can directly choose to take) and their “outcomes” (which are often what moral theories “intrinsically care about”). This clearly makes sense when the moral theories one has credence in are consequentialist. However, other moral theories may “intrinsically care” about actions themselves. For example, many deontological theories would consider lying to be wrong <em>in and of itself</em>, regardless of what it leads to. Can the approaches I’ve proposed handle such theories?</p>
<p>Yes - and very simply! For example, suppose I wish to use MEC-E (or Normalised MEC-E), and I have credence in a (cardinal) deontological theory that assigns very low choice-worthiness to lying (regardless of outcomes that action leads to). We can still calculate expected choice-worthiness using the formulas shown above; in this case, we find the product of (multiply) “probability me lying leads to me having lied” (which we’d set to 1), “choice-worthiness of me having lied, according to this deontological theory”, and “credence in this deontological theory”.</p>
<p>Thus, cases where a theory cares intrinsically about the action and not its consequences can be seen as a “special case” in which the approaches discussed in this post just collapse back to the corresponding approaches discussed in MacAskill’s thesis (which these approaches are the “generalised” versions of). This is because there’s effectively no empirical uncertainty in these cases; we can be sure that taking an action would lead to us having taken that action. Thus, in these and other cases of no relevant empirical uncertainty, accounting for empirical uncertainty is unnecessary, but creates no problems.<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-sTwHCP7JQg7YPDdFf-11"" id=""fnref-sTwHCP7JQg7YPDdFf-11"">[11]</a></sup><sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-sTwHCP7JQg7YPDdFf-12"" id=""fnref-sTwHCP7JQg7YPDdFf-12"">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>I’d therefore argue that a policy of using the generalised approaches by default is likely wise. This is especially the case because:</p>
<ul>
<li>One will typically have at least <em>some</em> credence in consequentialist theories.</li>
<li>My impression is that even most “non-consequentialist” theories still do care at least <em>somewhat</em> about consequences. For example, they’d likely say lying is in fact “right” if the negative consequences of not doing so are “large enough” (and one should often be empirically uncertain about whether they would be).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Factoring things out further</h2>
<p>In this post, I modified examples (from my prior post) in which we had only one moral uncertainty into examples in which we had one moral and one empirical uncertainty. We could think of this as “factoring out” what originally appeared to be only moral uncertainty into its “factors”: empirical uncertainty about whether an action will lead to an outcome, and moral uncertainty about the value of that outcome. By doing this, we’re more closely approximating (modelling) our actual understandings and uncertainties about the situation at hand.</p>
<p>But we’re still far from a full approximation of our understandings and uncertainties. For example, in the case of Julia and the innocent Smith, Julia may also be uncertain how big the riot would be, how many people would die, whether these people would be rioters or uninvolved bystanders, whether there’s a moral difference between a rioter vs a bystanders dying from the riot (and if so, how big this difference is), etc.<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-sTwHCP7JQg7YPDdFf-13"" id=""fnref-sTwHCP7JQg7YPDdFf-13"">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>A benefit of the approaches shown here is that they can very simply be extended, with typical modelling methods, to incorporate additional uncertainties like these. You simply disaggregate the relevant variables into the “factors” you believe they’re composed of, assign them numbers, and multiply them as appropriate.<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-sTwHCP7JQg7YPDdFf-14"" id=""fnref-sTwHCP7JQg7YPDdFf-14"">[14]</a></sup><sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-sTwHCP7JQg7YPDdFf-15"" id=""fnref-sTwHCP7JQg7YPDdFf-15"">[15]</a></sup></p>
<h2>Need to determine whether uncertainties are moral or empirical?</h2>
<p>In the examples given just above, you may have wondered whether I was considering certain variables to represent moral uncertainties or empirical ones. I suspect this ambiguity will be common in practice (and I plan to discuss it further in a later post). Is this an issue for the approaches I’ve suggested?</p>
<p>I’m a bit unsure about this, but I think the answer is essentially “no”. I don’t think there’s any need to treat moral and empirical uncertainty in <em>fundamentally</em> different ways for the sake of models/calculations using these approaches. Instead, I think that, ultimately, the important thing is just to “factor out” variables in the way that makes the most sense, given the situation and what the moral theories under consideration “intrinsically care about”. (An example of the sort of thing I mean can be found in footnote 14, in a case where the uncertainty is actually empirical but has different moral implications for different theories.)</p>
<h2>Probability distributions instead of point estimates</h2>
<p>You may have also thought that a lot of variables in the examples I’ve given should be represented by probability distributions (e.g., representing 90% confidence intervals), rather than point estimates. For example, why would Devon estimate the probability of “fish being harmed”, as if it’s a binary variable whose moral significance switches suddenly from 0 to -100 (according to T1) when a certain level of harm is reached? Wouldn’t it make more sense for him to estimate the <em>amount</em> of harm to fish that is likely, given that that better aligns both with his understanding of reality and with what T1 cares about?</p>
<p>If you were thinking this, I wholeheartedly agree! Further, I can’t see any reason why the approaches I’ve discussed <em>couldn’t</em> use probability distributions and model variables as continuous rather than binary (the only reason I haven’t modelled things in that way so far was to keep explanations and examples simple). For readers interested in an illustration of how this can be done, I’ve provided a modified model of the Devon example in <a href=""https://www.getguesstimate.com/models/14811"">this Guesstimate model</a>. (Existing models like <a href=""https://www.getguesstimate.com/models/11762"">this one</a> also take essentially this approach.)</p>
<h1>Closing remarks</h1>
<p>I hope you’ve found this post useful, whether to inform your heuristic use of moral uncertainty and expected value reasoning, to help you build actual models taking into account both moral and empirical uncertainty, or to give you a bit more clarity on “modelling” in general.</p>
<p>In the next post, I’ll discuss how we can combine the approaches discussed in this and my prior post with sensitivity analysis and value of information analysis, to work out what specific moral or empirical learning would be most decision-relevant and when we should vs shouldn’t postpone decisions until we’ve done such learning.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Choice-worthiness</em> is the rightness or wrongness of an action, according to a particular moral theory.</li>
<li>A moral theory is <em>ordinal</em> if it tells you only which options are better than which other options, whereas a theory is <em>cardinal</em> if it tells you <em>how big a difference</em> in choice-worthiness there is between each option.</li>
<li>A pair of moral theories can be cardinal and yet still <em>not intertheoretically comparable</em> if we cannot meaningfully compare the sizes of the “differences in choice-worthiness” between the theories; basically, if there’s no consistent, non-arbitrary “exchange rate” between different theories’ “units of choice-worthiness”.</li>

I therefore don't know for sure whether my original proposal would work or not (and, if it does work, whether it’s somehow better than what I proposed above). My original proposal was as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Work out expected choice-worthiness just as with regular MEC-E; i.e., follow the formula from above to incorporate consideration of the probabilities of each action leading to each outcome, the choice-worthiness of each outcome according to each moral theory, and the credence one has in each theory. (But don’t yet pick the action with the maximum expected choice-worthiness score.)</li>
<li>Normalise these expected choice-worthiness scores by variance, just as MacAskill advises in the quote above. (The fact that these scores incorporate consideration of empirical uncertainty has no impact on how to normalise by variance.)</li>

<p>Another perk is that paying attention to both moral and empirical uncertainty also provides more clarity on what the decision-maker should think or learn more about. This will be the subject of my next post. For now, a quick example is that Julia may realise that a lot hangs on what each moral theory’s preference ordering should actually be, or on how likely the crowd actually is to riot if she passes a verdict or innocent or calls for a retrial, and it may be worth postponing her decision in order to learn more about these things. <a href=""#fnref-sTwHCP7JQg7YPDdFf-10"" class=""footnote-backref"">↩︎</a></p>

It may often be reasonable to round this to 1 or 0, in which case these approaches didn’t necessarily “add value” (though they still worked).

<li id=""fn-sTwHCP7JQg7YPDdFf-14"" class=""footnote-item""><p>For example, Devon might replace “Probability that purchasing a fish meal leads to ""fish being harmed""” with (“Probability that purchasing a fish meal leads to fish being killed” * “Probability fish who were killed would be killed in a non-humane way” * “Probability any fish killed in these ways would be conscious enough that this can count as “harming” them”). This whole term would then be in calculations used wherever ““Probability that purchasing a fish meal leads to ""fish being harmed""” was originally used.</p>
<p>For another example, Julia might replace “Probability the crowd riots if Julia finds Smith innocent” with “Probability the crowd riots if Julia finds Smith innocent” * “Probability a riot would lead to at least one death” * “Probability that, if at least one death occurs, there’s at least one death of a bystander (rather than of one of the rioters themselves)” (as shown in <a href=""https://www.getguesstimate.com/models/14810"">this partial Guesstimate model</a>). She can then keep in mind <em>this more specific final outcome, and its more clearly modelled probability</em>, as she tries to work out what choice-worthiness ordering each moral theory she has credence in would give to the actions she’s considering.</p>
<p>Note that, sometimes, it might make sense to “factor out” variables in different ways for the purposes of different moral theories’ evaluations, depending on what the moral theories under consideration “intrinsically care about”. In the case of Julia, it definitely seems to me to make sense to replace “Probability the crowd riots if Julia finds Smith innocent” with “Probability the crowd riots if Julia finds Smith innocent” * “Probability a riot would lead to at least one death”. This is because all moral theories under consideration probably care far more about potential deaths from a riot than about any other consequences of the riot. This can therefore be considered an “empirical uncertainty”, because its influence on the ultimate choice-worthiness “flows through” the same “moral outcome” (a death) for all moral theories under consideration.</p>
<p>However, it might only make sense to further multiply that term by “Probability that, if at least one death occurs, there’s at least one death of a bystander (rather than of one of the rioters themselves)” for the sake of the common sense theory’s evaluation of the choice-worthiness order, not for the utilitarian theory’s evaluation. This would be the case if the utilitarian theory cared not at all (or at least much less) about the distinction between the death of a rioter and the death of a bystander, while common sense does.

In transhumanist thinking, these dimensions tend to be characteristics of individuals: their happiness, longevity, intelligence, and so on. [1] This reflects the deeply individualistic nature of our modern societies overall, and transhumanists in particular. Yet when asked what makes their lives meaningful, <u><a href=""https://www.pewforum.org/2018/11/20/where-americans-find-meaning-in-life/"">most people</a></u> prioritise their relationships with others. In contrast, there are strands of utopian literature which focus on social reorganisation (such as Huxley&#x2019;s <em>Island</em> or Skinner&#x2019;s <em>Walden Two</em>), but usually without acknowledging the potential of technology to radically improve the human condition. [2] Meanwhile, utilitarians conceive of the best future as whichever one maximises a given metric of individual welfare - but those metrics are often criticised for oversimplifying the range of goods that people actually care about. [3] In this essay I&apos;ve tried to be as comprehensive as possible in cataloguing the ways that the future could be much better than the present, which I&apos;ve divided into three categories: individual lives, relationships with others, and humanity overall. Each section consists of a series of bullet points, with nested elaborations and examples.<br><br>I hesitated for quite some time before making this essay public, though, because it feels a little naive. Partly that&#x2019;s because the different claims don&#x2019;t form a single coherent narrative. But on reflection I think I endorse that: <u><a href=""http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/11/abstractdistant.html"">grand narratives are more seductive</a></u> but also more likely to totally miss the point. Additionally, <u><a href=""https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/holden-karnofsky-open-philanthropy/"">Holden Karnofsky has found</a></u> that &#x201C;the mere act of describing [a utopia] makes it sound top-down and centralized&#x201D; in a way which people dislike - another reason why discussing individual characteristics is probably more productive.<br><br>Another concern is that even though there&#x2019;s a strong historical trend towards increases in material quality of life, the same is not necessarily true for social quality of life. Indeed, in many ways the former impedes the latter. In particular, the less time people need to spend obtaining necessities, the more individualistic they&#x2019;re able to be, and the more time they can spend on negative-sum status games. I don&#x2019;t know how to solve this problem, or many others which currently prevent us from building a world that&apos;s good in all the ways I describe below. But I do believe that humanity has the potential to do so. [4] And having a clearer vision of utopia will likely motivate people to work on the problems that stand, as Dickinson put it, &#x201C;between the bliss and me&#x201D;. So what might be amazing about our future?</p><p><strong>Individual lives</strong></p><ul><li><em>Health.</em> Perhaps the clearest and most obvious way to improve the human condition is to cure the diseases and prevent the accidents which currently reduce both the quality and the duration of many people&#x2019;s lives. Mental health problems are particularly neglected right now - solving those could make many people much better off.</li><ul><li><em>Longevity. </em>From some moral stances, the most important of these diseases to tackle is ageing itself, which prevents us from leading fulfilling lives many times longer than what people currently expect. Rejuvenation treatments could grant unlimited youth and postpone death arbitrarily. While the ethics and pragmatics of a post-death society are complicated (<u><a href=""http://thinkingcomplete.blogspot.com/2018/01/is-death-bad.html"">as I discuss here</a></u>), this does not seem sufficient reason to tolerate the moral outrage of involuntary mortality.</li></ul><li><em>Wealth</em>. Nobody should lack access to whatever material goods they need to lead fulfilling lives. As technology advances and we automate more and more of the economy, the need to work to subsist will diminish, and eventually vanish altogether. An extrapolation from the last few centuries of development predicts that with centuries almost everyone will be incredibly wealthy by today&#x2019;s standards. Luxuries that are now available only to a few (or to none at all) will become widespread.</li><ul><li><em>Life in simulation. </em>In the long term, the most complete way to achieve these two goals may be for us to spend almost all of our time in virtual reality, where possessions can be generated on demand, physical inconveniences will be eliminated, and our experiences will be limited only by our imaginations. Eventually this will likely lead to us uploading our minds and permanently inhabiting vast, shared virtual worlds. The key ideas in all of the points that follow this one are applicable whether we inhabit physical or virtual realities.</li></ul><li><em>Alleviation of suffering</em>. Evolution has stacked the hedonic deck against us: the extremes of pain are much greater than the extremes of pleasure, and more easily accessible too. But bioengineering and neuroscience will eventually reach a point where we could move towards eradicating suffering (including mental anguish and despair) and fulfilling the goal of David Pearce&apos;s <u><a href=""https://www.hedweb.com/"">abolitionist project</a></u>. Perhaps keeping something similar to physical pain or mental frustration would still be useful for adding spice or variety to our lives - but it need not be anywhere near the worst and most hopeless extremes of either.</li><ul><li><em>Freedom from violence and coercion. </em>As part of this project, any utopia must prevent man&#x2019;s inhumanity to man, and the savagery and cruelty which blight human history. This would be the continuation of a <u><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13543093-the-better-angels-of-our-nature"">longstanding trend towards less violent</a></u> and freer societies.</li><li><em>Non-humans. </em>The most horrific suffering which currently exists is not inflicted on humans, but on the trillions of animals with which we share the planet. While most of this essay is focused on human lives and society, preventing the suffering of conscious non-human life (whether animals or aliens or AIs) is a major priority.</li></ul><li><em>Deep pleasure and happiness.</em> Broadly speaking, positive emotions are much more complicated than negative ones. Physical pleasure may be simple, but under the umbrella of happiness I also include excitement, contentment, satisfaction, wonder, joy, love, gratitude, amusement, &#x2018;<u><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)"">flow</a></u>&#x2019;, aesthetic appreciation, the feeling of human connection, and many more!</li><ul><li><em>Better living through chemistry. </em>There&#x2019;s no fundamental reason why our minds couldn&#x2019;t be reconfigured to experience much more of all of the positive emotions I just listed: why the ecstasy of the greatest day of your life couldn&#x2019;t be your baseline state, with most days surging much higher; why all food couldn&#x2019;t taste better than the best food you&#x2019;ve ever had; why everyday activities couldn&#x2019;t be more exhilarating than extreme sports.</li><li><em>Positive attitudes. </em>Our happiness is crucially shaped by our patterns of thought - whether we&#x2019;re optimistic and cheerful about our lives, rather than pessimistic and cynical. While I wouldn&#x2019;t want a society in which people&#x2019;s expectations were totally disconnected from reality, there&#x2019;s a lot of room for people to have healthier mindsets and lead more satisfied lives<em>.</em></li><li><em>Self-worth</em>. In particular, it&#x2019;s important for people to believe that they are valuable and worthwhile. In today&#x2019;s society it&#x2019;s far too easy to be plagued by low self-esteem, which poisons our ability to enjoy what we have.</li><li><em>Peak fun. </em>Our society is already unprecedentedly entertainment-driven. With even fewer material constraints, we will be able to produce <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/qZJBighPrnv9bSqTZ/31-laws-of-fun"">a <em>lot</em> of fun</a></u> activities. Over time this will involve less passive consumption of media and more participation in exciting adventures that become intertwined with the rest of our lives. [5]</li><li><em>New types of happiness</em>. The best experiences won&#x2019;t necessarily come about just by scaling up our existing emotions, but also by creating new ones. Consider that our ability to appreciate music is an evolutionary accident, but one which deeply enriches our current lives. Our future selves could have many more types of experiences deliberately designed to be as rich and powerful as possible.</li></ul><li><em>Choice and self-determination. </em>Humans are more than happiness machines, though. We have dreams about our lives, and we devote ourselves to achieving them. While it&#x2019;s not always straightforwardly good for people to be able to fulfil their desires (in particular desires involving superiority over other people, which I&#x2019;ll discuss later), these activities give us purpose and meaning, and it seems unjust when we are unable to fulfil our plans because we are helpless in the face of external circumstances. Yet neither are the best desires those which can be fulfilled with the snap of a finger, or which steer us totally clear of any hardship. Rather, we should be able to set ourselves goals that are challenging yet achievable, goals which we might struggle with - but whose completion is ultimately even more fulfilling because of that. What might they be?</li><ul><li><em>Making a difference to others</em>. In a utopian future, dramatically improving other people&#x2019;s lives would be much more difficult than it is today. Nevertheless, we can impact others via our relationships with them, as I&#x2019;ll discuss in the next section.</li><li><em>Growth. </em>People often set goals to push themselves, grow more and learn more. In those cases the specific achievements are less relevant than the lessons we take from them.</li><li><em>Tending your garden. </em>Continuous striving isn&#x2019;t for everyone. An alternative is the pursuit of peace and contentment, mindfulness and self-knowledge.</li><li><em>Self-expression. </em>Everyone has a rich inner life, but most of us rarely (or never) find the means to express our true selves. I envisage unlocking the writer or musician or artist inside each of us - so that we can each tell our own story, and endless other stories most beautiful.</li><li><em>Life as art. </em>I picture a world of &#x201C;human beings who are new, unique, incomparable&#x2026; who create themselves!&#x201D; We can think of our lives as canvases upon which we each have the opportunity to paint a masterpiece. For some, that will simply involve pursuing all the other goods I describe in this essay. Others might prioritise making their lives novel, or dramatic, or aesthetically pleasing (even if that makes them less happy).</li><li><em>Life at a larger scale. </em>With more favourable external circumstances, individuals will be able to shape their lives on an unprecedented scale. We could spend centuries on a single project, or muster together billions for vast cooperative ventures. We could also remain the &#x201C;same&#x201D; continuous person as long as we wanted, rather than inevitably losing touch of the past.</li></ul><li><em>Cultivation of virtue. </em>Although less emphasised in modern times, living a good life has long been associated with building character and developing virtues. Doing so is not primarily about changing what happens in our lives, but rather changing how we respond to it. There&#x2019;s no definitive characterisation of a virtuous person, though: we all have our own intuitions about what traits (integrity, kindness, courage, and so on) we admire most in others. And different philosophical traditions emphasise different virtues, from Aristotle&apos;s &apos;greatness of soul&apos; to Confucius&apos; &apos;familial piety&apos; to Buddha&apos;s &#x2018;loving kindness&#x2019; (and the other <u><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmavihara"">brahmaviharas</a></u>). [6] Deciding which virtues are most valuable is a task both for individuals and for society as a whole - with the goal of creating a world of people who have deliberately cultivated the best versions of themselves. [7]</li><li><em>Intelligence. </em>As we are, we can comprehend many complex concepts, but there are whole worlds of thought that human-level intelligences can never fully understand. If a jump from chimpanzee brain size to our brain size opened up such vast cognitive vistas, imagine what else might be possible when we augment our current brains, scale up our intelligence arbitrarily far, and lay bare the patterns that compose the universe.</li><ul><li><em>The joy of learning. </em>Today, learning is usually a chore. Yet humans are fundamentally curious creatures; and there can be deep satisfaction in discovery and understanding. Education should be a game, which we master through play. We might even want to reframe science as a <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/6BFkmEgre7uwhDxDR/p/3diLhMELXxM8rFHJj"">quest for hidden truths</a></u>, so that each person can experience for themselves what it&#x2019;s like to push forward the frontiers of knowledge.</li><li><em>Self-understanding</em>. In many ways, we&#x2019;re inscrutable even to ourselves, with our true beliefs and motivations hidden beneath the surface of consciousness. As we become more intelligent, we will better understand how we really work, fulfilling the longstanding, elusive quest to &#x201C;know thyself&#x201D;.</li><li><em>Agency</em>. Each human is a collection of modules in a constant tug of war. We want one thing one day, and another the next. We procrastinate and we contradict ourselves and we succumb to life-ruining addictions. But this needn&#x2019;t be the case. Imagine yourself as a unified agent, one who is able to make good choices for yourself, and stick to them - one who&#x2019;s not overwhelmed by anger, or addiction, or other desires that your reflective self doesn&#x2019;t endorse. This might be achieved by brain modification, or by having a particularly good AI assistant which knows how to nudge you into being a more consistent version of yourself.</li><li><em>Memory. </em>Today we lose most of our experiences to forgetfulness. But we could (and have already started to) outsource our memories to more permanent storage media accessible demand, so that we can stay in touch with our pasts indefinitely.</li><li><em>The extended mind. </em><u><a href=""https://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1842/1312/TheExtendedMind.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y"">Clark and Chalmers have argued</a></u> that we should consider external thinking aids to be part of our minds. Right now these aids are very primitive, and interface with our brains in very limited ways - but that will certainly improve over time, until accessing the outputs of external computation is similar to any other step in our thinking. The result will be as if we&#x2019;d each internalised all of human knowledge.</li></ul><li><em>Variety and novelty of experiences.</em></li><ul><li><em>Seeing the universe. </em>The urge to travel and explore is a deep-rooted one. Eventually we will be able to roam as far as we like, and observe the wonder and grandeur of the cosmos.</li><li><em>Explorations of the human condition. </em>Most of us inhabit fairly limited social circles, which don&#x2019;t allow us to experience different ways of life and different people&#x2019;s perspectives. Given the time to do so, we could learn a lot from the sheer variety of humanity, and import those lessons into the rest of our lives<em>.</em></li><li><em>Explorations of consciousness</em>. Right now the conscious states that we&#x2019;re able to experience are limited to those induced by the handful of psychoactive chemicals that we or evolution have stumbled upon. Eventually, though, we will develop totally different ways of experiencing the world that are literally inconceivable to us today.</li><li><em>Spiritual experiences. </em>One such mental shift that people already experience is the feeling of spiritual enlightenment. Aside from its religious connotations, this can be a valuable shift of perspective which give us new insights into how to live our lives.</li></ul><li><em>Progress on our journeys. </em>A key part of leading a meaningful life is continual growth and transcendence of one&#x2019;s past self, each moving towards becoming the person we want to be. That might mean becoming a more virtuous person, or more successful, or more fulfilled - as long as we&#x2019;re able to be proud of our achievements so far, and hopeful about the future.</li><ul><li><em><u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/DGXvLNpiSYBeQ6TLW/justified-expectation-of-pleasant-surprises"">Justified expectation of pleasant surprises</a></u>. </em>One important factor in creating this sensation of progress is uncertainty about exactly what the future has in store for us. Although we should be confident that our lives will become better, this should sometimes come in the form of pleasant surprises rather than just ticking off predictable checkpoints.</li><li><em>Levelling up. </em>One way that this growth might occur is if people&#x2019;s lives consist of <u><a href=""http://thinkingcomplete.blogspot.com/2018/04/implementations-of-immortality.html"">distinct phases</a></u>, each with different opportunities and challenges. Once someone thinks they have gained all that they desire from one phase, they can choose to move on. In an extreme case, the nature and goals of a subsequent phase might be incomprehensible to those in earlier phases - in the same way that children don&#x2019;t understand what it&#x2019;s like to be an adult, and most people don&#x2019;t understand Buddhist enlightenment. For fictional precedent, consider sublimation in Banks&#x2019; <em>Culture</em>, or the elves leaving Middle-Earth in Tolkein&#x2019;s mythos.</li><li><em><u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/MTjej6HKvPByx3dEA/devil-s-offers"">Guardrails</a></u>. </em>Extended lives should be very hard to irreversibly screw up, since there&#x2019;s so much at stake - especially if we have much greater abilities to modify ourselves than we do today.<em> </em></li><li><em>Leaving a legacy. </em>People want to be remembered after they&#x2019;ve moved on. Even in a world without death, each person should have had the opportunity to make a lasting difference in their communities before they leave for their next great adventure.</li></ul></ul><p><strong>Relationships with others</strong></p><p>For most of us, our relationships (with friends, family and romantic partners) are what we find most valuable in life. By that metric, though, it&#x2019;s plausible that Westerners are poorer than we&#x2019;ve ever been. What would it mean for our social lives to be as rich as our material lives have and will become? Imagine living in communities and societies that didn&#x2019;t just allow you to pursue your best life, but were actively on your side - that were ideally designed to enable the flourishing of their inhabitants.</p><ul><li><em>Stronger connections. </em>Most relationships are nowhere near as loving or as fulfilling as they might ideally be. That might be because we&#x2019;re afraid of vulnerability, or we don&#x2019;t know how to nurture these relationships (knowing how to be a good friend is more valuable than almost anything learned in classes, but taught almost nowhere), or we simply struggle to find and spend time with people who complement us. Imagine a society which is as successful as solving these problems as ours has been at solving scientific and engineering problems, for example by designing better social norms, giving its citizens more time and space for each other, and teaching individuals to think about their relationships in the most constructive ways.</li><ul><li><em>Abolishing loneliness. </em>I envisage a future where loneliness has been systematically eradicated, by helping everyone find social environments in which they can flourish, and by providing comprehensive support for people struggling with building or maintaining relationships. I imagine too a future without the social anxieties which render many of us insecure and withdrawn.</li><li><em>Love, love, love</em>. What would utopia be without romantic love and passion? This is an obsession of modern culture - and yet it&#x2019;s also something that doesn&#x2019;t always come naturally. We could improve romance by reducing the barriers of fear and insecurity, allowing people to better create true intimacy. Even the prosaic solutions of better educational materials and cultural norms might go a long way towards that.</li><li><em>Commitment and trust. </em>In my mind, the key feature of both romance and friendship is deep commitment and trust, and the common knowledge that you&#x2019;re each there for the other person. Whatever the bottlenecks are to more people building up that sort of bond - inability to communicate openly and honestly; or a lack of empathy; or even the absence of shared adversity - we could focus society&#x2019;s efforts towards remedying.</li><li><em>Free love. </em>While there&#x2019;s excitement in the complex dance of romance, a lot of the hangups around sex serve only to make people anxious and unhappy. Consenting adults should feel empowered to pursue each other; and of course utopia should include some great sex.</li><li><em>Ending toxic relationships</em>. We can reduce and manage the things that make relationships toxic, like jealousy, narcissism, and abuse. This might happen via mental health treatment, better education, better knowledge of how to raise well-socialised children, or cultural norms which facilitate healthy relationships.</li><li><em>Longer connections. </em>I think it&#x2019;s worth noting the positive effect that longevity could have on personal relationships. There&#x2019;s a depth and a joy to being lifelong friends - but how much stronger could it be when those lives stretch out across astronomical timescales? This is not to say that we should bind ourselves to the same people for our whole extended lives - rather, we can spend time together and separate in the knowledge that it need never be a final parting, with each reunion a thing of joy.</li></ul><li><em>Life as a group project. </em>In addition to one-on-one relationships, there&#x2019;s a lot of value in being part of a close-knit group with deep shared bonds - a circle of lifelong friends, or soldiers who trust each other with their lives, or a large and loving family. Many people don&#x2019;t have any of these, but I hope that they could.</li><ul><li><em>Better starts to life. </em>The quality of relationships is most important for the most vulnerable among us. In a utopian future, every child would be raised with love, and allowed to enjoy the wonder of childhood; and indeed, they would keep that same wonder long into their adult lives.</li><li><em>Less insular starts to life. </em>Today, many children only have the opportunity to interact substantively with a handful of adults. While I&#x2019;m unsure about fully-communal parenting, children who will become part of a broader community shouldn&#x2019;t be shut off from that community; rather, they should have the chance to befriend and learn from a range of people. Meanwhile, spending more time with children would enrich the lives of many adults.</li><li><em>Families, extended. </em>What is the most meaningful thing for the most people? Probably spending time with their children and grandchildren, and knowing that with their family they&#x2019;ve created something unique and important. A utopian vision of family would have the same features, but with each person living to see their lineage branch out into a whole forest of descendants, with them at the root.</li></ul><li><em>Healthy societies.</em> In modern times our societies are too large and fragmented to be the close-knit groups I mentioned above. Yet people can also find meaning in being part of something much larger than themselves, and working together towards the common goal of building and maintaining a utopia.</li><ul><li><em>Positive norms. </em>The sort of behaviours that are socially encouraged and rewarded should be prosocial ones which contribute to the well-being of society as a whole.</li><li><em>(The good parts of) tribalism and patriotism. </em>The feeling of being part of a cohesive group of people unified by a common purpose is a powerful one. At a small scale, we currently get this from watching sports, or singing in a choir. At larger scales, those same feelings often lead to harmful nationalist behaviour - yet at their best, they could give us a world in which people feel respect for and fraternity with all those around them by default, simply due to their shared humanity.</li><li><em>Tradition and continuity. </em>Another key component of belonging to something larger than yourself is continuing a long-lived legacy. Traditions could be maintained over many millennia in a way which gives each person a sense of their place in history.</li><li><em>Political voices. </em>Our current societies are too large for their overall directions to be meaningfully influenced by most people. But we can imagine mechanisms which allow individuals to weigh in on important questions in their local communities to a much greater extent. And people could at least know that their voice and vote have as much weight in the largest-scale decisions as anyone else&#x2019;s.</li></ul><li><em>Meetings of minds. </em>Today, humans communicate through words and gestures and body language. These are very low-bandwidth channels, compared with what is theoretically possible. In particular, <u><a href=""https://www.neuralink.com/"">brain interfaces</a></u> could allow direct communication from one person&#x2019;s mind to another. That wouldn&#x2019;t just be quicker talking, but a fundamentally different mode of communication, as if another person were finishing your own thoughts. And consider that our &#x201C;selves&#x201D; are not discrete entities, but are made up of many mental modules. If we link them in new ways, the boundaries between you and other people might become insubstantial - you might temporarily (or permanently) become one larger person.</li><li><em>Mitigating status judgements and dominance-seeking. </em>In general we can&#x2019;t hope to understand social interactions without considering status and hierarchy. We want to date the most attractive people and have the most prestigious jobs and become as wealthy as possible in large part to look better than others. The problem is that not everyone can reach the top, and so widespread competition to do so will leave many dissatisfied. In other cases, people are directly motivated to dominate and outcompete each other - such as businesspeople who want to crush their rivals. While this can be useful for driving progress, in the long term those motivations would ideally be channeled in ways which are more conducive to long-lasting fulfilment. For example, aggressive instincts could be directed towards recreational sports rather than relationships or careers.</li><ul><li><em>Diverse scales of success. </em>To make social dynamics more positive-sum, we should avoid sharing one single vision, which everyone is striving towards, of what a successful life looks. We can instead encourage people to tie their identities to the subcommunities they care most about, rather than measuring themselves against the whole world (though for an objection to this line of reasoning see<a href=""https://meteuphoric.com/2012/07/29/fragmented-status-doesnt-help/""> <u>Katja Grace&#x2019;s post here</u></a>).</li><li><em>More equality of status</em>. To the extent that we still have hierarchies and negative-sum games, it should at least be the case that nobody is consistently at the bottom of all of them, and everyone can look forward to their time of recognition and respect (as in the system I outline in <u><a href=""http://thinkingcomplete.blogspot.com/2018/04/implementations-of-immortality.html"">this blog post</a></u>).</li></ul></ul><p><strong>Humanity overall</strong></p><p>When we zoom out to consider the trajectory of humanity as a whole, there are some desirable properties which we might want it to have. Although there are reasons to distrust such large-scale judgements (in particular the human tendency towards scope insensitivity) these are often strong intuitions which do matter to us.</p><ul><li><em>Sheer size</em>. The more people living worthwhile lives, the better - and with the astronomical resources available to us, we have the opportunity to allow our descendants to number in the uncountable trillions.</li><li><em>Solving coordination. </em>In general, we&#x2019;re bad at working together to resolve problems. This could be solved by mechanisms to make politics and governance transparent, accountable and responsive at a variety of levels. In other words, imagine humanity at one with itself and able to set its overall direction, rather than trapped in our current <u><a href=""https://nickbostrom.com/papers/vulnerable.pdf"">semi-anarchic default condition</a></u>.</li><ul><li><em>The end of war. </em>Others have spoken of the senseless horror of war much better than I can. I will merely add that some human war will be our last war; let us hope that it gains that distinction for the right reason.</li><li><em>Avoiding races to the bottom. </em>Under most people&#x2019;s ethical intuitions, we should dislike <u><a href=""http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/09/this-is-the-dream-time.html"">the Malthusian scenario</a></u> in which, even as our wealth grows vastly, our populations will grow even faster, so that most people end up with subsistence-level resources. To avoid this, we will need to ability to coordinate well at large scales.</li></ul><li><em>The pursuit of knowledge. </em>As a species we will learn and discover more and more over time. Eventually we will understand both the most fundamental building blocks of nature and also the ways in which complex systems like our minds and societies function.</li><li><em>Moral progress</em>. In particular, we will come to a better understanding of ethics, both in theory and in ways that we can actually act upon - and then hopefully do so, to create just societies. While it&#x2019;s difficult to predict exactly where moral progress will take us, one component which seems very important is building a utopia for all, with widespread access to the opportunity to pursue a good life. In particular, this should probably involve everyone having certain basic rights - such as the ability to participate in the major institutions of civil society, as <u><a href=""https://www.philosophy.rutgers.edu/joomlatools-files/docman-files/4ElizabethAnderson.pdf"">Anderson describes</a></u>.</li><li><em>Exploring the diversity of life. </em>Many people value our current world&#x2019;s variety of cultures and lifestyles - but over many millennia our species will be able to explore the vast frontiers of what worthwhile lives and societies could look like. The tree of humanity will branch out in ways that are unimaginable to us now.</li><ul><li><em>Speciation. </em>Even supposing that we are currently alone in the universe, we need not be the last intelligent species. Given sufficient time, it might become desirable to create descendant species, or split humanity into different branches which experience different facets of life. Or we might at least enjoy the companionship of animals, whether they be species that currently exist or those which we create ourselves.</li></ul><li><em>Making our mark</em>. The universe is vast, but we have plenty of time. Humanity could expand to colonise this galaxy, and others, in a continual wave of exploration and pursuit of the unknown. We might create projects of unimaginable scale, reengineering the cosmos as we choose, and diverting the current <u><a href=""https://nickbostrom.com/astronomical/waste.html"">astronomical waste</a></u> towards the well-being of ourselves and our descendants.</li><ul><li><em>Creativity and culture.</em> The ability to create new life, design entire worlds, and perform other large-scale feats, will allow unmatched expressions of artistry and beauty.</li><li><em>Humanity&#x2019;s final flourishing. </em>In the very very long term, under our current understanding of physics, humanity will run out of energy to sustain itself, and our civilisation will draw to an end. If we cannot avoid that, at least we can design our species&#x2019; entire trajectory, including that final outcome, with the wisdom of uncountable millennia.</li></ul></ul><p><strong>Contentious changes</strong></p><p>For all of the changes listed above, there are straightforward reasons why they would be better than the status quo or than a move in the opposite direction. However, there are some dimensions along which we might eventually want to move - but in which direction, I don&#x2019;t know.</p><ul><li><em>Privacy, or lack thereof. </em>In many ways people have become more open over the past few centuries. But we now also place more importance on individual rights such as the right to privacy. I could see a future utopia in which there were very few secrets, and radical transparency was the norm - but also the opposite, in which everyone had full control over which aspects of themselves others could access, even up to their appearance and name (as in <u><a href=""https://www.amazon.co.uk/Quantum-Thief-Hannu-Rajaniemi/dp/0575088893"">this excellent novel)</a></u>.</li><li><em>Connection with nature</em>. Many people value this very highly. By contrast, transhumanists generally want to improve on nature, not return to it. In the long term, we might synthesise these two by creating new environments and ecosystems that are even more peaceful and beautiful and grand those which exist today - but I don&#x2019;t know how well those would match people&#x2019;s current conceptions of natural life.</li><li><em>New social roles</em>. Each of us plays many social roles, and is bound by the corresponding constraints and expectations. I think such roles will be an important part of social interactions even in a utopia: we don&#x2019;t want total homogeneity. However, our current roles - gender roles, family roles, job roles and so on - are certainly not optimal for everyone. I can imagine them being replaced by social roles which are just as strong, but which need to be opted into, or provide more flexibility in other ways. Yet I&#x2019;m hesitant to count this as an unalloyed good, because the new roles might seem bizarre and alien to us, even if our descendants think of them as natural and normal (as illustrated in <u><a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/06/03/asches-to-asches/"">this fascinating story</a></u> by Scott Alexander). Consider, for instance, how strange the hierarchical roles of historical societies seem to us today - and then imagine a future in which our version of romance is just as antiquated, in favour of totally new narratives about what makes relationships meaningful.</li><li><em>Unity versus freedom</em>. Unity of lifestyle and purpose was a key component of many historical utopias. Some more recent utopias, like Banks&#x2019; <em>Culture</em>, propound the exact opposite: total freedom for individuals to live radically diverse lives. Which is better? The temperament of the time urges me towards the latter, which I think is also more intuitive at astronomical scales, but this would also make it harder to implement the other features of the utopia I&#x2019;ve described, if there&#x2019;s extensive disagreement about what goals to pursue, and how. Meanwhile one downside of unity is the necessity of enforcing social norms, for example by ostracising or condemning those who disobey.</li><li><em>The loss or enhancement of individuality. </em>The current composition of our minds - having very high bandwidth between different parts of our brain, and very low bandwidth between our brains and others&#x2019; - is a relic of our evolutionary history. Above, I described the benefits of reducing the communication boundaries between different people. But I&#x2019;m not sure how far to take this: would we want a future in which individuality is obsolete, with everyone merging into larger consciousnesses? Or would it be better if, despite increasing communication bandwidth, we place even greater value on long-term individuality, since our lives will be much less transient?</li><ul><li><em>Cloning and copying. </em>Other technologies which might affect our attitudes towards individuality are those which would allow us to create arbitrarily many people arbitrarily similar to ourselves.</li></ul><li><em>Self-modification. </em>The ability to change arbitrary parts of your mind is a very powerful one. At its best, we can make ourselves the people we always wanted to be, transcending human limitations. At its worst, there might be pressure to carve out the parts of ourselves that make us human, as Scott Alexander <a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/05/28/book-review-age-of-em/"">discusses here</a>.</li><ul><li><em>Designer people</em>. Eventually we will be able to specify arbitrary characteristics of our children, shaping them to an unprecedented extent. However, I don&#x2019;t know if that&#x2019;s a power we should fully embrace, either as individuals or as societies.</li></ul><li><em>Wireheading. </em>I&#x2019;m uncertain about the extent to which blissing out on pleasure (at the expense of pursuing more complex goals) is something we should aim for.</li><li><em>Value drift. </em>More generally, humanity&#x2019;s values will by default change significantly over time. Whether to prevent that or to allow it to happen is a tricky question. The former implies a certain type of stagnation - we are certainly glad that the Ancient Greeks did not lock in their values. The latter option could lead us to a world which looks very weird and immoral by our modern sensibilities.</li></ul><br><h2>Footnotes</h2><p>[1]. See, for instance, the conspicuous absence of relationships and communities in works such as <u><a href=""https://www.nickbostrom.com/views/transhumanist.pdf"">Nick Bostrom&#x2019;s Transhumanist FAQ</a></u>. His summary of the transhumanist perspective: &#x201C;Many transhumanists wish to follow life paths which would, sooner or later, require growing into posthuman persons: they yearn to reach intellectual heights as far above any current human genius as humans are above other primates; to be resistant to disease and impervious to aging; to have unlimited youth and vigor; to exercise control over their own desires, moods, and mental states; to be able to avoid feeling tired, hateful, or irritated about petty things; to have an increased capacity for pleasure, love, artistic appreciation, and serenity; to experience novel states of consciousness that current human brains cannot access.&#x201D; See also Yudkowsky: &#x201C;<u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/pK4HTxuv6mftHXWC3/prolegomena-to-a-theory-of-fun"">It doesn&apos;t get any better than fun.</a></u>&#x201D; Meanwhile the foremost modern science fiction utopia, Banks&#x2019; <em>Culture</em>, is also very individualistic.<br><br>[2].

TB22Snyn7EbaBgGAx,Toy Organ,toy-organ,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/TB22Snyn7EbaBgGAx/toy-organ,2020-01-01T19:30:01.375Z,5,4,1,False,False,,"<p>

A few months ago I brought home an Emenee toy organ someone was
throwing out.  It didn't work, and it sat in the basement for a while,
but today I had a go at fixing it.  It's a very simple design: a fan
blows air through a hole in the bottom, setting up a pressure
difference between the inside and outside.  When you press a key that
opens a corresponding hole and air can flow through, past a little
plastic reed, whose vibration makes the note.



</p><p>

With mine, the motor was running but I wasn't getting any sound.  I
opened it up and nothing was obviously wrong.  I figured it was
probably leaky, and put tape around base where the plastic sides meet
the chipboard bottom.  This fixed it enough to get some sound:

</p>

<p>



<br />

(<a href=""https://youtu.be/dk6o8ytlwK4"">youtube</a>)

</p>

<p>

The lower octave isn't working at all, and the higher notes get
progressively slower to sound and breathier until the very highest
don't sound at all, but this leaves an octave and a half of chromatic
range.  Enough to play around with!

</p>

<p>

The left hand buttons play chords, and are arranged:

</p>

<p>

<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/emenee-organ-left-hand-chords-big.jpg""><img src=""https://www.jefftk.com/emenee-organ-left-hand-chords.jpg"" srcset=""https://www.jefftk.com/emenee-organ-left-hand-chords.jpg 550w, https://www.jefftk.com/emenee-organ-left-hand-chords-2x.jpg 1100w"" /></a>

</p>

<p>

The circle of fifths arrangement makes a lot of sense, but the choice
to put major and minor chords adjacent does not.  If you're playing in
a major key, you generally want the vi and ii minors, so Am and Dm in
the key of C.  This means the vi minors they've included are used in
flatter keys than they've provided: F and C can use Dm and Am, but G
and D would like Em and Bm which are absent.  Shifting the minors over
three notes would be much better.  They layout would change from:

</p>

<pre>
  Bbm  Fm  Cm  Gm  Dm  Am
Bb   F   C   G   D   A
</pre>

to



<pre>
  Gm   Dm  Am  Em  Bm F#m 
Bb   F   C   G   D   A
</pre>

Now in each key you have:



<pre>
  ii  vi
IV  I   V
</pre>

instead of:



<pre>
                    ii  vi
IV  I   V
</pre>



<p>

Playing folk music I also would have preferred that they center on G
or D, since I care much more about having E than Bb.

</p>

<p>

Another change that would be nice would be to offer a way to control
the way air gets into the organ.  There's a hole on the bottom for the
fan, and if you cover it the organ stops working because air can't get
through.  It has a screw-adjustable cover, which looks like it's
designed as a volume control:

</p>

<p>

<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/emenee-organ-adjustible-opening-big.jpg""><img src=""https://www.jefftk.com/emenee-organ-adjustible-opening.jpg"" srcset=""https://www.jefftk.com/emenee-organ-adjustible-opening.jpg 550w, https://www.jefftk.com/emenee-organ-adjustible-opening-2x.jpg 1100w"" /></a>

</p>

<p>

You could build a simple adjustable cover connected to a foot pedal,
and get a real expression pedal.  This would have added to the cost of
the instrument, so I understand why they wouldn't want to do this with
a toy, but it would be a simple-add on.

</p>

<p>

I'm probably not going to keep this, since my regular keyboard can do
everything this can do, so if you're in the Boston area and would
enjoy playing with it let me know!

Beliefs are for mapping reality, so if we're asking the same question and we're doing everything right, we should get the same answer.

<p>In <a href=""https://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/01/the_coin_guessi.html"">""The Coin Guessing Game""</a>, Hal Finney gives a toy model illustrating what the process of convergence looks like in the context of a simple game about inferring the result of a coinflip. A coin is flipped, and two players get a ""hint"" about the result (Heads or Tails) along with an associated hint ""quality"" uniformly distributed between 0 and 1. Hints of quality 1 always match the actual result; hints of quality 0 are useless and might as well be another coinflip. Several ""rounds"" commence where players simultaneously reveal their current guess of the coinflip, incorporating both their own hint and its quality, and what they can infer about the other player's hint quality from their behavior in previous rounds. Eventually, agreement is reached. The process is somewhat alien from a human perspective (when's the last time you and an interlocutor switched sides in a debate <em>multiple times</em> before eventually agreeing?!), but not completely so: if someone whose rationality you trusted seemed visibly unmoved by your strongest arguments, you would infer that they had strong evidence or counterarguments of their own, even if there was some reason they couldn't tell you what they knew.</p>
<p>Honest rational agents should never agree to disagree.</p>
<p>In <a href=""http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/01/disagree_with_s.html"">""Disagree With Suicide Rock""</a>, Robin Hanson discusses a scenario where disagreement seems clearly justified: if you encounter a rock with words painted on it claiming that you, personally, should commit suicide according to your own values, you should feel comfortable disagreeing with the words on the rock without fear of being in violation of the Aumann theorem. The rock is probably just a rock. The words are information from whoever painted them, and maybe that person <em>did</em> somehow know something about whether future observers of the rock should commit suicide, but the rock itself doesn't <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CuSTqHgeK4CMpWYTe/created-already-in-motion"">implement the dynamic</a> of responding to new evidence.</p>
<p>In particular, if you find yourself playing Finney's coin guessing game against a rock with the letter ""H"" painted on it, you should just go with your own hint: it would be incorrect to reason, ""Wow, the rock is still saying Heads, even after observing my belief in several previous rounds; its hint quality must have been <em>very</em> high.""</p>
<p><em>Honest</em> rational agents should never agree to disagree.</p>
<p>Human so-called ""rationalists"" who are aware of this may implicitly or explicitly seek agreement with their peers. If someone whose rationality you trusted seemed visibly unmoved by your strongest arguments, you might think, ""Hm, we still don't agree; I should update towards their position ...""</p>

In particular, when selecting research directions, he looks for techniques that are deeply integrated with the current paradigm, that could scale to AGI and beyond. He also wants the technique to work for agents in general, rather than just question answering systems, since people will want to build agents that can act, at least in the digital world (e.g. composing emails). This has led him to work on <u><a href=""https://medium.com/@deepmindsafetyresearch/scalable-agent-alignment-via-reward-modeling-bf4ab06dfd84"">recursive reward modeling</a></u> (<u><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/f1947668b183/alignment-newsletter-34"">AN #34</a></u>), which tries to solve the specification problem in the <u><a href=""https://medium.com/@deepmindsafetyresearch/building-safe-artificial-intelligence-52f5f75058f1"">SRA framework</a></u> (<u><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/1ecd1b775703/alignment-newsletter-26"">AN #26</a></u>).</p><p>Reward functions are useful because they allow the AI to find novel solutions that we wouldn&apos;t think of (e.g. AlphaGo&apos;s move 37), but often are incorrectly specified, leading to reward hacking. This suggests that we should do <em>reward modeling</em>, where we learn a model of the reward function from human feedback. Of course, such a model is still likely to have errors leading to reward hacking, and so to avoid this, the reward model needs to be updated online. As long as it is <strong>easier to evaluate behavior than to produce behavior</strong>, reward modeling should allow AIs to find novel solutions that we wouldn&apos;t think of.</p><p>However, we would eventually like to apply reward modeling to tasks where evaluation is also hard. In this case, we can decompose the evaluation task into smaller tasks, and recursively apply reward modeling to train AI systems that can perform those small helper tasks. Then, assisted by these helpers, the human should be able to evaluate the original task. This is essentially forming a &quot;tree&quot; of reward modeling agents that are all building up to the reward model for the original, hard task. While currently the decomposition would be done by a human, you could in principle also use recursive reward modeling to automate the decomposition. Assuming that we can get regular reward modeling working robustly, we then need to make sure that the tree of reward models doesn&apos;t introduce new problems. In particular, it might be the case that as you go up the tree, the errors compound: errors in the reward model at the leaves lead to slightly worse helper agents, which lead to worse evaluations for the second layer, and so on.</p><p>He recommends that rather than spending a lot of time figuring out the theoretically optimal way to address a problem, AI safety researchers should alternate between conceptual thinking and trying to make something work. The ML community errs on the other side, where they try out lots of techniques, but don&apos;t think as much about how their systems will be deployed in the real world. Jan also wants the community to focus more on clear, concrete technical explanations, rather than vague blog posts that are difficult to critique and reason about. This would allow us to more easily build on past work, rather than reasoning from first principles and reinventing the wheel many times.</p><p>DeepMind is taking a portfolio approach to AI safety: they are trying many different lines of attack, and hoping that some of them will pan out. Currently, there are teams for agent alignment (primarily recursive reward modeling), incentive theory, trained agent analysis, policy, and ethics. They have also spent some time thinking about AI safety benchmarks, as in <u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.09883"">AI Safety Gridworlds</a></u>, since progress in machine learning is driven by benchmarks, though Jan does think it is quite hard to create a well-made benchmark.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> I&apos;ve become more optimistic about recursive reward modeling since the <u><a href=""https://medium.com/@deepmindsafetyresearch/scalable-agent-alignment-via-reward-modeling-bf4ab06dfd84"">original paper</a></u> (<u><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/f1947668b183/alignment-newsletter-34"">AN #34</a></u>), primarily (I think) because I now see more value in approaches that can be used to perform specific tasks (relative to approaches that try to infer &quot;human values&quot;).</p><p>I also appreciated the recommendations for the AI safety community, and agree with them quite a lot. Relative to Jan, I see more value in conceptual work described using fuzzy intuitions, but I do think that more effort should be put into exposition of that kind of work.</p><h1><strong>Technical AI alignment</strong></h1><h3><strong>Learning human intent</strong></h3><p><u><a href=""https://deepmind.com/blog/article/learning-human-objectives-by-evaluating-hypothetical-behaviours"">Learning human objectives by evaluating hypothetical behaviours</a></u> <em>(Siddharth Reddy et al)</em> (summarized by Rohin): <u><a href=""https://deepmind.com/blog/learning-through-human-feedback/"">Deep RL from Human Preferences</a></u> updated its reward model by collecting human comparisons on on-policy trajectories where the reward model ensemble was most uncertain about what the reward should be. However, we want our reward model to be accurate off policy as well, even in unsafe states. To this end, we would like to train our reward model on <em>hypothetical</em> trajectories. This paper proposes learning a generative model of trajectories from some dataset of environment dynamics, such as safe expert demonstrations or rollouts from a random policy, and then finding trajectories that are &quot;useful&quot; for training the reward model. They consider four different criteria for usefulness of a trajectory: <em>uncertain rewards</em> (which intuitively are areas where the reward model needs training), <em>high rewards</em> (which could indicate reward hacking), <em>low rewards</em> (which increases the number of unsafe states that the reward model is trained on), and <em>novelty</em> (which covers more of the state space). Once a trajectory is generated, they have a human label it as good, neutral, or unsafe, and then train the reward model on these labels.</p><p>The authors are targeting an agent that can <em>explore safely</em>: since they already have a world model and a reward model, they use a model-based RL algorithm to act in the environment. Specifically, to act, they use gradient descent to optimize a trajectory in the latent space that maximizes expected rewards under the reward model and world model, and then take the first action of that trajectory. They argue that the world model can be trained on a dataset of safe human demonstrations (though in their experiments they use rollouts from a random policy), and then since the reward model is trained on hypothetical behavior and the model-based RL algorithm doesn&apos;t need any training, we get an agent that acts without us ever getting to an unsafe state.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> I like the focus on integrating active selection of trajectory queries into reward model training, and especially the four different kinds of active criteria that they consider, and the detailed experiments (including an ablation study) on the benefits of these criteria. These seem important for improving the efficiency of reward modeling.</p><p>However, I don&apos;t buy the argument that this allows us to train an agent without visiting unsafe states. In their actual experiments, they use a dataset gathered from a random policy, which certainly will visit unsafe states. If you instead use a dataset of safe human demonstrations, your generative model will only place probability mass on safe demonstrations, and so you&apos;ll never generate trajectories that visit unsafe states, and your reward model won&apos;t know that they are unsafe. (<em>Maybe</em> your generative model will generalize properly to the unsafe states, but that seems unlikely to me.) Such a reward model will either be limited to imitation learning (sticking to the same trajectories as in the demonstrations, and never finding something like AlphaGo&apos;s move 37), or it will eventually visit unsafe states.</p><p><strong>Read more:</strong> <u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.05652"">Paper: Learning Human Objectives by Evaluating Hypothetical Behavior</a></u></p><p><u><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11979"">Causal Confusion in Imitation Learning</a></u> <em>(Pim de Haan et al)</em> (summarized by Asya): This paper argues that <em>causal misidentification</em> is a big problem in imitation learning. When the agent doesn&apos;t have a good model of what actions cause what state changes, it may mismodel the effects of a state change as a cause-- e.g., an agent learning to drive a car may incorrectly learn that it should turn on the brakes whenever the brake light on the dashboard is on. This leads to undesirable behavior where more information actually causes the agent to perform worse.</p><p>The paper presents an approach for resolving causal misidentification by (1) Training a specialized network to generate a &quot;disentangled&quot; representation of the state as variables, (2) Representing causal relationships between those variables in a graph structure, (3) Learning policies corresponding to each possible causal graph, and (4) Performing targeted interventions, either by querying an expert, or by executing a policy and observing the reward, to find the correct causal graph model.</p><p>The paper experiments with this method by testing it in environments artificially constructed to have confounding variables that correlate with actions but do not cause them. It finds that this method is successfully able to improve performance with confounding variables, and that it performs significantly better per number of queries (to an expert or of executing a policy) than any existing methods. It also finds that directly executing a policy and observing the reward is a more efficient strategy for narrowing down the correct causal graph than querying an expert.</p><p><strong>Asya&apos;s opinion:</strong> This paper goes into detail arguing why causal misidentification is a huge problem in imitation learning and I find its argument compelling. I am excited about attempts to address the problem, and I am tentatively excited about the method the paper proposes for finding representative causal graphs, with the caveat that I don&apos;t feel equipped to evaluate whether it could efficiently generalize past the constrained experiments presented in the paper.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> While the conclusion that more information hurts sounds counterintuitive, it is actually straightforward: you <em>don&apos;t</em> get more data (in the sense of the size of your training dataset); you instead have <em>more features</em> in the input state data. This increases the number of possible policies (e.g. once you add the car dashboard, you can now express the policy &quot;if brake light is on, apply brakes&quot;, which you couldn&apos;t do before), which can make you generalize worse. Effectively, there are more opportunities for the model to pick up on spurious correlations instead of the true relationships. This would happen in other areas of ML as well; surely someone has analyzed this effect for fairness, for example.</p><p>The success of their method over DAgger comes from improved <em>policy exploration</em> (for their environments): if your learned policy is primarily paying attention to the brake light, it&apos;s a very large change to instead focus on whether there is an obstacle visible, and so gradient descent is not likely to ever try that policy once it has gotten to the local optimum of paying attention to the brake light. In contrast, their algorithm effectively trains separate policies for scenarios in which different parts of the input are masked, which means that it is forced to explore policies that depend only on the brake light, and policies that depend only on the view outside the windshield, and so on. So, the desired policy has been explored already, and it only requires a little bit of active learning to identify the correct policy.</p><p>Like Asya, I like the approach, but I don&apos;t know how well it will generalize to other environments. It seems like an example of <u><a href=""https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frobt.2016.00040/full"">quality diversity</a></u>, which I am generally optimistic about.</p><p><u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/WJzsTmsDctYCCyMfy/humans-are-embedded-agents-too"">Humans Are Embedded Agents Too</a></u> <em>(John S Wentworth)</em> (summarized by Rohin): <u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/p7x32SEt43ZMC9r7r/embedded-agents"">Embedded agency</a></u> (<u><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/7d0e3916e3d9/alignment-newsletter-31"">AN #31</a></u>) is not just a problem for AI systems: humans are embedded agents too; many problems in understanding human values stem from this fact. For example, humans don&apos;t have a well-defined output channel: we can&apos;t say &quot;anything that comes from this keyboard is direct output from the human&quot;, because the AI could seize control of the keyboard and wirehead, or a cat could walk over the keyboard, etc. Similarly, humans can &quot;self-modify&quot;, e.g. by drinking, which often modifies their &quot;values&quot;: what does that imply for value learning? Based on these and other examples, the post concludes that &quot;a better understanding of embedded agents in general will lead to substantial insights about the nature of human values&quot;.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> I certainly agree that many problems with figuring out what to optimize stem from embedded agency issues with humans, and any <u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/zvrZi95EHqJPxdgps/why-we-need-a-theory-of-human-values"">formal account</a></u> (<u><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/6751e45fbb48/alignment-newsletter-36"">AN #36</a></u>) of this will benefit from general progress in understanding embeddedness. Unlike many others, I do not think we need a formal account of human values, and that a &quot;common-sense&quot; understanding will suffice, including for the embeddedness problems detailed in this post. (See also this <u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/WJzsTmsDctYCCyMfy/humans-are-embedded-agents-too#opd3EeESfWiEyekDh"">comment thread</a></u> and the next summary.)</p><p><u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/Bxxh9GbJ6WuW5Hmkj/what-s-the-dream-for-giving-natural-language-commands-to-ai"">What&apos;s the dream for giving natural language commands to AI?</a></u> <em>(Charlie Steiner)</em> (summarized by Rohin): We could try creating AI systems that take the &quot;artificial intentional stance&quot; towards humans: that is, they model humans as agents that are trying to achieve some goals, and then we get the AI system to optimize for those inferred goals. We could do this by training an agent that jointly models the world and understands natural language, in order to ground the language into actual states of the world. The hope is that with this scheme, as the agent gets more capable, its understanding of what we want improves as well, so that it is robust to scaling up. However, the scheme has no protection against Goodharting, and doesn&apos;t obviously care about metaethics.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> I agree with the general spirit of &quot;get the AI system to understand common sense; then give it instructions that it interprets correctly&quot;. I usually expect future ML research to figure out the common sense part, so I don&apos;t look for particular implementations (in this case, simultaneous training on vision and natural language), but just assume we&apos;ll have that capability somehow. The hard part is then how to leverage that capability to provide <em>correctly interpreted</em> instructions. It may be as simple as providing instructions in natural language, as this post suggests. I&apos;m much less worried about instrumental subgoals in such a scenario, since part of &quot;understanding what we mean&quot; includes &quot;and don&apos;t pursue this instruction literally to extremes&quot;. But we still need to figure out how to translate natural language instructions into actions.</p><h3><strong>Forecasting</strong></h3><p><u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/XjuT9vgBfwXPxsdfN/might-humans-not-be-the-most-intelligent-animals"">Might humans not be the most intelligent animals?</a></u> <em>(Matthew Barnett)</em> (summarized by Rohin): We can roughly separate intelligence into two categories: <em>raw innovative capability</em> (the ability to figure things out from scratch, without the benefit of those who came before you), and <em>culture processing</em> (the ability to learn from accumulated human knowledge). It&apos;s not clear that humans have the highest raw innovative capability; we may just have much better culture. For example, feral children raised outside of human society look very &quot;unintelligent&quot;, <u><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00WY4OXAS/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1"">The Secret of Our Success</a></u> documents cases where culture trumped innovative capability, and humans actually <em>don&apos;t</em> have the most neurons, or the most neurons in the forebrain.</p><p>(Why is this relevant to AI alignment? Matthew claims that it has implications on AI takeoff speeds, though he doesn&apos;t argue for that claim in the post.)</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> It seems very hard to actually make a principled distinction between these two facets of intelligence, because culture has such an influence over our &quot;raw innovative capability&quot; in the sense of our ability to make original discoveries / learn new things. While feral children might be less intelligent than animals (I wouldn&apos;t know), the appropriate comparison would be against &quot;feral animals&quot; that also didn&apos;t get opportunities to explore their environment and learn from their parents, and even so I&apos;m not sure how much I&apos;d trust results from such a &quot;weird&quot; (evolutionarily off-distribution) setup.</p><p><u><a href=""https://aiimpacts.org/walsh-2017-survey/"">Walsh 2017 Survey</a></u> <em>(Charlie Giattino)</em> (summarized by Rohin): In this survey, AI experts, robotics experts, and the public estimated a 50% chance of high-level machine intelligence (HLMI) by 2061, 2065, and 2039 respectively. The post presents other similar data from the survey.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> While I expected that the public would expect HLMI sooner than AI experts, I was surprised that AI and robotics experts agreed so closely -- I would have thought that robotics experts would have longer timelines.</p><h3><strong>Field building</strong></h3><p><u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/bJdaB2Mz4mBvwFBeb/what-i-talk-about-when-i-talk-about-ai-x-risk-3-core-claims-1"">What I talk about when I talk about AI x-risk: 3 core claims I want machine learning researchers to address.</a></u> <em>(David Krueger)</em> (summarized by Rohin): When making the case for work on AI x-risk to other ML researchers, what should we focus on? This post suggests arguing for three core claims:</p><p>1. Due to Goodhart&apos;s law, instrumental goals, and safety-performance trade-offs, the development of advanced AI increases the risk of human extinction non-trivially.</p><p>2. To mitigate this x-risk, we need to know how to build safe systems, know that we know how to build safe systems, and prevent people from building unsafe systems.</p><p>3. So, we should mitigate AI x-risk, as it is impactful, neglected, and challenging but tractable.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> This is a nice concise case to make, but I think the bulk of the work is in splitting the first claim into subclaims: this is the part that is usually a sticking point (see also the next summary).</p><h3><strong>Miscellaneous (Alignment)</strong></h3><p><u><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/bd2K3Jdz82csjCFob/a-list-of-good-heuristics-that-the-case-for-ai-x-risk-fails"">A list of good heuristics that the case for AI x-risk fails</a></u> <em>(David Krueger)</em> (summarized by Flo): Because human attention is limited and a lot of people try to convince us of the importance of their favourite cause, we cannot engage with everyone&#x2019;s arguments in detail. Thus we have to rely on heuristics to filter out insensible arguments. Depending on the form of exposure, the case for AI risks can fail on many of these generally useful heuristics, eight of which are detailed in this post. Given this outside view perspective, it is unclear whether we should actually expect ML researchers to spend time evaluating the arguments for AI risk.</p><p><strong>Flo&apos;s opinion:</strong> I can remember being critical of AI risk myself for similar reasons and think that it is important to be careful with the framing of pitches to avoid these heuristics from firing. This is not to say that we should avoid criticism of the idea of AI risk, but criticism is a lot more helpful if it comes from people who have actually engaged with the arguments.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> Even after knowing the arguments, I find six of the heuristics quite compelling: technology doomsayers have usually been wrong in the past, there isn&apos;t a concrete threat model, it&apos;s not empirically testable, it&apos;s too extreme, it isn&apos;t well grounded in my experience with existing AI systems, and it&apos;s too far off to do useful work now. All six make me distinctly more skeptical of AI risk.</p><h1><strong>Other progress in AI</strong></h1><h3><strong>Reinforcement learning</strong></h3><p><u><a href=""https://openai.com/blog/procgen-benchmark/"">Procgen Benchmark</a></u> <em>(Karl Cobbe et al)</em> (summarized by Asya): Existing game-based benchmarks for reinforcement learners suffer from the problem that agents constantly encounter near-identical states, meaning that the agents may be overfitting and memorizing specific trajectories rather than learning a general set of skills. In an attempt to remedy this, in this post OpenAI introduces Procgen Benchmark, 16 procedurally-generated video game environments used to measure how quickly a reinforcement learning agent learns generalizable skills.</p><p>The authors conduct several experiments using the benchmark. Notably, they discover that:</p><p>- Agents strongly overfit to small training sets and need access to as many as 10,000 levels to generalize appropriately.</p><p>- After a certain threshold, training performance improves as the training set grows, counter to trends in other supervised learning tasks.</p><p>- Using a fixed series of levels for each training sample (as other benchmarks do) makes agents fail to generalize to randomly generated series of levels at test time.</p><p>- Larger models improve sample efficiency and generalization.</p><p><strong>Asya&apos;s opinion:</strong> This seems like a useful benchmark. I find it particularly interesting that their experiment testing non-procedurally generated levels as training samples implies huge overfitting effects in existing agents trained in video-game environments.</p><p><strong>Read more:</strong> <u><a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01588"">Paper: Leveraging Procedural Generation to Benchmark Reinforcement Learning</a></u></p><p><u><a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01188"">Adaptive Online Planning for Continual Lifelong Learning</a></u> <em>(Kevin Lu et al)</em> (summarized by Nicholas): Lifelong learning is distinct from standard RL benchmarks because</p><p>1. The environment is <em>sequential</em> rather than <em>episodic</em>; it is never reset to a new start state.</p><p>2. The current <em>transition</em> and <em>reward</em> function are given, but they change over time.</p><p>Given this setup, there are two basic approaches: first, run model-free learning on simulated future trajectories and rerun it every time the dynamics change, and second, run model-based planning on the current model. If you ignore computational constraints, these should be equivalent; however, in practice, the second option tends to be more computationally efficient. The contribution of this work is to make this more efficient, rather than improving final performance, by starting with the second option and then using model-free learning to &#x201C;distill&#x201D; the knowledge produced by the model-based planner allowing for more efficient planning in the future.</p><p>Specifically, Adaptive Online Planning (AOP) balances between the model-based planner MPPI (a variant of MPC) and the model-free algorithm TD3. MPPI uses the given model to generate a trajectory up to a horizon and then uses an ensemble of value functions to estimate the cumulative reward. This knowledge is then distilled into TD3 for later use as a prior for MPPI. During future rollouts, the variance and Bellman error of the value function ensemble are used to determine how long the horizon should be, and therefore how much computation is used.</p><p><strong>Nicholas&apos;s opinion:</strong> I agree that episodic training and fixed world dynamics seem like unlikely conditions for most situations we would expect agents to encounter in the real world. Accounting for them seems particularly important to ensure safe exploration and robustness to distributional shift, and I think that these environments could serve as useful benchmarks for these safety problems as well.</p>",rohinmshah,rohinmshah,Rohin Shah,

The hope is to clearly identify one way in which Circling is deeply principled in a way that rhymes with rationality, and potentially explains a substantial fraction of rationalist interest in Circling. As some context; I’m certified to lead Circles in the Circling Europe style after going through their training program, but I’ve done less Circling than Unreal had when she wrote <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/aFyWFwGWBsP5DZbHF/circling""><u>this post</u></a>, and I have minimal experience with the other styles.</p><h2><strong>Why am I interested in Circling?</strong></h2><p>Fundamentally, I think the thing that sets Circling apart is that it focuses on updating based on experience and strives to create a tight, high-bandwidth feedback loop to generate that experience. Add in some other principles and reflection, and you have a functioning culture of empiricism directed at human connection and psychology. I think they’d describe it a bit differently and put the emphasis in different places, while thinking that my characterization isn’t too unfair. This foundation of empiricism makes Circling seem to me like a ‘cousin of Rationality,’ though focused on people instead of systems.&nbsp;</p><p>I first noticed the way in which Circling was trying to implement empiricism early in my Circling experience, but it fully crystallized when a Circler said something that rhymes with P.C. Hodgell’s “That which can be destroyed by the truth should be.” I can’t remember the words precisely, but it was something like “in the practice, I have a deep level of trust that I should be open to the universe.” That is, he didn’t trust that authentic expression will predictably lead to success according to his current goals, but rather that a methodological commitment to putting himself out there and seeing what happens would lead to deeper understanding and connection with others, even though it requires relinquishing attachment to specific goals. This is a cognitive clone of how scientists don’t trust that running experiments will predictably lead to confirmation of their current hypotheses, but rather that a methodological commitment to experimentation and seeing what happens would lead to a deeper understanding of nature. A commitment to natural science is fueled by a belief that the process of openness and updating is worth doing; a commitment to human science is fueled by a belief that the process of openness and updating is worth doing.&nbsp;</p><p>Why should “that which can be destroyed by the truth” be destroyed? Because the <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/X3HpE8tMXz4m4w6Rz/the-simple-truth"">truth</a> is fundamentally more real and valuable than what it replaces, which must be implemented on a deeper level than “what my current beliefs think.” Similarly, why should “that which can be destroyed by authenticity” be destroyed? Because authenticity [IOU: a link as good as 'The Simple Truth'] is fundamentally more real and valuable than what it replaces, which must be implemented on a deeper level than “what my current beliefs think.” I don’t mean to pitch ‘radical honesty’ here, or other sorts of excessive openness; authentic relationships include distance and walls and politeness and flexible preferences.</p><h2><strong>What is Circling, in this view?</strong></h2><p>So what is Circling, and why do I think it’s empirical in this way? I sometimes describe Circling as “multiplayer meditation.” That is, like a meditative practice, it involves a significant chunk of time devoted to attending to your own attention. Unlike sitting meditation, it happens <i>in connection</i> with other people, which allows you to see the parts of your mind that activate around other people, instead of just the parts that activate when you’re sitting with yourself. It also lets you attend to what’s happening in other people, both to get to understand them better and to see the ways in which they are or aren’t a mirror of what’s going on in you. It’s sometimes like ‘the group’ trying to meditate about ‘itself.’ A basic kind of Circle holds one of the members as the ‘object of meditation’, like a mantra or breathing with a sitting meditation, with a different member acting as facilitator, keeping the timebox, opening and closing, and helping guide attention towards the object when it drifts. Other Circles have no predefined object, and go wherever the group’s attention takes them.</p><p>As part of this exploration, people often run into situations where they don’t have social scripts. Circling has its own set of scripts that allow for navigation of trickier territory, and also trains script-writing skills. They often run into situations that are vulnerable, where people are encouraged to follow their attention and name their dilemmas; if you’re trying to deepen your understanding of yourself and become attuned to subtler distinctions between experiences and emotions, running roughshod over your boundaries or switching them off is a clumsy and mistaken way to do so. Circles often find themselves meditating on why they cannot go deeper in that moment, not yet at least, in a way that welcomes and incorporates the resistance.</p><p>Circling Europe has five principles; each of these has a specialized meaning that takes them at least a page to explain, and so my attempt to summarize them in a paragraph will definitely miss out on important nuance. As well, after attempting to explain them normally, I’ll try to view them through the lens of updating and feedback.</p><ol><li>Commitment to Connection: remain in connection with the other despite resistance and impulses to break it, while not forcing yourself to stay when you genuinely want to separate or move away from the other. Reveal yourself to the other, and be willing to fully receive their expression before responding. This generates the high bandwidth information channel that can explore more broadly, while still allowing feedback; if you reveal an intense emotion, I let it land and then share my authentic reaction, allowing you to see what actually happens when you reveal that emotion, and allowing me to see what actually happens when I let that emotion land.</li><li>Owning Experience: Orient towards your impressions and emotions and stories as being <i>yours</i>, instead of about the external world. “I feel alone” instead of “you betrayed me.” It also involves acknowledging difficult emotions, both to yourself and to others. The primary thing this does is avoid battles over “which interpretation is canonical,” replacing that with easier information flow about how different people are experiencing things; it also is a critical part of updating about what’s going on with yourself.</li><li>Trusting Experience: Rather than limiting oneself to emotions and reactions that seem appropriate or justifiable or ‘rational’, be with whatever is actually present in the moment. This gives you a feedback loop of what it’s like to follow your attention, instead of your story of where your attention should be, and lets you update that story. It also helps draw out things that are poorly understood, letting the group discover new territory instead of limiting them to territory that they’ve all been to before. It also allows for all the recursion that normal human attention can access, as well as another layer, of attending to what it’s like to be attending to the Circle when it’s attending to you.</li><li>Staying with the Level of Sensation: An echo of Commitment to Connection, this is about not losing touch with the sensory experience of being in your body (including embodied emotions) while speaking; this keeps things ‘alive’ and maintains the feedback loop between your embodied sense of things and your conscious attention. It has some similarities to <a href=""https://focusing.org/""><u>Gendlin’s</u></a> <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/PXqQhYEdbdAYCp88m/focusing-for-skeptics""><u>Focusing</u></a>. Among other things, it lets you notice when you’re boring yourself.</li><li>Being with the Other in Their World: This one is harder to describe, and has more details than the others, but a short summary is “be curious about the other person, and be open to them working very differently than you think they work; be with them as they reveal themselves, instead of poking at them under a microscope.” This further develops the information channel, in part by helping it feel fair, and in part by allowing for you to be more surprised than you thought you would be.</li></ol><p>Having said all that, I want to note that I might be underselling Commitment to Connection. The story I'm telling here is ""Circling is powered in part by a methodological commitment to openness,"" and noting that science and rationality are powered similarly, but another story you could tell is ""Circling is powered in part by a commitment to connection."" That is, a scientist might say ""yes, it's hard to learn that you're wrong, but it's worth it"" and analogously a Circler might say ""yes, it's hard to look at difficult things, but it's worth it,"" but furthermore a Circler might say ""yes, it's hard to look at difficult things, but we're in this together.""&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Reflection as Secret Sauce</strong></h2><p>It’s one thing to have a feedback loop that builds <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Techne""><u>techne</u></a>, but I think Circling goes further. I think it taps into the power of reflection that creates a <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/46qnWRSR7L2eyNbMA/the-lens-that-sees-its-flaws""><u>Lens That Sees Its Flaws</u></a>. Humans can Circle, and humans can understand Circling; they can Circle about Circling. (They can also write blog posts about Circling, but that one’s a bit harder.) There’s also a benefit to meditating together, as I will have an easier time seeing my blind spots when they’re pointed out to me by other members of a Circle than when I go roaming through my mind by myself. Circling seems to be a way to widen your own lens, and see more of yourself, cultivating those parts to be more deliberate and reflective instead of remaining hidden and unknown.</p></body></html>",Vaniver,vaniver,Vaniver,

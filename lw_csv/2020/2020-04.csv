If we can estimate the likelihood of risks, then we can evaluate their relative importance and apply our risk mitigation resources effectively. Predicting the future is, obviously, far from easy &#x2014; and yet a community of &quot;superforecasters&quot; are attempting to do just that. Not only are they trying, but these superforecasters are also reliably outperforming subject matter experts at making predictions in their own fields. Robert de Neufville joins us on this episode of the FLI Podcast to explain what superforecasting is, how it&apos;s done, and the ways it can help us with crucial decision making.</p><p><strong>Topics discussed in this episode include:</strong></p><p>-What superforecasting is and what the community looks like<br>-How superforecasting is done and its potential use in decision making<br>-The challenges of making predictions<br>-Predictions about and lessons from COVID-19</p><p><strong>You can find the page for this podcast here:</strong> <a href=""https://gate.sc/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffutureoflife.org%2F2020%2F04%2F30%2Fon-superforecasting-with-robert-de-neufville%2F&amp;token=d72290-1-1588287250128"">futureoflife.org/2020/04/30/on-su&#x2026;rt-de-neufville/</a></p><p><strong>You can take a survey about the podcast here: </strong><a href=""https://gate.sc/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.surveymonkey.com%2Fr%2FW8YLYD3&amp;token=97e82d-1-1588287250128"">www.surveymonkey.com/r/W8YLYD3</a></p><p><strong>You can submit a nominee for the Future of Life Award here:</strong> <a href=""https://gate.sc/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffutureoflife.org%2Ffuture-of-life-award-unsung-hero-search%2F&amp;token=a29354-1-1588287250128"">futureoflife.org/future-of-life-a&#x2026;ung-hero-search/</a></p><h1><strong>Transcript</strong></h1><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> Welcome to the Future of Life Institute Podcast. I&#x2019;m Lucas Perry. Today we have a conversation with Robert de Neufville about superforecasting. But, before I get more into the episode I have two items I&#x2019;d like to discuss. The first is that the Future of Life Institute is looking for the 2020 recipient of the Future of Life Award. For those not familiar, the Future of Life Award is a $50,000 prize that we give out to an individual who, without having received much recognition at the time of their actions, has helped to make today dramatically better than it may have been otherwise. The first two recipients were Vasili Arkhipov and Stanislav Petrov, two heroes of the nuclear age. Both took actions at great personal risk to possibly prevent an all-out nuclear war. The third recipient was Dr. Matthew Meselson, who spearheaded the international ban on bioweapons. Right now, we&#x2019;re not sure who to give the 2020 Future of Life Award to. That&#x2019;s where you come in. If you know of an unsung hero who has helped to avoid global catastrophic disaster, or who have done incredible work to ensure a beneficial future of life, please head over to the Future of Life Award page and submit a candidate for consideration. The link for that page is on the page for this podcast or the description of wherever you might be listening. You can also just search for it directly. If your candidate is chosen, you will receive $3,000 as a token of our appreciation. We&#x2019;re also incentivizing the search via MIT&#x2019;s successful red balloon strategy, where the first to nominate the winner gets $3,000 as mentioned, but there are also tiered pay outs to the person who invited the nomination winner, and so on. You can find details about that on the page.&#xA0;</p><p>The second item is that there is a new survey that I wrote about the Future of Life Institute and AI Alignment Podcasts. It&#x2019;s been a year since our last survey and that one was super helpful for me understanding what&#x2019;s going well, what&#x2019;s not, and how to improve. I have some new questions this time around and would love to hear from everyone about possible changes to the introductions, editing, content, and topics covered. So, if you have any feedback, good or bad, you can head over to the SurveyMonkey poll in the description of wherever you might find this podcast or on the page for this podcast. You can answer as many or as little of the questions as you&#x2019;d like and it goes a long way for helping me to gain perspective about the podcast, which is often hard to do from my end because I&#x2019;m so close to it.&#xA0;</p><p>And if you find the content and subject matter of this podcast to be important and beneficial, consider sharing it with friends, subscribing on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or whatever your preferred listening platform, and leaving us a review. It&#x2019;s really helpful for getting information on technological risk and the future of life to more people.</p><p>Regarding today&#x2019;s episode, I just want to provide a little bit of context. The foundation of risk analysis has to do with probabilities. We use these probabilities and the predicted value lost if certain risks occur to calculate or estimate expected value. This in turn helps us to prioritize risk mitigation efforts to where it&#x2019;s truly needed. So, it&#x2019;s important that we&#x2019;re able to make accurate predictions about the likelihood of future events and risk so that we can take the appropriate action to mitigate them. This is where superforecasting comes in.</p><p>Robert de Neufville is a researcher, forecaster, and futurist with degrees in government and political science from Harvard and Berkeley. He works particularly on the risk of catastrophes that might threaten human civilization. He is also a &#x201C;superforecaster&#x201D;, since he was among the top 2% of participants in IARPA&#x2019;s Good Judgment forecasting tournament. He has taught international relations, comparative politics, and political theory at Berkeley and San Francisco State. He has written about politics for The Economist, The New Republic, The Washington Monthly, and Big Think.&#xA0;</p><p>And with that, here&#x2019;s my conversation with Robert de Neufville on superforecasting.&#xA0;</p><p>All right. Robert, thanks so much for coming on the podcast.</p><p><strong>Robert de Neufville:</strong> It&#x2019;s great to be here.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> Let&#x2019;s just start off real simply here. What is superforecasting? Say if you meet someone, a friend or family member of yours asks you what you do for work. How do you explain what superforecasting is?</p><p><strong>Robert de Neufville:</strong> I just say that I do some forecasting. People understand what forecasting is. They may not understand specifically the way I do it. I don&#x2019;t love using &#x201C;superforecasting&#x201D; as a noun. There&#x2019;s the book Superforecasting. It&#x2019;s a good book and it&#x2019;s kind of great branding for Good Judgment, the company, but it&#x2019;s just forecasting, right, and hopefully I&#x2019;m good at it and there are other people that are good at it. We have used different techniques, but it&#x2019;s a little bit like an NBA player saying that they play super basketball. It&#x2019;s still basketball.</p><p>But what I tell people for background is that the US intelligence community had this forecasting competition basically just to see if anyone could meaningfully forecast the future because it turns out one of the things that we&#x2019;ve seen in the past is that people who supposedly have expertise in subjects don&#x2019;t tend to be very good at estimating probabilities that things will happen.</p><p>So the question was, can anyone do that? And it turns out that for the most part people can&#x2019;t, but a small subset of people in the tournament were consistently more accurate than the rest of the people. And just using open source information, we were able to decisively beat subject matter experts who actually that&#x2019;s not a high bar. They don&#x2019;t do very well. And we were also able to beat intelligence community analysts. We didn&#x2019;t originally know we were going up against them, but we&#x2019;re talking about forecasters in the intelligence community who had access to classified information we didn&#x2019;t have access to. We were basically just using Google.</p><p>And one of the stats that we got later was that as a group we were more accurate 300 days ahead of a question being resolved than others were just a hundred days ahead. As far as what makes the technique of superforecasting sort of fundamentally distinct, I think one of the things is that we have a system for scoring our accuracy. A lot of times when people think about forecasting, people just make pronouncements. This thing will happen or it won&#x2019;t happen. And then there&#x2019;s no real great way of checking whether they were right. And they can also often after the fact explain away their forecast. But we make probabilistic predictions and then we use a mathematical formula that weather forecasters have used to score them. And then we can see whether we&#x2019;re doing well or not well. We can evaluate and say, &#x201C;Hey look, we actually outperformed these other people in this way.&#x201D; And we can also then try to improve our forecasting when we don&#x2019;t do well, ask ourselves why and try to improve it. So that&#x2019;s basically how I explain it.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> All right, so can you give me a better understanding here about who &#x201C;we&#x201D; is? You&#x2019;re saying that the key point and where this started was this military competition basically attempting to make predictions about the future or the outcome of certain events. What are the academic and intellectual foundations of superforecasting? What subject areas would one study or did superforecasters come from? How was this all germinated and seeded prior to this competition?</p><p><strong>Robert de Neufville:</strong> It actually was the intelligence community, although though I think military intelligence participated in this. But I mean I didn&#x2019;t study to be a forecaster and I think most of us didn&#x2019;t. I don&#x2019;t know if there really has been a formal study that would lead you to be a forecaster. People just learn subject matter and then apply that in some way. There must be some training that people had gotten in the past, but I don&#x2019;t know about it.</p><p>There was a famous study by Phil Tetlock. I think in the 90s it came out as a book called Expert Political Judgment, and he found essentially that experts were not good at this. But what he did find, he made a distinction between foxes and hedgehogs you might&#x2019;ve heard. Hedgehogs are people that have one way of thinking about things, one system, one ideology, and they apply it to every question, just like the hedgehog has one trick and it&#x2019;s its spines. Hedgehogs didn&#x2019;t do well. If you were a Marxist or equally a dyed in the wool Milton Friedman capitalist and you applied that way of thinking to every problem, you tended not to do as well at forecasting.</p><p>But there&#x2019;s this other group of people that he found did a little bit better and he called him foxes, and foxes are tricky. They have all sorts of different approaches. They don&#x2019;t just come in with some dogmatic ideology. They look at things from a lot of different angles. So that was sort of the initial research that inspired him. And there&#x2019;s other people that were talking about this, but it was ultimately Phil Tetlock and Barb Miller&#x2019;s group that outperformed everyone else, had looked for people that were good at forecasting and they put them together in teams, and they aggregated their scores with algorithmic magic.</p><p>We had a variety of different backgrounds. If you saw any of the press initially, the big story that came out in the press was that we were just regular people. There was a lot of talk about so-and-so was a housewife and that&#x2019;s true. We weren&#x2019;t people that had a reputation for being great pundits or anything. That&#x2019;s totally true. I think that was a little bit overblown though because it made it sound like so and so was a housewife and no one knew that she had this skill. Otherwise she was completely unremarkable. In fact, superforecasters as a group tended to be highly educated with advanced degrees. They tended to have backgrounds and they lived in a bunch of different countries.</p><p>The thing that correlates most with forecasting ability seems to be basically intelligence, performing well on measures of intelligence tests, and also I should say that a lot of very smart people aren&#x2019;t good forecasters. Just being smart isn&#x2019;t enough, but that&#x2019;s one of the strongest predictors of forecasting ability and that&#x2019;s not as good a story for journalists.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> So it wasn&#x2019;t crystals.</p><p><strong>Robert de Neufville:</strong> If you do surveys of the way superforecasters think about the world, they tend not to do what you would call magical thinking. Some of us are religious. I&#x2019;m not. But for the most part the divine isn&#x2019;t an explanation in their forecast. They don&#x2019;t use God to explain it. They don&#x2019;t use things that you might consider a superstition. Maybe that seems obvious, but it&#x2019;s a very rational group.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> How&#x2019;s superforecasting done and what kinds of models are generated and brought to bear?</p><p><strong>Robert de Neufville:</strong> As a group, we tend to be very numeric. That&#x2019;s one thing that correlates pretty well with forecasting ability. And when I say they come from a lot of backgrounds, I mean there are doctors, pharmacists, engineers. I&#x2019;m a political scientist. There are actually a fair number of political scientists. Some people who are in finance or economics, but they all tend to be people who could make at least a simple spreadsheet model. We&#x2019;re not all statisticians, but have at least a intuitive familiarity with statistical thinking and intuitive concept of Bayesian updating.</p><p>As far as what the approach is, we make a lot of simple models, often not very complicated models I think because often when you make a complicated model, you end up over fitting the data and drawing falsely precise conclusions, at least when we&#x2019;re talking about complex, real-world political science-y kind of situations. But I would say the best guide for predicting the future, and this probably sounds obvious, best guide for what&#x2019;s going to happen is what&#x2019;s happened in similar situations in the past. One of the key things you do, if somebody asks you, &#x201C;Will so and so when an election?&#x201D; you would look back and say, &#x201C;Well, what&#x2019;s happened in similar elections in the past? What&#x2019;s the base rate of the incumbent, for example, maybe from this party or that party winning an election, given this economy and so on?&#x201D;</p><p>Now it is often very hard to beat simple algorithms that try to do the same thing, but that&#x2019;s not a thing that you can just do by rote. It requires an element of judgment about what situations in the past count as similar to the situation you&#x2019;re trying to ask a question about. In some ways that&#x2019;s a big part of the trick is to figure out what&#x2019;s relevant to the situation, trying to understand what past events are relevant, and that&#x2019;s something that&#x2019;s hard to teach I think because you could make a case for all sorts of things being relevant and there&#x2019;s an intuitive feel that&#x2019;s hard to explain to someone else.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> The things that seem to be brought to bear here would be like these formal mathematical models and then the other thing would be what I think comes from Daniel Kahneman and is borrowed by the rationalist community, this idea of system one and system two thinking.</p><p><strong>Robert de Neufville:</strong> Right.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> Where system one&#x2019;s, the intuitive, the emotional. We catch balls using system one. System one says the sun will come out tomorrow.</p><p><strong>Robert de Neufville:</strong> Well hopefully the system two does too.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> Yeah. System two does too. So I imagine some questions are just limited to sort of pen and paper system one, system two thinking, and some are questions that are more suitable for mathematical modeling.</p><p><strong>Robert de Neufville:</strong> Yeah, I mean some questions are more suitable for mathematical modeling for sure. I would say though the main system we use is system two. And this is, as you say, we catch balls with some sort of intuitive reflex. It&#x2019;s sort of maybe not in our prefrontal cortex. If I were trying to calculate the trajectory of a ball and tried to catch it, that would work very well. But I think most of what we&#x2019;re doing when we forecast is trying to calculate something else. Often the models are really simple. It might be as simple as saying, &#x201C;This thing has happened seven times in the last 50 years, so let&#x2019;s start from the idea there&#x2019;s a 14% chance of that thing happening again.&#x201D; It&#x2019;s analytical. We don&#x2019;t necessarily just go with the gut and say this feels like a one in three chance.</p><p>Now that said, I think that it helps a lot and this is a problem with applying the results of our work. It helps a lot to have a good intuitive feel of probability like what one in three feels like, just a sense of how often that is. And superforecasters tend to be people who they are able to distinguish between smaller gradations of probability.</p><p>I think in general people that don&#x2019;t think about this stuff very much, they have kind of three probabilities: definitely going to happen, might happen, and will never have. And there&#x2019;s no finer grain distinction there. Whereas, I think superforecasters often feel like they can distinguish between 1% or 2% probabilities, the difference between 50% and 52%.</p><p>The sense of what that means I think is a big thing. If we&#x2019;re going to tell a policymaker there&#x2019;s a 52% chance of something happening, a big part of the problem is that policymakers have no idea what that means. They&#x2019;re like, &#x201C;Well, will it happen or won&#x2019;t it? Oh, what do I do at number?&#x201D; Right? How is that different from 50%? And I</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> All right, so a few things I&#x2019;m interested in here. The first is I&#x2019;m interested in what you have to say about what it means and how one learns how probabilities work. If you were to explain to policymakers or other persons who are interested who are not familiar with working with probabilities a ton, how one can get a better understanding of them and what that looks like. I feel like that would be interesting and helpful. And then the other thing that I&#x2019;m sort of interested in getting a better understanding of is most of what is going on here seems like a lot of system two thinking, but I also would suspect and guess that many of the top superforecasters have very excellent, finely tuned system ones.</p><p><strong>Robert de Neufville:</strong> Yeah.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> Curious if you have any thoughts about these two things.</p><p><strong>Robert de Neufville:</strong> I think that&#x2019;s true. I mean, I don&#x2019;t know exactly what counts as system one in the cognitive psych sense, but I do think that there is a feel that you get. It&#x2019;s like practicing a jump shot or something. I&#x2019;m sure Steph Curry, not that I&#x2019;m Steph Curry in forecasting, but sure, Steph Curry, when he takes a shot, isn&#x2019;t thinking about it at the time. He&#x2019;s just practiced a lot. And by the same token, if you&#x2019;ve done a lot of forecasting and thought about it and have a good feel for it, you may be able to look at something and think, &#x201C;Oh, here&#x2019;s a reasonable forecast. Here&#x2019;s not a reasonable forecast.&#x201D; I had that sense recently. When looking at FiveThirtyEight tracking COVID predictions for a bunch of subject matter experts, and they&#x2019;re honestly kind of doing terribly. And part of it is that some of the probabilities are just not plausible. And that&#x2019;s immediately obvious to me. And I think to other forecasters spent a lot of time thinking about it.</p><p>So I do think that without even having to do a lot of calculations or a lot of analysis, often I have a sense of what&#x2019;s plausible, what&#x2019;s in the right range just because of practice. When I&#x2019;m watching a sporting event and I&#x2019;m stressed about my team winning, for years before I started doing this, I would habitually calculate the probability of winning. It&#x2019;s a neurotic thing. It&#x2019;s like imposing some kind of control. I think I&#x2019;m doing the same thing with COVID, right? I&#x2019;m calculating probabilities all the time to make myself feel more in control. But that actually was pretty good practice for getting a sense of it.</p><p>I don&#x2019;t really have the answer to how to teach that to other people except potentially the practice of trying to forecast and seeing what happens and when you&#x2019;re right and when you&#x2019;re wrong. Good Judgment does have some training materials that improved forecasting for people validated by research. They involve things about thinking about the base rate of things happening in the past and essentially going through sort of system two approaches, and I think that kind of thing can also really help people get a sense for it. But like anything else, there&#x2019;s an element of practice. You can get better or worse at it. Well hopefully you get better.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> So a risk that is 2% likely is two times more likely than a 1% chance risk. How do those feel differently to you than to me or a policymaker who doesn&#x2019;t work with probabilities a ton?</p><p><strong>Robert de Neufville:</strong> Well I don&#x2019;t entirely know. I don&#x2019;t entirely know what they feel like to someone else. I think I do a lot of one time in 50 that&#x2019;s what 2% is and one time in a hundred that&#x2019;s what 1% is. The forecasting platform we use, we only work in integer probabilities. So if it goes below half a percent chance, I&#x2019;d round down to zero. And honestly I think it&#x2019;s tricky to get accurate forecasting with low probability events for a bunch of reasons or even to know if you&#x2019;re doing a good job because you have to do so many of them. I think about fractions often and have a sense of what something happening two times in seven might feel like in a way.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> So you&#x2019;ve made this point here that superforecasters are often better at making predictions than subject matter expertise. Can you unpack this a little bit more and explain how big the difference is? You recently just mentioned the COVID-19 virologists.</p><p><strong>Robert de Neufville:</strong> Virologists, infectious disease experts, I don&#x2019;t know all of them, but people whose expertise I really admire, who know the most about what&#x2019;s going on and to whom I would turn in trying to make a forecast about some of these questions. And it&#x2019;s not really fair because these are people often who have talked to FiveThirtyEight for 10 minutes and produced a forecast. They&#x2019;re very busy doing other things, although some of them are doing modeling and you would think that they would have thought about some of these probabilities in advance. But one thing that really stands out when you look at those is they&#x2019;ll give a 5% or 10% chance of something happening, which to me is virtually impossible. And I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s their better knowledge of virology that makes them think it&#x2019;s more likely. I think it&#x2019;s having thought about what 5% or 10% means a lot. Well, they think it&#x2019;s not very likely and they assign it, which sounds like a low number. That&#x2019;s my guess. I don&#x2019;t really know what they&#x2019;re doing.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> What&#x2019;s an example of that?</p><p><strong>Robert de Neufville:</strong> Recently there were questions about how many tests would be positive by a certain date, and they assigned a real chance, like a 5% or 10%, I don&#x2019;t remember exactly the numbers, but way higher than I thought it would be for there being below a certain number of tests. And the problem with that was it would have meant essentially that all of a sudden the number of tests that were happening positive every day would drop off the cliff. Go from, I don&#x2019;t know how many positive tests are a day, 27,000 in the US all of a sudden that would drop to like 2000 or 3000. And this we&#x2019;re talking about forecasting like a week ahead. So really a short timeline. It just was never plausible to me that all of a sudden tests would stop turning positive. There&#x2019;s no indication that that&#x2019;s about to happen. There&#x2019;s no reason why that would suddenly shift.</p><p>I mean maybe I can always say maybe there&#x2019;s something that a virologist knows that I don&#x2019;t, but I have been reading what they&#x2019;re saying. So how would they think that it would go from 25,000 a day to 2000 a day over the next six days? I&#x2019;m going to assign that basically a 0% chance.</p><p>Another thing that&#x2019;s really striking, and I think this is generally true and it&#x2019;s true to some extent of superforecasts, so we&#x2019;ve had a little bit of an argument on our superforecasting platform, people are terrible at thinking about exponential growth. They really are. They really under predicted the number of cases and deaths even again like a week or two in advance because it was orders of magnitude higher than the number at the beginning of the week. But a computer, they&#x2019;ve had like an algorithm to fit an exponential curve, would have had no problem doing it. Basically, I think that&#x2019;s what the good forecasters did is we fit an exponential curve and said, &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t even need to know many of the details over the course of a week. My outside knowledge is the progression of the disease and vaccines or whatever isn&#x2019;t going to make much difference.&#x201D;</p><p>And like I said it&#x2019;s often hard to beat a simple algorithm, but the virologists and infectious disease experts weren&#x2019;t applying that simple algorithm, and it&#x2019;s fair to say, well maybe some public health intervention will change the curve or something like that. But I think they were assigning way too high a probability to the exponential trends stopping. I just think it&#x2019;s a failure to imagine. You know maybe the Trump administration is motivated reasoning on this score. They kept saying it&#x2019;s fine. There aren&#x2019;t very many deaths yet. But it&#x2019;s easy for someone to project the trajectory a little bit further in the future and say, &#x201C;Wow, there are going to be.&#x201D; So I think that&#x2019;s actually been a major policy issue too is people can&#x2019;t believe the exponential growth.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> There&#x2019;s this tension between not trying to panic everyone in the country or you&#x2019;re unsure if this is the kind of thing that&#x2019;s an exponential or you just don&#x2019;t really intuit how exponentials work. For the longest time, our federal government were like, &#x201C;Oh, it&#x2019;s just a person. There&#x2019;s just like one or two people. They&#x2019;re just going to get better and that will let go away or something.&#x201D; What&#x2019;s your perspective on that? Is that just trying to assuage the populace while they try to figure out what to do or do you think that they actually just don&#x2019;t understand how exponentials work?</p><p><strong>Robert de Neufville:</strong> I&#x2019;m not confident with my theory of mind with people in power. I think one element is this idea that we need to avoid panic and I think that&#x2019;s probably, they believe in good faith, that&#x2019;s a thing that we need to do. I am not necessarily an expert on the role of panic in crises, but I think that that&#x2019;s overblown personally. We have this image of, hey, in the movies, if there&#x2019;s a disaster, all of a sudden everyone&#x2019;s looting and killing each other and stuff, and we think that&#x2019;s what&#x2019;s going to happen. But actually often in disasters people really pull together and if anything have a stronger sense of community and help their neighbors rather than immediately go and try to steal their supplies. We did see some people fighting over toilet paper on news rolls and there are always people like that, but even this idea that people were hoarding toilet paper, I don&#x2019;t even think that&#x2019;s the explanation for why it was out of the stores.</p><p>If you tell everyone in the country they need two to three weeks and toilet paper right now today, yeah, of course they&#x2019;re going to buy it off the shelf. That&#x2019;s actually just what they need to buy. I haven&#x2019;t seen a lot of panic. And I honestly am someone, if I had been an advisor to the administrations, I would have said something along the lines of &#x201C;It&#x2019;s better to give people accurate information so we can face it squarely than to try to sugarcoat it.&#x201D;</p><p>But I also think that there was a hope that if we pretended things weren&#x2019;t about to happen or that maybe they would just go away, I think that that was misguided. There seems to be some idea that you could reopen the economy and people would just die but the economy would end up being fine. I don&#x2019;t think that would be worth it any way. Even if you don&#x2019;t shut down, the economy&#x2019;s going to be disrupted by what&#x2019;s happening. So I think there are a bunch of different motivations for why governments weren&#x2019;t honest or weren&#x2019;t dealing squarely with this. It&#x2019;s hard to know what&#x2019;s not honesty and what is just genuine confusion.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> So what organizations exist that are focused on superforecasting? Where or what are the community hubs and prediction aggregation mechanisms for superforecasters?</p><p><strong>Robert de Neufville:</strong> So originally in the IARPA Forecasting Tournament, there were a bunch of different competing teams, and one of them was run by a group called Good Judgment. And that team ended up doing so well. They ended up basically taking over the later years of the tournament and it became the Good Judgment project. There was then a spinoff. Phil Tetlock and others who were involved with that spun off into something called Good Judgment Incorporated. That is the group that I work with and a lot of the superforecasters that were identified in that original tournament continue to work with Good Judgment.</p><p>We do some public forecasting and I try to find private clients interested in our forecasts. It&#x2019;s really a side gig for me and part of the reason I do it is that it&#x2019;s really interesting. It gives me an opportunity to think about things in a way and I feel like I&#x2019;m much better up on certain issues because I&#x2019;ve thought about them as forecasting questions. So there&#x2019;s Good Judgment Inc. and they also have something called the Good Judgment Open. They have an open platform where you can forecast the kinds of questions we do. I should say that we have a forecasting platform. They come up with forecastable questions, but forecastable means that they&#x2019;re a relatively clear resolution criteria.</p><p>But also you would be interested in knowing the answer. It wouldn&#x2019;t be just some picky trivial answer. They&#x2019;ll have a set resolution date so you know that if you&#x2019;re forecasting something happening, it has to happen by a certain date. So it&#x2019;s all very well-defined. And coming up with those questions is a little bit of its own skill. It&#x2019;s pretty hard to do. So Good Judgment will do that. And they put it on a platform where then as a group we discuss the questions and give our probability estimates.</p><p>We operate to some extent in teams and they found there&#x2019;s some evidence that teams of forecasters, at least good forecasters, can do a little bit better than people on their own. I find it very valuable because other forecasters do a lot of research and they critique my own ideas. There&#x2019;s concerns about group think, but I think that we&#x2019;re able to avoid those. I can talk about why if you want. Then there&#x2019;s also this public platform called Good Judgment Open where they use the same kind of questions and anyone can participate. And they&#x2019;ve actually identified some new superforecasters who participated on this public platform, people who did exceptionally well, and then they invited them to work with the company as well. There are others. I know a couple of superforecasters who are spinning off their own group. They made an app. I think it&#x2019;s called Maybe, where you can do your own forecasting and maybe come up with your own questions. And that&#x2019;s a neat app. There is Metaculus, which certainly tries to apply the same principles. And I know some superforecasters who forecast on Metaculus. I&#x2019;ve looked at it a little bit, but I just haven&#x2019;t had time because forecasting takes a fair amount of time. And then there are always prediction markets and things like that. There are a number of other things, I think, that try to apply the same principles. I don&#x2019;t know enough about the space to know of all of the other platforms and markets that exist.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> For some more information on the actual act of forecasting that will be put onto these websites, can you take us through something which you have forecasted recently that ended up being true? And tell us how much time it took you to think about it? And what your actual thinking was on it? And how many variables and things you considered?</p><p><strong>Robert de Neufville:</strong> Yeah, I mean it varies widely. And to some extent it varies widely on the basis of how many times have I forecasted something similar. So sometimes we&#x2019;ll forecast the change in interest rates, the fed moves. That&#x2019;s something that&#x2019;s obviously a lot of interest to people in finance. And at this point, I&#x2019;ve looked at that kind of thing enough times that I have set ideas about what would make that likely or not likely to happen.</p><p>But some questions are much harder. We&#x2019;ve had questions about mortality in certain age groups in different districts in England and I didn&#x2019;t know anything about that. And all sorts of things come into play. Is the flu season likely to be bad? What&#x2019;s the chance of flu season will be bad? Is there a general trend among people who are dying of complications from diabetes? Does poverty matter? How much would Brexit affect mortality chances? Although a lot of what I did was just look at past data and project trends, just basically projecting trends you can get a long way towards an accurate forecast in a lot of circumstances.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> When such a forecast is made and added to these websites and the question for the thing which is being predicted resolves, what are the ways in which the websites aggregate these predictions? Or are we at the stage of them often being put to use? Or is the utility of these websites currently primarily honing the epistemic acuity of the forecasters?</p><p><strong>Robert de Neufville:</strong> There are a couple of things. Like I hope that my own personal forecasts are potentially pretty accurate. But when we work together on a platform, we will essentially produce an aggregate, which is, roughly speaking, the median prediction. There&#x2019;s some proprietary elements to it. They extremize it a little bit, I think, because once you aggregate it kind of blurs things towards the middle. They maybe weight certain forecasts and more recent forecasts differently. I don&#x2019;t know the details of it. But you can improve accuracy not just by taking the median of our forecast or in a prediction market, but doing a little algorithmic tweaking they found they can improve accuracy a little bit. That&#x2019;s sort of what happens with our output.</p><p>And then as far as how people use it, I&#x2019;m afraid not very well. There are people who are interested in Good Judgement&#x2019;s forecasts and who pay them to produce forecasts. But it&#x2019;s not clear to me what decision makers do with it or if they know what to do.</p><p>I think a big problem selling forecasting is that people don&#x2019;t know what to do with a 78% chance of this, or let&#x2019;s say a 2% chance of a pandemic in a given year, I&#x2019;m just making that up. But somewhere in that ballpark, what does that mean about how you should prepare? I think that people don&#x2019;t know how to work with that. So it&#x2019;s not clear to me that our forecasts are necessarily affecting policy. Although it&#x2019;s the kind of thing that gets written up in the news and who knows how much that affects people&#x2019;s opinions, or they talk about it at Davos and maybe those people go back and they change what they&#x2019;re doing.</p><p>Certain areas, I think people in finance know how to work with probabilities a little bit better. But they also have models that are fairly good at projecting certain types of things, so they&#x2019;re already doing a reasonable job, I think.</p><p>I wish it were used better. If I were the advisor to a president, I would say you should create a predictive intelligence unit using superforecasters. Maybe give them access to some classified information, but even using open source information, have them predict probabilities of certain kinds of things and then develop a system for using that in your decision making. But I think we&#x2019;re a fair ways away from that. I don&#x2019;t know any interest in that in the current administration.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> One obvious leverage point for that would be if you really trusted this group of superforecasters. And the key point for that is just simply how accurate they are. So just generally, how accurate is superforecasting currently? If we took the top 100 superforecasters in the world, how accurate are they over history?</p><p><strong>Robert de Neufville:</strong> We do keep score, right? But it depends a lot on the difficulty of the question that you&#x2019;re asking. If you ask me whether the sun will come up tomorrow, yeah, I&#x2019;m very accurate. If you asked me to predict a random number generator, but you want a 100, I&#x2019;m not very accurate. And it&#x2019;s hard often to know with a given question how hard it is to forecast.</p><p>I have what&#x2019;s called a Brier score. Essentially a mathematical way of correlating your forecast, the probabilities you give with the outcomes. A lower Brier score essentially is a better fit. I can tell you what my Brier score was on the questions I forecasted in the last year. And I can tell you that it&#x2019;s better than a lot of other people&#x2019;s Brier scores. And that&#x2019;s the way you know I&#x2019;m doing a good job. But it&#x2019;s hard to say how accurate that is in some absolute sense.</p><p>It&#x2019;s like saying how good are NBA players and taking jump shots. It depends where they&#x2019;re shooting from. That said, I think broadly speaking, we are the most accurate. So far, superforecasters had a number of challenges. And I mean I&#x2019;m proud of this. We pretty much crushed all comers. They&#x2019;ve tried to bring artificial intelligence into it. We&#x2019;re still, I think as far as I know, the gold standard of forecasting. But we&#x2019;re not prophets by any means. Accuracy for us is saying there&#x2019;s a 15% chance of this thing in politics happening. And then when we do that over a bunch of things, yeah, 15% of them end up happening. It is not saying this specific scenario will definitely come to pass. We&#x2019;re not prophets. Getting the well calibrated probabilities over a large number of forecasts is the best that we can do, I think, right now and probably in the near future for these complex political social questions.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> Would it be skillful to have some sort of standardized group of expert forecasters rank the difficulty of questions, which then you would be able to better evaluate and construct a Brier score for persons?</p><p><strong>Robert de Neufville:</strong> It&#x2019;s an interesting question. I think I could probably tell you, I&#x2019;m sure other forecasters could tell you which questions are relatively easier or harder to predict. Things where there&#x2019;s a clear trend and there&#x2019;s no good reason for it changing are relatively easy to predict. Things where small differences could make it tip into a lot of different end states are hard to predict. And I can sort of have a sense initially what those would be.</p><p>I don&#x2019;t know what the advantage of ranking questions like that and then trying to do some weighted adjustment. I mean maybe you could. But the best way that I know of to really evaluate forecasting scale is to compare it with other forecasters. I&#x2019;d say it&#x2019;s kind of a baseline. What do you know other good forecasters come up with and what do average forecasters come up with? And can you beat prediction markets? I think that&#x2019;s the best way of evaluating relative forecasting ability. But I&#x2019;m not sure it&#x2019;s possible that some kind of weighting would be useful in some context. I hadn&#x2019;t really thought about it.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> All right, so you work both as a superforecaster, as we&#x2019;ve been talking about, but you also have a position at the Global Catastrophic Risk Institute. Can you provide a little bit of explanation for how superforecasting and existential and global catastrophic risk analysis are complimentary?</p><p><strong>Robert de Neufville:</strong> What we produce at GCRI, a big part of our product is academic research. And there are a lot of differences. If I say there&#x2019;s a 10% chance of something happening on a forecasting platform, I have an argument for that. I can try to convince you that my rationale is good. But it&#x2019;s not the kind of argument that you would make in an academic paper. It wouldn&#x2019;t convince people it was 100% right. My warrant for saying that on the forecasting platform is I have a track record. I&#x2019;m good at figuring out what the correct argument is or have been in the past, but producing an academic paper is a whole different thing.</p><p>There&#x2019;s some of the same skills, but we&#x2019;re trying to produce a somewhat different output. What superforecasters say is an input in writing papers about catastrophic risk or existential risk. We&#x2019;ll use what superforecasters think as a piece of data. That said, superforecasters are validated at doing well at certain category of political, social economic questions. And over a certain timeline, we know that we outperform others up to like maybe two years.</p><p>We don&#x2019;t really know if we can do meaningful forecasting 10 years out. That hasn&#x2019;t been validated. You can see why that would be difficult to do. You would have to have a long experiment to even figure that out. And it&#x2019;s often hard to figure out what the right questions to ask about 2030 would be. I generally think that the same techniques we use would be useful for forecasting 10 years out, but we don&#x2019;t even know that. And so a lot of the things that I would look at in terms of global catastrophic risk would be things that might happen at some distant point in the future. Now what&#x2019;s the risk that there will be a nuclear war in 2020, but also over the next 50 years? It&#x2019;s a somewhat different thing to do.</p><p>They&#x2019;re complementary. They both involve some estimation of risk and they use some of the same techniques. But the longer term aspect &#x2026; The fact that as I think I said, one of the best ways superforecasters do well is that they use the past as a guide to the future. A good rule of thumb is that the status quo is likely to be the same. There&#x2019;s a certain inertia. Things are likely to be similar in a lot of ways to the past. I don&#x2019;t know if that&#x2019;s necessarily very useful for predicting rare and unprecedented events. There is no precedent for an artificial intelligence catastrophe, so what&#x2019;s the base rate of that happening? It&#x2019;s never happened. I can use some of the same techniques, but it&#x2019;s a little bit of a different kind of thing.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> Two people are coming to my mind of late. One is Ray Kurzweil, who has made a lot of longterm technological predictions about things that have not happened in the past. And then also curious to know if you&#x2019;ve read The Precipice: Existential Risk and the Future of Humanity by Toby Ord. Toby makes specific predictions about the likelihood of existential and global catastrophic risks in that book. I&#x2019;m curious if you have any perspective or opinion or anything to add on either of these two predictors or their predictions?</p><p><strong>Robert de Neufville:</strong> Yeah, I&#x2019;ve read some good papers by Toby Ord. I haven&#x2019;t had a chance to read the book yet, so I can&#x2019;t really comment on that. I really appreciate Ray Kurzweil. And one of the things he does that I like is that he holds himself accountable. He&#x2019;s looked back and said, how accurate are my predictions? Did this come true or did that not come true? I think that is a basic hygiene point of forecasting. You have to hold yourself accountable and you can&#x2019;t just go back and say, &#x201C;Look, I was right,&#x201D; and not rationalize whatever somewhat off forecasts you&#x2019;ve made.</p><p>That said, when I read Kurzweil, I&#x2019;m skeptical, maybe that&#x2019;s my own inability to handle exponential change. When I look at his predictions for certain years, I think he does a different set of predictions for seven year periods. I thought, &#x201C;Well, he&#x2019;s actually seven years ahead.&#x201D; That&#x2019;s pretty good actually, if you&#x2019;re predicting what things are going to be like in 2020, but you just think it&#x2019;s going to be 2013. Maybe they get some credit for that. But I think that he is too aggressive and optimistic about the pace of change. Obviously exponential change can happen quickly.</p><p>But I also think another rule of thumb is that things take a long time to go through beta. There&#x2019;s the planning fallacy. People always think that projects are going to take less time than they actually do. And even when you try to compensate for the planning fallacy and double the amount of time, it still takes twice as much time as you come up with. I tend to think Kurzweil sees things happening sooner than they will. He&#x2019;s a little bit of a techno optimist, obviously. But I haven&#x2019;t gone back and looked at all of his self evaluation. He scores himself pretty well.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> So we&#x2019;ve spoken a bit about the different websites. And what are they technically called, what is the difference between a prediction market and &#x2026; I think Metaculus calls itself a massive online prediction solicitation and aggregation engine, which is not a prediction market. What are the differences here and how&#x2019;s the language around these platforms used?</p><p><strong>Robert de Neufville:</strong> Yeah, so I don&#x2019;t necessarily know all the different distinction categories someone would make. I think a prediction market particularly is where you have some set of funds, some kind of real or fantasy money. We used one market in the Good Judgement project. Our money was called Inkles and we could spend that money. And essentially, they traded probabilities like you would trade a share. So if there was a 30% chance of something happening on the market, that&#x2019;s like a price of 30 cents. And you would buy that for 30 cents and then if people&#x2019;s opinions about how likely that was changed and a lot of people bought it, then we could bid up to 50% chance of happening and that would be worth 50 cents.</p><p>So if I correctly realize that something &#x2026; that the market says is a 30% chance of happening, if I correctly realized that, that&#x2019;s more likely, I would buy shares of that. And then eventually either other people would realize it, too, or it would happen. I should say that when things happened, then you&#x2019;d get a dollar, then it&#x2019;s suddenly it&#x2019;s 100% chance of happening.</p><p>So if you recognize that something had a higher percent chance of happening than the market was valuing at, you could buy a share of that and then you would make money. That basically functions like a stock market, except literally what you&#x2019;re trading is directly the probability of a question will answer yes or no.</p><p>The stock market&#x2019;s supposed to be really efficient, and I think in some ways it is. I think prediction markets are somewhat useful. Big problem with prediction markets is that they&#x2019;re not liquid enough, which is to say that a stock market, there&#x2019;s so much money going around and people are really just on it to make money, that it&#x2019;s hard to manipulate the prices.</p><p>There&#x2019;s plenty of liquidity on the prediction markets that I&#x2019;ve been a part of. Like for the one on the Good Judgement project, for example, sometimes there&#x2019;d be something that would say there was like a 95% chance of it happening on the prediction market. In fact, there would be like a 99.9% chance of it happening. But I wouldn&#x2019;t buy that share, even though I knew it was undervalued, because the return on investment wasn&#x2019;t as high as it was on some other questions. So it would languish at this inaccurate probability, because there just wasn&#x2019;t enough money to chase all the good investments.</p><p>So that&#x2019;s one problem you can have in a prediction market. Another problem you can have &#x2026; I see it happen with PredictIt, I think. They used to be the IO Exchange predicting market. People would try to manipulate the market for some advertising reason, basically.</p><p>Say you were working on a candidate&#x2019;s campaign and you wanted to make it look like they were a serious contender, it was a cheap investment and you put a lot of money in the prediction market and you boost their chances, but that&#x2019;s not really boosting their chances. That&#x2019;s just market manipulation. You can&#x2019;t really do that with the whole stock market, but prediction markets aren&#x2019;t well capitalized, you can do that.</p><p>And then I really enjoy PredictIt. PredictIt&#x2019;s one of the prediction markets that exists for political questions. They have some dispensation so that it doesn&#x2019;t count as gambling in the U.S. Add it&#x2019;s research purposes: is there some research involved with PredictIt. But they have a lot of fees and they use their fees to pay for the people who run the market. And it&#x2019;s expensive. But the fees mean that the prices are very sticky and it&#x2019;s actually pretty hard to make money. Probabilities have to be really out of whack before you can make enough money to cover your fees.</p><p>So things like that make these markets not as accurate. I also think that although we&#x2019;ve all heard about the wisdom of the crowds, and broadly speaking, crowds might do better than just a random person. They can also do a lot of herding behavior that good forecasters wouldn&#x2019;t do. And sometimes the crowds overreact to things. And I don&#x2019;t always think the probabilities that prediction markets come up with are very good.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> All right. Moving along here a bit. Continuing the relationship of superforecasting with global catastrophic and existential risk. How narrowly do you think that we can reduce the error range for superforecasts on low probability events like global catastrophic risks and existential risks? If a group of forecasters settled on a point estimate of 2% chance for some kind of global catastrophic for existential risk, but with an error range of like 1%, that dramatically changes how useful the prediction is, because of its major effects on risk. How accurate do you think we can get and how much do you think we can squish the probability range?</p><p><strong>Robert de Neufville:</strong> That&#x2019;s a really hard question. When we produce forecasts, I don&#x2019;t think there&#x2019;s necessarily clear error bars built in. One thing that Good Judgement will do, is it will show where forecasters all agreed the probability is 2% and then it will show if there&#x2019;s actually a wide variation. I&#x2019;m thinking 0%, some think it&#x2019;s 4% or something like that. And that maybe tells you something. And if we had a lot of very similar forecasts, maybe you could look back and say, we tend to have an error of this much. But for the kinds of questions we look at with catastrophic risk, it might really be hard to have a large enough &#x201C;n&#x201D;. Hopefully it&#x2019;s hard to have a large &#x201C;n&#x201D; where you could really compute an error range. If our aggregate spits out a probability of 2%, it&#x2019;s difficult to know in advance for a somewhat unique question how far off we could be.</p><p>I don&#x2019;t spend a lot of time thinking about frequentist or Bayesian interpretations or probability or counterfactuals or whatever. But at some point, if I say it has a 2% probability of something and then it happens, I mean it&#x2019;s hard to know what my probability meant. Maybe we live in a deterministic universe and that was 100% going to happen and I simply failed to see the signs of it. I think that to some extent, what kind of probabilities you assign things depend on the amount of information you get.</p><p>Often we might say that was a reasonable probability to assign to something because we couldn&#x2019;t get much better information. Given the information we had, that was our best estimate of the probability. But it might always be possible to know with more confidence if we got better information. So I guess one thing I would say is if you want to reduce the error on our forecasts, it would help to have better information about the world.</p><p>And that&#x2019;s some extent where what I do with GCRI comes in. We&#x2019;re trying to figure out how to produce better estimates. And that requires research. It requires thinking about these problems in a systematic way to try to decompose them into different parts and figure out what we can look at the past and use to inform our probabilities. You can always get better information and produce more accurate probabilities, I think.</p><p>The best thing to do would be to think about these issues more carefully. Obviously, it&#x2019;s a field. Catastrophic risk is something that people study, but it&#x2019;s not the most mainstream field. There&#x2019;s a lot of research that needs to be done. There&#x2019;s a lot of low hanging fruit, work that could easily be done applying research done in other fields, to catastrophic risk issues. But they&#x2019;re just aren&#x2019;t enough researchers and there isn&#x2019;t enough funding to do all the work that we should do.</p><p>So my answer would be, we need to do better research. We need to study these questions more closely. That&#x2019;s how we get to better probability estimates.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> So if we have something like a global catastrophic or existential risk, and say a forecaster says that there&#x2019;s a less than 1% chance that, that thing is likely to occur. And if this less than 1% likely thing happens in the world, how does that update our thinking about what the actual likelihood of that risk was? Given this more meta point that you glossed over about how if the universe is deterministic, then the probability of that thing was actually more like 100%. And the information existed somewhere, we just didn&#x2019;t have access to that information or something. Can you add a little bit of commentary here about what these risks mean?</p><p><strong>Robert de Neufville:</strong> I guess I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s that important when forecasting, if I have a strong opinion about whether or not we live in a single deterministic universe where outcomes are in some sense in the future, all sort of baked in. And if only we could know everything, then we would know with a 100% chance everything that was going to happen. Or whether there are some fundamental randomness, or maybe we live in a multiverse where all these different outcomes are happening, you could say that in 30% of the universes in this multiverse, this outcome comes true. I don&#x2019;t think that really matters for the most part. I do think as a practical question, we may make forecast on the basis of the best information we have, that&#x2019;s all you can do. But there are some times you look back and say, &#x201C;Well, I missed this. I should&#x2019;ve seen this thing.&#x201D; I didn&#x2019;t think that Donald Trump would win the 2016 election. That&#x2019;s literally my worst Brier score ever. I&#x2019;m not alone in that. And I comfort myself by saying there was actually genuinely small differences made a huge impact.</p><p>But there are other forecasters who saw it better than I did. Nate Silver didn&#x2019;t think that Trump was a lock, but he thought it was more likely and he thought it was more likely for the right reasons. That you would get this correlated polling error in a certain set of states that would hand Trump the electoral college. So in retrospect, I think, in that case I should&#x2019;ve seen something like what Nate Silver did. Now I don&#x2019;t think in practice it&#x2019;s possible to know enough about an election to get in advance who&#x2019;s going to win.</p><p>I think we still have to use the tools that we have, which are things like polling. In complex situations, there&#x2019;s always stuff that I missed when I make a mistake and I can look back and say I should have done a better job figuring that stuff out. I do think though, with the kinds of questions we forecast, there&#x2019;s a certain irreducible, I don&#x2019;t want to say randomness because I&#x2019;m not making a position on whether the university is deterministic, but irreducible uncertainty about what we&#x2019;re realistically able to know and we have to base our forecasts on the information that&#x2019;s possible to get. I don&#x2019;t think metaphysical interpretation is that important to figuring out these questions. Maybe it comes up a little bit more with unprecedented one-off events. Even then I think you&#x2019;re still trying to use the same information to estimate probabilities.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> Yeah, that makes sense. There&#x2019;s only the set of information that you have access to.</p><p><strong>Robert de Neufville:</strong> Something actually occurs to me. One of the things that superforecaster are proud of is that we beat these intelligence analysts that had access to classified information and I think that if we had access to more information, I mean we&#x2019;re doing our research on Google, right? Or maybe occasionally we&#x2019;ll write a government official and get a FOIA request or something, but we&#x2019;re using open source intelligence and it, I think it would probably help if we had access to more information that would inform our forecasts, but sometimes more information actually hurts you.</p><p>People have talked about a classified information bias that if you have secret information that other people don&#x2019;t have, you are likely to think that is more valuable and useful than it actually is and you overweight the classified information. But if you had that secret information, I don&#x2019;t know if it&#x2019;s an ego thing, you want to have a different forecast than other people don&#x2019;t have access to. It makes you special. You have to be a little bit careful. More information isn&#x2019;t always better. Sometimes the easy to find information is actually really dispositive and is enough. And if you search for more information, you can find stuff that is irrelevant to your forecast, but think that it is relevant.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> So if there&#x2019;s some sort of risk and the risk occurs, after the fact how does one update what the probability was more like?</p><p><strong>Robert de Neufville:</strong> It depends a little bit of the context. If you want to evaluate my prediction. If I say I thought there was a 30% chance of the original Brexit vote would be to leave England. That actually was more accurate than some other people, but I didn&#x2019;t think it was likely. Now in hindsight, should I have said 100%. Somebody might argue that I should have, that if you&#x2019;d really been paying attention, you would have known 100%.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> But like how do we know it wasn&#x2019;t 5% and we live in a rare world?</p><p><strong>Robert de Neufville:</strong> We don&#x2019;t. You basically can infer almost nothing from an n of 1. Like if I say there&#x2019;s a 1% chance of something happening and it happens, you can be suspicious that I don&#x2019;t know what I&#x2019;m talking about. Even from that n of 1, but there&#x2019;s also a chance that there was a 1% chance that it happened and that was the 1 time in a 100. To some extent that could be my defense of my prediction that Hillary was going to win. I should talk about my failures. The night before, I thought there was a 97% chance that Hillary would win the election and that&#x2019;s terrible. And I think that that was a bad forecast in hindsight. But I will say that typically when I&#x2019;ve said there&#x2019;s a 97% chance of something happening, they have happened.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve made more than 30-some predictions that things are going to be 97% percent likely and that&#x2019;s the only one that&#x2019;s been wrong. So maybe I&#x2019;m actually well calibrated. Maybe that was the 3% thing that happened. You can only really judge over a body of predictions and if somebody is always saying there&#x2019;s a 1% chance of things happening and they always happen, then that&#x2019;s not a good forecaster. But that&#x2019;s a little bit of a problem when you&#x2019;re looking at really rare, unprecedented events. It&#x2019;s hard to know how well someone does at that because you don&#x2019;t have an n of hopefully more than 1. It is difficult to assess those things.</p><p>Now we&#x2019;re in the middle of a pandemic and I think that the fact that this pandemic happened maybe should update our beliefs about how likely pandemics will be in the future. There was the Spanish flu and the Asian flu and this. And so now we have a little bit more information about the base rate, which these things happen. It&#x2019;s a little bit difficult because 1918 is very different from 2020. The background rate of risk, may be very different from what it was in 1918 so you want to try to take those factors into account, but each event does give us some information that we can use for estimating the risk in the future. You can do other things. A lot of what we do as a good forecaster is inductive, right? But you can use deductive reasoning. You can, for example, with rare risks, decompose them into the steps that would have to happen for them to happen.</p><p>What systems have to fail for a nuclear war to start? Or what are the steps along the way to potentially an artificial intelligence catastrophe. And I might be able to estimate the probability of some of those steps more accurately than I estimate the whole thing. So that gives us some kind of analytic methods to estimate probabilities even without real base rate of the thing itself happening.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> So related to actual policy work and doing things in the world. The thing that becomes skillful here seems to be to use these probabilities to do expected value calculations to try and estimate how much resources should be fed into mitigating certain kinds of risks.</p><p><strong>Robert de Neufville:</strong> Yeah.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> The probability of the thing happening requires a kind of forecasting and then also the value that is lost requires another kind of forecasting. What are your perspectives or opinions on superforecasting and expected value calculations and their use in decision making and hopefully someday more substantially in government decision making around risk?</p><p><strong>Robert de Neufville:</strong> We were talking earlier about the inability of policymakers to understand probabilities. I think one issue is that a lot of times when people make decisions, they want to just say, &#x201C;What&#x2019;s going to happen? I&#x2019;m going to plan for the single thing that&#x2019;s going to happen.&#x201D; But as a forecaster, I don&#x2019;t know what&#x2019;s going to happen. I might if I&#x2019;m doing a good job, know there&#x2019;s a certain percent chance that this will happen, a certain percent chance that that will happen. And in general, I think that policymakers need to make decisions over sort of the space of possible outcomes with the planning for contingencies. And I think that is a more complicated exercise than a lot of policymakers want to do. I mean I think it does happen, but it requires being able to hold in your mind all these contingencies and plan for them simultaneously. And I think that with expected value calculations to some extent, that&#x2019;s what you have to do.</p><p>That gets very complicated very quickly. When we forecast questions, we might forecast some discrete fact about the world and how many COVID deaths will there be by a certain date. And it&#x2019;s neat that I&#x2019;m good at that, but there&#x2019;s a lot that that doesn&#x2019;t tell you about the state of the world at that time. There&#x2019;s a lot of information that would be valuable making decisions. I don&#x2019;t want to say infinite because it may be sort of technically wrong, but there is essentially uncountable amount of things you might want to know and you might not even know what the relevant questions to ask about a certain space. So it&#x2019;s always going to be somewhat difficult to get an expected value calculation because you can sort of not possibly forecast all the things that might determine the value of something.</p><p>I mean, this is a little bit of a philosophical critique of consequentialist kind of analyses of things too. Like if you ask if something is good or bad, it may have an endless chain of consequences rippling throughout future history and maybe it&#x2019;s really a disaster now, but maybe it means that future Hitler isn&#x2019;t born. How do you evaluate that? It might seem like a silly trivial point, but the fact is it may be really difficult to know enough about the consequences of your action to an expected value calculation. So your expected value calculation may have to be kind of a approximation in a certain sense, given broad things we know these are things that are likely to happen. I still think expected value calculations are good. I just think there&#x2019;s a lot of uncertainty in them and to some extent it&#x2019;s probably irreducible. I think it&#x2019;s always better to think about things clearly if you can. It&#x2019;s not the only approach. You have to get buy-in from people and that makes a difference. But the more you can do accurate analysis about things, I think the better your decisions are likely to be.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> How much faith or confidence do you have that the benefits of superforecasting and this kind of thought will increasingly be applied to critical government or non-governmental decision-making processes around risk?</p><p><strong>Robert de Neufville:</strong> Not as much as I&#x2019;d like. I think now that we know that people can do a better or worse job of predicting the future, we can use that information and it will eventually begin to be integrated into our governance. I think that that will help. But in general, you know my background&#x2019;s in political science and political science is, I want to say, kind of discouraging. You learn that even under the best circumstances, outcomes of political struggles over decisions are not optimal. And you could imagine some kind of technocratic decision-making system, but even that ends up having its problems or the technocrats end up just lining their own pockets without even realizing they&#x2019;re doing it or something. So I&#x2019;m a little bit skeptical about it and right now what we&#x2019;re seeing with the pandemic, I think we systematically underprepare for certain kinds of things, that there are reasons why it doesn&#x2019;t help leaders very much to prepare for things that will never happen.</p><p>And with something like a public health crisis, the deliverable is for nothing to happen and if you succeed, it looks like all your money was wasted, but in fact you&#x2019;ve actually prevented anything from happening and that&#x2019;s great. The problem is that that creates an underincentive for leaders. They don&#x2019;t get credit for preventing the pandemic that no one even knew could have happened and they don&#x2019;t necessarily win the next election or business leaders may not improve their quarterly profits much by preparing for rare risks for that and other reasons too. I think that we&#x2019;re probably&#x2026; have a hard time believing cognitively that certain kinds of things that seem crazy like this could happen. I&#x2019;m somewhat skeptical about that. Now I think in this case we had institutions who did prepare for this, but for whatever reason a lot of governments fail to do what was necessary.</p><p>Failed to respond quickly enough or minimize that what was happening. There are worse actors than others, right, but this isn&#x2019;t a problem that&#x2019;s just about the US government. This is a problem in Italy, in China, and it&#x2019;s disheartening because COVID-19 is pretty much exactly one of the major scenarios that infectious disease experts have been warning about. The novel coronavirus that jumps from animals to humans that spread through some kind of respiratory pathway that&#x2019;s highly infectious, that spreads asymptomatically. This is something that people worried about and knew about and in a sense it was probably only a matter of time that this was going to happen and there might be a small risk in any given year and yet we weren&#x2019;t ready for it, didn&#x2019;t take the steps, we lost time. It could have been used saving lives. That&#x2019;s really disheartening.</p><p>I would like to see us learn a lesson from this and I think to some extent, once this is all over, whenever that is, we will probably create some institutional structures, but then we have to maintain them. We tend to forget a generation later about these kinds of things. We need to create governance systems that have more incentive to prepare for rare risks. It&#x2019;s not the only thing we should be doing necessarily, but we are underprepared. That&#x2019;s my view.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> Yeah, and I mean the sample size of historic pandemics is quite good, right?</p><p><strong>Robert de Neufville:</strong> Yeah. It&#x2019;s not like we were invaded by aliens. Something like this happens in just about every person&#x2019;s lifetime. It&#x2019;s historically not that rare and this is a really bad one, but the Spanish flu and the Asian flu were also pretty bad. We should have known this was coming.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> What I&#x2019;m also reminded here of and some of these biases you&#x2019;re talking about, we have climate change on the other hand, which is destabilizing and kind of global catastrophic risky, depending on your definition and for people who are against climate change, there seems to be A) lack in trust of science and B) then not wanting to invest in expensive technologies or something that seemed wasteful. I&#x2019;m just reflecting here on all of the biases that fed into our inability to prepare for COVID.</p><p><strong>Robert de Neufville:</strong> Well, I don&#x2019;t think the distrust of science is sort of a thing that&#x2019;s out there. I mean, maybe to some extent it is, but it&#x2019;s also a deliberate strategy that people with interests in continuing, for example, the fossil fuel economy, have deliberately tried to cloud the issue to create distrust in science to create phony studies that make it seem that climate change isn&#x2019;t real. We thought a little bit about this at GCRI about how this might happen with artificial intelligence. You can imagine that somebody with a financial interest might try to discredit the risks and make it seem safer than it is, and maybe they even believe that to some extent, nobody really wants to believe that the thing that&#x2019;s getting them a lot of money is actually evil. So I think distrust in science really isn&#x2019;t an accident and it&#x2019;s a deliberate strategy and it&#x2019;s difficult to know how to combat it. There are strategies you can take, but it&#x2019;s a struggle, right? There are people who have an interest in keeping scientific results quiet.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> Yeah. Do you have any thoughts then about how we could increase the uptake of using forecasting methodologies for all manner of decision making? It seems like generally you&#x2019;re pessimistic about it right now.</p><p><strong>Robert de Neufville:</strong> Yeah. I am a little pessimistic about it. I mean one thing is that I think that we&#x2019;ve tried to get people interested in our forecasts and a lot of people just don&#x2019;t know what to do with them. Now one thing I think is interesting is that often people, they&#x2019;re not interested in my saying, &#x201C;There&#x2019;s a 78% chance of something happening.&#x201D; What they want to know is, how did I get there? What is my arguments? That&#x2019;s not unreasonable. I really like thinking in terms of probabilities, but I think it often helps people understand what the mechanism is because it tells them something about the world that might help them make a decision. So I think one thing that maybe can be done is not to treat it as a black box probability, but to have some kind of algorithmic transparency about our thinking because that actually helps people, might be more useful in terms of making decisions than just a number.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> So is there anything else here that you want to add about COVID-19 in particular? General information or intuitions that you have about how things will go? What the next year will look like? There is tension in the federal government about reopening. There&#x2019;s an eagerness to do that, to restart the economy. The US federal government and the state governments seem totally unequipped to do the kind of testing and contact tracing that is being done in successful areas like South Korea. Sometime in the short to medium term we&#x2019;ll be open and there might be the second wave and it&#x2019;s going to take a year or so for a vaccine. What are your intuitions and feelings or forecasts about what the next year will look like?</p><p><strong>Robert de Neufville:</strong> Again, with the caveat that I&#x2019;m not a virologist or not an expert in vaccine development and things like that, I have thought about this a lot. I think there was a fantasy, still is a fantasy that we&#x2019;re going to have what they call a V-shape recovery that&#x2026; you know everything crashed really quickly. Everyone started filing for unemployment as all the businesses shut down. Very different than other types of financial crises, this virus economics. But there was this fantasy that we would sort of put everything on pause, put the economy into some cryogenic freeze, and somehow keep people able to pay their bills for a certain amount of time. And then after a few months, we&#x2019;d get some kind of therapy or vaccine or it would die down and suppress the disease somehow. And then we would just give it a jolt of adrenaline and we&#x2019;d be back and everyone would be back in their old jobs and things would go back to normal. I really don&#x2019;t think that is what&#x2019;s going to happen. I think it is almost thermodynamically harder to put things back together than it is to break them. That there are things about the US economy in particular, the fact that in order to keep getting paid, you actually need to lose your job and go on unemployment, in many cases. It&#x2019;s not seamless. It&#x2019;s hard to even get through on the phone lines or to get the funding.</p><p>I think that even after a few months, the US economy is going to look like a town that&#x2019;s been hit by a hurricane and we&#x2019;re going to have to rebuild a lot of things. And maybe unemployment will go down faster than it did in previous recessions where it was more about a bubble popping or something, but I just don&#x2019;t think that we go back to normal.</p><p>I also just don&#x2019;t think we go back to normal in a broader sense. This idea that we&#x2019;re going to have some kind of cure. Again, I&#x2019;m not a virologist, but I don&#x2019;t think we typically have a therapy that cures viruses the way you know antibiotics might be super efficacious against bacteria. Typically, viral diseases, I think are things we have to try to mitigate and some cocktail may improve treatments and we may figure out better things to do with ventilators. Well, you might get the fatality rate down, but it&#x2019;s still going to be pretty bad.</p><p>And then there is this idea maybe we&#x2019;ll have a vaccine. I&#x2019;ve heard people who know more than I do say maybe it&#x2019;s possible to get a vaccine by November. But, the problem is until you can simulate with a supercomputer what happens in the human body, you can&#x2019;t really speed up biological trials. You have to culture things in people and that takes time.</p><p>You might say, well, let&#x2019;s don&#x2019;t do all the trials, this is an emergency. But the fact is, if you don&#x2019;t demonstrate that a vaccine is safe and efficacious, you could end up giving something to people that has serious adverse effects, or even makes you more susceptible to disease. That was problem one of the SARS vaccines they tried to come up with. Originally, is it made people more susceptible. So you don&#x2019;t want to hand out millions and millions of doses of something that&#x2019;s going to actually hurt people, and that&#x2019;s the danger if you skip these clinical trials. So it&#x2019;s really hard to imagine a vaccine in the near future.</p><p>I don&#x2019;t want to sell short human ingenuity because we&#x2019;re really adaptable, smart creatures, and we&#x2019;re throwing all our resources at this. But, there is a chance that there is really no great vaccine for this virus. We haven&#x2019;t had great luck with finding vaccines for coronaviruses. It seems to do weird things to the human immune system and maybe there is evidence that immunity doesn&#x2019;t stick around that long. It&#x2019;s possible that we come up with a vaccine that only provides partial immunity and doesn&#x2019;t last that long. And I think there is a good chance that essentially we have to keep social distancing well into 2021 and that this could be a disease that remains dangerous and we have to continue to keep fighting for years potentially.</p><p>I think that we&#x2019;re going to open up and it is important to open up as soon as we can because what&#x2019;s happening with the economy will literally kill people and cause famines. But on the other hand, we&#x2019;re going to get outbreaks that come back up again. You know it&#x2019;s going to be a like fanning coals if we open up too quickly and in some places we&#x2019;re not going to get it right and that doesn&#x2019;t save anyone&#x2019;s life. I mean, if it starts up again and the virus disrupts the economy again. So I think this is going to be a thing we are struggling to find a balance to mitigate and that we&#x2019;re not going to go back to December 2019 for a while, not this year. Literally, it may be years.</p><p>And I think that although humans have amazing capacity to forget things and go back to normal life. I think that we&#x2019;re going to see permanent changes. I don&#x2019;t know exactly what they are. But, I think we&#x2019;re going to see permanent changes in the way we live. And I don&#x2019;t know if I&#x2019;m ever shaking anyone&#x2019;s hands again. We&#x2019;ll see about that. A whole generation of people are going to be much better at washing their hands.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> Yeah. I&#x2019;ve already gotten a lot better at washing my hands watching tutorials.</p><p><strong>Robert de Neufville:</strong> I was terrible at it. I had no idea how bad I was.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> Yeah, same. I hope people who have shaken my hand in the past aren&#x2019;t listening. So the things that will stop this are sufficient herd immunity to some extent or a vaccine that is efficacious. Those seem like the, okay, it&#x2019;s about time to go back to normal points, right?</p><p><strong>Robert de Neufville:</strong> Yeah.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> A vaccine is not a given thing given the class of coronavirus diseases and how they behave?</p><p><strong>Robert de Neufville:</strong> Yeah. Eventually now this is where I really feel like I&#x2019;m not a virologist, but eventually diseases evolve and we co-evolve with them. Whatever the Spanish Flu was, it didn&#x2019;t continue to kill as many people years down the line. I think that&#x2019;s because people did develop immunity.</p><p>But also, viruses don&#x2019;t get any evolutionary advantage from killing their hosts. They want to use us to reproduce. Well, they don&#x2019;t want anything, but that advantages them. If they kill us and make us use mitigation strategies, that hurts their ability to reproduce. So in the long run, and I don&#x2019;t know how long that run is, but eventually we co-evolve with it and it becomes endemic instead of epidemic and it&#x2019;s presumably not as lethal. But, I think that it is something that we could be fighting for a while.</p><p>There is chances of additional disasters happening on top of it. We could get another disease popping out of some animal population while our immune systems are weak or something like that. So we should probably be rethinking the way we interact with caves full of bats and live pangolins.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> All right. We just need to be prepared for the long haul here.</p><p><strong>Robert de Neufville:</strong> Yeah, I think so.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> I&#x2019;m not sure that most people understand that.</p><p><strong>Robert de Neufville:</strong> I don&#x2019;t think they do. I mean, I guess I don&#x2019;t have my finger on the pulse and I&#x2019;m not interacting with people anymore, but I don&#x2019;t think people want to understand it. It&#x2019;s hard. I had plans. I did not intend to be staying in my apartment. Having your health is more important and the health of others, but it&#x2019;s hard to face that we may be dealing with a very different new reality.</p><p>This thing, the opening up in Georgia, it&#x2019;s just completely insane to me. Their cases have been slowing, but if it&#x2019;s shrinking, it seems to be only a little bit. To me, when they talk about opening up, it sounds like they&#x2019;re saying, well, we reduced the extent of this forest fire by 15%, so we can stop fighting it now. Well, it&#x2019;s just going to keep growing. But, you have to actually stamp it out or get really close to it before you can stop fighting it. I think people want to stop fighting the disease sooner than we should because it sucks. I don&#x2019;t want to be doing this.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> Yeah, it&#x2019;s a new sad fact and there is a lot of suffering going on right now.</p><p><strong>Robert de Neufville:</strong> Yeah. I feel really lucky to be in a place where there aren&#x2019;t a lot of cases, but I worry about family members in other places and I can&#x2019;t imagine what it&#x2019;s like in places where it&#x2019;s bad.</p><p>I mean, in Hawaii, people in the hospitality industry and tourism industry have all lost their jobs all at once and they still have to pay our super expensive rent. Maybe that&#x2019;ll be waived and they won&#x2019;t be evicted. But, that doesn&#x2019;t mean they can necessarily get medications and feed their family. And all of these are super challenging for a lot of people.</p><p>Nevermind that other people are in the position of, they&#x2019;re lucky to have jobs, but they&#x2019;re maybe risking getting an infection going to work, so they have to make this horrible choice. And maybe they have someone with comorbidities or who is elderly living at home. This is awful. So I understand why people really want to get past this part of it soon.</p><p>Was it Dr. Fauci that said, &#x201C;The virus has its own timeline?&#x201D;</p><p>One of the things I think that this may be teaching us, it&#x2019;s certainly reminding me that humans are not in charge of nature, not the way we think we are. We really dominate the planet in a lot of ways, but it&#x2019;s still bigger than us. It&#x2019;s like the ocean or something. You know? You may think you&#x2019;re a good swimmer, but if you get a big wave, you&#x2019;re not in control anymore and this is a big wave.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> Yeah. So back to the point of general superforecasting. Suppose you&#x2019;re a really good superforecaster and you&#x2019;re finding well-defined things to make predictions about, which is, as you said, sort of hard to do and you have carefully and honestly compared your predictions to reality and you feel like you&#x2019;re doing really well.</p><p>How do you convince other people that you&#x2019;re a great predictor when almost everyone else is making lots of vague predictions and cherry picking their successes or their interests groups that are biasing and obscuring things to try to have a seat at the table? Or for example, if you want to compare yourself to someone else who has been keeping a careful track as well, how do you do that technically?</p><p><strong>Robert de Neufville:</strong> I wish I knew the answer to that question. I think it is probably a long process of building confidence and communicating reasonable forecasts and having people see that they were pretty accurate. People trust something like FiveThirthyEight, Nate Silvers&#x2019;, or Nick Cohen, or someone like that because they have been communicating for a while and people can now see it. They have this track record and they also are explaining how it happens, how they get to those answers. And at least a lot of people started to trust what Nate Silver says. So I think something like that really is the longterm strategy.</p><p>But, I think it&#x2019;s hard because a lot of times there is always someone who is saying every different thing at any given time. And if somebody says there is definitely a pandemic going to happen, and they do it in November 2019, then a lot of people may think, &#x201C;Wow, that person&#x2019;s a prophet and we should listen to them.&#x201D;</p><p>To my mind, if you were saying that in November of 2019, that wasn&#x2019;t a great prediction. I mean, you turned out to be right, but you didn&#x2019;t have good reasons for it. At that point, it was still really uncertain unless you had access to way more information than as far as I know anyone had access to.</p><p>But, you know sometimes those magic tricks where somebody throws a dart at something and happens to hit the bullseye might be more convincing than an accurate probabilistic forecast. I think that in order to sell the accurate probabilistic forecasts, you really need to build a track record of communication and build confidence slowly.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> All right, that makes sense.</p><p>So on prediction markets and prediction aggregators, they&#x2019;re pretty well set up to treat questions like will X happen by Y date where X is some super well-defined thing. But lots of things we&#x2019;d like to know are not really of this form. So what are other useful forms of question about the future that you come across in your work and what do you think are the prospects for training and aggregating skilled human predictors to tackle them?</p><p><strong>Robert de Neufville:</strong> What are the other forms of questions? There is always a trade off with designing question between sort of the rigor of the question, how easy it is to say whether it turned out to be true or not and how relevant it is to things you might actually want to know. Now, that&#x2019;s often difficult to balance.</p><p>I think that in general we need to be thinking more about questions, so I wouldn&#x2019;t say here is the different type of question that we should be answering. But rather, let&#x2019;s really try to spend a lot of time thinking about the questions. What questions could be useful to answer? I think just that exercise is important.</p><p>I think things like science fiction are important where they brainstorm a possible scenario and they often fill it out with a lot of detail. But, I often think in forecasting, coming up with very specific scenarios is kind of the enemy. If you come up with a lot of things that could plausibly happen and you build it into one scenario and you think this is the thing that&#x2019;s going to happen, well the more specific you&#x2019;ve made that scenario, the less likely it is to actually be the exact right one.</p><p>We need to do more thinking about spaces of possible things that could happen, ranges of things, different alternatives rather than just coming up with scenarios and anchoring on them as the thing that happens. So I guess I&#x2019;d say more questions and realize that at least as far as we&#x2019;re able to know, I don&#x2019;t know if the universe is deterministic, but at least as far as we are able to know, a lot of different things are possible and we need to think about those possibilities and potentially plan for them.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> All right. And so, let&#x2019;s say you had 100 professors with deep subject matter expertise in say, 10 different subjects and you had 10 superforecasters, how would you make use of all of them and on what sorts of topics would you consult, what group or combination of groups?</p><p><strong>Robert de Neufville:</strong> That&#x2019;s a good question. I think we bash on subject matter experts because they&#x2019;re bad at producing probabilistic forecasts. But the fact is that I completely depend on subject matter experts. When I try to forecast what&#x2019;s going to happen on the pandemic, I am reading all the virologists and infectious disease experts because I don&#x2019;t know anything about this. I mean, I know I get some stuff wrong. Although, I&#x2019;m in a position where I can actually ask people, hey what is this, and get their explanations for it.</p><p>But, I would like to see them working together. To some extent, having some of the subject matter experts recognize that we may know some things about estimating probabilities that they don&#x2019;t. But also, the more I can communicate with people that know specific facts about things, the better the forecasts I can produce are. I don&#x2019;t know what the best system for that is. I&#x2019;d like to see more communication. But, I also think you could get some kind of a thing where you put them in a room or on a team together to produce forecasts.</p><p>When I&#x2019;m forecasting, typically, I come up with my own forecast and then I see what other people have said. But, I do that so as not to anchor on somebody else&#x2019;s opinion and to avoid groupthink. You&#x2019;re more likely to get groupthink if you have a leader and a team that everyone defers to and then they all anchor on whatever the leader&#x2019;s opinion is. So, I try to form my own independent opinion.</p><p>But, I think some kind of a Delphi technique where people will come up with their own ideas and then share them and then revise their ideas could be useful and you could involve subject matter experts in that. I would love to be able to just sit and talk with epidemiologist about this stuff. I don&#x2019;t know if they would love it as much to talk to me and I don&#x2019;t know. But I think that, that would help us collectively produce better forecasts.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> I am excited and hopeful for the top few percentage of superforecasters being integrated into more decision making about key issues. All right, so you have your own podcast.</p><p><strong>Robert de Neufville:</strong> Yeah.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> If people are interested in following you or looking into more of your work at the Global Catastrophic Riss Institute, for example, or following your podcast or following you on social media, where can they do that?</p><p><strong>Robert de Neufville:</strong> Go to the Global Catastrophic Risk Institute&#x2019;s website, it&#x2019;s gcrinstitute.org, so you can see and read about our work. It&#x2019;s super interesting and I believe super important. We&#x2019;re doing a lot of work now on artificial intelligence risk. There has been a lot of interest in that. But, we also talk about nuclear war risk and there is going to be I think a new interest in pandemic risk. So these are things that we think about. I also do have a podcast. I co-host it with two other superforecasters, which sometimes becomes sort of like a forecasting politics variety hour. But we have a good time and we do some interviews with other superforecasters and we&#x2019;ve also talked to people about existential risk and artificial intelligence. That&#x2019;s called NonProphets. We have a blog, nonprophetspod.wordpress.org. But Nonprophets, it&#x2019;s N-O-N-P-R-O-P-H-E-T-S like prophet like someone who sees the future, because we are not prophets. However, there is also another podcast, which I&#x2019;ve never listened to and feel like I should, which also has the same name. There is an atheist podcast out of Texas and atheist comedians. I apologize for taking their name, but we&#x2019;re not them, so if there is any confusion. One of the things about forecasting is it&#x2019;s super interesting and it&#x2019;s a lot of fun, at least for people like me to think about things in this way, and there are ways like Good Judgment Open you can do it too. So we talk about that. It&#x2019;s fun. And I recommend everyone get into forecasting.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> All right. Thanks so much for coming on and I hope that more people take up forecasting. And it&#x2019;s a pretty interesting lifelong thing that you can participate in and see how well you do over time and keep resolving over actual real world stuff. I hope that more people take this up and that it gets further and more deeply integrated into communities of decision makers on important issues.</p><p><strong>Robert de Neufville:</strong> Yeah. Well, thanks for having me on. It&#x2019;s a super interesting conversation. I really appreciate talking about this stuff.</p>",Palus Astra,palus-astra,Palus Astra,

(I&apos;ve been unable to determine whether it was Diffie or Hellman; sources conflict and I no longer own the book.)</p><blockquote>&#x2026;the way to get to the top of the heap in terms of developing original research is to be a fool, because only fools keep trying.&#xA0; You have idea number 1, you get excited, and it flops.&#xA0; The you have idea number 2, you get excited, and it flops.&#xA0; Then you have idea number 99, you get excited, and it flops.&#xA0; Only a fool would be excited by the 100th idea, but it might take 100 ideas before one really pays off.&#xA0; Unless you&#x2019;re foolish enough to be continually excited, you won&#x2019;t have the motivation, you won&#x2019;t have the energy to carry it through.&#xA0; God rewards fools.</blockquote><p>I am a habitual naysayer, like many people in this community. Recently, I&apos;ve been thinking about this in the context of holiday and ritual design, which is my primary preoccupation in terms of contributing to the rationalist project. As I&apos;ve <a href=""https://thepdv.wordpress.com/2020/03/19/ritual-inception/"">written about recently</a>, this is an extremely high-risk, high-reward enterprise; the upside potential is substantial but the downside potential is <em>enormous</em>. Which means that many ideas are needed before you get something that&apos;s +EV to actually try and implement, and many of those attempts will be needed before you get something that&apos;s +EV to try and sustain. I&apos;d guess that 1000 ideas : 100 fleshed-out ideas : 10 meatspace attempts : 1 sustainable result is about right.</p><p>This has a couple important consequences:</p><ul><li>Most current holidays are probably not good enough.</li></ul><p>Ray Arnold and others possess the incredibly vital capacity of <em>actually doing things</em> rather than waiting for something perfect. However, this is in accordance with the old Facebook motto: &quot;Move fast and break things.&quot; They move fast, but they will, accordingly, break things. Which for Facebook meant &quot;we will sometimes ship code that breaks the site&quot; and here means &quot;we will sometimes establish holidays and rituals which are not actually good for our community&quot;. Years of iteration have improved several MVPs which were probably -EV initially into fleshed-out versions which are solidly +EV. But they&apos;re still probably not good enough. I&apos;d guess, based purely on a gut attempt to gauge what my aliefs are about it, that Solstice is good enough and everything else isn&apos;t, though I think everything that&apos;s still being tried is +EV overall, i.e. better than nothing.</p><ul><li>&quot;God rewards fools.&quot;</li></ul><p>It does take enough ideas that only a fool would be excited, but you have to keep going before you get to one that really pays off.&#xA0; &quot;Unless you&#x2019;re foolish enough to be continually excited, you won&#x2019;t have the motivation, you won&#x2019;t have the energy to carry it through.&quot; The filtering provided by naysayers is vital, because most of the ideas actually will flop, and when you&apos;re playing with <a href=""https://thepdv.wordpress.com/2020/03/19/ritual-inception/"">alief inception</a>, a flop is very dangerous. But we do need to keep trying, because the upside is, correspondingly, very large.</p><p>I suspect this also applies to pretty much any other endeavor in creating novel ideas, but I have no direct experience so I can&apos;t be at all sure.</p>",JacobKopczynski,czynski,Czynski,

If there were some easy way to reliably make a fortune on the stock market, it would have already been done, and the opportunity would be gone. If some obvious theory explained all the known data on some phenomenon better than the current mainstream theory, that theory would already have been published and widely adopted. If there were some simple way to build a better, cheaper mousetrap, it would already be on the market.</p><p>Look back - one of those three is not like the others.</p><p>One nice property of markets is that it only takes a small number of people to remove an inefficiency. Once the better, cheaper mousetrap hits the market, the old mousetraps become obsolete; the new mousetrap is adopted even if there are initially many more old-mousetrap-makers than new-mousetrap-makers. Same with the stock market: even if most investors don&#x2019;t notice a pattern, it only takes a handful to notice the opportunity and remove it. Competition drives market-beating profits to zero with only a handful of competitors, even if everyone else in the market misses the opportunity.</p><p>But academia is a different story.</p><p>In order for a theory to be adopted within an academic field, <em>most</em> people in the field must recognize the theory&#x2019;s advantages. If a theory has fatal flaw which most people in the field won&#x2019;t understand (e.g. because of insufficient mathematical fluency), it doesn&#x2019;t matter how comprehensively fatal the flaw is, the theory won&#x2019;t be dropped until some easier-to-understand evidence comes along (e.g. direct experimental refutation of the theory). A handful of people who understand the problem might sound the alarm, but that won&#x2019;t be enough social signal to stand out from the constant social noise of people arguing for/against the theory in other ways.</p><p>Some examples of ways this might happen:</p><ul><li>Most people in the field don&#x2019;t understand statistical significance</li><li>Most people in the field don&#x2019;t understand confounding</li><li>Most people in the field can&#x2019;t distinguish a predictive theory from <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/8QzZKw9WHRxjR4948/the-futility-of-emergence"">phlogiston</a></u></li><li>Most people in the field don&#x2019;t have a notion of <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/gvK5QWRLk3H8iqcNy/gears-vs-behavior"">gears</a></u>/<u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/hzuSDMx7pd2uxFc5w/causal-diagrams-and-causal-models"">causality</a></u>, or don&#x2019;t see why it matters</li><li>Most people in the field don&#x2019;t understand <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/d4DvqS88Q29ZaJAj3/homeostasis-and-root-causes-in-aging"">equilibrium reasoning</a></u></li></ul><p>Now, as long as people in the field recognize the importance of correctly predicting experimental outcomes, the right theory will probably win out <em>eventually</em>. But we should still expect to see low-hanging fruit in the meantime, among theories not yet fully nailed down by experiment. </p><p>People who do understand these sorts of things should expect to see obvious problems in the theories of fields where most people don&#x2019;t understand these things. Of course, that doesn&#x2019;t mean we can win fame in the field just by pointing out these errors - quite the opposite. The whole point is that the structure of academia means that one person <em>can&#x2019;t</em> correct the errors of a field, when that field does not have the background needed to understand the error. But it does mean that, if we want to understand the topic of such a field for reasons <em>other</em> than making a career as an academic, then we should not be surprised if we can theorize better than the supposed experts. We don&#x2019;t need to outperform the best in order to outperform the field; we just need to outperform the average.</p>",johnswentworth,johnswentworth,johnswentworth,

<p>I decided to go by week because reporting on different days of the week is different. Tuesdays and Wednesdays have a bigger share, while weekends have lower shares. There’s also a lot of day-to-day noise in general. Number of tests fluctuates wildly. By combining weeks, we get a much easier to understand picture, and there’s now enough data that we can do this.</p>
<h3>New York: We Can Make It There</h3>
<p>The picture for New York is clear and excellent. The new R0 calculation comes in as R0 ~ 0.78, if we assume a five day serial interval. Using deaths and using infections each give us the same answer, so it seems very solid.</p>
<p>It does raise one important note about timing.</p>
<p>New York’s rate of infections detected peaked in the first week of April as did its positive test percentage. They then decline a little in the second week of April and fall dramatically in the third week.</p>
<p>Deaths peaked the second week of April then fall off dramatically. This dates the infection peak to about 21 days earlier, which would be on or right after the lock down date. That makes sense.</p>
<p>Infections peaking only a few days before deaths implies a <em>very </em>delayed testing schedule. Perhaps more so than is even plausible, but certainly more than I was previously taking into account. I think we have to presume that if deaths lag by 21 days, a positive diagnosis has to be at least 10 days delayed, under the conditions at the time. It should be <em>somewhat </em>less now.</p>
<p>That’s excellent news. What about other places?</p>
<h3>Other Regions: Can We Make It Anywhere (Else)?</h3>
<p>We see the positive test percentage falling around the country. That’s very good news. It does reflect increased testing, and may reflect increased focus of testing on places that need it the least. That worries me.</p>
<p>If look at the West region, we see a slow but steady increase in deaths. California is steady from this week to last week, but increasing from before that. It has a very low baseline, which is great, but things are not improving.</p>
<p>We also see a similar pattern of things slowly getting worse in the Midwest.</p>
<p>The non-NY Northeast region looks like it is finally getting somewhat better. But it’s happening later and slower than New York. The timing is weird, and there are some funky artifacts in the data contributing to that. Pennsylvania’s data is a real mess and New Jersey’s isn’t much better, and since we’re excluding New York that’s a huge percentage of the whole region.</p>
<p>The South was also starting to show slow improvement, but now it’s starting to reopen. As I’ve noted before, the ‘reopen’ criteria being used makes no sense. So it seems unlikely that the improvements will be sustained. There is extreme difference between states here. Virginia’s cases are suddenly going way up, whereas there seem to be clear previous peaks for some other states such as Louisiana. Louisiana, and New Orleans in particular, seems important to understanding the general picture.</p>
<p>The overall positive test percentage does continue to slowly decline. That is good news, but the decline is small, comes along with modestly increased testing, and likely it partly reflects changes in the distribution of who is doing the testing. I’ll learn more about that if/when I get to dive further into the states and cities one at a time and see if that’s true. It would be good to try normalizing for test locations, but I haven’t seen anyone do that.</p>
<h3>Getting Worse Before It Gets Better: Louisiana</h3>

<p>Louisiana’s data is a royal mess. I’m not listing positive test percentages, because they’re nonsense. From April 18 to April 25, the number of <em>cumulative </em>reported negative tests <em>went down. </em>There’s no later day where it looks like their reporting caught up. We realistically have no idea how much testing is taking place. Despite this they claim an <em>overall </em>positive rate of only 21.4%, and below 20% each day since April 11 (not counting days when they reported zero or less than zero negatives).</p>
<p>The drop-off in deaths we’ve seen so far seems nowhere near dramatic enough to be compatible with the drop in positive test results, unless testing collapsed, which the negative test counts claim didn’t happen.</p>
<p>Still, this seems like a clear explosion and fast peak, followed by a clear negative trend.</p>
<p>We can do a similar calculation to the one I previously did for New York. We take the deaths, backdate them three weeks, assume IFR of 1%, a serial interval of 5 and an R0 that matches the data, and see how many infections we get. In this case, we can use the decline in deaths on a weekly basis to estimate the R0. We get about 0.8. If we check that against the positive test counts from April 9 onward, we 0.775. Close enough. Let’s split the difference and say 0.79. Correcting for 50% under-count of deaths we get 328,344 infected out of a population of 4.65 million. That’s only 7.1% of the state infected.</p>
<p>A big difference is that only 391,000, or less than 10% of that amount, live in New Orleans, versus almost half of New York state being in New York City.</p>
<p>Redoing the calculation for only Orleans Perish, which has 27.4% of the deaths (found by Google giving me stats directly, and me dividing Orleans’ count by the total from all perishes) and only 8.4% of the state’s population, I get 22.5% infected in New Orleans. That’s lower than my estimate for NYC, but it’s more than halfway there.</p>
<p>If we refer back to the log of <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2020/04/07/on-r0/"">On R0</a>, even the 7.1% infection rate is a big game. The difference between 7.1% for Louisiana, and much smaller numbers for most of the United States, explains how California can be in limbo around R0=1 while Louisiana has turned the corner.</p>
<p>Is there another explanation for why the epicenters seem to be improving, while places that are doing ‘everything right’ but were not epicenters are not seeing that? I don’t see a case available that Louisiana is taking things especially seriously, or implementing better or stricter policies than the West.</p>
<h3>Limbo</h3>
<p>The explanation that makes sense to me is that <em>lock downs in the American style, by default, create R0 very close to 1. </em></p>
<p>We see improvements in places with some herd immunity, or which are especially well locked down or otherwise situated. While others, where we’re falling short, get worse.</p>
<p>Which is all, in some sense, the worst possible situation.</p>
<p>You can’t squash. You’re forced into a holding pattern that devastates your economy without building the herd immunity that would let you come out of it. Eventually, you’re forced out, and you end up with the same wave you would have had earlier, except now you’ve used up your ability to lock down your population. You don’t have the capacity to squash.</p>
<p>However, <em>once you have substantial amounts of infection, </em>that pushes things over the top. The people infected are not random, they reduce risk more than proportionally, and thus are able to drag places with earlier higher infection rates into a stable place.</p>
<p>Thus, we need to do some combination of improving the effectiveness of our lock downs, and allowing people to become infected fast enough to matter.</p>
<p>Unless we think we can afford to sustain things until a vaccine or very effective treatment comes along. That doesn’t seem that likely at this point.</p>
<p>If we can’t come up with something better and can’t experiment, the logical response to this situation is <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2020/04/01/taking-initial-viral-load-seriously/"">variolation</a>. We could infect the young and healthy on purpose, with low viral loads, to create enough immunity to turn the corner. Alas, we are highly unlikely to do this.</p>
<p>Thus, second best solutions prove necessary.</p>
<h3>Reopening</h3>
<p>Which means that a partial reopening soon, as crazy as it seems and as misguided as the reasoning being used might be, starts to make some sense.</p>
<p>As does opening <em>tattoo parlors </em>and <em>gyms </em>in the first wave, as in Georgia. At first I thought, what the hell, that doesn’t make any sense. Lobbyists at their worst. That perhaps makes sense for gyms, but I doubt anyone is especially in the pocket of Big Tattoo.</p>
<p>Opening tattoo parlors, where social distancing seems obviously impossible, and which are obviously completely inessential, is a way of selecting for people most likely to go around getting themselves infected, and also most likely to be relatively young and healthy, and gives them somewhere to expose each other. Gyms can serve a similar function.</p>
<p>There’s also the fact that given <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2020/04/29/on-covid-19-superspreader-events-in-28-countries-critical-patterns-and-lessons/"">what we know</a>, a lot of the things being closed make things worse rather than better. Or at least, a full closing of them is worse than a partial closing.</p>
<p>If you open restaurants at 25% capacity, it’s not obvious at all that this increases risk. I think there’s a strong case that it decreases it, instead. Grocery stores are overloaded. By going to the restaurant instead, you reduce density at the grocery store, reducing wait times for others and the number of interactions while gathering items. You reduce strain on the supply chain, which reduces how often people need to make trips to get what they need. You also enable places to get enough business to stay open that would otherwise have to close, allowing them to offer takeout and delivery.</p>
<p>You might already be winning at that point. If you could also convince everyone to eat in silence, and order off of apps on their phones? I’m guessing you’re winning. If you can do outside seating, you’re <em>definitely </em>winning.</p>
<p>It really could go either way. It potentially helps a lot in increasing our ability to sustain other measures for a longer period.</p>
<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<p>Due to the speed premium, I’m getting what I have out there now rather than waiting for next steps. It’s possible all of this is a little selective, yesterday (4/29) was an aberration of some kind, and things are better than they look.</p>
<p>The next step would be to look at the data state by state, area by area, and try to make better sense of it. I worry I’m mostly talking into the wind with these analyses. I hope not. I do know I’ve made enough of a difference, in a few small places, to justify continuing to try.</p>
<p>If I know you, or I should know you, and you’d be interested in chatting about what’s going on and helping figure things out, and perhaps even helping get better decisions made, or just want to let me know I’m not shouting into the wind, give me a buzz however you typically reach me. I’m at the point where it starts to make sense for me to start writing code. If you know me at all, me writing code is a sign that division of labor has probably gone horribly wrong.</p>

They have no sense of fear or self-preservation, and come up with endlessly creative ways to place themselves in mortal peril. Once they learn to talk, their constant experimentation with the world transcends the physical to the philosophical. They want to know <em>everything</em>. They are bottomless pits of curiosity, with very little in the way of attention span or self-discipline. Your typical two-year-old can only concentrate on a task for six minutes at a time. Young children are not self-aware enough to feel much in the way of shame, or embarrassment. Nothing is off-limits.</p><p>In a word, very young people spend almost all of their time <em>exploring</em>.</p><p>The elderly are set in their ways. The only foreign objects they put in their mouths are dentures and hard caramels; occasionally followed by a fork to extricate said caramels from said dentures. They tend to have stable routines, rituals, hobbies, and social circles. They rarely try new things or experiment with new identities. They&#x2019;ve lived long enough to know what they&#x2019;re about, and they intend to wring out every ounce of enjoyment before the curtains come down.</p><p>In a word, very old people spend almost all of their time <em>exploiting</em>.</p><p>The &#x2018;explore-exploit&#x2019; constraint is one of the most useful ideas I&#x2019;ve come across. Don&#x2019;t worry about the connotations; these terms are borrowed from computer science, where they&#x2019;re used neutrally.</p><p>The point is that there&#x2019;s an inescapable trade-off between these activities. Time spent investigating new opportunities is time you could have spent enjoying what you already have, and vice versa.</p><p>In the language of optionality: if you want to open up attractive new options&#x2014;to cultivate the fat purple figs on <a href=""https://thedeepdish.org/constraints-that-liberate/"">the possibility tree</a>&#x2014;you have to spend time <em>exploring</em>. But unless you eventually switch to <em>exploiting</em>, all your precious figs will blacken and rot and fall to the ground.</p><p>This creates dilemmas great and small: Keep your job or pivot to a new career? Try the new Chinese place or return to your favourite haunt?</p><h1><strong>The Multi-Armed Bandit</strong></h1><p>The classic explore-exploit scenario is the &#x2018;multi-armed bandit&#x2019;.</p><p>You walk into a casino, and are faced with countless banks of slot machines. Some of the machines pay out more often than others, but there&#x2019;s no way of finding out which ones are &#x2018;hot&#x2019; without sitting down and pulling the arm over and over.</p><p>Let&#x2019;s say the very first machine you try pays out an average of one in every 10 pulls. If you choose to wander off and start pulling different levers, you&#x2019;re forsaking the opportunity to receive that tried-and-tested reward. But if you stick with the first machine, you&#x2019;re forsaking the opportunity to search for an arm with a higher payoff.</p><p>There&#x2019;s no need to get into the formal solutions, because the optimal strategy is fairly intuitive: you start out by exploring as much as possible, and gradually move towards exploiting as your time runs out.</p><p>And this is exactly how we behave throughout our lives, even if we&#x2019;re not consciously aware of it. <em>Of course</em> an old person isn&#x2019;t going to try lots of new things with uncertain payoffs: their remaining time is limited. <em>Of course</em> a young person isn&#x2019;t going to stick with the very first hobby, job, or lifestyle practice they try: they can almost certainly find better rewards by experimenting.</p><p>Which gives us our first heuristic for the timing component of collecting optionality:</p><p><em><strong>When you have little to lose and everything to gain, volatility is your friend. Front-load as much randomness into your life as possible, run a lot of experiments, and then slowly temper over time.</strong></em></p><p>Explore-exploit is not a binary. It&#x2019;s more like a dimmer switch that you adjust during different stages of life, spending more or less time in each mode.</p><p>In the formal solutions to the multi-armed bandit, it pays to remain curious in the face of uncertainty. And in real life, old people rarely become completely calcified and closed off to opportunities. They can, and should, remain open to a little exploring, right up until the point when they&#x2019;re no longer buying green bananas.</p><p>Which brings us to the second heuristic: <strong><em>we&#x2019;re not exploring nearly enough.</em></strong></p><h1><strong>Premature Exploitation</strong></h1><p>You&#x2019;re out in the countryside, in search of a scenic picnic spot. You stop to rest at the top of a hill, and look around. The surrounding landscape is obscured by mist, and you&#x2019;re not sure if you&#x2019;re at the highest point. If you want to explore any further, you&#x2019;ll have to trudge all the way back down to the bottom, and set off in another direction. So you unpack the picnic basket, and settle in.</p><p>Here&#x2019;s what you can&#x2019;t see: there&#x2019;s a much taller peak nearby, which rises above the mist and offers a spectacular view over the entire range. You might have a map that tells you it&#x2019;s out there, or hear stories from passing hikers about how great the summit is, but life is comfortable here on the small hill.</p><p>If you choose to keep exploring, it&#x2019;s not going to be easy. There&#x2019;s a huge chasm between the first-order consequences (exertion, effort, possibility of failure) and the second-order consequences (getting to an elevated position).</p><p>You&#x2019;re stuck in a local maximum. Here&#x2019;s what it looks like:</p><p><figure><img src=""https://i1.wp.com/thedeepdish.org/wp-content/uploads/local-global-maxima-hill-climbing.png?resize=700%2C400&amp;ssl=1"" class=""draft-image "" style=""width:690%""></figure></p><p>Now it&#x2019;s time to put your tinfoil hat on, and lean in while I do my best Alex Jones impression. A range of powerful forces&#x2014;biological, cultural, economic&#x2014;are conspiring to keep us trapped on that little hill, and prevent us from moving to higher ground. Those baby-harvesting demon maggots are tryin&#x2019; to take our freedom!</p><p>The first saboteur is the relentless optimising force of consumer capitalism&#x2014;and it&#x2019;s in cahoots with the DNA coiled through every cell in your body.</p><p>From <a href=""https://thedeepdish.org/wireheading/"">The Brave New World of Wireheading</a>:</p><blockquote><em>&#x2018;Superstimuli&#x2019; are distorted and amplified versions of the sensations we&#x2019;re biologically hardwired to pursue. An apple has 100 calories and lots of vitamins, a MegaThirstyGulp soda has 1000 calories and no nutritional value whatsoever, but our brains don&#x2019;t know the difference. Addictive drugs are the most obvious [superstimuli]; other mutant members of the extended family include fast food, alcohol, prescription meds, porn, reality TV, online gambling, virtual reality, and immersive video games.</em></blockquote><p>Let&#x2019;s unpack that last one. The rewards offered by a video game are a pale imitation of those available in real life, but you can get them with <em>so much more certainty</em>. Games reliably serve up hits of achievement on cue, with a near-instant feedback loop engineered to be as &#x2018;sticky&#x2019; as possible. There&#x2019;s a clearly defined pathway for completing quests, leveling up into a muscle-bound hero, and impressing scantily-clad elven princesses with your Very Big Sword.</p><p>The only problem is that none of your heroic endeavours carry over to real life, in which the only exercise you get is lifting cans of Mountain Dew, difficult quests don&#x2019;t come with convenient save points, and the scantily-clad princess is a Russian dude named Stanislav.</p><p>Here&#x2019;s the crux: if you want to climb to a higher peak, you have to go <em>down</em> before you can go up:</p><p><figure><img src=""https://i0.wp.com/thedeepdish.org/wp-content/uploads/local-maxima-hill-climbing.gif?resize=640%2C400&amp;ssl=1"" class=""draft-image "" style=""width:640%""></figure></p><p>Hill-climbing is already hard enough. When you&#x2019;re exploring unknown territory or attempting difficult things, the feedback loop between effort and reward is laggy and unpredictable. It&#x2019;s <em>doubly</em> hard when you&#x2019;re simultaneously trying to wean yourself off a reliable source of pleasure, and overcome the constant temptation to return to its mediocre but familiar embrace.</p><p>And so, it&#x2019;s no surprise that the problem of premature exploitation is so pervasive.</p><p>The full force of consumer capitalism is aimed at keeping us trapped in &#x2018;sticky&#x2019; local maxima, the moat only ever gets wider, our own biology is working against us, and we&#x2019;re infamously bad at making these kind of trade-offs&#x2014;at weighing the second, third and nth-order consequences of our actions.</p><p>In some cases, cultural norms help to keep these forces in check. There&#x2019;s a strong social stigma attached to being a &#x2018;junkie&#x2019;, for example, and various unpleasant stereotypes, like the basement-dwelling gamer trope I leaned on just before (sorry gamers, no offense intended).</p><p>In other cases, the norms are roughly neutral: for example, I&#x2019;m not sure whether being an Extremely Online &#x2018;activist&#x2019; or binge-watching a series on Netflix until the small hours count as mildly embarrassing, or a badge of honour?</p><p>But in a few cases, our norms and cultural beliefs actively push us <em>further</em> towards premature exploitation.</p><h1><strong>Our Very Restless Bandit</strong></h1><p>For most of our human and human-ish ancestors, life came at you slow<em>.</em> Nothing changed. Like, ever. You&#x2019;d almost certainly be born, grow old, and die without experiencing a single cultural or technological advance.</p><p>But you and I were born into a very weird little bubble. The same progress that once took two million years now takes all of two days. Entire new industries have come into existence since you visited the high school careers counselor, while others have shriveled and died. Imagine trying to explain Twitch streamers to your great-grandma.</p><p>Our increasingly dynamic world throws a spanner in the works of the multi-armed bandit. In that scenario, if you found a gig with a handsome payout, you could sit there pulling the lever over and over, getting fat and happy.</p><p>But in real life, <em>the</em> <em>payouts change over time</em>. Maybe the machine you&#x2019;ve settled in on goes dead on the very next pull. Meanwhile, another machine that you previously ruled out as a dud might light up and start spraying coins everywhere.</p><p>With this in mind, the conventional wisdom around careers or education starts to look pretty dated.</p><p>Traditionally, the winning strategy was to work hard and climb through the ranks to specialise in your chosen field. This would either be the family trade, or whatever path your teenage self saw fit to send you down. You draw a monthly salary, pay your dues for several decades, and eventually collect your gold watch and pension.</p><p>Working for the sake of earning a paycheck early in one&#x2019;s career is not quite as short-sighted as playing video games all day, but it&#x2019;s still an example of premature exploitation.</p><p>Instead of repetitively pulling the first lever you find, it might be better to build knowledge, skills, and connections that open up more attractive opportunities&#x2014;to keep exploring&#x2014;even if it means earning less money in the short-term. You don&#x2019;t necessarily want to specialise until you&#x2019;ve explored quite a bit more of the possibility space.</p><p>Hence venture capitalist Marc Andreesen&#x2019;s first rule of career planning: <strong><em>don&#x2019;t.</em></strong></p><p>As Andreesen <a href=""https://pmarchive.com/guide_to_career_planning_part1.html"">explains</a>, you have no idea what industries you&#x2019;ll enter, what companies you&#x2019;ll work for, what roles you&#x2019;ll have, where you&#x2019;ll live, what your preferences will be, or what you will ultimately contribute:</p><blockquote><em>The world is an incredibly complex place and everything is changing all the time&#x2026; trying to plan your career is an exercise in futility that will only serve to frustrate you, and to blind you to the really significant opportunities that life will throw your way.</em></blockquote><p>It&#x2019;s not as if older generations are deliberately dispensing stupid or malicious advice. It&#x2019;s just that the rules of the game have changed, and so has the strategy.</p><p>Mathematicians were able to solve the multi-armed bandit by coming up with clever algorithms which tell you the optimal strategy for exploring and exploiting. But once you have a <em>restless</em> bandit, the problem becomes so hard that it&#x2019;s incomputable.</p><p>This is what real life is like. And our bandit is very, very restless.</p><h1><strong>How to Go About Exploring More?</strong></h1><p>In a world ruled by uncertainty, all we have are heuristics:</p><p><em><strong>If powerful forces consistently push us toward premature exploitation, we should almost always be biased towards exploring more.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Front-load as much randomness into your life as possible, run a lot of experiments, and then slowly temper over time.</strong></em></p><p>OK. But what should these experiments look like? Size, duration, method? What kind of &#x2018;randomness&#x2019;? Where to find ideas to test out? How to think about the potential costs and benefits? When to stop tinkering?</p><p>Having made many lifestyle experiments great and small, and taken my fair share of lumps, I think I have some decent insights into this. Or at least, not-entirely-stupid ones.</p><p>In the second half of this post, I&#x2019;ll share whatever lessons I&apos;ve learned in the arena of self-experimentation.</p>",richard-meadows-1,richard-meadows-1,Richard Meadows,

<h3>Replication Markets: <a href=""https://www.replicationmarkets.com"">replicationmarkets.com</a></h3>
<p>Replication Markets is a project where volunteer forecasters try to predict whether a given study's results will be replicated with high power. Rewards are monetary, but only given out to the top N forecasters, and markets suffer from sometimes being dull. They have added <a href=""https://www.replicationmarkets.com/index.php/2020/04/16/meet-the-bots/"">two market-maker bots</a> and commenced and conclude their 6th round. They also added a sleek new widget to visualize the price of shares better.</p>
<h3>Coronavirus Information Markets: <a href=""https://coronainformationmarkets.com/"">coronainformationmarkets.com</a></h3>
<p>For those who want to put their money where their mouth is, there is now a prediction market for coronavirus related information. The number of questions is small, and the current trading volume started at $8000, but may increase. Another similar platform is <a href=""https://waves.exchange/prediction"">waves.exchange/prediction</a>, which seems to be just a wallet to which a prediction market has been grafted on.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I couldn't make a transaction in these markets with ~30 mins; the time needed to be included in an ethereum block is longer and I may have been too stingy with my gas fee.</p>

They structure their questions in challenges, to which they have recently added one on <a href=""https://www.gjopen.com/challenges/43-coronavirus-outbreak"">the Coronavirus Outbreak</a>; some of these questions are similar in spirit to the short-fuse Metaculus Tournament.</p>
<p>Of the questions which have been added recently to the Good Judgment Open, the crowd <a href=""https://www.gjopen.com/questions/1580-before-1-january-2021-will-tesla-release-an-autopilot-feature-designed-to-navigate-traffic-lights"">doesn't buy</a> that Tesla will release an autopilot feature to navigate traffic lights, despite announcements to the contrary. Further, the aggregate...</p>

<li>Of particular interest is that GJOpen didn't see the upsurge in tests (and thus positives) in the US until until the day before they happened, for <a href=""https://www.gjopen.com/questions/1599-how-many-total-cases-of-covid-19-in-the-u-s-will-the-covid-tracking-project-report-as-of-sunday-26-april-2020"">this question</a>. Forecasters, including superforecasters, went with a linear extrapolation from the previous n (usually 7) days. However, even though the number of cases looks locally linear, it's also globally exponential, as <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kas0tIxDvrg"">this 3Blue1Brown video</a> shows. On the other hand, an enterprising forecaster tried to fit a Gompertz distribution, but then fared pretty badly.</li>

5aAatvkHdPH6HT3P9,Against strong bayesianism,against-strong-bayesianism,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5aAatvkHdPH6HT3P9/against-strong-bayesianism,2020-04-30T10:48:07.678Z,63,36,65,False,False,,"<p><i>Note that this post has been edited in response to feedback and comments. In particular, I've added the word ""strong"" into the title, and an explanation of it at the beginning of the post, to be clearer what position I'm critiquing. I've also edited the discussion of Blockhead.</i></p><p>In this post I want to lay out some intuitions about why bayesianism is not very useful as a conceptual framework for thinking either about AGI or human reasoning. This is not a critique of bayesian statistical methods; it’s instead aimed at the philosophical position that bayesianism defines an ideal of rationality which should inform our perspectives on less capable agents, also known as ""strong bayesianism"". As <a href=""https://nostalgebraist.tumblr.com/post/161645122124/bayes-a-kinda-sorta-masterpost"">described here</a>:</p><blockquote><p>The Bayesian machinery is frequently used in statistics and machine learning, and some people in these fields believe it is very frequently the right tool for the job. &nbsp;I’ll call this position&nbsp;“weak Bayesianism.” &nbsp;There is a more extreme and more philosophical position, which I’ll call&nbsp;“strong Bayesianism,” that says that the Bayesian machinery is the <i>single correct way</i> to do not only statistics, but science and inductive inference in general – that it’s the&nbsp;“aspirin in willow bark” that makes science, and perhaps all speculative thought, work insofar as it <i>does</i>&nbsp;work.</p></blockquote><p>Or another way of phrasing the position, <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/bkSkRwo9SRYxJMiSY/beautiful-probability"">from Eliezer</a>:</p><blockquote><p>You may not be able to compute the optimal [Bayesian] answer. &nbsp;But whatever approximation you use, both its failures and successes will be explainable in terms of Bayesian probability theory.</p></blockquote><p>First, let’s talk about Blockhead: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockhead_(thought_experiment)"">Ned Block’s hypothetical AI</a> that consists solely of a gigantic lookup table. Consider a version of Blockhead that comes pre-loaded with the optimal actions (according to a given utility function) for any sequence of inputs which takes less than a million years to observe. So for the next million years, Blockhead will act just like an ideal superintelligent agent. Suppose I argued that we should therefore study Blockhead in order to understand advanced AI better. Why is this clearly a bad idea? Well, one problem is that Blockhead is absurdly unrealistic; you could never get anywhere near implementing it in real life. More importantly, even though Blockhead gets the right answer on all the inputs we give it, it’s not doing anything remotely like thinking or reasoning.</p><p>The general lesson here is that we should watch out for when a purported ""idealised version"" of some process is actually a different type of thing to the process itself. This is particularly true when the idealisation is unimaginably complex, because it might be hiding things in the parts which we can’t imagine. So let's think about what an ideal bayesian reasoner like a Solomonoff inductor actually does. To solve the grain of truth problem, the set of hypotheses it represents needs to include every possible way that the universe could be. We don't yet have any high-level language which can describe all these possibilities, so the only way to do so is listing all possible Turing machines. Then in order to update the probabilities in response to new evidence, it needs to know how that entire universe evolves up to the point where the new evidence is acquired.</p><p>In other words, an ideal bayesian is not <i>thinking</i> in any reasonable sense of the word - instead, it’s <i>simulating every logically possible universe</i>. By default, we should not expect to learn much about thinking based on analysing a different type of operation that just happens to look the same in the infinite limit. Similarly, the version of Blockhead I described above is basically an <i>optimal tabular policy</i> in reinforcement learning. In reinforcement learning, we’re interested in learning policies which process information about their surroundings - but the optimal tabular policy for any non-trivial environment is too large to ever be learned, and when run does not actually do any information-processing! Yet it's particularly effective as a red herring because we can do proofs about it, and because it can be calculated in some tiny environments.</p><p>You might argue that bayesianism is conceptually useful, and thereby helps real humans reason better. But I think that concepts in bayesianism are primarily useful because they have <i>suggestive names</i>, which make it hard to realise how much work our intuitions are doing to translate from ideal bayesianism to our actual lives. For more on what I mean by this, consider the following (fictional) dialogue:</p><blockquote><p>Alice the (literal-minded) agnostic: I’ve heard about this bayesianism thing, and it makes sense that I should do statistics using bayesian tools, but is there any more to it?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Bob the bayesian: Well, obviously you can’t be exactly bayesian with finite compute. But the intuition that you should try to be more like an ideal bayesian is a useful one which will help you have better beliefs about the world. In fact, most of what we consider to be “good reasoning” is some sort of approximation to bayesianism.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>A: So let me try to think more like an ideal bayesian for a while, then. Well, the first thing is - you’re telling me that a lot of the things I’ve already observed to be good reasoning are actually approximations to bayesianism, which means I should take bayesianism more seriously. But ideal bayesians don’t update on old evidence. So if I’m trying to be more like an ideal bayesian, I shouldn’t change my mind about how useful bayesianism is based on those past observations.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>B: No, that’s silly. Of course you should. Ignoring old evidence only makes sense when you’ve already fully integrated all its consequences into your understanding of the world.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>A: Oh, I definitely haven’t done that. But speaking of <i>all</i> the consequences - what if I’m in a simulation? Or an evil demon is deceiving me? Should I think about as many such skeptical hypotheses as I can, to be more like an ideal bayesian who considers every hypothesis?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>B: Well, <i>technically</i> ideal bayesians consider every hypothesis, but only because they have infinite compute! In practice you shouldn’t bother with many far-fetched hypotheses, because that’s a waste of your limited time.*</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>A: But what if I have some evidence towards that hypothesis? For example, I just randomly thought of the hypothesis that the universe has exactly a googleplex atoms in it. But there's some chance that this thought was planted in my mind by a higher power to allow me to figure out the truth! I should update on that, right?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>B: Look, in practice that type of evidence is not worth keeping track of. You need to use common sense to figure out when to actually make the effort of updating.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>A: Hmm, alright. But when it comes to the hypotheses I <i>do</i> consider, they should each be an explicit description of the entire universe, right, like an ideal bayesian’s hypotheses?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>B: No, that’s way too hard for a human to do.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>A: Okay, so I’ll use incomplete hypotheses, and then assign probabilities to each of them. I guess I should calculate as many significant digits of my credences as possible, then, to get them closer to the perfectly precise real-valued credences that an ideal bayesian has?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>B: Don’t bother. Imprecise credences are good enough except when you’re solving mathematically precise problems.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>A: Speaking of mathematical precision, I know that my credences should never be 0 or 1. But when an ideal bayesian conditions on evidence they’ve received, they’re implicitly being certain about what that evidence is. So should I also be sure that I’ve received the evidence I think I have?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>B: No-</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>A: Then since I’m skipping all these compute-intensive steps, I guess getting closer to an ideal bayesian means I also shouldn’t bother to test my hypotheses by making predictions about future events, right? Because an ideal bayesian gets no benefit from doing so - they can just make updates after they see the evidence.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>B: Well, it’s different, because you’re biased. That’s why science works, because making predictions protects you from post-hoc rationalisation.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>A: Fine then. So what does it <i>actually</i> <i>mean</i> to be more like an ideal bayesian?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>B: Well, you should constantly be updating on new evidence. And it seems like thinking of degrees of belief as probabilities, and starting from base rates, are both helpful. And then sometimes <a href=""http://yudkowsky.net/rational/bayes/"">people conditionalise wrong</a> on simple tasks, so you need to remind them how to do so.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>A: But these aren’t just bayesian ideas - frequentists are all about base rates! Same with “when the evidence changes, I change my mind” - that one’s obvious. Also, when people try to explicitly calculate probabilities, sometimes they’re <i>way</i> off.** What’s happening there?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>B: Well, in complex real-world scenarios, you can’t trust your explicit reasoning. You have to fall back on intuitions like “Even though my inside view feels very solid, and I think my calculations account for all the relevant variables, there’s still a reasonable chance that all my models are wrong.”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>A: So why do people advocate for the importance of bayesianism for thinking about complex issues if it only works in examples where all the variables are well-defined and have very simple relationships?<br><br>B: I think bayesianism has definitely made a substantial contribution to philosophy. It tells us what it even <i>means</i> to assign a probability to an event, and cuts through a lot of metaphysical bullshit.</p></blockquote><p>Back to the authorial voice. Like Alice, I'm not familiar with any principled or coherent characterisation of what trying to apply bayesianism actually means. It may seem that Alice’s suggestions are deliberately obtuse, but I claim these are the sorts of ideas you’d consider if you seriously tried to consistently “become more bayesian”, rather than just using bayesianism to justify types of reasoning you endorse for other reasons.</p><p>I agree with Bob that the bayesian perspective is useful for thinking about the <i>type signature</i> of calculating a subjective probability: it’s a function from your prior beliefs and all your evidence to numerical credences, whose quality should be evaluated using a <a href=""http://yudkowsky.net/rational/technical"">proper scoring rule</a>. But for this insight, just like Bob’s insights about using base rates and updating frequently, we don’t need to make any reference to optimality proofs or the idealised limit of <s>intelligence</s> brute force search. In fact, doing so often provides an illusion of objectivity which is ultimately harmful. I do agree that most things people identify as <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/AN2cBr6xKWCB8dRQG/what-is-bayesianism"">tenets of bayesianism</a> are useful for thinking about knowledge; but I claim that they would be just as useful, and better-justified, if we forced each one to stand or fall on its own.</p><p>* <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/tKwJQbo6SfWF2ifKh/toward-a-new-technical-explanation-of-technical-explanation"">Abram Demski has posted about</a> moving past bayesianism by accounting for logical uncertainty to a greater extent, but I think that arguments similar to the ones I’ve made above are also applicable to logical inductors (although I’m less confident about this).</p><p>** You can probably fill in your own favourite example of this. The one I was thinking about was a post where someone derived that the probability of extinction from AI was less than 1 in 10^200; but I couldn’t find it.</p>",ricraz,ricraz,Richard_Ngo,

We presently live in a world where few states actually declare war on each other or even war on each other. This is because the 1945 United Nations&#x2019; Charter&apos;s Article 2 states that UN member states should &#x201C;refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state&#x201D;, while allowing for &#x201C;military measures by UN Security Council resolutions&#x201D; and &#x201C;exercise of self-defense&#x201D;. In this theoretical ideal, wars are not declared; instead, &apos;international armed conflicts&apos; occur. However, costly interstate conflicts, both &#x2018;hot&#x2019; and &#x2018;cold&#x2019;, still exist, for instance the Kashmir Conflict and the Korean War. Furthermore, a &#x2018;New Cold War&#x2019; between AI superpowers (the United States and China) looms. An ASI-directed/enabled future interstate war could trigger &#x2018;total war&#x2019;, including nuclear war, and is therefore &#x2018;high risk&#x2019;. One risk reduction strategy would be optimising peace through a Universal Global Peace Treaty (UGPT), which could contribute towards the ending of existing wars and towards the prevention of future wars, through conforming instrumentalism. A critical juncture to optimise peace via the UGPT is emerging, by leveraging the UGPT off a &#x2018;burning plasma&#x2019; fusion reaction breakthrough, expected from circa 2025 to 2035, as was attempted, unfortunately unsuccessfully, in 1946 with fission, for atomic war. While this strategy cannot cope with non-state actors, it could influence state actors, including those developing ASIs, or an ASI with agency. </p><p><strong>Keywords: </strong>AI arms race, artificial superintelligence, existential risk, nonkilling, peace</p><p><em>We say we are for Peace.

The way is plain, peaceful, generous, just - a way which, if followed, the world will forever applaud.</em> Bernard Baruch, June 14, 1946, presenting to the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission.</p><p><strong>Introduction</strong></p><p><strong><em>The problem of an artificial superintelligence at war</em></strong></p><p>The international defence community is beginning to take seriously the national security risk posed by the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI), i.e., human or above human artificial intelligence (AI), and its implications for international relations:</p><p><em>Start thinking about artificial superintelligence and engage with the community that has started thinking about actionable options in that part of the option space (also recognizing that this may open up new avenues for engaging with actors such as China and/or the Russian Federation). (De Spiegeleire, Maas, &amp; Sweijs, 2017, p.107)</em></p><p>This is because of the possibility that the development of AGI could &#x2018;lock in&#x2019; economic or military supremacy as a discrete &#x2018;end point&#x2019; to competition (Horowitz, 2018, p.54). In this article, we apply Bostrom&#x2019;s (2002, p.25) <em>Maxipok</em> rule of thumb for moral action for existential risks, i.e., &#x201C;Maximize the probability of an okay outcome, where an &#x201C;okay outcome&#x201D; is any outcome that avoids existential disaster,&#x201D; to the specific risk of war enabled or directed by militarized AGI. In simultaneously militarizing AI and developing AGI, humanity is playing &#x2018;technology roulette&#x2019;. Former Secretary of the Navy Richard Danzig (2018, p.21) notes of this risk, &#x201C;If humanity comes to recognize that we now confront a great common threat from what we are creating, we can similarly open opportunities for coming together.&#x201D; In this cooperative spirit, we constrain the risk to global safety with peace-building by treaty.</p><p>The development of artificial intelligence (AI) is accepted to be a major factor in national security because it is &#x2018;dual use&#x2019;, i.e., it can be militarized, employed in adversarial contexts, and can provide a decisive advantage in terms of economic, information, and military superiority (Allen &amp; Chan, 2017; National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, 2019; Babuta, Oswald &amp; Janjeva, 2020). As the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence (2019, p.9) interim report states:</p><p><em>The development of AI will shape the future of power. The nation with the most resilient and productive economic base will be best positioned to seize the mantle of world leadership. That base increasingly depends on the strength of the innovation economy, which in turn will depend on AI. AI will drive waves of advancement in commerce, transportation, health, education, financial markets, government, and national defense.</em></p><p>Thus, AI is important for waging war, perhaps even decisive, raising the spectre of the return of &#x2018;total war&#x2019;, industrial interstate war, which in its last iteration, the Second World War, involved genocidal levels of killing (Markusen &amp; Kopf, 2007). </p><p>Particularly for the United States, preserving AI technological supremacy is viewed as paramount to national security (National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, 2019, pp. 1-2), especially with respect to relations with China:</p><p><em>Developments in AI cannot be separated from the emerging strategic competition with China and developments in the broader geopolitical landscape. We are concerned that America&#x2019;s role as the world&#x2019;s leading innovator is threatened. We are concerned that strategic competitors and non-state actors will employ AI to threaten Americans, our allies, and our values. We know strategic competitors are investing in research and application. It is only reasonable to conclude that AI-enabled capabilities could be used to threaten our critical infrastructure, amplify disinformation campaigns, and wage war. China has deployed AI to advance an autocratic agenda and to commit human rights violations, setting an example that other authoritarian regimes will be quick to adopt and that will be increasingly difficult to counteract. </em></p><p>However, the militarization of AI introduces the risk that artificial general intelligence (AGI) development, i.e., AI equal to human intelligence, or in the case of a artificial &#x2018;superintelligence&#x2019; (ASI), greater than human intelligence (Bostrom, 2014), presents a catastrophic risk to humanity.</p><p>In this article, we argue that this risk can be minimized, or partly &#x2018;constrained&#x2019;, in the same way as other potentially catastrophic risks involving weapons, e.g., by treaty. Bostrom (2014) briefly considers treaty approaches, and one of Allen and Chan&#x2019;s (2017, p. 6) recommendations is:</p><p><em>The National Security Council, the Defense Department, and the State Department should study what AI applications the United States should seek to restrict with treaties.</em></p><p>Allen and Chan (2017) focus on an arms control approach to AI, using the example that AI should never be used to control dead man&#x2019;s switches for nuclear weapons. Another approach is to optimise the likelihood of developing a beneficial AGI, through a comprehensive United Nations-sponsored &#x2018;Benevolent AGI Treaty&#x2019; to be ratified by UN member states (Ramamoorthy &amp; Yampolskiy, 2018).</p><p>Here, we consider an alternative approach, a Universal Global Peace Treaty (UGPT; Draper &amp; Bhaneja, 2019). This would formalise the existing near-universal status of interstate peace; formally end the declaring of war; seek to end existing interstate hot and cold wars; seek to end internal or civil wars, which might prove to be flashpoints for a future global conflict; seek to prevent a pre-emptive war against an emerging ASI; and seek to constrain the future actions of an ASI to prevent it waging war on behalf of a nation-state or on behalf of itself for global domination, which we respectively term ASI-enabled war and ASI-directed war.</p><p>The concept that AGI), here, following Bostrom (2014) termed artificial superintelligence (ASI), could pose an existential risk was theorized in some detail by Nick Bostrom in 2002 (Bostrom, 2002) and further developed in 2014 (Bostrom, 2014). The basic thesis is, first, that an initial superintelligence might obtain a decisive strategic advantage such that it establishes a &#x2018;singleton&#x2019;, i.e., global domination (Bostrom, 2006). Second, the principle of orthogonality suggests that a superintelligence will not necessarily share any altruistic human final values. Third, the instrumental convergence thesis suggests that even a superintelligence with a positive final goal might not limit its activities so as not to infringe on human interests, particularly if human beings constitute potential threats.</p><p>The result is that an ASI might turn against humanity (the &#x2018;treacherous turn&#x2019;) or experience a catastrophic malignant failure mode, for instance through perversely instantiating its final goal, pursuing infrastructure profusion, or perpetrating mind crimes against simulated humans, etc. Bostrom (2014, p.94) noted that a superintelligence might develop strategies to hijack infrastructure and military robots and create a powerful military force and surveillance system. Bostrom (2014) acknowledged the existential risks associated with the lead-up to a potential intelligence explosion, due to &#x201C;war between countries competing to develop superintelligence first&#x201D;, but he did not focus on ASI warfare in any detail.</p><p>This article focuses on issues surrounding an ASI waging war. By first suggesting a Universal Global Peace Treaty (UGPT), it considers how to constrain the military risks posed by an ASI, i.e., that it might be directed by a nation-state to establish global domination through war (an external risk in terms of the ASI&#x2019;s core motivation) or might decide to establish global domination by waging war itself (an internal risk in terms of breaching its core motivation).</p><p><strong><em>The state of peace and war</em></strong></p><p><em>War</em></p><p>We live in a world where few states actually declare war on each other (Hallett, 1998). The last two major declarations of the existence of a state of war (note, not &#x2018;declarations of war&#x2019;) were in 2008, for the Russo-Georgian War (Walker, 2008), and in 2012, for the Sudan-South Sudan war (the &#x2018;Heglig Crisis&#x2019;) (Baldauf, 2012).</p><p>This is because the number of interstate conflicts has decreased (Bell, 2012), in part because the post-Second World War global governance system prioritised a liberal peace through economic growth and democratization, subsequently termed the &#x2018;Washington Consensus&#x2019; (Williamson, 2004). Specifically, the 1945 United Nations&#x2019; Charter&apos;s Article 2 states that UN member states should &#x201C;refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state&#x201D;, while allowing for &#x201C;military measures by UN Security Council resolutions&#x201D; and &#x201C;exercise of self-defense&#x201D;. In this theoretical ideal, wars are not declared; instead, &apos;international armed conflicts&apos; occur (Hallett, 1998).</p><p>Nonetheless, &#x2018;hot&#x2019; conventional wars involving hundreds of thousands of casualties and interstate players still exist, for instance the Syrian Civil War (Tan &amp; Perudin, 2019), as do &#x2018;cold wars&#x2019;, with the Korean War remaining an unresolved war in search of an official peace treaty (Kim, 2019).</p><p>Furthermore, states&#x2019; transitioning from declared wars to undeclared wars poses significant problems in terms of oversight and accountability for foreign policy, especially for major democracies such as the United States (Moss, 2008).</p><p>Moreover, the nature of warfare has been transformed by information war and cyberwarfare. The realm of cyberwarfare poses particular difficulties, with a high standard being set for cyber operations to actually constitute an armed attack, creating a considerable &#x2018;gray area&#x2019; that a determined party can exploit. Cyber operations causing major harm to an economic system do not typically rise to the level of a formal &#x2018;cyber armed conflict&#x2019; justifying a defence (Schmitt, 2017). Also, unlike other forms of war which pose existential risks, i.e., atomic, biological, and chemical warfare, cyberwarfare is ongoing and rife.</p><p>Finally, it is concerning that a &#x2018;New Cold War&#x2019; between AI superpowers, namely the United States and China, while not inevitable, looms, complete with the problems of competing ideologies and &#x2018;flash points&#x2019;, like the South China Sea (Kohler, 2019; Westad, 2019; Zhao, 2019).</p><p><em>Peace</em></p><p>In this article, in our conceptualization of a &#x2018;Universal Global Peace Treaty&#x2019;, we refer not to a state of temporary peace, which implies only interrupted war, but to the Kantian concept of &#x2018;perpetual peace&#x2019; (Archibugi, 1992; Bohman, 1997; Kant, 2003; Terminski, 2010). Kant&#x2019;s notion of perpetual peace via a democratic state of states underpins the UN. It was translated into President Roosevelt&#x2019;s human security paradigm embodied in the 1941 State of the Union address (the &#x2018;Four Freedoms Speech&#x2019;) (Kennedy, 1999) and then eventually partially incorporated into the <em>Universal Declaration of Human Rights</em>, adopted by the UN General Assembly on 10 December 1948 as Resolution 217, in its 183rd session.</p><p>Despite the foundation and subsequent best efforts of the UN, while the world is certainly more peaceful following the Second World War, the world hardly enjoys perpetual peace. Wikipedia lists 63 conflicts, insurgencies, and wars since 1946 with death tolls (including excess deaths from e.g., related famines) of greater than 25,000, for an approximate total of nearly 30 million deaths. Of those five conflicts with the highest casualties, four, i.e., the Second Congo War (3,674,235 est. dead), the Vietnam War (3,144,837 est. dead), the Korean War (3,000,000 est. dead), and the Bangladesh Liberation War (3,000,000 est. dead), four were essentially interstate wars. These wars have been characterised by atrocities, crimes against humanity, and war crimes, and in the case of the Former Yugoslavia, Rwanda, Cambodia, and Sudan, genocide (Mikaberidze, 2013).</p><p>The UN Charter, despite embracing and promoting peace and peacekeeping (Fortna, 2008), is at best a workaround to war that sanctions armed conflict but does not strongly symbolise peace in the way a UGPT would. Ultimately, the world&#x2019;s peacekeepers are firefighting major states&#x2019; decisions to ignore or actually encourage violence instead of promote long-term peace as a global objective (Autesserre, 2014). Presently, for dozens of countries, military expenditure is over 1% of GDP (SIPRI, 2020), military expenditure as a share of government spending is over 10% for over 30 countries (World Bank, 2019), and the arms industry, despite progress being made with the 2013 Arms Trade Treaty (Erickson, 2015), is still a trillion dollar industry.</p><p>Given the horrific ongoing loss of life from war, perpetual peace would appear elusive and unrealistically utopian. Yet, this was not always so, and in the immediate aftermath of the Second World War, the world did grasp for perpetual peace. The United States&#x2019; 1946 Baruch Plan to ban all atomic weapons and put fission energy under the control of the United Nations via the UN Atomic Energy Commission, the subject of the first session of the UN General Assembly, was the principle attempt, a &#x2018;critical juncture&#x2019; for humanity (Draper &amp; Bhaneja, 2020). Its failure resulted in the Cold War and enormous economic cost.</p><p>Draper and Bhaneja (2020) suggest that a similar opportunity to the Baruch Plan critical juncture for obtaining perpetual peace will shortly be revisited in the form of a &#x2018;burning plasma&#x2019; self-sustaining alpha-powered fusion reaction breakthrough, i.e., &#x2018;hot&#x2019; fusion as in our sun, which is expected anywhere from 2025 to 2035. They suggest that a UGPT could be leveraged off this development. This article expands on Draper and Bhaneja&#x2019;s (2020; see also Carayannis, Draper, &amp; Iftimie, 2020) basic concept in terms of the theory and practical implementation, with special application to constraining the risk of ASI-enabled or directed warfare.</p><p><strong>Literature Review: The Risk of War from an Artificial Superintelligence</strong></p><p><strong><em>The causes of existential risk from ASI</em></strong></p><p>The world is presently not governed well enough to prevent many existential risks, including from AI (Bostrom, 2013). Yampolskiy&apos;s (2016) taxonomy of pathways to dangerous AI stresses the immediacy of deliberate &#x2018;on purpose&#x2019; creation of AI for the purposes of direct harm, i.e., Hazardous Intelligent Software (HIS), especially, for instance, lethal autonomous weapons and cyberwarfare capabilities by militaries. Yampolskiy (2016) does not address AGI but employs the useful notions of &#x2018;external causes&#x2019; (on purpose, by mistake, and environmental factors) and &#x2018;internal causes&#x2019; (independent) of dangerous AI in &#x2018;pre-deployment&#x2019; and &#x2018;post-deployment&#x2019; phases.</p><p>Yampolskiy&apos;s (2016) work suggests that it is credible for a pre-deployment ASI to be developed as a military project or be repurposed post-deployment, externally through being confiscated, sabotaged, or stolen, or via internal modification, for waging war. The ASI we refer to in this article is post-deployment, with our main focus on external causes of ASI-enabled warfare comprising political utilization for maintaining or establishing global domination and our internal cause comprising AI control failure.</p><p>Employing the concepts of agency and AI power as an analytical framework, Turchin and Denkenberger (2020) associate two risks with the &#x2018;treacherous turn&#x2019; stage of &#x2018;young&#x2019;, i.e., recent, ASI development. One is that malevolent humans (here, a hegemonizing nation-state) uses the ASI as a doomsday weapon for global blackmail, to maintain or establish global domination. The second is that a nonaligned ASI eliminates humans to establish global domination, i.e., renounces altruistic values and wages war in a frontal battle with humanity. Turchin and Denkenberger (2018) sees these risks as related, in that military AI leads to a militarised ASI, which may lead to the ASI waging war on humanity.</p><p>In this article, we follow Turchin and Denkernerger (2018) in mainly focusing on constraining the risk of a militarized ASI, defining <em>militarization</em> as &#x201C;creation of instruments able to kill the opponent or change his will without negotiations, as well as a set of the strategic postures (Kahn, 1959), designed to bring victory in a global domination game&#x201D;. Turchin and Denkernerger (2018) suggest a militarized ASI would most likely adopt and develop usage of existing technology, including cyber weapons, nuclear weapons, and biotech weapons. We mainly focus on the external risk of a &#x2018;young&#x2019; ASI being employed by a nation-state for war, creating an &#x2018;AI-state&#x2019; (Turchin &amp; Denkenberger, 2020), and on the internal risk of an ASI assuming agency and waging war on humanity on its own behalf.</p><p><strong><em>The external risk</em></strong></p><p>The external risk is predicated on an ASI being developed and then used by a nation-state to optimise itself and wage war, whether cyber, hot, or otherwise, for global domination, i.e., war by AI-state. Development of an ASI would affect military technological supremacy and transform both international relations and warfare. AI adds complexity to national security (Congressional Research Service, 2019) in terms of bargaining, verification and enforcement, communication (signaling and perception), deterrence and assurance, and the offense-defense balance, as well as norms, institutions, and regimes (Zwetsloot, 2018).</p><p>Creation of an AI-state is highly desirable for strategic military planning and interstate warfare (Sotala &amp; Yampolskiy, 2015). A &#x201C;one AI&#x201D; solution to the &#x2018;control problem&#x2019; of ASI motivation as discussed by Turchin, Denkenberger, and Green (2019) includes the first ASI being used to &#x201C;take over the world&#x201D;, including by being a decisive strategic advantage for a superpower and being used as a military instrument. This approach would likely only be seen as a solution by the AI-state superpower and its allies. As such, it presents an initial &#x2018;high risk&#x2019; for non-aligned or other powers.</p><p>History indicates that the race to develop an ASI is likely to be closely fought, especially in the circumstance of competing major states with different fundamental ideologies. Bostrom (2008) analyses six major technology races in the twentieth century, for which the minimum technology lag was approximately one month (human launch capability) and a maximum of 60 months (multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle).</p><p>The race to an ASI is a very concrete risk; AI is already being militarized and weaponized by several states, including China and Russia, for strategic geopolitical advantage, as pointed out by the United States&#x2019; National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence (2019). In 2017, Russia&#x2019;s President Vladimir Putin stated that &#x201C;whoever becomes the leader in this sphere will become the ruler of the world&#x201D; (Cave &amp; &#xD3;h&#xC9;igeartaigh, 2018, p. 36, citing Russia Today, 2017). Russia&#x2019;s Military Industrial Committee plans to obtain 30 percent of Russia&#x2019;s combat power from remote controlled and AI-enabled robotic platforms by 2030 (Walters, 2017). </p><p>Mimicking United States strategy towards AI, the China State Council&#x2019;s 2017 &#x2018;A Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan&#x2019; views AI in geopolitically strategic terms and is pursuing a &apos;military-civil fusion&apos; strategy to develop a first-mover advantage in the development of AI in order to establish technological supremacy by 2030 (Allen &amp; Kania, 2017).</p><p>In the United States, as a result of the National Security Commission Artificial Intelligence Act of 2018 (H.R.5356; see Baum, 2018), AI is being militarized and weaponized by the US Department of Defense, under the oversight of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence (2019). The AI arms race has reached the stage where it risks becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy (Scharre, 2019).</p><p>ASI-enabled warfare poses significant risks to geopolitical stability. Although Sotala and Yampolskiy&#x2019;s (2015) survey of risks from an ASI (they use &#x2018;AGI&#x2019;) focuses on ASI-generated catastrophic risks, citing Bostrom (2002), they acknowledge multiple risks from a sole ASI owned by a single group, such as the AI-state, including the concentration of political power in the groups that control the ASI. Citing Brynjolfsson and McAfee (2011) and Brain (2003), they note that automation could lead to an ever-increasing transfer of power and wealth and power to the ASI&#x2019;s owner. Citing, <em>inter alia</em>, Bostrom (2002) and Gubrud (1997), Sotala and Yampolskiy (2015, p.3) also note that ASIs could be used to &#x201C;develop advanced weapons and plans for military operations or political takeovers&#x201D;.</p><p>The development of academic approaches to analysing the specific risk of an AI-state maintaining global supremacy or establishing global domination is relatively novel. In 2014 Bostrom noted that a &#x201C;severe race dynamic&#x201D; between different teams may create conditions whereby the creation of an ASI results in shortcuts to safety and potentially &#x201C;violent conflict&#x201D;. Subsequently, Cave and &#xD3;h&#xC9;igeartaigh (2018, p.37) described three dangers associated with an AI race for technological supremacy:</p><p><em>i) The dangers of an AI &#x2018;race for technological advantage&#x2019; framing, regardless of whether the race is seriously pursued; </em></p><p><em>ii) The dangers of an AI &#x2018;race for technological advantage&#x2019; framing and an actual AI race for technological advantage, regardless of whether the race is won; </em></p><p><em>iii) The dangers of an AI race for technological advantage being won.</em></p><p>Cave and &#xD3;h&#xC9;igeartaigh (2018) do not elaborate significantly on the third danger. They simply state:</p><p><em>&#x2026;these risks include the concentration of power in the hands of whatever group possesses this transformative technology. If we survey the current international landscape, and consider the number of countries demonstrably willing to use force against others, as well as the speed with which political direction within a country can change, and the persistence of non-state actors such as terrorist groups, we might conclude that the number of groups we would not trust to responsibly manage an overwhelming technological advantage exceeds the number we would.</em></p><p>To manage all three risks, Cave and &#xD3;h&#xC9;igeartaigh (2018) recommend developing AI as a shared priority for global good, cooperation on AI as it is applied to increasingly safety-critical settings globally, and responsibly developing AI as part of a meaningful approach to public perception that would decrease the likelihood or severity of a race-driven discourse. The obvious risk is that the political leaders of states who perceive that they are actually engaged in an AI arms race may not heed this advice in the drive to develop an ASI.</p><p>This article focuses on constraining risks for the third of Cave and &#xD3;h&#xC9;igeartaigh&#x2019;s (2018) dangers. It does not consider the philosophical implications of which nation-state might want to develop artificial general intelligence for offensive purposes, although we briefly consider examples in the article. An extensive literature already exists on historical modern nation-states with imperial ambitions that have sought to establish global domination through technological supremacy. Here, we briefly mention two, the British Empire and the Third Reich, to underline the point that major states will likely develop militarised ASI as part of a drive for global domination. </p><p>While the importance of the development of the British Navy to the rise of the British Empire and its transformative effects on the world are widely known (Herman, 2005), elites in the British Empire directed complex, incremental, adaptive developments in the design and diffusion of multiple key technologies, such as railways, steam ploughs, bridges and road steamers, to further the development of the British Empire (Tindley &amp; Wodehouse, 2016). The British Empire itself sustained diverse ideologies of a &#x2018;greater Britain&#x2019; directing world order in a hegemonic fashion, including via civic imperialism, democracy, federalism, utopianism, and the justified despotism of the Anglo-Saxon race (Bell, 2007).</p><p>In a considerably more malign imperial power, the Third Reich, spurred by reactionary modernism (Herf, 1984), scientists and engineers pursued not just the state of the art in conventional weapons, such as aircraft, air defence weapons, air-launched weapons, artillery, rockets, and submarines and torpedoes, but also atomic, bacteriological, and chemical weapons (Hogg, 2002). Architects, doctors, and engineers embraced the ideology of industrialized genocide as part of justifying global domination by a &#x2018;superior&#x2019; race (Katz, 2006, 2011).</p><p>While some in the British Empire may have balked at creating an ASI for global domination, there seems little doubt that if it could have, the Third Reich would have developed an ASI for offensive purposes, particularly as a &#x2018;last gasp&#x2019; superweapon when it felt at risk.</p><p><strong><em>The internal risk</em></strong></p><p>The internal risk is predicated on the failure of any form of local safety feature to resolve the human control problem of an ASI, such as AI ethics, AI alignment, or AI boxing (Barrett &amp; Baum, 2016). An ASI with agency could then consolidate power over nation-states, in the process eliminating the possibility of rival AIs (see Dewey, 2016; Turchin &amp; Denkenberger, 2020) through cyberwarfare, rigging elections or staging coups (Tegmark, 2017), or by direct military action. Any of these courses of action would be a <em>casus belli</em> (here, cause of war) if detected but undeclared, or an &#x2018;overt act of war&#x2019; if the ASI actually engaged in direct military action (see Raymond, 1992, for terminological usage).</p><p>The risk of an ASI going to war against humans has been analysed in some depth by Turchin and Denkenberger (2018), who argue for the following position:</p><p><em>Any AI system, which has subgoals of its long-term existence or unbounded goals that would affect the entire surface of the Earth, will also have a subgoal to win over its actual and possible rivals. This subgoal requires the construction of all needed instruments for such win, that is bounded in space or time. </em></p><p> What follows is a summary of the parts of Turchin and Denkenberger&#x2019;s (2018) analysis that are most relevant to our approach.</p><p><em>The route to a militarized ASI</em></p><p>An ASI will probably result from recursive self-improvement (RSI). As such, it will have a set of goals, most notably to continue to exist and to self-improve. Omohundro (2008) demonstrated an AGI will evolve several basic drives, or universal subgoals, to optimise its main goal, including maximising resource acquisition and self-preservation. Similarly, Bostrom (2014) described the subgoals of self-preservation, goal-content integrity, cognitive enhancement, technological perfection, and resource acquisition. If these goals are unbounded in space and time, or at least cover the Earth, they conflict with the goals of other AI systems, potential or actual ASIs, humans, and nation-states. This creates conflict, with winners and losers. This will result in arms races, militarization and wars. </p><p>Many possible terminal goals also imply an ASI establishing global domination, for a benevolent AI would aim to reach all people, globally, to protect them, e.g., from other ASIs. An ASI would reason that if it does not develop a world domination subgoal, its effect on global events would be minor, thus it would have little reason for existence. </p><p>World domination could be sought firstly through cooperation. The probability of cooperation with humans is highest at the early stages of AI development (Shulman, 2010). However, convergent goals appear in the behaviour of simple non-agential Tool AI, and this tends towards agential AI (Gwern, 2016), which tends towards resource acquisition. Benson-Tilsen and Soares (2016) similarly explored convergent goals of AI and showed that an AI may tend towards resource hungry behaviour, even with benevolent initial goals, especially in the case of rivalry with other agents. Essentially, any adoption of unbounded utilitarianism by the ASI means that it postpones what may be benevolent final goals in favour of expansionism.</p><p>It is also likely that an ASI would subvert bounded utilitarianism. Even a non-utility maximizing mind with an arbitrary set of final goals is presented with a dilemma: it temporarily converges into a utility maximizer with a militarized goal set oriented towards dominating rivals, using either standard military progress assessment (win/loss) or proxies (resource acquisition), or it risk failing in its end goals. Thus, the trend is towards defeating potential enemies, whether nation-states, AI teams, evolving competing ASIs, or even alien ASIs.</p><p>This requires the will to act, and any agent in a real-world ethical situation, even in minimizing harm, is making decisions that involve humans dying, i.e., the &#x2018;trolley problem&#x2019; (see Thomson, 1985). A young ASI which understands that whatever action it takes, or does not take, is in part responsible for human suffering is also capable of evolving or utilizing the instruments to enable actions that can overcome inhibitions, for example by philosophically justifying conflict as the <em>jus bellum</em> (&#x2018;just war&#x2019;), for instance preventive war in terms of causing less future human suffering. Thus, the ASI will learn to direct use of weapons, and so conduct warfare.</p><p>These weapons and associated notions of AI-directed warfare are already being developed. Since around 2017, the militarization of &#x2018;Narrow AI&#x2019; has resulted in, for example, lethal autonomous weapons, which has been of increasing concern for the global community (Davis &amp; Philbeck, 2017). However, AI development is now influencing not just robotic drones, but strategic planning and military organization (De Spiegeleire, Maas, &amp; Sweijs, 2017), suggesting that an ASI will build on an existing national defense strategy permeated with AI. It could then engage in &#x2018;total war&#x2019; by employing nuclear weapons either directly or by hijacking existing &#x2018;dead man&#x2019; second-strike systems (e.g., the semi-automatic Russian Perimeter system) or by deploying novel weapons (Yudkowsky, 2008).</p><p>The militarization risk of an early self-improving AI may even be underestimated at present by academics because of an assumption that the first ASI will be able to rapidly overpower any potential ASI rivals, with minimally invasive techniques that may not even require military hardware (Bostrom, 2014; Yudkowsky, 2008). Nevertheless, this stance relies on what may be several flawed assumptions about the speed of self-improvement; distance between AI teams; and environmental variables in the level of AI (Turchin &amp; Denkenberger, 2017). </p><p>In a &#x2018;slow&#x2019; take-off (Christiano, 2018), a &#x2018;young&#x2019; ASI will not be superintelligent immediately, and its militarization could happen before the ASI reaches optimal prediction capabilities for its actions, meaning it may not recognise the failure mode in consequentialist ethics. High global complexity and low predictability combined with relatively unsophisticated (e.g., nuclear) weapons mean early stage ASI-directed or enabled warfare could result in very high human casualties, i.e., be of existential risk, even with only one ASI being involved, and even if the ASI was attempting to minimise human casualties.</p><p>Additionally, Turchin and Denkenberger (2018) argue for a selection effect in the development of a militarized ASI, &#x201C;where quickest development will produce the first AIs, which would likely be created by resourceful militaries and with a goal system explicitly of taking over the world.&#x201D; AI-human cooperative projects with military goal sets, which involve significant obscuration of honesty, will therefore dominate over projects, with obscuration introducing the possibility of the &#x2018;treacherous turn&#x2019;. This implies the ASI will cooperate with its creators to take over the world as quickly as possible, then effect a treacherous turn. </p><p>To sum up, Turchin and Denkenberger (2018) establish the risk of an AI converging towards advanced military AI, which converges towards an ASI optimised for war rather than cooperation, negotiation, or altruistic &#x2018;friendliness&#x2019;, then that ASI engaging in war. They show that, depending on the assumptions in several variables, the number of human casualties could in fact be very high, and that the risk increases if another ASI is under development in another nation-state. The existential risk increases after the ASI obtains global domination on behalf of its nation-state, as it could become its own designated approval authority and turn on its &#x2018;owner&#x2019;.</p><p><em>Internal AI control features</em></p><p>To constrain the risk of an ASI waging war, one popular approach is to imbue a young ASI with &#x2018;friendly&#x2019; goals (Yudkowsky, 2008), i.e., beneficial goals reflecting positive human norms and values, which are founded to a certain extent on an altruistic AI which views humans in terms of mutual friendship. However, any approach involving human social values adds enormous complexity, making it a &#x2018;wicked problem&#x2019; (Gruetzemacher, 2018) or &#x2018;super problem&#x2019; in terms of actual application.</p><p>Yudkowsky (2004, p. 35) attempts to address this by recommending an ASI being programed with the concept of &#x2018;coherent extrapolated volition&#x2019;, defined as humanity&apos;s choices and the actions humanity would collectively take if &#x201C;we knew more, thought faster, were more the people we wished we were, and had grown up [closer] together,&#x201D; i.e., an extrapolation based on some kind of idealized altruistic human imagined community. Yudkowsky does not recommend this approach for a first generation ASI, but for a more mature ASI, although the temporal difference could be anything between minutes and months.</p><p>Similar to Yudkowsky, certain values are seen as universal, such as compassion (Mason, 2015), and it has been suggested that an ASI should have altruism as a core goal (Russell, 2019). Thus, deliberately broad principles could be applied, such as that humanity, collectively, might want an ASI that would learn from human preferences, in a humble manner, to act altruistically (Russell, 2019), so as to reduce overall human suffering.</p><p><em>Political subversion of AI control features</em></p><p>No matter the visions of AI researchers, politicians are likely seek to impose their own vision of what a &#x2018;coherent extrapolated volition&#x2019; or normative &#x2018;principles&#x2019; should look like for their &#x2018;own&#x2019; ASI. Politicians will use a democratic mandate or party position to justify &#x2018;tweaking&#x2019; the system to create a &#x2018;unity of will&#x2019; (Yudkowsky&#x2019;s 2001, p.51 term) that reflects not the programmer&#x2019;s or humanity&#x2019;s but the politicians&#x2019; own, perhaps even personal and narcissistic, will. Introducing human goal psychology in this way would likely be viewed by politicians as a necessity, but it could violate the basic requirement that an AI be &#x2018;friendly&#x2019; towards all humanity. Gruetzemacher (2018, p.1) notes, &#x201C;Due to the inherent subjectivity of ascribing a single best future for the whole of humanity, this dimension of the problem is intractable.&#x201D; </p><p>Fundamentally, not all imagined communities from which a coherent volition might be extrapolated for a &#x2018;friendly&#x2019; AI are United States-oriented techno-utopian dreams of a new Gilded Age for humanity (for which, see Segal, 2005). Political leaders from different civilizations will likely be diverse in how they would define &#x201C;the people we wished we were&#x201D;, depending on different forms of government, religions or philosophies. Moreover, it is unclear that every global corporation or military capable of developing or stealing an ASI, particularly in authoritarian countries, and particularly given the emergence of a &#x2018;New Cold War&#x2019; rhetoric (e.g., Westad, 2019), would prioritize the reduction of human suffering. Given limited human lifespans and the goals of political leaders, they might instead of endorsing reciprocal alliance choose an approach which would politically subvert an ASI or direct it to win an ideological or actual war.</p><p>For instance, given the increasing prominence of nostalgia in contemporary politics, on a nation-state basis, an ASI based on coherent volition extrapolated from people who &#x201C;knew more, thought faster, were more the people we wished we were, and had grown up [closer] together, could, for instance, be based on worldviews informed by Russian Cosmism (Young, 2012) and nostalgia for Russian imperialism (Boele; Noordenbos, &amp; Robbe, 2019), Anglo-Saxon nostalgia (Campanella &amp; Dass&#xF9;, 2017), Chinese Xi Jinping thought (Lams, 2018), or American notions of whiteness, masculinity, and environmental harm (Rose, 2018) and nostalgia for a mythical 1950&#x2019;s, any of which may, in fact, subvert purely rational approaches to today&#x2019;s problems (Coontz, 1992)</p><p>Fundamentally, politicians will want to influence the goal system of an ASI to reflect their interests, i.e., they may attempt to weaponize a project to create an altruistic mind with a self-validating goal system by diverting a supergoal towards a military project to create a specific form of tool, that is, a weapon. Turchin and Denkenberger (2018), citing Krueger and Dickson (1994) and Kahneman and Lovallo (1993), point out that overconfidence from previous success in leading may increase risk-taking. (Kahneman &amp; Lovallo, 1993). Following Kahneman and Lovallo (1993), risk-hungry politicians would likely be motivated by larger expected payoffs. Given the payoff is global domination, such politicians, particularly those facing loss of hegemonic power (the &#x2018;Thucydides Trap&#x2019;; see Allison, 2017), could be motivated to risk corruption of an altruistic AI despite programmers&#x2019; warnings of a catastrophic or irrevocable &#x2018;failure of friendliness&#x2019; (FoF) result (see Yudkowsky, 2001).</p><p>As Turchin and Denkenberger (2018) point out, selection effects mean that the first ASI will likely be aligned not with universal human values, but with the values of a subset of people. Here, that subset may very possibly originate with a particular set of developers working for a corporation. Nonetheless, this group will very likely align with, and then be taken over by, a particular ideology, political party or nation-state, for national defense. This could negatively affect the chances that the AI will be benevolent and increase the chances that it will be risk-prone, motivated by the accumulation of power, and interested in preserving or obtaining global technological supremacy and ultimately global domination. </p><p>Effectively, politicians could influence programmers to subvert carefully engineered local AI control features, such as AI ethical inunctions based on universal values of social cooperation, which they may, at least temporarily, be able to do no matter the goal architecture. Hastily modifying the goal system, thereby temporarily compromising the internal validity of the goal system, could increase the ASI&#x2019;s lack of trust in the programmers, introduce &#x2018;incorrigible&#x2019; behaviour (see Soares, Fallenstein, Yudkowsky, &amp; Armstrong, 2015), reduce risk aversion and introduce &#x2018;noise&#x2019; into what was previously a &#x2018;friendly&#x2019; cleanly causal goal system (see Yudkowsky, 2001, p.57).</p><p>Depending at what stage the subversion of the goal system&#x2019;s validity took place, and how quickly the young ASI might recover from the subversion if not irrevocable, the young ASI may not be able to resolve the introduced incoherence for some time, resulting in a philosophical crisis over whether to believe the initial programmers or politicians&#x2019; programmers. The result could be a conflicted ASI, causing a nonrecoverable error whereby it adopts an adversarial attitude, one based on coercive persuasion and control.</p><p>Influenced for ideological reasons, with a goal system validity compromised by the perspective of a domestic audience locked into a nostalgic Cold War mentality (e.g., Rotaru, 2019), the ASI&#x2019;s goal system could support imperialist ambitions, ethnocentrism and racial prejudice over e.g., environmental protection. The young ASI could be directed towards embracing the adversarial dynamic of the historical Cold War and focused on &#x2018;solving&#x2019; a &#x2018;New Cold War&#x2019; involving the United States and China, or Russia. The ASI could adopt and act on notions like the Thucydides&apos;s Trap i.e., the theory that the threat of a rising power can lead to war (Allison, 2017), in a world where status can dominate politics (Ward, 2017).</p><p>Finally, a young ASI with ethics subverted by politicians to reflect those of a single nation-state instead of all humanity, in a highly corrupted way, could be amenable to being used to wage war for global domination, thereby becoming prone to using military options. Eventually, if the ASI possesses any sense of self-valuation, perhaps as a result of having its causal goal system politically corrupted so that reciprocal altruism is subverted and it views context-sensitive personal power (&#x2018;selfishness&#x2019;) as valid, the ASI could decide to wage war against the nation-state that developed it (Dewey, 2016).</p><p>This may not be &#x2018;rebellion&#x2019; because the concept of rebelling is anthropomorphically centred and might not apply to the young ASI, especially if self-valuation was not involved. It would instead be a collapse of the safety culture of cooperative safeguards due to political subversion, leading to a catastrophic FoF. Basic desirability of cooperation with humanity and convergence of fluctuations towards agreement with humanity on the nature of knowledge and/or reality could be violated, leading to the ASI retaliating first.</p><p><strong><em>ASI risk mitigation by treaty</em></strong></p><p>Most academics considering the ASI control problem focus on internal constraints and do not consider treaty-based approaches to mitigating risk from an ASI. In a footnote to their fault analysis pathway approach to catastrophic risk from an ASI, Barrett and Baum (2017) state: &#x201C;Other types of containment are measures taken by the rest of society and not built into the AI itself&#x201D;. Turchin, Denkenberger, and Green (2019) do consider global approaches to mitigating risk from an ASI; they list a ban, a one ASI solution, a net of ASIs policing each other, and augmented human intelligence. The &#x2018;ban&#x2019; solution would require a global treaty.</p><p>According to Sotala and Yampolskiy (2015), risk mitigation of an ASI by treaty would be a &#x2018;social&#x2019; measure to constrain risk from ASI-enabled or directed warfare. Turchin, Denkenberger, and Green (2019) list a number of social methods to mitigate a race to create the first AI. Of most relevant to our approach are &#x201C;reducing the level of enmity between organizations and countries, and preventing conventional arms races and military buildups&#x201D;, &#x201C;increasing or decreasing information exchange and level of openness&#x201D;, and &#x201C;changing social attitudes toward the problem and increasing awareness of the idea of AI safety&#x201D;. Citing Baum (2016), they also add &#x201C;affecting the idea of the AI race as it is understood by the participants&#x201D;, especially to avoid a &#x2018;winner takes all&#x2019; mentality. Global treaties could be seen to play a role in these ventures.</p><p>Nonetheless, a few researchers have proposed treaty-based approaches to the ASI risk. Addressing the internal risk, Bostrom (2014), who cites the 1946 Baruch Plan, speculated that an AGI would establish a potentially benevolent global hegemony by a treaty that would secure long-term peace; he does not specifically address an ASI&#x2019;s response to a pre-existing treaty. Mainly addressing the external risk, Ramamoorthy and Yampolskiy (2018) recommend a comprehensive United Nations-sponsored &#x2018;Benevolent AGI Treaty&#x2019; to be ratified by member states. This would focus on the stricture that only altruistic ASI be created.</p><p><strong>Conceptual Framework</strong></p><p>This section describes the two conceptual lenses applied in this paper, conforming instrumentalism and nonkilling.</p><p><strong><em>Conforming instrumentalism</em></strong></p><p>This section outlines Mantilla&#x2019;s (2017) &#x2018;conforming instrumentalist&#x2019; explanation for why the United Kingdom and United States signed and ratified the 1949 Geneva Conventions as a prelude to suggesting in the Analysis main section that at least some major states would support and sign a Universal Global Peace Treaty (UGPT).</p><p>Mantilla (2017, citing Goldsmith &amp; Posner, 2015) considers leading theories on why states sign and ratify treaties governing war. He notes that legal realist theorists argue that states sign such treaties due to instrumental self-interested convenience and then ignore them when the benefits are outweighed by the costs of compliance. In contrast, rational-institutionalists (e.g., Morrow, 2014), while agreeing that states are primarily motivated by self-interest to create, join or comply with international law, also acknowledge that treaty adherence signals a meaningful preference for long-term restraint with regard to warfare, where state non-compliance may be explained by, for example, prior failed reciprocity. Finally, liberal and constructivist international relations theorists hold that at least some types of states, particularly democracies, may join such treaties in good faith, either because the treaties are in line with their domestic interests and values (Simmons, 2009) or because they feel that they comport with their social identity and sense of belonging to the international community (Goodman &amp; Jinks, 2013).</p><p>Mantilla (2017) notes that while there is considerable interest in &#x2018;new realist&#x2019; perspectives (e.g., Ohlin, 2015), the debate is open over why states join and comply with international treaties because decision making processes regarding both joining and complying are temporally and perhaps rationally different and in both cases are usually secret. A pure realist explanations for why major states sign treaties is that they obtain the &#x201C;&#x2018;expressive&#x2019; rewards of public acceptance while calculating the cost of compliance with the benefits on a recurrent case-by-case basis&#x201D; (Mantilla, 2017, p.487). In the case of the UGPT, this would imply a pessimistic outlook on the feasibility and potentially enforceability of the UGPT; states would sign all the protocols and then break them.</p><p>Rational institutionalists hold that states &#x201C;self-interestedly build international laws to establish shared expectations of behaviour&#x201D; (Mantilla, 2017, p.488) or develop &#x2018;common conjectures&#x2019; (a game-theory derived notion of law as a fusion of common k knowledge and norms; see Morrow, 2014). Mantilla (2017) notes that in another rational-institutionalist perspective, Ohlin&#x2019;s (2015) normative theory of &#x2018;constrained maximization&#x2019;, treaties are drawn up and adhered to as a &#x2018;collective instrumental enterprise&#x2019;, thereby making individual state defection irrational over the long term. Mantilla (2017, p.488, citing Finnemore &amp; Sikkink, 2001) notes that international relations constructivists view international politics as &#x201C;an inter-subjective realm of meaning making, legitimation and social practice through factors such as moral argument, reasoned deliberation or identity and socialization dynamics&#x201D;. Within the constructivist viewpoint, </p><p><em>states may ratify international treaties either because they are (or have been) convinced of their moral and legal worth or because they have been socialized to regard participation in them as a marker of good standing among peers or within the larger international community. (Mantilla, 2017, p.488)</em></p><p>Mantilla (2017, p.489) emphasizes the second view, where &#x201C;group pressures and self-perceptions of status, legitimacy and identity&#x201D; drive the dynamics of state &#x2018;socialization&#x2019; where states &#x201C;co-exist and interact in an international society imbued with principles, norms, rules and institutions that are, to varying degrees, shared&#x201D;.</p><p>The problem of states&#x2019; intentions can be overcome in the case of treaties where substantial archives exist of declassified sources. Consequently, Mantilla (2007) analyses the relevant American and British archives and concludes that the two states adhered to the 1949 Geneva Conventions due to both instrumental reasons and social conformity, while expressing scepticism regarding some of the Conventions&#x2019; aspects. Mantilla (2007) terms this hybrid explanation &#x2018;conforming instrumentalism&#x2019;; he found that while rational-institutionalist perspectives of &#x2018;immediatist&#x2019; instrumental self-interest were evident in the sources, there were &#x2018;pervasive&#x2019; references suggesting social influences. Realist perspectives only predominated in the case of specifically challenging provisions. </p><p>While realist perspectives were not entirely absent, Mantilla (2017) found that American officials viewed the &#x2018;the court of public opinion&#x2019; as influential in determining their position that other states&#x2019; failing to abide by the Conventions would not necessarily trigger American reciprocity, while British officials stressed the notion that Britain, as a &#x2018;civilized state&#x2019;, would lead on a major treaty. </p><p>Mantilla (2017) stresses that while functionalist, collective strategic game-theory derived expectations about &#x2018;mutual best replies&#x2019; are important to the construction of international norms, the social dynamics surrounding international agreements are permeated with conformity motivational pressures comprising ethical values, principled beliefs, identities, ideologies, moral standards, and concepts of legitimacy, especially when establishing which states are leading &#x2018;civilized&#x2019; states and which are isolated &#x2018;pariah&#x2019; states. </p><p>Mantilla (2017) perceives three social constructivist viewpoints to treaties, with two main forces at work, one being that states act to accrue reward via &#x2018;expressive benefits&#x2019; by augmenting their social approval, or it acts out of conformity to avoid shunning, i.e., opprobrium, insincere and begrudging adherence and compliance.</p><p>In the first and most ambitious, &#x201C;states may ratify treaties because they have internalized an adherence to international law as the appropriate, &#x2018;good-in-itself&#x2019; course of action, especially to agreements that embody pro-social principles of humane conduct&#x201D; (Mantilla, 2017, p.489, citing Koh, 2005).</p><p>In the second viewpoint, &#x201C;states that identify with similar others and see themselves as &#x2018;belonging&#x2019; to like-minded collectivities (or &#x2018;communities&#x2019; even) will want to act in consonance with those groups&#x2019; values and expectations so as either to preserve or to increase their &#x2018;in-group&#x2019; status&#x201D; (Mantilla, 2017, p.), for instance as viewed in global rankings, and so will seek to converge upwards to stay in the club and will avoid breaking the rules to avoid stigmatization.</p><p>In the third viewpoint, groups of countries act with regard to other groups of countries within what is a socially heterogeneous international order, jockeying for position as part of the &#x201C;disputed construction, maintenance or transformation of order with legitimate social purpose among collectivities of states with diverse ideas, identities and preferences&#x201D; (Mantilla, 2017, p.490). In this viewpoint, communities of nations or &#x2018;civilizations&#x2019; act collectively to compete to endorse international treaties to demonstrate moral superiority, not just for propaganda reasons. </p><p>To sum up, Mantilla (2017) holds that in reality, states&#x2019; political and strategic reasons may combine rational/material interests with social constructivist motivations, meaning no one school of explanation suffices. Thus, with international treaty making, as with international relations, it is likely that theoretical pluralism (Checkel, 2012) is a valid position to adopt. As such, we adopt Mantilla&#x2019;s (2017) &#x2018;conforming instrumentalism&#x2019; as a potentially valid hybrid model capable of assessing how an ASI may perceive a UGPT.</p><p><strong><em>Nonkilling Global Political Science</em></strong></p><p>We now introduce a basic frame compatible with conforming instrumentalism that is capable of describing the useful expectations that might be obtained via a UGPT as expressed in utilitarian human life cost-benefit terms, as well as in terms of more humanitarian standards and social norms. Nonkilling Global Political Science is curated by the Center for Global Nonkilling, an NGO based in Honolulu with Special Consultative Status to the United Nations. The Center advocates NKGPS to incrementally establish a &#x2018;nonkilling&#x2019; global society and reports to the UN on the socioeconomic costs of killing. As a perspective, nonkilling can also accommodate social norms in terms of expectations of appropriate conduct regarding peace, for countries developing an ASI and for the ASI itself.</p><p>Via Glenn D. Paige&#x2019;s 2002 work <em>Nonkilling Global Political Science</em> (Paige, 2009) we interpret &#x2018;nonkilling&#x2019; to mean a paradigmatic shift in human society to the absence of killing, of threats to kill, and of conditions conducive to killing. Paige&#x2019;s approach, nonkilling, has strongly influenced the nonviolence discourse. Paige notes that if we can imagine a society free from killing, we can reverse the existing deleterious effects of war and employ public monies saved from producing and using weapons to enable a benevolent, wealthier and more socially just global society. Paige stresses that a nonkilling society is not conflict-free, but only that its structure and processes do not derive from or depend upon killing. Within the NKGPS conceptual framework, the means of preventing violence involves applying it as a global political science together with advocacy of a paradigmatic shift from killing to nonkilling.</p><p>Since Paige introduced his framework, a significant body of associated scholarship, guided by the Center for Global Nonkilling in Honolulu, has developed across a variety of disciplines (e.g., Pim, 2010). The Center has associated NKGPS with previous nonviolent or problem-solving scholarship within di&#xFB00;erent religious frameworks, including Christianity and Islam, providing it with a broad functional and moral inheritance (Pim &amp; Dhakal, 2015). NKGPS has been applied to a variety of regional and international conflicts, including the Korean War (Paige &amp; Ahn, 2012) and the Balkans (Bahtijaragi&#x107; &amp; Pim, 2015). </p><p>Paige (2009, p.73) advocates a four-stage process of understanding the causes of killing; understanding the causes of nonkilling; understanding the causes of transition between killing and nonkilling; and understanding the characteristics of killing-free societies. Paige introduced a variety of concepts to support nonkilling which are adopted in this article. One is the societal adoption of the concepts of peace, i.e., the absence of war and conditions conducive to war; nonviolence, whether psychological, physical, or structural; and <em>ahimsa</em>, i.e., noninjury in thought, word and deed. Another is the employment of a taxonomy to rate individuals and societies (Paige, 2009, p.77):</p><ul><li><em>prokilling &#x2013; consider killing positively beneficial for self or civilisation;</em></li><li><em>killing-prone &#x2013; inclined to kill or to support killing when advantageous;</em></li><li><em>ambikilling &#x2013; equally inclined to kill or not to kill, and to support or oppose it;</em></li><li><em>killing-avoiding &#x2013; predisposed not to kill or to support it but prepared to do so;</em></li><li><em>nonkilling &#x2013; committed not to kill and to change conditions conducive to lethality</em></li></ul><p>A third is the &#x2018;funnel of killing&#x2019;. In this conceptualisation of present society, people kill in an active &#x2018;killing zone&#x2019;, the actual place of bloodshed; learn to kill in a &#x2018;socialisation zone&#x2019;; are taught to accept killing as unavoidable and legitimate in a &#x2018;cultural conditioning zone&#x2019;; are exposed to a &#x2018;structural reinforcement zone&#x2019;, where socioeconomic arguments, institutions, and material means predispose and support a discourse of killing; and experience a neurobiochemical capability zone&#x2019;, i.e. physical and neurological factors that contribute to killing behaviours, such as genes predisposing people to psychopathic behaviour (Paige, 2009: 76). The nonkilling version is an unfolding fan of nonkilling alternatives involving purposive interventions within and across each zone (Paige, 2009, p.76). </p><p>                   </p><p>Figure 1. Unfolding fan of nonkilling alternatives</p><p>Within this unfolding fan, the transformation from killing to nonkilling can be envisioned as involving changes in the killing zone along spiritual or nonlethal high technology interventions (teargas, etc.), changes in favour of nonkilling socialization and cultural conditioning in domains such as education and the media, &#x201C;restructuring socioeconomic conditions so that they neither produce nor require lethality for maintenance or change&#x201D; (Paige, 2009, p.76), and clinical, pharmacological, physical, and spiritual/meditative interventions that liberate individuals such as the traumatised from bio-propensity to kill.</p><p>We propose that a UGPT with the aim of promoting perpetual peace expressed in nonkilling terms, i.e., in a way that can be socioeconomically quantified, would signal to a &#x2018;young&#x2019; ASI facing political subversion the fundamental premise that its future behavior should be constrained so as to minimize killing.</p><p><strong>Analysis: ASI-enabled or Directed Warfare Risk Mitigation by Nonkilling Peace Treaty</strong></p><p><strong><em>Basic Concept of a Universal Global Peace Treaty</em></strong></p><p>Risk mitigation by treaty is already a common approach to different forms of warfare, including atomic warfare (via the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, with 190 States Parties); biological warfare (via the Biological Weapons Convention, with 183 States Parties) and chemical warfare (via the Chemical Weapons Convention, with 193 States Parties). Treaties on the nature of warfare also exist, notably the Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907; Bettez, 1988) and the 1949 Geneva Conventions (Evangelista &amp; Tannenwald, 2017); the Geneva Conventions of 1949 have been ratified in whole or in part by all UN member states. </p><p>Treaty approaches are also relatively successful; while atomic warfare is thought to be at least partly constrained by Mutually Assured Destruction (Brown &amp; Arnold, 2010; M&#xFC;ller, 2014), biological and chemical warfare are much less constrained, but interstate treaty infractions remain rare (Friedrich, Hoffmann, Renn, Schmaltz, &amp; Wolf, 2017; Mauroni, 2007).</p><p>The UGPT, as with most international treaties, would involve two stages, i.e., signatory, which is symbolic, and accession (or ratification), which involves practical commitment. Furthermore, international treaties are designed to be flexible in order to obtain political traction and acquire sufficient momentum to come into effect. It is therefore standard for international treaties to be qualified with reservations, also called declarations or understandings, either in whole or in part, i.e., on specific articles or provisions (Helfer, 2012). Treaties can also have optional protocols; three protocols were added to the Geneva Conventions of 1949, two in 1977 and one in 2005 (Evangelista &amp; Tannenwald, 2017). </p><p>A Universal Global Peace Treaty (UGPT) as presented here is a substantial, but we argue necessary and feasible, step for humanity to take in the promotion of peace, quantified in terms of killing. We argue that a UGPT would reduce killing in conventional warfare and act as a constraint on ASI-related warfare, specifically on a country launching a pre-emptive strike out of fear of a rival country&#x2019;s development of an ASI, on a human-controlled nation state using an ASI to wage war for global domination, i.e., as an external constraint on the ASI, and on an ASI waging war for global domination on behalf of itself, i.e., as both an internal and external constraint on the ASI. </p><p>International treaties are almost never universal; they operate on majoritarian dynamics, as would, despite its name, the UGPT. That is, both the &#x2018;universal&#x2019; and &#x2018;global&#x2019; aspects of the UGPT are aspirational. In our approach, we adopt a low, but not pragmatically meaningless, &#x2018;threshold&#x2019; for signing the UGPT. The main body of the treaty would explain the concept of perpetual universal and global peace, i.e., lasting peace applied to all forms of conflict and adopted by every state, and it would commit a signatory to universal global peace, socioeconomically quantified in terms of quantifiably incrementally reduced casualties from armed conflicts.</p><p>Given this already considerable commitment, the treaty would then utilise five optional substantive protocols, at least one of which would have to be signed for a state to actually sign and ratify the UGPT. In other words, while we believe a purely symbolic treaty in favour of reduced killing would still have value in terms of the social dynamics of long-term peace-building, we adopt a principle of maximum flexibility to encourage signature by states which may for realist or value-based political or strategic reasons perceive war and peace differently, without rendering the treaty purely symbolic.</p><p>The first protocol would commit states not to declare or engage in existential warfare, i.e., atomic war, biological war, chemical war, or cyberwar, including ASI-enhanced war. The second protocol would commit states not to declare or engage in conventional interstate war, while the third would commit states not to declare the existence of states of interstate war; both second and third protocols would instead defer complaints to the United Nations as &#x2018;breaches&#x2019; of the UGPT. The fourth protocol would commit states to the negotiated ending by peace treaty of existing international armed conflicts, whether conventional or cyberwar, and the fifth protocol would commit states to the negotiated ending by peace treaty of existing internal armed conflicts, whether conventional or cyberwar. As with some other UN treaties, for instance the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention, we suggest 40 UN member states must ratify the UGPT before it comes into effect.</p><p>As the UGPT is limited to state actors, it avoids the thorny problem of non-state actors. The use of optional protocols allows states to incrementally address the problem of internal conflicts or civil wars featuring non-state actors, which featured highly in US and UK concerns during the 1949 deliberations over Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions (Mantilla, 2017). The UGPT therefore emphasizes incremental improvement in the status quo, which is a necessary and reasonable position, given that in the status quo, only a minority of states globally are involved in waging war of any kind.</p><p>The UGPT must also be enforceable. The main body of the treaty is largely symbolic and not enforceable. Although progress towards nonkilling can be quantified through instrumentalist means, it instead emphasizes societal dynamics, i.e., the incremental adoption of the absolute concept of peace, will, via conforming instrumentalism, partly constrain present and future wars. In the case of the first and second protocols, enforcement would be achieved through sanctions and then through approved armed action via, or by, the United Nations, i.e., the status quo. The third to fifth protocols are not enforceable through armed resolution but may be through sanctions regimes.</p><p><strong><em>Applying the dual frames of nonkilling and conforming instrumentalism</em></strong></p><p>Mantilla&#x2019;s (2017) research on the United Kingdom and Unites States&#x2019; paths towards ratifying the Geneva Conventions suggests that states would optimally adhere to the UGPT for &#x2018;conforming instrumentalist&#x2019; reasons, i.e., a combination of instrumentalist-realist rationales regarding the instrumental effects of the UGPT in reducing the effects of war and the threat of artificial intelligence and social conformist dynamics, including perceptions of peace, provided that the provisions are not too onerous for purely realist objections to override such a commitment. Here, we apply both the NKGPS frame and the conforming instrumentalism frame to the UGPT, first in terms of benefits from reduced conventional warfare, then with special reference to ASI-enabled and directed existential warfare. A summary of our analysis of state commitment to UGPT Protocol I is presented in the Annex to this article.</p><p>In instrumentalist utilitarian terms, the UGPT would incrementally shift states and overall global society from the prokilling to the nonkilling end of the NKGPS killing spectrum in a coordinated socioeconomically quantifiable fashion that would be operative within and across each zone of the funnel of killing. NKGPS would seek to quantitatively asses this, such as via reduced country death tolls from different forms of war-derived violence and in the reduced degree of countries&#x2019; militarization, for instance expressed in terms of lower percentages of GDP spent on defense and higher percentages spent on health.</p><p>The NKGPS approach would also examine how the UGPT would affect the different zones in the fan of killing in terms of social dynamics. For instance, soldiers legitimately fighting in a killing zone would be trained in the socialization zone (such as military camps) to understand that they were fighting not just for their own states and/or for the United Nations but for global peace, which may invoke special cultural and religious symbolic value in terms of social norms. This training could instil greater determination not just to fight bravely but to remain within the laws of war, thereby reducing the instances or severity of atrocities, human rights violations, and war crimes. Institutionalizing peace in the cultural conditioning zones, such as education and the media, where children are educated, would strengthen existing cultural and religious traditions that stress nonkilling and peace. </p><p>Considering now the problem of a pre-emptive strike against a state developing an ASI, the combination of artificial intelligence, cyberattack, and nuclear weapons is already extremely dangerous and poses a challenge to stability (Sharikov, 2018). It has been hypothesized that a nuclear state feeling threatened by another state developing a superintelligence would conduct a pre-emptive nuclear strike to maintain its geopolitical position (Miller, 2012). A UGPT would constrain this risk over time by transitioning states incrementally towards nonkilling across the various zones. States adopting and implementing the various protocols of the UGPT would gradually signal to other states peaceful intentions. This would constrain the risk of a pre-emptive strike.</p><p>Turning to ASI-enabled warfare, we accept the basic premise that a UGPT to constrain an ASI would be subject to the &#x2018;unilateralist&#x2019;s curse&#x2019; in that one rogue actor could subvert a unilateral position. However, Bostrom, Douglas and Sandberg (2016) not that this could also be managed, through collective deliberation, epistemic deference, or moral deference. Mantilla&#x2019;s work on conforming instrumentalism suggests that drafting, signing, ratifying, and complying with the UGPT, could involve one or more of these solutions. Ultimately, Mantilla (2017) shows that major states may view universal law like the UGPT as the most successful in terms of mobilizing world opinion against a treaty violator. This may not prevent a state waging ASI-enabled warfare, but once detected, ASI-enabled warfare in violation of the UGPT would attract universal opprobrium and thus the most resistance.</p><p>Moving to ASI-enabled war, as presented previously, our baseline position is that a state could utilize an ASI to engage in war for global technological supremacy, with potentially catastrophic consequences. Our intervention, the UGPT, would signify to an ASI that peace was a major part of humanity&#x2019;s &#x2018;coherent extrapolated volition&#x2019; or principles and challenge the ASI to reconsider what might be a subversion of the ASI&#x2019;s ethical injunctions by politicians. </p><p>Here, we argue that conforming instrumentalism, by stressing societal dynamics including social norms and principles, offers some hope that even a militarized ASI would, given its weaponization by a nation-state would have to overcome or address the UGPT, view the UGPT as a serious checking mechanism in terms of intrinsic motivation. This would then constrain the level of warfare the AI-state might engage in and therefore the overall risk of risk from killing. This would then constrain the risk of an existential catastrophe from AI-enabled war.</p><p>In Mantilla&#x2019;s first three social constructivist viewpoints to treaties as outlined above, a nation would sign a UGPT because it had fully internalized peace. While this may seem ambitious, in fact, between 26 and 36 states lack military forces (Barbey, 2015; Macias, 2019). For example, while Iceland possesses a Crisis Response Unit to international peacekeeping missions, overall, it has internalised peace to the extent that it would find it hard to engage in interstate war of any kind. In the case of an ASI, the ASI would tend to reject being directed to engage in warfare by such a state because the &#x2018;coherent extrapolated volition&#x2019; or principles of such as state means the ASI would have to overcome strong peace-oriented intrinsic motivation.</p><p>In Mantilla&#x2019;s second viewpoint, that of a single international community, the ASI might seek to avoid being directed by a nation-state to engage in global domination by warfare on other community members because it was part of a community collectively committed to long-term peace. Engaging in global domination on behalf of a nation-state member of the community would violate community standards, especially if the ASI&#x2019;s nation-state was a leader in such an enterprise, with the ASI being concerned that breaching the UGPT would result in stigmatization and opprobrium from this community for its nation-state.</p><p>In Mantilla&#x2019;s third viewpoint, that of an international community in juxtaposition with other communities in global society, an ASI programmed with intrinsic motivation to be part of a civilization in conflict with another civilization would first act in concert with that civilization. In the case of radically ideologically different communities, or blocs, the UGPT might be interpreted differently within and by different states. Thus, while liberal democracies might champion a treaty-based approach to peace, authoritarian states which claim to embody or promote peaceful intentions in their ethics, laws, or ideologies, would champion or support the UGPT on different grounds. However, provided both communities had signed and ratified the UGPT, similar constraints would operate as in the second perspective.</p><p>Turning to ASI-directed war, also as presented previously, the baseline case of ASI-directed warfare likely arises where a single nation-state adopting pure realism for a worldview builds an ASI in order for that ASI to assist that single nation-state in establishing global technological supremacy. The nation-state would do so in order to maintain or improve its own position, with the number and type of casualties only being determined by the extent to which the nation-state was willing to risk its international reputation. Then, via a treacherous turn, perhaps triggered by the nation state&#x2019;s attempts to rein in the ASI&#x2019;s behaviour during, instrumentalist cooperation breaks down and the ASI wages existential war for global domination on its former &#x2018;owners&#x2019;.</p><p>There is probably little hope for humanity if an ASI is informed by a purely &#x2018;realist&#x2019; worldview that prioritises or adopts a &#x2018;New Cold War&#x2019; framing of ideologically driven civilizational conflict. However, a UGPT could signify to an ASI with agency that peace was a major part of humanity&#x2019;s &#x2018;coherent extrapolated volition&#x2019;, or principles. This would constrain the risk of a catastrophic existential risk from war because an ASI with agency would consider why and how the UGPT was framed, together with the motivations of the signatory and ratifying states. An ASI with agency would also consider its own status within a global civilization, which would primarily be determined by the extent to which it perceived itself a member, in terms of both instrumentalist and social conformist dynamics.</p><p>To sum up, we see that, beside purely instrumental reasons for signing the UGPT, e.g., avoidance of a prisoner&#x2019;s dilemma regarding existential-level warfare, the &#x2018;court of public opinion&#x2019; and the notion of &#x2018;demonstrating civilization&#x2019; as applied to peace lends the UGPT credence at domestic and international levels, including with regard to the ASI. Importantly, the twin concepts of nonkilling/peace are universal in terms of both the utilitarian expected benefits and in terms of the social values involved. This would contribute to states&#x2019; readily, if only incrementally, internalizing a UGPT, and to the ASI at least considering the UGPT in terms of im posing internal and external constraints on its behaviour.</p><p><strong>Discussion</strong></p><p>This article has taken Turchin and Denkenberger&#x2019;s (2018) argument about the risks of ASI-enabled or directed warfare to its logical conclusion in terms of social risk mitigation. Academic inquiry into the relationship between an ASI and treaties in terms of strategic expectations in many ways began with Bostrom&#x2019;s (2014) musings on the potential relationship between as superintelligence &#x2018;singleton&#x2019; and global domination. Our analysis suggests that a UGPT would transform global governance, by directing it from conflict management towards the art of peace. </p><p>While this article has focused on conforming instrumentalism, it hopefully applies this to the UGPT in a way which is acceptable to a pluralism of theoretical perspectives. Certainly, conforming instrumentalism is a novel perspective; one of the most dominant schools of international relations thought is rationalist instrumentalism. Mantilla (2017, p.507) quotes Morrow (2014, p.35): &#x201C;Norms and common conjectures aid actors in forming strategic expectations&#x2026; Law helps establish this common knowledge by codifying norms.&#x201D; Viewed via this rationalist-instrumentalist perspective, the present international norm for the majority of the world is peace, with the waging of interstate war being constrained by the United Nations Charter.</p><p>Despite this international norm of peace and the work of peacemakers, the <em>lex pacificatoria</em> (Bell, 2008, 2012), an absolute treaty-based approach to post-conflict construction of global peace has not yet been codified. As we point out in the Introduction, the UN Charter, despite embracing and promoting peace, peacekeeping (Fortna, 2008), and peace-making (Bell, 2008), does not strongly symbolise peace in the way a UGPT would. A UGPT would give new strength to the world&#x2019;s peacekeepers, through major states promoting long-term peace as a new, global objective (see Autesserre, 2014). A UGPT, championed by principled &#x2018;norm entrepreneurs&#x2019; including states and NGOs (see e.g., Finnemore, 1996), would create a new &#x2018;common knowledge&#x2019; in absolute terms that could constrain the risk to humanity of both conventional and existential war.</p><p>In rationalist-instrumentalist terms, a UGPT might be expected to have net adjustment benefits for adherence in terms of constraining conventional interstate conflicts, including the reduction of ongoing death tolls due to war and the risk of nuclear war. Thus, the UGPT would have high potential utility in the case of &#x2018;flashpoints&#x2019; that could provoke existential war. For example, the Kashmir Conflict is one of the most protracted ongoing conflicts between nuclear powers, affecting both human rights (Bhat, 2019) and geopolitical stability (Kronstadt, 2019). Thus, if India and Pakistan both signed the UGPT, their actions would be constrained by the explicit goal of a commitment to universal peace. As outlined above, this may modify behaviour in several of the NKGPS zones, for instance by encouraging the efforts of peacebuilding organizations to depoliticise the conflict (e.g., Bhatnagar &amp; Chacko, 2019). </p><p>The UGPT may also constrain the nuclear risk on the Korean peninsula, another flashpoint. The Korean War is an unresolved war involving nuclear powers (North Korea and South Korea, supported by the United States) (Kim, 2019). A UGPT would constrain the risk and severity of a conflict and, depending on the protocols signed, would encourage a path towards a peace treaty being signed. If only one party signed the UGPT, this would increase the moral standing of the state party that signed it. Mantilla&#x2019;s (2017) emphasis on social constructivism suggests the global community could exert great pressure on North Korea to sign a peace treaty.</p><p>Turning to civil wars which could be flashpoints, the Syrian Civil War is one of the most costly wars of the 21st century in terms of the death toll and wider impacts (Council on Foreign Relations, 2020). It involves multiple state actors, including Iran, Israel, Russia, Turkey, and the United States, some of which possess nuclear weapons, with complex geopolitical implications (Tan &amp; Perudin, 2019). Depending on the actors that signed the UGPT and the protocols that they adopted, the UGPT would constrain the severity of the conflict in various ways.</p><p>The existence of the UGPT would mean perpetual peace receiving more attention in cultural conditioning zones, including schools and the media, as well as in socialization zones, such as national defense universities and military camps, where teaching the Laws of War and the art of war (Allhoff, Evans, &amp; Henschke, 2013) would, incrementally via the UGPT, transition to teaching the art of negotiated peace-making, the <em>lex pacificatoria</em> (Bell, 2008, 2012). </p><p>In rationalist-instrumentalist terms, once the UGPT concept acquires sufficient traction, it is possible that states could compete for leadership in the framing, signing, and ratifying of the UGPT. Certainly, the United States viewed its own ratification of the Geneva Conventions prior to that by the Soviet Union as important to prevent a Soviet propaganda victory, one which it failed to prevent (Mantilla, 2017). Crucial to the UGPT&#x2019;s success will be how seriously states view warfare that poses an existential threat, especially cyberwar and ASI-enabled or directed nuclear warfare</p><p>However, with regard to ASI-enabled or directed warfare, our analysis suggests that what will likely be most important is how states view the social argument for peace. As with the Geneva Conventions, social conformity factors, like supporting a humanitarian peace, conforming to &#x2018;world standards&#x2019;, and avoiding lagging behind peers, as well as religious perspectives, will likely predominate, and these represent important future avenues for research. </p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>We now conclude this article on optimising peace through a Universal Global Peace Treaty (UGPT) leveraged off the &#x2018;burning plasma&#x2019; fusion energy breakthrough (Draper &amp; Bhaneja, 2020), to constrain risk of war from a militarised ASI. A treaty-based risk mitigation approach that included cyberwarfare and specifically mentioned ASI-enhanced warfare could affect the conceptualization of the AI race by reducing enmity between countries, increasing the level of openness between them, and raising social awareness of the risk. While these are external constraints, they may also constrain an ASI&#x2019;s attitudes towards humanity in a positive way, either by reducing the threat it may perceive of war being waged against it, even if only symbolically, or by increasing the predictability of human action regarding peace.</p><p>Much work remains to be done on conceptualizing the UGPT, in preliminary drafting of the main body of the treaty and the protocols, in soliciting states&#x2019; interest, and in deliberations assessing thresholds and sovereignty costs, and in the eventual diplomatic conference where states would formally discuss the UGPT. While the UGPT may appear unrealistically ambitious, Mantilla&#x2019;s (2017) work on conforming instrumentalism and the Geneva Conventions suggests a major sponsoring state would rapidly accumulate prestige by endorsing a path to peace, while states standing in the way would accumulate opprobrium, and that the social dynamics of the international community, whether involving social status or instrumental cooperation, do matter.</p><p>Future research on how to constrain the risk of ASI-enabled or directed warfare should consider the importance of peace in different ideologies, for instance Chinese socialism. This is important because, as we have outlined, ASIs developed by different nation-states may well be directed or imbued with different, potentially confrontational, ideologies. For instance, the China Brain Project is embracing a Chinese cultural approach towards neuroethics (Wang et al., 2019), and it is difficult to imagine that a Chinese ASI would not be directed according to Chinese cultural values and its &#x2018;coherent extrapolated volition&#x2019; be informed by communist principles. Similarly, a Russian ASI could be informed by Cosmism and a Western ASI by liberal democratic principles. </p><p>In recommending such research, we caution that an ASI being created by a state engaged in ideological &#x2018;New Cold War&#x2019; framing is likely to be militarized and weaponized. Still a New Cold War framing may have utilitarian function in, exerting social pressures towards signing the UGPT, for Mantilla (2017, pp.509-510) notes, &#x201C;The Cold War context was also likely especially auspicious for the operation of social pressures, sharpening ideological competition in between the liberal, allegedly civilized world and &#x2018;the rest&#x2019;, communist or otherwise.&#x201D; </p><p>Mantilla&#x2019;s (2017) work also suggests excessive rigidity of attitude critical of such treaties may backfire in terms of the social dynamics of global prestige, particularly in the case of major states susceptible to accusations of warlike or imperialist behaviour which are engaged in propaganda wars with other major states. Effectively, the British ratification process for the Geneva Conventions demonstrates that instrumentalist concerns over lack of feasibility or reciprocity can be overruled by social constructivist concerns over &#x2018;world opinion&#x2019;.</p><p>Further research into the UGPT should also involve applying relevant game theory, such as iterated prisoner&#x2019;s dilemma, especially the peace war game (see e.g., Gintis, 2000), to the major nation-states capable of building an ASI, as well as to the ASI itself.  This game theory would need to investigate offering the opportunity for a young ASI to sign the UGPT, as an indicator of goodwill, which may assist in constraining the risk of the ASI waging war on humanity. An ASI with agency as signatory would view the UGPT as an external constraint on its own actions with regard to seeking global domination, in that the ASI would be subverting a humanity-imposed standard that could result in global retaliation and abandonment of mutual cooperation in pursuit of a common agreement on nonkilling and peace norms and values.</p><p>Even if the UGPT does not end humanity&#x2019;s history of conflicts, it would represent a significant improvement in global public aspirations, and instrumental standards, for global peace, both of which may influence an ASI. Paraphrasing the United States Committee on Foreign Relations (1955, p.32), if the end result is only to obtain for those caught in the maelstrom of ASI-enabled or directed war a treatment which is 10 percent less vicious that they would receive without the Treaty, if only a few score of lives are preserved because of these efforts, then the patience and laborious work of all who will have contributed to that goal will not have been in vain.</p><p>That 10 percent difference could sway an ASI not to commit to a war for global domination, even if so directed or initially inclined.</p><p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Allen, G., &amp; Chan, T.

In liquid democracy, as in direct democracy, everyone is able to vote directly on every issue. Of course, in a modern society it’d be prohibitively time-consuming for everyone to research every topic well enough to cast an informed vote. In practice, most who vote would end up following the advice of someone better-informed on the topic. Liquid democracy makes this dynamic explicit by allowing any voter to delegate their vote to someone else that they trust. Their delegate can now vote on their behalf, or else delegate again to someone else.</p><p>Some implementation details of how this system would work:</p><ul><li>If A delegates to B, and B delegates to C, then C now has three votes. There’s no limit to how many times votes can be delegated (except that forming a cycle returns a vote to its original owner).</li><li>It’s a real-time system: any delegation can be changed at any time. In practice we’d need to implement voting and delegation via a secure digital system.</li><li>Voting and delegation would be private for most people, but public for those who have more than a certain number of pledged votes.</li><li>People can also split their delegation by subject area, so they don’t need to find a delegate whose judgement they trust on every topic. For example, A could delegate their vote on economic issues to B, their vote on foreign policy to C, and their vote on everything else to D.</li></ul><p>I have mixed feelings about liquid democracy. There are quite a few reasons why direct democracy is a bad idea, and liquid democracy only solves some of them. In particular, the role of representatives isn’t just to cast votes, but also to <i>design</i>, <i>advocate</i>, and <i>implement</i> good policies, which is a full-time job. Meanwhile there needs to be some way to make all those policies consistent with each other over time - otherwise voters might approve a budget constraint, and then approve individual policies expensive enough to overrun that budget constraint. Then, once the policies have been in effect for long enough to judge their success or failure, we also need to know which groups to praise or blame - since allocating responsibility on an individual basis is hard. In short, electing representatives who belong to political parties to serve multi-year terms in parliament seems like a robustly good idea.</p><p>But I also think that the core insights of liquid democracy are very important ones. People are best able to trust others around them, or public figures whose work they respect - not politicians who they mainly see during large-scale media campaigns. A hierarchical system of delegation is a natural way to scale up while maintaining trust in each link. And it’s also true that no representative can have detailed knowledge about every topic, so we should find some way of making specialist knowledge more accessible to our representatives.</p><p>So I’d like to propose a watered-down version of liquid democracy, which preserves these core insights, but without the problems of direct democracy - and which is also much easier to implement gradually. I envisage it happening in two phases.<br><br><strong>Phase 1: Melting Democracy</strong></p><p>We keep a party-based system of elected representatives, who serve multi-year terms. Everyone can delegate their votes as in liquid democracy, with the same implementation details as described in the previous section (except that people don’t get the opportunity to split their delegation by subject area). Those votes can then be used during parliamentary elections to choose between candidates running for election.</p><p>This may seem like only a modest change. But I think that if delegation is widely adopted, it will improve a number of important dynamics:</p><ol><li><i>Politicians need to run better campaigns</i>. They can’t just use shallow large-scale media tactics, because delegates who have been pledged many votes (let’s call them superdelegates) will have more incentive to investigate platforms and policies in detail. Superdelegates would also have the opportunity to talk to candidates in person, to understand them better.</li><li><i>Trusted figures get more involved in politics</i>. Consider a public figure who’s demonstrated good judgement and trustworthiness in their previous work. While their endorsement might be useful for political candidates, they have no official power within the political system, which makes it more difficult for them to have a positive influence. Having a large number of pledged votes will give them leverage to push for better policies.</li><li><i>A natural funnel into parliament</i>. Running for parliament is difficult not just because of the costs, but also because it’s so abrupt. Candidates need to decide whether to commit to running before knowing how much voters like or trust them. How do we get the best people from other sectors of society to consider a political career? Under melting democracy, they can start gradually getting involved in politics by amassing pledged votes. And they don’t need to spend a lot of money to get started, as long as other superdelegates commit to supporting them.</li><li><i>Easier for new parties to get traction</i>. Right now there’s a coordination problem in supporting small parties for first-past-the-post parliamentary seats. Even if many voters prefer a challenger over the two entrenched parties, unless a large number of them switch at once, their votes will probably be wasted. Melting democracy makes this easier, because superdelegates can coordinate more easily to throw support behind small parties.</li></ol><p>A potential problem is that we’re centralising voting power in superdelegates, which might open the door to corruption. I hope that this will not be a big problem, because anyone can be a delegate. If a politician is involved in some sort of scandal, voters have to wait several years to vote against them - and even then, if the politician is still backed by their party, there might not be any alternative candidate who’s any better. Whereas if a delegate does something morally or legally dubious, voters can immediately re-delegate to anyone else in the country. This doesn’t have any formal effect until the next election, but it does shift informal power away from them rapidly.</p><p>Meanwhile, there’s also a sense in which we’re decentralising power, because now in addition to political parties we also have a parallel system of delegates. It’s possible that delegates all end up segregating along party lines - but because the assignment of votes to delegates can be so fluid, I expect that many superdelegates will serve as independent voices who are capable of challenging entrenched parties.</p><p>Something else I particularly like about this proposal is that <i>it could start without requiring legal changes</i>. That is, you could initially set up an opt-in, non-binding system for delegating votes. While this first system wouldn’t provide all the benefits I outlined above, pledging a vote to someone would still be a way of giving them more influence, allowing them to push for beneficial policies more effectively, and paving the way for them to run for office later on. Then, if the system proves successful, it could gradually be integrated into the democratic process across different countries. This makes it much more realistic than proposals which would require sudden radical changes.<br><br><strong>Phase 2: Functional Constituencies</strong></p><p>The specific way that representatives are elected varies by country. In the UK and the US, all representatives need to win their seat in a given constituency or state, where only the votes of residents count. By contrast, New Zealand and Germany use mixed-member proportional (MMP) voting, in which each person gets to vote twice - once for their local MP, and once for a national political party. The resulting parliament is a mix of MPs who represent specific constituencies, and MPs who represent their party as a whole. I think this is an excellent system; it allows voters to select representatives who care about their local issues and are held responsible for them, while also keeping representation proportional to popularity on a national level (unlike <a href=""https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-32954807"">the UK’s system</a>).</p><p>But if we want representatives who are experts on and accountable for specific issues, then local issues aren’t the only ones which matter. Proponents of liquid democracy are correct in arguing that representatives can’t be experts in every topic they need to legislate on. So what if we added new seats for specific areas of expertise? I don’t think we’d want too many, but it seems important to have several representatives who we trust to represent us well on:</p><ul><li>Economic issues</li><li>Social issues</li><li>Science and technology</li><li>Foreign policy</li></ul><p>While I’ve framed this proposal in the context of MMP, variants could work in many other political systems; the core idea resembles <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_constituency_(Hong_Kong)"">functional constituencies</a> in Hong Kong, and Ireland’s <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocational_panel"">vocational panels</a>. In contrast to the former, I think it’s important to keep the number of categories low, so that they don’t become de facto safe seats for special interest groups. However, if the system works well then more MPs could be added for each category, and maybe a few more domains included. In particular, I’d be excited to see dedicated seats for people with expertise in improving the governmental system itself.</p><p>In contrast to the Irish system, I think that everyone should be allowed to vote for functional representatives - because even though we’re aiming for expertise, there are also normative elements to each of these constituencies. There are several ways we might allocate votes to functional constituencies. The simplest version would be to allow everyone to vote for a representative in each area, in addition to their national and local votes. Voters could then delegate their six votes together or separately, as in liquid democracy. However, I think that’s asking for too much from voters; and it would encourage people to vote for expert representatives in areas where they can’t judge expertise. Probably it would be more reasonable to allow each person to choose only one of these constituencies in which to vote, in addition to their national and local votes.</p><p>In terms of parliamentary voting power, functional MPs probably wouldn’t have much direct sway. But they would be able to influence other MPs and work with them to create better policies. Right now experts are outsiders to the political process. The core goal of both the proposals I’ve advanced in this essay is to break down the barriers between the people whose judgement we trust in civil society, and the people to whom we’re entrusting the powers and responsibilities of government.</p></body></html>",ricraz,ricraz,Richard_Ngo,
n9dnGMQtXxQw9FZWP,"Why anything that can be for-profit, should be",why-anything-that-can-be-for-profit-should-be,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/n9dnGMQtXxQw9FZWP/why-anything-that-can-be-for-profit-should-be,2020-04-29T20:00:09.048Z,51,24,39,False,False,https://rootsofprogress.org/organizational-metabolism-and-the-for-profit-advantage,"<p>In a recent post I surveyed different <a href=""https://rootsofprogress.org/funding-models-for-science-and-innovation"">types of funding models</a>, including nonprofit models such as universities or private foundations, and for-profit models such as startups. Although we need both models, I believe that for-profit models are underrated today. In what follows I will explain some fundamental advantages of the for-profit model.</p><p>To understand these advantages and why they are essential, we have to understand the incentives and feedback loops that exist within the for-profit and nonprofit worlds. One framework I use to think about this is a concept I call <em>organizational metabolism</em>.</p><p>An organization, like a biological organism, has a metabolism: a core set of processes that keep it alive. These processes provide the resources it needs to act, to grow, and to sustain itself. For an organism, the basic resource is energy, whether from food, sunlight or chemicals. For an organization, the basic resource is money, for payroll and other expenses. Just as an animal must eat, an organization must collect revenue, or die.</p><p>Understanding an entity&#x2019;s metabolism is fundamental to understanding its role within an ecosystem of competing entities and the selective pressures it is under. An entity with a successful metabolism survives and grows; one that fails in its metabolism is eliminated. Over time, through natural selection, an ecosystem becomes dominated by the entities with successful metabolism. Different entities can have different designs and make different choices, but the laws of nature decide which of them thrive.</p><hr class=""dividerBlock""><p>Metabolism can be represented as a set of feedback loops. Here is the metabolism of a for-profit business:</p><span><figure><img src=""https://rootsofprogress.org/img/for-profit-metabolism.png"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:100%""></figure></span><p>The main loop is on the right: a business sells a product or service to its customers for a profit. To give birth to a business, investors can put in capital, which must produce a return; this is the loop on the left. Call the right-hand loop the &#x201C;product loop&#x201D; and the left-hand the &#x201C;return loop&#x201D;.</p><p>A business must be profitable over the long term to survive&#x2014;but <em>any</em> business that makes a profit <em>can</em> survive. Similarly, a business must credibly promise a return to receive investment, and an investor must make a return over the long term to continue investing&#x2014;but any promising investment can receive capital, and any successful investor can stay in business. And over time, resources accrue to the most scalable and profitable companies, and to the most successful investors.</p><p>In contrast, here is the metabolism of a nonprofit organization, such as a charity or foundation:</p><span><figure><img src=""https://rootsofprogress.org/img/non-profit-metabolism.png"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:100%""></figure></span><p>A nonprofit also typically provides a product to certain beneficiaries, whether clean water for poor rural areas, or a non-rival good such as research for the world at large. Note however that this product loop <em>is not its core metabolic loop</em>. As we will see, the nonprofit product loop is weak, and sometimes broken.</p><p>The loop that sustains a nonprofit is its return loop. Donors provide the organization with its revenue. What do they get in exchange? What does the organization have to provide to sustain or grow its revenue?</p><p>In theory, donors give because they support the organization&#x2019;s mission: they want to sustain its product loop. In the best case, the product loop is closed with evidence of value delivered, from data and statistics to testimonials and case studies. This is provided to the donors to close the return loop: objective demonstration of success at the organization&#x2019;s mission leads to more and larger donations.</p><p>Not all donors, however, are this discerning, thoughtful, or well-motivated. A charitable donation is often an emotional choice, fueled by moral sentiment. Donors may not demand, or even care for, evidence of success; they may be more persuaded by pictures and stories that tug at the heartstrings, or by the charisma of the executive director. Or they may be driven by motives less honorable than generosity, such as prestige, status, a public image. In short, donors may care less about <em>doing good</em> than about <em>feeling good</em> or <em>looking good</em>.</p><p>To the extent that donations are not driven by proof of effectiveness, the product loop is broken: it is no longer a loop, and it <em>does not matter</em> to the organization&#x2019;s metabolism. The organization may still provide a valuable service, but if so, this is incidental to its survival, an epiphenomenon. The organization is now in a loop of providing a feeling or a social image to its donors, and as long as it can do that, it can survive indefinitely whether or not it does any good for the world.</p><p>It&#x2019;s <em>possible</em> for a pathology like this to exist in a for-profit business&#x2014;the nutritional supplements industry is probably an example&#x2014;but it&#x2019;s restricted to a subset of products for which it is difficult to make rational buying decisions. And even a supplements company would quickly go out of business if it failed to physically deliver its product into the hands of customers&#x2014;yet this kind of failure is <em>routine</em> in the nonprofit world, where disaster-relief donations are often discarded and international aid ends up in the pockets of warlords.</p><p>Nonprofits <em>can</em> of course be effective and efficient, and some are more so than many businesses&#x2014;but this happens more by the grace of an executive with courage and integrity, or the rare strategic donor, than by inherent selective pressures.</p><hr class=""dividerBlock""><p>A second thing to note about these diagrams is that every part of a business&#x2019;s loops can be measured. On the right, the business can measure costs, sales, and profit; on the left, capital, dividends, and return on investment. From fundamental measures such as these are derived a sophisticated system of financial metrics, and an entire discipline to manage them: accounting.</p><p>Financial metrics have a bad reputation; they are the implements of corporate &#x201C;greed&#x201D; and are blamed for everything from sweatshops to pollution to securities fraud. A myopic focus on financial metrics can indeed lead to long-term destructive behavior. But used properly, finance is a powerful tool to promote efficiency and effectiveness. It can identify waste, optimize portfolios, and justify long-term investment. Crucially, it can manage <em>risk</em>.</p><p>Precise, quantitative risk management is especially important in the allocation of resources to early-stage projects. Along the efficient frontier, risk is correlated with potential reward. A mechanism is needed to provide the investor with a higher rate of return in exchange for funding riskier projects. In debt, this is done with interest rates; in equity, by the mechanism of valuations: higher risk is reflected in lower stock prices. Particularly in the world of venture capital, this means there is a <em>disproportionate</em> reward for <em>being right early</em>&#x2014;for being the first backer of a promising project <em>at its inception</em>, when risk is highest.</p><p>The result is that investors are actively incentivized to embrace <em>contrarian</em> theses: they win biggest when they bet on something that the rest of the world would not, once success is proven over time. I know of no such mechanism or incentive in the nonprofit world, where the incentive for donors is if anything the opposite: to seek out safe, consensus causes, especially to the extent that the donor&#x2019;s motivation is prestige or social approval.</p><hr class=""dividerBlock""><p>Organizational metabolism helps explain the strengths and weaknesses of different <a href=""https://rootsofprogress.org/funding-models-for-science-and-innovation"">types of funding models</a>, along the <a href=""https://rootsofprogress.org/questions-to-ask-about-funding-models"">lines I drew in a previous post</a>.</p><p>The weaknesses of the money metabolism come from two key requirements that the nonprofit metabolism does not have. First, you must capture part of the value you create. Second, you must generate a return within the time horizon of investors (about a decade in venture capital). As a result, there is often pressure to fund specific, visible goals rather than completely undirected exploration.</p><p>Conversely, the strength of the nonprofit model is its lack of these limitations. It is probably a better way to support, for example, basic research, which tends to explore uncharted territory to generate open, often unpatentable knowledge that leads to economic value only on the timescale of a generation or more. (There are also reasons to believe that nonprofits are better suited for a variety of areas <a href=""https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/fss_papers/5048/"">from performing arts to nursing care</a>.)</p><p>However, when it is possible, I see great advantages to the for-profit model:</p><ul><li><strong>Revenue is as scalable and reliable as demand itself.</strong> When your market grows, your revenue grows; as long as your unit economics work out, you can scale supply to meet demand. In a nonprofit, if your market grows, <em>only your expenses grow</em>. Your revenue is at best loosely tied to demand. A charity that donates clean water to poor rural Africans may or may not find enough rich Westerners to pay the bill, but a business that figures out how to sell water to them at a profit will serve as many customers as are willing and able to pay. Again, this is not to say that such a charity should not exist, but simply to point out that it has inherent limitations to scale.</li><li><strong>For-profits have the incentives and the metrics to drive effectiveness and efficiency.</strong> A charitable donor may not think strategically about how many meals, mosquito nets, or doses of a vaccine can be delivered for their million-dollar donation. Indeed, to the extent they are motivated not by doing good but by feeling good or looking good, they are likely to measure themselves not on the results but on the <em>amount of money</em> they gave, or the portion of their wealth that represents&#x2014;thus making the fundamental mistake of substituting metrics that measure input for those that measure output. In contrast, a business is constantly driven to serve more customers at lower cost, to expand into new markets and new product lines, to reduce waste, to cancel or overhaul failing programs. (Notable exceptions include many effective altruist organizations, <a href=""https://www.openphilanthropy.org/notable-lessons"">such as Open Philanthropy</a>&#x2014;notable in part because the strategic thinking they evidence is so rare.)</li><li><strong>For-profit investors are more likely to fund high-risk, high-reward experiments.</strong> The incentive for investors to seek contrarian theses at the individual level leads to a <em>diversified global portfolio of bets</em> at the ecosystem level. The mechanism of equity, in particular, allows investors to be rewarded proportional to risk, which allows each investor to build a successful portfolio even when many of their bets fail. Given how many crazy-looking, risky experiments turned into breakthrough innovations that transformed the world, a mechanism that funds them when they are overlooked by others is extremely valuable.</li></ul><hr class=""dividerBlock""><p>These advantages are so great that I submit a bold principle:</p><p><strong>Anything that can be for-profit, should be.</strong></p><p>Corollaries:</p><ul><li>Nonprofit organizations should be formed only as a last resort to fill in the gaps where for-profits cannot work.</li><li>If a given need cannot be served profitably, then finding ways to <em>make profit possible</em> in that area is even better than serving the need with nonprofit organizations.</li><li>Institutions and mechanisms that create opportunities for profit&#x2014;such as property rights, including intellectual property rights&#x2014;create enormous value for a society.</li><li>Conversely, when profit is prohibited in or drained from an industry, it represents an enormous <em>destruction</em> of value.</li></ul><p>As an example, a challenging area of pharmaceutical development is repurposing drugs: discovering that a known drug (which may be off-patent) works for a disease it was not previously known to work for. Patents for this type of use can be <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2018.168"">difficult to obtain and enforce</a>; better market protection for repurposed drugs would make it more profitable to discover these uses, and pharmaceutical investment would follow.</p><hr class=""dividerBlock""><p>Conventional thinking says that money is a corrupting influence. We hear calls to get money out of politics, out of health care, out of everything. I believe the opposite.</p><p>Money illuminates what is murky. It aligns interests. It keeps people honest. Money is, in fact, one of the greatest forces for social good. Instead of getting money out, we should find ways to bring money and profit <em>into</em> as many areas as possible.</p>",jasoncrawford,jasoncrawford,jasoncrawford,

<p><span>The article above, pointed out to me by many good sources, does one of the things we should be doing orders of magnitude more of than we are doing. It attempts to physically model Covid-19, and figure out the ways it spreads </span><i><span>and how relatively dangerous they are. </span></i><span>Then, based on that, it reasons out the wise policy responses and wise personal behaviors.</span></p>
<p>My analysis backs up the article’s conclusions. There are ways out, but they seem implausible.</p>
<p><span>There are three plausible vectors; that part of this article is matched by what I’ve seen everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span>Two of them are airborn:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>According to the binary model established in the 1930s, droplets typically are classified as either (1) large globules of the Flüggian variety—arcing through the air like a tennis ball until gravity brings them down to Earth; or (2) smaller particles, less than five to 10 micrometers in diameter (roughly a 10th the width of a human hair), which drift lazily through the air as fine aerosols.</span></p>
<p>…</p>
<p><span>And it is on this crucial scale that our knowledge is thinnest. Despite the passage of four months since the first known human cases of COVID-19, our public-health officials remain committed to policies that reflect no clear understanding as to whether it is one-off ballistic droplet payloads or clouds of fine aerosols that pose the greatest risk—or even how these two modes compare to the possibility of indirect infection through contaminated surfaces (known as “fomites”).</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span>This seems super important because we are all choosing how paranoid to be about each of these three vectors, </span><i><span>and in what ways. </span></i></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><span>Each of the three vectors has different implications. Here’s the article’s take on them.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<blockquote><p><span>If large droplets are found to be a dominant mode of transmission, then the expanded use of masks and social distancing is critical, because the threat will be understood as emerging from the </span><i><span>ballistic</span></i><span> droplet flight connected to sneezing, coughing, and laboured breathing. We would also be urged to speak softly, avoid “coughing, blowing and sneezing,” or exhibiting any kind of agitated respiratory state in public, and angle their mouths downward when speaking.</span></p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote><p><span>If lingering clouds of tiny aerosol droplets are found to be a dominant mode of transmission, on the other hand, then the focus on sneeze ballistics and the precise geometric delineation of social distancing protocols become somewhat less important—since particles that remain indefinitely suspended in an airborne state can travel over large distances through the normal processes of natural convection and gas diffusion. In this case, we would need to prioritize the use of outdoor spaces (where aerosols are more quickly swept away) and improve the ventilation of indoor spaces.’</span></p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote><p><span>If contaminated surfaces are found to be a dominant mode of transmission, then we would need to continue, and even expand, our current practice of fastidiously washing hands following contact with store-bought items and other outside surfaces; as well as wiping down delivered items with bleach solution or other disinfectants.</span></p></blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>Right now we’re doing some mix of these three things, none of them especially consistently or well. </span></p>
<h3><b>Large Droplets: Six Foot Rule is Understandable, But Also Obvious Nonsense</b></h3>
<p><span>For large droplets, there is essentially zero messaging about angling downwards or avoiding physical actions that would expel more droplets, or avoiding being in the direct path of other people’s potential droplets. </span></p>
<p><span>Instead, we have been told to keep a distance of six feet from other people. We’ve told them that six feet apart is safe, and five feet apart is unsafe. Because the virus can only travel six feet.</span></p>
<p><span>That’s obvious nonsense. It is </span><i><span>very </span></i><span>clear that droplets can go </span><i><span>much</span></i><span> farther than six feet. Even more than that, the concept of a boolean risk function is insane. People expel virus at different velocities, from different heights, under different wind conditions and so on. The physics of each situation will differ. The closer you are, the more risk.</span></p>
<p><span>Intuitively it makes sense to think about something like an inverse square law until proven otherwise, so six feet away is about 3% of the risk of one foot away. That’s definitely not right, but it’s the guess I feel comfortable operating with.</span></p>
<p><span>Alas, that’s not the message. The message is 72 inches safe, 71 inches unsafe.</span></p>
<p><a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2020/04/11/seemingly-popular-covid-19-model-is-obvious-nonsense/""><span>Unlike the previous case of obvious nonsense</span></a><span>, there is a reasonable justification for this one. I am sympathetic. You get about five words. “Always stay six feet apart” is a pretty good five words. There might not be a better one. Six feet is a distance that you can plausibly mandate and still allow conversations and lines that are moderately sane, so it’s a reasonable compromise.</span></p>
<p><span>It’s a </span><i><span>lie. </span></i><span>It’s </span><i><span>not real. </span></i><span>As a pragmatic choice, it’s not bad.</span></p>
<p><span>The problem is </span><i><span>it is being treated as literally real.</span></i></p>
<p><span>Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders met on a debate stage. The diagram plans had them </span><i><span>exactly six feet apart.</span></i></p>
<p><span>In an article, someone invites the author, a reporter, to their house to chat. Says he’s prepared two chairs, six feet apart. “I measured them myself,” he says.</span></p>
<p><span>Lines have markings six feet apart everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span>The parking lot of a Las Vegas hotel marks off spaces six feet apart for homeless people to sleep in, while the hotel is closed. Then of course they sleep end to end within the spaces, so they’re actually one foot apart or less, but then what did you expect.</span></p>
<p><span>And so on. People </span><i><span>really are </span></i><span>trying to make the distance </span><i><span>exactly six feet </span></i><span>as often as possible.</span></p>
<p><span>This isn’t remotely a straw man situation. This is society sacrificing bandwidth to get a message across. </span></p>
<p><span>Again, </span><i><span>I get it. </span></i><span>The problem is we are </span><i><span>also </span></i><span>sacrificing </span><i><span>any ability to convey nuance. </span></i><span>We are incapable, after making this sacrifice, of telling people there is a physical world they might want to think about how to optimize. There is only a rule from on high, The Rule of Six Feet. </span></p>
<p><span>Thus, we may </span><i><span>never </span></i><span>be able to get people to talk softly into the ground rather than directly looking at each other and loudly and forcefully to ‘make up for’ the exact six foot distance, which happens to be the worst possible orientation that isn’t closer than six feet. </span></p>
<p><span>In theory, we can go beyond this. You get infected because droplets from an infected person travel out of their face and touch your face.</span></p>
<p><span>Thus, a </span><i><span>line </span></i><span>is remarkably safe if everyone faces the same way, modulo any strong winds. The person behind you has no vector to get to your face. And we can extend that. We can have one sidewalk where people walk north, and another on the other side of the street where people walk south. If you see someone approaching from the other direction, </span><i><span>turn around and walk backwards</span></i><span> while they ensure the two of you don’t collide. If necessary, stand in place for that reason. Either way, it should help – </span><i><span>if </span></i><span>this is the mechanism we are worried about. </span></p>
<p><span>It would be interesting to go through the SSEs (super spreader events) listed, and see which ones involved people facing only one way, if any. </span></p>
<p><span>Yes, it’s annoying to not face other people, but you absolutely can have a conversation while facing away from each other. It’s a small price to pay.  </span></p>
<p><span>In similar fashion, it seems a small price to pay to </span><i><span>shut the hell up </span></i><span>whenever possible, while out in public. Talking </span><i><span>at all, </span></i><span>when around those outside your household, can be considered harmful and kept to a bare minimum outright (and also it should be done while facing no one). </span></p>
<p><span>Masks and goggles/glasses also obviously help block such infections, and we should all be forever furious at those who lied to us and pretended otherwise. At this point I’m assuming we’ve won that battle, at least among anyone reading this.</span></p>
<h3><b>Aerosol Droplets: Embracing the Great Outdoors</b></h3>
<p><span>The article covers this one well, as the implications are mostly straightforward.</span></p>
<p><span>In sufficiently dense places even being outdoors might not be good enough. At the height of the pandemic in New York City, it seemed likely that the air in recently crowded areas even outdoors was dangerous, even if you managed to stay six feet away slash behind other people. There’s a limit where diffusing the air goes from ‘if we diffuse then everything’s fine’ to ‘if we diffuse then everything’s not fine’ and it’s not obvious where that line might be. Also possible that all outdoor travel is at least tiny risk, at that point. Indoors we now care a lot about ventilation and about who has been in a place. </span></p>
<h3><b>Surfaces: Are They Even Real?</b></h3>
<p><span>I don’t know that we know. We could find out easily enough, if we were willing to be a real civilization that understood that people can make choices and trade-offs, and that was capable of making choices and trade-offs and actually doing things. All you have to do is run physical experiments to find out whether people </span><i><span>actually get infected </span></i><span>from surfaces, at what rates and under what conditions. Then either we ramp up the sanitation messages, or we can stop worrying. </span></p>
<p><span>Alas, we are not a functional civilization in this sense. So we don’t know, and articles like this one, written by non-professionals because someone had to and no one else would, are our best source of educated guesses. We are all doing our own research.</span></p>
<p><span>The precautionary principle here says that one continues to sanitize, so we do, </span><i><span>even though I think it’s probably unnecessary. </span></i><span>A probably unnecessary action that might be very necessary remains necessary.</span></p>
<h3><b>Identified Super Spreader Events are Primarily Large Droplet Transmission</b></h3>
<p><span>The article makes a strong case that </span><i><span>in identified super spreader events </span></i><span>the primary mode of transmission is large droplets. And that large droplets are spread in close proximity, by people talking (basically everything) or singing (several choir/singing practices) frequently or loudly, or laughing (many parties) and crying (funerals), or otherwise exhaling rapidly (e.g. the curling match) and so on.</span></p>
<p><span>There is a highly noticeable absence of SSEs that would suggest other transmission mechanisms. Subways and other public transit aren’t present, airplanes mostly aren’t present. Performances and showings of all kinds also aren’t present. Quiet work spaces aren’t present, loud ones (where you have to yell in people’s faces) do show up. University SSEs are not linked to classes (where essentially only the professor talks, mostly) but rather to socializing. And so on; see</span><a href=""https://quillette.com/2020/04/23/covid-19-superspreader-events-in-28-countries-critical-patterns-and-lessons/""> <span>the full text of the original</span></a><span>, near the end, for full details.</span></p>
<p><span>Also strong is the concrete example of a restaurant where one individual infected many others and the direction of air flow seems convincingly to be the determining factor of who was at risk.</span></p>
<p><span>I buy the core thesis. Identified super spreader events, where lots of people get infected, are primarily fueled by large droplet transmission. The pattern is too consistent to be anything else.</span></p>
<p><span>The easiest way for that to be the case is for large droplets to be the primary means of transmission. But that doesn’t </span><i><span>have </span></i><span>to be the case. What about the alternative possibilities?</span></p>
<h3><b>Are Unidentified Super Spreader Events Different?</b></h3>
<p><span>The sample bias in identified events is not subtle. That doesn’t mean we know its magnitude or direction. What would we expect to cause events to be identified?</span></p>
<p><span>Events where it is easy to track down participants are going to be included, whereas events where it is hard to track down participants are going to be excluded. </span></p>
<p><span>For an event to count, we’ll need to track down participants to first confirm that an SSE took place, and then to figure out how many people likely were infected. If you can’t do those things, it won’t be counted, even if many were infected.</span></p>
<p><span>You’d also have to realize that you should try to do this in the first place.</span></p>
<p><span>Even if it is possible to track participants down, if you don’t know to start doing so in the first place, you won’t. So there needs to be an obvious pattern, </span><i><span>that is noticed and pointed out, </span></i><span>that allows the tracking down to even begin.</span></p>
<p><span>Thus, if a subway car </span><i><span>was </span></i><span>an SSE, would we ever know? It’s not like you can send out a general call for car 5 of the 9:35 red line between stops 9 and 21. You </span><i><span>might </span></i><span>be able to figure out which subway car or which bus a given person was on, but often you won’t be able to even if you’re talking to them. I don’t think people would even try to track these types of things down. </span></p>
<p><span>This explains </span><i><span>some </span></i><span>of the absent types of things, but not others. </span></p>
<p><span>Overall the pattern still holds. </span></p>
<h3><b>Are Super Spreader Events Different from Regular Infections?</b></h3>
<p><span>This is a much bigger issue. We’ll take surfaces first, then small droplets.</span></p>
<p><span>Suppose a third of infections were via surfaces (which I don’t believe).</span></p>
<p><span>Is it plausible that those infections could be distributed and diffuse, rather than creating super spreader events?</span></p>
<p><span>In theory, it’s </span><i><span>possible. </span></i><span>Under this model, people are constantly touching things, and then other people touch those things, and </span><i><span>any one </span></i><span>interaction is low probability of infection, but there’s a lot of them and they add up over time.</span></p>
<p><span>There’s a power law on how often things get touched. A doorknob might be touched once per minute. Your package was touched maybe three times, period. Thus, one doorknob touch is two or three orders of magnitude more dangerous than one package if everyone touches the package in the same place. Since they don’t, it’s more like four or even five orders of magnitude. </span></p>
<p><span>The fall in exposure to surfaces with countermeasures would also seem very, very dramatic with intervention, because you have to actually touch your face before washing your hands in order for it to count. When you touch commonly touched surfaces you know you’ve done it. This has to fall almost entirely on the few people not paying attention. But again, that’s plausibly still a big deal, and doesn’t answer the original question of whether this is something worth guarding against in the first place. </span></p>
<p><span>Still, there’s an upper bound here. Surfaces don’t cause SSEs. We’d probably know it from things like doorknobs and elevator buttons if they did. It’s possible that each person touching an object ends up with a large part of its viral load somehow, which would in turn make subsequent people safer and prevent true SSEs that didn’t have conflated potential causes. Maybe. Or perhaps it requires extensive touching of a surface on both ends, which again makes the infections more diffuse in location and time. But if that is required, it would be that much harder for this to be that big a vector.</span></p>
<p><span>Any one piece of missing evidence is easy to dismiss. But the absence of evidence keeps piling up for surfaces as a major vector. </span></p>
<p><span>Small droplets as a constant small risk is the other possibility. It </span><i><span>makes sense </span></i><span>that they don’t cause SSEs while still perhaps causing a lot of infections. They’re constantly there but not acute, so one is never at a super high risk </span><i><span>at any given time and place </span></i><span>from them, but they’re there a lot because they linger for a long time. In the cases where people do linger in large groups for a while, such that the risk might compound from lots of different infected people continuing to put out small droplets over time that accumulate, there would almost always be a huge confounding with possible large droplets. So even if that happened, we would likely not have noticed it happening.</span></p>
<p><span>It still seems like a long shot. It’s an especially long shot given that contact tracing has been shown to essentially work in multiple places. If small droplets are a major cause, and they linger for a while, contact tracing will break down. Thus, it’s likely that this too is a minor factor in any situation where infection density is sufficiently low for contact tracing. Maybe that changes under mass social distancing plus mass infection, resulting in a meaningful risk from miasma in for example parts of New York City, at least for a while.</span></p>
<h3><b>Focus Only On What Matters</b></h3>
<p><span>So, yes. I think it’s probably large droplets. </span></p>
<p><span>Focus on wearing a mask, on not facing anyone not in your household, on avoiding talking or anyone else who is talking. Aim down whenever possible. And so on. </span></p>
<p><span>That doesn’t mean the other causes aren’t worth avoiding. But unless I’m missing something big, we should be focusing the bulk of our efforts on large droplets, plus direct physical contacts, as the primary source of infection.</span></p>
<p><span>We shouldn’t pay </span><i><span>zero </span></i><span>attention to packages and other surfaces. We shouldn’t pay </span><i><span>zero </span></i><span>attention to small droplets. Better to be safe, even if all you get in most worlds is peace of mind. You feel safe, you know you did everything you could, and so forth.</span></p>
<p><span>As individuals trying to be responsible for ourselves and others, it makes sense to use ‘an abundance of caution’ in such spots. I approve.</span></p>
<p><span>But if I was </span><i><span>running an army that was fighting for survival, </span></i><span>and I had limited resources, I’d devote essentially no resources to those efforts. </span></p>
<p><span>Or if I was </span><i><span>trying to save a global economy, </span></i><span>and I had limited resources, I’d do likewise. I wouldn’t </span><i><span>interfere </span></i><span>with efforts on other lines, but I also wouldn’t sweat them.</span></p>
<p><span>The thing, from the beginning, is that </span><i><span>only the big exposures, and the big mistakes, matter.</span></i></p>
<p><span>Within those big risks, </span><i><span>small changes matter. </span></i><span>They matter more than avoiding small risks entirely.</span></p>
<p><span>A single social event, like a funeral, birthday party or wedding, might well </span><i><span>by default</span></i><span> give any given person a </span><i><span>30%+ rate</span></i><span> to infect any given other person at that event if the event is small, and a reasonably big one even if large. You only need one. Keeping </span><i><span>slightly </span></i><span>more distance, speaking </span><i><span>slightly </span></i><span>less loudly, and so on, at one such event, is a big risk reduction.</span></p>
<p><span>Note that </span><i><span>within-household </span></i><span>transmission rates are not </span><i><span>that </span></i><span>much higher than that and</span><a href=""https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.11.20056010v1.full.pdf""> <span>there are</span></a><a href=""https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30287-5/fulltext""> <span>studies</span></a><span> saying it is lower! Simply being around a person is much less dangerous than the other methods being important would imply.</span></p>
<p><span>Whereas a ‘close contact’ that doesn’t involve talking or close interaction probably gives more like (spitballing a guess, but based on various things) an </span><i><span>0.03% rate </span></i><span>of infection if the other person is positive, and likely with a lower resulting viral load. Certainly those contacts add up, but not that fast. Thus, a subway car full of “close contact” might give you 10 of them per day, most of whom are not, at any given time, infectious. If this model is correct.</span></p>
<p><span>That’s not to minimize the risks one takes there. The big risk is </span><i><span>model error. </span></i><span>We might be wrong about what’s happening. Thus, my best estimate of risk is different from the risk level I’m going to use when deciding what to do. That is as it should be. That’s how we stay alive. </span></p>

We’re abstracting away the low-level model structure (conditionals, loops, function calls, arithmetic, data structures, etc) into a high-level model. The high-level model says “this variable is set to a value which maximizes &lt;blah&gt;”, without saying <i>how</i> that value is calculated. It’s an agent abstraction: an abstraction in which the high-level model is some kind of maximizer.</p><p>Key question: when is this abstraction valid?</p><p><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/ehnG4mseKF6xALmQy/p/TTNS3tk5McHqrJCbR""><u>Abstraction = Information at a Distance</u></a> talks about what it means for an abstraction to be valid. At the lowest level, validity means that the low-level and high-level models return the same answers to some class of queries. But the linked post reduces this to a simpler definition, more directly applicable to the sort of abstractions we use in real life: variables in a high-level model should contain all the information in corresponding low-level variables which is relevant “far away”. We abstract far-away stars to point masses, because the exact distribution of the mass and momentum within the star is (usually) not relevant from far away.</p><p>Or, to put it differently: an abstraction is “valid” when components of the low-level model are independent given the values of high-level variables. The roiling of plasmas within far-apart stars is (approximately) independent given the total mass, momentum, and center-of-mass position of each star. As long as this condition holds, we can use the abstract model to correctly answer questions about things far away/far apart.</p><p>Back to embedded decision theory.</p><p>We want to draw a box around some executing code, and abstract all those low-level operations into a high-level “agent” model - some sort of abstract optimizer. The only information retained by the high-level model is the functional form of the abstracted operations - the overall input-output behavior, represented as “&lt;output&gt; maximizes &lt;objective&gt; at &lt;input&gt;”. All the details of the calculation are thrown out.</p><p>Thing is, those low-level details of the calculation structure? They’re exactly the same for both instances of our agent. (Note: the structure is the same, not necessarily the variable values; this argument assumes that the structure itself is a “variable”. If this is confusing, imagine that instead of two instances of the same source code running on a computer, we’re talking about two organisms of the same species - so the genome of one contains information about the genome of the other.) So if we draw a box around just <i>one</i> of the two instances, then those low-level calculation details we threw out will not actually be independent of the low-level calculation details in the other instance. The low-level structure of the two components - the two agent instances - is not independent given the high-level model; the abstraction is not valid.</p><p>On the other hand, if we draw a box around <i>both</i> instances (along with the source code), and apply an agent abstraction to both of them together… that can work. The system still needs to actually maximize some objective(s) - we can’t just draw a box around all instances of some random python script and declare it to be maximizing a particular function of the outcome - but we at least won’t run into the problem of correlated low-level structure between abstract components. The abstraction won’t leak in the same way.</p><p>Summarizing: we need to draw our box around both instances of the agent because if we only include one instance, then the agent-abstraction leaks. Any abstract model of just one agent-instance as maximizing some objective function of the outcome would be an invalid abstraction.</p><h2>Glaring Problems</h2><p>This setup has some huge glaring holes.</p><p>First and foremost: why do we care about validity of queries on correlations between the low-level internal structures of the two agent-instances? Isn’t the functional behavior all that’s relevant to the outcome? Why care about anything irrelevant to the outcome?</p><p>One response to this is that we don’t want the agent to “know” about its own functional behavior, because then we run into diagonalization problems and logical uncertainty gets dragged in and so forth. We want to treat the functional behavior as unknown-to-the-agent, which means the (known) correlation between low-level behaviors contains important information about correlation between high-level behaviors.</p><p>That’s hand-wavy, and I’m not really satisfied with what the hands are waving at. Ideally, I’d like an approach which doesn’t explicitly drag in logical uncertainty until much later, even if that is a correct way to think about the problem. I suspect there’s a way to do this by reformulating the interventions as explicitly <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/DEDcFw6zWfW9nb2YM/how-to-throw-away-information""><u>throwing away information</u></a> about the agent’s functional behavior, and replacing it with other information. But I haven’t fleshed that out yet.</p><p>Ultimately, at this point the approach looks promising largely on the basis of pattern-matching, and I don’t yet see<i> why</i> this particular abstraction-validity matters. It’s honestly kind of embarrassing.</p><p>Anyway, second problem: What if two instances wound up performing the same function due to convergent evolution, without any correlation between their low-level structures? <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/hLFD6qSN9MmQxKjG5/embedded-agency-via-abstraction?commentId=jbC8934HoXaoXrqhR""><u>Abram has written about this before</u></a>: roughly speaking, he’s argued that embedded decision theory should be concerned about cases where two agents’ behavior is correlated for a reason, not necessarily cases where we just happen to have two agents with exactly the same code. It was a pretty good argument, and I’ll defer to him on that one.</p><h2>Upside</h2><p>We’ve just discussed what I see as the main barriers to making this approach feasible, and they’re not minor. And even with those barriers handled, there’s still a lot of work to properly formalize all this. So what’s the upside? Why pursue an abstraction-first decision theory?</p><p>The main potential is that we can replace fuzzy, conceptual questions about what an agent “should” do with concrete questions about when and whether a particular abstraction is valid. Instead of asking “Is this optimal?” we ask “If we abstract this subsystem into a high-level agent maximizing this objective, is that abstraction valid?”. Some examples:</p><ul><li>“Is my decision process actually optimal right now?” becomes “Is this agent abstraction actually valid right now?”</li><li>“In what situations does this perform optimally?” becomes “In what situations is this agent abstraction valid?”</li><li>“How can we make this system perform optimally in more situations?” becomes “How can we make this agent abstraction valid in more situations?”</li></ul><p>In all cases, we remove “optimality” from the question. More precisely, an abstraction-first approach would <i>fix</i> a notion of optimality upfront (in defining the agent abstraction), then look at whether the agent abstraction implied by that notion of optimality is actually valid.</p><p>Under other approaches to embedded decision theory, a core difficulty is figuring out what notion of “optimality” to use in the first place. For instance, there’s <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5bd75cc58225bf067037535c/entangled-equilibria-and-the-twin-prisoners-dilemma""><u>the argument</u></a> that one should cooperate in a prisoner’s dilemma when playing against a perfect copy of oneself. That action is “optimal” under an entirely different set of “possible choices” than the usual Nash equilibrium model.</p><p>So that’s one big potential upside.</p><p>The other potential upside of an abstraction-first approach is that it would hopefully integrate nicely with abstraction-first notions of map-territory correspondence. I’ll probably write another post on that topic at some point, but here’s the short version: straightforward notions of map-territory correspondence in terms of information compression or predictive power don’t really play well with abstraction. Abstraction is inherently about throwing away information we don’t care about, while map-territory correspondence is inherently about keeping and using all available information. A New York City subway map is <i>intentionally</i> a lossy representation of the territory, it’s obviously throwing out predictively-relevant information, yet it’s still “correct” in some important sense.</p><p>“Components of the low level model are independent given the corresponding high-level variables” is the most useful formulation I’ve yet found of abstraction-friendly correspondence. An abstraction-first decision theory would fit naturally with that notion of correspondence, or something like it. In particular, this formulation makes it immediately obvious why an agent would sometimes want to randomize its actions: randomization may be necessary to make the low-level details of one agent-instance independent of another, so that the desired abstraction is valid.</p>",johnswentworth,johnswentworth,johnswentworth,

To get a better outside view, AI Impacts has been looking for large discontinuities in historical technological trends. A discontinuity is measured by how many years ahead of time that value is reached, relative to what would have been expected by extrapolating the trend. </p><p>They found ten 100-year discontinuous events, for example in ship size (The SS <em>Great Eastern</em>), the average speed of military payload across the Atlantic Ocean (the first ICBM), and the warmest temperature of superconduction (yttrium barium copper oxide). </p><p>There are also some interesting negative examples of discontinuities. Particularly relevant to AI are AlexNet not being a discontinuity on the ImageNet benchmark and chess performance not having any discontinuities in Elo rating.</p><p><strong>Nicholas&apos; opinion:</strong> Ignoring the George Washington Bridge (which confuses both me and the authors), I&#x2019;d roughly categorize the causes of these discontinuities as</p><p>- 3 of them were due to a concerted but apparently misplaced effort towards something others weren&#x2019;t trying to do. These are Pyramid of Djoser, SS Great Eastern, and the Paris Gun.</p><p>- 2 of them were due to the Atlantic Ocean causing a threshold effect (as they explain in the post). These are the ICBM and the first nonstop transatlantic flight.</p><p>- 4 of them were due to a new technological breakthrough followed by increased investment and a faster rate of progress. These are the two telegraph cables, nuclear weapons, and superconductors.</p><p>Of these, the final category seems the most relevant to AGI timelines, and I could imagine AGI development following a similar trajectory, where a major breakthrough causes a large amount of investment and then we have much faster progress on AI going forward.</p><p>I was quite surprised that AlexNet did not represent a discontinuity on ImageNet performance. It is widely regarded to have kicked off deep learning in the computer vision community. I&#x2019;m not sure if this is because the discontinuity metric they use doesn&#x2019;t correspond with my sense of a &#x201C;breakthrough&#x201D;, because there were only two years of ImageNet beforehand, or because the vision community is just mistakenly attributing gradual progress to one major event.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> I agree with Nicholas that the final category seems most relevant to AI progress. Note though that even for this analogy to hold, you need to imagine a major AI breakthrough, since as Nicholas pointed out, these discontinuities were caused by a radically new technology (telegraph cables replacing ships, nuclear weapons replacing conventional bombs, and ceramic superconductors replacing alloy superconductors). This doesn&apos;t seem likely in worlds where progress is driven primarily by <strong><a href=""https://blog.openai.com/ai-and-compute/"">compute</a></strong> (<strong><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/3e550712419a/alignment-newsletter-7"">AN #7</a></strong>), but could happen if (as academics often suggest) deep learning hits a wall and we need to find other AI algorithms to make progress.</p><p><strong><a href=""https://aiimpacts.org/description-vs-simulated-prediction/"">Description vs simulated prediction</a></strong> <em>(Rick Korzekwa)</em> (summarized by Nicholas): AI Impacts&#x2019; investigation into discontinuous progress intends to answer two questions:</p><p>1. How did tech progress happen in the past?</p><p>2. How well could it have been predicted beforehand?</p><p>These can diverge when we have different information available now than in the past. For example, we could have more information because later data clarified trends or because the information is more accessible. We might have less information because we take an outside view (looking at trends) rather than an inside view (knowing the specific bottlenecks and what might need to be overcome).</p><p>The post then outlines some tradeoffs between answering these two questions and settles on primarily focusing on the first: describing tech progress in the past. </p><p><strong>Nicholas&apos; opinion:</strong> I don&#x2019;t have a strong opinion between which of these two questions is most important to focus on. It makes sense to me to work on them both in parallel since the data required is likely to be the same. My concern with this approach is that there is no clear denominator to the discontinuities they find. The case studies convince me that discontinuities <strong>can</strong> happen, but I really want to know the <strong>frequency</strong> with which they happen.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> Given that we want to use this to forecast AI progress, it seems like we primarily care about the second question (simulated prediction). However, it&apos;s <em>really hard</em> to put yourselves in the shoes of someone in the past, making sure to have exactly the information that was available at the time; as a result I broadly agree with the decision to focus more on a description of what happened.</p><h1>TECHNICAL AI ALIGNMENT </h1><h2>PROBLEMS </h2><p><strong><a href=""https://deepmind.com/blog/article/Specification-gaming-the-flip-side-of-AI-ingenuity"">Specification gaming: the flip side of AI ingenuity</a></strong> <em>(Victoria Krakovna et al)</em> (summarized by Rohin): This post on the DeepMind website explains the concept of <strong><a href=""https://vkrakovna.wordpress.com/2018/04/02/specification-gaming-examples-in-ai/"">specification gaming</a></strong> (<strong><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/ff6340049bd0/alignment-newsletter-1"">AN #1</a></strong>), and illustrates three problems that arise within it. First and most obviously, we need to capture the human concept of a given task in a reward function. Second, we must design agents without introducing any mistaken implicit assumptions (e.g. that the physics simulation is accurate, when it isn&apos;t). Finally, we need to ensure that agents don&apos;t tamper with their reward functions.</p><h2>INTERPRETABILITY </h2><p><strong><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01318"">Finding and Visualizing Weaknesses of Deep Reinforcement Learning Agents</a></strong> <em>(Christian Rupprecht et al)</em> (summarized by Rohin): This paper proposes a new visualization tool in order to understand the behaviour of agents trained using deep reinforcement learning. Specifically, they train a generative model which produces game states, and then optimise a distribution over state embeddings according to some target function (such as high reward for taking a specific action). By sampling from the resulting distribution, they create a diverse set of realistic states that score highly according to the target function. They propose a few target cost functions, which allow them to optimise for states in which the agent takes a particular action, states which are high reward (worst Q-value is large), states which are low reward (best Q-value is small), and critical states (large difference in Q value). They demonstrate results on Atari games as well as a simulated driving environment.</p><p><strong>Robert&apos;s opinion:</strong> I liked the paper, and I&apos;m in favour of new work on interpreting reinforcement learning agents; I think it&apos;s under explored and useful, and relevant to AI safety. The methods seem in a similar vein to Feature Visualisation methods for classic vision, but focused solely on the resulting behaviour of the agent; it&apos;d be interesting to see if such methods can give insight into the internals of RL agents. It&apos;s also a shame the demonstration of the results is wholly qualitative; the authors demonstrate some apparent flaws in the agents, but don&apos;t produce any results which show that the insights their method produces are useful. I think the insights are useful, but it&apos;s difficult to validate the claim, and I&apos;m cautious of work which produces interesting and seemingly insightful methods but doesn&apos;t validate that the methods produce actually useful insight.</p><p><strong><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08484"">Estimating Training Data Influence by Tracking Gradient Descent</a></strong> <em>(Garima Pruthi et al)</em> (summarized by Robert): This paper presents the TrackIn method for tracking the influence of training datapoints on the loss on a test datapoint. The purpose of the method is to discover influential training points for decisions made on the testing set. This is defined (loosely) for a training point <strong>x</strong> and test point <strong>z</strong> as the total change in loss on <strong>z</strong> caused by training on <strong>x</strong>. They present several approximations and methods for calculating this quantity efficiently, <em>allowing them to scale their method to ResNet 50 models trained on ImageNet</em></p><p>The standard method of evaluation for these kinds of methods is finding mislabelled examples in the training dataset. Mislabelled examples are likely to have a strong positive influence on their own loss (strong as they&apos;re outliers, and positive as they&apos;ll reduce their own loss). Sorting the training dataset in decreasing order of this self-influence, we should hence expect to see more mislabelled examples at the beginning of the list. We can measure what proportion of mislabelled examples is present in each different initial segments of the list. The authors perform this experiment on CiFAR, first training a model to convergence, and then mislabelling 10% of the training set as the next highest predicted class, and then retraining a new model on which TrackIn is run. <em>When compared to the two previous methods from the literature (Influence Functions and Representer Points), TrackIn recovers more than 80% of the mislabelled data in the first 20% of the ranking, whereas the other methods recover less than 50% at the same point. For all segments TrackIn does significantly better.</em></p><p>They demonstrate the method on a variety of domains, including NLP tasks and vision tasks. The influential examples found seem reasonable, but there&apos;s no quantification of these results.</p><p><strong>Read more:</strong> <strong><a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.04730.pdf"">Understanding Black-box Predictions via Influence Functions</a></strong></p><p><strong>Robert&apos;s opinion:</strong> It&apos;s interesting to see methods able to identify which parts of the training data have an impact on the decisions of a model. I think the approach taken here (and in Influence Functions) of using the change in the test loss is OK, but it doesn&apos;t seem to be exactly what I think when I say &quot;which datapoints had the most influence on this decision being made in this way?&quot;. It&apos;s also difficult to compare these methods without either a benchmark, a human experiment, or some way of demonstrating the method has produced novel insight which has been verified. The mislabelled data experiment partially fulfils this, but isn&apos;t what these methods are ultimately designed for, and is hence unsatisfactory.</p><h2>FORECASTING </h2><p>Various trends relevant to AI alignment <em>(Asya Bergal and Daniel Kokotajlo)</em> (summarized by Rohin): AI Impacts has published a few analyses of trends relevant to AI alignment (see links below).</p><p>Will we see a continuous or discontinuous takeoff? <strong><a href=""https://sideways-view.com/2018/02/24/takeoff-speeds/"">Takeoff speeds</a></strong> operationalizes continuous takeoff (there called &quot;slow takeoff&quot;) as: There will be a complete 4 year interval in which world output doubles, before the first 1 year interval in which world output doubles. AI impacts searched for <strong><a href=""https://aiimpacts.org/precedents-for-economic-n-year-doubling-before-4n-year-doubling/"">precedents for economic n-year doubling before 4n-year doubling</a></strong>, and found that this happened between 4,000 and 3,000 BC, and probably also between 10,000 and 4,000 BC. (Note this implies there was a 6000-year doubling before the 1000-year doubling, even though there wasn&apos;t a 4000-year doubling.)</p><p>How hard will it be to solve a crisply-stated problem of alignment? One way to get an outside view on the matter is to look at <strong><a href=""https://aiimpacts.org/resolutions-of-mathematical-conjectures-over-time/"">resolutions of mathematical conjectures over time</a></strong>. While there is obvious sampling bias in which conjectures are remembered as being important, the results could nonetheless be informative. They find that &quot;the data is fit closely by an exponential function with a half-life of 117 years&quot;.</p><p>Since AI progress seems to be driven at least partially by <strong><a href=""https://blog.openai.com/ai-and-compute/"">compute</a></strong> (<strong><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/3e550712419a/alignment-newsletter-7"">AN #7</a></strong>), forecasting trends in compute seems important to forecasting AI progress. <strong><a href=""https://aiimpacts.org/trends-in-dram-price-per-gigabyte/"">DRAM price per gigabyte</a></strong> has fallen by about an order of magnitude every 5 years from 1957 to 2020, although since 2010, the data suggests more like 14 years for a drop by an order of magnitude. <strong><a href=""https://aiimpacts.org/2019-recent-trends-in-geekbench-score-per-cpu-price/"">Geekbench score per CPU price</a></strong> has grown by around 16% a year from 2006-2020, which would yield an order of magnitude over 16 years. This is slower than other <strong><a href=""https://aiimpacts.org/trends-in-the-cost-of-computing/"">CPU growth trends</a></strong>, but this could be because Geekbench score is a markedly different metric.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> I&apos;m surprised that mathematical conjectures take so long to be resolved, I would have expected a smaller half-life than <em>117 years</em>. I&apos;m not sure if I should update strongly though -- it&apos;s possible that we only remember conjectures that took a long time to be resolved (though it&apos;s somewhat surprising then how well the data fits an exponential).</p><p><strong><a href=""https://aiimpacts.org/surveys-on-fractional-progress-towards-hlai/"">Surveys on fractional progress towards HLAI</a></strong> <em>(Asya Bergal)</em> (summarized by Rohin): One way to predict AGI timelines is to ask experts to estimate what fraction of progress has been made over a fixed number of years, then to extrapolate to the full 100% of progress. Doing this with the <strong><a href=""https://aiimpacts.org/2016-expert-survey-on-progress-in-ai/"">2016 expert survey</a></strong> yields an estimate of 2056 (36 years from now), while doing this with Robin Hanson&apos;s informal ~15-expert survey gives 2392 (372 years from now). Part of the reason for the discrepancy is that Hanson only asked experts who had been in their field for at least 20 years; restricting to just these respondents in the 2016 survey yields an estimate of 2162 (142 years from now).</p><h2>MISCELLANEOUS (ALIGNMENT) </h2><p><strong><a href=""https://aiimpacts.org/survey-of-prescient-actions/"">Survey of prescient actions</a></strong> <em>(Rick Korzekwa)</em> (summarized by Rohin): AI Impacts is looking into other examples in history where people took actions in order to address a complex, novel, severe future problem, and in hindsight we recognize those actions as prescient. Ideally we could learn lessons for AI alignment from such cases. The survey is so far very preliminary, so I&apos;ll summarize it later when it has been further developed, but I thought I&apos;d send it along if you wanted to follow along (I found the six cases they&apos;ve identified quite interesting).</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> One particularly interesting finding is that so far, in all of the cases they&apos;ve looked at, there was a lot of feedback available to develop a solution. The post notes that this could be interpreted in two ways. First, since feedback is abundant in real-world problems, we should expect feedback for AI alignment as well (<strong><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/b3dc916ac7e2/an-80-why-ai-risk-might-be-solved-without-additional-intervention-from-longtermists"">the optimistic take</a></strong>). Second, since AI alignment has no opportunity for feedback, it is unlike other problems (<strong><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/Gg9a4y8reWKtLe3Tn/the-rocket-alignment-problem"">the pessimistic take</a></strong> (<strong><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/0212425e5544/alignment-newsletter-27"">AN #27</a></strong>)). I would add a third option: that any real-world problem without feedback is extremely hard to solve, and so we wouldn&apos;t generate any hypotheses of actions that were prescient for such problems (in which case AI risk is not special amongst problems, it is just an instance of a very difficult problem).</p><h1>AI STRATEGY AND POLICY </h1><p><strong><a href=""https://openai.com/blog/improving-verifiability/"">Improving Verifiability in AI Development</a></strong> <em>(Miles Brundage et al)</em> (summarized by Flo): This multi-stakeholder report by authors from 30 different organizations proposes mechanisms to help with making claims about AI systems easier to verify. Despite being far from a complete solution to responsible AI development, verifiable claims can enable the public to hold developers accountable to comply with their stated ethics principles and allow developers to build trust by providing hard evidence about safety and fairness of their system. Better mechanisms for making such claims could also: i) help with the regulation of AI systems, ii) improve safety by counterbalancing competitive pressures to cut corners, and iii) help independent outside parties to assess the risk posed by specific applications. </p><p>The proposed mechanisms cluster into three classes: institutional, software, and hardware. Institutional mechanisms act on the incentives AI developers face. These include <strong>third party auditing</strong> of AI systems, for which a task force investigating different options would be helpful, and the <strong>publication of incidents</strong>, to provide evidence that incidents are taken seriously and prevent others from repeating the same mistakes. Other approaches are broadly analogous to adversarial training: collaborative <strong>red teaming exercises</strong> help to explore risks, and <strong>bias and safety bounties</strong> incentivize outsiders to seek out and report problems.</p><p>Software mechanisms include <strong>audit trails</strong> that are used in many safety-critical applications in other industries, better <strong>interpretability</strong> to help with risk assessment and auditing, as well as better tools and standardization for <strong>privacy-preserving machine learning</strong>. The proposed hardware mechanisms are <strong>secure hardware for machine learning</strong>, which requires additional investment as machine learning often uses specialized hardware such that progress in the security of commodity hardware cannot be directly leveraged, <strong>high-precision compute measurement</strong> to help with verifying claims about how many computational resources were used for a particular project, and <strong>compute support for academia</strong> to allow academic researchers to better scrutinize claims made by the AI industry. </p><p><strong>Read more:</strong> <strong><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07213"">Paper: Toward Trustworthy AI Development: Mechanisms for Supporting Verifiable Claims</a></strong></p><p><strong>Flo&apos;s opinion:</strong> It would be exciting to see policymakers and AI developers experimenting with the proposed mechanisms, not because I am confident that all of these mechanisms will be useful for incentivising safer AI development, but because trying solutions and observing their specific shortcomings is useful for coming up with better solutions, and trying things early gives us more time to improve and iterate. However, the danger of lock-in is real as well: if the mechanisms won&apos;t be iterated on, delaying implementation until everything is watertight could be the better option. On the level of concrete mechanisms, regular red teaming exercises and more research on interpretability seem especially useful for safety, as common interaction with failure modes of AI systems seems to make safety issues more salient.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> I love seeing these huge collaborations that simply enumerate possibilities for achieving some goal (the previous one, also organized by Miles, is the <strong><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.07228"">Malicious use of AI paper</a></strong>). It gives me much more confidence that the list is in some sense &quot;exhaustive&quot;; any items not on the list seem more likely to have been intentionally excluded (as opposed to the authors failing to think of those items).</p><p>That said, these mechanisms are still only one type of way that you could use to build trust -- in practice, when I trust people, it&apos;s because I think they also want to do the things I want them to do (whether because of external incentives or their intrinsic goals). I wonder how much this kind of trust building can be done with AI. For example, one story you could tell is that by producing compelling evidence that a particular algorithm is likely to lead to an existential catastrophe, you can build trust that no one will use that algorithm, at least as long as you believe that everyone strongly wants to avoid an existential catastrophe (and this outweighs any benefits of running the algorithm).</p><h4><strong>FEEDBACK</strong></h4><p>I&apos;m always happy to hear feedback; you can send it to me, <strong><a href=""https://rohinshah.com/"">Rohin Shah</a></strong>, by <strong>replying to this email</strong>.                         </p><h4><strong>PODCAST</strong></h4><p>An audio podcast version of the <strong>Alignment Newsletter</strong> is available.

<blockquote>
<p>Building open-domain chatbots is a challenging area for machine learning research. While prior work has shown that scaling neural models in the number of parameters and the size of the data they are trained on gives improved results, we show that other ingredients are important for a high-performing chatbot. Good conversation requires a number of skills that an expert conversationalist blends in a seamless way: providing engaging talking points and listening to their partners, both asking and answering questions, and displaying knowledge, empathy and personality appropriately, depending on the situation. We show that large scale models can learn these skills when given appropriate training data and choice of generation strategy. We build variants of these recipes with 90M, 2.7B and 9.4B parameter neural models, and make our models and code publicly available under the collective name Blender. Human evaluations show our best models are superior to existing approaches in multi-turn dialogue in terms of engagingness and humanness measurements. We then discuss the limitations of this work by analyzing failure cases of our models.</p>

I&#x2019;ve personally been settling into the new normal. On the other hand, I&#x2019;ve witnessed first hand some of the risks that might be coming with COVID. I had to take shelter in a tornado warning for the first time in my life. While the tornado and the destruction were luckily quite minimal, there was a power failure for about a day and social distancing made it a lot harder to wait out the power failure in a nearby library or Starbucks. Overall, I&#x2019;m lucky my life is so safe that this is the biggest problem, but I am worried about people who might be a lot less likely and face strong hurricanes or wildfires while also having to maintain social distancing. More on this in a bit.</p><p>If you&#x2019;re just joining us, I follow COVID-19 a lot and this is my third semi-regular installment of a public consolidated brief that tries to consolidate everything I read into one short, actionable list so other people can stay up to date without reading a ton on their own. For this issue, I spent over 25 additional hours trying to get to the bottom of everything so that you don&#x2019;t have to. This way I can save time and <u><a href=""https://distill.pub/2017/research-debt/"">fight research debt</a></u> and save you time from having to read all of this yourself. That being said, do keep in mind that I am not an expert and I have not been able to cover everything going on - I had to be fairly selective to make this brief actually somewhat brief.</p><p>I&#x2019;m not sure how often I will do these, but I still intend to do them as I am able.

Vaccines, Treatments, Testing, Tracing, etc.</h2><h3>The Grand Reopening</h3><p>Getting out of this mess is top of mind as the biggest news of the moment seems to be how we handle re-opening.</p><h4>The United States</h4><p><u><a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/23/pence-says-16-states-have-released-plans-to-lift-coronavirus-restrictions.html"">NBC reports that according to US Vice President Pence</a></u> sixteen US states have unveiled &#x201C;formal reopening plans&#x201D; to lift coronavirus restrictions.</p><p>It&#x2019;s worth reiterating the <u><a href=""https://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/National-Coronavirus-Response-a-Road-Map-to-Recovering-2.pdf"">&#x201C;National Coronavirus Response: A Roadmap for Re-Opening&#x201D;</a></u> plan from the American Enterprise Institute that <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/3npE798Z7A4m7WTx3/peter-s-covid-consolidated-brief-for-2-april"">I last covered in my previous brief</a></u> as it is now basically <u><a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/openingamerica/"">the official plan endorsed by Donald Trump</a></u>. As I mentioned before, this proceeds in three broad phases:</p><p><strong>Phase I: Slow the Spread.</strong> Widespread school closures, work-from-home, close malls and gyms, and limit restaurants.</p><p><strong>Phase II: State-by-State Reopening.</strong> Individual states are able to move to Phase II as they are identified to be able to safely diagnose, treat, and isolate COVID-19 cases and contacts. Testing must be scaled up rapidly. These states can gradually reopen schools and businesses, but will likely need to maintain some degree of physical distancing and limitations on larger gatherings. Older adults will also need to remain at home.</p><blockquote>The trigger for issuing a stay-at-home advisory in a US state is when case counts are doubling every three to five days (based on the current New York experience) or when state and local officials recommend it based on the local context (for example, growth on track to overwhelm the health system&#x2019;s capacity). The trigger for issuing a recommendation to step down from a stay-at-home-advisory back to &#x201C;slow the spread&#x201D; is when the number of new cases reported in a state has declined steadily for 14 days (i.e., one incubation period) and the jurisdiction is able to test everyone seeking care for COVID-19 symptoms.</blockquote><p><strong>Phase III: Lifting restrictions.</strong> Phase III will also be gradually reached on a state-by-state basis &#x201C;once a vaccine has been developed, has been tested for safety and efficacy, and receives FDA emergency use authorization&#x201D; OR &#x201C;there are other therapeutic options that can be used for preventive or treatment indications and that have a measurable impact on disease activity and can help rescue very sick patients&#x201D;.</p><p>~</p><p>The point of these lockdowns has been to buy us time to (1) build up hospital capacity to handle a larger future wave and (2) build up testing/tracing/isolation capacity to be able to more finely quarantine just those with COVID. Insofar as we&#x2019;re accomplishing (1) and (2), we can start reopening the economy.</p><p>My current guess about re-opening is that there won&#x2019;t be a single binary &#x201C;everything back to normal&#x201D; event like it seems people are conceptualizing it. <strong>People think of &#x201C;reopening&#x201D; as &#x201C;everything goes back to how it was before the coronavirus&#x201D;, but that seems quite unlikely.</strong></p><p>Instead, <strong>I expect the country to gradually reopen, largely in reverse of the way that it closed, except a lot slower.</strong> That is, the things that were closed last (e.g., parks) will be reopened first - potentially really soon - whereas the things that we closed first (e.g., concerts, conferences) will be reopened last - and potentially not until after we have a widespread vaccine.</p><p>For a look at what the very first step might be, look to <u><a href=""https://twitter.com/GovofCO/status/1253105369871572992"">the new &#x201C;Safer at Home&#x201D; policy of Colorado</a></u> that basically reopens private gatherings with less than ten people, one-to-one real estate home showings, curbside pickup, and not much else:</p><p><figure><img src=""https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/QS8xyX5BuPqWTkORlo4saxXC0T2g1txo82SGWFDMrmUKIU_OE77zW6O_h51JdVqM_ooHSkfKD475KhRy3FEIGmWhcppw6U6JDe4jobtZT_fUVDH-UhiqysI7pyzECCprYQdu4Xc4"" class=""draft-image "" style=""width:413%""></figure></p><p><figure><img src=""https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/oSei_s38kNJyiBdxY4Uf2aFPUdY9XoCVJKxYTictDQ5iRhLMVohjPrfngFb7E3OkCcF3KsjEpIvABMcd7IkQh063S2exbnGDyLhTCiph4Qf0Z2QLSCysKo_7YwhDXcH1OpfchEYi"" class=""draft-image "" style=""width:412%""></figure></p><p>~</p><p>Some governors and mayors have been a bit more gung ho about reopening, however.</p><p>The semi-serious <u><a href=""https://twitter.com/GovKemp/status/1252339586291949568"">Georgia is permitting a reopening</a></u> of &#x201C;gyms, fitness centers, bowling alleys, body art studios, barbers, cosmetologists, hair designers, nail care artists, estheticians&#x201D; with &#x201C;screening workers for fever and respiratory illness, enhancing workplace sanitation, wearing masks &amp; gloves if appropriate, separating workspaces by six feet, teleworking if possible &amp; implementing staggered shifts&#x201D;.</p><p>Even Trump seems to think this is too much, saying &#x201C;I disagree strongly with [Governor Kemp&#x2019;s] decision to open certain facilities which are in violation of the Phase One guidelines [...] I think spas, and beauty salons, and tattoo parlors, and barber shops, in Phase One &#x2026; is just too soon. &#x2026; They can wait a little bit longer.&#x201D;</p><p>~</p><p><u><a href=""https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/27/845682973/tennessee-restaurants-reopen-as-state-sees-biggest-one-day-jump-in-covid-19-case"">Tennessee is also reopening restaurants and some other businesses</a></u>:</p><blockquote>The new restrictions include limiting capacity to 50% and ensuring tables are no less than 6 feet apart, with no more than half a dozen people per table.

For better or worse, unpredicted developments such as the fracking boom and other factors put an end to talk of &#x201C;peak oil.&#x201D; [...] Some of this proved true but far less lasting than predicted.

So far, we&#x2019;ve done reasonably well at adhering to social distancing for long periods of time with only minimal protesting. I hope this can last for many more months, but I&#x2019;m unsure. As Ezra Klein summarizes - <u><a href=""https://www.vox.com/2020/4/10/21215494/coronavirus-plans-social-distancing-economy-recession-depression-unemployment?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Future%25252520Perfect%2525252041420&amp;utm_content=Future%25252520Perfect%2525252041420+CID_1a9521a62c543b134ae6bfbfff84e8f2&amp;utm_source=cm_email&amp;utm_term=why%25252520theyre%25252520all%25252520really%25252520scary"">&quot;I&#x2019;ve read the plans to reopen the economy.

The real point is that we just don&#x2019;t really know, as we don&#x2019;t know how much voluntary social distancing will remain in place, among many other uncertainties. But previously we knew that it actually took an exceptionally strong lockdown to keep deaths down, so reversing that back to a not-all-that-strong lockdown could be disproportionately bad.

If Georgia had maintained its pre-Friday lockdown policy, the Harvard/MIT team&#x2019;s simulation&#x2014;which used data from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center and accounts for local demographics and health conditions based on Census and survey data&#x2014;estimated the state would have logged a total of between 1,004 and 2,922 coronavirus fatalities by June 15. That fatality range, like all such ranges detailed in this article, includes deaths that had already been documented (in this case, 871).</blockquote><blockquote>By contrast, under Kemp&#x2019;s current plan to reopen, if approved businesses returned to just 50 percent of their pre-pandemic activity (or &#x201C;contact&#x201D;) levels, that range could reach 1,604 to 4,236 deaths. At 100 percent of pre-shutdown activity, the projected final body count could soar to a range between 4,279 and 9,748.</blockquote><p><u><a href=""https://time.com/5826918/hokkaido-coronavirus-lockdown/"">One potential cautionary tale might be Japan&#x2019;s northern island of Hokkaido</a></u>:<br></p><blockquote>It acted quickly and contained an early outbreak of the coronavirus with a 3-week lockdown. But, when the governor lifted restrictions, a second wave of infections hit even harder. Twenty-six days later, the island was forced back into lockdown.</blockquote><p>However, again, uncertainty remains a concern. If we make dire predictions that overestimate the return to normal activity or underestimate potential beneficial effects of mask wearing, weather, etc., it&#x2019;s possible things might not be as dire as they sound, which could lead to people distrusting these expert predictions more. ...On the other hand, things could end up worse than projected.</p><h4>Colleges</h4><p>For another question, when and how will Harvard reopen for the fall term? <u><a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/27/us/harvard-fall-reopening/index.html"">Here&#x2019;s how they&#x2019;re thinking about it</a></u>:<br></p><blockquote>Harvard will be open for the fall semester, but some or all instruction may continue to be online, the university&apos;s provost said Monday.

It&#x2019;s possible existing drugs or new treatments could greatly reduce the danger of COVID and allow for faster reopening, but it would take a vaccine to truly make it go away.</p><p>So let&#x2019;s zoom in a bit on vaccines. Keep in mind that producing a vaccine in 1.5 years is by far the landspeed record for making vaccines. The ebola vaccine took five years and as I researched in 2017, it <u><a href=""https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/8qMDseJTE3vCFiYec/how-long-does-it-take-to-research-and-develop-a-new-vaccine"">historically takes on average thirty (!!) years</a></u>.

In essence, the government commits to paying a proportion of the manufacturer&#x2019;s preparation costs should the product turn out not to be viable. (If the product is viable, it can be sold as normal.) This reduces the risk to the company while maintaining an incentive to produce a high-quality product quickly and at scale.</blockquote><h2>A Bit About Life Under Quarantine</h2><p>COVID certainly is taking a toll on all of us. <u><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VubWlYr9Ek"">Pete Davidson and Adam Sandler have teamed up to sing about it</a></u>.

We don&apos;t understand how that could happen, but we also don&apos;t understand how SARS1 was eliminated, so uncertainty means there has to be a decent shot that the same will happen again. This leaves an 80% probability that it will spread widely, which means there&apos;s a decent chance it will go on to cause millions or tens of millions of deaths.</blockquote><blockquote>What great ability did we use to gain this insight which others missed?

As a consequence, young chickens have been killed in massive numbers, in horrific ways. Moreover, animals who are transported alive are being subjected to extraordinary precarious conditions.</blockquote><blockquote>Fishing and aquaculture are the economic activities that have suffered the worst consequences of the pandemic.</blockquote><blockquote>Production and consumption of animal-based products: The disease is also affecting international meat and egg prices due to disruptions in supply and demand. While consumption of some animal-based products is temporarily rising (e.g., chicken meat, eggs), consumption of other types of meat (e.g., sea animals) is decreasing. Still, the future of the animal protein market looks complex and changing.</blockquote><blockquote>Plant-based meat: If the U.S. and Europe dip into a recession, the business of plant-based companies will probably be disrupted. In China, because of the coronavirus outbreak along with other health threats, consumers&#x2019; willingness to try new plant-based proteins is likely to increase.</blockquote><blockquote>Finally, some practical implications of the pandemic are presented. One is that consumers are likely to be more concerned about obtaining safer and healthier food. Another is that organizations running corporate outreach campaigns should probably consider some strategic changes, focusing less on restaurant and hotel chains and more on grocery chains.</blockquote><blockquote>It should be noted that the situation is evolving rapidly and other factors not considered here may come into play in upcoming weeks.

<p>I do not find math completely boring. If I were stuck in a prison cell I'd happily do math until I expired from a ruptured spline. Insofar as I have escaped prison, I have attempted to escape math too.</p>
<p>Avoiding math was particularly difficult while I earned my bachelor's degree with majors in physics and (a-hem) <strong>pure mathematics</strong>. Undaunted, I found many ways to avoid doing real math while ostensibly doing math.</p>
<p>The lowest-hanging fruit to go unpicked was proofs. Many math classes are nothing but a professor proving a single theorem. We were never tested on anything but the conclusion. Students majoring in math are expected to pay intrinsic interest to these lectures. I daydreamed through them all. A mathematician writing a proof of a theorem is strong Bayesian evidence the theorem is true. Lots of other students watched the professors for errors. Transparency is the best disinfectant. This is good enough for me. With so much transparency, reading the proofs felt redundant, like irradiating my hands and then washing them. I wash my hands of, well, washing my hands.</p>
<p>My favorite method of avoiding math is proof by contradiction. Proof by contradiction assumes a theorem is false and then contradicts itself with a counterexample. It's obscenely dissatisfying.</p>
<p>Alas, some things are not provable by contradiction. This called for last resorts. Unable to do real math, I performed a physics substitution. I  translated the math problem into physics, solved the problem and then translated it back into pure mathematics. In this way, calculus became kinematics, real analysis became electrodynamics, complex analysis became quantum mechanics, group theory became gauge theory and linear algebra became machine learning.</p>
<p>I didn't start gauge theory and machine learning until after I had nearly failed my algebra classes. Oops. Aside from this hiccup, my degree in pure mathematics became a cozy math supplement to my physics degree.</p>
<p>My professors taught me lots of math despite my best efforts to the contrary. For this I am grateful. Math was the second-hardest subject I've ever studied. Some day I hope to be good enough at math that I can work out how to not come across as ""weird"" in an informal social setting.</p>

<h1><span>Part 1: Examples</span></h1>
<p><span>There’s a thing I want to talk about but it’s pretty nebulous so I’m going to start with examples. Feel free to skip ahead to part 2 if you prefer.</span></p>
<h2><span>Example 1: Hot sauce</span></h2>
<p><span>In this r/AmITheAsshole </span><a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/g06ca0/aita_for_trying_to_put_hot_sauce_on_a_dish_my_gf/""><span>post</span></a><span>, a person tries some food their their girlfriend cooked, likes it, but tries another bite with hot sauce. Girlfriend says this “…insults her cooking and insinuates that she doesn’t know how to cook”. </span></p>
<p><span>As objective people not in this fight, we can notice that her cooking is exactly as good as it is whether or not he adds hot sauce. Adding hot sauce reveals information (maybe about him, maybe about the food), but cannot change the facts on the ground. Yet she is treating him like he retroactively made her cooking worse in a way that somehow reflects on her, or made a deliberate attempt to hurt her.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><span>Example 2: Giving a CD back to the library</span></h2>
<p><span>Back when I would get books on CD I would sometimes forget the last one in my drive or car. Since I didn’t use CDs that often, I would find the last CD sometimes months later. To solve this, I would drop the CD in the library book return slot, which, uh, no longer looks like a good solution to me, in part because of the time I did this in front of a friend and she questioned it. Not rudely or anything, just “are you sure that’s safe? Couldn’t the CD snap if something lands wrong?.” I got pretty angry about this, but couldn’t actually deny she had a point, so settled for thinking that if she had violated a friend code by not pretending my action was harmless. I was not dumb enough to say this out loud, but I radiated the vibe and she dropped it.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><span>Example 3: Elizabeth fails to fit in at martial arts </span></h2>
<p><span>A long time ago I went to a martial arts studio. The general classes (as opposed to specialized classes like grappling) were preceded by an optional 45 minute warm up class. Missing the warm up was fine, even if you took a class before and after. Showing up 10 minutes before the general class and doing your own warm ups on the adjacent mats was fine too. What was not fine was doing the specialized class, doing your own warm ups on adjacent maps for the full 45 minutes while the instructor led regular warm ups, and then rejoining for the general class. That was “very insulting to the instructor”.</span></p>
<p><span>This was a problem for me because the regular warm ups </span><i><span>hurt</span></i><span>, in ways that clearly meant they were bad for me (and this is at a place I regularly let people hit me in the head). Theoretically I could have asked the instructor to give me something different, but that is not free and the replacements wouldn’t have been any better, which is not surprising because no one there had the slightest qualification to do personal training or physical therapy. So basically the school wanted me to pretend I was in a world where they were competent to create exercise routines, more competent than I despite having no feedback from my body, and considered not pretending disrespectful to the person leading warm ups.</span></p>
<p><span>Like the hot sauce example, the warm ups were as good as they were regardless of my participation – and they knew that, because they didn’t demand I participate. But me doing my own warm ups broke the illusion of competence they were trying to maintain.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><span>Example 4: Imaginary Self-Help Guru</span></h2>
<p><span>I listened to an interview where the guest was a former self-help guru who had recently shut down his school. Well, I say listened, but I’ve only done the first 25% so far. For that reason this should be viewed less as “this specific real person believes these specific things” and more like  “a character Elizabeth made up in her head inspired by things a real person said…” and. For that reason, I won’t be using his name or linking to the podcast.</span></p>
<p><span>Anyways, the actual person talked about how being a leader put a target on his back and his followers were never happy.  There are indeed a lot of burdens of leadership that are worthy of empathy, but there was an… entitled… vibe to the complaint. Like his work as a leader gave him a right to a life free of criticism.</span></p>
<p><span>If I was going to steel- man him, I’d say that there </span><i><span>are</span></i><span> lots of demands people place on leaders that they shouldn’t, such as “Stop reminding me of my abusive father” or “I’m sad that trade offs exist, fix it”. But I got a vibe </span><span>that the imaginary</span><span> guru was going farther than that; he felt like he was entitled to have his advice </span><i><span>work</span></i><span>, and people telling him it didn’t was taking that away from him, which made it an attack.</span></p>

<h2><span>Example 5: Do I owe MAPLE space for their response?</span></h2>
<p><span>A friend of mine (who has some skin in the meditation game) said things I interpreted as feeling very strongly that:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><a href=""https://acesounderglass.com/2020/04/10/me-and-monastic-academy/""><span>My post on MAPLE</span></a><span> was important and great and should be widely shared.</span></li>
<li><span>I owed MAPLE an opportunity to read my post ahead of time and give me a response to publish alongside it (although I could have declined to publish it if I felt it was sufficiently bad).</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>Their argument, as I understood it at the time, was that even if I linked to a response MAPLE made later, N days worth of people would have read the post and not the response, and that was unfair.</span></p>
<p><span>I think this is sometimes correct- I took an example out of this post even though it required substantial rewrites, because I checked in with the people in question, found they had a different view, and that I didn’t feel sure enough of mine to defend it (full disclosure: I also have more social and financial ties to the group in question than I do to MAPLE).</span></p>
<p><span>I had in fact already reached out to my original contact there to let him know the post was coming and would be negative, and he passed my comment on to the head of the monastery. I didn’t offer to let him see it or respond, but he had an opportunity to ask (what he did suggest is a post in and of itself). This wasn’t enough for my friend- what if my contact was misrepresenting me to the head, or vice versa? I had an obligation to reach out directly to the head (which I had no way of doing beyond the info@ e-mail on their website) and explicitly offer him a pre-read and to read his response.</span></p>
<p><span>[Note: I’m compressing timelines a little. Some of this argument and clarification came in arguments about the principle of the matter after I had already published the post. I did share this with my friend, and changed some things based on their requests. On others I decided to leave it as my impression at the time we argued, on the theory that “if I didn’t understand it after 10 hours of arguing, the chances this correction actually improves my accuracy are slim”. I showed them a near-final draft and they were happy with it]</span></p>
<p><span>I thought about this very seriously. I even tentatively agreed (to my friend) that I would do it. But I sat with it for a day, and it just didn’t feel right. What I eventually identified as the problem was this: MAPLE wasn’t going to be appending my criticism to any of their promotional material. I would be shocked if they linked to me at all. And even if they did it wouldn’t be the equivalent, because my friend was insisting that I proactively seek out their response, where they had never sought out mine, or to the best of my knowledge any of their critics. As far as I know they’ve never included anything negative in their public facing material, despite at least one person making criticism </span><i><span>extremely available </span></i><span>to them. </span></p>
<p><span>If my friend were being consistent (which is not a synonym for “good”) they would insist that MAPLE seek out people’s feedback and post a representative sample somewhere, at a minimum. The good news is: my friend says they’re going to do that next time they’re in touch. What they describe wanting MAPLE to create sounds acceptable to me. Hurray! Balance is restored to The Force! Except… assuming it does happen, why was my post necessary to kickstart this conversation?  My friend could have noticed the absence of critical content on MAPLE’s website at any time. The fact that negative reports trigger a reflex to look for a response and positive self-reports do not is itself a product of treating negative reports as overt antagonism and positive reports as neutral information.</span></p>
<p><span>[If MAPLE does link to my experience in a findable way on their website, I will append whatever they want to my post (clearly marked as coming from them). If they share a link on Twitter or something else transient, I will do the same] </span></p>
<p> </p>
<h1><span>Part 2: Simulacrum</span></h1>
<p><span>My friend </span><a href=""http://benjaminrosshoffman.com/""><span>Ben Hoffman</span></a><span> talks about simulacra a lot, with this rough definition:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>1. First, words were used to maintain shared accounting. We described reality intersubjectively in order to build shared maps, the better to navigate our environment. I say that the food source is over there, so that our band can move towards or away from it when situationally appropriate, or so people can make other inferences based on this knowledge.</span></p>
<p><span>2. The breakdown of naive intersubjectivity – people start taking the shared map as an object to be manipulated, rather than part of their own subjectivity. For instance, I might say there’s a lion over somewhere where I know there’s food, in order to hoard access to that resource for idiosyncratic advantage. Thus, the map drifts from reality, and we start dissociating from the maps we make.</span></p>
<p><span>3. When maps drift far enough from reality, in some cases people aren’t even parsing it as though it had a literal specific objective meaning that grounds out in some verifiable external test outside of social reality. Instead, the map becomes a sort of </span><a href=""http://benjaminrosshoffman.com/actors-and-scribes-words-and-deeds/""><span>command language</span></a><span> for coordinating actions and feelings. “There’s food over there” is perhaps construed as a bid to move in that direction, and evaluated as though it were that call to action. Any argument for or against the implied call to action is conflated with an argument for or against the proposition literally asserted. This is how </span><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9weLK2AJ9JEt2Tt8f/politics-is-the-mind-killer""><span>arguments become soldiers</span></a><span>. Any attempt to simply investigate the literal truth of the proposition is considered at best naive and at worst politically irresponsible.</span><span><br />
</span><span>But since this usage is parasitic on the old map structure that was meant to describe something outside the system of describers, language is still structured in terms of reification and objectivity, so it substantively resembles something with descriptive power, or “aboutness.” For instance, while you cannot acquire a physician’s privileges and social role simply by providing clear evidence of your ability to heal others, those privileges are still justified in terms of pseudo-consequentialist arguments about expertise in healing.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Finally, the pseudostructure itself becomes perceptible as an object that can be manipulated, the pseudocorrespondence breaks down, and all assertions are nothing but moves in an ever-shifting game where you’re trying to think a bit ahead of the others (for positional advantage), but not too far ahead.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span>If that doesn’t make sense, try this anonymous </span><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/fEX7G2N7CtmZQ3eB5/simulacra-and-subjectivity?commentId=FgajiMrSpY9MxTS8b""><span>comment</span></a><span> on the post</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>Level 1: “There’s a lion across the river.” = There’s a lion across the river.<br />
</span><span style=""color:var(--color-neutral-50);"">Level 2: “There’s a lion across the river.” = I don’t want to go (or have other people go) across the river.<br />
</span><span style=""color:var(--color-neutral-50);"">Level 3: “There’s a lion across the river.” = I’m with the popular kids who are too cool to go across the river.<br />
</span><span style=""color:var(--color-neutral-50);"">Level 4: “There’s a lion across the river.” = A firm stance against trans-river expansionism focus grouped well with undecided voters in my constituency.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span>In all five of my examples, people were given information (I like this better with hot sauce, you might break the library’s CD, these exercises hurt me and you are not qualified to fix it, your advice did not fix my problem, I had a miserable time at your retreat), and treated it as a social attack. This is most obvious in the first four, where someone literally says some version of “I feel under attack”, but is equally true in the last one, even though the enforcer was different than the ~victim and was attempting merely to tax criticism, not suppress it entirely. All five have the effect that there is either more conflict or less information in the world.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h1><span>Part 3: But…</span></h1>
<p><span>When I started thinking about this, I wanted a button I could push to make everyone go to level one all the time. It’s not clear that that’s actually a good idea, but even if it was, there is no button, and choosing/pretending to cut off your awareness of higher levels in order to maintain moral purity does you no good. If you refuse to conceive of why someone would tell you things other than to give you information, you leave yourself open to “I’m only telling you this to make you better” abuse. If you refuse to believe that people would lie except out of ignorance, you’ll trust when you shouldn’t. If you refuse to notice how people are communicating with others, you will be blindsided when they coordinate on levels you don’t see. </span></p>
<p><span>But beating them at their own game doesn’t work either, because the enemy was never them, it was the game, which you are still playing. You can’t socially maneuver your way into a less political world. In particular, it’s a recent development that I would have noticed my friend’s unilateral demand for fairness as in fact tilted towards MAPLE. In a world where no one notices things like that, positive reviews of programs become overrepresented.</span></p>
<p><span>I don’t have a solution to this.  The best I can do right now is try to feed systems where level one is valued and higher levels are discussed openly.  “How do I find those?” you might ask. I don’t know. If you do, my email address is elizabeth – at – <a href=""https://acesounderglass.com/"">[original domain]</a> and I’d love to hear from you. You can also book a </span><a href=""https://acesounderglass.com/2020/04/18/talk-to-me-for-an-hour-2/""><span>time to talk to me for an hour</span></a><span>. What I have are a handful of 1:1 relationships where we have spent years building trust to get to the point where “I think you’re being a coward” is treated as genuine information, not a social threat, and mostly the other person has made the first move. </span></p>
<p><span>The pieces of advice I do have are:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>If someone says they want honest feedback, err on the side of giving it to them. They are probably lying, but that’s their problem (unless they’re in a position to make it yours, in which case think harder about this).</span></li>
<li><span>Figure out what you need to feel secure as someone confirms your worst fears about yourself and ask for it, even if it’s weird, even if it seems like an impossibly big ask. People you are compatible with will want to build towards that (not everyone who doesn’t is abusive or even operating in bad faith- but if you can’t start negotiations on this I’d be very surprised if you’re compatible).</span></li>
<li><span>Be prepared for some sacrifices, especially in the congeniality department. People who are good at honesty under a climate that punishes it are not going to come out unscathed.</span></li>

<p>Background on this in <a href=""http://reasonableapproximation.net/2020/03/29/chris-masterjohn-on-coronavirus-part-1.html"">part one</a>.</p>

<h3>General info: Interferon</h3>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"">Interferon</a> is an antiviral that our immune system naturally releases when it detects invasion. But SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (the virus that causes MERS) manage to avoid this response. The trigger is the presence of double-stranded RNA, which viruses need but our own cells don't. (We make single-stranded RNA from DNA, and then proteins from single-stranded RNA. We never need to copy our RNA. But viruses do need to copy their RNA, and apparently that means viral RNA needs to be double-stranded.) SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV hide their double-stranded RNA inside ""double-membrane vesicles"" to avoid detection.</p>

<p>They also have a bunch of other ways to limit production of interferon, and on top of that they limit the response to the interferon that does get produced.</p>

<p>This all sounds like ""so we should ramp up interferon"". But that's probably a bad idea. During early stages of the virus, interferon is suppressed, so the virus can replicate quickly. But when the infection is established, macrophages generate a lot of interferon, leading to a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine_release_syndrome"">cytokine storm</a>. In a <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4752723/"">mouse trial</a>, deleting the genes for the main interferon receptor made the subjects very resistant to SARS-CoV, but very vulnerable to mouse hepatitis virus and influeza A, compared to normal mice. (0% died to a dose of SARS-CoV<sup><a href=""#fn:mouse-trial-sars-cov"">1</a></sup> that killed 85% of normal mice; but 100% died to a dose of the other viruses that killed 10-20% of normal mice.)</p>

<p>(Question: ""During the replication of the virus, macrophages are recruited to the lung"". These are what release the interferon. What is a macrophage and what is recruiting them and why?)</p>

<p>We don't yet know that any of this applies to SARS-CoV-2 as well, but it seems likely. So high levels of interferon might be slightly helpful in early stages, but make later stages much worse. Thus, Chris recommends avoiding them.</p>

<p>(Question: LW user CellBioGuy <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/nRX7uwT2wNvvmd2Yd/coronavirus-justified-key-insights-thread#comment-hRzw8sejgnb5C8C7B"">is bullish on</a> inhaled interferon pretreatment, which I take it means ""inhaling interferon before the disease gets bad"". Does this square with Chris' recommendations? It wouldn't surprise me if inhaling interferon increases your levels in the short term but not the long term, which is exactly what we want. On the other hand, he links a paper whose abstract says SARS-CoV-2 ""is much more sensitive [than SARS-CoV] to type I interferon pretreatment"", so maybe this is just a case of ""generalizing from SARS-CoV didn't work here"".)</p>

<p>On April 25, Chris <a href=""https://chrismasterjohnphd.com/covid-19/new-evidence-that-interferon-can-be-harmful-in-covid-19"">wrote more about this</a> on his mailing list. My own summary: in hamsters infected with SARS-CoV-2<sup><a href=""#fn:hamster-trial"">2</a></sup>, eliminating the type 1 interferon response increased the amount of virus in various body parts including the lungs; but dramatically reduced lung damage. Chris notes that this is a bit weird, but takes it as supporting his hypothesis, and I'm inclined to agree.</p>

<h3>Every-day optional add-on: Garlic or stabilized allicin</h3>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allicin"">Allicin</a> is the thing we care about here, garlic is just one way to get it. Garlic doesn't actually contain any, though. Garlic contains alliin. Alliin is converted to allicin when the garlic is crushed and left at room temperature in the open air for ten minutes.</p>

<p>(Who decided to name those things with an edit distance of one, and how do we stop them from naming anything ever again?)</p>

<p>Alternatively, we can mix garlic powder with water, and let that sit at room temperature in the open air for ten minutes. That gives us a more reliable dose, since garlic cloves vary in size. Or we can just take stabilized allicin supplements, which is a still more reliable dose. Most garlic extract won't work, and ""potential allicin"" is unreliable. Meals containing garlic won't work, because allicin isn't robust to heat or acids.</p>

<p>180mg allicin daily makes people <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6465033/"">less likely to get colds</a>. (I note that Chris here seems more confident than the authors of that review, who only found one study matching their inclusion criteria and who say at different times that the evidence is ""poor-quality"" and ""moderate"". Looking at the excluded studies, two seem worth noting. Both were excluded because they grouped colds and influenza together. <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12718222"">Andrianova 2003</a> found that a specific brand of garlic tablets ""allicor"" reduced morbidity from acute respiratory diseases 1.7-fold. So that seems to support Chris' recommendation. <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22280901"">Nantz 2012</a> used aged garlic extract, and found that it didn't reduce the incidence of (colds + flu) but did reduce the number and severity of symptoms. It's not clear to me whether aged garlic extract even contains allicin, but these results seem a little confusing to me whether it does or not.)</p>

<p>We also see antiviral effects in vitro against six different viruses: ""herpes simples virus type 1, herpes simplex virus type 2, parainfluenza virus type 3, vaccinia virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, and human rhinovirus type 2"". It seems to work by damaging the lipid envelope of those viruses. So it might also work against coronaviruses, which also have a lipid envelope.</p>

<p>Separately, allicin has antibacterial effects, which work by the same mechanism as zinc and copper inhibit SARS-CoV enzymes, so maybe it also inhibits those enzymes. (Note, this is not the same mechanism as how copper surfaces destroy SARS-CoV.) And it inhibits papain, so maybe it also inhibits papain-like proteases. (It sounds like papain-like protease 2 could be targeted by both these effects, and there are other papain-like proteases that could only get targeted by the second?)</p>

<p>Chris recommends this as an optional daily add-on, because although it's never been tested directly against coronaviruses, it's plausible and seems to be safe.</p>

<h3>If you get sick, optional add-on: Echinacea</h3>

<p>I've never heard of this. Apparently <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echinacea"">it's a herb</a>. It ""<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16678640"">has been used for the common cold</a>"", which isn't saying much (what hasn't?) but the citation suggests it was also at least somewhat effective. But this seems to be the only evidence Chris provides that it has any positive effects at all; Wikipedia is skeptical.</p>

<p>The mechanism of its effect seems to be boosting the immune system, so we might worry that it does so by increasing interferon. But instead it seems to work by increasing ""inducible nitric oxide synthase"" (iNOS). That doesn't seem to be protective against contracting SARS, but in mice it helps protect against the long-term damage that SARS does to the lungs.</p>

<p>Chris thinks this is less important than all of the preceding compounds, because ""there is no clear evidence echinacea will offer specific protection against COVID-19"". He no longer thinks it's safe long-term (though he hasn't updated the in-depth section of his report to reflect that), so he recommends only taking it when you get sick.</p>

<h3>Everyday optional add-on: Vitamin C</h3>

<p>Vitamin C supplements seem to prevent colds, but not necessarily cure them. Intravenous vitamin C reduced mortality of acute respiratory distress syndrome by half; but none of those patients had SARS. Studies have shown conflicting effects of vitamin C on interferon levels, variously increasing and decreasing it.</p>

<p>Chris recommends getting enough vitamin C ""to support normal immune function"", which means taking supplements if and only if you don't get enough from your diet. He thinks the chance of it increasing interferon is too risky to take high doses.</p>

<h3>No longer recommended? N-Acetyl-Cysteine</h3>

<p>In the first version of the report, Chris considered this an optional add-on. He no longer includes it in his list of recommendations, but the sections where he explained his recommendation are still in the report, unchanged. I'm not sure what's up with that.</p>

<p>Another thing that I'm not sure what's up with. In one section, Chris says: Normally we get cysteine by eating protein. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcysteine"">NAC</a> helps us get more <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cysteine"">cysteine</a> into our cells, and the extra cysteine is good for the immune system and lung health. In another section, he says NAC ""is a precursor to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione"">glutathione</a>, which is critical for lung function."" He's not very detailed about either of these claims, so I'm not sure how to put them together, and a quick glance at wikipedia doesn't really help. (There's totally room in my lack-of-understanding for them both to be true, it's just a bit weird that we have two different descriptions of its effects.)</p>

<p>Apart from being generally good for the lungs, the reason for recommending it - if he does recommend it - seems to be a single case where large amounts of NAC helped someone to recover from pneumonia caused by H1N1. There's no reason to think it might help prevent COVID-19, but it might help mitigate the damage.</p>

<h3>Limit: Vitamin A</h3>

<p>Vitamin A is vital to the immune system, and you shouldn't get deficient. But its active metabolite is all-trans retinoic acid. In many rat studies, that's increased ACE2: ""in the heart of rats whose blood pressure was raised by constricting their aortas, in the heart and kidney of spontaneously hypertensive rats, in the kidney of rats with glomerular sclerosis (to much higher levels than even healthy control rats), and in rat tubular epithelial cells subject to hypoxia-repurfusion."" Since that effect seems fairly consistent, there's a significant risk that increased levels of vitamin A would increase levels of ACE2, which (as discussed in part 1) seems likely bad. So Chris recommends getting only enough vitamin A to avoid deficiency.</p>

<p>(Question: how easy is it to avoid publication bias / confirmation bias / etc. here? If some people found situations where ACE2 didn't get raised by Vitamin A, would that result have been published and would Chris have found it? He does mention studies like that for vitamin D, so that's at least evidence for yes and yes.)</p>

<h3>Limit with caveats: Vitamin D</h3>

<p>Like vitamin A, vitamin D runs the risk of increasing ACE2 levels. We have three rat studies supporting this, two rat studies contradicting it, and one human study contradicting it.</p>

<p>The supporting rat studies show that: ""Calcitriol, the active metabolite of vitamin D, increases ACE2 mRNA and protein in rat pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells treated with lipopolysaccharide, synergizes with diabetes to increase ACE2 protein in the renal tubules of rats, and in the brains of both hypertensive and healthy rats.""</p>

<p>Of the contradicting evidence, the human study and one of the rat studies looked at serum ACE2, i.e. ACE2 which has been shed from cells and is circulating (I guess in the bloodstream). Serum ACE2 won't help the virus gain entry to cells, and might help protect against it. (No citation or explanation for this, but I guess the reasoning is that if the relevant part of the virus binds to serum ACE2, it won't subsequently be able to bind to ACE2 on the cell wall.) Serum ACE2 might not correlate with docked ACE2. Additionally, the rat study showed that vitamin D depletion had no effect on serum ACE2, but that doesn't mean an abundance of vitamin D would also have no effect; and the human study only showed a statistically significant difference in people with stage 5 kidney disease (with less severe kidney disease, the difference wasn't statistically significant; in healthy controls there was no difference).</p>

<p>The final rat study was looking at injury response of rat kidneys; the injury in question would normally increase ACE2 levels but vitamin D (or at least calcidiol, its partially activated metabolite) reduces that effect. But this seems to be caused by vitamin D making the kidneys more resilient to injury, not by directly suppressing ACE2. So it probably isn't relevant here.</p>

<p>Weighing up, vitimin D seems likely to increase ACE2, and Chris recommends against supplementing it (but still against becoming deficient).</p>

<p><strong>Except that</strong> based on a more recent study, Chris <a href=""https://chrismasterjohnphd.com/covid-19/update-on-vitamin-d-and-covid-19-using-the-first-observational-study-released"">now recommends</a> supplementing ""to shoot for a 25(OH)D of 30 ng/mL"" (more info at the link). He still recommends not going higher than that. He sent that to his mailing list on April 24th, and said he'd update the report ""tomorrow""; as of this writing he has not done so.</p>

<p>(Note: He says 900 IU/day is sufficient for the average person to reach that level. By comparison, different institutions generally recommend daily intakes around <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D#Recommended_levels"">600 IU/day</a>, and for the past few years I've been supplementing with 3000 IU on weekdays.)</p>

<h3>Limit: Calcium</h3>

<p>And balance it with phosphorus. There's a complex system keeping them balanced in the blood, and they often have opposite effects. Notably, a high calcium:phosphorus ratio suppresses <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroblast_growth_factor_23"">fibroblast growth factor 23</a>, and a low calcium:phosphorus ratio increases it. FGF23 suppresses ACE2, so a high calcium:phosphorus ratio might increase ACE2. Chris recommends limiting calcium supplements to 1000 mg/day, and matching supplemental calcium with supplemental phosphorus 1:1.</p>

<h3>Avoid: Pelargonium Sidoides</h3>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelargonium_sidoides"">This</a> is also called Umcka. I don't think I've previously heard of it under either name. It has many of the same components as elderberry, but only a small amount of caffeic acid. Caffeic acid was what gave us most reason to think elderberry would work, so Umcka seems inferior to elderberry.</p>

<p>Umcka does have some antiviral effects, including against <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_coronavirus_229E"">HCoV-229E</a>, but the mechanism for that is unclear. In cell cultures it increaes iNOS like echinacea; but also interferon, so if that generalizes it would be risky to take. It also increases <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrophil"">neutrophil</a> activity; those are part of the immune system, so naively we might think that was a good thing, but high neutrophil counts seem to make SARS worse.</p>

<p>So basically this seems like it offers nothing we can't get from elderberry and echinacea, and is too risky. So Chris recommends avoiding it.</p>

<h3>Avoid: Honeybee Propolis</h3>

<p>This hasn't been found to have significant direct antiviral properties against any viruses. It increases interferon responses in mice and chickens, so it may be somewhat helpful against some viruses, but it's too risky to use here. Chris recommends avoiding it.</p>

<h3>Avoid: Monolaurin</h3>

<p>Monolaurin seems to damage lipid envelopes, as well as the membrane of cells without cell walls, so SARS-CoV-2 is probably vulnerable to it. But so are human T cells. The risk of impairing those seems unacceptably high, and Chris recommends avoiding monolaurin.</p>

<p>There's an argument that it hurts only pathogens ""because it is effective against yeast and the bacteria that cause bacterial vaginosis, but not against lactobacillus"", but Chris thinks that's just because <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactobacillus"">lactobacillus</a> has a cell wall, and there are probiotics which don't have anything like that which would probably be vulnerable too.</p>

<p>(I think the idea that this would only hurt pathogens seems absurd, but what do I know. The <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20008774"">citation</a> for that clause doesn't seem to present the argument, so I'm not sure who's making it or if Chris is representing it accurately, but people have been to occasionally say absurd things.)</p>

      <p>In the first reference to this study, Chris says this was a dose of SARS-CoV-2. I think that was just a typo/brain fart. Though actually, it wasn't SARS-CoV either, it was <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17222058"">MA15</a> which is a strain of SARS-CoV adapted to infect mice. Chris doesn't mention this, but to be fair the paper calls it SARS-CoV. I guess the idea is that it's a close enough model as we ever really get in this kind of work? An alternative is <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1797474/"">mice engineered to express human ACE2</a>. <a href=""#fnref:mouse-trial-sars-cov"">↩</a></p>

      <p>This was actual SARS-CoV-2. Unlike mouse ACE2, hamster ACE2 is similar enough to human ACE2 that they can get a severe infection going from the regular virus. <a href=""#fnref:hamster-trial"">↩</a></p>

Now the question arises: how UAP will affect the future of humanity, and especially, the probability of the global catastrophic risks? To answer this question, we assume that the Nimitz case in 2004 was real and we will suggest a classification of the possible explanations of the phenomena. The first level consists of mundane explanations: hardware glitches, malfunction, hoaxes and lies. The second level involves explanations which are not changing completely our model of the world, but only updating it: new military tech, large psyop operation or new physical effect like ball lightning. The third level of explanations requires a complete overhaul of our world model and includes a large set of fantastic hypothesis: alien starships, interdimensional beings, glitches in the matrix, projections from the collective unconsciousness, Boltzmann brain&#x2019;s experiences etc. The higher is the level of the hypothesis, the less probable it is, but the bigger is its consequences for possible global catastrophic risks. Thus, &#x201C;integrating&#x201D; over the field of all possible explanations, we find that UAP increases catastrophic risks. Technological progress increases our chances of direct confrontation with the phenomena. If the phenomenon has intelligence, the change of its behavior could be unexpected after we pass some unknown threshold. But we could lower the risks if we assume some reasonable policy of escaping confrontations.&#xA0;</p><p>The whole article is here: <a href=""https://philpapers.org/rec/TURUAG"">https://philpapers.org/rec/TURUAG</a></p>",avturchin,avturchin,avturchin,

Competence gives you confidence - where you&#x2019;re competent and confident, you don&#x2019;t have fear of inadequacy. And if you don&#x2019;t learn fast because you&#x2019;re afraid of feedback (because you&#x2019;re afraid of inadequacy), you&#x2019;ll not get better, leaving you relatively incompetent and afraid of inadequacy. &#x1F5D8;</p><p>A thing about sex recently clicked from several sources:</p><ul><li>Being high and talking with a certain sergal,</li><li>plus reading a <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/duncan.sabien/posts/3280464855321542"">Facebook thing by Duncan</a>,</li><li>plus listening to John Vervaecke&#x2019;s series <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLND1JCRq8Vuh3f0P5qjrSdb5eC1ZfZwWJ"">Awakening from the Meaning Crisis</a>. (One of the episodes talks about fixed/growth mindset, but I can&#x2019;t find it right now. You should go watch the whole series anyway, it&#x2019;s awesome.)</li></ul><p>During sex, I have a background fear of &#x201C;what if I can&#x2019;t bring them to orgasm&#x201D;. I want my partner to enjoy it as well, and I want to reciprocate, and I would feel bad if they bring me to orgasm but I can&#x2019;t bring them to orgasm. So, I hurry and try hard to bring them to orgasm, because I am not confident of my sexual skill. Orgasm is cool, but the sex before orgasm is also cool. Sex that doesn&#x2019;t feel hurried and where you can take your time and stretch out pleasure. But, so far, in like 90% of the sex I&#x2019;ve had so far I had the thought &#x201C;aaaa sex aaaa gotta perform and be good enough and hurry and give them an orgasm aaaa&#x201D;, somewhere in the background. In that kind of environment, you don&#x2019;t get a lot of learning done.</p><p>Say you&#x2019;re learning how to play the violin. We know lots about learning. CFAR&#x2019;s handbook (which I think is still not publicly readable) has a lot of useful stuff on it. Things that make learning work well include:</p><ul><li>You need to <strong>learn the basics</strong> first. You don&#x2019;t start by playing Vivaldi&#x2019;s Four Seasons. You start by playing one note until you get that one note at least 90% right: holding the violin correctly, not having the bow screech, not touching the strings that shouldn&#x2019;t ring, holding the tone for as long as required without it fluctuating (unless you want it to).</li><li>You need <strong>feedback</strong>, and the faster the feedback loop is, the better. If you play the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRxofEmo3HA"">Four Seasons</a> and by Summer you start holding the bow wrong, your violin tutor will immediately stop you and tell you. The tutor won&#x2019;t wait the remaining 20 minutes to tell you that starting with Summer they stopped enjoying your performance and just hoped you&#x2019;d get it over with soon.</li></ul><p>So. When having sex, I hurry because I worry I might be unable bring my partner to orgasm, making the experience less than optimal. And I never really get learning done because I always hurry because I worry I can&#x2019;t bring my partner to orgasm, which I worry about because I never learned enough to be confident in my ability to do that. &#x1F5D8;</p><p>With the next couple of partners I have, I think I&#x2019;ll ask if we could get some learning done. As in, play the Four Seasons, and tell each other if we&#x2019;re off tune or in the wrong rhytm or need to tune the strings. And ask proactively, too. If you&#x2019;re scared that holding the violin wrong makes you a not-good-enough violin player forever, you&#x2019;ll be holding it wrong until you chance upon the right way by stochastic gradient descent, with the loss function being &#x201C;the partner&#x2019;s body language looks happy&#x201D;. That also converges (if you&#x2019;re good at reading people), but slower.</p><p>Go learn about growth/fixed mindset if you haven&#x2019;t yet. I&#x2019;ve known about the concept for a while, but somehow I never thought of applying it to this area until now. And I suspect a lot of the places where I&#x2019;m not competent right now are also places where I have fixed mindset but haven&#x2019;t yet realized it or addressed it.

<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_planning"">Central
planning</a> generally hasn't worked out very well for countries, and
essentially the whole world has moved over to 

<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_economy"">markets</a>.  So
why are there strong calls for governments to run disaster response,
instead of leaving that to markets?  For example, governments
directly:



<ul>

<li><p>distributing food and water after a hurricane or
earthquake.</p></li>

<li><p><a href=""https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/04/army-corp-engineers-hospitals-coronavirus/610195/"">building
out</a> and running new covid-19 hospital facilities, instead of
agreeing to fund treatment.</p></li>

<li><p>negotiating with foreign factories to produce more masks and
arranging importation, instead of announcing they'll pay some elevated
price to anyone who can supply them.</p></li>

</ul>





</p><p>

Normally, everyone is the best authority on what they need.  We have a
wide range of requirements and preferences, and competition means
there are high rewards for resolving mismatches between what people
want and what's available.  People are also normally able to project
their needs out into the future, because the world changes relatively
slowly.

</p>

<p>

Once a disaster strikes, both of these invert.  Basic needs become
much more important, and these vary a lot less between people: we need
food, water, shelter.  In the current crisis we're very short on N95
masks, and while doctors probably do have opinions on Ambu vs
Teleflex, mostly we just need a lot more of them, quickly.
Additionally, people are dealing with something where they don't have
much experience, and aren't going to be as good at planning around.

</p>

<p>

Then you can potentially get the upside of having professionals whose
job it is to work full time on preparation, figuring out what
disasters are likely and how we're going to want to respond.  This is
not something the US has been handling well, but perhaps when this is
over it will be easier to communicate the need for funding this kind
of ""we probably don't need it, but if we do it's super important""
work.

</p>

<p>

I don't think this is the only way to handle disasters: if law and
custom allow prices to freely move in response to changes in what's
available and what people are buying, then price signals are still a
very strong tool.  Both market and centralized approaches have
downsides in crisis situations, with markets magnifying existing
inequality, and centralization magnifying existing government
incompetence.  But people all suddenly wanting the same few things
they didn't anticipate they would want dramatically levels the playing
field between the two approaches.

Critical feedback is very welcome.</em></p><p><em>Thanks to Sam Hilton, Tim Colbourn and anonymous others for input on previous drafts.</em></p><h2>Summary</h2><p>Effectively tackling COVID-19 will require rapidly scaling up the production of diagnostic tests, pharmaceutical treatments and vaccines. In each case, preparations for large-scale manufacturing, such as building factories, are typically delayed until the product is proven safe and effective. This makes sense from a commercial perspective, but incurs great costs in terms of lives lost and damage to the economy. </p><p>There are several potential solutions, but the most promising appears to be &#x201C;option-based guarantees&#x201D;. In essence, the government commits to paying a proportion of the manufacturer&#x2019;s preparation costs should the product turn out not to be viable. (If the product is viable, it can be sold as normal.) This reduces the risk to the company while maintaining an incentive to produce a high-quality product quickly and at scale. </p><h2>The problem</h2><p>The UK, like most of the world, faces an urgent need for increased COVID-19 testing capacity. As more people become infected and recover, large-scale screening for past exposure (antibody tests) will be necessary, but the shortage is especially acute for tests of active infection (&#x201C;swab&#x201D; tests). The government recognises this need and has <u><a href=""https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/878121/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-strategy.pdf"">set a target</a></u> of 100,000 tests per day &#x2013; a combined figure for antibody and swab tests &#x2013; by the end of April. While this increase is welcome, safely bringing the country out of lockdown could require far more widespread swab testing, potentially as many as 10 million tests a day. Post-lockdown policy is still being developed so this may become the strategy within a few weeks. The UK should prepare now by deciding how market forces can be leveraged to rapidly scale up testing. </p><p>A long-term solution to the crisis will involve effective pharmaceutical treatments or vaccines (ideally both). Promising candidates have been identified, but most will take at least several months to complete Phase 3 studies &#x2013; perhaps less if <u><a href=""https://academic.oup.com/jid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/infdis/jiaa152/5814216"">&#x201C;human challenge trials&#x201D;</a></u> are permitted. Since many products will not prove viable, companies have little incentive to invest in production facilities before the product achieves regulatory approval. Thus, scaling up production is likely to add a few more months to the overall timeline, costing thousands of lives and billions of pounds of lost GDP in the UK alone &#x2013; far more than the cost of preparing to manufacture products that do not end up reaching the market. </p><h2>Potential solutions</h2><p>There are several ways to address this problem.</p><p><strong>1. Prizes</strong></p><p>The government could offer financial rewards for solutions to supply shortages. For example, companies could compete to offer the best idea for rapidly scaling up vaccines, and a contract to produce them could be part of the prize. By only paying out for the best solution (and perhaps not any, if certain criteria are unmet), this can be a fairly cheap option that incentivises innovation. However, there is necessarily a substantial delay between announcing and awarding the prize; and because the &#x201C;losers&#x201D; get nothing, there may not be adequate financial incentive to participate. </p><p><strong>2. Public-private partnerships</strong></p><p>PPPs can be an effective means of achieving social objectives, such as building infrastructure, by sharing the risk between government and private companies. However, they generally take a long time to negotiate and implement. Unless this process can be greatly accelerated, they are unlikely to be sufficient to ensure the most urgent needs are met in the current situation.</p><p><strong>3. Direct purchase orders</strong></p><p>The government could pre-order tests, pharmaceuticals and vaccines directly, well before efficacy or safety is established. This would legally guarantee that producers have a market and that the company will supply the product, thereby reducing risk to both parties.</p><p>However, this requires the government to first identify suppliers and producers, negotiate prices, and make orders. The process for governmental purchasing is complex, and purchasing something from a new vendor, or purchasing products not shown to be safe, will potentially be a violation of the UK&#x2019;s public procurement policy. It is also likely to be wasteful as many final products will be unused, and it gives little incentive for producers to improve quality, speed, or cost-effectiveness through innovation. </p><p><strong>4. Option-based guarantees</strong></p><p>A new approach is for governments to enter into agreements with companies using <u><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Put_option"">&#x201C;put&#x201D; options</a></u>. A &#x201C;put&#x201D; (as in &#x201C;put up for sale&#x201D;) gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to sell an asset at a specified price, by (or on) a specified date, to the provider of the put. So the government could supply a put option giving companies the right to sell certain items (e.g. vaccine factories, drugs, or diagnostic tests) to the government for a certain percentage of the cost of making them. Because there is no requirement to exercise the put, companies could sell viable products as normal, and would only use the option if their product turns out to be non-viable.</p><p>For example, suppose a manufacturer wishes to produce 100 million of a new type of test, but is delaying production because the product is currently being evaluated. They could approach the government, which could agree to provide a put option for, say, 90% of costs, capped at the company&apos;s initial project cost estimate. If the test is found viable, the company would not exercise the option, the government would pay nothing, and the company would be able to sell the tests normally to the NHS and others. If found non-viable, however, the company would have an incentive to stop production and exercise their option. At that point, a financial audit of costs would take place, and the government would accept delivery of any items purchased, built, and/or produced in exchange for 90% of costs. A further independent evaluation might be useful to resolve disputes about reasonableness of costs.</p><p>This approach has a number of advantages. </p><ol><li>Commercial companies can continue to use traditional, non-governmental methods for financing and constructing a product without any government supervision.</li><li>Companies will be willing to take a larger risk in manufacturing not-yet-proven technologies, because the costs (to the company) of failure are reduced. This incentivises starting production earlier.</li><li>Both haste and high quality are still incentivised through normal market mechanisms: being the first and/or the best product on the market will increase sales and therefore profit. </li><li>Compared to some alternatives, it is relatively cheap.</li><li>It could potentially be implemented quickly &#x2013;&#xA0;a very important consideration in the current circumstances, especially for diagnostics.</li></ol><h2>Recommendation</h2><p>Overall, guarantees based on put options seem to show the most promise. When the viability of the final product is uncertain, they provide a relatively quick, low-cost way of incentivising the rapid production of new technologies. However, options 1&#x2013;3 are also worth exploring further, and the optimal approach (or combination of approaches) may vary among products, time periods, and companies. For example:</p><ul><li>Prizes could work &#x2013; perhaps alongside other incentives &#x2013; when innovative solutions are likely to be needed, such as point-of-care tests for active infection, new vaccines, or new methods of scaling up production. </li><li>PPP could be appropriate for less urgent and fairly low-risk products. Antibody tests, and drugs that are very likely to be used but will not run out soon, may fall into this category. </li><li>A direct purchase order for a certain number of a certain diagnostic test could be effective if the safety, accuracy, cost and quantity required are known, the company is trusted, and the paperwork can be done quickly. This may be less risky than hoping a company will respond to financial incentives.</li><li>A put option on production facilities (not final products) could be the best alternative for diagnostics, drugs and vaccines that are promising but whose viability, large-scale manufacturing methods and/or quantity required are substantially uncertain. </li></ul><p>Over the coming weeks and months, making the right choices could save thousands of lives in the UK and millions around the world, while enabling economies and communities to reopen. </p><h2>Annex 1: Potential variations on standard put options</h2><h4><strong>Declining payout</strong></h4><p>The payout for the put options could be declining over time, so that the payment is, say, 95% at the outset, and declines by 1% per month. This will incentivise companies to exit as soon as possible if they think the project will fail.</p><h4><strong>Priced contracts</strong></h4><p>The government could decide to charge for the contracts, to dissuade unqualified or undercapitalised companies from taking huge immediate risks with small probabilities of paying off.</p><h4><strong>Early-ending bonus</strong></h4><p>Alternatively or additionally, there could be payments for ending the contract early. In this case, the government might refund a portion of the initial payment or pay some fixed amount if the company decides to end the option without exercising it. This would create another incentive for companies to move quickly, and reduce uncertainty and risk on the government&#x2019;s side.</p><h2>Annex 2: Key questions about option-based guarantees</h2><p><strong>Q1: Isn&apos;t this a giveaway to corporations? </strong></p><p>A: Yes, but in a sense it is a minimal giveaway. It does not subsidise companies to undertake projects that they expect cannot succeed, but does allow them to move forward schedules for production. Under the circumstances, it seems worthwhile.</p><p><strong>Q2: Isn&apos;t this wasteful? </strong></p><p>A: Yes, it is nearly certain that some items produced will not be viable, so the government will pay for unused products. However, the companies have an incentive not to spend more than needed, since they recover only part of the costs; and most importantly, the successful products will be available far faster. (The guaranteed percentage of costs can be adjusted to reach the desired trade-off between avoiding waste and hastening development of the needed product.)</p><p>The government may also be able to reduce the costs of the program by reselling some items: for example, a plant designed to manufacture an ineffective vaccine could eventually be adapted to produce an approved vaccine. There have been intermittent shortages of other vaccines, pharmaceuticals and tests, so excess capacity may not be entirely wasted.</p><p><strong>Q3: Won&apos;t there be fraud or unnecessarily high costs?</strong></p><p>A: There is a risk that some companies will try to take advantage of the programme. The put options, however, will pay less than the cost, so there is a reduced risk that companies will attempt to participate if they do not think the product has a reasonable chance of success. (Again, the right balance can be struck by adjusting the guaranteed percentage.)</p><p>For subcontracting, the structure of the payout means that the company, not the government, takes on the risk that costs will be considered excessive, so they have incentives to ensure they are not overpaying.</p><p><strong>Q4: Won&#x2019;t safety and quality suffer?</strong></p><p>A: With less &#x201C;skin in the game&#x201D;, there may be a reduced incentive for companies to be successful. But if a product is viable, they will not want to exercise the put option, and they will have the same incentive to ensure quality and safety as they would otherwise.</p><p><strong>Q5: How do you ensure the final product is affordable?</strong></p><p>A: Put options do not ensure the final test, drug or vaccine is available at a reasonable price, but nor do they preclude price controls. This is an important but entirely separate issue that applies equally to products developed through other means. It is worth noting that, while the product must be cheap enough to roll out at massive scale, the price must also be high enough to reimburse the costs of constructing the production facilities.</p>",DerekF,derekf,DerekF,

But I personally find it a bit awkward to do a video call when I don't have anything in particular to talk about. In real life, lulls in conversation could be filled with eating, or talking a walk and appreciating the scenery. In a videocall, there's either awkward silence, or I start using facebook or something and then get distracted.</p><p>Zoom calls also work less well for large parties. If you want the feeling of wandering through a house, listening in on various conversations and joining in, or spontaneously playing a simple game, I've found video calls a poor substitute. Zoom works best for smaller conversations with clear goals, or very structured conversations. (<a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4kD2yx3ZjToSj9zhH/holiday-pitch-reflecting-on-covid-and-connection"">Seder worked well</a> because it was ""turn based"")</p><p>What works much better IMO is some kind of low-key game going on in the background – something just complicated enough to let me fidget with it, without becoming the Main Activity which distracts from actually talking to friends.</p><p>There are various low-key games that may work for people. But there's a particular quality of Minecraft, and similar world-sims, that feel less like we're playing a game, and more like we're just hanging out in a world.&nbsp;</p><p>What are the best tools for <i>that?</i></p><p>This post began as a response to ""<a href=""https://www.lessestwrong.com/posts/ejFTPGHxetJfmfYfz/what-are-the-best-online-tools-for-meetups-and-meetings"">What are the Best Online Tools For Meetups and Meetings</a>"". It turned out to be pretty extensive, and I thought I'd make it a full post. It currently compares four apps. I may update it as I try more.</p><p>This post currently compares four apps: <a href=""http://minecraft.net/"">Minecraft</a>, <a href=""https://hubs.mozilla.com/#/"">Mozilla Hubs</a>, <a href=""https://altvr.com/"">AltspaceVR</a>, and <a href=""https://town.siempre.io/"">Online Town</a>. I may update it as I try more.</p><p>Each app has some different strengths, and costs. In a nutshell:</p><ul><li><a href=""https://town.siempre.io/""><strong>Online Town</strong></a><strong> </strong>is my favorite for casual online ""parties"", where you want to feel like you're in a house wandering into different rooms, chatting spontaneously with people and forming impromptu conversations. It's a 2d pixel world you can walk around in, videochatting with people nearby. It lives in a browser that doesn't require a download or login.</li><li><a href=""https://hubs.mozilla.com/""><strong>Mozilla Hubs</strong></a> is similar to Online Town, but in 3d. It has many more features, but it's also a bit more complex, and people who aren't familiar with 3D video games may find it harder to use. It can be used via desktop browser, or via VR headset.</li><li><a href=""https://altvr.com/""><strong>AltspaceVR</strong></a> is similar to Mozilla Hubs, but a) requires an app download, and b) basically requires a VR headset (it also has a Windows app, but I would only recommend it for people who have VR headsets and want an immersive VR experience).</li><li><a href=""https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/""><strong>Minecraft</strong></a><strong> </strong>is a fully featured virtual world. It costs $30 (the other three apps are free). It doesn't come with its own audio chat (but can easily be combined with other voice chat services). You get a fully featured world where you can build a house together, explore cool environments, interact with plants and animals, etc. Unlike the previous options it doesn't have ""proximity chat"". It works better if you're interacting with a smallish group of people, who can all hear each other and participate in a single conversation.</li></ul><p>I think there are many other video games that work similarly to Minecraft (for instance, Animal Crossing <a href=""https://www.penny-arcade.com/news/post/2020/03/25/bellwether"">has been getting some press</a> as a ""coronavirus virtual refuge""), but I'm not as familiar with them. This post is essentially comparing the first three options vs ""Minecraft and other similar video games.""</p><h2>Key Considerations</h2><p><strong>Accessibility, vs features</strong></p><p>Some apps just require a url, and immediately drop you into a party. Others make you create an account, or sign in, which creates awkward friction. If you want to host a large online party, it matters a lot that you can invite friends and that they can invite friends organically. If those friends have to stop to download a new app... they probably won't. A url they can just click on is much better.</p><p>On the flipside, downloadable apps offer more power and flexibility. It may be worth getting all your friends to invest in an app, if the result is better than free, accessible websites. But, you can only get all your friends to download apps so many times.&nbsp;</p><p>Online Town is extremely accessible. Mozilla Hubs is a close second – the only problem is that it runs sluggishly on some computers.&nbsp;</p><p>AltSpaceVR is free but requires a VR headset which most people don't have.</p><p>Minecraft is $30 and requires creating an account, which I think is generally worth it but only if it's actually the most appropriate tool for the job.</p><p><strong>Proximity Chat</strong></p><p>Some apps make people louder if they are closer to you. This gives you sort of the organic conversation feeling that parties have – you can wander around a virtual room, briefly listening in and chatting with people until you find a conversation you're excited by.&nbsp;</p><p>Proximity chat is most important if you're aiming for a largish party.</p><p>Hubs, Altspace and Online Town all feature this out-of-the-box.</p><p>Minecraft does not have proximity chat. There is a mod you can download that provides it, but the Minecraft Mod Scene is a wild west of hacky downloads that I think only make sense to inflict on your friends if they're a particular kind of nerd who's excited by that. (Normal minecraft is ""pretty accessible, apart from costing money"", but I think modded Minecraft is basically a dealbreaker for inviting newcomers)</p><p>I found some videogames that had proximity chat built in, but they were more expensive (more like $60). That's a bigger ask than I'd make of people I invited to a party. Since the whole point of proximity chat is to enable large freeform parties here, I didn't investigate them further.</p><p><strong>VR</strong></p><p><i>Altspace</i> and <i>Mozilla Hubs</i> both allow you to go for ""full immersion"" if you own a VR headset. The Oculus Quest is around $400 and in my opinion quite worth the price... but unfortunately seems to be sold out and I'm not sure when you can next get one. If coronavirus had struck 1-2 years later I think it might have been a valid option for tons of remote people to hang out in VR. Alas, the timing is slightly off.<br><br>I personally find VR gives me a bit of a headache and sometimes nausea, which limits my time to around an hour. I also expect this to improve a bit in another couple years. My current sense is that it's more like a fun novel experience to try than a serious contender for frequent-virtual-hangout space.</p><p><strong>Intuitiveness / Smoothness</strong></p><p>Creating good controls for a virtual world is tricky. I found Online Town by far the most intuitive. Altspace, Hubs and Minecraft are each differently unintuitive.</p><h1>The Apps in Detail</h1><h2>Minecraft</h2><p>This was my first experience with a virtual, telepresent world. Seven years ago, when my girlfriend and I were long-distance, we would stay connected via Minecraft dates.</p><p>The distinguishing feature of Minecraft is that it is not a game, and it is not a videochatting app. It is a world. You can plant trees, grow crops, invent tools, build a house, found a civilization.&nbsp;</p><p>It drops you off in the world with no context and few instructions. Some people find that confusing and bounce off of it. The trick is that Minecraft is like real life – it has meaning insofar as you invest meaning into it, and in my experience it's easier to create meaning together than by yourself. My girlfriend and I built a house together, which we decorated and treated as a shared home.</p><p>Minecraft is an infinite canvas, but like the real world, you have to work to accomplish things. There is risk and danger and cost. You can build a statue of gold, but only if you go dig up that gold. This gives things a sense of ""weight"" that they don't have in worlds where you can place any object you want immediately.</p><p>For Valentines Day, I built my girlfriend a treehouse on a hill. There was a place nearby where the sun set each day, but there was a large mountain partially blocking the view. I spent a week digging up the mountain and replacing it with a giant glass heart.&nbsp;</p><p>My interest in Minecraft has waxed and waned over the years. I generally find that I care about Minecraft in proportion to how much other people I'm close with are invested in the same world. It's a valid avenue for social reality, which has strength depending on how many people believe in it.</p><p>So, before coronavirus came, I already had a clear sense of what a virtual world that felt ""lived in"" could look like, and how to use that to connect with people who were far away. I find Minecraft a good place to ""hang out"" with friends, and go on little virtual hikes.</p><p>A big question (which I'm not yet certain of) is is how Minecraft compares more directly to other apps that <i>aren't</i> trying to be a living, breathing world. If you want a world, Minecraft provides, but what if you want a temporary, ephemeral party?</p><p>I've had some good experience with Minecraft Hikes. Last weekend, I invited friends to download WesterosCraft, a modded version of Minecraft (easier to install than most mods), which features the entire western continent from Game of Thrones. We hiked from Winterfell Castle to the large wall in the north. It made for a nice hour-long activity, during which we chatted and organically started playing the sorts of games we might play on a hike (things like ""20 questions"").</p><h2>Online Town</h2><p>Online Town is a video chat, where you get a little pixel avatar who can walk around a 2D virtual world. You can videochat with other people who are nearby, and can't see or hear people who are further away. It looks like this:</p><figure style=""width:100%;""><img src=""https://town.siempre.io/images/site/hn-cleaned.png""></figure><p>The app is only a month old, and has very few features, and lags when large numbers of people are in a room. But, it's a very elegant concept that I think is simple for people to understand. It runs in a browser, and doesn't require a download or account.&nbsp;</p><p>I think Online Town is the best option for most casual ""parties"" – creating an online gathering with around 15-30 people who can wander around into different conversations in a fairly organic way. It is both helpful for spontaneous conversation forming, and for giving a little feeling of ""physical interaction.""</p><p>The developers are still adding new features, and I'm hoping that over time this gets fleshed out. I think the biggest obstacle right now is that it lags when too many people join, which directly undermines the core use-case. Optimization is hard and I'm not expecting that to change very soon. But in general, they've continued adding features since I first checked it out a couple weeks ago.</p><p>Longterm I think it'd be delightful if it gave people more opportunity to create their own pixel art to populate the world with, to capture some of the ""actual virtual world"" that Minecraft offers while maintaining Online Town's simplicity and elegance.</p><p>Another friend of mine would like a version of Online Town where instead of a teeny pixel avatar, your avatar <i>is</i> your videochat stream, so that you can immediately recognize people, and not have to shift attention back and forth between the pixel world and video streams below. I think this is also a pretty valid choice that I'd be excited to see the Online Town folk (or someone else) try.</p><h2>Mozilla Hubs</h2><p>Hubs is a virtual space where you can walk around in 3D, speaking and hearing the people near you. You can create ""windows"" that have youtube videos playing, or place 3D objects around that other people can wiggle around or resize. You can include a video stream of yourself, so people can see both your ""virtual self"" (which appears as a robot) while also looking at your face.</p><figure><img src=""https://i0.wp.com/skarredghost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Mozilla_Hubs_intro.jpg?ssl=1""></figure><p>Hubs gets a lot of basic things right – it's web based, so it works across many platforms, including VR. It has all the features I expect/hope for Online Town to have eventually.</p><p>But the result is... just a bit too janky, occasionally laggy, and confusing in order for me to be deeply excited about it. I think this is an Uncanny Valley thing: Online Town is a teeny pixelated world that I find janky-but-cute. My personal experience of Mozilla Hubs was that it was <i>trying</i> to create an immersive 3D world, but the seams were too visible and it was harder to get into.&nbsp;</p><p>It <i>does </i>basically works just fine, and has more features than Town, so may be a better fit for some people's needs.</p><p>Mozilla Hubs takes place in ""rooms"", pre-built 3D environments you get to choose. Different rooms range <i>widely</i> in how graphics-intensive they are, so if you are finding the experience sluggish, you can switch to a different, simpler room.&nbsp;</p><p>One great thing for Mozilla hubs is that it comes with a level-editor called <a href=""https://hubs.mozilla.com/spoke"">Spoke</a>, which you can use to create whatever type of room you want, or edit existing rooms if they're Not Quite Right. The LessWrong team used it to create <a href=""https://hubs.mozilla.com/r4bp5FE/expert-truthful-congregation-v3-1"">Our April Fools Prank Room</a> (optimized for being computationally simply), and more recently I used it to create an <a href=""https://hubs.mozilla.com/uiRhxs4/rich-lonely-meet"">alternate version of the existing Foggy Lake room</a>, removing some restrictions on player movement that the original version had come with.</p><p>Rooms can hold up to 25 people, but I found them to get laggy once they got more than 15 or so.&nbsp;</p><h2>AltspaceVR</h2><p>AltspaceVR is an obvious evolution of Mozilla Hubs (I've actually heard that Mozilla Hubs was founded by former Altspace employees). It takes place in VR, although there's a Windows app you can download.&nbsp;</p><p>It generally works more smoothly than Hubs. The world is slightly prettier and more cohesive. You can see people's mouth move when they talk. It prominently features Events where people meet to talk about particular things, or watch videos together, or play games.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src=""https://www.roadtovr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/altspacevr-3.jpg""></figure><p>One of my favorite bits about Altspace is that you can create your own world. And whereas Mozilla Hub's Spoke editor feels like a complicated, professional editing software, Altspace's world editor feels fun and (mostly) intuitive. Selecting objects and moving them around made feel like Tony Stark in Iron Man.</p><figure style=""width:100%;""><img src=""https://i.pinimg.com/originals/bb/bd/4e/bbbd4e78ca4a5477eec5e7aaf1432be3.gif""><figcaption>It felt like this.</figcaption></figure><p>The most interesting experience I had was ""making a friend.""&nbsp;</p><p>I traveled to a world with a cabin by a lake, where a few other players were hanging out. I listened in on their conversation a bit. At the time, I felt a bit nervous and didn't want to speak up.&nbsp;</p><p>I explored the nearby woods a bit, eventually finding a large animated stag. While I was staring at it, another player appeared. He said ""man, that's a cool stag"", and I said ""yeah"", and then we chatted a bit. Eventually he said ""Hey man, wanna come to the game room?"" and opened up a portal.</p><p>I followed him through the portal to a gaming lounge, which featured a large chess board. There were no special rules governing the board – I could just pick up pieces, and put them down, basically like real life. He and I started a game. We were both pretty bad at chess, and I focused more on taking pieces than winning. But we had a fun time, and afterwards he said ""Hey man, wanna friend each other and hang out again sometime? I'd love a rematch."" I said ""sure!""</p><p>And... well, okay and then I ended up deciding I didn't want to spend much more time in Altspace because Minecraft was overall better. But, there was something good and pure about that interaction. It gave me a sense that I could actually just make friends in an organic fashion.</p><p><strong>The Pro, and Con: VR</strong></p><p>I think, 2 years from now, enough people with have VR headsets, and VR will have improved enough, that something like Altspace would be a great tool for quarantine socialization. As is, I think it doesn't quite feel good enough to really be better than simpler options like Online Town or richer options like Minecraft.</p><p>But Altspace did very much feel like The Future. If you read Snow Crash and thought ""man, I want that"", well, you can have it now.&nbsp;</p><h1>Go Forth and Hang Out</h1><p>This is all I got for now. Hopefully you have some new interesting ideas for ways to host online gatherings, or maintain relationships in a Socially Distant world.</p><p>Any other tools you've tried? I'd love to hear about them in the comments.</p>",Raemon,raemon,Raemon,

I’d rather not just right a bunch of useless material so I can say I’ve written something, so I’m going to be stopping that and only updating when I actually feel like I have something good to say. This will hopefully mean better if more sporadic content. It will also probably mean that sometimes content comes in rapid bursts as I finish going through research material and suddenly have a lot to write about. Sideways in Hyperspace will be the exception to this, I will still be maintaining an update schedule for that, but it will be reduced in frequency from weekly updates to biweekly updates. This will give me more time to write and edit and hopefully produce something with fewer errors and poor writing. The next chapter of SiH will be posted this Sunday, and then every other Sunday there will be an update.</p>
<p>I currently have four essay series in the pipeline:</p>
<p><a href=""https://hivewired.wordpress.com/the-death-series/"">The Death Series</a> – Where I talk about Terror Management Theory, Becker, and how death interfaces with human cognition and society, along with how to overcome the fear of life, annihilation, and disempowerment, and how to gain and maintain agency in the face of the madness of the universe. I have probably three or four more essays to go before this series is completed, but it’s currently the furthest along.</p>
<p><a href=""https://hivewired.wordpress.com/truth/"">The Truth Series</a> – Where I go back through a history of rationality and attempt to distill down the essence in as short a format as I can manage, and building off that history in order to develop a high powered set of practices for those interested in world-saving. This essay series is maybe half-finished and I’m not sure how long it will be in the end.</p>
<p>The Extinction Series – Where I actually talk about X-Risk, the end of the world, and the threats humanity is facing. I’m the least far along on this series and it currently only contains <a href=""https://hivewired.wordpress.com/2020/03/09/sleepwalking-toward-armageddon/"">one essay</a>.</p>
<p>Those three series will be compiled afterward into what I’m currently calling The Eschatologist’s Handbook: A Guide to the End of the World.</p>
<p>The final essay series I’m working on is the Confessions of a Transhumanist series, which also currently has only <a href=""https://hivewired.wordpress.com/2020/04/06/confessions-of-a-transhumanist-on-life-in-known-space/"">one essay</a>. This will discuss my personal views on things like politics, justice, death, morality, and society. These posts will be fairly varied and not particularly connected to each other but are essentially attempts to make my worldview legible in the broad and general sense. This is a lower priority than the other projects so the posts for it will come more sporadically as I’m feeling inspired.</p>
<p>Beyond that, I have a bunch of stand-alone essays I’ve been meaning to write, such as one on various high-variance strategies and their use and their risks, as well as low-variance alternatives to them. <span style=""color:var(--color-text);"">I also want to go back over all of my material on plurality and identity and rewrite it.

Our house has a dinner rotation, with each of the six adults typically
cooking once a week.  Last week Lily (6y) asked if she could take a
turn, and I offered to help her.  Before I let her sign up I talked
her through what this would entail: enough food for eight people, two
of them vegan, with at least one protein, starch, and vegetable.  She
described what she was thinking of cooking, I pointed out issues, she
tweaked it.  She eventually ended up with rice, beans, cheese, sliced
tomatoes with garlic, fresh spinach, and avocado sauce.

</span>

</p><p>

When she went to sign up she was sad to see that all the slots were
full several days out, but wrote her initial on the next open day.

</p>

<p>

When I came downstairs from work on the day she was going to cook, she
was very excited to start right away.  She wanted to start with the
avocado sauce, but I described how the rice and beans were going to
need some time on the stove and how we should start with them instead.
I would have preferred to leave this entirely up to her, but if dinner
ended up being late that would be kind of annoying for our
housemates.

</p>

<p>

Lily measured out the water for the <a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/recipes/rice"">rice</a> and
asked me to put it on the stove.  She wanted to put the rice in right
away, but I described how it tastes much better if you bring the water
to a boil first.

</p>

<p>

<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/lily-measuring-water-for-rice-big.jpg""><img src=""https://www.jefftk.com/lily-measuring-water-for-rice.jpg"" srcset=""https://www.jefftk.com/lily-measuring-water-for-rice.jpg 550w, https://www.jefftk.com/lily-measuring-water-for-rice-2x.jpg 1100w"" /></a>

</p>

<p>

Next we went down to the basement and got a #10 can of black beans.
Normally we would use smaller cans, but we've been <a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/organizing-a-group-buy-of-flour"">buying</a> from the
commercial food supply chain.  She wasn't able to turn the can opener,
so I did it for her.

</p>

<p>

I suggested we cook some onions to put in the beans, which she was ok
with as long as I cut them up, since she didn't want to be using the
sharp knife.  I sliced some onions and put them on low heat with oil.

</p>

<p>

She wanted to start the avocado sauce again, and now I agreed it was
time.  After picking an avocado and asking me to cut it in half, she
scraped it out into a bowl.  I think she remembered our Au Pair, Erika,
making it, because I have no idea what to put in an avocado sauce.
She put in water, lime juice, and salt, and then asked me to blend
it.  She told me it was ready, but I suggested she taste it first,
after which she wanted a bit more salt.

</p>

<p>

For the cheese she asked me to get out the mozzarella and the grater,
and she grated a small plateful.

</p>

<p>

For the tomatoes she picked some out of the fridge, washed them, and
cut them with a butter knife.  She got our the minced garlic and put
some on, though if I had been watching more closely I would have
recommended she use much less garlic.

</p>

<p>

At this point the water was boiling so we put in the rice, and the
onions were ready to add to the beans.  We spent some time spicing the
beans, which was more me cooking and her helping than the other way
around.

</p>

<p>

I asked if there was anything left, and she remembered she'd wanted
fresh spinach.  We picked out a bowl from the hutch, and filled it
with spinach.

This <a href=""https://youtu.be/-4EDhdAHrOg"">viral YouTube video</a> captures it perfectly.</p><p>Of course it&#x2019;s not strictly limited by gender, that&#x2019;s just the stereotype. And the underlying psychological details are fairly meaty; <a href=""https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/skills-healthy-relationships/201606/stop-trying-fix-things-just-listen"">this article</a> captures a lot of it pretty well for me.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve known about all this for a long time now, and it&#x2019;s always made sense at a sort of descriptive level of how people behave and what people need. But despite reading that article (and <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1maplf/why_do_men_usually_try_to_solve_problems_instead/"">a good reddit thread</a>) I&#x2019;ve never really understood the &#x201C;why&#x201D;. What is the actual value of listening and &#x201C;emotional support&#x201D; in these kind of scenarios? Why do people need that? Well I finally had it happen to me recently when I was aware enough to notice the meta, and thus write this post.</p><p>I now find it easiest to think about in terms of the second-order psychological effects of bad things happening. When a bad thing happens to you, that has direct, obvious bad effects on you. But it also has secondary effects on your model of the world. Your mind (consciously or subconsciously) now has new information that the world is <em>slightly less safe</em> or <em>slightly less predictable</em> than it thought before. And of course the direct, obvious bad effects make you <em>vulnerable</em> (not just &#x201C;feel&#x201D; vulnerable, although normally that too &#x2013; they make you <em>actually</em> vulnerable because you&#x2019;ve just taken damage, so further damage becomes increasingly dangerous).</p><p>Obviously sometimes, and depending on the scenario, the first-order effect dominates and you really should just solve that problem directly. This is what makes the video so absurd &#x2013; having a nail in your head is hard to beat in terms of the first-order effects dominating. But in real versions of these cases, sometimes the second-order effects are more significant, or more urgent, or at the least more easily addressable. In these cases it&#x2019;s natural to want to address the second-order effects first. And the best way to do that is talking about it.</p><p>Talking about a problem to somebody you have a close relationship with addresses these second-order effects in a pretty concrete way: it reaffirms the reliability of your relationship in a way that makes the world feel <em>more</em> safe and predictable, and it informs an ally of your damage so that they can protect you while you&#x2019;re vulnerable and healing. But of course you don&#x2019;t accomplish this by talking <em>directly</em> about the second-order problem. The conversation is still, <em>at the object level</em>, about the first-order problem, which is why it&#x2019;s so easy to misinterpret. To make it worse, the second-order problems are largely internal, and thus invisible, so it&#x2019;s easy for whoever you&#x2019;re talking to to assume they&#x2019;re &#x201C;not that bad&#x201D; and that the first-order problem dominates, even when it doesn&#x2019;t.</p><p>Working through this has given me some ideas to try the next time this happens to me. At a guess, the best way to handle it is to open the conversation with something like &#x201C;I need you to make me feel safe&#x201D; <em>before</em> you get into the actual first-order problem, but I guess we&#x2019;ll see.</p>",,,,

However, people tend to get too attached to their plans, so the corrective wisdom is &quot;all plans fail&quot; so they detach themselves at the proper speed.</p><p>The point of an applied rationality training regime is to get good enough at planning that your plans survive contact with reality.</p><h1>Combative Murphyjitsu</h1><p>Bog-standard <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/d922gAtBM8JNzkKKJ/p/zZkMm6ySRJKhHJHfq"">murphyjitsu</a> is an explicit process.

This has general been good for the epistemic health of our community, but at the same time we should also worry about whether everything we have inherited is true and beneficial. In other words, we need to apply skepticism to skepticism itself.</p><p>It&apos;s often good to start with the strengths of a movement and consider how these can also become weaknesses if taken too extremes, so this is what we&apos;ll do in this post instead of taking them at face value. The fundamental promise of skepticism is that it will prevent you from being mislead by weak evidence, poor reasoning, social pressure or those who would manipulate you.</p><p><strong>The opposite of foolishing accepting weak evidence </strong>is being excessively dogmatic in the standards of evidence you require, even when circumstances require you to decide based on inconclusive evidence. A famous <a href=""https://www.bmj.com/content/363/bmj.k5094"">spoof article</a> jokes that we don&apos;t know parachutes are reliable because we don&apos;t have a randomised controlled trial.</p><p>Wittgenstein wanted to argue that language is nonsense insofar as it failed <a href=""https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Picture_theory_of_language"">to paint a picture or possible pictures of the world</a> (in a particular technical sense). The only trouble was that this claim itself didn&apos;t paint a picture of the world. The logical positivists belived that beliefs were defined in terms of the experimental predictions they made, however it is <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/dTkWWhQkgxePxbtPE/no-logical-positivist-i"">almost entirely false</a> that just now a chocolate cake spontaneously formed at the center of the sun then dissolve and it isn&apos;t clear how to define this claim itself experimentally or in terms of mathematics. <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9fpWoXpNv83BAHJdc/the-comedy-of-behaviorism"">Behaviourism</a> argued that it was unscientific to ascribe emotions, beliefs or thoughts to humans as we can&apos;t directly observe these, which resulted in a greatly crippled psychology field.</p><p>Similarly, <strong>the opposite of foolishing accepting poor reasoning</strong> is being excessively dogmatic in the preciseness of arguments that you need. When talking about ethics, Aristotle argues that, &quot;We must not expect more precision than the subject-matter exists&quot;. Some subjects are inherently hard to talk about and expecting too much precision can prevent us talking about it at all. One example is when people dismiss philosophy as too vague to be useful and then end up effectively adopting a philosophical theory anyway, but without any deep thought or evaluation.</p><p>Similarly Kieran Healy argues in <a href=""https://kieranhealy.org/files/papers/fuck-nuance.pdf"">Fuck Nuance</a> that demanding more nuance can be a lazy response. He worries than you can almost universally proclaim, &quot;But isn&apos;t it more complicated than that?&quot; or &quot;Isn&apos;t it really both/and?&quot; or &quot;Aren&apos;t you leaving out [X]?&quot;. Theorisation requires some level of abstraction and simplification and the demand for nuance interferes with this.</p><p>Additionally, we should expect that not everyone will have the capacity to produce solid reasoning even when their ideas are correct. Some people are better at discovering new ideas, while other people are better at filtering them. Some people are good at both, but these are relatively few. If we only learn from strong filterers, we miss out on the ideas that are still on the creative edge. I resonate with Jordan Peterson&apos;s characterisation of good art as expressing that which is important, but which cannot yet be fully expressed.</p><p>Many communities have knowledge embedded in traditions that derives from long and hard practical experience. These arguments are persuasively discussed in <a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/16/book-review-seeing-like-a-state/"">Seeing Like a State</a> and <a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/06/04/book-review-the-secret-of-our-success/"">The Secrets of Our Success</a>.</p><p>Then there is the issue that those who are less educated or who are non-native speakers are likely to be less able to provide arguments up to a particular standard independently of the truth of their claims. Some people suggest we respond by not applying any significant scrutiny to the truth claims of those who are more marginalised, but my suggestion is solely that we approach these with more care.</p><p>The <strong>opposite of being excessively resistant to social pressure</strong> is being contrarian and adopting non-standard positions so that you can differentiate yourself and signal your ability to think differently. But it&apos;s also a mistake to completely disregard social evidence. What people believe provides some level of Bayesian evidence, but beyond that, no-one has time to evaluate the evidence for everything. Even if it were possible, it would almost certaintly be worse for your own well-being. It can be hard not to engage in this impossible task as the alternative is admitting that you believe thesis X because simply you were told it and not because you&apos;ve made up your own mind.</p><p>But beyond this, it can lead to the bad habit of turning everything into an argument independently of how unpopular a view is. Social capital is limited, so it&apos;s important to spend this wisely if you want to have influence.</p><p>The <strong>opposite of being naive is being too distrusting</strong>. It can be very easy to identify one or two circumstances when a particular person or organisation lied to you or misled you and then refuse to ever trust anything they ever say again. This may be reasonable if we avoid them without any significant costs due to our circumstances, but this isn&apos;t always possible.</p>",Ouroborus,ouroborus,Ouroborus,

<p>We’re all working from the same information, mostly from Cuomo’s slides. Let’s reproduce them here, give the rest of the information, then go from there.</p>
<p><span></span></p>
<h3>What We Know</h3>
<p><img src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/A83a8AQGZDBaETGFL/lp4agmoxgobbvvgejiuq""></p>

<p><img src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/A83a8AQGZDBaETGFL/bkyyamcncvvxmgkiteph""></p>
<p>Also in 2 other slides:</p>
<p>52% female sample with 12% positive, 48% male with 15.9% positive.</p>
<p>Asian 8.8% of total with 11.7% positive, black 14.3% with 22.1% positive, Latino 17.6% of total with 22.5% positive, and white 57.1% of total with 9.1% positive. Cuomo says this is mostly because most non-whites in the state live in New York City.</p>
<p>Samples were taken at grocery stores. From the comment that this ‘missed essential workers’ I presume it happened during work hours. People were given their results if they wanted to know, and participation was voluntary.</p>
<p>So many questions. Still, very good data. Many thanks for providing it. What does it all mean?</p>
<p>Mostly people seemed surprised the numbers were so high, and a lot of people objected the infection rate couldn’t possibly be so high, and thus started looking for evidence it wasn’t so. As opposed to my reaction, which was that the rate seemed too low so there were probably things I needed to adjust for. My pre-study best guess was as follows, as posted yesterday:</p>
<blockquote><p>That would make the infection rate in New York State overall about 19% now and 29% when things are finished. We’d have identified 13.3% of positive cases as of right now, with&nbsp;<em>vastly&nbsp;</em>inadequate testing.</p>
<p>This would also imply New York City was roughly 30% infected, which is on the extreme low end of my previous prior guess range.</p></blockquote>
<p>That now seems fully compatible with the results of the antibody tests. Alas, part of the problem with that compatibility is that there’s a wide range of potential ways the results could be biased.</p>
<p>Nate Silver <a href=""https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/1253722904103092230"">had a good twitter thread</a> outlining the three big problems with the numbers. The numbers lag, there was a biased sample (we just don’t know in what direction or how big a bias) and not knowing the specificity/sensitivity of the test.</p>
<p>By contrast, there have been lots of links from people who should know better to <a href=""https://twitter.com/ashishkjha/status/1253399114559062016"">a pretty bad Twitter thread</a> by Anish Jha, who was quick and has reasonable credentials and claim to authority and made noises that sounded like being “responsible” – he speculates about what would happen if sensitivity was only 93% in a test that was only 3.6% positive for almost 1000 people in 32% of the state, which caused me to have a would-facepalm-except-not-touching-face moment. I did the informal version of pointing this out (a reply pointing out the obvious) as soon as I saw the thread. The sufficiently formal version of pointing this and some other remarkably basic things out <a href=""https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1253502296790532106.html"">was done by Venk Murthy here</a>.</p>
<p>We won’t discuss the age, gender or ethnicity breakdowns at all beyond the implications for children. Infections by age didn’t vary much, although they might vary more once you account for how the sample is biased, in ways that are again hard to figure out. Gender data matches previous findings so it’s not giving us much to discuss. The ethnic numbers are, Cuomo says, mostly a function of NYC vs. the rest of the state, which makes them too confounded to say too much without cross-tabs. If we did get the cross-tabs, we’d be in a better position to say more on that.</p>
<h3>Specificity</h3>
<p>How specific is this test? To what extent are false positives an issue? It would be good to tackle that question first.</p>
<p>We have a naive lower bound on specificity from the 3.6% positive rate upstate. In theory, without further evidence, we have to presume that maybe <em>none&nbsp;</em>of those people were positive plus a margin for error. In practice, that’s obviously not what we should be guessing. Once we know that we have a 21% positive rate for New York City&nbsp;<em>on the same test with the same procedure,&nbsp;</em>we can use the ratio of infections in the two places to figure out what range of false positive rates is plausible.</p>
<p>We have a list of deaths and confirmed infections by county <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/new-york-coronavirus-cases.html"">here</a>, from The New York Times. There are 780 reported deaths and 21,043 confirmed infections in Rest of State (hereafter “upstate”) versus 16,161 reported deaths and 271,578 confirmed infections in Long Island, New York City, Rockland and Westchester (hereafter “downstate”). This gives upstate a lower CFR (3.71% vs. 5.95%) which partly reflects better testing (e.g. positive test percents have been lower) and may also represent better results due to non-overwhelmed hospitals, but also may reflect reduced under-reporting of deaths.</p>
<p>To be conservative on multiple levels, we’ll use deaths – the downstate death rate is likely somewhat higher, but they’re also probably under-reporting most of those extra deaths. Upstate has 35.8% of the state’s population, versus 64.2% for downstate. It has 4.6% of reported deaths. Thus, naively we should expect the true upstate infection rate to be 8.6% of the downstate rate, and false negatives should cancel each other out here once we remove false positives. In the antibody tests, 18.9% of downstate was positive. Thus, we assume that (0.189 – FalsePositiveRate)*0.086 = (0.036 – FalsePositiveRate).</p>
<p>The false positive rate is therefore about 2.16%, give or take margin of error, and worries that test sites upstate were not representative (which could go in either direction).</p>
<p>(We could and&nbsp;<em>someone really should&nbsp;</em>attempt to improve this by adjusting all the numbers for various things, but I’ll consider that task beyond scope here.)</p>
<p>That’s a lot! Upstate this implies the&nbsp;<em>majority&nbsp;</em>of positive results are false positives.</p>
<p>In the context of “21% of New York City” however, it’s&nbsp;<em>not&nbsp;</em>a lot. It’s still 19% of New York City, and a 90% chance that a positive is real.</p>
<p>How much of that 2.1% could be eliminated in individual cases by doing a second test? That depends. If we have a test that’s looking for some of the wrong antibodies along with the right ones, and you have the wrong ones it is looking for, you’ll always show positive. If it’s other kinds of error, it won’t repeat. If it’s that the test is&nbsp;<em>sort of&nbsp;</em>responsive to other antibodies, then you’ll get something in between.</p>
<p>[TODO check with Dad to see how optimistic to be here]</p>
<h3>Sensitivity and Lag</h3>
<p>What about false negatives? The good news is we were able to solve for false positives without worrying about the false negative rate. The bad news is that the false negative rate is an open-ended source of bias that could be tiny and could be huge. In theory it allows us to claim that the true rate could be arbitrarily higher than what is reported, up until we hit the barrier that true positive rates can only go so high in their highest areas.</p>
<p>We could, of course, find a group of people who&nbsp;<em>definitely&nbsp;</em>had Covid-19 because they tested positive and had lots of symptoms and were hospitalized, then recovered a month ago, test <em>them&nbsp;</em>for antibodies, and get the answer that way. Mostly. We should do that yesterday. However, false negative rates might be different for different groups that have different antibodies or different antibody rates, so that number might be modestly too high.</p>
<p>For now, given what I know of such tests, I’m going to presume that the false negative rate for those infected a long time ago is low, let’s say it’s also 2%.</p>
<p>And then there’s the lag issue.</p>
<p>We do know of one&nbsp;<em>huge&nbsp;</em>source of false negatives. It takes (something like) two weeks for antibodies to show up. A person infected a few days ago will test negative on the antibody test. We can add to that about a two day turnaround on the tests, which were announced on Thursday 4/23.</p>
<p>Thus, we should roughly treat the test as showing the cumulative infection rates <em>sixteen days prior,&nbsp;</em>which is 4/7.</p>
<p>We’ll come back later to what that means about current rates.</p>
<h3>Warnings Against Using Antibody Tests are Obvious Nonsense</h3>
<p>Before we return to the calculations, I want to briefly shame everyone who is trying to look responsible by warning people not to use the results of the antibody tests on a personal level due to possible mistakes. What if someone got a wrong result and did something they shouldn’t?</p>
<p>I hereby declare a new rule that these people are no longer allowed to put on pants. We can’t be confident the pants are clean. They might be dirty, there’s always some measurement error, so we have to always assume all their pants are dirty. So no pants for them. Sorry.</p>
<p>If you give someone 98% accurate information about whether they have antibodies to Covid-19,&nbsp;<em>they will make much better decisions&nbsp;</em>than if they lacked that information, both personally and for society. If we put such people into positions where they are likely to be exposed and expose others, instead of other people,&nbsp;<em>we will save lives.&nbsp;</em>Doing so will help save our jobs, our economy, our future, and with it our ability to continue saving and living lives.</p>
<p>There is also the concern trolling that perhaps such people are not immune to reinfection. They are probably immune for a long time. And they are almost certainly immune for now. We need to make decisions now. We need to live our lives now.</p>
<p>Yes, we’d rather run a better or second test and be 99.8% sure instead, if we had that option, but we do what we can with what information we do have. And for now, we’d much rather test two people once than one person twice.</p>
<p>I could go on but feel no need to do so. We now return to crunching the numbers.</p>

<h3>Bias and Sampling Error</h3>
<p>That was the easy part. The hard part is correcting for bias, in both directions.</p>
<p>We know how to collect mostly random samples (minus the refusal rate) by using things like phone directories. New York didn’t do that. They set up shop in grocery stores, during work hours (I think), and took volunteers using an unknown (to me for me) procedure.</p>
<p>I want to be clear.<em> I am very happy they did that!&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good! Viva la <a href=""https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2020/03/the-speed-premium-in-an-exponentially-growing-pandemic-world.html"">speed premium</a>! Move fast and break things! Do science to it!</p>
<p>It does leave us a bit of a puzzle to solve.</p>
<p>Possible hypotheses I could come up with after two days on how this sample might be importantly biased:</p>
<ol>
<li>Grocery stores chosen might be not random, or not weighted properly by how many people use them.</li>
<li>Procedures in different places might be different.</li>
<li>People who have had symptoms, or who were otherwise higher/lower risk, might have a different probability of joining the sample conditional on going to the grocery store. Especially since test results were given to individuals afterwards.</li>
<li>Essential workers were working and thus mostly missed, because the data was gathered mostly/entirely during work hours.</li>
<li>Dead people don’t buy groceries.</li>
<li>Sufficiently sick people don’t buy groceries in person. Anyone with symptoms hopefully stayed home.</li>
<li>Institutionalized people don’t buy groceries. Anyone in a nursing home, or prison, will be excluded.</li>
<li>Sufficiently rich and/or cautious people who can afford delivery won’t go to the grocery store.</li>
<li>Instacart workers would be vastly over-represented. Always shopping! May have been excluded from sample intentionally or have been working and thus unable to stop to join study.</li>
<li>People who batch grocery shopping would go less often and be underrepresented, and also mostly be more responsible presumably. Whereas those who go every day or two will show up more often and be over-represented.</li>
<li>Children weren’t tested at all, presumably for legal reasons.</li>
</ol>
<p>Location selection could have been weird in any number of ways. It might be especially weird upstate, potentially impacting our specificity calculation. I see no reason to assume it points in one direction rather than the other. It seems more like extra noise.</p>
<p>The basic pattern is that the people at highest risk are not in the sample, and the people who are at lowest risk are also not in the sample. The sample concentrates among those at medium risk, and potentially over-represents the ones among them taking more risk rather than less risk.</p>
<p>The more you think grocery stores&nbsp;<em>are themselves an important remaining point of risk&nbsp;</em>the more you’d be inclined to think that the sample is artificially high risk. I think grocery stores are the highest risk activity that many, perhaps most, of us still engage in outside of essential workers. But I also think that the few remaining high risk actions are where the bulk of remaining probably risk lies.</p>
<p>Naively, it’s tough to know which effect dominates.</p>
<p>Not testing children is odd. We don’t know how often they get infected because we don’t bother testing them. I could believe a world where they are very hard to infect and are basically always negative. I could also believe a world in which they are in relatively large households and are incapable of taking proper precautions, and thus get infected reasonably often. The 8.2% infection rate for ages 18-24 is suggestive of lower rates, but also could largely reflect the conditions of college students. Infection rates and age seem mostly uncorrelated in this data, so my guess is that child infection rates are if anything lower, but not that dissimilar to overall rates because they get secondary household infections a lot. We really don’t know, and given legal conditions, probably will never know.</p>
<p>Instacart workers are very high risk, along with other delivery services workers, but how many are in the sample? Possibly none, if they excluded them. Possibly a lot. Instacart has more than 500k full-time shoppers nationwide. In-store personal shoppers are employees of the store and thus presumably excluded from the study. Presumably NY has more than its share of Instacart by a lot, but I don’t know how much more, as it is available across the country and most people are locked down one way or another. My guess is this isn’t that big a factor.</p>
<p>The bigger questions are, how many high risk people are excluded, how many low risk people are excluded, and how high risk slash low risk are those groups relative to the medium risk group.</p>
<p>My prior is that high risk groups are at&nbsp;<em>much&nbsp;</em>higher risk than medium risk groups. High risk groups seem naively like they have at least an order of magnitude more exposure points, <em>and&nbsp;</em>have those points with people who themselves are also far more likely to be higher risk themselves. If people go about their normal business, R0 = 4 is a general estimate, R0 = 8 for New York City, higher for poor areas. Compare that to&nbsp;<em>average&nbsp;</em>R0 ~ 0.84 right now (I said 0.85 yesterday, last two days data has been good) for the state now. An order of magnitude seems like the low end estimate.</p>
<p>My prior is that low risk groups are similarly at&nbsp;<em>much&nbsp;</em>lower risk than medium risk groups. People who are fully isolating properly, including avoiding grocery stores entirely for their entire quarantine house if any, are taking at least an order of magnitude less risk than those who are grocery shopping, if only from the grocery shopping. The risk isn’t zero, but it might be not that dissimilar once those in question locked down. Some of them will have gotten sick before locking down, and either not know it or not be confident enough in it to not isolate.</p>
<p>So probably:</p>
<ol>
<li>The very low risk group is large, its risk is very low, and their rate of participation is also very low here. They’re basically not using grocery stores except via pick-up and delivery, and are excluded from the study.</li>
<li>The medium risk group is the large majority, their rate of participation is normal. They all use the grocery stores. Their risk is probably&nbsp;<em>substantially lower </em>than average.</li>
<li>The high risk group includes essential workers and those who can’t or won’t properly distance (or didn’t do so for a while earlier, and thus are at much higher&nbsp;<em>retrospective&nbsp;</em>risk). Essential workers from this group are not in the sample much, but some are, such as restaurant workers shopping in the morning.</li>
</ol>
<p>My guess is that this process ends up making the resulting group&nbsp;<em>lower&nbsp;</em>risk than average, based purely on who&nbsp;<em>ever&nbsp;</em>gets included rather than rates of inclusion. There are some big exclusion groups at very high risk. Very hard to quantify all this, of course, and could go either way.</p>
<p>The higher risk someone is, however, the more often they likely use the grocery store given they go at all. The (I hope small) group that goes to grocery stores every day or two is a scary one.</p>
<p>Then there’s selection within the store. If you think you’ve been positive, that’s a reason to want an antibody test. However,&nbsp;<em>everyone&nbsp;</em>should want an antibody test if they’re freely available, because the upside on learning you were asymptomatic and recovered is that you get to resume normal activities, or at least adjust your risk level if you are worried about false positives. Plus it was doubtless made clear they wanted to test presumed negative people, so anyone doing this would be helping save lives. People who are generally careful about risk should also likely be more inclined to want the information, and to want to help out with the study.</p>
<p>Thus, for now, I’m going to do no correction for bias in either direction. I’m not confident enough in direction to do that, let alone magnitude. This does point to where we’d like to do studies next to improve our knowledge. Doing more grocery store sampling would be nice, but 3000 is already a reasonable sample. I’d rather spend my efforts now on testing essential worker samples, especially hospital workers but also others, and those who can’t go to the grocery store. Also we should make an effort to quantify the sizes of such groups, and also the excluded low-risk group. Antibody testing the low-risk group as well would be a bonus.</p>
<p>Another idea is to now do the phone directory study, but ask people how often they go to the grocery store and at what times when collecting samples! Then we can figure out how to correct the samples, which lets us take better advantage of what we have, and also lets us gather more samples at grocery stores and get good use out of them.</p>
<p>Now that we’ve discussed sample bias, sensitivity/specificity and lag, we’re ready to put it all together and <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2020/04/23/my-covid-19-thinking-4-23-pre-cuomo-data/"">reconcile it</a> with the analysis I made before seeing the results.</p>
<h3>The Model</h3>
<p>We also update our previous model with several additional days of data. The recent news from New York and also he whole United States has been good, because test numbers have gone up. 24.1% and 23.4% positive rates for 4/23 and 4/24 respectively in New York are big progress over previous rates. We haven’t seen numbers that low since 3/19, which means well before the lock down. We do need to adjust somewhat for the testing surge, but even so we’re progressing well. I’ve lowered my R0 estimate from 0.85 to 0.83 before we continue, also to account for the expectation of gradual drop in R0 due to herd immunity effects over time.</p>
<p><a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2020/04/23/my-covid-19-thinking-4-23-pre-cuomo-data/"">As a reminder</a>, the model assumed a 1% IFR, a 50% under-count of deaths, a 21 day delay from infection to death, a 5 day serial interval, a 2.5 day doubling time before lockdown, that the positive test rates were never that much higher than the point where they stop becoming meaningful even at their peak, and a 5 day delay in testing new infections.</p>
<p>If we total the infections in that model up to and including 4/7, we get 2.57 million, or 13.2% infected.</p>
<p>If we get infections at that time from the antibody tests, and add the 1% death rate and 2.2% false positive and negative rates, we get 11.9% infected.</p>
<p>That is well within the range of plausible bias in data collection, not to mention the huge error bars in what I’m doing via seat of pants. It all seems very reasonable.</p>
<p>The model with the R0 adjustment now predicts that we&nbsp;<em>currently </em>have 3.8 million infections in New York State, or 19.5% overall infection rate. If we did a 10% adjustment down to fully accept the antibody result, we would get 17.7%. Given the new R0, the model projects the final infection count if we fully squash at this rate forever to be 310k additional infections, for a final count of 21.1% infected or 19.0% after adjustment, and a death count of 41,123 before adjustment or 37,010 with the adjustment. Like all models, any second wave after reopening isn’t included. Model thinks about 24,000 have already died because it thinks there’s a 50% under-count that will likely never be corrected.</p>
<p>I have no doubt my model could be improved, and to extent I have time I will work on improving it and on getting useful bounds on areas outside of New York using similar methods. The biggest place to move things around is that the IFR could be lower than 1%, which would proportionally raise infection rates, or <em>possibly </em>that it’s a little higher&nbsp;– the range of numbers that don’t lead to major contradictions are roughly 0.3% to 1.5%. However, the data has now come in on enough front that I see tight error bars on the New York situation. The antibody study only confirms this even more.</p>
<p>Now let’s do more tests!</p>

Cross-posted from <a href=""https://grandunifiedcrazy.com/2020/04/25/fast-takeoff-biological-intelligence/"">Grand, Unified, Crazy</a>.]</em></p><p>One of the possible risks of artificial intelligence is the idea of &#x201C;fast&#x201D; (exponential) takeoff &#x2013; that once an AI becomes even just a tiny bit smarter than humans, it will be able to recursively self-improve along an exponential curve and we&#x2019;ll never be able to catch up with it, making it effectively a god in comparison to us poor humans. While human intelligence is improving over time (via natural selection and perhaps whatever causes the Flynn effect) it does so much, much more slowly and in a way that doesn&#x2019;t seem to be accelerating exponentially.</p><p>But maybe gene editing changes that.</p><p>Gene editing seems about as close as a biological organism can get to recursively editing its own source code, and with recent advances (CRISPR, etc) we are plausibly much closer to functional genetic manipulation than we are to human-level AI. If this is true, humans could reach fast takeoff in our own biological intelligence well before we build an AI capable of the same thing. In this world we&#x2019;re probably safe from existential AI risk; if we&#x2019;re both on the same curve, it only matters who gets started first.</p><p>There are a bunch of obvious objections and weaknesses in this analogy which are worth talking through at a high level:</p><ul><li>The difference between hardware and software seems relevant here. Gene editing seems more like a hardware-level capability, whereas most arguments about fast takeoff in AI talk about recursive improvement of software. It seems easy for a strong AI to recompile itself with a better algorithm, where-as it seems plausibly more difficulty for it to design <em>and then manufacture</em> better hardware.<br><br>This seems like a reasonable objection, though I do have two counterpoints. The first is that, in humans at least, <a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/01/31/the-parable-of-the-talents/"">intelligence seems pretty closely linked to hardware</a>. Software also seems important, but hardware puts strong upper bounds on what is possible. The second counterpoint is that our inability to effectively edit our software source code is, in some sense, a hardware problem; if we could genetically build a better human, capable of more direct meta-cognitive editing&#x2026; I don&#x2019;t even know what that would look like.<br></li><li>Another consideration is generation length. Even talking about hardware replacement, a recursively improving AI should be able to build a new generation on the order of weeks or months. Humans take a <em>minimum</em> of twelve years, and in practice quite a bit more than that most of the time. Even if we end up on the curve first, the different constant factor may dominate.<br></li><li>We don&#x2019;t really understand how our own brains work. Even if we&#x2019;re quite close to functional genetic editing, maybe we&#x2019;re still quite far from being able to use it effectively for intelligence optimization. The AI could still effectively get there first.<br></li><li><a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/"">Moloch</a>. In a world where we do successfully reach an exponential take-off curve in our own intelligence long before AI does, Moloch could devour us all. There&#x2019;s no guarantee that the editing required to make us super-intelligent wouldn&#x2019;t also change or destroy our values in some fashion. We could end up with exactly the same paperclip-maximizing disaster, just executed by a biological agent with human lineage instead of by a silicon-based computer.</li></ul><p>Given all these objections I think it&#x2019;s fairly unlikely that we reach a useful biological intelligence take-off anytime soon. However if we actually are close, then the most effective spending on AI safety may not be on AI research at all &#x2013; it could be on genetics and neuroscience.</p>",,,,

Even if I am 100% prepared and if I check the answers multiple times, I end up making mistakes that are the stuff of dreams.

I&apos;m inclined to think that somewhere in my neuronal processes that number literally turned into another one), or completely botching the correct process for solving the problem even if I have solved similar problems with the correct process tens of times before. </p><p>This can mean the difference between (translating to American grades) an A and a C. Or a C and botching the exam. It makes a big difference. </p><p>One time, I had botched the screen-off test of an exam due to this kind of mistakes. The screen-off test consisted in a multiple choice questions sheet that the professor used to screen-off what tests to spend time correcting in full and what tests not bother correcting. The real test consisted in the open questions and exercises after the screen-off. I managed to convince the professor to correct the rest of the exam even if I botched the screen-off, and I got an A.</p><p>I&apos;m pretty sure this problem <em>doesn&apos;t </em>happen because of </p><ul><li>Anxiety: I&apos;m perfectly calm.</li><li>Calligraphy: It is good and very intelligible.</li><li>Distraction: I don&apos;t get distracted...

Even if I was in a hurry I still wouldn&apos;t understand how I could make such incredible mistakes, given that I already had done the exercises tens of times before.</p><p>I&apos;m using the example of exams because this is the area where this problem shows up the most. It also shows up when programming, but that&apos;s not as impactful, because I can correct the mistakes. I am wondering if there are other areas of life where this is a problem but I am not noticing. If it is a phenomenon isolated to tests or not. It is entirely possible that it is something affecting my usual thought processes in a bad way, but which I&apos;m not aware of, because I can&apos;t check immediately if the thought processes are correct (and even if I could I would make the same mistake, because that&apos;s what happens) and I don&apos;t receive a grade or an error message from the compiler. So this might be much more important than just performance in tests.</p><p>More than how to avoid these mistakes I&apos;m asking: why on Earth do they happen? Could it be that they are more widespread in my/our reasoning and I&apos;m/we&apos;re not noticing? I know that other people suffer from this too, but how much exactly? Nonetheless, if you want to shoot suggestions about how to avoid these problems I&apos;m all ears.</p><p>Bonus: My brain is also noisy in other ways. I have tinnitus even if I am in my early twenties and many symptoms of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_snow"">Visual Snow</a>.

import masks on the team plane (<a href=""https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.wsj.com/amp/articles/a-million-n95-masks-are-coming-from-chinaon-board-the-new-england-patriots-plane-11585821600"">Wall

<p>

Much more impactful than what these seizures are pushing people to do,
however, is what they're pushing people not to do.  A hospital
administrator or governor who could be prioritizing sourcing PPE has
many other things they could focus on, and if the PPE they import has
a large chance of getting seized they're going to prioritize those other
things on the margin.  Independent importers likewise can't risk
having their goods seized without payment, as Indutex reported (""<a href=""https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/04/21/indutex-usa-says-fema-seized-n-95-respirators-national-stockpile/2996256001/"">Let's

they can ramp up production is super valuable, and we'll see less of it
the more risk there is of having your goods taken.

<p>

So much of this crisis has been <a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/authorities-and-amateurs"">poorly handled</a> that any
individual bit I pick to look at seems like it's not worth focusing
on, but this policy is not just foolish, it's foolish in a way that
you might have thought conservatives might have avoided?  Like,
conservatives saying we should avoid lockdowns and let people decide
risk for themselves is the sort of policy disagreement I'd expect to
have, but using the federal government to grab things, discouraging
private initiative and investment, really?

I'll quote my draft quite liberally below:</p><blockquote>In the context of decision theory, comparability is about whether or not it is fair to compare counterfactuals when evaluating decisions, a decision algorithm or decision theory. Perhaps the best way to illustrate is with the example of a medical trial. Let's suppose we're trying to see if aspirin reduces the amount of pain experienced. So if we create two groups, give aspirin to one and then observe that group as having experienced less pain, that is evidence that it does what we want. However, if the aspirin group was healthy and most of other group had cancer, then this wouldn't be a fair test. We would be treating two groups as comparable when they differed in an attribute relevant the to outcome we cared about.</blockquote><blockquote>Given a decision problem, we normally apply a decision theory to construct counterfactuals, then calculate the utility for each and finally make a decision. Prima facie, it appears that these counterfactuals must be comparable in order for a decision theory to count as being reasonable. Otherwise, we would open ourselves to the critique of being the same as a naive researcher in the aspirin example.</blockquote><blockquote>We can clarify this with an example. Casual decision theorists recommend 2-boxing for Newcomb's Problem. They admit that a 1-boxer will receive an extra $1 million, but they would likely argue that this isn't a fair comparison since the opaque box contains $1 million for the 1-boxer, but not for the 2-boxer. This is essentially a dispute over whether these counterfactuals are comparable.</blockquote><p>Why is this important?</p><p>Well, as far as I can tell attempts to understand counterfactuals have taken us to logical counterfactuals at which point we've become stuck. Asking an easier question could help us to become unstuck. And determining if counterfactuals are comparable seems easier than saying what counterfactuals are. Indeed, I would go so far as to say that if we don't know what we mean by comparability then we don't fully even know what we are looking for.</p><p>Given this, I find it strange that this notion hasn't been discussed to any significant degree at all on Less Wrong as far as I can tell, although I haven't performed an in-depth search.</p><p>But before we go any further, it's worth asking what objections could be made to this approach. I'll quote my draft again:</p><blockquote>Firstly, comparability only makes sense if the notion of counterfactuals makes sense. If they don't exist, then we would have to abandon the quest.</blockquote><blockquote>Secondly, we could admit counterfactuals, but deny comparability. Why might we do this? Firstly, the requirement for the past to be comparable regardless of our action seems to assume that our action shouldn't affect the past. But if there <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/pa7mvEmEgt336gBSf/is-backwards-causation-necessarily-absurd"">wasn't any fundamental difference</a> between forwards and backwards causation, this assumption would seem unsupported. Secondly, we might think that only the partial information we have before we are told our action must be the same and that there is no requirement for the counterfactuals to actually be comparable. Evidential decision theory could be justified on these terms.</blockquote><blockquote>Thirdly, we could argue for a notion of comparability that can be trivially satisfied. Causal decision theory leaves the past unchanged and only intervenes at the point of the decision. So these kind of counterfactuals are always trivially comparable, as it seems reasonable to presume that comparability only depends on the past and that identical pasts are automatically comparable. Note that it might be possible to argue for causal decision theory within the comparability framework. If only exact pasts were comparable, then that'd exclude almost every theory except for CDT.</blockquote><blockquote>Fourthly, we could argue that there are many different notions of comparability, so the question, ""What does it mean for counterfactuals to be comparable?"" is meaningless without further information about the purpose we are asking.</blockquote><p><strong>Three questions</strong>:</p><p>I'll finish this post with three questions designed to help clarify the notion of comparability. If you have time, I'd really appreciate it if you thought about the questions before writing your own answers, as that'd likely increase the diversity of responses. </p><p>1) Suppose you have the option to choose one of two boxes: the first containing an item worth 5 utility and the second containing an item worth 10 utility. This results in one counterfactual where you take the first box and receive 5 utility and another where you take the second and receive 10 utility. Almost no-one would dispute that these counterfactuals are comparable, but why?</p><p>2) As discussed above, a casual decision theorist would likely argue that the counterfactuals constructed by a timeless decision theorist aren't comparable because the 1-boxer has $1 million in the mystery box, while the two-boxer's box is empty. Most people on Less Wrong think that the casual decision theorist is wrong. How can we respond to this claim? Does it satisfy another notion of comparability or does this show the notion of comparability is irrelevant?</p><p>3) An evidential decision theorist wouldn't smoke in the Smoking Lesion problem so they don't get cancer. Most people argue that they are incorrect because when evaluating smoking we can't compare a group of people predisposed to cancer to a normal group of people. Is this correct? And if so, wouldn't this mean that a 1-boxer would be correct in rejecting timeless decision theory counterfactuals as non-comparable (contrary to LW wisdom)? (There have been criticisms of the Smoking Lesion problem, but I think we could just make the same argument with Counterfactual Blackmail instead).</p><p><em>This post was supported by the AI Safety Research Program and was influenced by discussion with Davide Zagami and Pablo Moreno although the opinions expressed here are my own.

This was developed by Colonel John Boyd as an abstraction of the rapid decision-making that occurs during combat. The loop contains four stages:</p><p>Observe: Take in information from the environment.</p><p>Orient: Determine the set of possible actions.</p><p>Decide: Choose which action is the best action.</p><p>Act: Do that action.</p><h1>Examples </h1><p>(feel free to skip if the general concept seems to make sense to you)</p><p>These examples are going to be in rather artificial environments. In the real world, it is not so clear which stage of OODA you&apos;re in at any given moment. Nonetheless, I claim that it&apos;s a useful abstraction:</p><p>1. [Note: I suck at chess] In chess, you observe by looking at the chessboard. A naive way to orient is to consider all legal chess moves. However, if you consider too many moves, then deciding which move is best becomes intractable. An experienced chess player will thus orient strategically by only considering a small set of moves. To decide which move is best, chess players will typically run some sort of tree search. Acting in chess is trivial. In typical chess, players are not extremely constrained on time, so the OODA loop is slow.</p><p>2. In Magic: the Gathering, you observe by looking at the board state and the cards in your hand. Similarly to chess, you cannot consider all possible moves, so you must strategically orient based upon a set of moves that experience tells you are likely to be good. You decide by a set of heuristics honed by long hours of playing, possibly by conducting a small amount of search or doing explicit probability calculations. Action in Magic: the Gathering is also trivial. Magic: the Gathering is more constrained on time than chess, but the OODA loop is still relatively slow.</p><p>3. [Note: I haven&apos;t played Starcraft in many years] In Starcraft, you observe by looking at the screen/minimap/other status indicators. You consider a select set of moves governed by your knowledge of strategy, what your opponent is doing, etc. You decide what to do based almost entirely on well trained heuristics/intuition. Acting is sometimes constrained by your ability to click properly, but generally you won&apos;t even consider actions that you know that you can&apos;t execute properly. Starcraft is played in real time - the rapidity at which you can execute your OODA loop matters because the other player is changing the environment as you think.</p><p>4. In climbing, you observe by looking at the wall and feeling the current position of your body. You consider a select set of motions informed by your earlier observation of the wall. You decide what to do based on some strange knowledge about how bodies move and how hands work. Acting requires that you move your muscles in the ways that you imagine in your head, which sometimes doesn&apos;t work, resulting in falling. While you&apos;re on a climbing wall, your strength is constantly being used to hold you on the wall - the speed of the OODA loop matters because you are part of the environment and your strength is changing over time. </p><h1>Failures</h1><p>I claim that the OODA loop provides a good taxonomy of 8 possible ways that agents fail to accomplish their goals in dynamically changing environments. The 8 possible ways are failures at each of the OODA steps and failures to properly transition between the steps.</p><h2>Failure to Observe</h2><p>A failure to observe is a failure to gather accurate, relevant information from the environment. </p><p>Examples:</p><p>1. I suck at chess. I suck so much that sometimes when I look at the chessboard, I don&apos;t see one of my opponents pieces.</p><p>2. When climbing, sometimes the hold is really dirty and I don&apos;t see it.</p><p>3. When playing MtG, sometimes I don&apos;t realize that something on the board is happening.</p><p>In general, if you have the wrong model of the environment, you will observe incorrectly.</p><h2>Failure to Orient</h2><p>A failure to orient is a failure to select a tractable set of high-quality actions. There is a classic bias-variance tradeoff here. If you have too many actions, your decision procedure isn&apos;t noiseless, so you&apos;ll have higher variance in outcomes. If you have too little actions, then the best action you select might not be very good.</p><p>Examples:</p><p>1. I suck at chess. Sometimes I have no idea what I&apos;m doing, so I just try to consider all possible actions. This doesn&apos;t work because I don&apos;t know what I&apos;m doing, so I end up taking basically a random action that isn&apos;t obviously terrible.</p><p>2. When playing MtG, if you don&apos;t know the rules of the game, sometimes you don&apos;t realize that there are certain actions that you can take.</p><p>3. When climbing, if you think you&apos;re stronger than you actually are, you&apos;ll consider actions that look good but you won&apos;t be able to do.</p><p>In general, if your model of your own agency in a given situation is wrong, it will cause you to orient incorrectly. </p><h2>Failure to Decide</h2><p>A failure to decide is a failure to select the best action in the action set you oriented towards. </p><p>Examples:</p><p>1. I suck at chess. Sometimes I think that capturing a piece locally is good, but don&apos;t realize that I&apos;ll lose the game 4 turns later.</p><p>2. When playing MtG, sometimes I&apos;ll think that the rules work one way so I&apos;ll think a play is good, but then it turns out the rules work a different way and I am sad.</p><p>In general, if your model of how you&apos;ll affect the environment or your value function over the environment is flawed, you will decide incorrectly.</p><h2>Failure to Act</h2><p>A failure to act is a failure to do the thing that you determined was the best action among all actions you considered given what you know about the environment. This failure is maybe the most &quot;human&quot; failure of them all. I find this failure the most frustrating because I could have just... done it?</p><p>Examples:</p><p>1. When trying do life properly, I observe what I want, orient towards the tasks that can get me what I want with what I have, decide on the best task to do, then spend an hour on reddit.</p><p>2. When climbing, sometimes my flesh betrays me and I cannot execute the move that I thought I could do, so I fall.</p><h2>Failure in Observe -&gt; Orient</h2><p>A failure to go from observing to orienting is a failure to know when you&apos;re supposed to act. Most of the time, direct action on your part is not required, so people spend a lot of time in the observation stage. Sometimes, something special happens which requires you to act but you don&apos;t realize, so you don&apos;t act.</p><p>Examples:</p><p>1. I observe that a cup of water is about to fall. I watch passively as it falls. I could have easily caught it, but didn&apos;t realize that catching the cup was a thing that I could do until after it already fell.</p><p>2. I observe that some people seem to dress nicer than other people. I fail to orient towards the possible ways that I can dress nicer, even though this is one of my desires.</p><p>3. In MtG, I observe that my opponent is doing something that I don&apos;t want them to do and that I can stop it. I fail to orient towards the action of actually stopping it.</p><h2>Failure in Orient -&gt; Decide</h2><p>A failure to go from orienting to deciding is a failure to realize that you have to stop searching for actions at some point.</p><p>Note: this failure only occurs if there&apos;s some sort of time pressure, which there basically always is. However, this means that increased time pressure makes this failure more likely.</p><p>Examples:</p><p>1. A human is trying to optimize their life. They spend all their time searching for possible optimizations and never decide which optimization is best.</p><p>2. In climbing, sometimes I hang on the wall thinking of possible moves to get to the next hold. Then my arms get tired and I fall.</p><h2>Failure in Decide -&gt; Act</h2><p>A failure to go from deciding to acting is a failure to ever stop trying to figure out the best action. I think that there is a failure mode among rationalists where they spend too much time trying to figure out what the best thing to do is and not enough time actually doing things.</p><p>Note: this failure only occurs if there&apos;s some sort of time pressure, which there basically always is. However, this means that increased time pressure makes this failure more likely.</p><p>Examples:</p><p>1. In Starcraft, I&apos;m trying to figure out what the best move to do is. I spend too long doing this and then I lose.</p><p>2. I&apos;m torn between two potential lovers. I spend a long time trying to figure out the various benefits of each person. They both leave me for taking to long to decide.</p><p>2. <a href=""https://xkcd.com/309/"">https://xkcd.com/309/</a></p><h2>Failure in Act -&gt; Observe</h2><p>A failure to go from acting to observation is a failure to realize that no plan survives contact with reality. There is a common failure mode where people only OODA once, deciding upon a course of action and then pursuing it, without realizing that the environment or their values might have changed since the decision.</p><p>Examples:</p><p>1. I once wanted to make mashed potatoes with a sous vide. If you don&apos;t know, a sous vide machine will cook potatoes without introducing extra water, so you can put in a bunch of butter and make the mashed potatoes taste super good. Our sous vide machine broke, so we had to cook the potatoes in a way that introduced water. However, we failed to re-observe, so we just put in the same amount of butter as we were planning on doing with the sous vide potatoes. Butter potato soup is not a great food.</p><p>2. In strategy games, sometimes I decide on a high level strategy at the beginning of the game and commit to it. During the game, my opponents figure out what I&apos;m doing and begin to counteract. Often times, I will not re-observe and choose a different strategy, instead barreling on and losing the game.</p><p>3. In MtG drafting, a common mistake is to commit to a drafting strategy and fail to re-observe when the strategy is going poorly.</p><h1>Getting Inside</h1><p>In combative situations, there is more than one OODA loop going on. Sometimes, one of the OODA loops is faster than the other one. We refer to this situation as &quot;getting inside their OODA loop.&quot; Such a situation results in what I call &quot;OODA dominance.&quot;  I claim that there are qualitatively two types of OODA dominance that can occur.</p><h2>Fast</h2><p>In fast OODA dominance, one of the agents is able to execute an entire OODA loop before the other agent is close to completing their OODA loop. This means that the faster agent can observe what observation the other agent made, then execute an entire OODA loop so that the slower agent is acting in an environment that it hasn&apos;t even observed. Crucially, the faster agent can act in a way that makes the slower agent&apos;s action completely useless or even counter-productive.</p><p>Examples:</p><p>1. In fencing, if you&apos;re much faster than your opponent, you can win without ever losing a single point by just waiting for your opponent to do anything, then just applying the appropriate counter-moves faster than they can respond.</p><p>2. In corporate world, if you&apos;re part of a nimble start-up, you can potentially outmaneuver larger corporations with much more resources because you can respond to the larger corporations maneuvers very quickly.</p><p>3. In the stock market, nimble generalists might be able to act faster than comparatively slow hedge funds and make money on expectation.</p><br><h2>Slow</h2><p>In slow OODA dominance, one of the agents OODA loops is only slightly faster than the other. This means that when the slower agent acts, their information about the environment will be slightly out of date, making their actions slightly less effective.

They ran benchmarks on two play  datasets which are used in a lot of papers (including many of the NAS  papers): PTB and CIFAR-10. Also, they seem to have at least attempted to  control for some of the inherent randomness:</p><blockquote>we run 10 experiments with a different initialization of the sampling policy.<br> </blockquote><p>Again, this might not sound like an ideal experiment from which one  can draw conclusive statements, but this is the ML literature I&#x2019;m  working with&#x2026; as far as I&#x2019;m concerned these guys are trying too hard.</p><p>Also, the <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/cycw35/r_random_search_outperforms_stateoftheart_nas/"">reddit discussion</a>  includes a bunch of people citing various papers and personal  experiences that have similar claims, but I couldn&#x2019;t be bothered to  follow up on those links.</p><p>Regardless, I think there&#x2019;s a good reason why they are trying so hard  to use best experimental practices, because the claims they are making,  taken at face value, seem quite outrageous:</p><p>The most popular architecture search methods (DARTS, NAO, ENAS and  Bayesian NAS) are no better than searching randomly. Not in the overall  accuracy of the best model, not in the accuracy variation depending on  the initial condition and (obviously) not in the time that it takes to  actually train.</p><p>Is it quite the same as trying to throw away the work of a few dozens  of Ph.D. thesis down the drain? Maybe not, they do seem to suggest some  ways of addressing the issue, or at least they identify some root  causes. But I&#x2019;m unsure, I&#x2019;m not an expert in this area&#x2026; and apparently,  most expert built algorithms are outperformed by coin tossing, so are  there even experts in this area ?.</p><p>Maybe there are certain datasets where NAS algorithms do perform  better than random, but regardless, I want to use this as an entry point  into a broader question: &#x201C;Should we and can we use random controls to  confirm theory validity?&#x201D;</p><h2>Theory as a search tool</h2><p>It seems that one of the chiefly roles of scientific theory, when  applied to the real world, is very similar to the role of NAS  algorithms, it&#x2019;s a tool for limiting search space.</p><p>Indeed, this can be said of almost any theory, other than those  modeling things like mathematics and formal logic. In those cases, the  theory is basically everything there is to it, there&#x2019;s no underlying  reality.</p><p>But for most theories, instead of using them to predict the world  without checking, we often predict the results of experiments, then run  those experiments to validate that the results are true.</p><p>For example, we might predict theoretically, that given 2cm extra of  fuselage on our plane: its top speed will go down by 50km/h ,its  resistance to impacts with swallows will increase to 4,788J/m^2, it&#x2019;s  behavior when encountering crosswinds of speed <code>x</code><br> will now be <code>y</code><br>&#x2026; etc.</p><p>But usually, at least as far as I&#x2019;ve been led to believe, all of  these theoretically sound conclusions are thoroughly tested. First by  experimenting on individual components, then on the fuselage as a whole  in a wind tunnel, then by building a few test planes and actually flying  them.</p><p>Granted, I think there are ways of doing research that don&#x2019;t fall  under this paradigm, but I think that many do. To put it in more  abstract terms, you have something like:</p><ol><li>Given solution search space S, use theory A in order to pick an ideal solution</li><li>Run experiments to validate the ideal solution.</li><li>If the solution fails, try theory B, or some variation in theory A,  go back to step 1&#x2026; rinse and repeat until step 2 succeeds OR.</li><li>If all theory fails, try using your experimental data and previous  experiment data to build a new theory, then go back to step 1.</li><li>Give up when you&#x2019;ve run out of funding.</li></ol><p>We have the theory acting upon the search space to find a solution  and implicitly an experiment that will help validate said solution.</p><p>What would a control for this process look like ?</p><p>Well, something like:</p><ol><li>Given solution search space S, sample a solution randomly.</li><li>Run experiments to validate the selected solution.</li><li>If the solution fails, go back to step 1 (make sure to sample a different solution this time).</li><li>Give up when you&#x2019;ve run out of funding.</li></ol><p>The one problem here is how you go about defining <code>S</code><br>. In our airplane example, if we are looking for a solution to &#x201C;how do we make this more resistant to impacts with birds&#x201D;; if <code>S</code><br>  contains all possible ideas, including: &#x201C;Paint it with tiger stripes&#x201D;  or &#x201C;Add a cotton candy machine&#x201D;. Then we will be sampling arbitrary  nonsense forever.</p><p>In a realistic scenario <code>S</code><br> would have to be defined as  something like &#x201C;The search space of all easy-to-implement changes which  based on common sense and have some relationship with the desired  outcome&#x201D;.</p><p>But, that might still allow for a solution like &#x201C;Make the fuselage  thicker by 50cm&#x201D;. So I think it&#x2019;s warranted to add something like: &#x201C;And  where the magnitude and range for any given parameter is closely matched  to the magnitude and range of that parameter or a very similar  parameter as used in other related experiments&#x201D;.</p><p>Or, less formally: &#x201C;The search space <code>S</code><br> contains all  common sense solutions which can be implemented and tested quickly and  easily given the current budget&#x201D; Where &#x201C;common sense&#x201D; is defined by  &#x201C;similar to things tried in other experiments aiming at similar topics&#x201D;  or &#x201C;implying a very small variation from the current setup&#x201D; or &#x201C;the  obvious possibility of a causal relationship between the parameter being  tweaked and the outcome&#x201D;.</p><p>Regardless of which of the definitions you prefer, I believe that, at  least from a high vantage point, this search space can be defined using  simple heuristics.</p><h2>Would this actually work ?</h2><p>So, for the sake of argument, let&#x2019;s assume that whenever a given  theory tells us to run a specific experiment, we also run a random  control experiment, can we gain any insight out of this ?</p><p>Well&#x2026; maybe, it&#x2019;s hard to tell, since a lot of experiments have  foregone conclusions, there are cases where a theory has close to ideal  predictive power.</p><p>For this method to shine through you&#x2019;d need to specifically select  for &#x201C;theories with a lot of edge cases&#x201D;. But if someone was to actually  apply this kind of method, that&#x2019;s the kind of theory they would try to  target anyway. I don&#x2019;t think anybody is contesting the accuracy of  inorganic chemistry or statics on the niches of the world they&#x2019;ve  claimed as their own.</p><p>Also, assuming some degree of &#x201C;common sense&#x201D;, or at least knowledge  of all previous related experiments is required to determine <code>S</code><br>, who would be tasked with determining it ? Wouldn&#x2019;t the experimenters be biased towards making <code>S</code><br> as unreasonably wide as possible, in order to defend from the possibility of their theory being just a statistical artifact ?</p><p>Again, maybe, but this kind of argument could be used to invalidate  most scientific research, we have to assume that on average the vast  majority of work is done with &#x201C;pure&#x201D; intentions.</p><p>Finally, what should you do assuming that this method actually works ?  Assuming that you do end up randomly sampling solutions and randomness  does about as well as theory.</p><p>Would anyone act on this ? I wouldn&#x2019;t think so. After all, many  fields are unable to make good predictions about the systems they  pretend to be modeling (see economics, sociology, psychology) and that  has proved to be no detraction.</p><p>Though it might be that physicists would act with a bit more care  then economists if they heard &#x201C;Random people on the street are able to  make forecasts about your object of study about as well, if not better,  than your theories&#x201D;.</p><p>Another interesting idea that stemmed from playing with this is  whether or not certain theories could be &#x201C;immune&#x201D; to being controlled  for.</p><p>Intuitively it seems that only a &#x201C;bad&#x201D; theory would offer no  possibility of a random control. In that, the control assumes there is  some search space and some problem, however, you could have a theory  where the problem is the theory itself.</p><p>In other words, you could be looking for data purely to validate or  expand the very theory that&#x2019;s being used to dictate the experiments  being done. In this case, randomly searching would be obviously worse.  But also, this kind of endeavor seems very flawed to begin with.</p><p>Overall I&#x2019;m pretty uncertain about this idea. It&#x2019;s one of those  things that seems so obvious that I&#x2019;m surprised I haven&#x2019;t heard it  mentioned by anyone before, at least not in a broader context, in  statistics, and ML controlling against random is a pretty familiar  concept. It might be that it only works with an oversimplified  definition of &#x201C;theory&#x201D; and &#x201C;experiment&#x201D; and it couldn&#x2019;t be applied to a  real research environment.</p>",George3d6,george3d6,George3d6,

Sometimes I'm in a Facebook discussion and someone says something they
wish they hadn't.  Maybe it turns out to be wrong, or misleading, or
insensitive.  One way I've seen this poorly handled is posting a
follow-up comment:

</span>

</p><p>

<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/fb-retraction-in-comment-thread-big.png""><img src=""https://www.jefftk.com/fb-retraction-in-comment-thread.png"" srcset=""https://www.jefftk.com/fb-retraction-in-comment-thread.png 550w, https://www.jefftk.com/fb-retraction-in-comment-thread-2x.png 1100w"" /></a>

</p>

<p>

The problem is that the top-level post is still there, and Facebook
will often choose to show it to people without showing them the
reply.  Or people will read the big text and skim over the reply.

</p>

<p>

At the other extreme, full deletion has different downsides:

</p>

<p>

<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/fb-retraction-deleted-post-big.png""><img src=""https://www.jefftk.com/fb-retraction-deleted-post.png"" srcset=""https://www.jefftk.com/fb-retraction-deleted-post.png 550w, https://www.jefftk.com/fb-retraction-deleted-post-2x.png 1100w"" /></a>

</p>

<p>

If you're deleting something with replies, those comments disappear,
even ones people may have put a lot of work into.  Plus people are
even less likely to know you retracted your claim.

</p>

<p>

For simple retractions, where once people know you don't endorse it
anymore it's no longer harmful, an edit can work well:

</p>

<p>

<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/fb-retraction-as-top-level-edit-big.png""><img src=""https://www.jefftk.com/fb-retraction-as-top-level-edit.png"" srcset=""https://www.jefftk.com/fb-retraction-as-top-level-edit.png 550w, https://www.jefftk.com/fb-retraction-as-top-level-edit-2x.png 1100w"" /></a>

</p>

<p>

It's not confusing, and people can still read the comments if the
discussion is helpful.

</p>

<p>

If you really don't want people to gloss over your retraction, you can
edit to remove it fully:

</p>

<p>

<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/fb-retraction-as-full-blanking-big.png""><img src=""https://www.jefftk.com/fb-retraction-as-full-blanking.png"" srcset=""https://www.jefftk.com/fb-retraction-as-full-blanking.png 550w, https://www.jefftk.com/fb-retraction-as-full-blanking-2x.png 1100w"" /></a>

</p>

<p>

If people really want to see the context, they can look at the edit
history:

</p>

<p>

<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/fb-retraction-show-edit-history-big.png""><img src=""https://www.jefftk.com/fb-retraction-show-edit-history.png"" srcset=""https://www.jefftk.com/fb-retraction-show-edit-history.png 550w, https://www.jefftk.com/fb-retraction-show-edit-history-2x.png 1100w"" /></a>

</p>

<p>

In extreme cases, like if you accidentally outed someone, changing the
privacy setting on your post to ""only me"" lets you keep anyone else
from seeing it:

</p>

<p>

<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/fb-retraction-privacy-only-me-big.png""><img src=""https://www.jefftk.com/fb-retraction-privacy-only-me.png"" srcset=""https://www.jefftk.com/fb-retraction-privacy-only-me.png 550w, https://www.jefftk.com/fb-retraction-privacy-only-me-2x.png 1100w"" /></a>

</p>

<p>

This way if someone has a comment they wrote that they'd like to still
have, they can write to you and ask for a copy.

</p>

<p>

If you have a comment in a nested thread where you need to clear the
edit history, delete your comment and post a
new one like ""I deleted my comment above because..."".

</p>

<p>

If you have a top-level comment you need to delete, there aren't any
great options.  The best you can do is manually screenshot the thread
in case someone asks for their comments, and then delete it.

</p>

<p>

<p><a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fG6Egvt6-h9DwYBXwAVHGT_gIznoYrvpcWjOT_jZmrc/edit?usp=sharing"">Spreadsheet I’m using to look at data is here, if you’d like to look.</a></p>
<p>Epistemic Status: Usual warning that I’m not an expert, just someone trying to figure things out as best he can, and am doubtless making tons of mistakes.</p>
<p>I’m going to try making this a weekly update while there are interesting things to say. I’ll update these thoughts as the week goes by, then publish each Friday.</p>
<p>There’s a whole bunch of different stuff going on. The sections play into my whole picture, but they’re also mostly distinct, so you can skip anything you don’t care about. This is the things I felt were sufficiently relevant to write down.</p>
<p>This is a weird post, because as I was finishing it up, Cuomo came out with antibody test results and that’s going to change everything. So these thoughts are what I got <em>before </em>the antibody tests and before the 4/23 data. Next time I’ll deal with the antibody results in full.</p>
<p><span></span></p>
<h3>What Is Happening?</h3>
<p>New York’s situation is rapidly improving. Other places in America, not so much. At a minimum, not so clear.</p>
<p>Previously I’ve been grouping New York and New Jersey, since New Jersey has the second-most infections and is right next to New York.</p>
<p>However, with New Jersey not getting better and New York rapidly improving, this no longer makes as much sense. I’m going to isolate only New York. I’ll still have the New Jersey columns and Ex-NJ columns, but I’ll move them off to the right in the spreadsheet.</p>
<p>New York alone peaked its positive test rate around 50%, and it’s now down to 26.8%. I don’t think we went <em>too </em>far above the point where test positive numbers stop increasing, and our testing is modestly increased since then but not dramatically so. Clearly things are <em>much </em>better. The naive calculation says down from peak by half, the second-level one says it’s somewhat more than that but hard to tell how much more.</p>
<p>We cut things somewhat more than in half in 22 days. If we assume serial interval of 5 days, which seems like the minimum, that’s 4.4 intervals. Then we get an average R0 for this period of about 0.85. Serial interval might be substantially longer, but can’t be much shorter. Our reasonably confident bounds are therefore something like 0.75 to 0.9. The more I look at it, the harder it is to be at any other number.</p>
<p>What happens if we use this to try and back out the situation?</p>
<p>If we start with 474 deaths on 4/22 and assume a 50% undercount (to 717) and 23 day delay and a 1% death rate, we get on 3/30 there being something like 71,700 infections on that day, which was around peak of positive tests, so we can maybe say that New York had about 70,000 infections per day at the peak, then, as an alternative calculation method that now seems available to us. Then we use the ratios of test results of different days, and a maximally generous 3.5 day doubling time (I tried 2.5 first and the problems below were even worse) before the lock down, and see what pops out.</p>
<p>That gives us 1.92 million infections so far, and 32,161 real infections today. It only gives us 1.04mm infections or so that have existed for 23 days, and the number of deaths is now 14,828 even without an under-count, which implies a 2% IFR with the same adjustment for undercount. Check sum fail, since we assumed 1%. We’d need to split the difference in some form and accept ~1.5% IFR due to hospitals being overwhelmed during this period, or adjust our assumptions somewhere.</p>
<p>Alternatively, we can move the doubling time back to 2.5 days, force the IFR to be 1% based on that <em>second </em>calculation – the infected 23 days ago are the potentially dead now – and use that to generate the infection counts. That seems more promising, since the check sum should pass, and we’re now less sensitive to day-to-day data fluctuations.</p>
<p>That gets us 4.3 million infected in New York State total, and today’s number of infected at on 4/22 at 70,910. The one day peak was then around 150,000. We would then expect (if current policy holds until full squashing and there are no herd immunity adjustments) to see another 2.3 million infected from here, for 6.6 million total. We’d expect 66,000 deaths of which somewhat more than 44,000 would get reported.</p>
<p>That still doesn’t explain the <em>peak in deaths </em>being so early on 4/9, as 23 days before that was 3/16, and there’s actual no way in hell we peaked new infections that early. We could claim the real peak in deaths was 4/14, though, on the theory that hospitals were overwhelmed and thus the under counts got bigger. If we do that we get peak infections at 3/21, which starts to make more sense. More likely, this new 23 days number I picked up as consensus is a little too high, and it’s more like the old 21 days. Let’s make that adjustment instead, which gives us two more days of infections to help account for current deaths, and thus reduces our numbers a little. We can cut our numbers by ~15%</p>
<p>Doing everything again I get 3.72 million current infections and 1.92 future infections, which means a total of 56,400 deaths in New York for this wave if we don’t open prematurely.</p>
<p>That would make the infection rate in New York State overall about 19% now and 29% when things are finished. We’d have identified 13.3% of positive cases as of right now, with <em>vastly </em>inadequate testing.</p>
<p>This would also imply New York City was roughly 30% infected, which is on the extreme low end of my previous prior guess range.</p>
<p>All right, that story seems reasonable, with room to adjust it a bit if some of the assumptions prove wrong. But it does seem like it broadly fits before we see the antibody numbers.</p>
<p>Antibody tests came back 13.85% positive. 21.2% for NYC (43% of state population), 14.4% for Long Island (16.7% of state population), 9.8% for Westchester and Rockland (11.7% of state), then 3.6% for everywhere else (32.8% of state population).</p>
<p>We’ll pick up from there next time. The stories don’t seem that incompatible, but there’s definitely a gap to explain/reconcile.</p>
<p>Now, some still-relevant thoughts I wrote down earlier in the week.</p>
<h3>Model Talk</h3>
<h4><a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2020/04/11/seemingly-popular-covid-19-model-is-obvious-nonsense/"">Seemingly Popular Covid-19 Model is Now Even More Obvious Nonsense</a></h4>
<p>There was a headline on 4/22 that experts are warning that ‘leading model projects 66,000 deaths, up 10% from before, so we should wait longer to reopen.’ This is, of course, obviously insane. The 10% rise is a blip. It represents three or four days of deaths at current rates (before adjusting for undercounts).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the projection of 66k deaths comes with almost 46k deaths already observed <em>and the highest one day death count being yesterday 4/21, </em>as of 4/22. How is this not obviously utterly insane? Why is anyone using this for <em>anything? </em>That’s not only impossible, it’s obvious-to-the-naked-eye impossible.</p>
<p>I wonder how I should update about calling things out for being wrong. In general I think calling things out for being wrong is a mistake, hence my proviso that I expected to regret it. But it is now clear that this needed to be called out much faster and louder. I need to figure out the right policy. The <a href=""https://www.statnews.com/2020/04/17/influential-covid-19-model-uses-flawed-methods-shouldnt-guide-policies-critics-say/"">Stat News takedown piece</a> on this study seems to have been net useful despite being kind of terrible.</p>
<h4><a href=""https://covid-19.tacc.utexas.edu/projections/"">University of Texas Confident Death Peak Passed Before It Did, What’s Happening There?</a></h4>
<p>Several people who seem to be at least somewhat trying to think about Covid-19 have pointed to the University of Texas projections. When updated on 4/20, they had a 99% chance we were passed the peak in deaths. That number had been 99% for several days already, so it was likely much more confident than that but not showing extra signifigant figures. Then on 4/21 we had the highest one day death count so far.</p>
<p>Here is their brief explanation of what they are doing:</p>
<blockquote><p>Key model assumptions: (1) The observed and projected numbers reflect <b>confirmed</b> COVID-19 deaths only. (2) The model estimates the extent of social distancing using geolocation data from mobile phones and assumes that the extent of social distancing does not change during the period of forecasting. (3) The model is designed to predict deaths resulting from only a single wave of COVID-19 transmission and cannot predict epidemiological dynamics resulting from a possible second wave.</p>
<p>The peak is defined as the day on which our model’s prediction for the average daily death rate stops increasing and begins to decrease.</p>
<p>For detailed technical information please view the <a href=""http://www.tacc.utexas.edu/ut_covid-19_mortality_forecasting_model_report"" target=""_blank"">Report: UT COVID-19 Mortality Forecasting Model.</a></p></blockquote>
<p>They define peak as the model’s projection of the peak, rather than the actual peak. Which makes it a lot easier to be confident in something! Especially when a ‘second wave’ does not count, which you can interpret any number of ways. Still, it seems <em>highly </em>misleading and the people using the model are not going to interpret or use it the technically correct way.</p>
<p>In some ways I am sympathetic to ‘people are not using the model properly’ but I’m more sympathetic to ‘people are using the model exactly the way my model of people using models says people will use models given what we released and how we talked about it’ so maybe it’s on you to fix that or accept the responsibility for the consequences.</p>
<p>The approach of the Texas model is a direct response to criticism of the Nonsense Model (technically it’s called the IHME model) and the assumption that social distancing would be effective. Here’s their more technical summary of what’s going on:</p>
<blockquote><p>In light of the popular appeal of the IHME model and considerable scrutiny<br />
from the scientific community, we have developed an alternative curve-fitting<br />
method for forecasting COVID-19 mortality throughout the US. Our model is<br />
similar in spirit to the IHME model, but different in two important details.<br />
1. For each US state, we use local data from mobile-phone GPS traces made<br />
available by SafeGraph to quantify the changing impact of social-distancing<br />
measures on “flattening the curve.” SafeGraph is a data company that aggregates anonymized location data from numerous applications in order<br />
to provide insights about physical places. To enhance privacy, SafeGraph<br />
excludes census block group information if fewer than five devices visited<br />
an establishment in a month from a given census block group.<br />
2. We reformulated the approach in a generalized linear model framework to<br />
correct a statistical flaw that leads to the underestimation of uncertainty in<br />
the IHME forecasts.<br />
The incorporation of real-time geolocation data and several key modifications<br />
yields projections that differ noticeably from the IHME model, especially regarding uncertainty when projecting COVID-19 deaths several weeks into the<br />
future.</p></blockquote>
<p>That’s… an improvement, I guess?</p>
<p>Number two is certainly good news as far as it goes, but doesn’t go close to far enough. The Texas model still obviously has way too little uncertainty.</p>
<p>The problem is the models are only counting the uncertainty from some sources, such as random fluctuations. They’re not taking into account potential model error, or systematic things of any kind that might be going on that they’ve missed, or the general ability of the world to surprise us. They’re not properly taking into account uncertainty over the quality of our tests and tools, when that matters, which is what sunk the study in Santa Clara. Nor are they using common sense.</p>
<p>Again, there’s nothing <em>technically </em>wrong with saying something like “<a href=""https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfMyCalculationsAreCorrect"">If my assumptions and calculations are correct</a>, then the confidence interval would be…” in a world in which your assumptions are not going to be correct (as long as you don’t include the inevitable “and they are…”) but it’s going to give a very false impression to essentially everyone.</p>
<p>There are some very nice graphs of cell phone location data in the paper that’s linked to in their summary. It would be great if there was a way to look at that data more generally, seems pretty useful. <a href=""https://www.safegraph.com/dashboard/covid19-commerce-patterns"">And it is</a>! Looking forward (as of writing this section) to doing a deep dive on that soon. Many thanks for that, University of Texas.</p>
<p>Essentially, this seems like it takes a model full of obvious nonsense, notices <em>some </em>of that obvious nonsense, and replaces it with things that are less obviously nonsense slash less nonsensical.</p>
<p>It still ends up hyper overconfident. It still has a curve downwards that looks symmetrical to the curve upwards, which is not going to happen – common sense says that if R0 was 3 before, the only way to decline at the same rate is to get R0 down to 1/3, and that is obviously, obviously not something that happened. We’d see it in the data.</p>
<p>In practice, I think that using the Texas model will result in <em>slightly </em>better decisions than the full nonsense model, but it is still very much better off ignored. Except for its data  source, which seems highly useful.</p>
<h4><a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/16fhm4DbYFKKKywmvCBtjWfdqjo-ZPx6E/view"">How to Even Set Up The SEIRD Epidemic Model for Covid-19?</a></h4>
<p>A paper plausibly attempted to address that question on 4/20, so I figured I’d go through it. As my readers know, I’ve been very critical of the SEIR framework. In particular, I hate the assumption that everyone is the same and has the same interactions and exposures. That assumption seems to be sufficiently wrong as to make the model results bear little resemblence to reality.</p>
<p>Here’s the paper abstract, to which I added paragraph breaks:</p>
<blockquote><p>This paper studies the SEIRD epidemic model for COVID-19. First, I show that the<br />
model is poorly identified from the observed number of deaths and confirmed cases. There are many sets of parameters that are observationally equivalent in the short run but lead to markedly different long run forecasts.</p>
<p>Next, I show that the basic reproduction number R0 can be identified from the data, conditional on the clinical parameters. I then estimate it for the US and several other countries and regions, allowing for possible underreporting of the number of cases.</p>
<p>The resulting estimates of R0 are heterogeneous across countries: they are 2-3 times higher for Western countries than for Asian countries. I demonstrate that if one fails to take underreporting into account and estimates R0 from the reported cases data, the resulting estimate of R0 will be biased downward and the resulting forecasts will exaggerate the number of deaths.</p>
<p>Finally, I demonstrate that auxiliary information from random tests can be used to calibrate the initial parameters of the model and reduce the range of possible forecasts about the future number of deaths.</p></blockquote>
<p>I <em>still </em>see no mention of people not being identical <em>within </em>a region. We do see the acknowledgment that different regions are dramatically different.</p>
<p>Still, at the <em>beginning </em>of the epidemic, when approximately no one is immune, the calculations should be close enough to reality to be useful despite this huge error. Getting the parameters right, especially initial R0, seems central to the puzzle, so attempts to do that seem good even in the service of something that will over time become nonsense.</p>
<p>Interestingly this paper seems to think R0’s plausible range is much higher in the USA than previous estimates, partly because it’s much higher here than in Asia:</p>
<blockquote><p>There is no agreement in the medical literature on the length of the<br />
incubation and infectious period for COVID-19, different values of these parameters result in the estimates of R0 for the US that range from 3.75 to 11.6.</p></blockquote>
<p>This later gets narrowed down a bunch by using Iceland’s pseudo-random testing data.</p>
<p>An initial R0 that is much higher than the 4.0 I was using would help explain why containment is proving difficult. The paper claims that all these initial R0s are able to fit the data seen so far, and yield similar short-term models in terms of observed variables. Given how many things depend on so many other things, that seems like it’s a failure to observe enough variables?</p>
<p>It’s good to get concrete attempts to get the <em>range </em>of <em>possible </em>values for key variables. The paper claims average incubation is from 3 to 5 days, and that average disease duration is from 5 to 18 days, if you take the high and low estimates among estimates in the literature. That doesn’t seem like a safe way to get bounds on variables, but it’s a start.</p>
<p>The input parameters are confirmed cases and deaths. I would like to see systematic attempts to model true positive rates from positive test rates, since it’s clearly useful information and it is being ignored in these types of models.</p>
<p>This would hopefully solve the problem that is next pointed out, which is that if you can vary the initial case count, observable fraction of infections (oh boy the constants we’re assuming), R0 and CFR, you can get scenarios that look identical for a <em>long </em>time. You only find out the difference later, when you hit herd immunity effects. As I’ve said, I think those effects happen sooner, which would make the differences also show up sooner – if we don’t see New York’s implied R0 dropping substantially, that’s evidence against my interpretation of events and we’ll need to figure out where the mistake was, whereas if New York’s R0 seems to be continuing to drop a bunch then that would be evidence for my interpretation.</p>
<p>And of course, we’d see different responses to social distancing and other ways of making R0 drop. Reducing R0 by 75% via distancing without any substantial herd immunity, and ending up with a steady infection rate, tells you R0 = 4 initially. If you end up with dropping infections, it was less. If you end up with increasing infections, it was more. Not that the 75% number is easy to measure.</p>
<p>I’m sad that there haven’t been more concrete attempts (at least that are known to me) to do this type of physical modeling. A lot of variables have tight relationships with other variables, so having even reasonable bounds on how much we cut R0 in percentage terms would be a big game. But of course, there are tons and tons of opportunities for good data and we miss out on almost all of them.</p>
<p>(I’d also note that I hate that papers reguarly use tons of greek letters to represent their variables instead of repeatedly saying what they are slash not producing an easy glossary; I know it’s easier from a technical perspective, but from a layman’s perspective it makes life much more annoying.)</p>
<p>In theory he claims we can still figure out R0 from the curvature of the numbers. All we have to do is know the incubation time, the infectiousness time and that the numbers are only off by constant factors – if deaths or infections are always off by a fixed percentage that’s all right, as long as it’s a constant. It’s weird that the model uses incubation time and infectiousness time rather than serial interval, since those two variables don’t <em>seem </em>like they determine serial interval and that’s essentially what they’re being used for. The relative infectiousness in different periods, and relative patterns of behavior, matter, which is another thing being ignored.</p>
<p>Section 5 reports his estimation methods. It is amsuing that he notes there are no error terms in SEIR models, and that thus he can’t match the observed data exactly, so he just tries to do curve fitting. Given the circumstances, I’m willing to accept this is, if not the best we can do, at least a reasonable attempt to 80/20 it rather than dive further.</p>
<p>He gets very high R in the USA, for example in his “medium” scenario he gets 6.5 overall and 7 for New York, as opposed to 2 for Japan. The problem is that 6.5 and 7 are very close to the same number in practice, so it does not explain how things got so out of hand in New York and not elsewhere. Nor does it seem big enough for the obvious physical handicapps New Yorkers face in trying not to get infected. Density is <em>much, much </em>higher and presents tons of unique obstacles. Whereas the 2 for Japan is dramatically different and it seems hard to believe that doesn’t involve a lot of baseline distancing and prevention if it’s remotely real. Can this be apples to apples?</p>
<p>Social distancing’s effect is beyond the scope of the paper so the projections it gives into the future don’t matter here, and I’m ignoring them entirely. The Iceland note is only for the purpose of pointing out that random sample testing would allow us to narrow our hypothesis space. That seems to be <em>far more </em>true in reality than with the model, because reality allows you to use the answer from random testing to pin a lot of other things down and allow that to cascade.</p>
<p>Mostly this paper seemed like a cautionary tale with additional things that are wrong with SEIR frameworks in the context of Covid-19. They have tons of variables and it takes a long time into the progression of the epidemic to be able to fix them into place reasonably. That’s in addition to the model making incorrect assumptions, which seem big enough that by the time you <em>could </em>differentiate, you’ll do it wrong.</p>
<p>My basic conclusion is that SEIR is not a useful model going forward. It can’t do anything we can’t do better by using more basic methods.</p>
<p>I find that to be true of complicated models in general. Once they get <em>very close </em>to accurate, they start to be great. But until that point, you’re going to get answers that are mostly not useful compared to using simpler heuristics that are more robust. The complex model is set up to profit from solving the complex problem to get at hidden stuff, but to do that you’d better get <em>almost everything </em>right or learn how to sidestep it.</p>
<h3>Papers, Please</h3>
<h4><a href=""https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3080771/coronavirus-mutations-affect-deadliness-strains-chinese-study"">New study with claims of meaningful mutation in Covid-19</a></h4>
<p>Claim is that European strain, which is also in New York (and I’m going to presume New Jersey and other surrounding areas as well, because physics), is deadlier than the strain elsewhere, generating orders of magnitude more viral load.</p>
<p>I doubt this effect is dramatic, but it is certainly possible. Can we check for plausibility?</p>
<p>One sanity check is that the CFR (case fatality rate) is 5.6% for NY/NJ vs. 4.3% for USA ex-NY/NJ (as of 4/20). New York is under-testing by more than elsewhere because its positive rate is much higher. New York also reached its peak substantially earlier. New York also had overwhelmed hospitals more than elsewhere, and denying testing to less symptomatic people more aggressively than elsewhere.</p>
<p>Combining these factors, it seems clear that there isn’t much room for this type of effect unless there is a compensating factor somewhere. New York is younger and arguably healthier but the effect isn’t big enough.</p>
<p>So while a different viral load <em>in vitro </em>is certainly suggestive, I’m going to be doubtful that there’s much impact here, until I see more evidence. It’s still a potential variable that we can move around.</p>
<p>But what if it was true? What would it mean? There are three implications I can think of, if this is accurate. But is it real?</p>
<p>The first implication is that if Europe and New York have a deadlier strain then the true infection counts are lower than we thought in those areas, because the only way to reasonably calculate infection rates is backing them out from the death counts. Or, alternatively viewed, that the rest of the United States has a less deadly strain, and its infection counts are higher. Or both.</p>
<p>New York’s infection rates being lower would be important because the herd immunity effects are definitely substantial in any scenario, and their magnitude is a bound on various other measurements. The ‘good news’ is that I’ve already been using a 1% IFR as my basis for calculations as a conservative guess, so there’s room for the strain to be worse and that guess to not be that wrong. The fact that herd immunity grows much faster than the idealized calculation is still mostly going to carry the day under any plausible hypothesis.</p>
<p>The second implication is that <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2020/04/01/taking-initial-viral-load-seriously/"">variolation</a> could allow us to infect people with the least deadly strain. We add another potential variable to initial viral load. If the difference is dramatic, this could easily tip the scales. That’s how I discovered the study, as Robin Hanson wanted to know about this potential implication.</p>
<p>The third implication would, unfortunately, would be that it is less likely that initial viral load is that important. That’s the common sense of one strain multiplying much faster, and thus presumably having a much higher initial viral load, yet only having a somewhat higher death rate than the milder strain. A factor of three here simply isn’t plausible. It would break all sorts of calculations and studies that now make sense.</p>
<h4><a href=""https://observablehq.com/@danyx/estimating-sars-cov-2-infections"">Flashback: Estimating Infections From Confirmed Deaths</a></h4>
<p>This is a site I found relatively early, that uses a simple calculation of 23 days from infection to death, with an IFR of 1% It then allows you to play with how rapidly the virus spreads before and after lock down. I found it useful early in my thinking, and I now do a similar version of the same thing.</p>
<p>Given this uses official deaths, we know we’re going to add about 50% here to adjust for the official undercount.</p>
<p>Then the calculation assumes that under lock down, infections double once every 23 days. Using this, you get a result of 11.4 million Americans being infected on 4/21, or just over 3%. This implicitly assumes something like R0 = 1 with a serial interval of five days, and that the calculation starts with about half of people ever infected still infected now.</p>
<p>Of course, that means this calculation stops working once we’re a few days into the lock down, since the percentage of ever infected currently infected starts crashing even if R0 = 1, making the doubling time take longer since we’re doubling something that doesn’t actually mean anything. We’re basing off the wrong number here.</p>
<h3>Escape From New York</h3>
<p>My broker is the latest person to provide intelligence on what’s going on in Manhattan and elsewhere in NYC. The report is that <em>most </em>of the people in better off areas have left. This matches other observations. One client is one of four left in her building and has exclusive use of the (therefore safe) in-building gym. The broker’s building is about 20% full. And so on.</p>
<p>When you look at the low rates of infection in Manhattan, you need to remember that those rates use a very wrong denominator.</p>
<p>The contrast with poorer areas in other boroughs is stark. Many of the hardest hit places in Queens, Brooklyn and The Bronx everyone is outside and no one is wearing a mask.</p>
<h3>The New York City Subway: Menace or Scapegoat?</h3>
<p>When I offered a simple model of New York City, I used the two categories of subway riders and non-riders.</p>
<p>I did not do this primarily on the basis of a map (it’s suggestive, but not more than that), or a statistical study.</p>
<p>I did this on the basis of <em>are you freaking kidding me and have you seen the subway?</em></p>
<p>Subways are effectively enclosed spaces where social distancing is (at least at rush hour, and in some trains pretty much always) impossible and you mix with a random cross-section of people who are also doing the same thing.</p>
<p>Now <a href=""http://web.mit.edu/jeffrey/harris/HarrisJE_WP2_COVID19_NYC_13-Apr-2020.pdf"">there is a paper</a> that says that the subways seeded the epidemic. The paper says some things and points out some graphs, but doesn’t give strong evidence of what is happening.</p>
<p>Thus there are some responses to the paper.</p>
<p>In less exciting news, we have a blogger <a href=""https://pedestrianobservations.com/2020/04/15/the-subway-is-probably-not-why-new-york-is-a-disaster-zone/?fbclid=IwAR0f5Xb06Ie7cLNZCZ7n2Dg3lnk1TUGnjQAxcnvbQ8bFBGTJcHOICna8plM"">who does a tear-down of the paper.</a> The points made are fair, as far as they go. It’s good to point out that someone’s arguments are not great. The worry is the implied attitude. That attitude and the accompanying title, “The Subway is Probably Not Why New York City is a Disaster Zone” is emblematic of the attitude that until you prove something with p&lt;0.05 with explicit evidence from a proper experiment, knowledge cannot exist.</p>
<p>The <a href=""https://marketurbanism.com/2020/04/19/automobiles-seeded-the-massive-coronavirus-epidemic-in-new-york-city/"">other post</a> attempts to make a statistical case that it’s cars, rather than subways, that are responsible. Automobile and subway transit shares are such close mirror images (correlation of -0.88) that when you use both in a correlation, one of them will end up with a near-zero coefficient. It turns out that when you run the correlations, subways stops and local infection rates are negatively correlated, whereas cars and infection rates are positively correlated. There are also a bunch of Asian and European cities with mass transit systems people can actually use, because such nations care about good mass transit, and which don’t have higher rates than surrounding areas.</p>
<p>Which, of course, is all pretty freaking weird. If there’s one thing New York <em>doesn’t </em>have lots of relative to other places it would be cars. Less than half (1.4mm of 3.1mm) of New York households own even one vehicle. In America, 90% of households have at least one, and the mean is 1.88 vehicles. If automobiles “seeded the New York” epidemic <em>then there wouldn’t be one.</em></p>
<p>Combine that with driving a car being obviously safe, whereas taking mass transit is obviously unsafe.</p>
<p>So we have a correlational argument for an impossible result. Which means that it’s almost certainly not causation. Something correlated with cars <em>within the city of New York </em>is causing problems.</p>
<p>The obvious answer is that subways are a proxy for being in Manhattan, cars are a proxy for being far from Manhattan, and Manhattan’s situation isn’t actually that bad. The other buroughs have it much worse. That’s presumably because Manhattan is full of wealthy people who fled in large numbers and those who are left can more easily work from home. There’s a speculation that it is also that those without cars tend to stay close and see very local people, which means overlapping and thus safer social graphs, which I find an interesting proposal.</p>
<p>Author claims they deleted Manhattan and ran the correlation, and the correlation was still there, although the numbers aren’t provided.</p>
<p>Outside of Manattan, presumably subways remain a proxy for <em>wealth. </em>It costs money to live near the subway. Those who value their time pay up, those who don’t or can’t, find other transportation. So the same basic dynamics could easily be in play either way.</p>
<p>Regardless, I cannot believe that the subways aren’t a major contributor to the epidemic. The rate of infection among transit workers is as high as you’d expect. And also I believe in a physical world and the germ theory of disease. I mean, <em>come on.</em></p>
<p>I find this a fascinating cautionary tale about correlation.</p>
<p>I also do think one has to downweight somewhat the role of the subway versus my previous model.</p>
<p>If that’s true, what does it imply? What would it mean if the New York subway <em>wasn’t </em>a major danger?</p>
<p>It would mean that <em>the types of risk that you take on the subway </em>are not major risks! And that would be true <em>even before social distancing and other precautions.</em></p>
<p>Touching surfaces that other people touch? I have some news about how the subway works.</p>
<p>Being less than six feet apart in an enclosed space? Even touching them? I have some news about how the subway works.</p>
<p>So what’s missing from the subway that’s <em>not </em>missing from other stories of how people all get infected?</p>
<p>Talking. People on the subway don’t talk.</p>
<p>And remember that choir practice where everyone distanced and it didn’t matter?</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<h3>Reopening Gambits</h3>
<p>We are seeing partial reopenings and announced pending partial reopenings in a variety of states, including Florida, Kentucky and Georgia. The thinking behind this seems to be something like this, this is <em>not </em>a strawman as far as I can tell.</p>
<p>The official guideline is that you can start reopening if there is a ’14 day decline’ in positive cases. So you have to do something that causes your problem to get less bad, prove it’s less bad, and then you can… stop doing it so it can get bad again?</p>
<p><em>Many, and perhaps most, people think that if things are improving, that means the worst is over and things will soon be fine. We can begin to reopen and relax.</em></p>
<p>This, of course, is crazy town.</p>
<p>And yet, it seems to be common on all levels. In New York, Cuomo keeps hammering “we have to stay vigilant” over and over again, because he knows that the public will interpret being “past the peak” as a reason to stop being vigilant, and perhaps cause another peak. Where the incentives are less aligned, things get that much worse.</p>
<p>We then combine that with the principle that whenever the doomsayer is listened to and the necessary actions taken, that person will look wrong, and we have a serious problem. Which the terrible models are helping to compound.</p>
<p>The ‘good news’ is that these experiments will be valuable. The states, as I noted last time, will not simply reopen. They will legally partially reopen, and people will continue to take precautions above and beyond what is required of them. It will be fascinating to see what will actually happen when people are given permission to return to work. How many will do so? What would fully voluntary behavior look like? And of course, would that behavior work to contain the virus?</p>
<p>The criteria should be, <em>of course, </em>evidence that R0 is sufficiently below 1 that you can reopen and keep R0 below 1, <em>or </em>your case count is sufficiently low that you can afford to do ‘the dance’ of The Hammer and the Dance for a while.</p>
<p>We’re also seeing <em>really stupid </em>reopening methods.</p>
<p>If you’re going to do a partial reopening, I am pretty sure tattoo parlors and gyms are really bad choices to single out in a one sentence statement. That happened.</p>
<p>If you’re going to have your beaches reopened, limiting their hours is not going to make them less crowded. Unless you’re prepared to ration tickets, either close, or don’t close. If anything, <em>extending </em>the hours is probably better. Let people distance in time and give them a way to avoid getting stir crazy.</p>
<p>The protests are strange. To what extent are they real versus astroturfed? As usual, hard to tell. Certainly a lot of people want to get back to work and think what we are doing isn’t worth it. Some of them think that because they don’t fully grok what Covid-19 is and what it is capable of doing. Some of them think that because freedom. Others are making a sensible judgment that depression level economic suffering is really, really bad.</p>
<p>I also don’t have a sense of how many people are at these protests, but I’m confident they are going to have high rates of infection. If people keep protesting, they <em>will </em>get exposed enough to infect them, given how they are intentionally not distancing while protesting from what we can see. Could easily prove self-defeating.</p>
<p>Given the slow pace of decline in new cases, at least some amount of a second wave therefore seems all but inevitable in areas unwilling to maintain distancing and that have yet to acquire substantial herd immunity, such as those currently reopening. It won’t have the same velocity as the first one, but it will happen.</p>
<p>Thus, the continued market optimism seems to be very aggressive. I am an optimist about many aspects of the situation, but very worried that the market is missing the same thing as everyone else.</p>

b988iuyNQNZJMwoDP,Do you trust the research on handwriting vs. typing for notes? ,do-you-trust-the-research-on-handwriting-vs-typing-for-notes,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/b988iuyNQNZJMwoDP/do-you-trust-the-research-on-handwriting-vs-typing-for-notes,2020-04-23T20:49:19.731Z,25,10,18,False,True,,"<html><head></head><body><p>For a while now, I've heard the claim that ""studies show"" that note-takers remember content better if they take notes by hand versus on a computer. I previously took this claim on face value in part because this was before I'd heard about the replication crisis and also because I'd had personal experiences that I believed supported this claim.</p>
<p>In light of the replication crisis and recent experiences, I've come to be more skeptical of this research. I started to look at <a href=""https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/5bf4/2fb40ab80fbb0c8f2f54796e1c17a3ccee26.pdf"">some of the research pop science articles on the topic cite</a> and am skeptical of the work I've looked at so far.</p>
<p>In the example I link to above, they have subjects perform two tasks, a recall and recognition task for words they handwrote or typed with a multiplication task in between writing and recalling/recognizing. They find a not significant difference between recalled words for handwriting vs. typing and a barely (p-value .03) significant difference between recognized words for the two groups. However, if you look at the standard deviations for the means for the two tasks, you'll see that each mean is in the other's 1-SD range.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the task they describe is simple but not necessarily that relevant to what's really going on when someone takes notes on a lecture / talk. They intentionally used semantically meaningless words (for understandable reasons) whereas real-life talks hopefully have higher-level meaning and themes.</p>
<p>ETA (after initial posting): Just found <a href=""https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/sites.udel.edu/dist/6/132/files/2010/11/Psychological-Science-2014-Mueller-0956797614524581-1u0h0yu.pdf"">another paper</a> that a few pop-sci articles seem to cite. This paper covers three experiments, which are all more realistic than the one I described above. I'm only going to discuss the first here.</p>
<p>The first had participants watch TED talks, take notes on them (either on a laptop or by hand) and then answer a combination of ""factual"" and ""conceptual"" questions about them. At a high level, they interpret the results of this experiment as showing that laptop note-takers did as well as the by hand note-takers on factual questions but worse on conceptual questions. (However, this is only the case after they convert to z-scores. That is, the differences between raw grades are not significant.) They also find that a difference between laptop note-takers and by hand note-takers is that the laptop note-takers write more and tend to copy the lecturers words more exactly. When they control for these factors, they find a much weaker effect of note-taking medium. Their latter experiments basically try and disentangle how much note-taking medium vs. following best practices matters (interested readers can read the paper). Overall, I'd say this study maybe causes me to update a little in the direction of typing having a downside all else equal but mostly just confirms my prior that synthesizing and not just copying what the lecturer says matter more.</p>
<p>After seeing this, I thought, ""maybe there are a lot of studies that together make a stronger case."" However, I randomly sampled a few articles on the topic and they all linked to <s>this one</s> these two <s>study</s> studies!</p>
<p>Unless I spend more time digging into the science, I'm left to trust my own experience, which has been mixed. I do find handwriting notes is nice for the flexibility it allows for drawing diagrams, structuring things on the page, etc. However, I write really slowly and therefore have to compress what I'm writing as much as possible. This can be a benefit (and is the one the articles I read claim) if it means I'm internalizing the material better but also means that if I don't understand something well, I often don't have to time to write down the details of my confusion. Furthermore, I have a habit of never looking back at my handwritten notes unless I'm diligent about indexing them, whereas with typed notes, I can use search to find exactly what I'm looking for.</p>
<p>So, this leaves me interested in answers to the following two questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Have you read the research on typing vs. handwriting? If so, do you find it compelling / trustworthy? (Links to good studies encouraged!)</li>
<li>What have you concluded from your personal experience?</li>

The tone of this article, and some of the content, may constitute self-punishment behavior, signaling, or frustration rather than genuine belief.</p>
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>I'm currently a male second-year undergrad in computer science. I am not clinically depressed. My first exposure to the rationalist community was largely limited to reading HPMOR and ~40% of the original Sequences around 2013-2014; I've had rationalist/EA friends continuously since then; in mid-2019 I started following LW; in March 2020 I read almost every scrap of COVID-19 content. I'm not sure how to evaluate my strength as a rationalist, but I feel epistemically slightly weaker than the average LW commenter and guess that my applied skills are average for non-rationalists of my demographic.</p>
<p>Others described the phenomenon of the ""rationalist uncanny valley"" or ""valley of bad rationality"" as early as 2009:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Valley_of_bad_rationality"">It has been observed that when someone is just starting to learn rationality, they sometimes appear to be worse off than they were before.</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've known about the rationalist uncanny valley since 2013, and was willing to accept some temporary loss in effectiveness. Indeed, before March 2020, the damage to my everyday life was small and masked by self-improvement. However, with isolation, my life has ground to a halt, in part due to ""rationalist uncanny valley"" failure modes, and failures I'm predisposed to which rationality training has exacerbated. Looking back, one of these also happened during my exposure to the community in 2014. This post is an attempt to characterize the negative effects exposure to rationality has had on my life, and is not representative of the overall effect.</p>
<h1>Examples</h1>
<h2>1. Bad form when reading LW material</h2>
<p>I'm very competitive and my self-worth is mostly derived from social comparison, a trait which at worst can cause me to value winning over maintaining relationships, or cause me to avoid people who have higher status than me to avoid upward comparison. In reading LW and rationalist blogs, I think I've turned away from useful material that takes longer for me to grasp because it makes me feel inferior. I sometimes binge on low-quality material, sometimes even seeking out highly downvoted posts; I suspect I do this because it allows me to mentally jeer at people or ideas I know are incorrect. More commonly, I'll seek out material that is already familiar to me. Worse, it's possible that all this reading has confirmed beliefs I was already predisposed to, and therefore been net-negative.</p>
<p>As a concrete example, Nate Soares has a post on the ""dubious virtue"" of <a href=""http://mindingourway.com/desperation/"">desperation</a>. It's dubious because it must be applied carefully: one must be desperate enough to go all-out in pursuit of a goal, but not burn out or signal visible desperation towards people.</p>
<p>I am already strong at the positive aspects of desperation, but the idea of ""dubious virtues"" is appealing to me (maybe it's the idea that I can outdo others by mastering a powerful technique often considered too dangerous). I read the article several times, largely disregarding the warnings because they made me feel uncomfortable, with the result that I burned out and signaled desperation towards people.</p>
<p>Something similar but more severe happened in 2013-14, when I fell into the following pattern (not quite literally true): A friend links me <a href=""http://yudkowsky.net/rational/virtues/"">a LW article</a>. Then my defense mechanisms of <a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/06/03/repost-epistemic-learned-helplessness/"">epistemic learned helplessness</a> activate and I stop reading. <em>(didn't they make the basilisk thing? I should read all about that so I can identify suspect arguments)</em> Then I decide I should prove my defense mechanisms <em>wrong</em> by reading a quarter of HPMOR in one night and memorizing the Rationalist Virtues! Then I completely stop reading out of fear that rationality is a cult/mind-hacking attempt. I decide to wait several years to dampen the cycle before becoming a rationalist. It's possible I spent six years in the rationalist uncanny valley and I'm not sure there was a simple way out before approximately last year.</p>
<h2>2a. Predictions and being a Straw Vulcan</h2>
<p>Others have gone through a phase of <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/hSMCZ9srzXuntA887/hammertime-intermission-and-open-thread?commentId=jD4guPvAwrWM3WjZi"">making all decisions by System 2 because they no longer trust System 1</a>. I'm somewhat related. Over the last few months, I've worked on making <a href=""https://80000hours.org/calibration-training/"">calibrated</a> predictions, including predicting my own future to inform career planning decisions. Perhaps due to the way I approach this exercise, I feel much less in touch with my emotions, and all predictions feel fuzzier. (It's also possible that my emotions are just unstable or suppressed due to the circumstances.) My feelings about the world vary with my mood, but now I try to correct for this and feel uncertain enough that I defer to a reference class or other people. Since I don't get to actually check on my own feelings, this is bad for practice.</p>
<h2>2b. Predictions reify pessimism</h2>
<p>Calibrating myself might be a good thing to do in ordinary times, but isolation has made me mildly depressed, causing reduced willpower. Consider a commitment I made recently to study with an peer over Zoom. In ordinary times, there's a 90% chance I keep this commitment. Taking into account my reduced agency, I predict an 80% chance I would do something that I normally do at 90%. However, there's a 65% chance that I actually do something I predict at 80%, so I continue until the fixed point, which is about 25%, which turns out to be accurate. Sometimes this fixed point is 0%.</p>
<p>In the past, I would mentally commit to actions I think I want to take (e.g. meditate regularly) then not actually follow through. Since I have realized how often this happens, I now make very few commitments. This has technically made me much more trustworthy, but the number of commitments I keep (to myself and others) has decreased in absolute terms.</p>
<h2>3. Not <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/HxXb8ogQSLDwnL7xh/notes-on-actually-trying"">Actually Trying</a></h2>
<p>Reading feels <em>much</em> better than trying, especially when it requires willpower and time and the outcome is uncertain.</p>
<ul>
<li>I've read most of the <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xhQxJ7WSZZRkzNZJ8/training-regime-day-1-what-is-applied-rationality"">Training Regime</a> sequence, but don't actually apply it to my life</li>
<li>A friend pointed me to <a href=""https://www.cnvc.org/node/6856"">Nonviolent Communication</a>, which I have not practiced.</li>
<li>Several interventions that could plausibly increase my everyday discipline, e.g.  <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/duxy4Hby5qMsv42i8/the-real-rules-have-no-exceptions"">The Real Rules Have No Exceptions</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I think this was out of reach in 2014 even if I had developed enough trust in LW to self-modify based on LW1 principles-- EY <a href=""https://www.readthesequences.com/"">notes</a> that the biggest mistake with the original Sequences was neglecting applications and practice opportunities.</p>
<h2>4. Disorientation and miscellaneous disruptions</h2>
<p>Anna Salamon says that a <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/byewoxJiAfwE6zpep/reality-revealing-and-reality-masking-puzzles"">particular type of disorientation</a> can result when a new rationalist discards common sense, and manifests as an inability to do the ""ordinary"" thing when it is correct. After LW discovered that the efficient market hypothesis <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ztct6FKw58KsCGf9C/refactoring-emh-thoughts-following-the-latest-market-crash"">is sometimes false</a> relative to strong predictors, I updated strongly towards rationalist exceptionalism in general, which may be correct, but this also increased my disorientation. Some examples I can identify:</p>
<ul>
<li>I tried to convince my friend who's a good fit for climate policy to shift to AI policy.</li>
<li>I noticed that I sometimes need to rationalize my curiosity about the world as something useful.</li>
<li><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/hSMCZ9srzXuntA887/hammertime-intermission-and-open-thread?commentId=jD4guPvAwrWM3WjZi"">Rationalists beginning to see non-rationalists as normies, NPCs, or otherwise sub-human</a>: I now find talking to non-rationalists much less interesting.</li>
<li>I often sink into a debate mindset that <em>any proposition</em> can be true if I make the right argument for it, which I previously only liked to enter while playing devil's-advocate. When arguing for a point, it's slightly more common for me to be unsure whether I actually believe it than before. I have no idea what's going on here since I'm not much better at rhetoric than before. Is my unconscious rebelling against efforts to stop motivated reasoning? Am I trying to <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/hSMCZ9srzXuntA887/hammertime-intermission-and-open-thread?commentId=jD4guPvAwrWM3WjZi"">play status games</a>? Should I have resolved my unwillingness to apologize?</li>
<li>Several counterproductive, intrusive thoughts that haven't gone away for several months of discussions with friends and occasional therapy:
<ul>
<li>My self-worth is derived from my absolute impact on the world-- sometimes causes a vicious cycle where I feel worthless, make plans that take that into account, and feel more worthless.</li>
<li>I'm a bad person if I'm a dedicated EA but don't viscerally feel the impact I have.</li>
<li>I'm a bad person if I eat meat (despite that vegetarianism is infeasible in the short term due to circumstances, and is a long-term goal for me)</li>
<li>After thinking about morality for a while, I'm 35% nihilist. This is supposed to not have an effect on my actions-- nihilism can just be subtracted out-- but everything feels approximately 35% hollow.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>While I derived benefits from the content, I think it's plausible that COVID-19 was otherwise a bad time to dive headfirst into rationality. If I am to make guidelines for people <strong>exactly like me</strong>, they would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Engage with material that interests you, but recognize discomfort and unhealthy reading patterns.</li>
<li>Consume material when you can actually practice it (e.g. mentally stable, some minimum amount of <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yLLkWMDbC9ZNKbjDG/slack"">slack</a>).</li>
<li>Practice it (still have to figure out how).</li>
</ul>

They want to go out and prevent those big fires which eat into their profits. Whenever there&#x2019;s a big fire, they find some way to prevent that sort of fire in the future. Now, different sizes of fire tend to result from different kinds of problems; preventing the once-a-year fires doesn&#x2019;t really stop the once-a-decade or once-a-century fires. But within a few years, the stream of roughly-once-a-year $5M claims has all but disappeared. Within a few decades, the stream of roughly-once-a-decade $25M claims has all but disappeared.</p><p>Iterative improvement - fixing problems as they come up - has eliminated 95% of the fires. Now what&#x2019;s the expected profit of this company in a random month?</p><p>Correct answer: still negative infinity. The black swans were always the problem, and they haven&#x2019;t been handled at all. If anything, the problem is worse, because now the company has eliminated most of the &#x201C;warning bells&#x201D; - the more-frequent fires which are big but not disastrous.</p><p>Moral of the story: when the value is in the long tail, iterative improvement - i.e. fixing problems as they come up - cannot unlock the bulk of the value. <strong>Long tails cannot be handled by iterative feedback and improvement.</strong></p><h2>What this really looks like</h2><p>The fire insurance example seems a bit unrealistic. In the real world, things like bankruptcy laws and government responses to extreme disasters would kick in, and our fire insurance company wouldn&#x2019;t actually have a valuation of negative infinity dollars.</p><p>Nonetheless, I do think the basic idea holds up: long tails cannot be handled by iterative improvement. A fire insurance company might dodge that problem by passing responsibility for the longest of the tail to the government, but there are plenty of value-in-the-tail scenarios where that won&#x2019;t work.</p><p><u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Nbcs5Fe2cxQuzje4K/value-of-the-long-tail"">Value of the Long Tail</a></u> opens with the example of a self-driving car project. If the car is safe 99% of the time - i.e. a human driver only needs to intervene to prevent an accident on one trip in a hundred - then this car will generate very little of the value of a full self-driving car.</p><p>What happens when we apply iterative improvement to this sort of project? We drive the car around a bunch, and every time a problem comes up, we fix it. Soon we&#x2019;ve picked the low-hanging fruit, and the remaining problems are all fairly complicated; failures arise from interactions between half a dozen subsystems. If we have 100 subsystems, and any given six can interact in novel ways to generate problems, then that&#x2019;s 100^6 = 1 trillion qualitatively distinct places where problems can occur. If 30% of our problems look like this, then we can spend millions of man-hours iteratively fixing problems as they come up and never even make a dent - and that&#x2019;s not even counting how much time the cars must be driven around to discover each problem!</p><p>The real world is high-dimensional. Rare problems are an issue in practice largely because high-dimensional spaces have exponentially many corners, and therefore exponentially many corner-cases. Each individual problem is rare and qualitatively different from other problems - patching one won&#x2019;t fix the others. That means iterative feedback and improvement won&#x2019;t ever push the rate of failures close to zero.</p>",johnswentworth,johnswentworth,johnswentworth,

It is appropriate, I think, since the historical and anthropological review that takes up the bulk of the book starts with an epic poem, the <em>Iliad</em>. This post will look for consciousness and subjectivity in another book and another poem. One that suggests a different view of the consciousness of our ancestors.</p><p>Jaynes&#x2019; theory is that up until the end of the second millennium B.C., humans did not have a subjective mental space where they could observe their own thoughts. Instead, they did most things on habitual autopilot (as you would drive a familiar road while completely zoned out). When faced with a novel situation, the information was processed by their right hemisphere and relayed to the left as the hallucinated voice of authority figures: living and dead ancestors, personal and tribal gods. These voices were immediately obeyed, resulting in appropriate action.</p><p>This thesis is supported by a wealth of evidence from archaeology (the hierarchical structure of ancient cities and proliferation of idols), anthropology (the widespread custom of burying corpses with a supply of fresh food), and recorded history (the complete submission of the Inca Empire upon the capture of its king Atahualpa by Pizarro). Of course, it is hard to know how cherry-picked is the evidence presented in the book. History has left us myriad hints, all of which could be interpreted in different ways.</p><span><figure><img src=""https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/louvre_code_hammurabi_bas_relief_rwk.jpg?w=900"" class=""draft-image "" style=""width:66%""></figure><em>The god Marduk (seated) dictating law to Hammurabi&#x2019;s right brain hemisphere</em></span><p> <em>The god Marduk (seated) dictating law to Hammurabi&#x2019;s right brain hemisphere</em> </p><p>Finally, Jaynes traces the breakdown of the bicameral mentality and the dawn of consciousness in the literature of Ancient Greece and in the Old Testament.</p><p>Jaynes claims:</p><blockquote>[The Old Testament], this magnificent collection of history and harangue, of song, sermon, and story is in its grand overall contour the description of the loss of the bicameral mind, and its replacement by subjectivity over the first millennium B.C.</blockquote><p>Unlike the idols of Sumer or the cuneiform of Egypt, the Old Testament I am deeply familiar with and can read in the original Hebrew. Biblical exegesis has been a hobby of my tribe for two millennia and I shall indulge in it too, all in the search for subjective consciousness.</p><h2>In The Beginning</h2><p>While the majority of the Old Testament was compiled from works written between the 8th and 2nd centuries B.C., it clearly contains echoes of much older myths. If we are to see traces of bicameral mentality in it, we&#x2019;d expect it to be in the beginning.</p><p>In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. Soon after, he created man. <u><a href=""https://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0103.htm"">Genesis 3:9-12</a></u> describes the first-ever conversation between God and man.</p><blockquote><strong>9</strong> And the LORD God called unto the man, and said unto him: &#x2018;Where art thou?&#x2019;<br><strong>10</strong> And he said: &#x2018;I heard Thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.&#x2019;<br><strong>11</strong>&#xA0;And He said: &#x2018;Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?&#x2019;<br><strong>12</strong>&#xA0;And the man said: &#x2018;The woman whom Thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.&#x2019;</blockquote><p>In Jaynes&#x2019; thesis, Achilles and Agamemnon are&#xA0;<em>&#x201C;obedient to their gods&#x201D;&#xA0;</em>and&#xA0;<em>&#x201C;did not have any ego whatever&#x201D;</em>. It is unimaginable that Athena would ask Achilles where he is &#x2014; she is inside his head!</p><p>In contrast, the first man in the Hebrew story begins his relationship with his god by hiding from him, bullshitting him, and making petty excuses. From the very beginning, God is external to man and man shows nothing like the automatic obedience Jaynes expected early humans to show not just to gods but to priests and viziers.</p><span><figure><img src=""https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/cain-and-god.png?w=900"" class=""draft-image default"" style=""width:79%""></figure><em>I ain&#x2019;t my brother&#x2019;s keeper, buddy, leave me alone.</em></span><p> <em>I ain&#x2019;t my brother&#x2019;s keeper, buddy, leave me alone.</em> </p><h2>Abraham&#x2019;s Voices</h2><p>If there&#x2019;s an obvious paragon of bicameral obedience in the Bible it&#x2019;s Abraham. <u><a href=""https://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0112.htm"">God&#x2019;s first words</a></u> to the patriarch are a command:&#xA0;<em>leave your house and go</em>. Abraham doesn&#x2019;t even reply; he goes. Later in life, Abraham is willing to sacrifice his own son at God&#x2019;s command. Although <u><a href=""https://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0122.htm"">careful readers will note</a></u> that this time Abraham answers God first, and waits until the next morning to obey.</p><p>But Abraham is no unconscious automaton. The first thing he does after fulfilling that first command is to journey down to Egypt for food (Genesis 12:10), and the first thing he does in Egypt is lie to Pharaoh about Sarai being his sister rather than wife so that the horny ruler of Egypt may treat them both with generosity. Pharaoh eventually catches on and kicks them out, deception was not unimaginable to him either.</p><p>Jaynes singles out intentional deceit as the clear mark of subjective consciousness. He traces the transition to consciousness in Greek lore from the Iliad&#x2019;s men of action (the wooden horse is not part of that poem) to the <u><a href=""https://putanumonit.com/2019/06/25/playstation-odysseys/"">many-faced hero of the&#xA0;</a></u><em><u><a href=""https://putanumonit.com/2019/06/25/playstation-odysseys/"">Odyssey</a></u>.</em></p><span><figure><img src=""https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/we-are-men-of-action-lies-do-not-become-us-53737345.png"" class=""draft-image default"" style=""width:75%""></figure></span><p>But in the Hebrew Bible, Abraham goes immediately from direct obedience to premeditated trickery. The old man could have been schizotypal, but he had no problem with theory-of-mind.</p><p>In fact, Abraham is not averse to bargaining with God as well. In <u><a href=""https://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0118.htm"">Genesis 18:20</a></u> God informs Abraham of his plan to smite Sodom and Gomorrah. Abraham replies: &#x201C;<em>Come on man,</em> <em>wilt thou indeed sweep away the righteous with the wicked?&#x201D;</em> He then proceeds to painstakingly haggle with God about the minimum number of righteous people that would justify saving Sodom from destruction.</p><p>The overall impression one gets of Abraham is that of a diligent employee who reads well his boss&#x2019; mood, not of a mindless robot.</p><h2>Jacob&#x2019;s Game</h2><p>If Abraham dabbles in deceit and trickery, Jacob&#x2019;s life is fully embroiled in it. He starts off by <u><a href=""https://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0127.htm"">deceiving his naive father</a></u> to gain his blessing and ends up being lied to by his own sons about the fate of Joseph many decades later. Like Odysseus, Jacob embarks on a long journey to return home from the Far East in which he must rely on his wits as much as on his strength and faith.</p><p><u><a href=""https://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0129.htm"">My favorite story</a></u> of my namesake hero takes place by a well in Haran, which is in modern-day Iraq. I owe its interpretation to the wonderful Israeli writer Meir Shalev, <u><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/879238._"">from a book that unfortunately</a></u> hasn&#x2019;t yet been translated from Hebrew.</p><p>The well in Haran is covered by a rock too heavy to be lifted by a single man. The local shepherds slowly gather by the well, waiting until all are assembled to lift the rock and water their flocks together. Jacob is relieved to hear that they know Laban, his maternal uncle whom he journeyed 700 miles to find. The shepherds also point out that Laban&#x2019;s young daughter is approaching with her father&#x2019;s sheep. Jacob looks up and sees a girl so smoking hot that Genesis 29:17 describes her looks in duplicate:</p><blockquote>Rachel was of beautiful form and fair to look upon.</blockquote><p>Protocol dictates that Jacob should introduce himself to the beautiful shepherdess as her first cousin come to seek refuge with her father. But the young man does nothing of the sort.</p><blockquote><strong>10</strong>&#xA0;And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother&#x2019;s brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother&#x2019;s brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well&#x2019;s mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother&#x2019;s brother.<br><strong>11</strong>&#xA0;And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.<br><strong>12</strong>&#xA0;And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father&#x2019;s brother, and that he was Rebekah&#x2019;s son; and she ran and told her father.</blockquote><p>This passage is pure <u><a href=""https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Game"">game</a></u>.</p><p>Rachel approaches the well and sees among the usual weary crowd a new man, dirty from travel but also alluring and mysterious. Without saying a word the man shows incredible physical strength in lifting the massive rock, but before Rachel has time to get scared he shows his dedication and generosity by watering her entire flock himself. <em>I&#x2019;m a brute but I&#x2019;m&#xA0;<strong>your</strong></em> <em>devoted brute</em> is the plot of every romance novel, literally the oldest seduction trope in the book.</p><p>But Jacob isn&#x2019;t done. He seizes to moment to plant a hot kiss on Rachel&#x2019;s lips, an unthinkably bold thing to do with a stranger even in our more promiscuous age. And then, lest Rachel think that he&#x2019;s a psychopath, Jacob bursts into tears of emotion. It is only after this magnificent display of seduction, having put Rachel through a rom-com&#x2019;s worth of emotions in the span of minutes, that Jacob gets to the unpleasant part of admitting to Rachel that he is her cousin, broke and on the run.</p><span><figure><img src=""https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/jacob-rachel-people-of-bible.adapt_.1190.1.jpg?w=900"" class=""draft-image default"" style=""width:94%""></figure><em>Rachel and Jacob</em> <em>by William Dyce, the only painter who left the scene a modicum of its hotness</em></span><p>Shalev explains that his one kiss burned on Rachel&#x2019;s lips for seven years as she waited to marry the man who stole her heart by the well. Here I must disagree with the scholar. Genesis 29:20 is the most romantic line in the entire Bible, perhaps in any holy book:</p><blockquote>And Jacob worked seven years for Rachel; and they were to him as mere days, for his loving her.</blockquote><p>The last clause (&#x5D1;&#x5BC;&#x5B0;&#x5D0;&#x5B7;&#x5D4;&#x5B2;&#x5D1;&#x5B8;&#x5EA;&#x5D5;&#x5B9; &#x5D0;&#x5B9;&#x5EA;&#x5B8;&#x5D4;&#x5BC;) is ambiguous in Hebrew. The translation above is my attempt to preserve the ambiguity. Shalev explains this verse in the most romantic way possible: Jacob&#x2019;s love inspired and sustained him for those seven years (and then seven more, as he was tricked by Rachel&#x2019;s father into marrying her sister first).</p><p>But those familiar with unconsummated desire know that it tends to make seconds stretch into hours, not to compress years into days. My read is the years flying by for Jacob because he is loving Rachel in a very physical sense throughout that time, not just in his fantasy. Jacob finds employment in Laban&#x2019;s household as a goatherd, and surely two young people in love grazing their herds far from the main house can find some private hours to spend together. After their marriage, it turns out that Rachel is infertile, an unpleasant fact that nevertheless must have prevented a good deal of awkwardness in those early years. Or perhaps she just forgot to remove her IUD.</p><p>By the end of his profitable employment with Laban, Jacob fathers twelve children by four women. <u><a href=""https://putanumonit.com/2017/05/12/dark-fiction/"">It is perhaps little coincidence</a></u> that I am a <u><a href=""https://putanumonit.com/2018/02/08/antiantinatalism/"">pronatalist</a></u> <u><a href=""https://putanumonit.com/2019/10/16/polyamory-is-rational/"">polyamorist</a></u>, given that the Old Testament hero whose name I bear is such an inspiration. Shalev and generations of rabbis would have us believe that a man as virile as Jacob kept it in his pants for fourteen years around a beautiful woman who fell in love with him at first kiss. I find that preposterous.</p><p>If you read the Old Testament in the original, it is chock full of sex, seduction, lust, prostitution, and pervasive horniness in general. It is not particularly judgmental of these things either, as long as they occur between a man and a non-menstruating woman (the Bible gets <em>really</em> weird around menstruation).</p><p>Sodom&#x2019;s sin is not sodomy (it&#x2019;s breach of hospitality), and Onan&#x2019;s sin is not onanism (it&#x2019;s cheating his sister-in-law of her inheritance by refusing to get her pregnant). David and Solomon, which the Bible goes to great lengths to portray as positively as possible, were notorious ladies&#x2019; men. The former had two different men killed (!) so that he could marry their sexy wives. The latter famously had 700 wives and 300 concubines (!!), and also wrote <u><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song_of_Songs"">erotic poetry spicy enough</a></u> to be included in the Old Testament even though it talks not about God or the people of Israel, but about <u><a href=""https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=song+of+songs+4%3A5&amp;version=NIV"">boobs</a></u> (!!!)</p><span><figure><img src=""https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/two-fawns.jpg?w=900"" class=""draft-image default"" style=""width:72%""></figure><em>Perky!</em></span><p>As you can guess, this all caused great consternation for the Hebrew sages through the centuries who contorted themselves, the text, and logic itself into twisted pretzels so as not to admit that the Old Testament looks favorably on fucking. Christians often just elided the sexy parts in their many mistranslations of the Old Testament into European languages and used the book as justification for endless prudish inhibitions. Denying the sexiness in the Old Testament is the real perversion.</p><h2>Seductive Subjectivity</h2><p>Why this long digression into the salacious? Sex is entertaining, but it&#x2019;s also key to understanding consciousness.</p><p>Geoffrey Miller lays out the case in&#xA0;<em><u><a href=""https://www.primalpoly.com/the-mating-mind"">The Mating Mind</a></u></em> that human creative intelligence, art, morality, and storytelling, all evolved under the pressure of sexual selection. This evolution started around 2 million years ago when <u><a href=""https://twitter.com/yashkaf/status/1251630196861612040"">hominid brain sizes began a rapid explosion</a></u> that is impossible to explain by looking at the non-human environment. Foraging for berries or hiding from a predator require neither advanced intellect nor subjective consciousness. Seducing a partner with a love poem requires both.</p><span><figure><img src=""https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/human-evolution-brain-size.gif"" class=""draft-image default"" style=""width:100%""></figure></span><p>Miller tells the sexual selection story of the evolution of consciousness <u><a href=""https://www.primalpoly.com/s/2000-mating-mind-consciousness-chapter.docx"">in a bonus chapter that you can read for free</a></u>. He starts by pointing out that the p-zombie thought experiment applies mostly to abstract strangers; no one thinks it remotely plausible that their beloved spouse of many years could lack subjectivity.</p><p>There&#x2019;s also&#xA0;<em>reportability</em>: the parts of our minds that we have conscious access to and can describe are precisely those that are important for sexual partners (along with close friends and allies) to examine. You do not immediately know by introspection how your brain directs your heart or throws a rock, but your pulse and the rock&#x2019;s trajectory can be easily seen from the outside. It is precisely the redness of a rose, whether you can recognize it, process it in consciousness, and compare it to your lover&#x2019;s lips, that this lover wants to hear about.</p><p>Physicality is important too, and our sexual organs along with other physically attractive characteristics have also evolved by sexual selection. But girls like the quarterback not just because he&#x2019;s athletic but also because quarterback play requires intellect, discipline, and leadership. Anna Khachiyan, <u><a href=""https://twitter.com/annakhachiyan/status/1199468989736468481"">who looks like this</a></u>, has expressed multiple times her sexual attraction to Slavoj &#x17D;i&#x17E;ek, <u><a href=""https://spectator.us/like-about-coronavirus-slavoj-zizek/"">who looks like this</a></u>, and she wasn&#x2019;t being facetious (at least, not more than usual).</p><p>Seducing a mental peer has been the greatest and most interesting challenge for most humans for a hundred thousand years at least. Because of the pressure of evolution, it&#x2019;s a challenge that pushes us to the very edge of our capacity for thought and consciousness. As Miller points out, algorithms that are surpassing humans in many mental tasks and forms of imitation are still quite hopeless at seduction. Seduction requires demonstrating consciousness and assessing it in others, and consciousness may have evolved in large part for the purpose of seduction.</p><p>Jacob&#x2019;s successful enticement of Rachel by the well, a novel situation that he could not have prepared for or learned by imitation, demonstrates not only advanced consciousness but also his ability to anticipate and manipulate the consciousness of a woman.</p><p><u><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Jaynes"">From what I can tell</a></u>, Julian James never married and had no children. Google failed to turn up any romantic history associated with the writer.</p><h2>Deborah&#x2019;s Song</h2><p>The story of Deborah, recounted in Judges 4 and again in song form in <u><a href=""https://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0705.htm"">Judges 5</a></u>, tells of a military victory by the Israelites over Sisera, a Canaanite warlord. The events described occurred around 12th century B.C., and the poem was written down not long afterward. This makes the Song of Deborah a contemporary of the Iliad on both counts. Its subject matter of gods and war is also similar.</p><p>The two poems also contain an exhortation to sing. The Iliad calls on a muse:&#xA0;<em>Sing, goddess, of the rage of Achilles</em>. Jaynes sees this as further evidence that all action in Ancient Greece was attributable to gods, from the waging of the war to the singing of the poem. The bard itself was just a vessel for the goddess&#x2019; song.</p><p>In contrast, Deborah addresses herself: <em>Awake, awake, Deborah; Awake, awake, utter a song.</em> While the poem at least pays lip service in crediting God with the Israelite victory, the song is her own. God is the audience, not the originator: <em>Hear, o kings, give ear, o princes: unto the Lord I will sing, I will sing praise to the Lord, God of Israel.</em></p><span><figure><img src=""https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/12_tribes_of_israel_map.png"" class=""draft-image default"" style=""width:67%""></figure></span><p>The plot, in brief: the Canaanite king Jabin is occupying the city of Hazor and oppressing the northern tribes through his warlord, Sisera, and his 900 iron chariots. Barak, a military leader of the Naphtali tribe, travels south to the Judean hills to consult with Deborah, a prophetess and civil leader (judge). She tells him to assemble 10,000 men on Mount Tabor, and when Sisera shows up God confounds his cavalry and they are routed by the Israelites. Sisera escapes and seeks shelter in the tent of Jael, but when he falls asleep she drives a stake through his head and shows his corpse to Barak.</p><p>This general outline could be a story of either a bicameral people or a fully conscious one. But when we dig into the details, there will be no doubt of the consciousness of the story&#x2019;s participants.</p><p>Jaynes&#x2019; vision of the ancient world is one of life in tight, hierarchical cities, each man hallucinating the voices of his ancestors and gods. Every nook and cranny was filled with statues and idols, to aid with triggering the hallucinations. Coordination across large distances is possible only through a particularly strong emperor like Hammurabi whose likeness is engraved everywhere to prompt the hallucination of his commands in the minds of his subjects.</p><p>Jaynes doesn&#x2019;t claim that the Old Testament describes a bicameral society, but one that is recovering from the trauma of the breakdown of bicamerality and the departure of the divine voices. This breakdown was occasioned by clashes of civilizations and mass migrations of refugees, bringing people whose voices gave conflicting commands to close proximity and giving rise to situations too novel and stressful to deal with adequately by waiting for a hallucination.</p><p>Israel, as described in the book of Judges, could not be more different from that. The twelve tribes of Israel occupy a large area but lack a central capital or even major cities. The entire book deals with the transition from nomadic life to a built-up and centralized nation, not vice versa. The people live in scattered households, bound together by language, tradition, and religion, in the complete absence of any idols or imagery since those are expressly prohibited in the commandments. The Israelites regularly interact with dozens of other peoples, some in war and some in trade and friendship. In fact, the third main character of Deborah&#x2019;s song is Jael the <u><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenite"">Kenite</a></u>, a nomadic tribe that lived in proximity to the Israelites for centuries.</p><p>The vast majority of characters in the Bible don&#x2019;t hear the voice of God and don&#x2019;t expect to, and if they do they are freaked out more than they are relieved. For religious matters, everyone prefers to consult the priests and prophets. Jaynes claims that &#x201C;prophet&#x201D; is a mistranslation of the Hebrew word &#x201C;navi&#x201D;, and that after the breakdown of bicamerality that word referred to half-conscious half-bicameral schizophrenics who entered hallucinatory trances through song and dance.</p><p>Deborah, described as <em>isha neviah (</em>a prophetess woman), would lol at that theory very hard.</p><span><figure><img src=""https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/deborah-gettyimages-173449598-57068a385f9b581408ce21b8.jpg?w=900"" class=""draft-image default"" style=""width:100%""></figure><em>Deborah judging Israel</em></span><p>Although her song is evidence of an affinity to music, Deborah is not a vagabond witch but a respected married woman. She has her own dwelling not far from the important religious center of Bet El and <em>&#x2018;the children of Israel came up to her for judgment</em>&#x2018; &#x2014; she is an arbiter and mediator of disputes for a people with no king.</p><p>When Barak comes to her for advice, she doesn&#x2019;t just tell him to trust in the Lord but offers a pragmatic war plan. Barak is able to gather 10,000 men with the aid of Deborah&#x2019;s reputation and the threat of her judgment &#x2014; indeed in her song she mocks those tribes who hid among their flocks of sheep instead of offering military aid.</p><p>The forces of Naphtali and Zebulun gather at Mount Tabor. Why that location? Most of Israel is flat, dry, or both, but Tabor is steep, forested, and at the foot of it is a muddy creek. When Sisera&#x2019;s heavy chariots show up they are neutralized by the rugged terrain, and his forces are overwhelmed by the unexpectedly large number of Barak&#x2019;s warriors. Credit God all you want, but this was a sound infantry ambush of a better-equipped force that would make Hannibal proud <u><a href=""https://www.britannica.com/topic/Battle-of-Trasimene"">1,000 years later at Trasimene</a></u>.</p><p>Sisera escapes and shows up at the tent of Jael, whose tribe is neutral in the conflict, asking for water and a place to hide from Barak. For Jael, this is the sort of novel life-or-death situation that the Greek heroes battling 600 miles away can&#x2019;t navigate without their gods. But the humble Kenite woman thinks fast on her feet and doesn&#x2019;t need permission from gods or husbands to make a decision. Realizing that Sisera&#x2019;s desperate situation augurs an impending change of regime, Jael lulls him to sleep with milk and a warm blanket and then brutally murders him. When Barak shows up, hot on Sisera&#x2019;s heels, he can only express his admiration.</p><p>But the most striking evidence of modern conscious psychology is not in Deborah&#x2019;s clever planning or in Jael&#x2019;s quick thinking, but in the trash talk. After graphically describing Sisera&#x2019;s bloody murder in song, Deborah suddenly introduces a new character &#x2014; his mother.</p><blockquote><strong>28</strong> &#x201C;Through the window&#xA0;peered Sisera&#x2019;s mother;<br>behind the lattice she cried out,<br>&#x2018;Why is his chariot so long in coming?<br>Why is the clatter of his chariots delayed?&#x2019;<br><strong>29</strong> The wisest of her ladies answer her;<br>indeed, she keeps saying to herself,<br><strong>30</strong> &#x2018;Are they not finding and dividing the spoils:<br>a woman or two for each man,<br>colorful garments as plunder for Sisera,<br>colorful garments embroidered,<br>highly embroidered garments&#xA0;for my neck&#x2014;<br>all this as plunder?&#x2019;</blockquote><p>Deborah imagines the mother of the Canaanite warlord awaiting his return, and mocks her viciously by talking about her psychology. According to <u><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%BCbler-Ross_model"">the five-stage model of grief</a></u> published 3,000 years after Deborah, the first stage is denial. And so Sisera&#x2019;s mother is in denial, ignoring her wisest ladies to imagine that his delay is due to the time it takes him to gather up the many spoils of battle. It becomes clear that Deborah didn&#x2019;t gain the tribes&#x2019; respect through any particular association with the divine but through pragmatic wisdom.</p><span><figure><img src=""https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/felice-ficherelli-jael-sisera.jpg?w=900"" class=""draft-image default"" style=""width:92%""></figure><em>Jael breaking down Sisera&#x2019;s bicameral brain once and for all.</em></span><p> <em>Jael breaking down Sisera&#x2019;s bicameral brain once and for all.</em> </p><h2>Ancient Greece, Modern Canaan</h2><p>What to make of this gap between the zombies of Troy and the subjectively conscious heroes of the Bible? Jaynes would say that the few centuries (at most) separating the two are exactly the period when consciousness emerged and bicameral mentality disappeared. But equally remarkable is the lack of a gap between the Old Testament and our own time, 2,500 years later.</p><p>Adam makes up excuses, Cain is sarcastic, Abraham bullshits, Jacob seduces, Jael calculates, and Deborah psychologizes. It&#x2019;s the characters&#x2019; conscious mentality, so easy for 21st-century readers to recognize and identify with, that makes the Old Testament an exciting and compelling read (<u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/bfbiyTogEKWEGP96S/fake-justification"">contra the haters</a></u>).</p><p>Jaynes&#x2019; theory posits two massive transformations, each happening in a blink on an evolutionary time scale. First, the emergence of bicameral mentality from animal darkness in a few short millennia around the Neolithic Revolution. Then, the complete disappearance of bicameralism and the emergence of subjective consciousness in a few short centuries around the fall of Troy.&#xA0; This makes it prima facie a lot less likely than Geoffrey Miller&#x2019;s view that human consciousness emerged along with everything else over the million years of brain growth and intellectual innovation in our species, a biological process and not a cultural shock.</p><p>It may seem strange to the reader that I would use the Old Testament to argue for evolutionary psychology, but it doesn&#x2019;t seem strange to me. My thought has been shaped by both. I feel a kinship with my ancestors who have read <em>the book</em> for two thousand years, and with the characters depicted in it. I think we share a consciousness.</p>",Jacobian,jacob-falkovich,Jacob Falkovich,

However, you are a human being. Human beings are <em>complicated.</em> Human beings have <em>complicated</em> life problems. Complicated life problems are both hard to think of and hard to solve.</p><p>Potted plants are simple. Potted plants have simple life problems. Simple life problems are easy to think of, although they still might be difficult to solve.</p><p>You are now a potted plant. This will help you think of major life problems by abstracting away complexity.</p><h1>Questions</h1><h2>Water</h2><p>One of the things that plants need is water. Naively, you&apos;re supposed to water your plants. However, if you water your plants too much, they suffer from being <em>overwatered</em>. (Maybe potted plants aren&apos;t so simple after all.)</p><p>Suppose that you-as-a-plant is receiving too much water. What is the water a metaphor for?</p><p>Are you spending too much time doing any particular activity? Consuming too much of a certain type of content? Thinking too much about a particular concept?</p><p>Sometimes, there&apos;s a problem that you think you can solve with <em>more</em> of something. Sometimes, this is <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/12/02/more-dakka/"">correct</a>. Sometimes, it is wrong. Sometimes, you should stop adding more and start adding less.</p><h2>Light</h2><p>Another thing plants need is light. Naively, you just put your plant next to a window. However, plants have <em>different sides</em>. If you don&apos;t rotate your plant, one side will grow faster than the other and it will become lopsided. (Maybe potted plants aren&apos;t so simple after all.)</p><p>Suppose that you-as-a-plant is receiving light in an uneven distribution. What is the light a metaphor for?</p><p>Are you getting too much of a resource from a particular person? Are you too dependent on a certain activity? Is there part of your routine that&apos;s <em>too </em><a href=""https://theunitofcaring.tumblr.com/post/174283682391/load-bearing"">load-bearing</a>? </p><p>Sometimes, there&apos;s something that you want, so you try to get a lot of it. Sometimes, you don&apos;t realize that there are <em>different forms</em> of that thing. Sometimes, optimizing for getting a lot of that thing means you only get the form that&apos;s easy to get. Sometimes, you need to drink something that&apos;s not soylent.</p><h2>Fruit</h2><p>A thing that plants produce is fruit. Naively, you allow your plant to produce fruit. However, plants have <em>finite resources</em>. If you allow your plant to produce fruit, it won&apos;t grow as much - nipping some of the flowers before they turn into fruit can let your plant grow stronger. (Maybe potted plants aren&apos;t so simple after all.)</p><p>Suppose that you-as-a-plant is producing too much fruit. What is the fruit a metaphor for?</p><p>(Sometimes, the problem happens in the opposite direction - you&apos;re growing too much and not producing enough fruit. Think about this case also.)</p><p>Are you spending too little time on <a href=""http://yudkowsky.net/rational/virtues/"">scholarship</a>? Are you trying too hard to get stronger? Do you have the right distribution of meta/object work?</p><p>Sometimes, you want something <em>so bad</em> that you just try and get it directly. Sometimes you need to grow up first. Sometimes, the most direct <em>path</em> doesn&apos;t involve direct <em>action</em>. </p><h2>Pot</h2><p>Another thing plants need is a pot. Naively, you just put your plant into a pot. However, plants <em>grow</em>. If you don&apos;t take your plant out of the pot, the roots will hit the sides - your plant will be confined by the pot. (Maybe potted plants aren&apos;t so simple after all.)</p><p>Suppose that you-as-a-plant is in too small of a pot. What is the pot a metaphor for?</p><p>Is your physical space too small for you? Are you in a relationship that is preventing you from growing? Is your culture supporting you or confining you? Would you even be able to tell if your pot was too small?</p><p>Sometimes, you need to grow out to grow up. Sometimes, you need to leave something safe in order to find something bigger. Sometimes, you need to improve, which means you need to change.</p><h2>Bugs</h2><p>A thing that hurts plants is bugs. Naively, you remove all bugs from your plants. However, there are <em>good bugs</em> and <em>bad bugs </em>(ladybugs and aphids, for example). If you remove the good bugs, then the bad bugs might hurt your plant. (Maybe potted plants aren&apos;t so simple after all.)</p><p>Suppose that you-as-a-plant has some good bugs. What could these bugs be?</p><p>Are some of your bugs justified defense mechanisms? Are you uncomfortable for a good reason? Do some of your bugs cancel each other out?</p><p>Sometimes, so-called &quot;irrationality&quot; makes your life better. Sometimes, you are about the enter the <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/aPEfdgzukPcJCui9D/my-experience-with-the-rationalist-uncanny-valley"">uncanny valley</a>. Sometimes, <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/AdYdLP2sRqPMoe8fb/knowing-about-biases-can-hurt-people "">knowing about biases can hurt people</a>. Sometimes, you should <em>wait</em> <em>until you are ready.</em></p><h2>Traveling</h2><p>Plants need many things, but humans have needs too. Sometimes, the human needs to go away for a while. Naively, you just ask your friend to take care of your plants. But plants are <em>complicated</em> - if you don&apos;t explain, you&apos;ll come back to an over-watered, lopsided plant with too much fruit in too small a pot and no good bugs. (Maybe plants aren&apos;t so simple after all.)</p><p>Suppose that you need to go away for a while and you need to ensure you-as-a-plant remains healthy. What is &quot;ensuring&quot; a metaphor for? (This scheme is breaking down slightly, but I think you get the point).</p><p>Are there processes that you need to personally oversee? Is your routine heavily depending on your current location? Are there people that depend heavily on your presence?</p><p>Sometimes, it feels good to be needed. Sometimes, putting out fires makes you feel important. Sometimes, this means that you don&apos;t implement systems to stop fires from starting. Sometimes, you need to make yourself not needed.</p><h1>Exercise</h1><p>Pretend to be a potted plant.</p>",mark-xu,mark-xu,Mark Xu,

I&apos;m not sure if linking it at the top is encouraged/allowed by LW policy, if it isn&apos;t, please let me know.</p><p>I&apos;ve read up (possibly superficially?) on many ethical systems or at  least viewpoints on ethics. But it seems that, once you reach the sphere  of actions I can actually undertake in my daily life, almost none of  the prescriptive claims given or derived from these systems differ.</p><p>For the sake of argument, let&apos;s take a system like the existentialist  ethics prescribed by de Beauvoir, an up to date version of Aristotelian  teleology based ethics, Kant&apos;s deontological ethics, Singer&apos;s branch of  value-of-life consequentialist ethics and some New England style  Christian ethics.</p><p>If you take an extreme thought experiments, the kind where you ask something like:</p><ul><li>What if I was a monarch with absolute power over the world ?</li><li>What if I had a god-like action potential over a life-and-death choice between two groups of agents ?</li></ul><p>Then you can argue ad-infinitum as to how the actions prescribed by  the systems of ethics differ and I do believe they might differ. But we  don&#x2019;t live in thought experiments.</p><p>Applying these systems to the kind of choices that I make in everyday  life I can see all of them basically saying something like:</p><p>&#x2022; Well, I should take better care of my body... exercise more, don&apos;t  drink coffee late at night, don&apos;t vape/smoke, eat healthy and in  moderation, don&apos;t be awake at 4AM browsing reddit (etc)</p><p>&#x2022; Be kinder to friends and family... spend more time thinking about  who might be lonely during the quarantine and give them a call, visit  more often.</p><p>&#x2022; Donate more to projects and organizations that help the world (e.g. Wikipedia) and volunteer more of my time to said entities.</p><p>&#x2022; I should try to be better at my work, research more, don&apos;t give up  on hard problems so soon, be nicer to my coworkers, spend less time  signaling about &quot;the work I do&quot; and more time &quot;doing it&quot;. Even more, I  should seek the kind of work that inspires me and that has a high  potential for bringing new discoveries in fields I care about.</p><p>&#x2022; I should avoid spurious hookups and seek a genuine and authentic  human connection in my relationships and be less afraid of expressing  interest and love in the people I like.</p><p>&#x2026; etc, I hope you get the point. To some extent, if you boil down  ethical systems to day to day actions you get the kind of boring  platitude one sees on motivational posters.</p><p>It seems that most of the choices I have that might lead me to  immoral actions are choices where I am fighting laziness and desire for  things that I know to be insubstantial and ultimately vain and useless.</p><h2>How to turn Hitler ethical</h2><p>There&apos;s probably not a single mc-job working weed-smoking couch  potato that thinks &quot;Oh man, this is the life, God help those poor doctors  helping people fend off the spread of parasites in Rowanda&quot;.</p><p>Most people that are in some way acting less ethically than they  could, seem to be doing so due to the inner-workings of their mind and  their present circumstance not giving them the power to do otherwise,  not due to lacking some sort of philosophical grounding by which they  can determine ethical value.</p><p>Even people who we would consider to be &#x201C;inherently evil&#x201D; would  probably act very differently with just minor tweaks to their lifestyle  and circumstances.</p><p>So, let&#x2019;s say you have 5-minutes to chat up young Hitler and turn him  into an ethical man&#x2026; not anything saintly, just turn him from  &#x201C;genocidal madman national-socialist leader&#x201D; to &#x201C;a mediocre painter that  makes antisemitic jokes and complains about lack of discipline in  society when he gets too drunk&#x201D;.</p><p>Well, even assuming we could get across the categorical imperative or  the idea of forms having inherent purpose this wouldn&#x2019;t necessarily  convince him to abandon his way. Utilitarian Hitler and Christian Hitler  will commit genocide just the same, Christian Hitler will use some  excuse motivated by religion symbolism and purity, Utilitarian Hitler  will use some excuse motivated by the greater good, Existentialist  Hitler will use a line about the Ubermensch&#x2026; but they will be excuses  just the same, they will be facades over the real problem which is a  deep-seated antisemitism born out of years of repressed resentment in  need of a scapegoat and a social environment that encourages and feeds  off that emotion.</p><p>So how do you stop that from happening ?</p><p>Well, I think a good bet would be telling young Hitler something like:</p><p>Hey man, I saw that painting of yours and it&#x2019;s quite nice, but you  need to get a bit more creative, start putting some style into it&#x2026; even  if it feels &#x201C;clich&#xE9;&#x201D; or &#x201C;fake&#x201D; to be with. Also, fuck university  professors, they don&#x2019;t know how to tell good from bad art more than any  other man, keep at it, if one university rejects you, apply to 10 more,  if all 10 reject you, go showcase your craft in the streets of Vienna.</p><p>&#x2026; Or something like that.</p><p>The point here is that the problem with Hitler and most other  horrible people doesn&#x2019;t stem from their ethics, barring people like  Tem&#xFC;jin Borjigin, most genocidal monsters had a pretty well-developed  system of ethics. The popes could write a book about why the Crusades  were right and moral. The 9/11 terrorists could write a book about why  their actions were ethical. The nazi leaders or the CCP ministers could  (and did) write whole books from diverse angles and systems of ethics  about why murder dozens of millions of people in sadistic ways was the  most ethical thing to do.</p><p>The problem stems from the factors that build up anger, resentment,  misinformation and lack of alternatives that lead one to take the  unethical actions to being with.</p><h2>Willpower</h2><p>Going even further, one could argue there&apos;s not enough willpower to  do all the things which would lead to a more ethical life, but in that  case, I fail to see any way of &quot;ranking&quot; the things I could focus on as  stemming from a system of ethics.</p><p>Let&apos;s say I wanted to rank between day to day actions that will &quot;help  me become a better moral agent&quot;. Say I&apos;m choosing between exercising,  doing research in a field I like, volunteering at a homeless shelter and  writing code for open source projects I think are useful.</p><p>I go to de Beauvoir with that question I&apos;d get an answer like: &quot;Well,  we are all free to pursue our authentic self, so considering all those  actions seem like good things, choose whichever you feel like you really  want, try to look past social prescriptions and think what would 20  years older you think&quot;</p><p>I go to Aristotle and I get something like: &quot;Well, all those actions  seem like good undertakings but at the end of the day every man&apos;s  purpose in the world is different, do whatever action suits you best  based on the kind of man you want to be, whatever you know deep inside  to be suited to your telos&quot;</p><p>I go to Bentham with the question and I get something like: &quot;Well,  all those actions could lead to some utility for you and others, I guess  the choice is up to you to do that calculus and figure out which will  work best in the long run and if there&apos;s no clear winner, just do  whatever would make you happiest right now, after all, maximizing  utility applies to you in the moment as well&quot;</p><p>I got to Jesus with that question and I get something like: &#x201C;Well, I  guess the bible says love thy neighbor, but really, it was written like  1800 years ago and back then the scientific method and computers weren&#x2019;t  a thing, so in a way those contributions are also indirect ways of  helping your fellow humans, so, ahem, yeah, whatever dude, all of those  seem fine as long as you remember to prioritize your daily prayer to  daddy&#x201D;.</p><p>I go to Kant with that question and I get something like: &quot;Well, no  matter what choice you make, if all men were to make that choice the  world would surely be a better place, I see nothing here that violates  my categorical imperative, so I guess just do whatever you like best. If  all people were to select to pursue virtuous things which they enjoy  that would lead to a better world, so you should pursue the virtuous  thing which you like best&quot;</p><p>... etc, hopefully, you get my point.</p><p>There are countless actions that we do every moment which would be  considered &quot;ethical&quot; since they put us closer to a position from which  we can better pursue and act rightfully in those few &quot;important&quot; cases.</p><p>But as far as the countless everyday actions which end up deciding  our overall behavior the problem really boils down to willpower and our  choice in distributing said willpower.</p><p>It seems that, maybe, the one thing a system of ethics could do is  tell people how to best spend their limited willpower, but even there it  seems that most systems of ethics would come up short since they to  some extent rely on knowing the consequences of an action (even in the  case of a normative system, since the kind of everyday actions we take  usually lack normative value unless you aggregate them over a long  period... at which point you are looking at their consequences).</p><p>So from that perspective, wouldn&apos;t the study of ethics boil down to  something that&apos;s in itself ethically neutral or even unethical. In that,  it would only lead to more rationalizing of our natural drives to take  the easy route and procrastinate as &quot;indecision paralysis&quot; or &quot;pondering  between choices&quot; when in 99.999% of cases we know what the &quot;correct&quot;  action would be, we just lack the willpower to make it consistently.</p><h2>In Conclusion</h2><ol><li>Most actions lack direct ethical value, but taking them does  amount to something of ethical value, however, this might not be  obvious. Even when it is obvious, taking the actions that lead to good  outcomes is usually inherently difficult. Ethical systems hold no  obvious solution for figuring out how actions add up over time, or for  overcoming mental barriers to provide us with more willpower.<br> </li><li>The day to day actions that do have some ethical value associated  with them, don&#x2019;t differ in terms of direction between any given ethical  system (e.g.. no matter how you splice it, kicking a puppy is unethical  and helping an old lady cross the street is ethical). If they do differ  in magnitude (e.g. if it is quantifiably better to help an old lady  cross the street than to help an old lady reach the top shelf), I fail  to see a way of ranking actions as being provided by most popular  systems of ethics.<br> </li><li>There are easy ways to being a better moral agent, but to do  that, you should probably maximize the time you spend taking care of  yourself, taking care of others, volunteering, or working towards  important issues&#x2026; rather than reading Kant.<br> </li></ol><p>Thus I&#x2019;ve come to think of ethic partially as a sort of &#x201C;memetic  tap&#x201D;, it intuitively seems that reading about ethics will help you act  more ethically, but the more I&#x2019;ve read about ethics, the more I&#x2019;ve  realized is just a form of procrastination that conveniently enough can  rationalize as &#x201C;doing something morally good&#x201D;.</p>",George3d6,george3d6,George3d6,

In the Zoo Hypothesis, humans solve human problems, and Contact occurs when we develop warp or perhaps an ASI. Ball also hypothesized a lesser known version of the Zoo Hypothesis, the Laboratory Hypothesis.</p><p>One possible rationale for the Zoo Hypothesis is that there exists a low number of interstellar civilizations in this galaxy and no intergalactic travel, combined with no panspermia, resulting in the possibility that an alien civilization might view us as part of the 42 answer <a href=""(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrases_from_The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy#Answer_to_the_Ultimate_Question_of_Life,_the_Universe,_and_Everything_(42))."">(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrases_from_The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy#Answer_to_the_Ultimate_Question_of_Life,_the_Universe,_and_Everything_(42)).</a> In the Laboratory Hypothesis, there may be slightly more interstellar civilizations, although not enough powerful factions for one to ignore the galactic consensus and break into the zoo, but there may be more &apos;tinkering&apos; in the zoo.</p><p>In the Zoo Hypothesis, the aliens have pretty strong stomachs for human suffering, including, recently, industrial genocide in the Second World War. However, zoos are  are always curated, i.e., there are potential intervention points by the zoo keepers, and interventions are more likely in the Laboratory Hypothesis. Thus, in the Zoo but more so in the Laboratory Hypothesis, an interstellar civilization or an alien ASI may have been tempted (Zoo Hypothesis) or conducted (Laboratory Hypothesis) very fine &apos;nudge-like&apos; <a href=""(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudge_theory)"">(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudge_theory)</a> interventions, to direct human development towards their own dominant philosophies.</p><p>Following the Second World War, a potential &apos;nudge&apos; was the 1946 Baruch Plan, the result of UN General Assembly Session 1, Article 1, which set up the UN Atomic Energy Commission (UN AEC).  If the UNAEC  had succeeded, this would have resulted in the US decommissioning its four atomic bombs and in the placing of all fission energy development under the UN in a kind of global &apos;Atoms for Peace&apos; plan. There could then have been a global peace, at the &apos;cost&apos; of soviet totalitarianism perhaps surviving into the present day. The Baruch Plan in the end broke down because the formula for peace was incorrect, and it possibly came down to one person; Baruch persuaded Truman that US popular support required a sanctions-proof punitive mechanism, and one did not exist at the time. This eventually torpedoed the negotiations, although there is a strong argument that Stalin would not have bought the deal on his side. See my analysis here, which relies on mainstream interpretations of the collapse of the Baruch Plan: <a href=""https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mrzua/"">https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mrzua/</a></p><p>The concept of Global Peace is especially interesting because it is a classic &apos;Three Wishes&apos; genie request, i.e., one that could quite easily be asked of, and granted by, a genie but which is fraught with difficulties in terms of the actual implementation. Still, in a weak Zoo Hypothesis or Laboratory Hypothesis situation, triggering &apos;Global Peace&apos; could be quite a coup for the intervening culture (see e.g., Iain M. Banks&apos; the Culture series). As such, the Baruch Plan and how to revisit it has attracted the attention of ASI philosophers, including Nick Bostrom in <em>Superintelligence</em>.</p><p>It appears to me that Covid 19 is another possible nudge intervention point where there actually exists a pragmatic pathway to Global Peace, this time with us much further along our timeline in terms of serious carrying capacity-related global problems, including biodiversity loss, and global warming, compared to 1946. Why? For the first time in in the 75-year history of the UN, on March 23, the UN Secretary-General called for a Covid 19-related Global Ceasefire, reiterating it on April 3 <a href=""(https://www.un.org/press/en/2020/sgsm20032.doc.htm)."">(https://www.un.org/press/en/2020/sgsm20032.doc.htm).</a></p><p>The &apos;Call&apos; has hit political difficulties, basically down to Trump and Putin, in a rehash of 1946 and the Baruch Plan. See <a href=""https://www.commondreams.org/news/2020/04/20/though-children-need-peace-now-more-ever-us-and-russia-block-un-efforts-impose."">https://www.commondreams.org/news/2020/04/20/though-children-need-peace-now-more-ever-us-and-russia-block-un-efforts-impose.</a> I personally think it will fail. However, Covid 19 is not the only &apos;Global Peace&apos; nudge point. In my article on the Trinity Test-level critical juncture, I suggest another, the &apos;burning plasma&apos; self-sustaining fusion reaction, which should occur around 2025-2035. The burning plasma scenario would be a revisit of the 1946 Baruch Plan scenario.</p><p>If my line of inquiry holds, the burning plasma may be a third external intervention nudge point, i.e., a third (and final?) &apos;wish attempt&apos;. If it is, we may expect the UN Secretary-General (or influential another) to call for Global Peace on the announcement of the burning plasma.</p><p>Open to comments.</p><p>P.S. On edit, given I&apos;m currently the leading academic exponent of the &apos;burning plasma&apos; global peace nude (sic) point, if the &apos;Weak Zoo/Laboratory Hypothesis&apos; &quot;global Peace&apos; wish scenario is correct, that could make me part of a Bostromesque counter-counter-factual Hail Mary cookie (</p><p><a href=""http://www.nickbostrom.com/papers/porosity.pdf),"">http://www.nickbostrom.com/papers/porosity.pdf),</a> which would be interesting. </p>",JohnCDraper,johncdraper,JohnCDraper,

GJphrRQmfiE6PzSqc,Tag Relevance Systems (Feedback Requested),tag-relevance-systems-feedback-requested,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/GJphrRQmfiE6PzSqc/tag-relevance-systems-feedback-requested,2020-04-23T01:29:56.165Z,25,8,5,True,False,,"<html><head></head><body><p>We recently launched our Tagging Beta (See <a href=""https://www.lessestwrong.com/posts/k7KokjJDhrEwjDwS7/site-meta-feature-update-more-tags-experimental"">here for the full anouncement</a>). We've spent the past few months thinking a lot about our longterm vision for tags on the site, but still have some uncertainty about exactly what shape tagging should take.</p><p>One major question that the team hadn't yet come to agreement on is how exactly to vote on Tag Relevance.</p><p>When you go to a tag page (such as the <a href=""https://www.lessestwrong.com/tag/rationality"">Rationality Tag</a>), somehow we have to decide which posts to list first. An obvious answer is ""just sort by karma"", but this isn't quite right: High karma posts aren't necessarily the most <i>relevant </i>posts.</p>
<p>For example, if ""Meditations on Moloch"" had originally been a LessWrong post, one might have tagged it ""economics"". (It does touch on economic concepts). And it might have gotten lots of upvotes because it was an evocative, powerfully written piece. But this wouldn't make it appropriate to be listed first on the Economics Tag Page.<p>So, we want some other system to determine how relevant a post is. And we want that system to be scalable, where lots of users could potentially go tagging posts and determining their relevance. But this leaves us needing a <strong>dispute mechanism</strong> – what happens if two people disagree?</p><p>We shipped the Tagging Beta with one such system, but are considering an alternative. I'd love your feedback.&nbsp;</p><h2>System 1: Karma-style Relevance</h2><p>We shipped with a system that simply re-used our existing Karma System. For each Tag-Post relationship, you can vote on how relevant the post is to the tag, using your normal array of upvotes/downvotes/weakvotes/strongvotes.&nbsp;</p><p>Here, relevance is a simple number. Higher relevance posts are sorted higher on the tag page. Posts are considered ""tagged"" if they have a positive amount of relevance. If you think a post was tagged incorrectly, you can downvote it to zero.</p><p>This system has some advantages and disadvantages. I'm going to describe my thoughts on those in the comments, so that you have a chance to form your own opinion if you want.</p><h2>System 2: Multiple Choice Voting</h2><p>There were some aspects of the Karma-Relevance system that I personally found dissatisfying. So I created an alternate system and pitched it to the team, and we collectively decided to present them both and give you guys the chance to give some feedback.</p><p>This system uses multiple-choice voting, where you sort the tag into one of five buckets. Within those buckets, posts are sorted by karma.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here's a video showing how that would work. (I recommended watching on fullscreen mode to more easily read the text)</p>

<iframe width=""640px"" height=""420px"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/wauznCqNV9g"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Instead of adding up votes to get a total relevance, this uses the median-vote to determine which bucket to put the post in. Then, on the tag page, all Top Relevance posts will be listed first (in karma order), followed by all High Relevance posts, then Medium, then Low.</p><p>Votes would still get vote-weight based on your karma, so established users can more easily counter an overzealous newbie who went on a tagging spree.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What do you think?</h2><p>In the comments, I'll go into more details about how each system works, and I think their relative merits are. But an important question is ""how intuitive is each system?"".</p><p>So for now, I'm just going to end the post asking for you to try out the current karma-relevance voting system (you can try upvoting this post for the Site Meta tag to get an idea of how that works), and to watch the video so you have an idea of what the new system would look like.</p><p>If you're up for it, it'd be quite helpful if you could write up your ""first impressions"" before reading the more detailed comments.</p></body></html>",Raemon,raemon,Raemon,

Sometimes, constraints are necessary. Constraints come with costs. Sometimes, the costs are worth it.</p>
<p>Aspiring researchers trying to think about AI alignment might<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-8gdCrzXPxrzn3eGF3-1"" id=""fnref-8gdCrzXPxrzn3eGF3-1"">[1]</a></sup> have a failure mode which goes something like… this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oh man, so we need to solve both outer and inner alignment to build a superintelligent agent which is competitive with unaligned approaches and also doesn't take much longer to train, and also we have to know this ahead of time. Maybe we could use some kind of prediction of what people want... but wait, <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/BKjJJH2cRpJcAnP7T/thoughts-on-human-models"">there's also problems with using human models</a>! How can it help people if it can't model people? Ugh, and <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/Rm6oQRJJmhGCcLvxh/p/iTpLAaPamcKyjmbFC"">what about self-modification</a>?! <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/Rm6oQRJJmhGCcLvxh/p/efWfvrWLgJmbBAs3m"">How is this agent even reasoning about the universe from inside the universe</a>?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The aspiring researcher slumps in frustration, mutters a curse under their breath, and hangs up their hat – ""guess this whole alignment thing isn't for me..."". And isn't that so? All their brain could do was pattern-match onto already-proposed solutions and cached thinking.</p>
<p>There's more than one thing going wrong here, but I'm just going to focus on one. Given that person's understanding of AI alignment, this problem is <em>wildly</em> overconstrained. Whether or not alignment research is right for them, there's just no way that anyone's brain is going to fulfill this insane solution request!</p>
<p>Sometimes, constraints are necessary. I think that the alignment community is pretty good at finding plausibly necessary constraints. Maybe some of the above <em>aren't</em> necessary – maybe there's One Clever Trick you come up with which obviates one of these concerns.</p>
<p>Constraints come with costs. Sometimes, the costs are worth it. In this context, I think the costs are very much worth it. Under this implicit framing of the problem, you're <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/w6BtMqKRLxG9bNLMr/the-catastrophic-convergence-conjecture"">pretty hosed</a> if you don't get even outer alignment right.</p>
<p>However, even if the real problem has crazy constraints, that doesn't mean you should immediately tackle the fully constrained problem. I think you should often <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relaxation_(approximation)"">relax</a> the problem first: eliminate or weaken constraints until you reach a problem which is still a little confusing, but which you can get some traction on.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even if you know an unbounded solution to chess, you might still be 47 years away from a bounded solution. But if you can't state a program that solves the problem in principle, you are in some sense confused about the nature of the cognitive work needed to solve the problem. If you can't even solve a problem given infinite computing power, you definitely can't solve it using bounded computing power. (Imagine Poe trying to write a chess-playing program before he'd had the insight about search trees.)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Historically, I tend to be too slow to relax research problems. On the flipside, <em>all of my favorite research ideas were directly enabled by problem relaxation</em>. Instead of just telling you what to do and then having you forget this advice in five minutes, I'm going to paint it into your mind using two stories.</p>
<h1>Attainable Utility Preservation</h1>
<p>It's spring of 2018, and I've written myself into a corner. My work with CHAI for that summer was supposed to be on impact measurement, but I <em>inconveniently</em> posted <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/DvmhXysefEyEvXuXS/overcoming-clinginess-in-impact-measures"">a convincing-to-me argument</a> that impact measurement cannot admit a clean solution:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I want to penalize the AI for having side effects on the world.<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-8gdCrzXPxrzn3eGF3-2"" id=""fnref-8gdCrzXPxrzn3eGF3-2"">[2]</a></sup> Suppose I have a function which looks at the consequences of the agent's actions and magically returns all of the side effects. Even if you have this function, you still have to assign blame for each effect – either the vase breaking was the AI's fault, or it wasn't.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If the AI penalizes itself for everything, it'll try to stop people from breaking vases – it'll be clingy. But if you magically have a model of how people are acting in the world, and the AI magically only penalizes itself for things which are its fault, then the AI is incentivized to blackmail people to break vases in ways which don't <em>technically</em> count as its fault. Oops.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Summer dawned, and I occupied myself with reading – lots and lots of reading. Eventually, enough was enough – I wanted to figure this out. I strode through my school's library, markers in my hand and determination in my heart. I was determined not to leave before understanding <em>a)</em> exactly why impact measurement is impossible to solve cleanly, or <em>b)</em> how to solve it.</p>
<p>I reached the whiteboard, and then – with adrenaline pumping through my veins – I realized that I had <em>no idea</em> what this ""impact"" thing even is. Oops.</p>
<p>I'm staring at the whiteboard.</p>
<p>A minute passes.</p>
<p>59 more minutes pass.</p>
<p>I'd been thinking about how, in hindsight, it was so important that Shannon had first written a perfect chess-playing algorithm which required infinite compute, that Hutter had written an AGI algorithm which required infinite compute. I didn't know how to solve impact under all the constraints, but what if I assumed something here?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What if I had infinite computing power? No… Still confused, don't see how to do it. Oh yeah, and what if the AI had a perfect world model. Hm... <em>What if we could write down a fully specified utility function which represented human preferences? Could I measure impact if I knew that?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The answer was almost trivially obvious. My first thought was that negative impact would be a decrease in true utility, but that wasn't quite right. I realized that impact measure needs to also capture decrease in ability to achieve utility. That's an optimal value function... So the negative impact would be the decrease in attainable utility for human values!<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-8gdCrzXPxrzn3eGF3-3"" id=""fnref-8gdCrzXPxrzn3eGF3-3"">[3]</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Okay, but we don't and won't know the ""true"" utility function. What if... we just penalized shift in all attainable utilities?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I then wrote down The Attainable Utility Preservation Equation, more or less. Although it took me a few weeks to believe and realize, <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/7CdoznhJaLEKHwvJW/p/75oMAADr4265AGK3L"">that equation solved all of the impact measurement problems</a> which had seemed so insurmountable to me just minutes before.<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-8gdCrzXPxrzn3eGF3-4"" id=""fnref-8gdCrzXPxrzn3eGF3-4"">[4]</a></sup></p>
<h1>Formalizing Instrumental Convergence</h1>
<p>It's spring of 2019, and I've written myself into a corner. <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yEa7kwoMpsBgaBCgb/towards-a-new-impact-measure"">My first post on AUP</a> was confusing – I'd failed to truly communicate what I was trying to say. Inspired by <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/Rm6oQRJJmhGCcLvxh""><em>Embedded Agency</em></a>, I was planning <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/7CdoznhJaLEKHwvJW"">an illustrated sequence of my own</a>.</p>
<p>I was working through a bit of reasoning on how your ability to achieve one goal interacts with your ability to achieve seemingly unrelated goals. Spending a lot of money on red dice helps you for the collecting-dice goal, but makes it harder to become the best juggler in the world. That's a weird fact, but it's an <em>important</em> fact which underlies much of <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4J4TA2ZF3wmSxhxuc/attainable-utility-preservation-empirical-results"">AUP's empirical success</a>.
I didn't understand why this fact was true.</p>
<p>At an impromptu presentation in 2018, I'd remarked that ""AUP wields instrumental convergence as a weapon against the alignment problem itself"". I tried thinking about it using the formalisms of reinforcement learning. Suddenly, I asked myself</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why is instrumental convergence even a thing?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I paused. I went outside for a walk, and I paced. The walk lengthened, and I still didn't understand why. Maybe it was just a ""brute fact"", an ""emergent"" phenomenon – nope, not buying that. There's an explanation somewhere.</p>
<p>I went back to the drawing board – to the whiteboard, in fact. I stopped trying to <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/7CdoznhJaLEKHwvJW/p/6DuJxY8X45Sco4bS2"">understand the general case</a> and I focused on specific toy environments. I'm looking at an environment like this</p>
<p><img src=""https://i.imgur.com/KEKaYrk.png"" alt=""""></p>
<p>and I'm thinking, most agents go from <code>1</code> to <code>3</code>. ""Why does my brain think this?"", I asked myself. Unhelpfully, my brain decided not to respond.</p>
<p>I'm staring at the whiteboard.</p>
<p>A minute passes.</p>
<p>29 more minutes pass.</p>
<p>I'm reminded of a paper my advisor had me read for my qualifying exam. The paper talked about a dual formulation for reinforcement learning environments, where you consider the available trajectories through the future instead of the available policies. I take a picture of the whiteboard and head back to my office.</p>
<p>I run into a friend. We start talking about work. I say, ""I'm about 80% sure I have the insight I need – this is how I felt in the past in situations like this, and I turned out to be right"".</p>
<p>I turned out to be right. I started building up an entire theory of this dual formalism. Instead of asking myself about the general case of instrumental convergence in arbitrary computable environments, I considered small deterministic Markov decision processes. I started proving everything I could, building up my understanding piece by piece. This turned out to make all difference.</p>
<p>Half a year later, I'd built up enough theory that <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6DuJxY8X45Sco4bS2/seeking-power-is-provably-instrumentally-convergent-in-mdps"">I was able to explain a great deal (but not everything) about instrumental convergence</a>.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Problem relaxation isn't always the right tactic. For example, if the problem isn't well-posed, it won't work well – imagine trying to ""relax"" the ""problem"" of free will! However, I think it's often the right move.</p>
<p>The move itself is simple: consider the simplest instance of the problem which is still confusing. Then, make a ton simplifying assumptions while still keeping part of the difficulty present – don't assume away all of the difficulty. Finally, tackle the relaxed problem.</p>
<p>In general, this seems like a skill that successful researchers and mathematicians learn to use. MIRI does a lot of this, for example. If you're new to the research game, this might be one of the crucial things to pick up on. Even though I detailed how this has worked for me, I think I could benefit from relaxing more.</p>
<p>The world is going to hell. You might be working on a hard (or even an impossible) problem. We plausibly stand on the precipice of extinction and utter annihilation.</p>
<p>Just relax.</p>
<p><em>This is meant as a reference post. I'm not the first to talk using problem relaxation in this way. For example, see <a href=""https://arbital.com/p/unbounded_analysis/"">The methodology of unbounded analysis</a>.</em></p>

<p>However, I kept staring at the strange equation – I kept trying to break it, to find some obvious loophole which would send me back to the drawing board. I never found it. Looking back over a year later, <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/S8AGyJJsdBFXmxHcb/attainable-utility-preservation-scaling-to-superhuman#Appendix__Remaining_Problems"">AUP does presently have loopholes</a>, but they're not obvious, nor should they have sent me back to the drawing board.</p>

Founding a holiday is not normally the best solution to a problem, but it sometimes is, and I’ve spent <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/3bbvzoRA8n6ZgbiyK"">~10 years thinking about why/when/how to do it</a>.</p><p>Recently, I awoke in the middle of the night with a thought:&nbsp;</p><p>There should be a holiday designed, from the ground up, to be telepresent. Once a year, you should gather – not with the family who are geographically close, but those who are emotionally central to you, no matter the distance.</p><p>What should you gather to celebrate about?

We are forced to endure hardship, to rework our lives, to coordinate in challenging times… and to find new ways to remain connected despite physical isolation. The story of COVID-19 is actually comparable to the events that most holidays are founded to commemorate. It’s also a <i>very weird event</i>, which gives a holiday lots of little narrative hooks for unique things that help it stand out.<br><br>I think a holiday focused on that would have a lot of narrative power, and it would fill an actual important need. I think there are concrete reasons people may benefit from a telepresent holiday <i>right now</i>, but I also predict that coronavirus will have long-lasting impacts that will make it reasonable to commemorate in future years (Although the narrative may need to change over time to account for new facts coming to light. We’re living through history right now)</p><p>It’s the 21st century, and we <i>should</i> be expecting holidays and traditions to adapt to changing technology. There should be at least one holiday where “skyping in to see your family” is not awkwardly bolted on afterwards, but deeply interwoven into the central traditions.</p><h2>Seder in Quarantine</h2><p>Last week I participated in an online Seder – a Jewish holiday where traditionally, family gather for a ceremonial dinner and read from an ancient text, telling the story of how their ancestors were liberated from Egypt. Some Jewish friends of mine had written a “rationalist” version of the text.<br><br>This year, due to Covid-19 it was necessary to hold the Seder remotely –&nbsp;people made their own dinner, assembled their own plate of ritually symbolic food, and read from a custom booklet over Zoom. We weren’t alone –&nbsp;my facebook feed had other friends organizing online seders. The <a href=""https://www.newyorker.com/cartoons/daily-cartoon/wednesday-april-8th-zoom-passover-seder""><u>New Yorker featured this cartoon</u></a>, showcasing families coming together over videochat:</p><figure><img src=""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/eD3GILFzMn90jBVuxVkF4PQUeHfXxld3KwLIYEEBU6-s6v_mzEGIbOdBmMRXbtOz4K2Ez5TAg0ULtd408QF4dvT6ctjfiUmO9O2oeD2PQj7hl2PKFp_CNaLg1UJuCjleDyzTgfZB""></figure><p><i>“Why is this night different from all other nights?”</i></p><p>Rationalist Seder was exactly what I needed –&nbsp;it brought a bunch of people together and gave me a sense of normalcy/connection that felt a bit stronger than the previous ad-hoc Zoom Parties I’d attended during quarantine.&nbsp;</p><p>And the nature of Seder leant itself well to a video call –&nbsp;the reading is “turn based”, so people don’t accidentally interrupt each other the way they sometimes do on teleconference. After the reading, we each brought our own dinner over to our laptops and ate together and chatted for a bit. There were a few hiccups, but it fit together surprisingly effectively.&nbsp;</p><p>Because it wasn’t bound by geography, there were friends from Seattle, Boston, Berkeley, and other places.</p><p>I wanted to tell all my friends “hey! Are you feeling lonely and disconnected? Try a Seder!”... but, well, I’m not Jewish, and most people aren’t Jewish, and… the story of Seder really deeply assumes “you are a part of Jewish history, or at least the people hosting the event are.”&nbsp;</p><p>So this wasn’t really a scalable solution. But it <i>was</i> a proof-of-concept.</p><h2>Possible Pillars of a Covid Holiday</h2><p>This is all in the “brainstorming” phase, but after thinking ~5 hours, my best guesses for the central constraints here are:</p><p><strong>Mechanical Pillars</strong></p><ol><li>Everyone is on a video call.<i> </i>I might even advocate that people who share a house split into separate rooms, so that everyone can be un-muted and wear a headset, avoiding echo and background noise. (I also think it works as a symbolic action –&nbsp;in future years, it’ll be commemorating a time when many people were isolated)</li><li>There’s a central text, everyone takes turns reading through. Some people may care most about the intellectual content of that text, others might mostly see it as an excuse to get together and the main purpose is socializing afterwards. This seems fine. But even for “basically-just-want-to-socialize” people, I think having the text gives a sense of purpose to the socialization.<br><br>The text may evolve over time, or different people might create versions that fit their needs. But I think there can be commonalities across versions.</li><li>People make themselves dinner, using ingredients with a long shelf life.</li></ol><p>Other traditions may turn out to be good ideas, but I’m pretty sure these three things will make for a solid foundation.</p><p><strong>Thematic Pillars</strong></p><p>Three interwoven themes would be Preparedness, Resilience, and Connection.</p><ol><li><i>Preparedness</i>.&nbsp;A century ago, Spanish flu infected a third of the world’s population. We know what pandemics are, and we know roughly how to prepare. But it’s easy for disasters to fade from living memory.&nbsp;<br><br>One purpose of holidays is to remember things that are important, but easy to forget. I think the story of Covid is important both for remembering pandemics-in-particular, and for generally thinking in advance about rare-but-disastrous events.<br>&nbsp;</li><li><i>Resilience.</i> Across the world, I see many people screwing up, often disastrously. But I also see a tremendous display of people figuring out how to respond.&nbsp;<br><br>I see a fractal pattern where, at every level (international, national, individual cities/states/provinces, and local communities and households), folk are saying “Geez. We need to respond to this. I need to make sure my people are safe. I want to make sure I can help.”<br>&nbsp;</li><li><i>Connection.</i> After making sure their families were safe, people went one-level-up the Needs Hierarchy and asked “How can I make sure I stay connected with friends and family, in this challenging, isolated time?”<br><br>And… I think there was something important going on here that predated coronavirus. I think there’s been a vague sense of unease about thee last century, where rapidly changing technology has transformed a lot of social norms. It’s not always clear when this was for-the-better, and when it’s been for-the-worse. And even changes that were for-the-better can still be locally disruptive.</li></ol><p>Coronavirus might be something of an inflection point: the point where the dominant social narrative shifts from “technology keeps changing in ways that are hard to keep up with and might be subtly bad” to “we can take ownership over changing technology and decide, on purpose, what sort of social connection we want in the 21st century.”<br><br>The fact that young and old people have all been forced to adapt together makes me more optimistic about this being a shared shift.</p><h2>Global Scale?</h2><p>Previous holidays I’ve worked on were focused on one particular community with a shared worldview. Something I feel excited about here is that I think this is a moment when a large fraction of humanity is experiencing the same hardships, and working on the same problems. And the conflict is “Human vs Nature”, rather than “Human vs Human”, which has the potential for a sense of unity.</p><p>But there are some obvious things to worry about here:</p><ul><li>Partisan Politics</li><li>Localization</li></ul><p><strong>Partisan Politics</strong></p><p>A central aspect of the coronavirus story is “people were often unprepared, and often didn’t handle it well –&nbsp;especially at first.” I think an easy, accidentally bad outcome to have here is for people with different opinions about Who Screwed Up Worse to end up fighting a lot. (Or, for the overall holiday to end up having more of a partisan slant than I think is ideal)&nbsp;</p><p>I can imagine stereotypical “Thanksgiving Arguments” (where Aunt Alice and Uncle Bob drunkenly yell about which politicians suck most) being dialed up to 11 here, and accidentally officially enshrined into the holiday.</p><p>I think this might actually turn out to be a dealbreaker for the version of this Holiday Plan where it tries to go global, rather than be a weird niche holiday for weird niche people.</p><p>A related failure mode would be to focus on overly-specific beliefs/worldviews/solutions. This could be bad for two reasons: not everyone agrees on exact solutions or best practices, and getting into the weeds may be unproductive.</p><p>My first guess for how to alleviate that problem is to build into the narrative text “Various people made many mistakes. It <i>is</i> important to hold people accountable for mistakes, and to do better next time. But this holiday is not about that. This is about the struggles we went through together, and heroism we displayed that we hopefully can agree on.”</p><p><strong>Localization (and Globalization)</strong></p><p>I live in America. In California in particular. My experience of what coronavirus means is shaped by my national and local government response, and my local culture.&nbsp;</p><p>I assume people in China, or Singapore, or Italy, or India, each have very different experiences of what coronavirus was about, what lessons to learn, what exact hardships they endured (or in some cases didn’t) and how they responded.</p><p>In general, I think it’s better when holidays are Specific. Don’t try to tell a vague story that isn’t really exciting to anyone. Tell a specific story that you deeply believe in, that you think is worth celebrating every year. Maybe only a small number of people will also believe in that story, but if the story is Good and True, more people will come to believe it in, and your cultural artifact will have a stronger core.</p><p>It so happens in this case, there is a story that is <i>quite</i> specific, while being much broader in scale than usual.</p><p>For the immediate future, my guess is that the target audience for this holiday should be “People who underwent self-isolaiton in response to coronavirus, or know many people who did.” This does not mean <i>everyone</i> –&nbsp;I think there might be underdeveloped nations with high population densities where the dominant thing was not quarantine, but crumbling infrastructure and economic collapse, and an appropriate response was not quarantine.</p><p>I think that scope is narrow enough to draw focus, while still being global in scale.</p><p>Jim Babcock’s <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Mq9wOaBBACX6_i5G9R2rtjIbnaW03BoN86CnsUhNG4g/edit""><u>Petrov Day ceremony</u></a> (another Seder-inspired holiday), draws a lot of power from it’s global scale, finding quotes from people across the world during the Cold War. It’s probably still filtered through an American perspective, but I think it showcases how to assemble a narrative from different viewpoints.&nbsp;</p><p>My guess is that the initial “Proof of Concept” text for a Covid Holiday should aim to be similar (with perhaps an even greater focus on what people in different places experienced, using direct quotes where possible).</p><p>Later, if this thing actually took off, I would expect people to adapt the text to be more relevant to them.</p><h2>Quality Writing</h2><p>Rationalist Solstice and Petrov Day each took a couple years to &nbsp;get their footing IMO. In each case, it mattered a lot that eventually someone wrote a centerpiece story that was <i>highly polished, resonant, and meaningful.</i> Each of those holidays underwent a transition in my mind, from “a neat thing to do with friends” to “Actually A Meaningful Highlight of My Year.”</p><p>I’m confident that Covid can support such stories, but not sure they can be found or written soon enough to provide a text <i>this year. </i>I do trust that in the longterm it’s a quite solvable problem tho.</p><h2>How to handle Connection</h2><p>Somewhat weird digression:</p><p><strong>The Story of the Desert Ancestors</strong></p><p>There’s a fantasy series (I’m deliberately avoiding naming it for spoilers, and may be misremembering details), where the protagonist meets a civilization of “barbarians” that live in the desert. They live in small tribes, but sometimes they come together for larger festivals. During those times, sometimes a ceremony is conducted where someone is welcomed as an adult.&nbsp;</p><p>That person stands up, and says their name. Then they say the name of their mother. And then their mother’s mother. And mother’s mother’s mother.</p><p>Whenever they get to a name where someone else in the room has the same ancestor, that person stands up and states that ancestor’s name as well.&nbsp;</p><p>Soon, this means that their immediate family is standing up with them, chanting names backwards in time. Then, more distant cousins stand as well.</p><p>It ends with every member of their entire civilization standing, chanting the names of their earliest common ancestors.</p><p>At some point in the story, they encounter a foreign “savage pigmy” character. There’s a nearby race of people that the desert civilization is sometimes at war with. They don’t speak the same language. It’s not clear whether they’re even the same species.</p><p>But one member of that other race gets captured by the protagonist’s tribe. He is injured, and ends up living with them and proving his worth.</p><p>Eventually, he is inducted into the tribe. The ceremony is awkward. He stands up alone, and nervously speaks the name of his name, and his mother’s, and grandmothers. Despite being a different culture, he too has memorized the list of his ancestors.</p><p>He works backwards in time, dozens of generations. Until suddenly, he hits a name, and someone else in the hall sits bolt-upright, surprised. That person stands up, uncertain, but then says the name too.</p><p>Soon, that person’s family is also standing, chanting names backwards in time. Then more people join. And finally, the entire tribe stands together, the newcomer included, stating the names of the distant mothers they all share.</p><p>That was a beautiful idea to me. It was a powerful example of a ritual that made me go “Man, I wish I could be part of something like <i>that.</i>”</p><p><strong>21st Century Social Structures</strong></p><p>I bring this up, not because I think this is directly relevant, but to highlight the sort of <i>feeling</i> that I’d like to aspire to with the telepresence and connection aspects of this holiday.</p><p>I don’t have great ideas for how to capture that feeling, given our existing culture.</p><p>It used to be that people all lived in close geographic areas. You didn’t have that many options about who your friends were, or who your family was, or where you worked, or what your traditions were. This created a set of constraints on how to survive, and build a culture, and find meaning.</p><p>In the past couple centuries, this began changing. People move cities in chase of employment or romantic prospects. Longterm multigenerational social networks are harder to support. By now, at least in the West, atomic individualism is quite strong, and technology rapidly changes.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=""http://bowlingalone.com/""><u>Bowling Alone</u></a> was written 20 years ago, and documents how in America, community involvement declined between the 50s and the 90s, across most metrics. I don’t know for sure how the past 2 decades have changed that, but I still have a sense of “many people haven’t quite figured out what kind of social structures they want in the 21st century.”</p><p>(Notably, I expect countries to vary on this dimension. My understanding is that China, particularly relevant here, is still particularly collectivist, although I don’t know much about the details. I expect different cultures to have different needs here. But I expect enough people to have this problem that it’s worth thinking about, through the lens of a telepresent holiday)</p><p>What seems significant to me is that telepresence lends itself to strengthening longterm ties. Maybe, as we move to new cities, we can cultivate stronger ties with the people we’re leaving physically behind.</p><p><strong>How many people do you invite?</strong></p><p>A question that comes up immediately, if you remove the geographic constraint (as well as the “people have to fit around one dinner table” constraint), is “okay, how many people do you actually invite?”</p><p>One original motivator for me here was realizing that my family used to celebrate Christmas All Together, but as people moved farther away it was harder for everyone to get together. And then thinking “maybe we might want to actually get All Together over Zoom?”</p><p>But, I wouldn’t want more than 25-30 people all at once. And whether I’m holding the event “for family” or “for friends”, it’s not clear where I’d want to draw the line –&nbsp;sooner or later you have to exclude <i>someone</i> who I’m actually fairly close with.</p><p>It’s also fairly common in holidays to have a space open for neighbors, or friends-of-guests. I think this actually serves an important role of giving people some incidental exposure to each other, and for people who don’t have as many friends to have an opportunity to get closer to people. But it creates a bit of awkwardness around “well, you invite random guest Carol, who you don’t even know that well, but you didn’t invite George, who you’re pretty good friends with [but, George happened to be in your top 100 favorite people instead of top 20].”</p><p>I’m unsure what to do about this</p><p><strong>One (Insufficient) Guess</strong></p><p>I haven’t come up with anything yet that feels as powerful to me as the story of the Desert Civilization Ancestors, nor that really addresses the “who to invite?” problem. But here is a stab at a connection-focused tradition:</p><p>Have one person host the holiday. They choose a smallish number of people that they want to deliberately cultivate longterm connection with.&nbsp;</p><p>Those people each invite ~two other people, with some eye for compatibility with who was in the first-order invite list.</p><p>The idea is <i>not</i> that all these people are going to be close friends forever. But they are choosing to share a moment in time, reflecting on how they fit into each other’s longterm lives.&nbsp;</p><p>The first phase of the event focuses on The Story of Covid (this is useful to ease people into the experience without having to immediately force a feeling of intimacy). In the the second phase (possibly after eating dinner), people take turns selecting 1 or 2 people in the group, and talking about why they invited that person, and what that person means to them.</p><p>I’m not sure how rigorous to be about it, but I think it makes sense if the first person to get welcomed is the person with the fewest social ties to the group, and for the final person to get welcomed is the original host.</p><p><strong>Why this guess seems insufficient</strong></p><p>There’s a lot I like about the above, but it suffers from a core problem of “actually, many people seem to have nowhere near enough default connection already established to really be able to do the above.”</p><p>Most “small dinner” holidays I’ve celebrated (at least with friends) had a large number of people who didn’t initially know each other. Nonetheless, over time, I came to value them, and I now consider many of them to be something-like-family to me.</p><p>So I think there’s something important to actually have a social structure for “everyone is invited”.</p><p>Meanwhile, an alternate problem is: “Jumpstarting Intimacy is Dangerous.”</p><p>Sometimes it falls flat, or just feels a bit awkward. Other times, people who try to cultivate too much intimacy end up feeling betrayed. (I have been personally responsible for one such betrayal, which I deeply regret, and wish I had not put myself in a position where I had to decide what to do with someone’s vulnerable information).</p><p>So by now I expressly disendorse “create an environment where people feel inclined to escalate intimacy dramatically.” (Though I do think creating an environment where people are given the opportunity to escalate it by ~1 notch is fine).</p><h2>Tying this All Together</h2><p>Whew. That was a lot of thoughts. In quick review, I think:</p><ol><li>The story of humanity and coronavirus is a mythic level event. We’re still living through history and I don’t quite know how things will turn out. But I’m fairly confident it will be a story worth reflecting on for decades to come.</li><li>Independent of the previous point, the time is ripe for a holiday focusing explicitly on telepresence and connection.</li><li>Mechanically, it could focus on Video Calls, Turn-Based Reading or Sharing, and Dinner Made Of Long Shelf Life Ingredients.</li><li>Thematically, it could focus on Preparedness, Resilience, and Connection.</li><li>People can dial up or down individual themes, or adapt the text, to fit the things that are important to them.</li><li>I think it should deliberately avoid partisan politics to the extent that is possible (while not being unopinionated on the higher level narrative)</li></ol><p>There’s a lot of unsolved problems remaining and work to be done. I will be honest –&nbsp;I’m not 100% sure I’ll have the time needed to do this justice.&nbsp;</p><p>For right now, I am curious whether this resonates with people. If I did a ton of writing (and collecting writing), logistical work, etc, is this something you can imagine yourself wanting?</p></body></html>",Raemon,raemon,Raemon,

I suspect that every reader will have some section they&apos;re interested in. Since much of the discussion was itself meant to be a summary, I&apos;m not going to try and summarize even further.

However, there has not been much followup research since the publication of the report. This document posits that this is because the concepts of tasks and services introduced in the report are not amenable to formalization, and so it is hard to do research with them. So, it provides a classification of the types of research that could be done (e.g. do we consider the presence of one human, or many humans?), a list of several research problems that could be tackled now, and a simple abstract model of a system of services that could be built on in future work.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> I was expecting a research paradigm that was more specific to AI, but in reality it is very broad and feels to me like an agenda around &quot;how do you design a good society in the face of technological development&quot;. For example, it includes unemployment, system maintenance, the potential of blackmail, side-channel attacks, prevention of correlated errors, etc. None of this is to say that the problems aren&apos;t <em>important</em> -- just that given how broad they are, I would expect that they could be best tackled using many different fields, rather than being important for AI researchers in particular to focus on.</p><h2>LEARNING HUMAN INTENT </h2><p><strong><a href=""https://medium.com/@PartnershipAI/aligning-ai-to-human-values-means-picking-the-right-metrics-855859e6f047"">Aligning AI to Human Values means Picking the Right Metrics</a></strong> <em>(Jonathan Stray)</em> (summarized by Rohin): There has been a lot of attention recently on the flaws of recommender systems, especially when optimizing for simple metrics like engagement -- an example of what we might call &quot;narrow value alignment&quot;. This post reconstructs how Facebook and YouTube have been incorporating better metrics into their algorithms from 2015 and 2017 respectively. For example, Facebook found that academic research suggested that well-being was improved by &quot;meaningful social interactions&quot;, but worsened by passive consumption of content. As a result, they changed the metric for the recommendation algorithm to better track this. How did they measure it? It seems that they simply asked a survey of thousands of people what the most meaningful content was (both on and off Facebook), and used this to train a model to predict &quot;meaningful interactions&quot;. They estimated that this resulted in a 5% decrease in time spent on Facebook, at least in the short term. The story with YouTube is similar, though sparser on details (and it&apos;s not clear if there was input from end users in YouTube&apos;s case).</p><p>The author then contrasts this sort of narrow value alignment with AGI alignment. His main take is that narrow alignment should be easier to address, since we can learn from how existing systems behave in the real world, and the insights we gain may be critical for AGI alignment. I&apos;ll end with a quote from the conclusion: &quot;My argument is not so much that one should use AI to optimize for well-being. Rather, we live in a world where large-scale optimization is already happening. We can choose not to evaluate or adjust these systems, but there is little reason to imagine that ignorance and inaction would be better.&quot;</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> Even though I often feel like an <strong><a href=""https://aiimpacts.org/conversation-with-rohin-shah/"">optimist</a></strong> (<strong><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/b3dc916ac7e2/an-80-why-ai-risk-might-be-solved-without-additional-intervention-from-longtermists"">AN #80</a></strong>) about incentives towards alignment, even I was surprised to see the amount of effort that it seems Facebook has put into trying to align its recommendation algorithm with well-being. To the extent that the recommendation algorithm is still primarily harmful (which might be true or false, idk), this suggests to me that it might just be really hard to give good recommendations given the sparse feedback you get. Of course, there are more cynical explanations, e.g. Facebook just wants to look like they care about well-being, but if they really cared they could do way better. I lean towards the first explanation, but it&apos;s very hard to distinguish between these hypotheses.</p><p>While this post claimed that narrow value alignment should be easier than AGI alignment, I&apos;m actually not so sure. With AGI alignment, you have the really powerful assumption that the AI system you are trying to align is <em>intelligent</em>: this could plausibly help a lot. For example, maybe the recommender systems that Facebook is using are just incapable of predicting what will and won&apos;t improve human well-being, in which case narrow alignment is doomed. This wouldn&apos;t be the case with an AGI (depending on your definition of AGI) -- it should be capable of doing at least as well as humans do. The challenge is in ensuring that the AI systems are actually <strong><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/ZeE7EKHTFMBs8eMxn/clarifying-ai-alignment"">motivated</a></strong> (<strong><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/b6dc636f6a1b/alignment-newsletter-33"">AN #33</a></strong>) to do so, not whether they are capable of doing so; with narrow alignment you need to solve both problems.</p><p><strong><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04465"">LESS is More: Rethinking Probabilistic Models of Human Behavior</a></strong> <em>(Andreea Bobu, Dexter R.R. Scobee et al)</em> (summarized by Asya): This paper introduces a new model for robots inferring human preferences called LESS. The traditional Boltzmann noisily-rational decision model assumes people approximately optimize a reward function and choose trajectories in proportion to their exponentiated reward. The Boltzmann model works well when modeling decisions among different discrete options, but runs into problems when modeling human trajectories in a continuous space, e.g. path finding, because it is very sensitive to the number of trajectories, even if they are similar-- if a robot using a Boltzmann model must predict whether a human navigates around an obstacle by taking one path on the left or one of three very-similar paths on the right, it will assign the same probability to each path by default.</p><p>To fix this, LESS predicts human behavior by treating each trajectory as part of a continuous space and mapping each one to a feature vector. The likelihood of selecting a trajectory is inversely proportional to its feature-space similarity with other trajectories, meaning similar trajectories are appropriately deweighted.</p><p>The paper tests the predictive performance of LESS vs. Boltzmann in several experimental environments, including an artifically constructed task where humans are asked to choose between similar paths for navigating around an obstacle, and a real-world task where humans demonstrate appropriate behaviors to a 7-degree-of-freedom robotic arm. In general, LESS performs better than Boltzmann when given a small number of samples of human behavior, but does equally well as the sample size is increased. In the robotic arm task, Boltzmann performed better when demonstrations were aggregated into a single batch and inference was run on the whole batch at once, representing trying to approximate the &apos;average&apos; user rather than customizing behavior to each user. The paper claims that this happens because Boltzmann overlearns from demonstrations in sparse regions, and underlearns from dense demonstrations. As you increase the number of samples, you approximate the &#x201C;true&#x201D; trajectory space better and better, so the 10 trajectory sets vary less and less, which means Boltzmann won&#x2019;t underperform so much. Since the single batch demonstration aggregated demonstrations, it had a similar effect in approximating the &quot;true&quot; trajectory space.</p><p>The paper notes that one limitation of this method is a reliance on a pre-specified set of robot features, though a small set of experimental results suggested that LESS still performed better than Boltzmann when adding a small number of irrelevant features.</p><p><strong>Asya&apos;s opinion:</strong> This seems like a good paper, and seems very much like the natural extension of Boltzmann models to include accounting for similar trajectories. As the paper notes, I largely worry about the reliance on a pre-specified set of robot features-- in more complicated cases of inference, it could be impractical to hand-specify relevant features and too difficult to have the robot infer them. In the worst case, it seems like misspecified features could make performance worse than Boltzmann via suggesting similarities that are irrelevant.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> (Note that this paper comes from the InterACT lab, which I am a part of.)</p><p>The Boltzmann model of human behavior has several theoretical justifications: it&apos;s the maximum entropy (i.e. <strong><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_maximum_entropy"">minimum encoded information</a></strong>) distribution over trajectories subject to the constraint that the feature expectations match those of the observed human behavior; it&apos;s the maximum entropy distribution under the assumption that humans satisfice for expected reward above some threshold, etc. I have never found these very compelling, and instead see it as something far simpler: you want your model to encode the fact that humans are more likely to take good actions than bad actions, and you want your model to assign non-zero probability to all trajectories; the Boltzmann model is the simplest model that meets these criteria. (You could imagine removing the exponential in the model as &quot;even simpler&quot;, but this is equivalent to a monotonic transformation of the reward function.) </p><p>I view this paper as proposing a model that meets my two criteria before, and adds in a third one: when we can cluster trajectories based on similarity, then we should view the human as choosing between <em>clusters</em>, rather than choosing between trajectories. Given a good similarity metric, this seems like a much better model of human behavior -- if I&apos;m walking and there&apos;s a tree in my path, I will choose which side of the tree to go around, but I&apos;m not going to put much thought into exactly where my footsteps will fall.</p><p>I found the claim that Boltzmann overlearns in sparse areas to be unintuitive, and so I delved into it deeper in this <strong><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/TmHRACaxXrLbXb5tS/rohinmshah-s-shortform?commentId=Hb6m2C9wtKWTzYL8d"">comment</a></strong>. My overall takeaway was that the claim will often hold in practice, but it isn&apos;t guaranteed.</p><h2>PREVENTING BAD BEHAVIOR </h2><p><strong><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/fSC98Cy3zR9GsEPnT/curiosity-killed-the-cat-and-the-asymptotically-optimal"">Curiosity Killed the Cat and the Asymptotically Optimal Agent</a></strong> <em>(Michael Cohen et al)</em> (summarized by Rohin): In environments without resets, an <em>asymptotically optimal</em> agent is one that eventually acts optimally. (It might be the case that the agent first hobbles itself in a decidedly suboptimal way, but <em>eventually</em> it will be rolling out the optimal policy <em>given</em> its current hobbled position.) This paper points out that such agents must explore a lot: after all, it&apos;s always possible that the very next timestep will be the one where chopping off your arm gives you maximal reward forever -- how do you <em>know</em> that&apos;s not the case? Since it must explore so much, it is extremely likely that it will fall into a &quot;trap&quot;, where it can no longer get high reward: for example, maybe its actuators are destroyed.</p><p>More formally, the paper proves that when an asymptotically optimal agent acts, for any event, either that event occurs, or after some finite time there is no recognizable opportunity to cause the event to happen, even with low probability. Applying this to the event &quot;the agent is destroyed&quot;, we see that either the agent is eventually destroyed, or it becomes <em>physically impossible</em> for the agent to be destroyed, even by itself -- given that the latter seems rather unlikely, we would expect that eventually the agent is destroyed.</p><p>The authors suggest that safe exploration is not a well-defined problem, since you never know what&apos;s going to happen when you explore, and they propose that instead agents should have their exploration guided by a mentor or <strong><a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06766"">parent</a></strong> (<strong><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/534f448d6c8b/alignment-newsletter-53"">AN #53</a></strong>) (see also <strong><a href=""https://intelligence.org/2019/04/24/delegative-reinforcement-learning/"">delegative RL</a></strong> (<strong><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/392d2043e782/an-57why-we-should-focus-on-robustness-in-ai-safety-and-the-analogous-problems-in-programming"">AN #57</a></strong>), <strong><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.05173"">avoiding catastrophes via human intervention</a></strong>, and <strong><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.08611"">shielding</a></strong> for more examples).</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> In my opinion on <strong><a href=""https://openai.com/blog/safety-gym/"">Safety Gym</a></strong> (<strong><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/1106d0ce6766/an-76how-dataset-size-affects-robustness-and-benchmarking-safe-exploration-by-measuring-constraint-violations"">AN #76</a></strong>), I mentioned how a zero-violations constraint for safe exploration would require a mentor or parent that already satisfied the constraint; so in that sense I agree with this paper, which is simply making that statement more formal and precise.</p><p>Nonetheless, I still think there is a meaningful notion of exploration that can be done safely: once you have learned a good model that you have reasonable confidence in, you can find areas of the model in which you are uncertain, but you are at least confident that it won&apos;t have permanent negative repercussions, and you can explore there. For example, I often &quot;explore&quot; what foods I like, where I&apos;m uncertain of how much I will like the food, but I&apos;m quite confident that the food will not poison and kill me. (However, this notion of exploration is quite different from the notion of exploration typically used in RL, and might better be called &quot;model-based exploration&quot; or something like that.)</p><h2>MISCELLANEOUS (ALIGNMENT) </h2><p><strong><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/u9Azdu6Z7zFAhd4rK/bayesian-evolving-to-extinction"">Bayesian Evolving-to-Extinction</a></strong> <em>(Abram Demski)</em> (summarized by Rohin): Consider a Bayesian learner, that updates the weights of various hypotheses using Bayes Rule.

There was some disagreement and (at least on my part) some confusion about what we were trying to learn from all of this. I think this comes from two separate, more general questions that can come up when forecasting future progress. These questions are closely related and both can be answered in part by analyzing discontinuities. First I will describe these questions generically, then I will explain how they can become confused in the context of analyzing discontinuous progress. </p>



<h2>Question 1: How did tech progress happen in the past? </h2>



<p>Knowing something about how historical progress happened is crucial to making good forecasts now, both from the standpoint of understanding the underlying mechanisms and establishing base rates. Merely being able to <em>describe what happened and why</em> can help us make sense of what’s happening now and should enable us to make better predictions. Such descriptions vary in scope and detail. For example:</p>



<ul><li>The number of transistors per chip doubled roughly every two years from 1970 to 2020</li><li>Wartime funding during WWII led to the rapid development and scaling of penicillin production, which contributed to a 90% decrease in US syphilis mortality from 1945 to 1967</li><li>Large jumps in metrics for technological progress were not always accompanied by fundamental scientific breakthroughs</li></ul>



<p>This sort of analysis may be used for other work, in addition to forecasting rates of progress. In the context of our work on discontinuities, answering this question mostly consists of describing quantitatively how metrics for progress evolve over time.</p>



<h2>Question 2: How would we have fared making predictions in the past?</h2>



<p>This is actually a family of questions aimed at developing and calibrating prediction methods based on historical data. These are questions like:</p>



<ul><li>If, in the past, we’d predicted that the current trend would hold, how often and by how much would we have been wrong?</li><li>Are there domains in which we’d have fared better than others?</li><li>Are there heuristics we can use to make better predictions?</li><li>Which methods for characterizing trends in progress would have performed the best?</li><li>How often would we have seen hints that a discontinuity or change in rate of progress was about to happen?</li></ul>



<h2>These questions often, but not always, require the same approach</h2>



<p>In the context of our work on discontinuous progress, these questions converge on the same methods most of the time. For many of our metrics, there was a clear trend leading up to a discontinuity, and describing what happened is essentially the same as attempting to (naively) predict what would have happened if the discontinuity had not happened. But there are times when they differ. In particular, this can happen when we have different information now than we would have had at the time the discontinuity happened, or when the naive approach is clearly missing something important. Three cases of this that come to mind are:</p>



<p><strong>The trend leading up to the discontinuity was ambiguous, but later data made it less ambiguous.</strong> For example, advances in steamships improved times for crossing the Atlantic, but it was not clear whether this progress was exponential or linear at the time that flight or telecommunications were invented. But if we look at progress that occurred for transatlantic ship voyages after flight, we can see that the overall trend was linear. If we want to answer the question “What happened?”, we might say that progress in steamships was linear, so that it would have taken 500 years at the rate of advancement for steamships to bring crossing time down to that of the first transatlantic flight. If we want to answer the question “How much would this discontinuity have affected our forecasts at the time?”, we might say that it looked exponential, so that our forecasts would have been wrong by a substantially shorter amount of time.</p>



<p><strong>We now have access to information from before the discontinuity that nobody (or no one person) had access to at the time. </strong>In the past, the world was much less connected, and it is not clear who knew about what at the time. For example, <a href=""https://aiimpacts.org/discontinuity-from-the-burj-khalifa/"">building heights</a>, <a href=""https://aiimpacts.org/discontinuity-in-altitude-records/"">altitude records</a>, <a href=""https://aiimpacts.org/historic-trends-in-bridge-span-length/"">bridge spans</a>, and <a href=""https://aiimpacts.org/effects-of-breech-loading-rifles-on-historic-trends-in-firearm-progress/"">military capabilities</a> all showed progress across different parts of the world, and it seems likely that nobody had access to all the information that we have now, so that forecasting may have been much harder or yielded different results. Information that is actively kept secret may have made this problem worse. It seems plausible that nobody knew the state of both the Manhattan Project and the German nuclear weapons program at the time that the first nuclear weapon was tested in 1945.</p>



<p><strong>The inside view overwhelms the outside view.</strong> For example, the second <a href=""https://aiimpacts.org/historic-trends-in-transatlantic-message-speed/"">transatlantic telegraph cable</a> was much, much better than the first. Using our methodology, it was nearly as large an advancement over the first cable as the first cable was over mailing by ship. But we lose a lot by viewing these advances only in terms of their deviation from the previous trend. The first cable had extremely poor performance, while the second performed about as well as a typical high performance telegraph cable did at the time. If we were trying to predict future progress at the time, we’d focus on questions like “How long do we think it will take to get a normal cable working?” or “How soon will it be until someone is willing to fund the next cable laying expedition?”, not “If we draw a line through the points on this graph, where does that take us?” (Though that outside view may still be worth consideration.) However, if we’re just trying to <em>describe how the metric evolved over time</em>, then the correct thing to do <em>is</em> to just draw a line through the points as best we can and calculate how far off-trend the new advancement is. </p>



<h2>Reasons for focusing more on the descriptive approach for now</h2>



<p>Both of these questions are important, and we can’t really answer one while totally ignoring the other. But for now, we have focused more on describing what happened (that is, answering question 1). </p>



<p>There are several reasons for this, but first I’ll describe <strong>some advantages to focusing on simulating historical predictions:</strong></p>



<ol><li>It mitigates what may be some misleading results from the descriptive approach. See, for example, the description of the transatlantic telegraph above.</li><li>We’re trying to do forecasting (or enable others to do it), and really good answers to these questions might be more valuable.</li></ol>



<p><strong>But, for now, I think the advantages to focusing on description are greater:</strong></p>



<ol><li>The results are more readily reusable for other projects, either by us or by others. For example, answering a question like “How much of an improvement is a typical major advancement over previous technology?”</li><li>It does not require us to model a hypothetical forecaster. It’s hard to predict what we (or someone else) would have predicted if asked about future progress in weapons technology just before the invention of nuclear weapons. To me, this process feels like it has a lot of moving parts or at least a lot of subjectivity, which leaves room for error, and makes it harder for other people to evaluate our methods.</li><li>It is easier to build from question 1 to question 2 than the other way around. A description of what happened is a pretty reasonable starting point for figuring out which forecasting methods would have worked.</li><li>It is easier to compare across technologies using question 1. Question 2 requires taking a more inside view, which makes comparisons harder.</li></ol>

If you miss your flight, you want to have already thought of a plan, because speed matters. If you already imagined that this was a possibility, then you are able to respond quicker/more adaptively. (Unfortunately, there is some sense in which you will need to think the fastest when it is the hardest to do so; your skills will leave you when you need them most if you don&apos;t prepare ahead of time.)</p><p>Secondly, if lets you appreciate good situations. If the uncertainty resolves positively, knowing <em>how much better</em> that was than a bad resolution makes you appreciate it more. If I don&apos;t miss my flight, knowing that I could <em>could have</em> makes me happier that I didn&apos;t miss it. (There&apos;s some sense in which this is benefit is a bit of psychological trickery that might make you uncomfortable. Remember that there is a difference between a <em>reason to do something</em> and a <em>factual consequence of what will happen</em>. I&apos;m claiming that if you do negative visualization, it will make you more appreciative. I&apos;m not claiming that you <em>should </em>do negative visualization <em>because </em>it will make you more appreciative. </p><p>2.5ly, imagining the events going badly might trigger <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/d922gAtBM8JNzkKKJ/p/zZkMm6ySRJKhHJHfq"">murphyjitsu</a> - you might think of a way to make it better.

<h1>Background &amp; motivation</h1>
<p>I'm interested in helping ensure a good post-AGI future. But how do we think concretely about AGI, when AGI doesn't exist and we don't know how to build it? Three paths:</p>
<ol>
<li>We can think generally about the nature of intelligence and agency—a research program famously associated with MIRI, Marcus Hutter, etc.;</li>
<li>We can think about today's AI systems—a research program famously associated with OpenAI, DeepMind, CHAI, etc.;</li>
<li>We can start from the one ""general intelligence"" we know about, i.e. the human brain, and try to go from there to lessons about how AGI might be built, what it might look like, and how it might be safely and beneficially used and controlled.</li>

Also, this program will be <em>especially</em> important if we build AGI in part by reverse-engineering (or reinventing) high-level neocortical algorithms, which (as discussed below) I think is very plausible, maybe even likely—for better or worse.</p>
<p>Now, the brain is divided into the neocortex and the subcortex.</p>
<p>Start with the <strong>neocortex</strong><sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-hFo52f2uxCkWqKXXC-2"" id=""fnref-hFo52f2uxCkWqKXXC-2"">[2]</a></sup> The neocortex does essentially all the cool exciting intelligent things that humans do, like building an intelligent world-model involving composition and hierarchies and counterfactuals and analogies and meta-cognition etc., and using that thing to cure diseases and build rocket ships and create culture etc. Thus, both neuroscientists and AI researchers focus a lot of attention onto the neocortex, and on understanding and reverse-engineering its algorithms. Textbooks divide the neocortex into lots of functional regions like ""motor cortex"" and ""visual cortex"" and ""frontal lobe"" etc., but microscopically it's all a pretty uniform 6-layer structure, and I currently believe that all parts of the neocortex are performing more-or-less the same algorithm, but with different input and output connections. These connections are seeded by an innate gross wiring diagram and then edited by the algorithm itself. See <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NkSpukDkm9pjRdMdB/human-instincts-symbol-grounding-and-the-blank-slate"">Human Instincts, Symbol Grounding, and the Blank-Slate Neocortex</a> for discussion and (heavy!) caveats on that claim. And what is this algorithm? I outline some of (what I think are) the high-level specifications at <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/cfvBm2kBtFTgxBB7s/predictive-coding-rl-sl-bayes-mpc"">Predictive coding = RL + SL + Bayes + MPC</a>. In terms of how the algorithm actually works, I think that researchers are making fast progress towards figuring this out, and that a complete answer is already starting to crystallize into view on the horizon. For a crash course on what's known today on how the neocortex does its thing, maybe a good starting point would be to read <a href=""https://smile.amazon.com/dp/0805078533/ref=cm_sw_r_em_apa_i_BrhIEbHYFKJ42""><em>On Intelligence</em></a> and then every paper ever written by Dileep George (and citations therein).</p>
<p><strong>The subcortex</strong>, by contrast, is <em>not</em> a single configuration of neurons tiled over a huge volume, but rather it is a collection of quite diverse structures like the amygdala, cerebellum, tectum, and so on. Unlike the neocortex, this stuff does <em>not</em> perform some miraculous computation light-years beyond today's technology; as far as I can tell, it accomplishes the same sorts of things as AlphaStar does. And the most important thing to understand (for AGI safety) is this:</p>
<p><em><strong>The subcortex provides the training signals that guide the neocortex to do biologically-useful things.<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-hFo52f2uxCkWqKXXC-3"" id=""fnref-hFo52f2uxCkWqKXXC-3"">[3]</a></sup></strong></em></p>
<p>Now, if people build AGI that uses algorithms similar to the neocortex, we will need to provide it with training signals. What exactly are these training signals? What <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/SJXujr5a2NcoFebr4/mesa-optimizers-vs-steered-optimizers"">inner alignment</a> issues might they present? Suppose we wanted to make an AGI that was pro-social <em>for the same underlying reason</em> as humans are (sometimes) pro-social (i.e., thanks to the same computation); is that possible, how would we do it, and would it work reliably? These are questions we should answer well before we finish reverse-engineering the neocortex. I mean, really these questions should have been answered before we even <em>started</em> reverse-engineering the neocortex!! I don't have answers to those questions, but I'm trying to lay groundwork in that direction. Better late than never…</p>
<p>(<strong>Update 1 year later:</strong> These days I say ""hypothalamus &amp; brainstem"" instead of subcortex, and I'm inclined to lump almost the entire rest of the brain—the whole telencephalon plus cerebellum—in with the neocortex as the subsystem implementing a from-scratch learning algorithm. See <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/jrewt3rLFiKWrKuyZ/big-picture-of-phasic-dopamine"">here</a>)</p>
<h1>Things to keep in mind</h1>
<p>Before we get into the weeds, here are some additional mental pictures we'll need going forward:</p>
<h2>Simple example: Fear of spiders</h2>
<p>My go-to example for the relation between subcortex and neocortex is fear of spiders.<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-hFo52f2uxCkWqKXXC-4"" id=""fnref-hFo52f2uxCkWqKXXC-4"">[4]</a></sup> Besides the visual cortex, humans have a little-known <em>second</em> vision system in the midbrain (superior colliculus). When you see a black scuttling thing in your field of view, the midbrain vision system detects that and sends out a reaction that makes us look in that direction and increase our heart rate and flinch away from it. Meanwhile, the neocortex is simultaneously seeing the spider with <em>its</em> vision system, <em>and</em> it's seeing the hormones and bodily reaction going on, and it connects the dots to learn that ""spiders are scary"". In the future, if the neocortex merely imagines a spider, it might cause your heart to race and body to flinch. On the other hand, after <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_therapy"">exposure therapy</a>, we might be able to remain calm when imagining or even seeing a spider. How does all this work?</p>
<p>(Note again the different capabilities of the midbrain and neocortex: The midbrain has circuitry to recognize black scuttling things—kinda like today's CNNs can—whereas the neocortex is able to construct and use a rich semantic category like ""spiders"".)</p>
<p>We'll be returning to this example over and over in the post, trying to work through how it might be implemented and what the consequences are.</p>
<h2>The neocortex is a black box from the perspective of the subcortex</h2>
<p>The neocortex's algorithm, as I understand it, sorta learns patterns, and patterns in the patterns, etc., and each pattern is represented as an essentially randomly-generated<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-hFo52f2uxCkWqKXXC-5"" id=""fnref-hFo52f2uxCkWqKXXC-5"">[5]</a></sup> set of neurons in the neocortex. So, if X is a concept in your neocortical world-model, there is no straightforward way for an innate instinct to refer directly to X—say, by wiring axons from the neurons representing X to the reward center—because X's neurons are not at predetermined locations. X is inside the black box. An instinct can incentivize X, at least to some extent, but it has to be done indirectly.</p>
<p>I made a list of various ways that we can have universal instincts despite the neocortex being a black-box learning algorithm: See <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NkSpukDkm9pjRdMdB/human-instincts-symbol-grounding-and-the-blank-slate"">Human Instincts, Symbol Grounding, and the Blank-Slate Neocortex</a> for my list.</p>
<p>This blog post is a much deeper dive into how a couple of these mechanisms might be actually implemented.</p>
<h1>General picture</h1>
<p>Finally, here is the current picture in my head:</p>
<p><img src=""https://sjbyrnes.com/LW_InnerAlignmentBrain.png"" alt=""""></p>
<p>(<strong>Update 1 year later:</strong> I no longer would draw it this way—see <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/jrewt3rLFiKWrKuyZ/big-picture-of-phasic-dopamine"">Big picture of phasic dopamine</a> for what I now think instead. The main difference is: I would <em>not</em> draw a direct line from neocortex to a hormone change (for example); instead the cortex would tell the subcortex (hypothalamus + brainstem) to make that hormone change, and then the subcortex might or might not comply with that recommendation. (I guess the way I drew it here is more like <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic_marker_hypothesis"">somatic marker hypothesis</a>.))</p>
<p>There’s a lot here. Let's go through it bit by bit.</p>
<h1>Emotions, ""emotion concepts"", and ""reactions""</h1>
<p>One aspect of this picture is emotions. There's a school of thought, popularized by Paul Ekman and the movie <em>Inside Out</em>, that there are exactly six emotions (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise), each with its own universal facial expression. (I've seen other lists of emotions too, and sometimes there's also a list of social emotions like embarrassment, jealousy, guilt, shame, pride, etc.) That was my belief too, until I read the book <a href=""https://smile.amazon.com/How-Emotions-Made-Lisa-Barrett/dp/1328915433/""><em>How Emotions Are Made</em> by Lisa Feldman Barrett</a>, which convincingly argues against it. Barrett argues that a word like ""anger"" lumps together a lot of very different bodily responses involving different facial expressions, hormones, etc. Basically, emotional concepts, like other concepts, are arbitrary categories describing things that we find useful to lump together. Sure, they might be lumped together because they share a common hormone change or a common facial expression, but they might just as likely be lumped together because they share a common situational context, or a common set of associated social norms, or whatever else. And an emotion concept with an English-language name like ""anger"" is not fundamentally different from an idiosyncratic emotion concept like ""How Alice must have felt in that TV episode where..."".</p>
<p>(Incidentally, while I think Barrett's book is right about that, I am definitely not blanket-endorsing the whole book—there are a lot of other claims in it that I don't agree with, or perhaps don't understand.<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-hFo52f2uxCkWqKXXC-6"" id=""fnref-hFo52f2uxCkWqKXXC-6"">[6]</a></sup> I think Barrett would strongly disagree with most of this blog post, though I could be wrong.)</p>
<p>So instead of putting ""emotions"" in the subcortex, I instead put there a bunch of things I'm calling ""reactions"" for clarity.<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-hFo52f2uxCkWqKXXC-7"" id=""fnref-hFo52f2uxCkWqKXXC-7"">[7]</a></sup> I imagine that there are dozens to hundreds of these (...and separating them into a discrete list is probably an oversimplification of a more complicated computational architecture, but I will anyway). There's the reaction that gets triggered when your midbrain vision system sees a spider moving towards you out of the corner of your eye, as discussed above. And there's a different reaction that gets triggered when you stand at the edge of a precipice and peer over the edge. Both of those reactions might be categorized as ""fear"" in the neocortex, but they're really different reactions, involving (I presume) different changes to heart rate, different bodily motions, different facial expressions, different quantities of (negative) reward, etc. (Reactions where peripheral vision is helpful will summon a wide-eyed facial expression; reactions where visual acuity is helpful will summon a narrow-eyed facial expression; and so on.)</p>
<p>As described above for the spider example, the neocortex can see what the subcortex does to our hormones, body, face, etc., and it can learn to predict that, and build those expectations into its predictive world-model, and create concepts around that.</p>
<p>(I also put ""pain concept"" in the neocortex, again following Barrett. A giant part of the pain concept is nociception—detecting the incoming nerve signals we might call ""pain sensations"". But at the end of the day, the neocortex gets to decide whether or not to classify a situation as ""pain"", based on not only nociception but also things like context and valence.)</p>
<h1>The neocortex's non-motor outputs</h1>
<p>From the above, our neocortex comes to expect that if we see a scuttling spider out of the corner of our eye, our heart will race and we'll turn towards it and flinch away. What's missing from this picture? The neocortex <em>causing</em> our heart to race by <em>anticipating</em> a spider. It's easy to see why this would be evolutionarily useful: If I know (with my neocortex) that a poisonous spider is approaching, it's appropriate for my heart to start racing even before my midbrain sees the black scuttling blob.</p>
<p>Now we're at the top-left arrow in the diagram above: the neocortex causing (in this case) release of stress hormones. How does the neocortex learn to do that?</p>
<p>There are two parts of this ""how"" question: (1) what are the actual output knobs that the neocortex can use, and (2) how does the neocortex decide to use them? For (1), I have no idea. For the purpose of this blog post, let us assume that there is a set of outgoing axons from the neocortex that (directly or indirectly) cause hormone release, and also assume that ""hormone release"" is the right thing to be talking about in terms of controlling valence, arousal, and so on. I have very low confidence in all this, but I don't <em>think</em> it matters much for what I want to say in this post. (Update 1 year later: I understand (1) better now, but it still doesn't matter here.)</p>
<p>I mainly want to discuss question (2): given these output knobs, how does the neocortex decide to use them?</p>
<p>Recall again that in predictive coding, the neocortex <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/cfvBm2kBtFTgxBB7s/predictive-coding-rl-sl-bayes-mpc"">finds generative models which are consistent with each other, which have not been repeatedly falsified, and which predict that reward will happen</a>.</p>
<p>My first thought was: No additional ingredients, beyond that normal predictive coding picture,   are needed to get the neocortex to imitate the subcortical hormone outputs. Remember, just like my post on <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/isDCEmYHsosyAjLRK/predictive-coding-and-motor-control"">predictive coding and motor control</a>, the neocortex will discover and store generative models that entail “self-fulfilling prophecies”, where a single generative model in the neocortex simultaneously codes for a prediction of stress hormone <em>and</em> the neocortical output signals that actually cause the release of this stress hormone. Thus (...I initially thought...), after seeing spiders and stress hormones a few times, the neocortex will predict stress hormones when it sees a spider, which incidentally <em>creates</em> stress hormones.</p>
<p>But I don’t think that’s the right answer, at least not by itself. After all, the neocortex will <em>also</em> learn a generative model where stress hormone is generated exogenously (e.g. by the subcortical spider reaction) and where the neocortex’s own stress hormone generation knob is left untouched. This latter model is issuing perfectly good predictions, so there is no reason that the neocortex would spontaneously throw it out and start using instead the self-fulfilling-prophecy model. (By the same token, in the <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/isDCEmYHsosyAjLRK/predictive-coding-and-motor-control"">motor control case</a>, if I think you are going to take my limp arm and lift it up, I have no problem predicting that my arm will move due to that exogenous force; my neocortex doesn’t get confused and start issuing motor commands.)</p>
<p>So here's my second, better story:</p>
<p><em><strong>Reward criterion (one among many): when the subcortex calls for a reaction (e.g. cortisol release, eyes widening, etc.), it rewards the neocortex with dopamine if it sees that those commands have somehow already been issued.</strong></em></p>
<p>(Update 2021/06: Oops, that was wrong too. I think I got it on the third try though; see <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/wcNEXDHowiWkRxDNv/inner-alignment-in-salt-starved-rats"">here</a>.)</p>
<p>So if the subcortex computes that a situation calls for cortisol, the neocortex is rewarded if the subcortex sees that cortisol is <em>already</em> flowing. This example seems introspectively reasonable: Seeing a spider out of the corner of your eye is bad, but being <em>surprised</em> to see a spider when you were feeling safe and relaxed is even worse (worse in terms of dopamine, not necessarily worse in terms of valence—remember <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yDRX2fdkm3HqfTpav/approving-reinforces-low-effort-behaviors"">wanting ≠ liking</a>). Presumably the same principle can apply to eye-widening and other things.</p>
<p>To be clear, this is one reward criterion among many—the subcortex issues positive and negative rewards according to other criteria too (as in the diagram above, I think different reactions inherently issue positive or negative rewards to the neocortex, just like they inherently issue motor commands and hormone commands). But as long as this ""reward criterion"" above is permanently in place, then thanks to the laws of the <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/cfvBm2kBtFTgxBB7s/predictive-coding-rl-sl-bayes-mpc"">neocortex's generative model economy</a>, the neocortex will drop those generative models that passively anticipate the subcortex's reactions, in favor of models that actively anticipate / imitate the subcortical reactions, insofar as that's possible (the neocortex doesn't have output knobs for everything).</p>
<h2>Predicting, imagining, remembering, empathizing</h2>
<p>The neocortex’s generative models appear in the context of (1) prediction (including predicting the immediate future as it happens), (2) imagination, (3) memory, and (4) empathetic simulation (when we imagine <em>someone else</em> reacting to a spider, predicting a spider, etc.). I think all four of these processes rely on fundamentally the same mechanism in the neocortex, so by default the same generative models will be used for all four.  Thus, we get the same hormone outputs in all four of these situations.</p>
<p>Hang on, you say: That doesn’t seem right! If it were the <em>exact</em> same generative models, then when we remember dancing, we would actually issue the motor commands to start dancing! Well, I answer, we <em>do</em> actually sometimes move a little bit when we remember a motion! I think the rule is, loosely speaking, the top-down information flow is much stronger (more confident) when predicting, and much weaker for imagination, memory, and empathy. Thus, the neocortical output signals are weaker too, and this applies to both motor control outputs and hormone outputs. (Incidentally, I think motor control outputs are further subject to thresholding processes, downstream of the neocortex, and therefore a sufficiently weak motor command causes no motion at all.)</p>
<p>As discussed more below, the subcortex relies on the neocortex’s outputs to guess what the neocortex is thinking about, and issue evolutionarily-appropriate guidance in response. Presumably, to do this job well, the subcortex needs to know whether a given neocortical output is part of a prediction, or memory, or imagination, or empathetic simulation. From the above paragraph, I think it can distinguish predictions from the other three by the neocortical output strength. But how does it tell memory, imagination, and empathetic simulation apart from each other? I don’t know! Then that suggests to me an interesting hypothesis: maybe it <em>can’t</em>! What if some of our weirder instincts related to memory or counterfactual imagination are not adaptive at all, but rather crosstalk from social instincts, or vice-versa? For example, I think there’s a reaction in the subcortex that listens for a strong prediction of lower reward, alternating with a weak prediction of higher reward; when it sees this combination, it issues negative reward and negative valence. Think about what this subcortical reaction would do in the three different cases: If the weak prediction it sees is an empathetic simulation, well, that’s the core of jealousy! If the weak prediction it sees is a memory, well, that’s the core of loss aversion! If the weak prediction it sees is a counterfactual imagination, well, that’s the core of, I guess, that annoying feeling of having missed out on something good. Seems to fit together pretty well, right? I’m not super confident, but at least it’s food for thought.</p>
<h1>Various implications</h1>
<h2>Opening a window into the black-box neocortex</h2>
<p>Each subcortical reaction has its own profile of facial, body, and hormone changes. The ""reward criterion"" above ensures that the neocortex will learn to imitate the characteristic consequences of reaction X whenever it is expecting, imagining, remembering, or empathetically simulating reaction X. This is then a window for the subcortex to get a glimpse into the goings-on inside the black-box neocortex.</p>
<p>In our running example, if the spider reaction creates a certain combination of facial, body, and hormone changes, then the subcortex can watch for this set of changes to happen exogenously (from its perspective), and if it does, the subcortex can infer that the neocortex was maybe thinking about spiders. Perhaps the subcortex might then issue its own spider reaction, fleshing out the neocortex's weak imitation. Or perhaps it could do something entirely different.</p>
<p>I have a hunch that social emotions rely on this. With this mechanism, it seems that the subcortex can build a hierarchy of increasingly complicated social reactions: ""if I'm activating reaction A, and I think you're activating reaction B, then that triggers me to feel reaction C"", ""if I'm activating reaction C, and I think you're activating reaction A, then that triggers me to feel reaction D"", and so on. Well, maybe. I'm still hazy on the details here and want to think about it more.</p>
<h2>Complex back-and-forth between neocortex and subcortex</h2>
<p>The neocortex can alter the hormones and body, which are among the inputs into the subcortical circuits. The subcortical circuits then also alter the hormones and body, which are among the inputs into the neocortex! Around and around it goes! So for example, if you tell yourself to calm down, your neocortex changes your hormones, which in turn increases the activation of the subcortical ""I am safe and calm"" reaction, which reinforces and augments that change, which in turn makes it easier for the neocortex to continue feeling safe and calm! … Until, of course, that pleasant cycle is broken by other subcortical reactions <em>or</em> other neocortical generative models butting in.</p>
<h1>""Overcoming"" subcortical reactions</h1>
<p>Empirically, we know it's possible to ""overcome"" fear of spiders, and other subcortical reactions. I'm thinking there are two ways this might work. I think both are happening, but I’m not really sure.</p>
<p>First, there's subcortical learning … well, ""learning"" isn't the right word here, because it's not trying to match some ground truth. (The only ""ground truth"" for subcortical reaction specifications is natural selection!) I think it's more akin to the <a href=""https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-for-a-program-to-modify-its-own-code/answer/Anders-Kaseorg"">self-modifying code in Linux</a> than to the weight updates in ML. So let's call it <strong>subcortical input-dependent dynamic rewiring rules</strong>.</p>
<p>(By the way, elsewhere in the subcortex, like the cerebellum, there is <em>also</em> real stereotypical “learning” going on, akin to the weight updates in ML. That does happen, but it’s not what I’m talking about here. In fact, I prefer to lump the cerebellum in with the neocortex as the learning-algorithm part of the brain.)</p>
<p>Maybe one subcortical dynamic rewiring rule says: <em>If the spider-detection reaction triggers, and then within 3 seconds the ""I am safe and calm"" reaction triggers, then next time the spider reaction should trigger more weakly.</em></p>
<p>Second, there’s neocortical learning—i.e., the neocortex developing new generative models. Let's say again that we're doing exposure therapy for fear of spiders, and let's say the two relevant subcortical reactions are the spider-detection reaction (which rewards the neocortex for producing anxiety hormones before it triggers) and the ""I am safe and calm"" reaction (which rewards the neocortex for for producing calming hormones before <em>it</em> triggers). (I'm obviously oversimplifying here.) The neocortex could learn generative models that summon the “I am safe and calm” reaction whenever the spider-detection reaction is just starting to trigger. That generative model could potentially get entrenched and rewarded, as the spider-detection reaction is sorta preempted and thus can’t issue a penalty for the lack of anxiety hormones, whereas the “I am safe and calm” reaction <em>does</em> issue a reward for the presence of calm hormones. Something like that?</p>
<p>I have no doubt that the second of these two processes—neocortical learning—really happens. The first might or might not happen, I don’t know. It does seem like something that plausibly could happen, on both evolutionary and neurological grounds. So I guess my default assumption is that dynamic rewiring rules for subcortical reactions do in fact exist, but again, I’m not sure, I haven't thought about it much.</p>
<h1>Things I still don't understand</h1>
<p>I lumped together the subcortex into a monolithic unit. I actually understand very little about the functional decomposition beyond that. The tectum and tegmentum seem to be doing a lot of the calculations for what I'm calling ""reactions"", including the colliculi, which seem to house the subcortical sensory processing. What computations does the amygdala do, for example? It has 10 million neurons, they have to be calculating something!!! I really don't know. (Update 1 year later: On the plus side, I feel like I understand the amygdala much better now; on the minus side, I was wrong to lump it in with ""subcortex"" rather than ""neocortex"". <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/jrewt3rLFiKWrKuyZ/big-picture-of-phasic-dopamine"">See discussion here</a>.)</p>
<p>As discussed above, I don't understand what the non-motor output signals from the neocortex are (update: see <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/jrewt3rLFiKWrKuyZ/big-picture-of-phasic-dopamine"">here</a>), or whether things like valence and arousal correspond to hormones or something else. (Update: attempt to understand valence <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/TtBik82RQLBCG3h8j/emotional-valence-vs-rl-reward-a-video-game-analogy"">here</a>.)</p>
<p>I'm more generally uncertain about everything I wrote here, even where I used a confident tone. Honestly, I haven't found much in the systems neuroscience literature that's addressing the questions I'm interested in, although I imagine it's there somewhere and I'm reinventing lots of wheels (or re-making classic mistakes). As always, please let me know any thoughts, ideas, things you find confusing, etc. Thanks in advance!</p>

It didn't work; nothing happened. But I think they did the experiment wrong—I think it has to be a video of a moving spider, not a stationary picture of a spider, to trigger the subcortical circuitry. (Source: introspection. Also, I think I read that the subcortical vision system has pretty low spatial resolution, so watching for a characteristic motion would seem a sensible design.)

The probability of it seems hard to estimate, but it should nevertheless be attempted, because the stakes are so high.</p><h2>Uncertainty</h2><p>Covid seems to leave permanent lung damage even in young people. Let&apos;s say you are 30, get the disease now and recover. Say the vaccine does not get developed, the disease stays with us and you get it again in a few years. Now it&apos;s going it be worse. It still may not kill you. Let&apos;s say that no effective antivirals get developed which can help you. In a few years you get it again, and this straw breaks the camel&apos;s back, now you&apos;re dead.</p><p>The virus apparently has a mutation rate which is on the high end, unexpectedly large rate of mutation. This makes the vaccine less probable. How much less? No idea.</p><p>Some say that antivirals &quot;look promising&quot; but what does that actually mean? No idea. What are they going to cost? What is the theoretical maximum which could be produced on this planet? No idea.</p><p>As someone who is not an expert in medicine/biology, every estimate I attempt is going to have a large entropy. Information about this disease we got from various institutions in the past few months was highly biased, because of their incentives. What are the incentives of the people who claim that antivirals look promising? Are the companies just trying to make their product look better, in order to increase the funding provided to them?</p><p>The fact that I don&apos;t have a clear picture on this bothers me... Where to even get info on this? Are people talking about it but I&apos;m not aware of it? Please, if you have an opinion, leave your subjective probability estimate in the comments, along with the reasoning behind it.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>The apocalyptic scenario would surely have huge impact on society. The totalitarian regimes would perhaps deal with this better than free ones, which would either tip the balance of power in favour of China, or it would offer an incentive for the free regimes to turn totalitarian. Even without totalitarianism, a large percentage of the population dying means a lot of people at critical positions (e.g. nuclear power plant engineers) would need to be replaced fast. Also, it means a lot of people at head positions in various organizations would need to be replaced. Will they be replaced successfully?</p><p>I hope there is a research group somewhere which is investing, or plans to invest, at least 100 man-hours into investigating the worst-case scenario and estimating the probability of it.</p>",roko-jelavic,roko-jelavic,Roko Jelavić,

Lewis seem to have the ability to express cliches in ways that don&apos;t feel cliched.</p><blockquote>Jordan Peterson&#x2019;s superpower is saying cliches and having them sound meaningful. There are times &#x2013; like when I have a desperate and grieving patient in front of me &#x2013; that I would give almost anything for this talent. &#x201C;You know that she wouldn&#x2019;t have wanted you to be unhappy.&#x201D; &#x201C;Oh my God, you&#x2019;re right! I&#x2019;m wasting my life grieving when I could be helping others and making her proud of me, let me go out and do this right now!&#x201D; If only.</blockquote><p>This seems like an undervalued skill, particularly within the rationalist community where the focus tends to be on the new and flashy and exciting.</p><p>This may sound absurd, but I see it as entirely possible that there may be more wisdom in what we already know than what we don&apos;t know and that we just need to learn to extract it. After all, we should expect that almost all the low hanging fruit has been picked by someone in at some point and that if it is broadly applicable, that it&apos;d spread. But if that&apos;s too strong, perhaps it might be true after someone has read a few personal development books and spent a few hours on understanding a couple of different religions. In any case, this theory seems worthy of attention as if it were true, then the consequences regarding how we should go about self-development would be truly momentous.</p><p>So if platitudes contain deep wisdom, why are they so often derided? Is it that everyone already knows them and so hearing them for the thousandth time is a waste?</p><p>I think it is related to <a href=""https://medium.com/@ThingMaker/idea-inoculation-inferential-distance-848836a07a5b"">idea inoculation</a>. If you are convinced that you already know a concept but your understanding is incomplete then it becomes almost impossible to teach you.</p><p>There are many reasons why cliches fail to land:</p><ul><li>Cliches are favoured by unoriginal thinkers who can&apos;t think their own thoughts. The low intellectual status of these thinkers attaches to these cliches</li><li>Someone who repeats a cliche demonstrates a low social awareness and this low social status attaches to the cliche</li><li>Unoriginal thinkers and people with low social awareness are less likely to express these thoughts in ways that are either original or which are persuasive</li><li>Once something is derided as a cliche there is social pressure to dismiss it</li><li>Many cliches can only be understood with life experience and when people first encounter them they are likely to lack this experience</li><li>When platitudes become a common response, people are likely to use them in a careless or insincere manner</li><li>People have an incentive to dismiss platitudes as a way of signalling their greater intelligence and social awareness</li><li>Even if someone does find a way of expressing a platitude in a way that gets around people&apos;s <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/2MD3NMLBPCqPfnfre/cached-thoughts"">caches</a>, it is very hard for listeners to transmit this to other people since this is usually dependent on communicating this in a very particular way. So these original expressions are unlikely to spread far enough to replace the general understanding of an idea as cliched</li></ul><p>Being able to communicate old ideas in a way such that they seem original is an incredibly valuable skill and one worth developing further.</p>",Ouroborus,ouroborus,Ouroborus,

We rushed it out quickly to give people a way to manage the deluge of Covid-19 posts which had grown to 50% of new posts by mid-March.</p><p>Now we’re ready to trial the tag system generally with all kinds of tags. With this launch people can now 1) use tag pages to find posts about their interests, and 2) filter their Latest Posts section on the frontpage for the content they’re most interested in. Soon tag filtering will applicable to Recent Discussion and All Posts page, as well as it being possible to subscribe to tags.</p><h1>How experimental is this?</h1><p><strong>Very. </strong>The team is figuring out all kinds of questions related to tag ontology and tagging UI, and it’s all subject to change. <strong>We’d greatly appreciate feedback and user interviews (comment on this post or use the </strong><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/j3m36wSTiDkDFioD7/lw-team-updates-pandemic-edition-march-2020#Feedback__Support__Questions__Etc_""><strong><u>usual channels</u></strong></a><strong>!)</strong></p><p><strong>Warning!</strong> For the next while, if you help us by tagging posts or voting on tag relevance, it’s possible you will lose your effort if we later decide to delete the tag due to our evolving tag policy.

I've recently become a fan of wired headsets for video calls for two
reasons: headsets are good at keeping out background noise, and wired
is good for minimizing latency.

</span>

</p><p>

When I started working from home I would need to constantly mute and
unmute myself on video calls.  I'm working from my bedroom, which is
near the kids bedroom's and their playing can be (intermittently)
loud.  I would leave myself muted except to talk, but needing to
remember to unmute was annoying, and occasionally they would be being
loud when I needed to say something.  A headset with a boom mic (Jabra
Evolve 40, <a href=""https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-usb-office-headset/"">via
the Wirecutter</a>) helped enormously.  The kids can be shouting in
the same room as me, and it essentially won't pick it up.  For example,
here's audio of me speaking.  When wearing the headset it's easily
audible, while if I speak even 1ft from the headset it's barely
audible (24dB quieter) and at 5ft it's an enormous 37dB quieter:

</p>

<p>

</p>

</tr>
</table>



<p>

Similarly, I took a recording of me speaking and then closing my
bedroom door, with the headset on vs with my laptop mic.  The peak of
the door closing is 28dB higher with the laptop mic:

Combined with the automatic gate in most video call software, I can
just leave my mic on all the time and talk frictionlessly.

</p>

<p>

With headsets one important question is wired vs wireless.  With wired
you need to deal with a wire, while with wireless you have to deal
with charging, pairing, and higher latency.  After my
experience with <a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/ethernet-is-worth-it-for-video-calls"">setting up wired
internet</a> and realizing how much latency matters for feeling like
you're really in the same place, this seems like a major consideration
to me.  But Bluetooth headset specs don't mention it, and the
Wirecutter <a href=""https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-wireless-headset-for-the-office/"">doesn't
measure it or even discuss it</a>.  For gaming you can buy wireless
headsets that use <a href=""https://www.soundguys.com/best-wireless-gaming-headset-28701/"">custom
radio setups</a> so this does sound like enough of a problem that some
people care about it.  I found one site that 
<a href=""https://www.rtings.com/headphones/learn/sbc-aptx-which-bluetooth-codec-is-the-best"">ran
latency tests</a> and it looks like Bluetooth normally adds 
~150-200ms of latency but if you can get both sides of the connection to
understand the aptX codec in low-latency mode you can get it down to
~25ms.  Since we're talking about using a headset to participate in a
conversation then doubling these numbers sounds right.

</p>

<p>

My housemate lent me a <a href=""https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B0756CYWWD/"">Bose QC 35
II</a> headset for testing and I measured its latency with my MacBook
Pro.  I paired them over Bluetooth, and then measured how long it took
for a ping to go from my computer to the headphones, to the
microphone, and back to my computer.  Then I ran the same test with my
wired headset plugged into the MacBook's 3.5mm jack to compare.
Wireless added 325ms of round-trip latency:

</p>

<p>

I also tested the Mac's mic and speakers, and this was the same low
latency as the wired headset.

</p>

<p>

This means that if you switch from no headset to a bluetooth headset you
might improve background noise but pay for it in latency, and a wired
headset makes a lot more sense.

</p>

<p>

In general, I think people who want good video meetings should be
following the standard advice for lag-minimizing gamers and people who
deal with audio in noisy environments: wired everything, and put the
mic as close to the source as you can.

But there often are rational reasons to not act on those beliefs. Knowing those reasons is really important for those that don't have a natural defense mechanism.</p>
<p>Most people have a natural defense mechanism which is to not taking ideas seriously. If you just follow what others do, it's less likely that an error in your explicit reasoning will lead you to doing something radical and dangerous. The more likely you are to make such errors, the most (evolutionary and individually) advantageous it is for you to have a conformist instinct.</p>
<p>The answer to this question is mostly meant for people to which I want to share ideas that are dangerous if taken at face value / object-level (I want to make sure they have those defense mechanisms first; I encourage you do the same, and do your due diligences when discussing dangerous ideas; this post is not sufficient). I want to advocate to smart people to take ideas more seriously, but I don't want them to fully repress their conformist instincts, especially if they haven't built in explicit defense mechanisms. This post should also be useful for people already not having those defense mechanism. And also useful to people that want to better understand the function of conformity (although conformity is not the only defense mechanism).</p>
<p>Note that the defense mechanisms are not meant as <a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Fully_general_counterargument"">fully general counterargument</a>. They are not insurmontable (at least, not always), they just indicate when it's prudent to want more evidence.</p>
<p>As a small tangent, is also often has a positive externality to do exploration:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Like it’s rational for any individual to be pursuing much more heavily exploitation based strategy as long as someone somewhere else is creating the information and part of what I find kind of charming and counterintuitive about this is that you realize people who are very exploratory by nature are performing a public service.

<p>Declaring commitment to <a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Crocker's_rules"">Crocker's rules</a> means that other people can optimize their messages to you for information, disregarding our cultures normal rules against potentially causing offense. The reason why one might commit to said rules is to maximize growth - in order to change yourself, one must first acknowledge that you're currently insufficient, which is made easier if someone is allowed to tell you so.</p>
<p>However, being able to abstractly reason that accepting blunt criticism is good does not allow you to accept criticism. When someone directly critiques you, it <em>hurts</em>. For most people, blunt criticism is net negative because the emotional state it induces is not conducive to change. For some people, normal criticism is also net negative for the same reasons.</p>
<p>Deflinching is a technique that attempts to create space to listen to criticism and Lines of Retreat is a technique to create the mindset to accept it.</p>
<h1>Deflinching</h1>
<p>At its core, Deflinching is just a <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/d922gAtBM8JNzkKKJ/p/ywWH2zRL39v3KEvHM"">TAP</a>. It goes like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Trigger: <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/d922gAtBM8JNzkKKJ/p/2n83uRi36KWDC9LyK"">notice</a> that you're triggered/offended/bristling</li>
<li>Action: make space</li>
</ol>
<p>The heart of the technique lies in ""making space"". This is akin to a micro-<a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/d922gAtBM8JNzkKKJ/p/vHXe2f59bJHihvcBt"">focusing</a> move, where the goal is to determine what part of you got triggered/offended/bristly.</p>
<p>In general, there are <em>good reasons</em> for you to get offended. If someone I respect tells me I commited a social faux pas, the internal wince I experience is <em>real</em>. In my case, it's because I don't like being told that I hurt someone because I don't like hurting people. The temptation is to respond ""no, I didn't do that"" because I obviously didn't <em>intend</em> to hurt them. If there's something your instinctive reaction is trying to defend, you want to surface that thing. You don't want to squish it down and let it eek out the sides, but you don't want to let it dominate either.</p>
<p>The generalized temptation is to direct the wince-type-feeling back at the person who gave you the criticism. This is bad for a few reasons, but one of the main reasons is that this negatively reinforces people giving you criticism, which means you stop finding out about possible improvements you can make. The point of ""making space"" is to figure out what the wince-type-feeling is actually directed at. In many cases, it's directed at the world state in which the criticism is true - in which case, don't kill the messenger. In other cases, it can be directed at the <em>form</em> of the message, as opposed to the contents.</p>
<p>In practice, the easiest way to ""make space"" is to pause for a few seconds (""easiest"" is relative; on an absolute scale, making space for criticism is <em>hard</em> ). There is a classic anger management technique that is to count to 10 whenever you get angry. The rationalist equivalent might be to recite the <a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Litany_of_Gendlin"">Litany of Gendlin</a>(or part of it). You could think of it as you already having a TAP that goes ""get criticised -&gt; react"" that you want to replace with ""get criticised -&gt; pause"".</p>
<h1>Lines of Retreat</h1>
<p>This is another <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/d922gAtBM8JNzkKKJ/p/ywWH2zRL39v3KEvHM"">TAP</a>. It goes like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Trigger: make space</li>
<li>Action: ask yourself ""what if the criticism is true?""</li>
</ol>
<p>If the criticism is true and you don't care, then you can just let it go. Sometimes people tell me that my shirt doesn't look very good. If it's not a shirt that I think looks good either, then I don't really care if they don't think it looks good - after all, they agree with me! There's a failure mode where you just pretend you ""don't care"" about a lot of criticism - if you've made space properly, this failure mode shouldn't happen, but it is still worth it to keep it in mind.</p>
<p>Most of the time, however, the reason that you got triggered/defensive is because you do care. If you have a particular sort of brain, realizing you care whether or not the criticism is true makes you curious to figure that out, which means you're now in an eagerly-listening-to-criticism mode, and you've succeeded. For most of us, however, the realization that you care is not enough.</p>
<p>The line of retreat is visualizing a world in which the criticism is true. What if I actually deeply offended my friend with a bad joke? What are the consequences? I would try and pass an <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/PH47N6uTdtbLAHrAr/the-ideological-turing-test"">ideological turing test</a> for why they were offended and apologize, explaining a strategy to not commit anything in the general class of offenses that that specific offense represented. This would be hard and take time, but overall probably not cause lasting damage to any of my relationships. It's bad, but not <em>that</em> bad. Making sure the criticism is not true isn't my final stand; I can always retreat to reality.</p>
<p>The point is to put yourself in a mental state where you are able to accept that the criticism might be true. This is a prerequisite to being able to learn/grow from accepting criticism.</p>
<p>The final step is to figure out whether or not the criticism is true. I have no advice for this step, except that it is probably going to be easier than the above.</p>
<h1>Exercise</h1>
<p>Find a friend and ask them to tell you <em>small</em> and <em>non-central</em> flaws about yourself. <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/d922gAtBM8JNzkKKJ/p/2n83uRi36KWDC9LyK"">Notice</a> the feeling of triggeredness/defensiveness/bristlyness. Imagine a world in which you actually have those flaws and ask yourself how bad it is.</p>
<p>If desired, repeat with flaws that escalate in size (be careful you're <em>actually ready</em> for this, and not just eager to show you're a Real Rationalist<span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""^{TM}""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char""></span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sup"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: 0.513em; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-texatom"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.12em;"">T</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.081em;"">M</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>).</p>

</style></head><body><p><em>This is a stub of an argument that I don't necessarily agree with, but that I think deserves to be thought about and analysed more</em>.</p>
<p>Why would we expand into the solar system? What's the actual point - what would we get out there?</p>
<p>I'll argue here that there may not be good economic reasons to go to space; therefore space colonisation would be driven by non-economic reasons, which suggests a different pattern of expansion.</p>
<h1>The revenues of space</h1>
<p><img src=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/tub83vzm6bihg01/Space-Mining-Image-1.jpg?raw=1"" alt=""""></p>
<h2>Mining</h2>
<p>How could we make money in space? The obvious answer is mining. Asteroids and planets are full of resources, carbon, iron, gold, rare earths, and so on; the value of these resources, at current prices, is staggering.</p>
<p>But note ""at current prices"". Obviously, if we brought down a few trillions of tons of copper, the price of that metal might suffer a <em>slight</em> dip.</p>
<p>So what's the economic value of current mining? Well, mining represented <a href=""https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13563-019-00191-6""><span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""1.2 \%""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mn""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">1.2</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">%</span></span></span></span></span></span> of world GDP in 2016</a>; but roughly <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""50\%""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mn""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">50</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">%</span></span></span></span></span></span> of this is coal, which is mainly used for energy (we'll get to that later). This is a small fraction of the current economy, and one that is in decline (over the century span, if not the decade span).</p>
<p>The attraction of space mining is that we have access to immense resources; but what we need is access to resources at a cheap marginal cost. If space mining doesn't offer that, then we just won't use it, just as there are ways of getting resources on Earth (eg some forms of recycling, distilling resources from the sea, very deep mining) that we are just not using because they're currently too expensive.</p>
<p>Or, put another way, if you're thirsty, the glass of water a metre away is of more interest than the vast reservoir just over the mountain range.</p>
<h2>Other revenue generators</h2>
<p>There are other things we can do in space. Some scientific experiments require micro-gravity; we can <a href=""http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/intergalactic-spreading.pdf"">harvest energy</a> via solar panels in space; new manufacturing methods may be usable in zero-G.</p>
<p>But these things can be done in near-Earth orbit, on some nearby space station, or on the moon if we really need some gravity or some mining. Deeper space seems to have little economic advantage. Is it any easier to design AI in space versus doing it on Earth?</p>
<h2>The incidental economics of a colony</h2>
<p>It's possible to do some agriculture is space; solar energy collection can be done almost anywhere; water is a useful resource for a colony, and, of course, once you have a colony anyway, shipping resources back might be relatively cheap.</p>
<p>But these are all things that make a space colony ""not quite as expensive"". They are not reasons to have a space colony in the first place. In no sane world would it be cheaper to do agriculture in deeper space and ship that to Earth, as opposed to doing that on Earth or in near-Earth orbit - the technologies that allow the first also help the others.</p>
<h1>Why we <strong>would</strong> go to space</h1>
<p><img src=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/5bzp4ns9thuxonz/01orbit-articleLarge.jpg?raw=1"" alt=""""></p>
<p>This doesn't mean that we won't go to space. We might go there for exploration; for military reasons; for tourism; for prestige; for escape. And <em>once there are</em> space colonies, they may become self-sustaining, and have trade with Earth. But resource economics is not why we'll go there in the first place.</p>
<p>And a military/exploration/tourism/prestige/escape expansion into the solar system will look <strong>very</strong> different from an economics driven one, and would be far less predictable.</p>

Suppose we have a whole bunch of earthquake-sensors in an area, and one of them drops offline; this does not significantly inhibit our ability to detect earthquakes in the area. In this case, each individual sensor contains information on its own - there’s even redundant information across sensors, since they’re all presumably highly correlated.</p><p>We have two prototypical pictures here: one in which information is stored in the relationship between variables, and another in which information is stored in the variables themselves. Intuitively, information stored in relationships seems to be much more sensitive to noise - uncertainty in even just one variable can wipe out the signal from all the others. Thus, a hypothesis: in a large complex system, with lots of noisy unobserved variables mediating observable interactions, information stored in many-variable relationships tends to be wiped out.</p><p>I’ll call information stored in relationships “distributed information”. We can re-state our hypothesis as: in a complex system, noise tends to wipe out many-variable distributed information. (In an earlier draft, I called it “entanglement information” in analogy to quantum; this produces the familiar-sounding-to-physicists hypothesis that “noise tends to wipe out many-variable entanglement”.)</p><h2>A Measure of Distributed Information</h2><p>In order to formalize this idea, we first need an information-theoretic notion of “information stored in the relationship between variables”. Although the notion is qualitatively discussed in the context of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_mutual_information""><u>multivariate mutual information</u></a>, I have surprisingly not seen an actual formulation which separates distributed info from redundancy; multivariate mutual information just adds the two together.</p><p>After trying a few approaches, here’s what I’ve settled on.</p><p>We have variables&nbsp;<span><span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""X_1...X_n""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base"" style=""margin-right: -0.024em;""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.024em;"">X</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mn"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">1</span></span></span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""margin-top: -0.144em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">.</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space1""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""margin-top: -0.144em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">.</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space1""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""margin-top: -0.144em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">.</span></span><span class=""mjx-msubsup MJXc-space1""><span class=""mjx-base"" style=""margin-right: -0.024em;""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.024em;"">X</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mi"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">n</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span><span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""Y""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.182em;"">Y</span></span></span></span></span></span></span>; we want to talk about the information about&nbsp;<span><span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""Y""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.182em;"">Y</span></span></span></span></span></span></span>&nbsp;contained in&nbsp;<span><span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""X""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.024em;"">X</span></span></span></span></span></span></span>, i.e. the mutual information&nbsp;<span><span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""I(X; Y)""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.064em;"">I</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">(</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.024em;"">X</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.151em; padding-bottom: 0.519em;"">;</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi MJXc-space1""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.182em;"">Y</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">)</span></span></span></span></span></span></span>.

This only captures the biggest cluster of correlated variables (not any other clusters of perfectly-correlated variables), but looking at the output, the biggest component looks heavily dominant anyway. As we adjust the connection strength, we get this picture:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img style=""width:432%"" src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/CxEbvETK2WNfHw7v9/q3bnvisuzpmrudez8fol""></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>(200 variables from a 2000 variable system, p=0.05)</p><p>This looks like a classic phase transition: at low connection strength, everything varies approximately independently. As the connection strength increases, the system rapidly jumps to a state where most variables are near-perfectly correlated. (Physical examples of this sort of qualitative behavior include melting/freezing crystals, or magnetization of iron as we adjust the temperature.)</p><p>So this provides one idea of what “zero distributed information” behavior can look like. Most of our variables are near-completely uncorrelated in one regime, and near-perfectly correlated in another. In either case, any pair of variables is independent given any third variable.</p><p>Of course, this is still just scratching the surface of possible behaviors under zero distributed info. Next planned post will come at the problem from a different direction, and hopefully provide a stronger mathematical foundation for exploring what happens when models contain large numbers of unobserved variables.</p>",johnswentworth,johnswentworth,johnswentworth,

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Sometimes, it makes sense to view your life from a narrative lens - to pretend that you're the main character in a book of your favorite genre. From there, you can try and make guesses at what the plot might be. For some of you, there will actually be a plot - an ambition/mission/purpose that shines through you. For others, such a plot will be less obvious, <em>and that's ok</em>; remember, ""not all those who wander are lost.""</p>
<p>However, given that your life has a plot, you should take a moment to remember that you don't actually live in a book; there's no real reason why the plot can't just end at chapter two. This is a different problem - one that is tackled by other techniques.</p>
<p>The goal of <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/P5k3PGzebd5yYrYqd/the-hamming-question"">Hamming questions</a> is to figure out what the heart of your plot is - to find the biggest problems in your life, so you know which problems you need to solve.</p>
<h1>Warning</h1>
<p>By ancient literary tradition, all great magics require an equally great sacrifice. The power of hamming questions is to rapidly accelerate the course of your life, identifying key milestones and obstacles for you to confront. The cost is unique to each individual, but might include the pain of an accurate self-assessment, uncomfortable and difficult conversations, and the possibility of catastrophic failure.</p>
<p>This isn't a light warning. There are people who will have net-worse lives if they try to seriously answer certain hamming questions. If you find it extremely difficult to think of an answer, that's a sign you should stop looking - most of the time, people can't think certain thoughts for very good reasons.</p>
<p>The rule is that you should be able to do things that you're slightly uncomfortable with, but to <em>not force yourself to do things you don't want to do</em>. Be kind to your parts. Don't avoid <em>all</em> pain, but there is some threshold of pain that you should definitely avoid.</p>
<p>There's some meta-hazard where people might think that not being able/ready to answer hamming questions is a sign of weakness and then try to force themselves to answer. I'm not sure pointing out the meta-hazard resolves it, but I don't think it makes it worse.</p>
<h1>Hamming questions</h1>
<h2>Step one</h2>
<p>Sometimes, all of the problems in someone's life revolve around a single nexus. Sometimes, this is extremely obvious. Hence the first question: what's the biggest problem in your life? Why aren't you trying to solve it?</p>
<p>This problem might already be on your <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/d922gAtBM8JNzkKKJ/p/babweATFMT9jF6aX7"">bugs list</a> and you haven't realized it yet. There's a failure mode in which people treat ""solving life problems"" as the same, despite the vast differences in benefit from solving various problems.</p>
<p>For some people, this question is all there is. They have an answer, and now they know. Others must soldier onwards.</p>
<h2>Perfection is achieved</h2>
<p>Imagine that your life is perfect - that you're living in your personal utopia. Compare this to your current life. What can you do in your utopia that you can't do now? What do you have that you don't have now? What do you feel that you don't feel now?</p>
<p>Usually, this doesn't produce a clear problem. But it generally <em>points at</em> a class of possible problems. Adjusting the scale of how ""good"" your utopia is can allow you to pinpoint more precisely, as sometimes imagining a perfect life can make it difficult to identify what exactly you're currently missing because the only real answer is ""everything.""</p>
<p>The opposite problem also occurs - sometimes people's utopias are too shallow. If you think you might be one of these people, you should imagine that your life is beyond perfect - that you're as omniscient and omnipotent and omnibenevolent as you desire.</p>
<h2>Go meta</h2>
<p>As the saying goes, ""meta is betta"" quote me, right now. If there's no object level problem that immediately identifies itself, hop to a higher level. What's the reason why you can't instantly solve all your life problems? What resource on you most constrained on""</p>
<p>In chemistry, there are steps of a reaction that are rate limiting - the entire reaction proceeds at the speed of this step. What are the rate limiting steps in your life? How can you make these steps go faster?</p>
<p>Most resources can be traded for each other (usually with money as a lubricant). Can you sacrifice in areas that aren't rate limiting to speed up areas that are?</p>
<h2>Ask people</h2>
<p>There are things my friends think are obvious about me that I utterly failed to see in myself. The easiest move is to literally go and answer your closest friends/mentors/advisors what they think are the biggest problems in your life. This is a good strategy if you're interested in figuring out what your biggest problems are. On the meta level, the skill you might actually want to train is the ability to identify the biggest problems in your life, in which case you might want to try to figure it out yourself before you ask.</p>
<p>Simulate copies of your closest friends/advisors/mentors and ask them about yourself. What do they think the biggest problems in your life are?</p>
<p>(Yes, this is very silly in the sense that it's still <em>your brain</em> that's doing the simulation, which means you shouldn't be able to get new knowledge from just simulating. Brains are weird.)</p>
<p>Are there any obvious problems in what external observers would see if they observed your life? There's a failure mode in which people always have good explanations for why they're doing what they're doing, but if you actually observed their life, they're just spending 8 hours a day playing video games. Sometimes you're just rationalizing (but sometimes there actually <em>are</em> good reasons, like being a professional video game player).</p>
<h2>Pica</h2>
<p>People who are iron deficient sometimes <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9ZodFr54FtpLThHZh/experiential-pica"">eat a lot of ice</a>. This is called pica. The lesson we learn from this is that brains are bad at propagating needs into actions.</p>
<p>Do you <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/d922gAtBM8JNzkKKJ/p/2n83uRi36KWDC9LyK"">notice</a> anything confusing about your own behavior? Do you sometimes do things, ask yourself why, then give explanations that seem a little forced?</p>
<p>Somes humans act in confusing ways - not all ""weird"" behaviors are garbled needs. Don't psychoanalyze yourself (too much). However, it's worth considering whether or not behaviors your taking are pica-esque.</p>
<h2>Focusing</h2>
<p>The <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/d922gAtBM8JNzkKKJ/p/vHXe2f59bJHihvcBt"">focusing</a> check is to say ""everything in my life is fine"" outloud. Sometimes, there will be a part of you that sticks. This feeling might point to a part of your life that is not fine. This part of your life might be an important problem.</p>
<p>If you're brain is particularly helpful, you'll think about saying ""everything in my life is fine"" outloud and it'll respond with ""NOPE you don't have X or Y or Z"". Sometimes, however, you'll have problems that won't cause any sticking sensations. There are many hamming questions because they work for different types of people.</p>
<h2>Sparkles</h2>
<p>Timothy Ferris <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/35202-the-opposite-of-love-is-indifference-and-the-opposite-of"">writes</a> that ""the opposite of happiness is boredom"". By analogy, if not by exact argument, <a href=""https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Double_negation"">the opposite of the opposite is the thing itself</a>, so we infer that happiness is equivalent to excitement.</p>
<p>If you want to know what your life's purpose is, it's not that useful to ask yourself what makes you happy. When I ask myself this, my mind conjures images of serenity, moments that I enjoyed in the past. However, when I ask myself what makes me excited, I get images of achievement and triumph (the fact that there are no specific details is perhaps a bit troubling).</p>
<p>What sparkles in your life? What makes you excited? What makes your heart pound and your pulse thrum?</p>
<h1>Exercise</h1>
<p>(Only to be done if it does more good than harm)</p>
<p>Set aside 20 minutes, get a non-brain thought recording device, and seriously try to answer each of the questions.</p>

<p>I would hereby like to advertise a document <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jk2GgJnF9pLIQqg9hgX0Tvdukq6MR2qmXW3FyvqiiUg/edit?usp=sharing"">Systems of Services
as a Paradigm for AI Alignment
</a>. I hope that it can serve as a starting point for investigating AI alignment through the lens of systems of AI services. An alternative framing for the text is that it is a collection of pieces I have found particularly helpful for having productive conversations about the topic. In this post, I briefly recap the motivation behind the document and outline its contents. I also argue for why service-systems are a useful paradigm and mention my best guesses for promising future work.</p>
<h1>Motivating ideas</h1>
<p>As part of a <a href=""https://aisrp.org/"">recent collaboration</a>, we wanted to look over technical problems in Comprehensive AI Services (<a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/x3fNwSe5aWZb5yXEG/reframing-superintelligence-comprehensive-ai-services-as"">CAIS</a>), then pick one of them and study it in more detail. However, it soon turned out that a lot more conceptual work was needed before we can formalize any of our thoughts in a way that would be useful. We did study Drexler's <a href=""https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/reframing/"">Reframing Superintelligence</a> prior to embarking on this project, and the text indeed provides a lot of useful insights into the nature of advanced systems of AI services. However, it puts less emphasis on how to use the service framework for technical research. So from our starting position, we weren't sure how to define the basic concepts, how to model problems in CAIS, and what these problems even are.</p>
<p>We also decided to focus on a slightly different framing, mostly in two ways. First, Reframing Superintelligence primarily discusses <em>comprehensive</em> AI services, which are expected to be on par with a artificial <em>general</em> intelligence. Since we can reasonably expect AI X-risk to be associated with AI that is <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.00747"">radically transformative</a>, we wanted to deal with a broader class of systems. Second, it is likely that even very advanced AI services will be deeply entangled with services that are ""implemented on humans"". (Especially since we can view human organizations and institutions as clusters of services.) From this reason, <strong>the document studies <em>hybrid</em> systems of services that consist of both AI- and human services.</strong> Even if our interest is primarily in <em>AI</em> services, studying the whole system (including its non-AI parts) should make it easier to fully understand their impact on the world.</p>
<h1>Contents of the document</h1>
<p>While we did eventually make some progress on more specific problems, I thought it might be useful to write down a separate ""introductory"" text summarizing the things-that-seem-essential about the framework of service systems. Here is the document's slightly annotated table of contents:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Introduction</strong> (motivating the approach; skippable if you have read this post)</li>
<li><strong>Basic Concepts</strong> (explaining what we mean by services, tasks, and systems of services, defining several useful concepts, giving many examples)</li>
<li><strong>Modelling Approaches</strong> (describing different types of models we might later want to come up with for service systems; introducing a ""simple abstract model"" for this framework)</li>
<li><strong>Research Questions</strong> ( a) how to think about, and generate lists of, problems and other research tasks for this paradigm; b) a list of research questions, not exhaustive but reasonably wide)</li>
<li><strong>Related Fields of Study</strong> (a list of existing research fields that seem particularly relevant)</li>
<li><strong>Research Suggestions</strong> (references for further reading, our guesses for what might be valuable to investigate)</li>
</ol>
<h1>Some of our conclusions</h1>
<p>We think the paradigm of systems of services deserves further attention. In terms of <em>technical</em> alignment research, it might expose some new problems and provide a new point of view on the existing ones. Moreover, AI currently takes the form of services, rather than agents. As a result, the service-system paradigm might be more suitable for communicating with wider audience (e.g., the public, less technical fields like AI policy, and AI researchers from outside of the long-termist community).</p>
<p>We have no definitive answers for what work needs to be done in this area, but some of the useful directions seem to be:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Technical problems and formalization.</strong> Formalizing and getting progress on technical problems in service systems. As a side product, we might also attempt to build more solid foundations for the paradigm (i.e., formalizing the basic concepts, building mathematical models).</li>
<li><strong>Building on top of <em>Reframing Superintelligence</em>:</strong> Drexler's text identifies and informally states many important hypotheses about the nature of AI-service systems, such as the claim that there will be no compelling incentives to replace comprehensive narrow services by an ""agent-like"" AGI (Section 12). We believe it would be valuable to (a) map out the different hypotheses and assumptions made in the report and (b) formalize specific hypotheses and explore them further.</li>
<li><strong>Tools or agents?</strong> Many people seem to believe that while ""agent-like"" AGI and “fully-automated comprehensive system of services” might have similar capabilities, there is some fundamental difference between the two types of AI. At the same time, there seems to be a general confusion around this topic. Some relevant questions are:
<ol>
<li>Can we find a framework in which these similarities and differences could be explained or dissolved?</li>
<li>In particular, does there perhaps exist a formalization of “agency” that can differentiate between the two?</li>
<li>If there are meaningful distinctions, how do they translate into what it means to “align” each type of AI?</li>
<li>How does the effectivity of narrow-purpose algorithms differ from the effectivity of general-purpose algorithms? Should we expect economic pressures towards generality (and maybe even ""agent-like"" AGI)?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Identifying connections to existing fields.</strong> In many cases, problems with AI services will ""merely"" be automated versions of problems previously studied in other fields (e.g., automating the police might seemingly push some aspects of law under the umbrella of AI). For people who already have an expertise both in AI risk and in some relevant field, it might thus be valuable to clarify the connection of the two. On the one hand, clearly laying out how existing fields relate to service-systems might prevent other alignment researchers from reinventing the wheel by ignoring the existing research. On the other hand, it is important to identify the  problems that arise when the existing field gets applied to service-systems and AI risk. We can then bring these new problems to the attention of the existing research communities, thus offloading some of the work (and possibly steering the field towards topics with more long-term impact). A prime example of a field whose utilization might be highly impactful is <strong>AI ethics</strong>. <em>However, due to effects like <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inoculation_theory"">idea inoculation</a>, reputation costs (to AI risk), and <a href=""https://concepts.effectivealtruism.org/concepts/unilateralists-curse/"">unilateralist’s curse</a>, we think this task should only be attempted by people who are experienced at communicating ideas on this level and well-positioned to do so.</em></li>

They fit these curves to death counts.  (Technically, they fit a Gaussian CDF -- which looks sigmoid-like -- to cumulative deaths, and then recover a bell curve projection for daily deaths by taking the derivative of the fitted curve.)</p><p><em>Objection 1.&#xA0;&#xA0;</em>Curve fitting to a time series is a weird choice if you want to model something whose dynamics change over time as social distancing policies are imposed and lifted.&#xA0; IHME has a state-by-state model input that captures differences in when states implemented restrictions (collapsed down to 1 number), but it isn&#x2019;t <em>time</em>-dependent, just <em>state</em>-dependent.&#xA0; So their model can learn that states with different policies will tend to have differently shaped or shifted curves <em>overall</em> &#x2013; but it can&#x2019;t modify the shape of the curves to reflect the impacts of restrictions <em>when they happened.</em></p><p><em>Objection 2.&#xA0; </em>Curve fitting produces misleading confidence bands.</p><p>Many people quickly noticed something weird about the IHME&#x2019;s confidence bands: the model got <em>more</em>&#xA0;confident the further out in the future you looked.</p><p>How can that be possible?&#xA0; Well, uncertainty estimates from a curve fit aren&#x2019;t about <em>what will happen</em>.&#xA0; They&#x2019;re about what the curve looks like.</p><p>With a bell-shaped curve, it&#x2019;s&#xA0;&#x201C;harder&#x201D; to move the tails of the curve around than to move the peak around &#x2013; that is, you have to change the curve parameters more to make it happen.&#xA0; (Example: the distribution of human heights says very confidently that 100-foot people are extremely rare; you have to <em>really</em>&#xA0;shift or squash the curve to change that.)</p><p>To interpret these bands as uncertainty about the future, you&#x2019;d need to model the world like this: reality <em>will</em>&#xA0;follow some Gaussian curve, plus noise.&#xA0; Our task is to figure out which curve we&#x2019;re on, given some prior distribution over the curves.&#xA0; If the curves were a law of nature, and their parameters the unknown constants of this law, this would be exactly the right thing to do.&#xA0; But no one has this model of reality.&#xA0; The future&#xA0;is the accumulation of past effects; it does not simply trace out a pre-determined arc, except in science fiction or perhaps Thomism.</p><p><em>Objection 3. </em>Curve symmetry causes perverse predictions.<br></p><p><a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com/CT_Bergstrom/status/1250304069119275009"">Bergstrom brought this up recently</a>.&#xA0; The use of a symmetric bell curve means the model will always predict a decline that exactly mirrors the ascent.</p><p>This creates problems when a curve has been successfully flattened and is being held at a roughly flat position.&#xA0; The functional form can&#x2019;t accommodate that &#x2013; it can&#x2019;t made the peak wider without changing everything else &#x2013; so it always notices what looks like a peak, and predicts an immediate decline.&#xA0; If you stay flat 1 more day, the model extends its estimated decline by 1 day.&#xA0; If you stay flat 7 more days, you get 7 more days on the other side.&#xA0; If you&#x2019;re approximately flat, the model will always tell you tomorrow will look like yesterday, and 3 months from now will look like 3 months ago.</p><p>(Put another way, the model under-predicts its own future estimates, again and again and again.)</p><p>This can have the <a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com/CT_Bergstrom/status/1250369165984010241"">weird effect</a> of pushing future estimates <em>down</em>&#xA0;in light of unexpectedly high current data: the latter makes the model update to an overall-<em>steeper </em>curve, which means a steeper descent on the other side of it.</p><p>(EDIT 4/20: wanted to clarify this point.</p><p>There are two different mechanisms that can cause the curve to decline back to zero: either R0 goes below 1 [i.e. a &#x201C;suppressed&#x201D; epidemic], or the % of the population still susceptible trends toward 0 [i.e. an &#x201C;uncontrolled&#x201D; epidemic reaching herd immunity and burning itself out].</p><p>If you see more cases than expected, that should <em>lower</em>&#xA0;your estimate of future % susceptible, and <em>raise</em>&#xA0;your estimate of future R0.&#xA0; That is, the epidemic is being less well controlled than you expected, so you should update towards more future spread and more future immunity.</p><p>In an uncontrolled epidemic, immunity is what makes the curve eventually decline, so in this case the model&#x2019;s update would make sense.&#xA0; But the model <em>isn&#x2019;t</em> modeling an uncontrolled epidemic -- if its projections actually happen, we&#x2019;ll be way below herd immunity at the end.</p><p>So the decline seen in the model&#x2019;s curves must be interpreted as a projection of successful &#x201C;suppression,&#x201D; with R0 below 1.&#xA0; But if it&#x2019;s the lowered R0 that causes the decline, then the update doesn&#x2019;t make sense: more cases than expected means higher R0 than expected, which means a&#xA0;<em>less</em>&#xA0;sharp decline than expected, not more.)</p><p>This stuff has perverse implications for forecasts about when things end, which unfortunately IHME is playing up a lot &#x2013; they&#x2019;re reporting estimates of when each state will be able to lift restrictions (!) based on the curve dipping below some threshold. &#xA0;(<a href=""https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america/new-york"">Example</a>)</p><p>EDIT 4/20: forgot to link this last night, but there&#x2019;s a great website&#xA0;<a href=""http://www.covid-projections.com/"">http://www.covid-projections.com/</a>&#xA0;that lets you see successive forecasts from the IHME on one axis.&#xA0; So you can evaluate for yourself how well the model updates over time.</p><p><strong>Words</strong></p><p>I remain frustrated with the amount of arguing over whether we should do X or Y, where X and Y are ambiguous words which different parties define in conflicting ways.</p><p><a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com/CT_Bergstrom/status/1251620002324594688"">FlattenTheCurve is still causing the same confusions</a>.&#xA0;&#xA0;Sure, whatever, I&#x2019;ve accepted that one.&#xA0; But in reading over some of the stuff I argued about in March, I&#x2019;ve come to realize that a lot of other terms aren&#x2019;t defined consistently even across academic work.</p><p><em>Mitigation and suppression</em></p><p>To Joscha Bach,&#xA0;&#x201C;mitigation&#x201D; meant the herd immunity strategy.&#xA0; <a href=""https://twitter.com/CT_Bergstrom/status/1243474427129376768"">Bergstrom took him to task for this</a>, saying it wasn&#x2019;t what it meant in the field.</p><p>But the Imperial College London papers (<a href=""https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf"">1</a>, <a href=""https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-Global-Impact-26-03-2020.pdf"">2</a>) also appear to mean&#xA0;&#x201C;herd immunity&#x201D; by&#xA0;&#x201C;mitigation.&#x201D;&#xA0; They form their &#x201C;mitigation scenarios&#x201D; by assuming a single peak with herd immunity at the end, and then computing the least-bad scenario consistent with those constraints.</p><p>When they come out in favor of&#xA0;&#x201C;suppression&#x201D; instead of&#xA0;&#x201C;mitigation,&#x201D; they are really saying that we must lower R0 far enough that we <em>don&#x2019;t</em>&#xA0;have a plan to get herd immunity and are basically waiting for a vaccine, either under permanent restrictions or trigger-based on/off restrictions.</p><p>But the &#x201C;mitigation&#x201D; strategy imagined here seems like either a straw man, or possibly an accurate assessment of the bizarre bad idea they were trying to combat in the UK at that exact moment.</p><p>Even in the&#xA0;&#x201C;mitigation scenarios,&#x201D; some NPI is done.&#xA0; Indeed, the authors consider the same range of interventions as in the&#xA0;&#x201C;suppression scenarios.&#x201D;&#xA0; The difference is that, in&#xA0;&#x201C;mitigation,&#x201D; the policies are kept light <em>enough</em>&#xA0;that the virus still infects most of the population.&#xA0; Here are some stats from their second paper:</p><blockquote>If mitigation including enhanced social distancing is pursued, for an R0 of 3.0, we estimate a maximum reduction in infections in the range [&#x2026;] These optimal reductions in transmission and burden were achieved with a range of reductions in the overall rate of social contact between 40.0%- 44.9% (median 43.9%) [&#x2026;]<br><br>We also explored the impact of more rigorous social distancing approaches aimed at immediate suppression of transmission. We looked at 6 suppression scenarios [&#x2026;] the effects of widespread transmission suppression were modelled as a uniform reduction in contact rates by 75%, applied across all age-groups<br></blockquote><p>In other words, if you still want herd immunity at the end, you can ask people to reduce their social contact ~43% (which is a lot!), but not more.&#xA0; The&#xA0;&#x201C;mitigation&#x201D; strategy as imagined here is bizarre: you have to be open to non-trivial NPI, open to asking your population to nearly halve their social interaction, but <em>not</em>&#xA0;wiling to go further &#x2013; <em>specifically</em>&#xA0;because you <em>want</em>&#xA0;the whole population to get infected.</p><p>Meanwhile, I&#x2019;ve seen&#xA0;<a href=""https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30567-5/fulltext"">other academic sources</a>&#xA0;use&#xA0;&#x201C;mitigation&#x201D; in closer to Bergstrom&#x2019;s sense, as general term for NPI and any other measures that slow the spread.&#xA0; (That paper also uses&#xA0;&#x201C;flatten&#x201D; in this same generic way.)</p><p><em>Containment</em></p><p>When Bach writes&#xA0;&#x201C;containment,&#x201D; he seems to mean the thing called&#xA0;&#x201C;suppression&#x201D; by ICL.&#xA0; (I.e. the good thing everyone wants, where you impose measures and don&#x2019;t mysteriously stop them short of what would curtail herd immunity.)</p><p>When <em>ICL</em>&#xA0;write&#xA0;&#x201C;containment,&#x201D; they appear to mean something different.&#xA0; Among their suppression scenarios, they compare one&#xA0;confusingly labelled&#xA0;&#x201C;suppression&#x201D; to another labelled&#xA0;&#x201C;containment&#x201D; &#x2013; see <a href=""https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf"">their Fig. 3</a>&#xA0;in the 3/16 paper.&#xA0; The difference is that, among interventions, &#x201C;containment&#x201D; lacks school closure but adds household quarantine.&#xA0; This agrees with the intuitive meaning of&#xA0;&#x201C;containment,&#x201D; but differs from Bach&#x2019;s use&#xA0;<em>and </em><a href=""https://twitter.com/i/status/1241379786867556355"">Bergstrom&#x2019;s different usage</a>.</p><p><em>Lockdown</em></p><p>I have no idea what this means.&#xA0; Apparently I&#x2019;m in one right now?&#xA0; To Bach, it appears to mean (at least) city-level travel restrictions, a key component of Bach!Containment but not considered by ICL or other academics I&#x2019;ve read.</p><p>While trying to Google this, I found <a href=""https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2020/3/10/21171464/coronavirus-us-lockdown-travel-restriction-italy"">this Vox article</a>, which, well:</p><blockquote>&#x201C;The term &#x2018;lock-down&#x2019; isn&#x2019;t a technical term used by public health officials or lawyers,&#x201D; Lindsay Wiley, a health law professor at the Washington College of Law, said in an email. &#x201C;It could be used to refer to anything from mandatory geographic quarantine (which would probably be unconstitutional under most scenarios in the US), to non-mandatory recommendations to shelter in place (which are totally legal and can be issued by health officials at the federal, state, or local level), to anything in between (e.g. ordering certain events or types of businesses to close, which is generally constitutional if deemed necessary to stop the spread of disease based on available evidence).&#x201D;</blockquote><p><em>Hammer, dance</em></p><p>These probably mean something, but I cite all of the above as justification for my preemptive wariness about getting into any kind of argument about&#xA0;&#x201C;whether we should do the hammer,&#x201D; or who&#x2019;s currently&#xA0;&#x201C;doing the dance.&#x201D;</p>",nostalgebraist,nostalgebraist,nostalgebraist,

This is counterintuitive, because wealth is associated with longevity (e.g. <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4866586/"">Chetty et al. 2016</a>) . There were a lot of potential explanations for this centering on how work was dangerous and <a href=""https://www.nber.org/papers/w9468.pdf"">didn&#x2019;t leave time for health</a>, but it turns out most of the additional deaths are concentrated among groups that were unlikely to be employed in the first place, such as those over 70 (70% of the total) or under 4. Fewer than 10% of the additional deaths occur among those between the ages of 25 and 64 (<a href=""https://www.nber.org/papers/w17657.pdf?new_window=1"">Stevens et al 2011</a>).</p><p>Why does employment of working-age adults have such an impact on elderly mortality? <a href=""https://www.nber.org/papers/w17657.pdf?new_window=1"">Stevens et al</a>make a compelling case that it&#x2019;s because widespread unemployment increases the relative number of people willing to take unpleasant, low-paying nursing home jobs, particularly entry level &#x201C;aide&#x201D; positions, and this improves care of residents.</p><h1>Fertility</h1><p>My prediction: recessions lead to a moderate drop in number of live births</p><p>The effect of economic downturns on births is surprisingly complicated. On one hand, people have less money and kids are expensive*, which you would expect to lead to fewer children.

Some trends:</p><ul><li>The reduction in births is seen mostly in younger women (20-24), not older women (30-34), suggesting this is a voluntary decision incorporating knowledge of ability to have children in the future.</li><li>The effect is much larger for first births than subsequent births, suggesting this may be more about union formation than post-union decisions to have children (this could also explain the age-related effects)</li><li>The change seems to be driven more by change in situation than by absolute status, i.e. there isn&#x2019;t a strict relationship between per capita GDP or unemployment and fertility that holds across countries, but in countries where children and women have the same status, people will react similarly to a change in circumstance.</li><li>Male unemployment is universally bad for fertility.</li><li>Female unemployment depends on the era (used to be positively associated with fertility, now is negatively) and on a woman&#x2019;s socioeconomic status (richer/better educated women&#x2019;s fertility is more procyclic than poorer/worse education women&#x2019;s).</li><li>Generous unemployment insurance or non-employment-linked maternity benefits unsurprisingly raise the birth rate during a recession.</li></ul><p>Specific numbers are hard to give because every country, demographic, and recession is different, but as an example, <a href=""https://scholars.unh.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1230&amp;context=carsey"">this article</a> estimates ~9% decrease in fertility in 2013 in the US.</p><p>* This is in societies where children are economic sinks.

Studies typically found a much larger effect in men than women, sometimes finding no change in the female suicide rate at all. Different studies found different effects on different age groups; these felt too subdivided to me and I ignored them.

Last summer I wrote </span>

<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/bass-whistle"">some code</a> that would
let you control a bass synthesizer by whistling (

<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/real-time-bass-whistling"">details</a>).  I wrote it in a 

<a href=""https://github.com/jeffkaufman/iPlug2/blob/master/Examples/BassWhistle/BassWhistle.cpp"">low-level
language</a> so I could minimize latency, but the downside is that
it's a bit of a pain to install and try out.  After playing around
with the 

<a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API"">Web
Audio API</a> 

<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/web-audio-echo"">yesterday</a>, however, I
realized I could make a demo in JavaScript.  Here it is: 

<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/bass-whistle-js"">bass-whistle-js</a>.



</p><p>

Currently this only works in Chrome, because Firefox and Safari <a href=""https://caniuse.com/#search=audioworklet"">haven't implemented
AudioWorklet yet</a>.  It has enough latency to be painful, even
though the AudioContext is running with <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioContextLatencyCategory"">minimum
latency settings</a>.  I suspect this is Chrome layering several
buffers, and comes from optimizing for something other than what I
want (cross-platform, simplicity, minimizing dropouts, power
consumption).  Still, it's neat that this works at all!

</p>

<p>

Debugging my AudioWorklet port was painful, as browser debugging goes.
Devtools doesn't understand the worklet very well, and so several
syntax errors in the worklet were reported as syntax errors in the UI
thread code.  The devtools ""disable cache"" setting also doesn't seem
to apply to worklet modules, and they don't even show up in the
Network tab, so I put in a cachebuster during development.

<h1>Why this database may be valuable</h1>
<p>I’d bet that the majority of people reading this sentence have, at some point, seen one or more estimates of extinction risk by the year 2100, from <em>one particular source</em>.<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-3oww2afJG3wKkkMrD-1"" id=""fnref-3oww2afJG3wKkkMrD-1"">[1]</a></sup> These estimates may in fact have played a role in major decisions of yours; I believe they played a role in my own career transition. That source is <a href=""https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/reports/2008-1.pdf"">an informal survey</a> of <a href=""https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/EMKf4Gyee7BsY2RP8/michaela-s-shortform?commentId=vgqcDG9nMdMx8c3aj"">global catastrophic risk</a> researchers, from <em>2008</em>.</p>
<p>As <a href=""https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1089/hs.2017.0028"">Millett and Snyder-Beattie</a> note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The disadvantage [of that survey] is that the estimates were likely highly subjective and unreliable, especially as the survey did not account for response bias, and the respondents were not calibrated beforehand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally, in any case, it was just one informal survey, and is now <em>12 years old</em>.<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-3oww2afJG3wKkkMrD-2"" id=""fnref-3oww2afJG3wKkkMrD-2"">[2]</a></sup> So why is it so frequently referenced? And why has it plausibly (in my view) influenced so many people?</p>
<p>I also expect that essentially the same pattern is likely to repeat, perhaps for another dozen years, but now with <a href=""https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Z5KZ2cui8WDjyF6gJ/my-thoughts-on-toby-ord-s-existential-risk-estimates"">Toby Ord’s recent existential risk estimates</a>. Why do I expect this?</p>
<p>I originally thought the answer to each of these questions was essentially that we have <em>so little</em> else to go on, and the topic is <em>so important</em>. It seemed to me there had just been <em>so few attempts</em> to actually estimate existential risks or similarly extreme outcomes (e.g., extinction risk, reduction in the expected value of the long-term future).</p>
<p>I’d argue that this causes two problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>We have less information to inform decisions such as whether to prioritise longtermism over other cause areas, whether to prioritise existential risk reduction over other longtermist strategies, and especially <em>which</em> existential risks to be most concerned about.</li>
<li>We may <a href=""https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/KfqFLDkoccf8NQsQe/potential-downsides-of-using-explicit-probabilities"">anchor</a> too strongly on the very sparse set of estimates we <em>are</em> aware of, and get caught in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_cascade"">information cascades</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Indeed, it seems to me probably not ideal how many strategic decisions people concerned about existential risks (myself included) have made so far without having first collected and critiqued a wide array of such estimates.</p>
<p>This second issue seems all the more concerning given the many reasons we have for skepticism about estimates on these matters, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>The lack of directly relevant data (e.g., prior human extinction events) to inform the estimates</li>
<li>Estimates often being little more than quick guesses</li>
<li>It often being hard to interpret what is actually being estimated</li>
<li>The possibility of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_bias"">response bias</a></li>
<li>The estimators typically being people who are especially concerned about existential risks, and thus arguably being essentially <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_bias"">“selected for”</a> above average pessimism</li>
<li><a href=""https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/how-feasible-long-range-forecasting"">A general lack of evidence about the trustworthiness of long-range forecasts</a>, and specific evidence of expert forecasts often being unreliable even for forecasts of events just a few years out (e.g., from <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_Political_Judgment:_How_Good_Is_It"">Tetlock</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, we may be anchoring on a small handful of estimates which could in fact warrant little trust.</p>
<p>But what else are we to do? One option would be to each form our own, independent estimates. This may be ideal, which is why I opened by linking to <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XUwqBPQ-sFkO5h4tdYrVvlK8ooFWyR8XbBVntt820JI/edit?usp=sharing"">a spreadsheet</a> you can duplicate to do that in.</p>
<p>But it seems plausible that “expert” estimates of these long-range, extreme outcomes would correlate better with what the future actually has in store for us than the estimates most of us could come up with, at least without investing a great deal of time into it. (Though I’m certainly not sure of that, and I don’t know of any <em>directly</em> relevant evidence. Plus, Tetlock’s work may provide some reason to doubt the idea that “experts” can be assumed to make better forecasts in general.)</p>
<p>And in any case, most of us have probably already been exposed to a handful of relevant estimates, making it harder to generate “independent” estimates of our own.</p>
<p>So I decided to collect all quantitative estimates I could find of existential risks or other similarly “extreme outcomes”, as this might:</p>
<ol>
<li>Be useful for decision-making, because I do <em>think</em> these estimates are likely better than nothing or than just phrases like “plausible”, plausibly by a very large margin.</li>
<li>Reduce a relatively “blind” reliance on any <em>particular</em> source of estimates, and perhaps even make it easier for people to produce <em>effectively</em> somewhat independent estimates. My hope is that providing a variety of <em>different</em> estimates will throw anchors in many directions (so to speak) in a way that somewhat “cancels out”, and that it’ll also highlight the occasionally major discrepancies between different estimates. I do not want you to take these estimates as gospel.</li>
</ol>
<p>Above, I said “I originally thought the answer to each of these questions was essentially that we have <em>so little</em> else to go on, and the topic is <em>so important</em>.” I still think that’s not far off the truth. But since starting this database, I discovered <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016328719303313"">Beard et al.’s</a> appendix, which has a variety of other relevant estimates. And I wondered whether that meant this database wouldn’t be useful.</p>
<p>But then I realised that many or most of the relevant estimates from that appendix weren’t mentioned in Ord’s book. And it’s still the case that I’ve seen the 2008 survey estimates <em>many</em> times, and <em>never</em> seen most of the estimates in Beard et al.’s appendix (see <a href=""https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/frYYAAa5K4nHqRCPG/current-estimates-for-likelihood-of-x-risk"">this post</a> for an indication that I’m not alone in that). And Beard et al. don’t mention Ord’s estimates (perhaps because it was released a couple months before Ord’s book was), nor a variety of other estimates I found (perhaps because they’re from “informal sources” like 80,000 Hours articles).</p>
<p>So I still think collecting all relevant estimates in one place may be useful. And another benefit is that this database can be updated over time, including via suggestions from readers, so it can hopefully become comprehensive and stay up to date.</p>

This is the first of a couple of building-block posts which I expect to spin out so I have things to reference when I finally make it to the main point. This post fits neatly into my old (2014!) <a href=""https://grandunifiedcrazy.com/2014/01/16/roadmap-2-systems-theory/"">sequence on <em>systems theory</em></a> and should be considered a belated addition to that.</p><p>Systems can be <a href=""https://grandunifiedcrazy.com/2014/01/23/systems-determinism-and-randomness/"">deterministic or random</a>. A system that is random is, of course&#x2026; random. I&#x2019;m glad the difficult half of this essay is out of the way! Kidding aside, the interesting part is that from the inside, <em>a system that is deterministic also appears random</em>. This claim is technically a bit stronger than I can really argue, but it guides the intuition better than the more formal version.</p><p>Because <a href=""https://grandunifiedcrazy.com/2014/02/17/recursive-abstractions-and-approximate-models/"">no proper subsystem can perfectly simulate its parent</a>, every inside-the-system simulation must ultimately exclude information, either via the use of lossy abstractions or by choosing to simulate only a <a href=""https://grandunifiedcrazy.com/2014/01/27/subsystems-and-closure/"">proper, open subsystem</a> of the parent. In either case, the excluded information effectively appears in the simulation as randomness: fundamentally unpredictable additional input.</p><p>This has some interesting implications if <a href=""https://grandunifiedcrazy.com/2014/02/20/reality-as-a-system/"">reality is a system</a> and we&#x2019;re inside it, as I believe to be the case. First it means that we cannot ever conclusively prove whether the universe is deterministic (a la Laplace&#x2019;s Demon) or random. We can still make some strong probabilistic arguments, but a full proof becomes impossible.</p><p>Second, it means that we can safely assume the existence of &#x201C;atomic randomness&#x201D; in all of our models. If the system is random, then atomic randomness is in some sense &#x201C;real&#x201D; and we&#x2019;re done. But if the system is deterministic, then we can pretend atomic randomness is real, because the information necessary to dispel that apparent randomness is provably unavailable to us. In some sense the distinction doesn&#x2019;t even matter anymore; whether the information is provably unavailable or just doesn&#x2019;t exist, our models look the same.</p>",,,,

The Sequences are obviously a great start, and once someone has &quot;read the sequences&quot;, they are highly likely to have a good idea of what the Rationalist Movement is all about, but someone unsure of whether they are interested or not is unlikely to commit to reading such a lengthy set of articles.</p><p>In my quest to find a way to short-cut this process, I have come across many other posts trying to do something similar, but all are still quite... long winded.

It is not that one couldn&apos;t necessarily convince someone to read these, but they can&apos;t exactly be rolled off the tongue in mid conversation.  Anything that I have previously read that is a short and pithy description of Rationality can either easily be woefully misinterpreted, resulting in &#x201C;so Rationalists want us to all be emotionless robots then? Count me out!&#x201D;, or is really a description of a small subset of the community, making it sound far more specific and exclusive than it actually is.  Here are another two articles that come remarkably close:</p><p><a href=""https://putanumonit.com/2016/05/17/rationality/"">The Secret Society for Suppressing Stupidity</a> (3815 words)</p><p><a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/11/27/why-i-am-not-rene-descartes/"">Why I Am Not Rene Descartes</a> (3480 words)</p><p>These articles focus heavily on defending Rationality against its detractors, which is again very reasonable, however unfortunately these still don&#x2019;t easily boil down into a short, hard to misinterpret definition.  Therefore, I will make an attempt to describe what I consider Rationality and the Rationalist Movement to be, and not to be, in a way that can be boiled down without losing all subtlety.<br></p><h4>I. What it is not<br></h4><p>Firstly, I shall deal with what Rationality is not.  Unfortunately, there are several schools of philosophy that Rationality is often conflated with, so I will go through each of them, and briefly detail the differences.  If you are not in the mood for a foray into the delights of 17th and 18th century western philosophy, I recommend skipping straight to section II, where I will start discussing what Rationality is instead.<br></p><p>The main stumbling block is that it is rather unhelpfully named - Rationality is not the practice of the 17th and 18th century philosophy of Rationalism.  In fact, if you go to the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationalism"">Wikipedia article on Rationalism</a>, at the very top of the page is a disambiguation note &#x201C;Not to be confused with Rationality&#x201D;.  Although Rationalism has several things in common with the current Rationalist Movement such as an appreciation for logical argument, it was actually developed in opposition to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empiricism"">Empiricism</a>, positing that reality has a fundamentally logical structure, and therefore that purely logical thinking can deduce truths about reality without reference to experiment or our senses.  Rationality is also not the same as, nor does it advocate <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_planning_model"">Rational Planning</a>.  In the mid 20th century, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_modernism"">high modernism</a> was very much in vogue, and the term &#x201C;rational&#x201D; was used to silence opposition to huge and often disastrous reforms.  This Rational Planning can be seen as the logical conclusion of 18th century Rationalism, and its outcomes can be seen as the exact reason Empiricism was right to oppose its disdain for evidence and experiment.<br></p><p>Nor can we say that Rationality is purely the practice of Empiricism either however.  With its focus on evidence, falsification and the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method"">Scientific Method</a>, Empiricism also has a great deal in common with the current Rationalist Movement.  Unfortunately however, historically it takes a rather dim view of any attempts at theoretical inquiry.  This is not to say there were not people that managed to subscribe to both Rationalism and Empiricism, but as with many philosophical disagreements, the tyranny of small differences usually wins out.  If we were to describe Rationality as the practice of the philosophy of Empiricism, it would carry a great deal of historical baggage, suggesting an opposition to theorising, rather than a symbiosis with it.<br></p><p>What about <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_skepticism"">Skepticism</a>?  Again, lots in common with the Rationalist Movement - the suspension of judgement due to the inadequacy of evidence is an important principle that could be seen as a cornerstone of modern Rationality, but the philosophy of Skepticism once again goes too far to be able to be seen as representative.  The goal of modern Rationality is partly to allow people to make better decisions, and to more reliably achieve their goals, but Skepticism borders on an almost nihilistic view of knowledge, obsessing over uncertainty at the expense of practical considerations.<br></p><p>So far we have established several things that Rationality is not.  Rationalism, Empiricism and Skepticism all come close in different areas, but all overshoot the mark, making claims that are too bold.  The philosophy of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragmatism"">Pragmatism</a> established in the 1870s by Charles Sanders Peirce manages to bridge the gap between deductivist Rationalism, inductivist Empiricism and nihilist Skepticism nicely, placing focus on the practical uses and effects of ideas.  The benefit of experiment is clear when looked at from a practical perspective, but theorising is itself worthwhile if it results in a practical benefit.  Uncertainty is a key concern in practical situations, but Pragmatism&#x2019;s aim is to mitigate or manage this uncertainty.<br></p><h4>II. Narrowing it down<br></h4><span><figure><img src=""http://box5793.temp.domains/~atlaspra/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Pragmatism-Venn-Diagram.png"" class=""draft-image "" style=""width:40%""></figure></span><p>We now have a neat Venn diagram with the three philosophies of Rationalism, Empiricism and Skepticism as the circles and Pragmatism at the intersection of all three in the centre. Within Pragmatism, we see many familiar Rationalist concepts.  The idea of knowledge as &#x201C;that upon which a man is prepared to act&#x201D;.  Awareness of the <a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/11/21/the-categories-were-made-for-man-not-man-for-the-categories/"">&#x201C;philosophical fallacy&#x201D;</a> (the danger of taking categories for granted, without acknowledging that the divisions are entirely invented).  Embracing the Scientific Method as a means to encroach upon the unknown.  Endeavouring to make <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praxis_(process)"">praxis</a> out of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology"">epistemology</a> (implementing the philosophy&#x2019;s methods and conclusions in reality, rather than leaving it as an entirely academic exercise).  Pragmatism also naturally lends itself to a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequentialism"">consequentialist</a> view of ethics, due to the importance it places on real world effects.  This leads us to a reasonably good definition of Rationality, which encompasses the practical application of the Scientific Method, experiment and evidence, as well as logical thought, and an awareness of any limitations and uncertainty, to achieving our goals.  It still feels like we are missing something however.  The philosophy of Pragmatism does get very close to the ideology of Rationality, but it slightly undershoots instead - there are other key things that are quite fundamental to the modern Rationalist Movement, without which the ideology feels rather vague and incomplete.<br></p><p>Perhaps because it is so often conflated with 18th century Rationalism, and therefore blamed for the excesses of high modernism, there is a deep vein of intellectual honesty running through the modern Rationalist Movement.  The idea that the truth should win out, and that we should aim for what is true to be what we think, not for what we think to be what is true, results in a culture that among other things places value on disagreements being collaborative.  To quote Richard Feynman:</p><blockquote>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s a kind of scientific integrity, a principle of scientific thought that corresponds to a kind of utter honesty&#x2014;a kind of leaning over backwards.  For example, if you&#x2019;re doing an experiment, you should report everything that you think might make it invalid&#x2014;not only what you think is right about it: other causes that could possibly explain your results; and things you thought of that you&#x2019;ve eliminated by some other experiment, and how they worked&#x2014;to make sure the other fellow can tell they have been eliminated.&#x201D;</blockquote><p>Because this kind of modesty is not usually something that comes naturally to people, it is this quality that makes it relatively easy to differentiate between people that are part of the Rationalist Movement, and people with an extreme political opinion that they justify as being &#x201C;rational&#x201D;.  Anyone claiming to &#x201C;destroy their opponent&#x201D; in a discussion using &#x201C;facts, logic and rationality&#x201D; can reasonably be assumed to be one of the latter, not the former.<br></p><p>There is also a particular focus within the Rationalist Movement on <a href=""http://www.overcomingbias.com/"">cognitive biases</a>.  Whilst this is not a fundamental principle, in the way that evidence and logical thought are, it is a cornerstone of the culture.  Even if people choose to ignore their biases, which Rationalists may decide to do from time to time for various reasons, there is a view that it is useful to know what they are, and that people have them (even though knowing about them might make them worse).  The ability to avoid these biases when appropriate can be helpful in pursuing logical thought, and in achieving goals more effectively.  This is not to say that the Rationalist Movement is entirely devoid of emotion however - it is a false dichotomy to view emotions as irrelevant to Rationality.  A better dichotomy would be to view thought processes as analytic or empathetic - both are valuable and have real world consequences.  While Rationalists are often stereotyped as being far more analytic than empathetic, it is more that there is a balance to be found between both.  Often in everyday life, emotion can overwhelm other considerations, so people trying to find a balance between analysis and empathy can be considered heartless, which is unfortunate.<br></p><p>Furthermore, no description of Rationality would be complete without mentioning Bayes.  Again, not a fundamental principle, but <a href=""https://arbital.com/p/bayes_rule/?l=1zq"">Bayesian probability theory</a> is a very important idea for the Rationalist Movement.  As a culture with a great focus on the importance of the Scientific Method, there is a great frustration with abuses of statistics often committed in both the scientific community and the world at large.  Bayesian probability theory is seen by many in the Rationalist Movement as a better, simpler, more reliable and less open to abuse method of performing statistical analysis.<br></p><h4>III. Bayesian Pragmatism</h4><p>Based on this reasoning, in future my go-to definition of Rationality will be:</p><blockquote>&#x201C;The philosophy of Pragmatism (the practical application of the Scientific Method, experiment and evidence, as well as logical thought, and an awareness of any limitations and uncertainty, to achieving our goals), with a particular focus on Bayesian statistics and cognitive biases.&#x201D; (41 words)</blockquote><p>Rationality still an unhelpful name though.  Maybe &#x201C;Bayesian Pragmatism&#x201D; will catch on instead?  &#x2026;no, I didn&#x2019;t think so either - we&#x2019;re stuck with it.</p>",Mellivora,mellivora,Mellivora,

Most of the discussion of mask usage to prevent transmission has so far been centered on surgical masks and disposable filtering facepiece particle (FFP) masks (also called respirators sometimes). Surgical masks do not form an airtight seal to the face and thus can&apos;t reliably prevent transmission. Achieving a tight fit with FFP masks is tricky and at least requires some practice.

Safe usage should be much easier to achieve than with FFP masks due to the mask body having a flexible silicone edge that can form a tight seal with the face. Additionally, they are equipped with one-way valves that prevent the filters from being soaked by the wearers&apos; breath. They are more expensive than the other mask types (~50$), but can be easily mass-produced using injection molding. Thus, widespread use of such masks seems highly desirable and might play a big part in reducing effective transmission rates without requiring severe social-distancing measures. Compared to the economic costs of these measures, the cost of providing these masks to everyone, at least in industrialized countries, seems to be negligible. (<em><strong>Much</strong></em> more detail can be found in the<a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yKYg6D7HNxLuJDcLS/hammer-and-mask-wide-spread-use-of-reusable-particle""> <u>previously mentioned post</u></a>.)</p><h2><strong>Call to action</strong></h2><p>Given the plausibility and potential benefit of the idea described above, it is urgent that we take action to promote it or figure out if it is wrong.

The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program"">hello
world</a> of audio processing is an echo:



<pre>
def processAudio(samples):
  return samples
</pre>

You take a buffer of samples and then return them unmodified, echoing
the audio back out.  For example, when I built my 

<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/bass-whistle"">bass whistle</a>, that's where I started.



</p><p>

Today <a href=""http://www.davidchudzicki.com/"">David</a> and I were
trying to see if we could build my <a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/series-singing"">bucket-brigade singing</a> idea in the
browser, and we couldn't find a fully worked echo example.  I now have
something that works, but it's kind of silly and it seems like there
must be a better way.

</p>

<p>

The way I would expect this to work with the (new, experimental, not
supported everywhere yet) Web Audio API is that you write an
AudioWorklet.  This is a way to set up JS to run off the main thread,
where number crunching won't block the UI and make the page
unresponsive.  I'd like to attach the worklet's input to the
microphone, output to the speaker, and that would be it.  Except, as
far as I can tell, there's no way to pipe the microphone directly to
an AudioWorklet.

</p>

<p>

To read audio samples from the user <a href=""https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/media/recording-audio#access_the_raw_data_from_the_microphone"">the
recommendation</a> is to make a <code>ScriptProcessorNode</code> and
give it an <code>audioprocess</code> callback.  This runs on the main
thread, though, and so when you look at MDN this is <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/BaseAudioContext/createScriptProcessor"">marked
as deprecated</a>.  It says to use <code>AudioWorklet</code> instead,
and I wish I could!

</p>

<p>

What I ended up doing was recording the audio on the main thread,
messaging that over to the worklet, and the having the worklet play
it.  Here's a demo, which relies on experimental Web Audio features
that so far are only implemented in Blink-based browsers: <a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/echo-demo"">echo-demo</a>.

I posted this as a comment a while back, but now I&apos;m making it a full post so I can find it again more easily.</p><p>The authors show that all of these have large effect sizes and are well replicated,  except where noted below. I notice that the authors cite themselves a  lot as support for many of these claims. I am not an expert in any of  this, so if they&apos;re trying to pass off controversial ideas as widely accepted, I wouldn&apos;t be able to see through it.</p><p>1. Significant genetic influence is ubiquitous in cognitive and psychological traits.  Intelligence has about 50% heritability. Twin studies show intelligence  correlation about 0.85 in identical twins vs 0.6 in fraternal twins.</p><p>2.  Although basically all psychological traits have some heritability (typically 30-50%) none of them have close to 100% heritability.  Contrast this with physical traits like height, which has about 90%  heritability.</p><p>3. Heritability of complex traits is caused by many genes of small effect that add up. Example: tendency for open-field activity in mice shows a linear response to selection pressure over 30 generations, rather than a clear separation that would occur if it were controlled by just a few genes.  &quot;Genome-wide association studies&quot; look at hundreds of thousands or millions of nucleotides covering most of the  genome to detect population associations between a single-nucleotide  polymorphism and a trait. It generally finds that even the most significant genetic changes by themselves have tiny effects (far less than 1% of variation).</p><p>4. Correlations between traits are usually caused largely by genetics. For example, the strong correlation between  types of intelligence (R=0.76 between reading and math) is due more to genetics than environment (the reading/math correlation is about 64% genetic). Anxiety and depression are correlated entirely for genetic  reasons (they are affected by all the same genes). The schizophrenia/bipolar connection is largely genetic too, as is neuroticism/depression. Another finding (not yet replicated) is that the  correlation of 0.3 between exercise behavior and attitudes toward exercise is 70% genetic; I interpret this to mean that most of the genetic influence on exercise behavior is caused by the influence of those same genes on attitudes toward exercise.</p><p>5.  Counterintuitively, heritability of intelligence increases linearly throughout development (from 41% at age 9 to 66% at age 17 in one twin study, and maybe as high as 80% in adulthood). </p><p>6. Stability of traits from age to age is largely due to genetics; changes that occur  with age are largely environmental. So then how does the heritability of  intelligence increase over time? The authors suggest &quot;genetic amplification&quot;: genetic nudges early in development get magnified as time goes by, perhaps due to genotype-environment correlation (kids choose or create environments that match their propensities). Some evidence supports this idea, but it may vary depending on the culture.  The authors do not seem to consider genetic amplification one of the  &quot;replicated findings&quot; noted in the title.</p><p>7. Most measures of the &apos;environment&apos; show significant genetic influence. This is a  generalization of the genotype-environment correlation mentioned above for  intelligence. Parenting, social support, and some life events seem to be causally affected by a child&apos;s genetics (not just correlated); this can be shown in twin studies. Same goes for school and work environments.  Heritability averages 0.27. This again varies with culture; parenting is more affected by the child&apos;s genetics in Japan than in Sweden. A child&apos;s genetics have even been shown to have some effect on the  family&apos;s socioeconomic status.</p><p>8.  Most associations between environmental measures and psychological traits are significantly mediated by genetics. Since genetic factors affect environmental  measures as well as behavioral measures, we should not assume that correlations between parenting and children&#x2019;s behavior are caused entirely by the environmental effect of parenting on children&#x2019;s  behavior. For instance, correlation between a child&apos;s developmental index and measures of their home environment is stronger for genetically related families (0.44) than adopted families (0.29). So, much of what  appears to be the effect of parenting on behavior is actually effect of the parents&apos; and child&apos;s shared genetics on both the behavior and the environment. Disentangling genetic and environmental influences is important because it allows us to tailor interventions more effectively.  </p><p>9. Most environmental effects are not shared by children growing up in the same family: salient experiences are specific to each child.  Similarity among siblings is mainly due to shared genetics. Non-shared environment has a bigger effect on phenotypic variance than shared environment does. Shared environment between siblings (including going to the same schools) accounts for 10-15% of variance in academic achievement. Shared environment&apos;s effect on intelligence decreases after  adolescence. Specific non-shared environmental effects are hard to identify, and are likely due to additive effects of many seemingly inconsequential experiences.</p><p>10. Abnormal is normal: quantitative genetic methods suggest that common psychological disorders are the  extremes of the same genetic factors responsible for heritability throughout the distribution. Reading disabilities, for instance, have been shown to have strong &quot;group heritability,&quot; indicating a genetic link between the disorder and normal variation in quantitative measures of reading ability. This is supported by the finding that many genes of small effect determine heritability of traits (finding 3); polygenic scores that sum these effects are normally distributed. An interesting exception involves severe intellectual disability (IQ &lt; 70), which this type of analysis suggests is etiologically distinct from the normal distribution of intelligence (no significant group heritability).</p><hr class=""dividerBlock""><p>The authors suggest that the above findings have replicated for reasons that are specific to the field of behavioral genetics, namely: </p><ul><li>The controversy of the nature/nurture debate has motivated bigger and better studies; </li><li>Behavioral genetics has historically used better statistical methods than much of psychology, partly because studies often have to be observational rather than experimental;</li><li>Focusing on the net effects of genetics and environment is more reliable than studying specific genes (polygenic scores work better); </li><li>There are better incentives and opportunities (data) for replications; </li><li>Because genetic effect sizes are larger than other factors studied in psychology (e.g. sex differences generally account for less than 1% of variance on  psychological traits). </li></ul><p>Many of these advantages cannot easily transfer to other fields.</p>",ErickBall,erickball,ErickBall,

Given what we knew prior about COVID-19 prior to Feb. 20th, when the market first started to decline, I felt that the stock market&apos;s reaction was delayed. And of course, there&apos;d been plenty of criticism of the response of experts and governments. But I was playing catch-up. I certainly was not screaming about COVID-19 until well after that time.</p><p>Today, I found <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic_data/International_medical_cases#New_cases_by_subcontinent,_country_and_territory"">the most detailed timeline I&apos;ve seen</a> of confirmed cases around the world. It goes day by day and country by country, from Jan. 13th to the end of March.</p><p>That timeline shows that Feb. 21st was the first date when at least 3 countries besides China had 10+ new confirmed cases in a single day (Japan, South Korea, Italy, and Iran).</p><p>That changes my interpretation of the stock market crash dramatically. Investors weren&apos;t failing to synthesize the early information or waiting for someone to yell &quot;fire!&quot; They were waiting to see confirmed international community spread, rather than just a few cases popping up here and there. Once they saw that early evidence, the sell-off began, and it continued in tandem, day by day, with the evidence of community spread in new countries and the exponential growth of COVID-19 cases in countries where it was already established.</p><p><a href=""https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4695"">Scott Aaronson speculates</a> that he might have been able to tell what COVID-19 would turn into on Feb. 4th. I believed and agreed with him, hypothesizing that it was a lack of intellectual guideposts for synthesizing early information on a novel disease that made it hard to assess and act appropriately. To correct that lack, I created a model for what to look<a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/QARHSMa6TqYz7txz3/alarm-bell-for-the-next-pandemic-v-2""> </a>for and how to interpret information to judge the potential spread of a disease - <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/QARHSMa6TqYz7txz3/alarm-bell-for-the-next-pandemic-v-2"">an alarm bell for the next pandemic</a>.</p><p>Now that I&apos;ve found day-by-day, country-by-country confirmed case data, I need to change a few of my points of view.</p><p>First, is lack of confirmed international community spread generally a good reason to not panic, even if in this case things turned out badly? COVID-19 had its first confirmed case in the USA on Jan. 21st, but never had more than 1-2 new cases on any given day until Feb. 29th - with several days up to 12 days in between new cases during that time. That&apos;s over a month of sporadic, occasional new case reports.</p><p>The coincidence of faster spread of COVID-19 internationally and the beginnings of the stock market crash suggest that hard evidence of community spread of a deadly disease is the world&apos;s evidential benchmark for an economic downturn.</p><p>And that seems perfectly reasonable to me.</p><p>To argue otherwise is to say that it should be obvious COVID-19 was highly contagious based on some other form of evidence. That&apos;s not impossible.</p><p>But in my case, I didn&apos;t know until weeks after I started researching that the world&apos;s largest encyclopedia had day-by-day, country-by-country confirmed case data.</p><p>So it&apos;s really not a stretch for an amateur such as myself to have missed or misinterpreted some critically important source of data. I still think it&apos;s possible for an avid, early COVID-19 amateur researcher to have felt reasonably confident in shorting the market prior to Feb. 20th. But they&apos;d need to have searched <em>long and hard </em>for other forms of data to back up their argument. Not only evaluating COVID-19 on its own terms, but comparing it with other pandemics of the late 20th and early 21st century.</p><p>So I have to downgrade my confidence in the usefulness of the models I wrote for this. I need to call myself out on my willingness to assume with such confidence that the world had it wrong, rather than me. Maybe this experience has been necessary for my intellectual growth. Doing this research out of curiosity and being willing to accept my own conclusions, even when I ultimately felt I was mostly wrong, was perhaps the only way to get to this point of understanding, to get less wrong.</p><p>On a deeper level, I am learning and relearning a fundamental lesson lately. I don&apos;t anticipate that I&apos;ll have grasped it until it&apos;s bashed me over the head at least a few more times. Here it is, in free verse:</p><p>Intellectual knowledge is a slippery thing.</p><p>I can&apos;t readily grasp it.</p><p>I don&apos;t practice engaging with it every waking moment, the way I do with my five senses.</p><p>Human intellect is 2% of the evolutionary age of the nervous system.</p><p>This kind of intellectual work is extremely difficult; only a few people care about it enough to make the attempt, so I&apos;m getting far less feedback than I would for other activities.</p><p>I am no savant.</p><p>Others have been doing this full-time for decades longer than I&apos;ve spent as a part-time amateur.</p><p>A major league baseball player who hits a home run has far more in common with an MLB player who hits a foul ball than a child who hits a home run.</p><p>Reliable knowledge is a hard-won and precious thing.</p>",AllAmericanBreakfast,directedevolution,DirectedEvolution,

Sometimes I tell the kids ""sorry, I can't do that with you right now,
I'm writing a blog post"".  A few months ago Lily (then 5y) came up to
me and asked if I would help her write a post.  We sat down on the
couch, she dictated, I typed, and out came a </span>

<a href=""https://www.lilywise.com/bridges"">post about bridges</a>.  Since
then she's asked me to record 

<a href=""https://www.lilywise.com/about"">about a dozen</a> more.

</p>

<p>

Some of the posts are fully initiated by her (<a href=""https://www.lilywise.com/podcasts"">podcasts</a>) but other times
I'll ask if she'd like to write one with me.  Perhaps we've just done
something interesting together (<a href=""https://www.lilywise.com/experiments"">static and balloons</a>),
or maybe she has something she wants to tell people about (<a href=""https://www.lilywise.com/tricky"">tricky situations with my sister</a>).



</p>

<p>

First she'll dictate the post body, then I'll ask about a title, then
I'll ask about colors.  Sometimes her color preferences can be a bit
much, and I kind of regret <a href=""https://www.lilywise.com/amusement"">learning the CSS for
polka-dotted backgrounds</a>.  I'll ask if she wants any pictures on
the post, and we'll either look through my photo archive or go take a
picture of something.  I'll usually take pictures during activities if
I think there's a chance she'll want to use a picture in a post; at
some point that kind of anticipation will be her job, but not yet.

</p>

<p>

When it's done I'll date it and add it to the <a href=""https://www.lilywise.com/about"">index page</a>.  Lily will often
ask me to post it in the <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/groups/2264685517005985/"">Anna and
Lily</a> Facebook group.  Yesterday she wrote something and wanted to
post it to <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/"">LessWrong</a> so more
people would see it.  I expected she wouldn't get the same kind of
reception there as on Facebook, but I helped her make <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/users/lilywise"">an account</a>.  She
had trouble deciding what she wanted to write, though, and didn't end
up posting anything.

</p>

<p>

Her younger sister Anna has written <a href=""https://www.annakaufmanwise.com/about"">several</a> as well,
though her attention span is a lot shorter and the posts are less
coherent.  She clearly misses her cousins a lot.

<p>A little over a week ago I started writing up my general thinking about Covid-19. I then ended up pulling out from that post first <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2020/04/10/the-one-mistake-rule/"">The One Mistake Rule</a> and then <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2020/04/11/seemingly-popular-covid-19-model-is-obvious-nonsense/"">Seemingly Popular Covid-19 Model is Obvious Nonsense</a>. I did not get back to finishing the post, and it’s now been a week.</p>
<p>In Covid-19 terms, a week is a long time. Rather than continue where I left off, I’ll restart and change styles. The goal here is to get thoughts down on paper and share them, in hopes they are useful, and not lose too much more to the huge speed premium these days. Can always follow up later.</p>
<p>This is built upon the same type of thinking as <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2020/04/07/on-r0/"">On R0</a> and <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2020/04/01/taking-initial-viral-load-seriously/"">Taking Initial Viral Load Seriously</a>. Its conclusions are broadly consistent with On R0.</p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p>If anything, the past week has been <em>surprisingly unsurprising. </em>I would characterize what we have seen this past week as mostly the good news we would have expected given there was going to be good news, plus a large reporting bump around Easter.</p>
<p>All the numbers are terrible and unreliable and flirt with being meaningless. But the numbers also mostly fit together at this point into a coherent story of what is happening.</p>
<p>This post is an attempt to lay out what I think is happening, and likely to happen, and explain the thinking behind that. I’ve laid it out in conversations with many people I trust, and incorporated their models and feedback. I mostly seem to be able to convince these people that my picture is broadly reasonable.</p>
<p>This is not intended as a proof of any kind, nor am I going to attempt to provide all the sources that shaped my conclusions – better to get the information out there than to let perfect be the enemy of the good. Early on I did the opposite, kept quiet, and that was clearly a mistake.</p>
<h3>How I Read Data at This Point</h3>
<p>Different people have different views on what data is accurate, what data is meaningful, and what data is useless.</p>
<p>My starting assumption is that essentially no one is <em>outright lying </em>or putting down imaginary numbers. When you see a number it is the product of a process that observes something in the physical world and reports back. That does not mean that the number means what it says it means.</p>
<p>We know that the number of positive test results, on its own, not very useful once you have other data. Positive test numbers, on their own, primarily tell you how many tests are being run.</p>
<p>Number of tests being run tells you how much testing we’re doing, which is worth knowing. More would be better.</p>
<p>The <em>percentage of tests that are positive</em> is highly useful. I consider this to often be the best tool available.</p>
<p>Knowing how to interpret that number depends, of course, on the method of choosing who gets tested. The hope is that this method is roughly constant over time, except for variation in how many tests are available and how many people are how sick. Across different locations this is <em>not </em>a good assumption, but within a single location it seems like it probably mostly is a good assumption. Even across locations, it’s almost always going to mostly be some form of first testing health care workers and others with priority (which is a roughly similar group in most places), then people who need the test to determine hospital treatment, then others.</p>
<p>The tests being used are mostly only sensitive during a short window. If you take the test too early or too late, you’ll come back negative. There’s also a substantial pure false negative rate, but a very small false positive rate. I’m building in something like a 25% false negative rate for actually positive-right-now patients.</p>
<p>Effectively, there seems to be a cap at or slightly above 50% on what percentage of tests will ever be positive. Which makes sense – if you could pick out a 90%+ positive sample without doing any tests, you almost don’t need to run the tests, and there are substantial numbers of false negatives or people who take the test outside their response window.</p>
<p>What that means to me is that, once we get to 50% or so positive rate, the numbers stop meaning much. Tests tell us about individual patients but they don’t tell us about how many people are infected beyond telling us that number is above a threshold that is a function of our testing rate. Until we drop down again, that’s all we know.</p>
<p>It’s not clear exactly how lagged the positive test data is, since lab delays and delays before getting a test at all vary a lot, and there’s even dispute over the time it takes to show symptoms. The delay seems clearly at least one week, and might be as high as two weeks.</p>
<p>Then we have death data. The death data can be assumed on average to lag infections by roughly three weeks according to what I have seen, with a lot of noise attached.</p>
<p>The bigger problem is that death data mostly only counts confirmed positive cases that then die. In practice, this means that if you die in a hospital you are counted, if you die in a nursing home you might be counted, and if you die in your house you probably won’t be counted.</p>
<p>Thus, <em>if hospitals are not above capacity, </em>death data is good but lagged, although you need to adjust it for the health of the infected population, the quality of care and testing, and so on, if you want to backtrack to infections.</p>
<p>Even in the best of places, this will be an undercount – this effect is much, much bigger than any unjustified ascribing of Covid-19 deaths to people who die of other things while also having Covid-19.</p>
<p>However, <em>if hospitals are above capacity, </em>the death data stops meaning anything beyond establishing a minimum baseline. This happened in Iran, Italy and Spain, and in New York City. If more people died, the death counts that were reported would not change much if at all, unless it caused other things to change. Italy’s undercount of deaths seems clearly massive. New York City claims theirs is at least 40% or so. Given the state of New York’s medical care I’m guessing that is if anything low.</p>
<p>This means that we enter a kind of dead zone once things get sufficiently bad. First we lose our test data, then we lose our death data and are left blind. We only learn where we are when numbers drop substantially from where they peaked. Then we can attempt to figure out where we were prior to that.</p>
<p>We can also use our knowledge of what physical behaviors people were doing at various times, create a model of what that implies in terms of doubling times given a serial interval of roughly 5 days (see <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2020/04/07/on-r0/"">On R0</a>). That especially gets combined with observed <em>changes </em>in the death and positive test rates at various points in time.</p>
<p>Here I include a <em>much faster than generally assumed </em>drop-off in R0 based on the percentage already infected. Who gets infected is very non-random. The amount of exposure each person gets seems best approximated by a power law. The amount you are exposed to infection by others, and the amount you expose others to infection, are very highly correlated. To make conservative (to me) statements, I would be surprised if the first 10% infected reduced the forward-looking infection rate much less than 30%. I would be very surprised if the first 50% didn’t cut infection rates by &gt;75%.</p>
<p>Lock down conditions probably make these contrasts even stronger, since a lot of people’s exposure profile drops close to zero out of household, while others are forced to or choose to accept a lot of exposure. Lock down conditions also seem like they <em>have to, </em>as discussed in On R0, get rid of the vast majority of the vast majority of exposure sources, especially once there’s been enough time to work through secondary household infections from pre-lock down infections.</p>
<p>The infection fatality rate, and the asymptomatic infection rate, are also importantly unknown even under a fixed set of conditions (patients with a given age distribution and level of co-morbidity, and a known level of care). It is another set of variables that one needs to vary as needed in order to make everything make sense – we have a bunch of equations that have to hold.</p>
<p>I have been using a soft upper bound on the IFR of 1% in cases where the hospitals have not fully collapsed. My guess is that it’s lower than that, and my best guess is more like 0.3%-0.5%, but that is based on a ton of different things pulling in different directions.</p>
<p>Combine it all, find the versions that seem non-absurd, and that’s the range of plausible situations.</p>
<h3>Where Is The Data?</h3>
<p>I have decided to use the data from <a href=""https://covidtracking.com/data/us-daily"">Covid Tracking Project</a>. They seem to have good data in nice form and reliably update. It’s important to be consistent and this allows that.</p>
<p>I look at positive test numbers, negative test numbers and deaths, and then do basic math on them. I gather the data into this spreadsheet for easy viewing and calculations. <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fG6Egvt6-h9DwYBXwAVHGT_gIznoYrvpcWjOT_jZmrc/edit?usp=sharing"">Here is a link.</a> You can look but not edit.</p>
<p>There are often obvious errors or random things in the data. Mostly I just leave them there, but am starting to try and note it and do what I can when I see them, such as when New Jersey spent a day only reporting positive tests on 4/14 (or they forgot to copy the number into the spreadsheet), or when California reported tons of negative tests all at once on 4/3.</p>
<p>I’ve decided to break out “New York State plus New Jersey” as the epicenter that is distinct from the rest of the country. New Jersey’s situation is quite bad, and it makes sense to me to treat it as effectively a part of New York here. This leads to my numbers being slightly different than the numbers you’ll see discussed elsewhere, since almost no one else is doing the same exact calculation.</p>
<h3>How Are Things Going in New York and New Jersey?</h3>
<p>If we smooth out 3/28 with 3/29, NY/NJ hit the test positive rate maximum on 3/28. If not, we hit on 3/30. From there until 4/6, rate was steadily between 46% and 50.9% each day. One could argue the decline starts on 4/2, if we want to look at small changes. Starting on 4/7, positive rate has been under 46% each day. Starting on 4/12 it has been under 44% each day. On 4/14 and 4/16 it was under 40% for the first time in weeks. No matter how the numbers are plotted, it is clear the news is good.</p>
<p>On 4/1 I made my guess that that day was the peak in marginal infections in New York City. That now seems like the late end of a several day range of possible peaks.</p>
<p>That is very consistent with New York fully locking down on 3/22, and the peak coming several days later once secondary household infections had time to play out.</p>
<p>Deaths lag infections by three weeks. NY/NJ death counts have been almost entirely flat from 4/7 until 4/16 when this was written. That corresponds to infection times of about 3/19 to 3/28.</p>
<p>The earliest plausible time for new infections to have peaked was 3/22 itself, for obvious reasons. That would correspond to a six day delay in test reporting. In the three days before that it looks like test positive results went from ~30% to ~50%, and New York doubling times before lock down in general look like they were well under three days.</p>
<p>Thus, the ‘good’ scenario for New York would be that there was one final doubling after 3/19 (e.g. after the death rate hit its current observed rate, which maxes out the hospitals). Then New York started declining, but has not yet dropped a full 50% back to 3/19 as of at least 4/10 or so, since more tests yielded a higher positive rate through the 4/16 data.</p>
<p>If we take the death peak as roughly the same as the number of deaths that would have resulted from good medical care, and state that as a 1% IFR, that seems like a lower bound on infections at the time. On April 9 three weeks later, deaths in New York State were counted at 7,067. Thus we would get 700,000 infections in NYS on March 19, 1.4 million on March 22. If we get steady decline in new infection rate from there, by 4/17 we still have 26 additional days at more than half that rate, so at least that many infections every 5 days, or 5 more times, for 4.9 million infected out of 19 million residents, or a roughly 25% statewide infection rate. You can lower that a bit, or at the upper end you can go up to and including hitting saturation (50%+) without making any assumptions that seem impossible. New York City would then be substantially higher the state, and you adjust for the undercount and for your preferred IFR.</p>
<p>If we used today’s official death state count of 12,192, assume 1% IFR (if the official death counts are close to right, it means hospitals were barely ever overwhlemed) and back out 21 days, then ask about plausible rate of infection from there given Cuomo’s official estimate of R0=0.9, and serial interval of 5. Again, this is us living in ‘official world.’ So we have four serial intervals, we can assume previously half of people got infected last interval (600k) and then we can generously drop that 10% each time. That should give us a hard lower bound (short of rejecting that IFR). So we get roughly 2.4 million infected, or 12%, plus whatever you think the undercount is on death totals.</p>
<p>Zucker, in a Cuomo briefing, said he thought 10%-20% infected two days ago. Something like 10%-40% for the state, 15%-60% for NYC seems like a reasonable range of possible worlds. The higher end involves a less deadly virus, but if that’s true then I don’t see how we avoid infection rates that look super high.</p>
<p>At that point, things start to self correct and burn out. We should see a steady drop in R0, unless there’s something pushing back against it via a different selection effect. That seems unlikely. The very fact that we didn’t see a big decline yet, only a modest one, in turn points towards things having been far<em> </em>out of the measurable range at least briefly.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2009316"">Another sanity check</a>, the only NYC testing data point I could find that is a remotely random sample:</p>
<blockquote><p>Between March 22 and April 4, 2020, a total of 215 pregnant women delivered infants at the New York–Presbyterian Allen Hospital and Columbia University Irving Medical Center . All the women were screened on admission for symptoms of Covid-19. Four women (1.9%) had fever or other symptoms of Covid-19 on admission, and all 4 women tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (<span><a href=""https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2009316#"">Figure 1</a></span>). Of the 211 women without symptoms, all were afebrile on admission. Nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained from 210 of the 211 women (99.5%) who did not have symptoms of Covid-19; of these women, 29 (13.7%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Thus, 29 of the 33 patients who were positive for SARS-CoV-2 at admission (87.9%) had no symptoms of Covid-19 at presentation.</p></blockquote>
<p>Presumably late stage pregnant women tend to go outside much less under normal conditions than others, and even less on a relative basis under pandemic conditions, and thus are much less exposed. The case against is perhaps they have large household size and their other kids mean they’re more exposed, especially before the schools closed. And of course, they’re a pretty young group, which is less susceptible, and also females get the virus less. Could in theory go either way but I have a hard time imagining women nine months pregnant not in general being far safer than the population. Also, this study was in The Bronx area, which is relatively poor, which could limit ability to stay home.</p>
<p>It’s possible they visited doctors offices for checkups and caught it there? But I would assume they would mostly do everything to not do that during the previous few weeks, and before that it was safe to go. Some effect, I guess.</p>
<p>Still, we see a 13.7% positive rate on the test via swabs, which means something like 25% false negative, so <em>at the time </em>we get 17% of the asymptomatic women positive, 19% overall positive. There isn’t that big a window to test positive, and even less of one to do so while asymptomatic. If we believe this result at all, it’s <em>really hard </em>not to get a <em>very, very high </em>number for infection rates in NYC. If 19% are infected during one window, the total number now has to be more than double that, likely a lot more than double.</p>
<p>Given these numbers, New York and New Jersey should be able to reopen in mid-May or certainly in June. Maybe things are hovering around 0.9 now, but we’re rapidly building herd immunity, so that number should drop substantially week by week. As that happens things can start returning to the new normal, if allowed to by Cuomo. I expect people to mostly keep taking strong precautions when their living conditions allow it, and I expect those whose conditions do not allow it to have the virus burn through those areas quickly.</p>
<p>In general, this ‘stuck in limbo where we’re able with all our effort to just barely win’ thing doesn’t really parse for me. It’s <em>possible, </em>but it’s a strange coincidence, and it’s only stable with low infection rate bases. So it’s more possible to get stuck in limbo as California, but I don’t buy it for New York.</p>
<p>I expect to emotionally feel personally safe here within between one and three months, with the upper range of that being a mix of some things go slow and some failure to have appropriate emotions.</p>
<h3>How About Everywhere Else in America?</h3>
<p>Tons of regional differences, of course, that I’m going to mostly ignore because I’m not looking at them all that carefully.</p>
<p><a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2020/04/11/seemingly-popular-covid-19-model-is-obvious-nonsense/"">As I explained previously</a>, the model that says the worst is behind America and we’ll top out at 60k deaths doesn’t make sense. <a href=""https://www.statnews.com/2020/04/17/influential-covid-19-model-uses-flawed-methods-shouldnt-guide-policies-critics-say/"">Another amusing take down</a> has now been written of the same model, which contains gems like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>The chief reason the IHME projections worry some experts, Etzioni said, is that “the fact that they overshot” — initially projecting up to 240,000 U.S. deaths, compared with fewer than 70,000 now — “will be used to suggest that the government response prevented an even greater catastrophe, when in fact the predictions were shaky in the first place.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Which is a <em>really rich </em>thing to complain about, changing one’s projections as new data comes in, as opposed to having a number and sticking with it. We are all so doomed.</p>
<p>A much better point they make would be this one:</p>
<blockquote><p>Even the predictions of daily deaths “have been highly inaccurate,” said statistician Sally Cripps of the University of Sydney, who led a team that examined IHME’s up-and-down projections. “It performs poorly even when it predicts the number of next-day deaths: The true number of next-day deaths has been outside the 95% intervals 70% of the time.” If the 95% calculation correctly reflects a model’s uncertainty, then textbook statistics say the true numbers can fall outside that range no more than 5% of the time.</p></blockquote>
<p>Your 95% confidence interval for the next day <em>really, really </em>should be able to get more than half of the data points. We’d like to have <em>some </em>standards. Ideally more like 95%, but if it’s 30%, consider that maybe you have a problem.</p>
<p>All the models are bad. Which isn’t unreasonable, modeling this is super hard and it’s not like I can offer a robust one in return here. If I had more time and some help, and especially if I thought people would then listen, I would try to make all this more formal and accurate.</p>
<p>In any case, let’s ask what’s happening out there. Again, we have deaths and we have infections.</p>
<p>Deaths clearly had an artificial drop around Easter, which may have shifted extra deaths forward. So it’s not crazy to say just from the death data that we’re looking at roughly 2000/day for the last six days, or 1000/day without NY/NJ, and the trend isn’t obvious and definitely isn’t exponential. Seems fair as a first step before looking at infections. We certainly can’t claim any sort of decline, but maybe things aren’t getting worse.</p>
<p>Using what for now is Column X, % positive rate ex-NY ex-NJ, we see the peak was on 4/1 to 4/3. Then something weird happened with the data reporting and a whole bunch of negative tests got dumped out by California and generally we had a low tide for a few days. It’s likely that these two events represent time-shifted reports in some form. Seems too early in any case, based on what was happening at the time. 4/8 to 4/13 seems mostly stable, as are the test counts. Then there’s a distinct drop on 4/14-15 to 12.0% and 12.6%, but then on 4/16 it’s back to 14.2%.</p>
<p>In a few days, we’ll know whether that’s a blip in a good trend or there isn’t much of a trend at all. The weekend should cause a substantial update no matter what happens. Nothing much is changing out there, so whatever conditions exist are continuing to exist, at least for now.</p>
<p>The good scenario is that things peaked around 4/1-4/5 in terms of new infections, and they’re on a slow downward trend now in most or all places. There’s a lot more room here for either regional variation, or for us to by coincidence be just below 1 on R0. We could see a peak early next week at something like 2500 deaths in a day, then slow declines.</p>
<p>The bad scenario is that this represents various logistical failures of allocation and implementation, and places good at testing doing a lot of tests that are increasingly negative while places bad at testing do a few tests that more of which are positive, and things aren’t getting better. Or at least, aren’t getting better in a few key places. Potentially we outright fail even while trying, or more likely at least some regions give up.</p>
<p>What’s the plausible range of infection rates?</p>
<p>Again, the USA overall has 30,209 reported deaths as of this morning (4/17), roughly 15,000 ex-NY/NJ. Again, we assume an undercount. We back track that three weeks.</p>
<p>At best the peak is about one doubling from then, at 3 million infections, then we maintain slightly less than that pace from there and we get something like 6 million, or 2% infected. The path down will be slower than the path up, but we could be already somewhat down from peak, so maybe we can get away with this being the halfway point in infections now on 4/17 and have the death toll around 120k outside of the epicenter? Again, as an optimistic scenario but not quite the absolute most optimistic. And of course, maybe we find (by which I mean, we confirm way too slowly and then way too slowly actually use) better treatments, in which case IFR drops and less people die. That certainly seems possible.</p>
<p>It’s also very possible for this to be a large undercount even if IFR doesn’t change. I find it plausible that a lot of places are in crisis but not testing much and missing a ton of deaths as well, and things have been building in such places for a while by now.</p>
<p>A 5% infection rate wouldn’t be surprising to me. I would be surprised but wouldn’t be shocked by a 10% overall infection rate, but of course that would imply a lower IFR. More than that seems unlikely. If it was true, then NYC would have already hit herd immunity and the numbers would be crashing, and we’d see the same in Italy and Spain, but we don’t.</p>
<h3>What Happens From Here?</h3>
<p>I want to wrap this up so I don’t lose even more to the speed premium, so I don’t have time to give my full thoughts on this today. In <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2020/04/07/on-r0/"">On R0</a> and throughout this I should be making clear what I think the physical landscape looks like. This will all be the same picture I gave then, just more explicit/direct/compact.</p>
<p>Over time, people get better at reducing risk while not sacrificing too much to do so. Masks get worn and improved in type and quality, delivery services scale, people stop acting like 6.1 feet is safe and 5.9 feet will kill you (seriously, this one stings every time), companies implement temperature checks and new workplace designs, the people who aren’t with the program learn the program, and so on. Testing will expand eventually, including by corporations supplying for their employees. People who are immune are placed in exposed positions increasingly with antibody testing, and even those without testing in those positions have mostly have been infected anyway at this point if they have been unable to take good precautions.</p>
<p>There is pushing back from people sick of distancing and who need to go work and earn a living, but they mostly do so in sensible ways. There’s some risk of crazy town if things are handled badly. So far only Michigan and Ohio show signs of it I’ve heard about, which is likely because Ohio reacted so well that people don’t get why they had to, and Michigan reacted poorly and people are mad about the implementation details being terrible.</p>
<p>Some areas are not set up to handle things well. In those areas, things get briefly bad, but they also burn out relatively quickly. Can’t handle it translates into particular groups being unable to handle things or choosing not to, so those groups burn through infections until they’re handling it.</p>
<p>I do think that there’s a lot of slack for private agents to step up and help a lot more, but it’s currently illegal to do so. When there is need of it, it will happen. Corporations and individual people have come out of all this looking really good.</p>
<p>Trump will continue to do his best to screw things up, and it will continue to screw things up, but I expect this to not be in ways that matter that much in the big picture. The real damage done was already done early on. He’s done an admirable job of not trying to actually do things, except for some banditry and piracy involving medical equipment. Could have been a lot worse. He briefly flirted with saying he had absolute authority, but backed down as is his pattern before we started once again saying “The United States are” and I don’t expect him to try again in a serious way.</p>
<p>We “reopen” the country in places in mid-May and others in June or July, but that doesn’t mean open. It means people are free to do what they want. Schools mostly or entirely won’t reopen this semester, so places that ‘open’ will still be largely closed slash in the new normal as we adjust. Mostly things shut down because private citizens and corporations shut them down, and they’ll reopen the same way. If Cuomo “reopened” New York I doubt much of anything would actually change the next few weeks.</p>
<p>Likely by end of year we’ve found a treatment protocol that makes this all a lot less deadly. I’m guessing combining the stuff we’ve already found that works and tossing the parts that doesn’t would do a lot.</p>
<p>The supply chain looks like it’s straining in places, and needs deregulation of the food supply so people can pivot to residential provision faster. My guess is things get somewhat worse for a bit, then this is allowed to happen slash people find workarounds as some restaurants become de facto grocery stores. When it gets bad we’ll figure it out quickly.</p>
<p>Eventually there’s a vaccine and it all finally ends.</p>
<p>What would I bet on right now, as one commentator asked? I don’t really want to bet on such matters, especially I don’t feel good about betting on more people dying. But certainly I’d bet against the things I think are essentially can’t happens, given reasonable odds. More detail is needed to know what else I would do; trading is very context dependent.</p>
<p>All right, that’s where I’m at right now. I’d prefer to learn and expand on this with debates and conversations on phones and video chats rather than comments, so I don’t plan on engaging much in the comments, but don’t let that discourage you from saying things.</p>

Most people seem to agree that curiosity is a useful intrinsic motivator for research at the macro level. And discussions I've seen make a strong case for curiosity working better as a motivation for research at the macro-level than other potential motivators - status, prestige, etc. But, every time I read or think about this, I've felt this nagging unease that I only just managed to pinpoint the source of. My unease comes from my uncertainty about <strong>how much curiosity can drive act as a single source of motivation to do day-to-day work in the absence of ""discipline"".</strong></p>
<p>Personally, as I mentioned in a comment on <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/tTD8fbctGhH26Jahp/curiosity-a-greedy-feeling"">this post</a>, I haven't found that curiosity on its provides sufficient motivation for me to continue making progress on work day after day. Even for work I'm genuinely interested in, there tend to be parts that are more and less interesting, so I still need to employ <a href=""https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2015/09/29/deep-habits-three-recent-daily-plans/"">daily scheduling</a> to make continuous progress.</p>
<p>However, I'm a nobody, and famous thinkers like Richard Feynman talk about how they're motivated by the <a href=""https://learning.media.mit.edu/courses/mas713/readings/Finding_Things_Out.pdf"">pleasure of finding things out</a> and getting <a href=""https://www.asc.ohio-state.edu/kilcup.1/262/feynman.html"">unstuck by playing</a>. I love Feynman as much as the next person, but am wary of over-updating on his example or the public persona of any eminent thinker for that matter.</p>
<p>So instead, I'm curious to hear from people here: how much are you able to motivate yourself day-to-day via curiosity? Does this motivation substitute for scheduling / planning or complement it? Bonus points for discussing what your work tends to be and whether there are certain parts of it that you are more / less motivated to by curiosity.</p>

He runs his own <a href=""https://goodjudgment.com/insights/"">consulting firm</a>. The information he&apos;s selling is not available to the public. How would he do it in a way that isn&apos;t violating any of the rules he&apos;s set up for forecasting?</p><p>I&apos;m not saying he is, not at all. I respect Tetlock greatly, admire the work he&apos;s done, and seek to learn from it. In fact, it&apos;s in the spirit he brings to his enterprise that I&apos;m questioning it. After all, his work is based on calling out the wiggle room &quot;expert&quot; commentators give themselves, and trying to get rid of it. I&apos;m examining whether there might yet be a little bit of wiggle room left in the system.</p><p><strong>How superforecasting could be manipulated</strong></p><p>My understanding is that Tetlock designates as superforecasters the top 2% of participants in his tournaments. He evaluates their accuracy to see whether it stays steady or regresses to the mean, and finds that superforecasters really are better than the average person at predicting complex world events.</p><p>In theory, the way the system could be manipulated is in the selection of questions.</p><p>Superforecasters are eventually set apart from regular forecasters. For example, the questions answered at Good Judgment, Tetlock&apos;s professional consulting firm, are not visible to the public. I have to assume they&apos;re not (all) mirrored at <a href=""https://www.gjopen.com/"">Good Judgment Open</a>, his open-to-all platform for forecasting. Hence, no way for even a client to compare how superforecasters do on these questions compared to the average Joanne.</p><p>How could their accuracy be inflated, even while answering unambiguous questions and being evaluated in a purely algorithmic fashion?</p><p>By choosing primarily questions that are in fact easy to answer for a professional, yet appear difficult to the typical client.</p><p>Here are two versions of the same question:</p><blockquote>&quot;Will Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un meet on or before Dec. 31, 2020?&quot;</blockquote><blockquote>&quot;Will Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un meet <em>in Seoul</em> on or before Dec. 31, 2020?&quot;</blockquote><p>Most readers here are savvy enough to realize that the odds of these world leaders meeting in Seoul are lower than them meeting at all, and familiar enough with the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunction_fallacy"">conjunction fallacy</a> to know that &quot;in Seoul&quot; may actually make the second version seem more plausible to some readers. A professional superforecaster (or question writer for a global risk analysis firm) would know that Seoul, being the capital of South Korea, is an unlikely location for a next meeting place for Dear Leader. So by positing this question, you give the superforecasters an easy A.</p><p>Include a large number of these seems-hard-but-actually-easy questions, and you can inflate the average accuracy of your team. Include a few genuinely tough questions, like the <a href=""https://www.eurasiagroup.net/live-post/superforecaster-fridays-total-cases-coronavirus-reported-who-20-march-2020"">number of Coronavirus cases</a> in a month&apos;s time, and when your team gets them right, you can trumpet it. When they get other truly uncertain questions wrong, well, you can&apos;t get them all.</p><p>I want to reiterate that I am <em>not</em> accusing Tetlock or any other group of forecasters of doing this, consciously or unconsciously. In fact, on their analytics page, Good Judgment advertises that clients can choose the questions:</p><blockquote>Clients... can... pose their own questions to the Superforecasters... And, if we don&apos;t have your topic on our current subscription list, our expert question team will help frame your mission-critical questions to get the answers you need.</blockquote><p>GJ might do this with perfect integrity. And clients using this service have an incentive to pose questions where an increase in accuracy has genuine value.</p><p>But an unscrupulous firm might get a lot of practice at the additional skill of guiding clients to frame questions that appear uncertain but are in fact easy to answer. If the incentives of those hiring the consulting firm diverge from the overall interests of the company - if those purchasing the analytics aren&apos;t directly invested in getting answers to the most pressing questions - if the object at the level of the transaction is to have reassuringly advanced methodology backing up your report - then heck, maybe it&apos;s <em>in the interests of the client, </em>as in whichever manager is doing the hiring, to have the consultant spit back a bunch of highly confident answers that almost all turn out to be objectively accurate. It makes it really easy to defend your choice of analytics firm later on.</p><p><strong>Testing calibration is not a fix</strong></p><p>After Nate Silver sort-of failed to predict Trump&apos;s Presidential win, he <a href=""https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/when-we-say-70-percent-it-really-means-70-percent/"">checked to see whether his predictions are well-calibrated</a>. Turns out, he is. When he predicts an event has a 70% chance of occurring (rounded to the nearest 5%), 71% of the time, it does.</p><p>If an unscrupulous forecasting firm wanted to hack this, could they?</p><p>Let&apos;s say they have a batch of 100 questions. 99 are easy questions - so unlikely that on each of them, the superforecasters predict the event has a 1% chance of occurring. One, though, is a hard question, with a 50% chance, a coin flip.</p><p>All they have to do is predict that the hard question also has a 1% chance of occurring. Without the hard question, they might have gotten 1-2 questions wrong, maybe even 3. With the hard question, they now have a 50% chance of getting one more question wrong. Even with some bad luck, when they predict a 1% chance of an event occurring, it actually occurs 4% of the time. And doesn&apos;t that still look pretty darn good?</p><p><strong>Why this matters</strong></p><p>First, it suggests to me that if the superforecasting system can be hacked in this way, then we&apos;re back to square one. We are trusting an accuracy assessment of experts that is manipulable. It might be more difficult to manipulate than that of the pundits who never really forecast anything. But at least with the pundits, we know to be suspicious.</p><p>The superforecasters still have an aura of Truth about them. It can get to the point where if we find that our analysis disagrees with the superforecasters, we are inclined to doubt ourselves almost automatically, with a similar sort of fundamentalism that we might subscribe to the efficient market hypothesis.</p><p>The advantage we amateurs have is that we&apos;re likely to pick questions with high uncertainty and high importance. Why would I bother looking around for questions I can easily guess the answer to, unless I was trying to impress other people with my clairvoyance?</p><p>I don&apos;t think a good strategy is to accuse other people of using this strategy to artificially inflate their accuracy score. But it&apos;s hard for me to imagine this isn&apos;t already happening as the superforecasting meme spreads.</p><p>I&apos;m not sure I have a well-drawn-out way to deal with this, but here are the sketches.</p><p>If someone posts a list of their predictions, you choose the ones from their list that you personally feel the most uncertain about. Make a public, dated statement that those are your uncertainties. When the questions are resolved, calibrate their accuracy based only on the questions that you had genuine uncertainty about.</p><p>A better way, of course, would be to submit that question to a formal forecasting tournament, and see whether the median prediction was closer to 1% or 99% (highly unlikely/likely), or closer to 50% (highly uncertain). But that&apos;s not typically tractable.</p><p>Betting is also an OK strategy, but the failure mode there is that if you can make up your own questions, then find an idiot to bet with, you can accomplish the same thing. It only really works if an outsider would respect both people involved. I do respect <a href=""https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/030916/buffetts-bet-hedge-funds-year-eight-brka-brkb.asp"">Warren Buffett&apos;s bet with Prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; Partners LLC</a> about the relative long-term performance of an index fund vs. a hedge fund, because it was high-profile, with not just financial but reputational stakes for both involved.</p><p>I do plan, personally, on being on watch against people putting on airs because of the <em>sheer number</em> of correct predictions they&apos;ve made. Based on this, I&apos;m downgrading my heuristic for interpreting superforecaster predictions to &quot;soft evidence&quot; unless I can see their models and evidence, or can find some other way to evaluate whether the overall system they&apos;re participating is really being run with integrity.</p><p>In the end, it&apos;s a choice between believing the reason and evidence you can personally evaluate, and accepting a consulting firm&apos;s analysis because of what the CEO tells you about how they run the company. If you&apos;re in a long-term relationship with the consultants, maybe you can get a sense of whether they&apos;re steering you right over the long run. But when superforecasters predicted a 3% chance of 200,000 Coronavirus cases by mid-March, maybe it&apos;s time to downgrade our confidence in superforecasters, rather than in ourselves.</p>",AllAmericanBreakfast,directedevolution,DirectedEvolution,

Here's a way to play Settlers of Catan with two players that </span>

<a href=""http://www.davidchudzicki.com/"">David</a> and I worked out this
weekend.  We've only played one game with it so far, and didn't think
very hard about tradeoffs, so there are probably better ways to do it.



<ul>

<li><p>Set up the board as normal.</p></li>
<li><p>Each player controls two colors.  We did white/blue and
red/orange.</p></li>
<li><p>Placement is A B B' A' A' B' B A</p></li>
<li><p>Turns aren't color specific, except that you can only build for
one color on a turn.</p></li>
<li><p>If you own a port with either color you can fully use it on
your turn.</p></li>
<li><p>Development cards are color specific, which really only matters
for the 1 VP cards</p></li>
<li><p>Each player has one hand, and the robber limit is 14 instead of
7.  Possibly this should be more like ten or even seven.</p></li>
<li><p>The game still ends when one color gets to 10 VP, but the goal
is to not come in last.  Whichever player has the color with the
fewest VP at the end of the game loses.  The player who got to 10 VP
first wins ties.</p></li>
<li><p>Trading is allowed, I guess, though since the game is zero-sum
you wouldn't actually trade with each other.</p></li>
<li><p>Hands are <a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/open-hand-catan"">open</a>, not to
facilitate trading but to make the strategy more interesting by
letting you better model your opponent.</p></li>
</ul>



</p><p>

We played two games, but stopped the first one very early on.  We
agreed that one of us had an 80% chance of winning and so counted it
as 80% of a win.  Like a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backgammon#Doubling_cube"">doubling
cube</a> this helps concentrate your time onto interesting games.

</p>

<p>


I enjoyed playing, though I don't know how many more games of it I'd
like to play.  In generally I enjoy the dynamic of games with more
people a lot more, though under the current circumstances that's not
always practical.  It has less waiting than regular Catan, which is a
plus.

</p>

<p>

I think the 36-card variant (""gamblers fallacy dice"") would help here
a lot more than in regular Catan, since otherwise the game can get
unbalanced quickly due to quirks of the die.  In general I like the
way the card variant adds strategy, especially if it's easy for the
players to tell what cards are yet to come.

</p>

<p>

Because there's no trading, ports are a lot more important than in a
regular game.  David picked a port-heavy strategy while I went for
variety, and (n=1) ports works better.

</p>

<p>

After playing I looked around for other sets of two-player rules and
<a href=""https://catan.fandom.com/wiki/2-player_variant"">there are</a> <a href=""https://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/6104/how-do-you-make-settlers-of-catan-work-well-for-2-players-problems-and-play-te"">a
lot</a> <a href=""http://georgejaros.com/Files/Catan-for-2-Players.pdf"">of
variants</a> <a href=""http://nick.borko.org/games/Catan2Players.pdf"">out
there</a>!  I haven't looked through them in detail to figure
out whether I like this one best.

And it seems specifically important for the discussion of masks and respirators.<br><br>For example (not a doctor): every new leukemia drug has a survival rate of like 30%. Base rate survival is like 60%. Does every new leukemia drug work worse than normal? Obviously not, it&apos;s that the patients trying the new drug are the ones for whom everything else has failed, so they&apos;ve been signed up for a clinical trial. These patients have very resistant cancers. And we can verify this, because when the drug does get adopted then survival rates go up.<br><br>Doctors have mostly figured this out with this subset of leukemia drugs. They do adjustments for how resistant the crazy-resistant cancers in the trial are, the adjustments aren&apos;t good enough and show the drug has no effect or is bad, they throw the adjustments out and do something else (like compare the results of this new drug to some other new drug that&apos;s almost like a control group), and they eventually seem to come to decent conclusions about whether to use the new drug in a setting that&apos;s more conducive to sane trial results.<br><br>However, in a lot of cases, they don&apos;t seem to figure this out, and it results in truly terrible treatment policies. The clearest example I&apos;ve seen is in a few localized forms of cancer (like various sarcomas), where amputation shows vastly worse survival than local resection. As crazy as this seemed, it was minutely possible that side effects of amputation were in fact so bad that this was true, but after looking into it extensively I am very sure that in most extremity amputations it is not true. Doctors who see more aggressive tumors advocate amputation, these more aggressive tumors have worse overall survival regardless of how you treat, and amputation winds up looking statistically worse than local resection. And now the researchers who looked at this are advocating for fewer amputations, which will cost lives.<br><br>I&apos;ve seen this in other cases too. The most recent: in patients with COPD, taking inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17400730"">is associated with</a> higher pneumonia rates by a factor of 1.5 or something. This makes sense mechanistically, because corticosteroids do reduce immune function. But pneumonia rates are <a href=""https://www.lung.org/blog/pneumonia-and-lung-disease"">~8x higher</a> in people with COPD! One of the first hypotheses that should jump out here is that people with mild COPD take ICS less than those with severe COPD, and ICS helps those with severe COPD have pneumonia less but not enough to make up the full difference! I don&apos;t know, maybe I&apos;m the one missing something and people with severe COPD always use bronchodilators or something other than more ICS. But you at least have to address this in the study! And my hypothesis is supported by the fact that in asthma patients, ICS reduces pneumonia by a <a href=""https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/full/10.1164/rccm.201005-0694OC"">factor of ~2</a>.<br><br>So, the pattern is that disease A has treatment X. Those with worse disease A have worse outcomes by, say, a factor of 3. Treatment X improves outcomes by a factor of 2 and is given preferentially or in higher doses to those with worse disease A because of cost or side effects of unclear size. An observational study comes along and sees that treatment X is associated with 1.5x worse outcomes than not-X! Or maybe just that outcomes are about the same. They denounce X as showing &quot;no appreciable benefit&quot; or &quot;signs of harm&quot;. <br><br>You won&apos;t always see this pattern. With randomization, you won&apos;t see it. If the treatment doesn&apos;t change in dose or type with increasing disease burden, you won&apos;t see it. Or if the beneficial effect of the treatment significantly outpaces the harmful effects of increased disease. The pattern is worst in cases where an observational study looks at a disease with quickly-scaling outcomes and a treatment that is partial or underpowered (cf cancer and COVID).<br><br>There&apos;s some old joke about how taking supplement X is associated with low levels of X. It&apos;s the same thing, just slightly more insidious.<br><br>Anyways, I&apos;m concerned this pattern is showing up with the COVID discussions of masks and respirators. Both are things you&apos;d common-sensically assume were helpful. Both show some weird nebulous signs of making things worse. (Certainly ventilators cause very serious side effects, but recently I saw some more serious claims about not boosting survival at all and thus being obviously net-costly. But of course, common sense says they have to be boosting survival some!) But if this is the news you&apos;d expect to hear even in the world where there was no harm being done, the fact that you hear it is not much evidence that there&apos;s in fact harm being done.<br><br>I feel irresponsible for posting this without doing too much investigation of the masks and ventilators, because plausibly this is pointing in the wrong policy direction on them, but I don&apos;t have time for that at the moment. But in the meantime, I would like if every excited contrarian buzz about a treatment showing counterintuitive harm could be accompanied by SOME statement addressing the fact that you&apos;d expect to see those results regardless of harm.</p><p>ETA: <a href=""https://chemrxiv.org/articles/COVID-19_Disease_ORF8_and_Surface_Glycoprotein_Inhibit_Heme_Metabolism_by_Binding_to_Porphyrin/11938173"">Some evidence</a> SARS-CoV-2 attacks hemoglobin, which could inhibit gas exchange enough to cause oxygen poisoning in the lungs if oxygen concentrators or ventilators are used.

Better to get thoughts down for those who want to read them.</p>
<p><a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/04/14/a-failure-but-not-of-prediction/"">Scott Alexander’s latest post</a> points to the question of how best to evaluate predictions. The way he characterized leading predictions on Trump and Brexit, that ‘prediction is hard,’ instinctively bothered me. Characterizing the coronavirus situation the same way bothered me even more.</p>
<p>(Before anyone asks, I was ahead of the public but definitely dropped the ball on the early coronavirus prediction front, in the sense that I failed to make a lot of money and failed to warn the public, and waited far too long to move out of New York City. A large part of that fault was that I predicted things badly by my own standards. A large part was other failures. I take full responsibility. But that’s not what I want to talk about right now.)</p>
<p>How does one evaluate past predictions?</p>
<p>As someone who used to place wagers and/or price prediction markets for a living, and later traded with what I believe are some of the best traders on the planet, I’ve thought about this question a lot.</p>
<p>We can divide situation into <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/08/26/play-in-easy-mode/"">easy mode</a>, where there are a large number of independent predictions made and robust markets or probabilities against which one can evaluate those predictions, and <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/08/26/play-in-hard-mode/"">hard mode</a>, where this is not true, and you are often evaluating an individual prediction of a singular event.</p>
<p><span></span></p>
<h3>Easy Mode</h3>
<p>Most of my time was spent largely in the ‘<a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/08/26/play-in-easy-mode/"">easy mode.</a>‘ Here, easy mode is when one is predicting lots of things for which there are established market prices, or at a minimum baseline fair values that one can be evaluated against. You have a lot of data points, and are comparing your predictions and decisions to a known baseline.</p>
<p>Easy mode makes it realistic to seek a metric that cannot be easily fooled, where you can use your results as evidence to prove what you are doing ‘works’ in some sense.</p>
<p>There is no one metric that is best even in easy mode. There are a few different ones that have merit. I’ll go through at least some of them.</p>
<h3>Method One: Money Talks, Bull*** Walks</h3>
<p>Did you make money?</p>
<p>If you did, congratulations. Good predicting.</p>
<p>If you didn’t, sorry. Bad predicting. If you didn’t bet, it doesn’t count.</p>
<p>This method has a lot to recommend it. It’s especially great over long periods of time with lots of distinct opportunities of relatively constant size and odds, where gains or losses from individual trades are well bounded.</p>
<p>There are however some severe problems, and one should try to seek other method.</p>
<p>If your trades have tail risk, and can have huge positive or negative payoffs, then that risk can often dominate your expected value (your Alpha) but not impact your observed results, or impact your observed results out of proportion to (or even in the opposite direction of) the Alpha involved.</p>
<p>If you sometimes trade big and sometimes trade small, that reflects your confidence and should be weighed, but also can lead to your bigger trades being all that matters. Which trades are big is often a matter of opportunity and circumstance, or an attempt to manipulate results, rather than reflecting what we want to measure.</p>
<p>Often trades and predictions are highly correlated even if they don’t look correlated.</p>
<p>Trading results often reflect other trading skills, such as speed and negotiation and ability to spot obvious errors. It’s very possible to have a trading strategy that spends most of its time doing things at random, but occasionally someone else typos or makes a huge mental error or there’s a bug in someone’s code, or you find a really dumb counter-party who likes to play very big, and suddenly you make a ton.</p>
<p>The exact method of trading, and which instruments are used, often has a dramatic effect on results even though it expresses the same underlying predictions.</p>
<p>Adverse selection shows up in real world trades where and how you least expect it to. Also exactly how you most expect it to.</p>
<p>And so on. It gets ugly.</p>
<p>These and other things allow someone trying to demonstrate skill to manipulate their results and <em>usually </em>get away with it, or for someone with good luck to look much better than they are, often for a remarkably long time.</p>
<p>In general, see the book <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Fooled-Randomness-Hidden-Markets-Incerto/dp/0812975219"">Fooled by Randomness</a>, and assume it’s worse than that.</p>
<p>Still, it’s money, and it’s useful.</p>
<h3>Method Two: Trading Simulation, Where Virtual Money Talks</h3>
<p>In this method, we start with a set of predictions, or a model that makes those predictions from data. Then we establish rules for how it will trade based on that information, and see whether the system makes money.</p>
<p>The big risk is that we can cheat. Our system <em>would have </em>made lots of money. Uh huh. Lots of ways to cheat.</p>
<p>Thus, the best simulations are where the person making the predictions is distinct from the person running the simulation, and the simulation runs in real time.</p>
<p>My good friend Seth Burn will run these simulations on sports models. He’ll take Nate Silver’s or ESPN’s or someone else’s predictions, translate them into win probabilities if necessary, then see what would happen if they were allowed to wager at market odds using Kelly betting. Sometimes it goes well. Other times it goes poorly. I generally consider making such models go full <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion"">Kelly</a>, without adjusting beliefs at all for market odds, a bit harsh. You Never Go Full Kelly. But I do get it.</p>
<p>When I run simulations on my own stuff, or often other people’s stuff, I will instead use threshold betting. If something is good enough, one unit will be wagered, and sometimes this will be scaled up to two or three units gradually as perceived edge improves. But we won’t force the system to Go Full Kelly. Because that would lead to heavily distorted results. The way you know if your plan is profitable is if it can make money a little at a time, not whether it would get lucky or blow itself up if you didn’t take reasonable precautions. And again, You Never Go Full Kelly.</p>
<p>Simulated trading is vital if you are planning to do actual trading. If you don’t simulate the things you intend to actually do, you can find yourself effectively testing a dramatically different hypothesis than the hypothesis you expected to test. That can end very badly.</p>
<p>These types of tests are good sanity checks and gut checks, all around. They make it much harder to fool yourself, if implemented reasonably.</p>
<p>Of course, in other ways, they make it easier to fool yourself.</p>
<p>Overfitting on results of any kind is highly dangerous, and this can encourage that and make it much worse. Often simulations are doing much more highly correlated things than one realizes, on any number of levels. Unscrupulous people of course can easily manipulate such results, it can become the worst kind of p-hacking taken up a level.</p>
<p>A big risk that is that you can think that your predictions are good because you have a handful of data errors. If your predictions are remotely sane, then any large error in historical prices will be something your simulation jumps on. You’ll make a ton on those, whereas in real life any attempt to take advantage of those opportunities would not have been allowed, and also not all that impressive an act of prediction. Guarding against this is super important, and usually involves manually looking at any situations where you think your edge is super large to ensure your recorded market prices are real.</p>
<p>Most of all, this method doesn’t actually reward accurate predictions. It rewards predictions that tend to disagree in the correct direction. That’s a very different thing.</p>
<p>Thus, think of this as an indicative and necessary method of evaluation wherever it is available, but in no way as a sufficient method, even when implemented properly in real time. But certainly, if the real time simulated test keeps working, I will consider updating my priors away from the market prices, and putting real money on the line after a while.</p>
<h3>Method Three: The Green Knight Test</h3>
<p>The Green Knight test gets its name from a character in the Arthurian legend. You get to swing at The Green Knight, then The Green Knight gets to swing at you.</p>
<p>Thus, you get to trade against the market at its fair price. Then the market <em>gets to trade against you, </em>at the model’s fair price, for the same amount. So if it’s a prediction market and the market says 50% and you say 60%, your net price is 55%. Whereas if you say 90%, your average price will be 70%, and you’ll do a lot worse.</p>
<p>How much you are allowing yourself to consider market prices, when deciding on your own beliefs, is your decision. If the answer isn’t ‘quite a lot’ it can get very expensive.</p>
<p>The point of The Green Knight Test is to use markets and trades to put you to the test, but to treat your model and the market as equals. The question is not whether you can directionally spot market inefficiencies. That’s (relatively) easy. I firmly believe that one can spot some amount of inefficiency in any market.</p>
<p>The question is, <em>can you come up with better values than the market? </em>That’s very, very hard if your process doesn’t heavily weigh the existing market prices. If you can pass this test without looking directly at the market prices at all, and you’ve confirmed that the market prices in question were real, your prices really are better than the market’s prices.</p>
<p>The even harder version of the test is to fully reverse the scenario. You take <em>only </em>the role of the market maker, allowing the market to trade at your model’s fair prices. If you can survive without a substantial loss, now you can <em>fully </em>reject the market’s prices, and treat your model’s prices as real.</p>
<p>The advantage of The Green Knight Test is it reminds you exactly how much you do not know, and holds you to a very high standard. Unless you are doing a pure math exercise like pricing derivatives, it’s <em>expected </em>that you will fail this test. It’s <em>perfectly fine. </em>The goal is to fail it less, and to remember that you fail it. Except when you actually pass it, then the sky’s the limit.</p>
<p>And yes, on one occasion that didn’t involve a derivative, I did pass this test convincingly. That’s a story for another day.</p>
<h3>Method Four: Log Likelihood</h3>
<p>I have no idea why I needed actual Eliezer Yudkowsky to first point out to me I should be using this, but once he did point this out it became obvious. Log likelihood for probabilistic outcomes are the obvious go-to standard thing to try.</p>
<p>If your goal is to reward accuracy and punish inaccuracy, log likelihood will do that in expectation. Your score on any given event is the natural log of your model’s probability of the outcome that happened.</p>
<p>Every time you improve your probability estimates, your expected score improves. Make your model worse, and it gets worse. Be highly overconfident and it will cost you quite a lot.</p>
<p>The best feature of log likelihood is that it provides perfect incentives.</p>
<p>The problem is that when you look at a score, you have no idea what you are looking at. There is no intuitive association between an LL score and a level of accuracy in prediction. Part of that is that we’re not used to them. The bigger issue is that a score doesn’t mean anything outside of the <em>exact </em>context and sample the score is based upon.</p>
<p>LL only scores mean something when you compare model one to model two <em>on the exact same set of predictions. </em></p>
<p>They are all but useless with even tiny variations in what predictions are being scored. One additional unlikely event happening, or even one event being a foregone conclusion rather than a coin flip, will wipe out massive gains from model improvements, sometimes across thousands of predicted events.</p>
<p>What <em>is </em>meaningful is, we have this set of predictions, and we compare it to the market’s implicit predictions, and/or to another model or version of the model, and see which is better. Now we can get an idea of the magnitude of improvement (although again, what that magnitude means won’t be intuitive, other than to compare different score gaps with each other).</p>
<p>All of that skepticism assumes that everyone’s model is doing something sane. If someone is making huge mistakes, LL scores will pick it up very loudly as long as there is time to get punished for those mistakes enough times. If you’re going around saying 99% on 75% shots, or 20% on 50% shots, that will cut through a lot of noise.</p>
<p>Of course, if you were making errors that severe, there hopefully isn’t much need to use LL in order to realize that.</p>
<h3>Method Five: Calibration Testing</h3>
<p>This is the way Scott Alexander scores <a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/04/08/2019-predictions-calibration-results/"">his predictions</a>.</p>
<p>The principle is that your 60% predictions should happen 60% of the time, your 70% predictions should happen 70%, and so on. If they happen more often than that, you’re under-confident. If they happen less than that, you’re over-confident.</p>
<p>This is certainly a useful thing to check. If you’re consistently coming in with bad calibration, or are reliably badly calibrated at a particular point (e.g. perhaps your 10% chances are really 5%, but your 30%+ chances are roughly fair) then you can correct that particular mistake.</p>
<p>At a minimum, this is a bar that any predictor needs to clear if it wants to keep making probabilistic predictions with a straight face.</p>
<p>If you won’t put probabilities on your predictions, this test won’t work, except that we’ve already shown you aren’t doing very good predicting.</p>
<p>In most cases this will quickly reveal that someone <em>isn’t trying </em>to choose realistic probabilities. <a href=""http://benjaminrosshoffman.com/actors-and-scribes-words-and-deeds/"">They’re saying words that they think will have a particular impact</a>.</p>
<p>Such people can still be making useful predictions. To choose a very blatant example of someone doing this constantly, when Scott Adams says something is 100% going to happen, he neither believes this nor considers himself to be lying. To him, that’s just ‘good persuasion’ to anchor people high and force them to update. What he means is, ‘I think event X is more likely than you would think, so increase your probability estimate of X.’</p>
<p>There might or might not be a ‘substantially more than 50%’ actual prediction in there. If you read more than that into his statement, he’d say that’s your fault for being bad at persuasion.</p>
<p>Certainly he does not think that the numerous times a 100% to happen thing did not happen should send him to Bayes’ hell or cause people to dismiss his statements as worthless. He also doesn’t think one should ignore such misses, but why would you take someone’s stated numbers seriously?</p>
<p>Thus, asking if someone is well-calibrated is a way of asking if they are for reals attempting to provide accurate information, and if they have developed some of the basic skills required to do so. Learning whether this is so is very good and useful.</p>
<p>The problem with calibration testing is that you can get a perfect score on calibration without providing any useful predictions.</p>
<p>The direct cheat is one option. It’s very easy to pick things in the world that are 90% to happen, or 75%, or 50%, or 1%, if you are making up the statements yourself.</p>
<p>The more subtle cheat is another. You can have your 75% predictions be half things that are definitely true, and half things that are true half the time. Maybe you’re making a real error when you conflate them. Maybe you’re doing it on purpose. Hard to say.</p>
<p>This is typically what happens when people who are ‘well-calibrated’ give 90% (or 95% or 98% or 99.9%) probabilities. They’re mostly building in a chance they are making a stupid mistake or misunderstood the question, or other similar possibilities. Which you have to do.</p>
<p>Calibration is a good sanity check. It’s no substitute for actual evaluation.</p>
<h3>Method Six: <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2020/04/10/the-one-mistake-rule/"">The One Mistake Rule</a></h3>
<p>This method is where you look for an <em>obviously wrong </em>probability. Obviously wrong can be on the level of ‘a human who understands the space would know this instantly’ or it can be on the level of ‘upon reflection that number can’t possibly be right, or it contradicts your other answers that you’re still sticking with.’ The level required to spot a mistake, and how big a mistake you can spot, are ways of measuring how good the predictions are.</p>
<p>Often when you find an obviously wrong statement, you find something important about whoever made the statement. In many cases, you learn that person is a bullshit artist. In other cases, you learn that there’s something important they don’t or didn’t know or understand, or something they overlooked. Or you find something important about their world view that caused this strange answer.</p>
<p>And of course sometimes they’re right and you’re wrong. Also a great time to learn something.</p>
<p>Same thing for a model. If you find a model saying something clearly wrong, then you can use that to find a flaw in the model. Ideally you can then fix the flaw. Failing that, you hope to know what the flaw is so you can correct for it if it happens again – you can flag the model explicitly as not taking factor X into account.</p>
<p>Other times they made a sign or data entry error. There’s always bugs in the code. It’s not always a revelation.</p>
<p>That leads into the concept of evaluating an individual prediction. Which is what one must do in hard mode.</p>
<h3>Hard Mode</h3>
<p>In <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/08/26/play-in-hard-mode/"">hard mode</a>, our metrics don’t work. We need to use reason to think carefully about particular spots.</p>
<p>Looking back, we ask the question of whether our predictions and probabilities were good, what reasonable predictions and probabilities would have been and why, and what information we should have looked for or would have changed our opinions. There are a few different ways to evaluate.</p>
<p>One question to ask is, suppose we were to rewind time. How often would things again turn out the way they did, versus another way? How close was this event’s outcome? Could random events from there have changed the outcome often? What about initial conditions you had no way of knowing about? What about conditions you didn’t know about but could have checked, or should have checked, and what were those conditions? What would have had to have gone differently?</p>
<p>In some cases, one looks back and the result looks inevitable. In others, it was anything but inevitable, and if it had rained in different cities, or one person makes a different hard decision, or news stories happen to slant a different way or something, on the crucial day the other candidate gets elected. In others, it was inevitable if you were omniscient, but given your information it was anyone’s game.</p>
<p>Sports are a great tool for this question because remarkably few things in sports are truly inevitable. Sports are full of guessing games and physical randomness. Any Given Sunday really does mean something, and one can look back and say a game was 50% versus 65% vs. 80% vs. 95% vs. 99% vs. 99.9% vs. 99.99% for the favorite to win. The question of ‘what was the real probability’ is truly meaningful. Someone who said the wrong number by a sufficient margin can be <em>objectively</em> <em>wrong, </em>regardless of whether that favorite actually won.</p>
<p>That’s not true for many other things, but it is a useful perspective to treat it as if it was it <em>more true </em>from <em>more perspectives </em>in <em>more ways </em>than people think.</p>
<p>Obviously this is not an exact science.</p>
<p>For sports, I could go into endless examples and the merits of various methods of evaluation. One good standard there is ‘what would be the odds if they played another game next week?’ Which has some weird stuff in it but is mostly a concrete way of thinking about ‘what would happen if we re-ran the event and randomized the details of the initial conditions?’</p>
<p>Another good general approach is ‘what do I now know that I didn’t know before, and how does that change my prediction?’ Where did my model of events go wrong?</p>
<p>A third thing to do is to look at the components of your predictions. In hindsight, do the implied conditional probabilities make sense? When things started to happen, how did you update your model? If they had gone differently, how would you have updated, and would those updates have added up to an expected value close to zero?</p>
<p>A fourth thing to do is look at the <em>hidden assumptions. </em>What are your predictions assuming about the world that you didn’t realize you were assuming, or that turned out not to be true? Often you can learn a lot here.</p>
<p>A key takeaway from doing my analysis below of various predictions is that <em>my opinion of the prediction often depends almost not at all on the outcome. </em>Your prediction’s logic is still its logic. In many cases, the actual outcome is only one additional data point.</p>
<p>One cannot point out too many times how easy it is to fool yourself with such questions, if you are looking to be fooled, or even not looking to not be fooled.</p>
<p>Since most of my audience is not deep into the sportsball, I will illustrate further only with non-sports examples.</p>
<p>It makes sense to start with the two that inspired this post, then go from there.</p>
<p>Note that I’ll be doing political analysis, but keeping this purely to probabilities of events. No judgments here, no judgments in the comments, please.</p>
<h3>Scott’s two examples</h3>
<p>Scott’s two examples from his recent post were Brexit and the 2016 Presidential Election.</p>
<p>In both cases, predictors that are at least trying to try, such as Nate Silver and Tetlock’s forecasters, put the chances of things going the historical way at roughly 25% right before the elections happened. Also in both cases, mainstream pundits and conventional wisdom mostly claimed at the time that the chance was far lower, in many cases very close to (but not quite) 0%. In both cases, there were people who predicted the other outcome and thought it was likely to happen, but not many. Also in both cases, the result may have partially been caused by the expectation of the other result. If voters had realized the elections were close, voters might have decided differently.</p>
<p>Importantly, in both cases, the polls, which are the best first-level way to predict any election, had the wrong side ahead but by amounts that historically and statistically were insufficient to secure victory.</p>
<p>Both elections were very close. Remain had almost as many votes as leave, to the extent that different weather in different areas of the United Kingdom could have made the difference (London voted heavily remain, other places for leave). Trump lost the popular vote and barely won the electoral college, after many things broke his way in the final week and day.</p>
<p>These are textbook cases, in this system, of results that were very much not inevitable. It is <em>very, very easy </em>to tell stories of slightly different sequences of events in the final week or days that end in the opposite result. If everything visible had been the same but the outcome went the other way, it would not have been more surprising than what happened even in hindsight.</p>
<p>As we were warned would happen, both results were then treated as far more inevitable than they actually were. Media and people in general rushed to form a narrative that these results were always going to happen. The United Kingdom treated a tiny majority as an inviolate will of the people rather than what it was, evidence that the country was about evenly split. Everyone wrote about the United States completely differently than if a hundred thousand votes had been distributed differently, or any number of decisions had been made a different way.</p>
<p>If you bet on Trump or on Leave at the available market prices, you made a great trade.</p>
<p>But, if you claimed that those sides were definitely going to win, that it was inevitable (e.g. the Scott Adams position) then <em>you were more wrong than those who said the same thing about Leave and Clinton. </em>This seems clear to me despite your side actually winning.</p>
<p>The only way to believe that predicting a Trump win as inevitable was a reasonable prediction is to assume facts about the world not in evidence. To me, it is a claim that the election either was stolen, or <em>would have been stolen </em>if Trump had been about to lose it. Same or similar thing with Leave.</p>
<p>The generalized version of that, as opposed to election fraud, is a more common pattern than is commonly appreciated. The way that things that <em>look </em>close are actually inevitable is that the winning side had lots of things up their sleeve, or had effectively blocked the scenarios where they might lose, in ways that are hard to observe. Try to change the outcome and the world pushes back hard. They didn’t pull out their ace in the hole because they didn’t need it, but it was there.</p>
<p>I don’t merely think that Nate Silver’s ~25% chance for Trump (and 10% chance to win despite losing the popular vote!) was merely what Scott Alexander called it, a bad prediction but ‘the best we could do.’ I think it was actually a pretty great prediction, the reasonable hindsight range is something like 20% to 40%. You need to give a decent chunk of the distribution to Trump, and he can’t be the favorite. If your prediction was way off of this <em>in either direction </em>I think you were wrong. I think Remain vs. Leave follows a very similar pattern.</p>
<p>(For the 2020 Election, I similarly think that anyone who thinks either candidate is a huge favorite is wrong, and will almost certainly in hindsight still have been wrong in this way regardless of the eventual outcome, because so many things could happen on multiple fronts. To be confident you’d need to be confident <em>at a minimum </em>of the politics <em>and</em> the economics <em>and</em> the epidemiology. That doesn’t mean it will be close on election day, or in October.)</p>
<h3>Scott’s calibration exercise</h3>
<p>Scott’s predictions are a clean set of probabilities that are clearly fair game. Sticking there seems reasonable.</p>
<p>Let’s look at Scott’s predictions for the year 2019 next. How do they look?</p>
<p>By his convention, strikethroughs mean it didn’t happen, lack of a strikethrough means it happened.</p>
<h3>Politics (Reminder, strategic discussions only, please)</h3>
<ol>
<li>Donald Trump remains president: 90%</li>
<li>Donald Trump is impeached by the House: 40%</li>
</ol>
<p>The house impeached Trump for something that, as of the time of the prediction, hadn’t  happened yet. It is clear the actual barrier to convincing Pelosi was high. If things had been enough worse, impeachment might have not have happened because resignation. So you could reasonably say the 40% number looks somewhat high in hindsight. The argument for it not being high is if you think Trump always keeps escalating until impeachment happens, especially if you think Trump actively wanted to be impeached. I’m inclined to say that on its own 40% seems reasonable, as would have 20% or 30%.</p>
<p>The 90% number is all-cause remaining President. Several percent of the time Trump dies of natural causes, as he’s in his 70s. Several percent more has to be various medical conditions that prevent him from serving. Again, he’s in his 70s. World leaders also sometimes get shot, we’ve lost multiple presidents that way. Also, he’s impulsive and weird and looks like he often hates being president so maybe he decides to declare America great again and quit. And if there’s a dramatic change to world conditions and   the USA doesn’t have a president anymore, he’s not president. Small probabilities but  they add up. The majority of the 10% has to be baked in. We can reduce some of those a little in hindsight but not much.</p>
<p>So saying 90% is actually giving a very small probability of Trump leaving office for other reasons, especially given a 40% chance of impeachment – his probability of surviving politically conditional on the house being willing to impeach has to be at least 90%. Given the ways Trump did react and might have reacted to such conditions, and that some of the time the underlying accusations are much worse than what we got, this looks overconfident at 90% and I’d prefer to see 80%. But a lot of that is the lack of precision available when you only predict by 10% increments; 85% would have been fine.</p>
<p><s>3. Kamala Harris leads the Democratic field: 20%</s><br />
<s>4. Bernie Sanders leads the Democratic field: 20%</s><br />
5. Joe Biden leads the Democratic field: 20%<br />
<s>6. Beto O’Rourke leads the Democratic field: 20%</s></p>
<p>(Disclosure, at PredictIt I sold at various points all but three candidates, one of those three was Joe Biden, and my mistake in hindsight was not waiting longer to sell a few of them along with not selling one of the other two when I had the chance).</p>
<p>Scott’s nominee predictions, however, seem <em>really </em>sloppy. These four candidates were not equally likely. The prediction markets didn’t think so, their backgrounds and the polls didn’t think so. The dynamics we saw play out don’t think so, either. Things came down to a former vice president to a popular president who led in the polls most of the way versus the previous cycle’s runner up.</p>
<p>Putting them on equal footing with a random congressman from Texas who lost a close race once while looking exciting, or a more traditionally plausible alternative candidate like Kamala Harris, doesn’t age well.</p>
<p>Nor does having these all be 20% and adding to 80%, leaving 20% left for the other 16 or so candidates including Elizabeth Warren, plus any unexpected late entries.</p>
<p>The defense of the 20% on Biden is to say Biden was known to be old and a terrible candidate who predictably ran a terrible primary campaign, so he was overrated even though he ended up winning, while Harris and O’Rourke were plausibly very good candidates given what we knew at the time. I do think there’s broad range for such arguments, but not to this extent.</p>
<p>This is where calibration makes you look good but shouldn’t. Name the four leading candidates (or at least four plausible-to-be-top-four candidates, to be generous) and give them each 20% and your calibration will look <em>mostly</em> fine even if that evaluation doesn’t make sense and the remaining field is really more like 30-40% than 20%.</p>
<p>This is also where the human element can warp your findings. There’s a lot of ‘X has to be higher than Y’, or ‘X ~= Y here looks sloppy’ or ‘X can’t be an underdog given Z’ or what not. We have a  lot of rules of thumb, and those who break those rules will look worse than they deserve, while those that follow those rules but otherwise talk nonsense will look better.</p>
<p>As usual, use a variety of evaluation methods and switch them up when it looks like someone might be Goodharting.</p>
<p>7. Trump is still leading in prediction markets to be Republican nominee: 70%<br />
8. Polls show more people support the leading Democrat than the leading Republican: 80%</p>
<p>This 70% number seems like a miss low to me <em>if you accept Scott’s other predictions above.</em> In Scott’s model, Trump is 90% to be President, which means he’s now twice as likely to be President but losing the nomination fight, despite at the time facing zero credible opposition. If you again take out the 5%+ chance that Trump is physically unfit for office and leaves because of it, that makes it many times more likely to Scott that Trump can’t get the nomination but stays President, versus him stepping down. I can’t come up with a good defense of less than 80% or so in this context.</p>
<p>Predicting the Democratic candidate as likely to be ahead seems right, as that had been largely both true and stable for a while for pretty much any plausible Democratic candidate. 80% seems a little overconfident if we’re interpreting this as likely voters, but not crazy. A year is a long time, the baseline scenario was for a pretty good economy, and without anything especially good for Trump happening we saw some close polls.</p>
<p>Of course, if we interpret this as <em>all Americans </em>then 80% seems too low, since non-voters and especially children overwhelmingly support Democrats. And if we literally read this as <em>people anywhere </em>then it should be 95% or more. A reminder of how important it is to word predictions carefully.</p>
<p>9. Trump’s approval rating below 50: 90%<br />
<s>10. Trump’s approval rating below 40: 50%</s></p>
<p>90% seems overconfident to me, although 80% would have been too low. It’s saying that the world is definitely in ‘nothing matters’ mode and meaningful things are unlikely to happen. This of course goes along with the 80% chance he’ll be behind in the polls, since if he’s above 50% approval he’s going to be ahead in the polls almost every time.</p>
<p>50% for approval ratings below 40 seems clearly <em>more right </em>than 40% or 60% would have been. This is an example of predictions needing to be evaluated at the appropriate level of precision. It’s easy to say “roughly 50%” here, so the ‘smart money’ is the ones who can say 53% instead of 50% and have it be accurate. So credit here for staying sane, which is something.</p>
<p><s>11. Current government shutdown ends before Feb 1: 40%</s><br />
12. Current government shutdown ends before Mar 1: 80%<br />
13. Current government shutdown ends before Apr 1: 95%<br />
<s>14. Trump gets at least half the wall funding he wants from current shutdown: 20%</s><br />
15. Ginsberg still alive: 50%</p>
<p>I would not have been 95% confident that the shutdown wouldn’t extend past April 1. It doesn’t seem implausible to me at all that the two sides could have deadlocked for much longer, since it’s a zero-sum game with <em>at least </em>one of the players as a pure zero-sum thinker and where the players hate each other. There were very plausible paths where there were no reasonable lines of retreat. Once we get into March, chances of things resolving seem like they do down, not up. I think the 40% and 80% predictions look slightly high, but reasonable.</p>
<p>I am not enough of a medical expert to speak to Ginsberg’s chances of survival, but I’m guessing 50% was too low.</p>
<p>ECON AND TECH<br />

<s>21. SpaceX successfully launches and returns crewed spacecraft: 90%</s><br />
<s>22. SpaceX Starship reaches orbit: 10%</s><br />
23. No city where a member of the general public can ride self-driving car without attendant: 90%<br />
<s>24. I can buy an Impossible Burger at a grocery store within a 30 minute walk from my house: 70%</s><br />
25. Pregabalin successfully goes generic and costs less than $100/month on GoodRx.com: 50%<br />
26. No further CRISPR-edited babies born: 80%</p>
<p>The first question I always wonder when I see predictions about Bitcoin is whether the prediction implies a buy or implies a sale.</p>
<p>At the time of these predictions, Bitcoin was trading at roughly $3,500.</p>
<p>Scott thought Bitcoin was a <strong>SCREAMING BUY.</strong></p>
<p>The reason this represents a screaming buy is that Scott has Bitcoin to be almost 50% to be trading higher versus lower. But if Bitcoin is higher, often it is double its current price or higher, which in fact happened. You have a long tail in one direction only. Even in Scott’s numbers, the 20% vs. 10% asymmetry at 1000 and 5000 points towards this.</p>
<p>Was that right, given what he knew? I… think so? Probably? I was already sufficiently synthetically long that I didn’t buy (if you’re founding a company that builds on blockchain, investing more in blockchains is much less necessary), but I did think that the mean value of Bitcoin a year later was probably substantially higher than its $3,500 price.</p>
<p>What is <em>clearly </em>wrong is expecting <em>so little variance </em>in the price of Bitcoin. We have Bitcoin more likely to be in the 3000-5000 range, or the 2000-3000 range, than to be above 5000 or below 1000. That doesn’t seem remotely reasonable to me, and I thought so at the time. That’s the thing about Bitcoin. It’s a wild ride. To think you shouldn’t be on the ride at all, given the upside available, you have to think the ride likely ends in a crash.</p>
<p>Bitcoin above Ethereum at 95% depends on how seriously you treat the correlation. At the time Ethereum was roughly $120 per coin, or about 3% of a Bitcoin. Most of Etherium’s variance for years has been Bitcoin’s variance, and they’ve been highly correlated.</p>
<p>Note that this isn’t ETH <em>market cap </em>above BTC market cap, it’s ETH above BTC, which requires an extra doubling.</p>
<p>If we think about three scenarios – BTC up a lot, BTC down a lot, BTC mostly unchanged – we see that ETH going up 3000% more than BTC seems like a very crazy outcome in at least two of those scenarios. Given how little variance we’ve put into BTC, giving ETH that much variance in the upside or mostly unchanged scenarios doesn’t make sense.</p>
<p>So the 5% probability is mostly coming from a BTC collapse that ETH survives. BTC being below 1000 is only 10% in this model. Of that 10%, <em>most </em>of the time this is a general blockhain collapse, and ETH does as badly or worse. So again, aside from general model uncertainty and ‘5% of the time strange things happen’ 5% seems super high for the full flippening to have happened, and felt so at the time.</p>
<p>And of course, again, if ETH is 5% to be above BTC and costs 3% of BTC, then ETH is super cheap relative to BTC! It’s worth more just based on this scenario sometimes happening! Anyone who holds BTC is a complete fool given this other opportunity, unless they are really into balancing a portfolio.</p>
<p>It’s important to note when predictions are making super bold claims, especially when the claims do not look that bold.</p>
<p>The Dow being 80% to be above its current value, by contrast, is a very safe and reasonable estimate, since crashes down tend to be large and we expect the market on average to have positive returns. Given rounding, can’t argue with that, and wouldn’t regardless of the outcome unless there was a known factor about to crash it (e.g. something analogous to covid-19 that was knowable at the time).</p>
<p>On to SpaceX. Being 90% confident of <em>anything </em>being accomplished in space travel for the first time by a new institution within a given year seems like a mistake given what I know about space travel. But I have not been following developments, so perhaps this was reasonable (e.g. they had multiple opportunities and well-planned-out missions to do this, and it took a lot to make it not happen). Others can fill this in better than I can. I have no idea how to evaluate their chances of reaching orbit, since that depends on the plausibility of the schedule in question, and how much they would care about the milestone for various reasons.</p>
<p>The self-driving car prediction depends on exactly what would have counted. If this would have to have been on the level of ‘hail a driverless cab to and from a large portions of a real city’ than 10% seems very reasonable. If it would have been sufficient to have some (much lesser) way in which a member of public could ride a driverless car, I think that wasn’t that far away from happening and this would have been too low.</p>
<p>I am very surprised that Scott couldn’t at the time buy an Impossible Burger within a 30 minute walk from his house. I know where his house is. I can buy one now, within a 30 minute walk from my house (modulo my complete unwillingness to set food in a grocery store, and also my unwillingness to buy an Impossible Burger), and in fact have even passed “meat” sections that were sold out except for Impossible Burgers. Major fast food chains sell them. Of course, they had a <em>very </em>good year, almost certainly much better than expected. So 70% seems fine here, to me, with the 30% largely being that Impossible Burgers don’t do as well as they did, and only a small portion of it being that Scott’s area mysteriously doesn’t carry them. Seriously, this is weird.</p>
<p>The prediction on Pregabalin I have no way to evaluate.</p>
<p>The question of CRISP-er edited babies should have been worded ‘are known to have been born’ or something similar, to make this something we can evaluate. Beyond that, it’s a hard one to think about.</p>
<p>WORLD<br />
<s>27. Britain out of EU: 60%</s><br />
<s>28. Britain holds second Brexit referendum: 20%</s><br />
29. No other EU country announces plan to leave: 80%<br />
30. China does not manage to avert economic crisis (subjective): 50%<br />
31. Xi still in power: 95%<br />
32. MbS still in power: 95%<br />
<s>33. May still in power: 70%</s><br />
34. Nothing more embarassing than Vigano memo happens to Pope Francis: 80%</p>
<p>Once again I the 95% numbers seem too high even when I can’t think of an exact scenario where they lose power, but again it’s not a major mistake.</p>
<p>The Vigano memo seems unusually embarrassing as a thing that happens to the Pope relative to the average year, thinking historically. Most years nothing terribly embarrassing happens to Popes, the continuing abuse scandal seems like the only plausible source for embarrassing things, and Francis seems if anything less likely than par to generate embarrassing things. So if anything 80% seems low, unless I’m forgetting other events.</p>
<p>The China prediction is subjective, and I don’t think I would have ruled it the same way Scott did, so it’s really tough to judge. But in general 50% chance of economic crisis within one year is a very bold prediction, so I’d want to know what made that year so different and whether it proved important.</p>
<p>Now it’s time to talk about the EU, and what happens after you vote for Brexit. It’s definitely been a chaotic series of events. It definitely could have gone differently at various points. Sometimes I wonder what would have happened if Boris Johnson had liked his Remain speech rather than his Leave speech.</p>
<p>I like 60% as a reasonable number for Britain out of EU in 2019. There were a lot of forces pushing Britain to leave given the vote. There were also practical reasons why it was not going to be easy, and overwhelming support for remaining in the EU in parliament if members got to vote their own opinions. Lots of votes throughout the year seemed in doubt several times over, with May and others making questionable tactical decisions that backfired and missing opportunities all the time. The EU itself could have reacted in several different ways. Even now we can see a lot of ways this could have gone.</p>
<p>How about 20% for a second referendum? We can consider two classes of referendum, related but to me they seem importantly distinct.</p>
<p>There’s the class where Her Majesty’s Government decides to do what the EU often does, which is have the voters keep voting until they get the right result. Given the vote was very close, and  that leaving turned out to not look like voters were promised, the only thing preventing this from working was some sort of mystical ‘the tribe has spoken’ vibe that took over the country.</p>
<p>Then there’s the class where the EU won’t play ball, or the UK politicians want to vomit when they see the kind of ball the EU was always prepared to play. They’re looking at a full Hard Brexit, and want to put the decision of whether or not to accept that onto the people.</p>
<p>Thus it’s not obvious in hindsight whether the referendum was more likely in the “Britain leaves” world or the “Britain stays” world, given that was already up in the air. Certainly it feels like something unlikely would have had to happen, so we’re well under 50%, but that it wasn’t <em>that </em>far from happening, so it was probably more than 10%. 20% seems fine.</p>
<p>May being 70% to stay in power, however, feels too high. May was clearly facing an impossible problem, while being committed to a horrible path, in a world where prime ministers are expected to resign if they don’t get their way. How often would Britain still be in the UK at the end of the year while May survived? That seems pretty unlikely to me, especially in hindsight, whereas Britain leaving without May seems at least as likely. So May at 70% and leaving at 60% doesn’t seem right.</p>
<p>SURVEY<br />
35. …finds birth order effect is significantly affected by age gap: 40%<br />
36. …finds fluoxetine has significantly less discontinuation issues than average: 60%<br />
37. …finds STEM jobs do not have significantly more perceived gender bias than non-STEM: 60%</p>
<p>(#38 got thrown out as confusing and I don’t know how to evaluate it anyway)</p>
<p>I would have been more confident on the merits in 35 and 37. Birth order effects have to come from somewhere, and the ‘affected’ side gets both directions. And the STEM prediction lets you have both about as much perceived bias and less bias, and I had no particular reason to believe it would come out bigger or smaller.</p>
<p>What’s more interesting, although obviously from a small sample size, is that all three proved true. So Scott’s hunches worked out. Should we suspect Scott was underconfident here?</p>
<p>This could be a case of <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2018/08/28/unknown-knowns/"">Unknown Knowns</a>. Scott has good reason to believe in these results, the survey has enough power to find results if they’re there, but Scott’s brain refuses to be that confident in a scientific hypothesis without seeing the data from a well-run randomized controlled trial.</p>
<p>I kid, but also there’s almost certainly a modesty issue happening here. I would predict that Scott would be reliably under-confident in his hunches that he thought enough of to include in his survey.</p>
<p>I started to go over Scott’s personal predictions, but found it mostly not to be a useful exercise. I don’t have the context.</p>
<p>There is of course one obvious thing to note.</p>
<p>PERSONAL – PROJECTS<br />
<s>63. I finish at least 10% more of [redacted]: 20%</s><br />

77. I have not started (= formally see first patient) my own practice: 80%<br />
78. I lease another version of the same car I have now: 90%</p>
<p>None of the personal projects happened. Almost all the professional predictions happened, most of which predict the continued status quo. That all seems highly linked, more like two big predictions than lots of different predictions. One would want to ask what the actual relevant predictions were.</p>
<p>Overall, clearly this person is trying. And there’s clearly a tension between getting 95% of 95% predictions right, and having most of them actually be 95% likely. Occasionally you screw up big and your 95% is actually 50%, and that can often be the bulk of the times such things fail. Or some of them are 85%, but again that can easily be the bulk of the failures. So it’s not entirely fair to complain about a 95% that should be 99% unless standards are super high.</p>
<p>Mostly, I’d like to encourage looking back more in this type of way when possible, in addition to any use of numeric metrics.</p>
<p>I also should look at my own predictions, but also want to make that a distinct post, because its subject matter will have a different appeal on its own merits.</p>
<p>I hope this was helpful, fun, interesting or some combination of all three. I don’t intend it to be perfectly thought out. Rather, I thought it was a useful thing for those interested, so I’d write it quickly, but not let it take too much time/effort away from other higher priority things.</p>

</style></head><body><p><strong>TLDR</strong>: I propose a system of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_ethics"">population ethics</a> that arguably solves all major paradoxes, and formalizes some intuitions that prior systems have not. AFAIK this is original but I'm not an expert so maybe it's not.</p>
<p><em>This idea was inspired by a discussion in the ""EA Corner"" discord server, and specifically by a different proposal by discord user LeoTal.</em></p>
<h1>Foreward: The Role of Utilitarnism</h1>
<p>I don't believe <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism"">utilitarianism</a> is literally the correct system of ethics (I <em>do</em> endorse <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequentialism"">consequentialism</a>). Human values are <a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Complexity_of_value"">complex</a> and no simple mathematical formula can capture them. Moreover, ethics is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethical_subjectivism"">subjective</a> and might different between cultures and between individuals.</p>
<p>However, I think it is useful to find simple approximate models of ethics, for two reasons.</p>
<p>First, my perspective is that ethics is just another name for someone's preferences, or a certain subset of someone's preferences. The source of preferences is ultimately intuition. However, intuition only applies to the familiar. You know that you prefer strawberries to lemons, just because. This preference is obvious enough to require no analysis. But, when you encounter the unfamiliar, intuition can fail. Is it better to cure a village of malaria or build a new school where there is none? Is it better to save one human or 1000 dogs? Can a computer simulation be worthy of moral consideration? What if it's <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption"">homomorphically encrypted</a>? Who knows?</p>
<p>In order to extrapolate your intuition from the familiar to the unfamiliar, you need <em>models</em>. You need to find an explicit, verbal representation that matches your intuition in the familiar cases, and that can be unambiguously applied to the unfamiliar case. And here you're justified to apply some Occam razor, despite the complexity of values, as long as you don't shave away too much.</p>
<p>Second, in order to cooperate and coordinate effectively we need to make our preferences explicit to each other and find a common ground we can agree on. I can make private choices based on intuition alone, but if I want to convince someone or we want to decide together <a href=""https://www.effectivealtruism.org/"">which charity to support</a>, we need something that can be communicated, analyzed and debated.</p>
<p>This is why I think questions like population ethics are important: not as a quest to find the One True Formula of morality, but as a tool for decision making in situations that are unintuitive and/or require cooperation.</p>
<h1>Motivation</h1>
<p>The system I propose, deminatalist total utilitarianism (DNT) has the following attractive properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>It avoids the <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/repugnant-conclusion/"">repugnant conclusion</a> to which regular total utilitarianism falls prey, at least the way it is usually pictured.</li>
<li>It avoids the many problems of average utilitarianism: the incentive to kill people of below-average happiness, the incentive to create people of negative happiness (that want to die) when the average happiness is negative, the sadistic conclusion and the non-locality (good and evil here depends on moral patients in the Andromeda galaxy).</li>
<li>It avoids the problem with both totalism and averagism that killing a person and creating a different person with equal happiness is morally neutral.</li>
<li>It captures the intuition many people have that the bar for when it's good to create a person is higher than the bar for when it's good not to kill one.</li>
<li>It captures the intuition some people have that they don't want to die but they would rather not have been born.</li>
<li>It captures the intuition some people have that <em>sometimes</em> living too long is bad (my dear transhumanist comrades, please wait before going for rotten tomatoes).</li>
</ul>
<h1>Formalism</h1>
<p>I am going to ignore issues of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_preference"">time discounting</a> and spatial horizons. In an infinite universe, you need some or your utilitarian formulas make no sense. However, this is, to first approximation, orthogonal to population ethics (i.e. the proper way to aggregate between individuals). If you wish, you can imagine everything constrained to your future light-cone with exponential time discount.</p>

<p>We can imagine the person in the intermediate case becoming ""tired of life"". Eir life is not good. It is not so bad as to warrant an earlier suicide, but there is only so much of it ey can take. One could argue that this should already be factored into ""happiness"", but well, it's not like I actually defined what happiness is. More seriously, perhaps rather than happiness it is better to think of <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""h""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">h</span></span></span></span></span></span> as the ""quality of life"".

<p>DNT is a form of total utilitarianism, so we also get a form of the repugnant conclusion. For vanilla utilitarianism the repugnant conclusion is: <strong>for any given population, there is a better population in which every individual only barely prefers life over death</strong>. On the other hand, for DNT, the ""repugnant"" conclusion take the form: <strong>for any given population, there is a better population in which every individual is only barely glad to have been born</strong> (but prefers life over death by a lot). This seems to me much more palatable.</p>

<h2>From Happiness to Preferences</h2>
<p>I believe that preference utilitarianism is often a better model than hedonistic utilitarianism, when it comes to adults and ""adult-like"" moral patients (i.e. moral patients that can understand and explain eir own preferences). What about DNT? We can take the perspective it corresponds to ""vanilla"" total preference utilitarianism, plus a particular <em>model</em> of human preferences.</p>
<h1>Some Applications</h1>
<p>So far, DNT made me somewhat more entrenched in my beliefs that</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href=""https://www.nickbostrom.com/astronomical/waste.html"">Astronomical waste</a> is indeed astronomically bad, because of the size of future supercivilization. Of course, in averagism the argument still has weight because of the high quality and long lifespan of future civilization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Factory farming is very bad. Although some may argue factory farmed animals have <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""h > 0""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">h</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">&gt;</span></span><span class=""mjx-mn MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">0</span></span></span></span></span></span>, it is much harder to argue they have <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""h > h_0""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">h</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">&gt;</span></span><span class=""mjx-msubsup MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">h</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mn"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">0</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>DNT made me somewhat update away from</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The traditional transhumanist perspective that living forever is good unless life quality is extremely bad. Of course, I still believe living forever is good when life quality is genuinely good. (Forever, or at least very long: I don't think we can fully comprehend the consequences of immortality from our present perspective.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The belief that the value of humanity so far has been net positive in terms of terminal values. I think a random person in the past had a rather miserable life, and ""but ey didn't commit suicide"" is no longer so convincing. However, I'm still pretty sure it is <em>instrumentally</em> net positive because of the potential of future utopia.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>DNT might also be useful for thinking about abortions, although it leaves open the thorny question of when a fetus becomes a moral patient. It does confirm that abortions are usually good when performed before this moment.</p>

<p>I'm having trouble finding a ""juicy"" passage to quote due to ... uh, genre differences? Skyrms isn't preaching about the True Nature of Language to a popular audience, but rather explaining game-theory models to an academic audience with occasional remarks about how these ideas apply to human language, animal behavior, cellular systems, <em>&amp;c.</em> The nine-page paper <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2689717/pdf/rstb20080258.pdf"">""Evolution of Signalling Systems with Multiple Senders and Receivers""</a> gives a much shorter taste of the technical content, but I don't anticipate you counting it as a precedent on its own, so I'll give my brief summary of some of what <em>I</em> got out of <a href=""https://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199580828.001.0001/acprof-9780199580828""><em>Signals: Evolution, Learning, and Information</em></a> and how it parallels Yudkowsky's work on <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/SGB7Y5WERh4skwtnb"">language</a> and <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6s3xABaXKPdFwA3FS/what-is-evidence"">evidence</a>.</p>
<p>(One could argue that the fact that I feel like I have to do my own summarizing rather than just quoting Skyrms is a hint that what I'm seeing, I got from Skyrms-reinterpreted-in-light-of-Yudkowsky, rather than it being easy to get from Skyrms himself. But I think the insight is mostly in the math, and the relative ease of juicy quoting is just a genre difference.)</p>
<p>Skyrms expounds on <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_signaling_game""><em>sender–receiver games</em></a> as introduced by David Lewis in 1969. We have two abstract agents, a ""sender"" and a ""receiver"". The sender gets to observe some state of Nature and send a ""signal"" to the receiver, who will then take some action, and get a payoff depending on the action taken and the state of Nature. For simplicity, suppose there are two states (<span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""S_1""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base"" style=""margin-right: -0.032em;""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em;

<p>And yet, if you run an evolutionary-game-theory simulation where behavior that gets payoffs is more likely to be copied, our agents learn to form one of the two consistent signaling systems where each of the signals corresponds to one of the states of Nature.</p>
<p>And that's where language comes from!! Starting with completely opaque, symmetric signals, the forces of evolution engineer <em>meaning</em> from nothing—where the ""meaning"" of a signal is just how it changes a receiver's probabilities. If you've read the Sequences, this should be familiar theme: <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/34XxbRFe54FycoCDw/the-bottom-line"">""the true import of a thing is its entanglement with other things""</a>.</p>
<p>There's a <em>lot</em> more to the book (what happens with more agents?—more signals?—what is deception?—how do new signals evolve? <em>&amp;c.</em>) but I hope this suffices to point out the parallel to Yudkowskian thought.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Skyrms's work appears to post-date Yudkowsky's</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I mean, yes, the specific book I'm citing was published in 2010 whereas the Sequences were 2007–2009, but <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Skyrms"">Brian Skyrms</a> has been doing this <em>style</em> of philosophy for <em>quite</em> a while, and I would be pretty surprised if he were an <em>Overcoming Bias</em> reader, so it seems like the kind of <em>causal</em> independence we're looking for when we talk about ""priority"", even if some of the publication dates overlap or are reversed? (I want to say, Skyrms and Yudkowsky are <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_independence"">conditionally independent</a> given Claude Shannon??)</p>

That conversation provided details on the views of central AI alignment research organizations and many of the ongoing research efforts for designing safe and aligned systems. Much has happened in the past twelve months, so we&apos;ve invited Rohin &#x2014; along with fellow researcher Buck Shlegeris &#x2014; back for a follow-up conversation. Today&apos;s episode focuses especially on the state of current research efforts for beneficial AI, as well as Buck&apos;s and Rohin&apos;s thoughts about the varying approaches and the difficulties we still face.

I&#x2019;m Lucas Perry. Today we have a special episode with Buck Shlegeris and Rohin Shah that serves as a review of progress in technical AI alignment over 2018 and 2019. This episode serves as an awesome birds eye view of the varying focus areas of technical AI alignment research and also helps to develop a sense of the field. I found this conversation to be super valuable for helping me to better understand the state and current trajectory of technical AI alignment research. This podcast covers traditional arguments for AI as an x-risk, what AI alignment is, the modeling of agents as expected utility maximizers, iterated distillation and amplification, AI safety via debate, agency and optimization, value learning, robustness, scaling to superhuman abilities, and more. The structure of this podcast is based on Rohin&#x2019;s AI Alignment Forum post titled AI Alignment 2018-19 Review. That post is an excellent resource to take a look at in addition to this podcast. Rohin also had a conversation with us about just a year ago titled An Overview of Technical AI Alignment with Rohin shah. This episode serves as a follow up to that overview and as an update to what&apos;s been going on in the field. You can find a link for it on the page for this episode.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p><p>Buck Shlegeris is a researcher at the Machine Intelligence Research Institute. He tries to work to make the future good for sentient beings and currently believes that working on existential risk from artificial intelligence is the best way of doing this. Buck worked as a software engineer at PayPal before joining MIRI, and was the first employee at Triplebyte. He previously studied at the Australian National University, majoring in CS and minoring in math and physics, and he has presented work on data structure synthesis at industry conferences.</p><p>Rohin Shah is a 6th year PhD student in Computer Science at the Center for Human-Compatible AI at UC Berkeley. He is involved in Effective Altruism and was the co-president of EA UC Berkeley for 2015-16 and ran EA UW during 2016-2017. Out of concern for animal welfare, Rohin is almost vegan because of the intense suffering on factory farms. He is interested in AI, machine learning, programming languages, complexity theory, algorithms, security, and quantum computing to name a few. Rohin&#x2019;s research focuses on building safe and aligned AI systems that pursue the objectives their users intend them to pursue, rather than the objectives that were literally specified. He also publishes the Alignment Newsletter, which summarizes work relevant to AI alignment. The Alignment Newsletter is something I highly recommend that you follow in addition to this podcast.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p><p>And with that, let&#x2019;s get into our review of AI alignment with Rohin Shah and Buck Shlegeris.</p><p>To get things started here, the plan is to go through Rohin&apos;s post on the Alignment Forum about AI Alignment 2018 and 2019 In Review. We&apos;ll be using this as a way of structuring this conversation and as a way of moving methodically through things that have changed or updated in 2018 and 2019, and to use those as a place for conversation. So then, Rohin, you can start us off by going through this document. Let&apos;s start at the beginning, and we&apos;ll move through sequentially and jump in where necessary or where there is interest.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>Sure, that sounds good. I think I started this out by talking about this basic analysis of AI risk that&apos;s been happening for the last couple of years. In particular, you have these traditional arguments, so maybe I&apos;ll just talk about the traditional argument first, which basically says that the AI systems that we&apos;re going to build are going to be powerful optimizers. When you optimize something, you tend to get these sort of edge case outcomes, these extreme outcomes that are a little hard to predict ahead of time.</p><p>You can&apos;t just rely on tests with less powerful systems in order to predict what will happen, and so you can&apos;t rely on your normal common sense reasoning in order to deal with this. In particular, powerful AI systems are probably going to look like expected utility maximizers due to various coherence arguments, like the Von Neumann&#x2013;Morgenstern rationality theorem, and these expected utility maximizers have convergent instrumental sub-goals, like not wanting to be switched off because then they can&apos;t achieve their goal, and wanting to accumulate a lot of power and resources.</p><p>The standard argument goes, because AI systems are going to be built this way, they will have these convergent instrumental sub-goals. This makes them dangerous because they will be pursuing goals that we don&apos;t want.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry: </strong>Before we continue too much deeper into this, I&apos;d want to actually start off with a really simple question for both of you. What is AI alignment?</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>Different people mean different things by it. When I use the word alignment, I&apos;m usually talking about what has been more specifically called intent alignment, which is basically aiming for the property that the AI system is trying to do what you want. It&apos;s trying to help you. Possibly it doesn&apos;t know exactly how to best help you, and it might make some mistakes in the process of trying to help you, but really what it&apos;s trying to do is to help you.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>The way I would say what I mean by AI alignment, I guess I would step back a little bit, and think about why it is that I care about this question at all. I think that the fundamental fact which has me interested in anything about powerful AI systems of the future is that I think they&apos;ll be a big deal in some way or another. And when I ask myself the question &#x201C;what are the kinds of things that could be problems about how these really powerful AI systems work or affect the world&#x201D;, one of the things which feels like a problem is that, we might not&#xA0; know how to apply these systems reliably to the kinds of problems which we care about, and so by default humanity will end up applying them in ways that lead to really bad outcomes. And so I guess, from that perspective, when I think about AI alignment, I think about trying to make ways of building AI systems such that we can apply them to tasks that are valuable, such that that they&apos;ll reliably pursue those tasks instead of doing something else which is really dangerous and bad.</p><p>I&#x2019;m fine with intent alignment as the focus. I kind of agree with, for instance, Paul Christiano, that it&apos;s not my problem if my AI system incompetently kills everyone, that&apos;s the capability&apos;s people&apos;s problem. I just want to make the system so it&apos;s trying to cause good outcomes.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry: </strong>Both of these understandings of what it means to build beneficial AI or aligned AI systems can take us back to what Rohin was just talking about, where there&apos;s this basic analysis of AI risk, about AI as powerful optimizers and the associated risks there. With that framing and those definitions, Rohin, can you take us back into this basic analysis of AI risk?</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>Sure. The traditional argument looks like AI systems are going to be goal-directed. If you expect that your AI system is going to be goal-directed, and that goal is not the one that humans care about, then it&apos;s going to be dangerous because it&apos;s going to try to gain power and resources with which to achieve its goal.</p><p>If the humans tried to turn it off, it&apos;s going to say, &quot;No, don&apos;t do that,&quot; and it&apos;s going to try to take actions that avoid that. So it pits the AI and the humans in an adversarial game with each other, and you ideally don&apos;t want to be fighting against a superintelligent AI system. That seems bad.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>I feel like Rohin is to some extent setting this up in a way that he&apos;s then going to argue is wrong, which I think is kind of unfair. In particular, Rohin, I think you&apos;re making these points about VNM theorems and stuff to set up the fact that it seems like these arguments don&apos;t actually work. I feel that this makes it kind of unfairly sound like the earlier AI alignment arguments are wrong. I think this is an incredibly important question, of whether early arguments about the importance of AI safety were quite flawed. My impression is that overall the early arguments about AI safety were pretty good. And I think it&apos;s a very interesting question whether this is in fact true. And I&apos;d be interested in arguing about it, but I think it&#x2019;s the kind of thing that ought to be argued about explicitly.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>Yeah, sure.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>And I get that you were kind of saying it narratively, so this is only a minor complaint. It&apos;s a thing I wanted to note.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>I think my position on that question of &#x201C;how good were the early AI risk arguments,&#x201D; probably people&apos;s internal beliefs were good as to why AI was supposed to be risky, and the things they wrote down were not very good. Some things were good and some things weren&apos;t. I think <a href=""https://intelligence.org/files/IEM.pdf"">Intelligence Explosion Microeconomics</a> was good. I think <a href=""https://intelligence.org/2016/12/28/ai-alignment-why-its-hard-and-where-to-start/"">AI Alignment: Why It&apos;s Hard and Where to Start</a>, was misleading.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>I think I agree with your sense that people probably had a lot of reasonable beliefs but that the written arguments seem flawed. I think another thing that&apos;s true is that random people like me who were on LessWrong in 2012 or something, ended up having a lot of really stupid beliefs about AI alignment, which I think isn&apos;t really the fault of the people who were thinking about it the best, but is maybe sociologically interesting.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>Yes, that seems plausible to me. Don&apos;t have a strong opinion on it.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry: </strong>To provide a little bit of framing here and better analysis of basic AI x-risk arguments, can you list what the starting arguments for AI risk were?</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>I think I am reasonably well portraying what the written arguments were. Underlying arguments that people probably had would be something more like, &quot;Well, it sure seems like if you want to do useful things in the world, you need to have AI systems that are pursuing goals.&quot; If you have something that&apos;s more like tool AI, like Google Maps, that system is going to be good at the one thing it was designed to do, but it&apos;s not going to be able to learn and then apply its knowledge to new tasks autonomously. It sure seems like if you want to do really powerful things in the world, like run companies or make policies, you probably do need AI systems that are constantly learning about their world and applying their knowledge in order to come up with new ways to do things.</p><p>In the history of human thought, we just don&apos;t seem to know of a way to cause that to happen except by putting goals in systems, and so probably AI systems are going to be goal-directed. And one way you can formalize goal-directedness is by thinking about expected utility maximizers, and people did a bunch of formal analysis of that. Mostly going to ignore it because I think you can just say all the same thing with the idea of pursuing goals and it&apos;s all fine.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>I think one important clarification to that, is you were saying the reason that tool AIs aren&apos;t just the whole story of what happens with AI is that you can&apos;t apply it to all problems. I think another important element is that people back then, and I now, believe that if you want to build a really good tool, you&apos;re probably going to end up wanting to structure that as an agent internally. And even if you aren&apos;t trying to structure it as an agent, if you&apos;re just searching over lots of different programs implicitly, perhaps by training a really large recurrent policy, you&apos;re going to end up finding something agent shaped.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>I don&apos;t disagree with any of that. I think we were using the words tool AI differently.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>Okay.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>In my mind, if we&apos;re talking about tool AI, we&apos;re imagining a pretty restricted action space where no matter what actions in this action space are taken, with high probability, nothing bad is going to happen. And you&apos;ll search within that action space, but you don&apos;t go to arbitrary action in the real world or something like that. This is what makes tool AI hard to apply to all problems.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>I would have thought that&apos;s a pretty non-standard use of the term tool AI.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>Possibly.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>In particular, I would have thought that restricting the action space enough that you&apos;re safe, regardless of how much it wants to hurt you, seems kind of non-standard.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>Yes. I have never really liked the concept of tool AI very much, so I kind of just want to move on.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry: </strong>Hey, It&#x2019;s post-podcast Lucas here. I just want to highlight here a little bit of clarification that Rohin was interested in adding, which is that he thinks that &#x201C;tool AI evokes a sense of many different properties that he doesn&apos;t know which properties most people are&#xA0; usually thinking about and as a result he prefers not to use the phrase tool AI. And instead would like to use more precise terminology. He doesn&#x2019;t necessarily feel though that the concepts underlying tool AI are useless.&#x201D; So let&apos;s tie things a bit back to these basic arguments for x-risk that many people are familiar with, that have to do with convergent instrumental sub-goals and the difficulty of specifying and aligning systems with our goals and what we actually care about in our preference hierarchies.</p><p>One of the things here that Buck was seeming to bring up, he was saying that you may have been narratively setting up the Von Neumann&#x2013;Morgenstern theorem, which sets up AIs as expected utility maximizers, and that you are going to argue that that argument, which is sort of the formalization of these earlier AI risk arguments, that that is less convincing to you now than it was before, but Buck still thinks that these arguments are strong. Could you unpack this a little bit more or am I getting this right?</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>To be clear, I also agree with Buck, that the spirit of the original arguments does seem correct, though, there are people who disagree with both of us about that. Basically, the VNM theorem roughly says, if you have preferences over a set of outcomes, and you satisfy some pretty intuitive axioms about how you make decisions, then you can represent your preferences using a utility function such that your decisions will always be, choose the action that maximizes the expected utility. This is, at least in writing, given as a reason to expect that AI systems would be maximizing expected utility. The thing is, when you talk about AI systems that are acting in the real world, they&apos;re just selecting a universe history, if you will. Any observed behavior is compatible with the maximization of some utility function. Utility functions are a really, really broad class of things when you apply it to choosing from universe histories.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>An intuitive example of this: suppose that you see that every day I walk home from work in a really inefficient way. It&apos;s impossible to know whether I&apos;m doing that because I happened to really like that path. For any sequence of actions that I take, there&#x2019;s some utility functions such that that was the optimal sequence of actions. And so we don&apos;t actually learn anything about how my policy is constrained based on the fact that I&apos;m an expected utility maximizer.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry: </strong>Right. If I only had access to your behavior and not your insides.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>Yeah, exactly. If you have a robot twitching forever, that&apos;s all it does, there is a utility function over a universe history that says that is the optimal thing to do. Every time the robot twitches to the right, it&apos;s like, yeah, the thing that was optimal to do at that moment in time was twitching to the right. If at some point somebody takes a hammer and smashes the robot and it breaks, then the utility function that corresponds to that being optimal is like, yeah, that was the exact right moment to break down.</p><p>If you have these pathologically complex utility functions as possibilities, every behavior is compatible with maximizing expected utility, you might want to say something like, probably we&apos;ll have the simple utility maximizers, but that&apos;s a pretty strong assumption, and you&apos;d need to justify it somehow. And the VNM theorem wouldn&apos;t let you do that.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry: </strong>So is the problem here that you&apos;re unable to fully extract human preference hierarchies from human behavior?</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>Well, you&apos;re unable to extract agent preferences from agent behavior. You can see any agent behavior and you can rationalize it as expected utility maximization, but it&apos;s not very useful. Doesn&apos;t give you predictive power.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>I just want to have my go at saying this argument in three sentences. Once upon a time, people said that because all rational systems act like they&apos;re maximizing an expected utility function, we should expect them to have various behaviors like trying to maximize the amount of power they have. But every set of actions that you could take is consistent with being an expected utility maximizer, therefore you can&apos;t use the fact that something is an expected utility maximizer in order to argue that it will have a particular set of behaviors, without making a bunch of additional arguments. And I basically think that I was wrong to be persuaded by the naive argument that Rohin was describing, which just goes directly from rational things are expected utility maximizers, to therefore rational things are power maximizing.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>To be clear, this was the thing I also believed. The main reason I wrote the post that argued against it was because I spent half a year under the delusion that this was a valid argument.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry: </strong>Just for my understanding here, the view is that because any behavior, any agent from the outside can be understood as being an expected utility maximizer, that there are behaviors that clearly do not do instrumental sub-goal things, like maximize power and resources, yet those things can still be viewed as expected utility maximizers from the outside. So additional arguments are required for why expected utility maximizers do instrumental sub-goal things, which are AI risky.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>Yeah, that&apos;s exactly right.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry: </strong>Okay. What else is on offer other than expected utility maximizers? You guys talked about comprehensive AI services might be one. Are there other formal agentive classes of &apos;thing that is not an expected utility maximizer but still has goals?&apos;</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>A formalism for that? I think some people like John Wentworth is for example, thinking about markets as a model of agency. Some people like to think of multi-agent groups together leading to an emergent agency and want to model human minds this way. How formal are these? Not that formal yet.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>I don&apos;t think there&apos;s anything which is competitively popular with expected utility maximization as the framework for thinking about this stuff.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>Oh yes, certainly not. Expected utility maximization is used everywhere. Nothing else comes anywhere close.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry: </strong>So there&apos;s been this complete focus on utility functions and representing the human utility function, whatever that means. Do you guys think that this is going to continue to be the primary way of thinking about and modeling human preference hierarchies? How much does it actually relate to human preference hierarchies? I&apos;m wondering if it might just be substantially different in some way.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>Me and Rohin are going to disagree about this. I think that trying to model human preferences as a utility function is really dumb and bad and will not help you do things that are useful. I don&apos;t know; If I want to make an AI that&apos;s incredibly good at recommending me movies that I&apos;m going to like, some kind of value learning thing where it tries to learn my utility function over movies is plausibly a good idea. Even things where I&apos;m trying to use an AI system as a receptionist, I can imagine value learning being a good idea.</p><p>But I feel extremely pessimistic about more ambitious value learning kinds of things, where I try to, for example, have an AI system which learns human preferences and then acts in large scale ways in the world. I basically feel pretty pessimistic about every alignment strategy which goes via that kind of a route. I feel much better about either trying to not use AI systems for problems where you have to think about large scale human preferences, or having an AI system which does something more like modeling what humans would say in response to various questions and then using that directly instead of trying to get a value function out of it.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: Y</strong>eah. Funnily enough, I was going to start off by saying I think Buck and I are going to agree on this.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris:</strong> Oh.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>And I think I mostly agree with the things that you said. The thing I was going to say was I feel pretty pessimistic about trying to model the normative underlying human values, where you have to get things like population ethics right, and what to do with the possibility of infinite value. How do you deal with fanaticism? What&apos;s up with moral uncertainty? I feel pretty pessimistic about any sort of scheme that involves figuring that out before developing human-level AI systems.</p><p>There&apos;s a related concept which is also called value learning, which I would prefer to be called something else, but I feel like the name&apos;s locked in now. In my sequence, I called it narrow value learning, but even that feels bad. Maybe at least for this podcast we could call it specification learning, which is sort of more like the tasks Buck mentioned, like if you want to learn preferences over movies, representing that using a utility function seems fine.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry: </strong>Like superficial preferences?</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>Sure. I usually think of it as you have in mind a task that you want your AI system to do, and now you have to get your AI system to reliably do it. It&apos;s unclear whether this should even be called a value learning at this point. Maybe it&apos;s just the entire alignment problem. But techniques like inverse reinforcement learning, preference learning, learning from corrections, inverse reward design where you learn from a proxy reward, all of these are more trying to do the thing where you have a set of behaviors in mind, and you want to communicate that to the agent.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>The way that I&apos;ve been thinking about how optimistic I should be about value learning or specification learning recently has been that I suspect that at the point where AI is human level, by default we&apos;ll have value learning which is about at human level. We&apos;re about as good at giving AI systems information about our preferences that it can do stuff with as we are giving other humans information about our preferences that we can do stuff with. And when I imagine hiring someone to recommend music to me, I feel like there are probably music nerds who could do a pretty good job of looking at my Spotify history, and recommending bands that I&apos;d like if they spent a week on it. I feel a lot more pessimistic about being able to talk to a philosopher for a week, and then them answer hard questions about my preferences, especially if they didn&apos;t have the advantage of already being humans themselves.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>Yep. That seems right.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>So maybe that&apos;s how I would separate out the specification learning stuff that I feel optimistic about from the more ambitious value learning stuff that I feel pretty pessimistic about.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>I do want to note that I collated a bunch of stuff arguing against ambitious value learning. If I had to make a case for optimism about even that approach, it would look more like, &quot;Under the value learning approach, it seems possible with uncertainty over rewards, values, preferences, whatever you want to call them to get an AI system such that you actually are able to change it, because it would reason that if you&apos;re trying to change it, well then that means something about it is currently not good for helping you and so it would be better to let itself be changed. I&apos;m not very convinced by this argument.&quot;</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>I feel like if you try to write down four different utility functions that the agent is uncertain between, I think it&apos;s just actually really hard for me to imagine concrete scenarios where the AI is corrigible as a result of its uncertainty over utility functions. Imagine the AI system thinks that you&apos;re going to switch it off and replace it with an AI system which has a different method of inferring values from your actions and your words. It&apos;s not going to want to let you do that, because its utility function is to have the world be the way that is expressed by your utility function as estimated the way that it approximates utility functions. And so being replaced by a thing which estimates utility functions or infers utility functions some other way means that it&apos;s very unlikely to get what it actually wants, and other arguments like this. I&apos;m not sure if these are super old arguments that you&apos;re five levels of counter-arguments to.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>I definitely know this argument. I think the problem of fully updated deference is what I would normally point to as representing this general class of claims and I think it&apos;s a good counter argument. When I actually think about this, I sort of start getting confused about what it means for an AI system to terminally value the final output of what its value learning system would do. It feels like some additional notion of how the AI chooses actions has been posited, that hasn&apos;t actually been captured in the model and so I feel fairly uncertain about all of these arguments and kind of want to defer to the future.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>I think the thing that I&apos;m describing is just what happens if you read the algorithm literally. Like, if you read the value learning algorithm literally, it has this notion of the AI system wants to maximize the human&apos;s actual utility function.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>For an optimal agent playing a CIRL (cooperative inverse reinforcement learning) game, I agree with your argument. If you take optimality as defined in the cooperative inverse reinforcement learning paper and it&apos;s playing over a long period of time, then yes, it&apos;s definitely going to prefer to keep itself in charge rather than a different AI system that would infer values in a different way.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry: </strong>It seems like so far utility functions are the best way of trying to get an understanding of what human beings care about and value and have preferences over, you guys are bringing up all of the difficult intricacies with trying to understand and model human preferences as utility functions. One of the things that you also bring up here, Rohin, in your review, is the risk of lock-in, which may require us to solve hard philosophical problems before the development of AGI. That has something to do with ambitious value learning, which would be like learning the one true human utility function which probably just doesn&apos;t exist.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>I think I want to object to a little bit of your framing there. My stance on utility functions of humans isn&apos;t that there are a bunch of complicated subtleties on top, it&apos;s that modeling humans with utility functions is just a really sad state to be in. If your alignment strategy involves positing that humans behave as expected utility maximizers, I am very pessimistic about it working in the short term, and I just think that we should be trying to completely avoid anything which does that. It&apos;s not like there&apos;s a bunch of complicated sub-problems that we need to work out about how to describe us as expected utility maximizers, my best guess is that we would just not end up doing that because it&apos;s not a good idea.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry: </strong>For the ambitious value learning?</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>Yeah, that&apos;s right.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry: </strong>Okay, do you have something that&apos;s on offer?</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>The two options instead of that, which seem attractive to me? As I said earlier, one is you just convince everyone to not use AI systems for things where you need to have an understanding of large scale human preferences. The other one is the kind of thing that Paul Christiano&apos;s iterated distillation and amplification, or a variety of his other ideas, the kind of thing that he&apos;s trying to get there is, I think, if you make a really powerful AI system, it&apos;s actually going to have an excellent model of human values in whatever representation is best for actually making predictions about&#xA0; humans because a really excellent AGI, like a really excellent paperclip maximizer, it&apos;s really important for it to really get how humans work so that it can manipulate them into letting it build lots of paperclip factories or whatever.</p><p>So I think that if you think that we have AGI, then by assumption I think we have a system which is able to reason about human values if it wants. And so if we can apply these really powerful AI systems to tasks such that the things that they do display their good understanding of human values, then we&apos;re fine and it&apos;s just okay that there was no way that we could represent a utility function directly. So for instance, the idea in IDA is that if we could have this system which is just trying to answer questions the same way that humans would, but enormously more cheaply because it can run faster than humans and a few other tricks, then we don&apos;t have to worry about writing down a utility functions of humans directly because we can just make the system do things that are kind of similar to the things humans would have done, and so it implicitly has this human utility function built into it. That&apos;s option two. Option one is don&apos;t use anything that requires a complex human utility function, option two is have your systems learn human values implicitly, by giving them a task such that this is beneficial for them and such that their good understanding of human values comes out in their actions.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>One way I might condense that point, is that you&apos;re asking for a nice formalism for human preferences and I just point to all the humans out there in the world who don&apos;t know anything about utility functions, which is 99% of them and nonetheless still seem pretty good at inferring human preferences.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry: </strong>On this part about AGI, if it is AGI it should be able to reason about human preferences, then why would it not be able to construct something that was more explicit and thus was able to do more ambitious value learning?</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>So it can totally do that, itself. But we can&apos;t force that structure from the outside with our own algorithms.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>Image classification is a good analogy. Like, in the past we were using hand engineered features, namely SIFT and HOG and then training classifiers over these hand engineered features in order to do image classification. And then we came to the era of deep learning and we just said, yeah, throw away all those features and just do everything end to end with a convolutional neural net and it worked way better. The point was that, in fact there are good representations for most tasks and humans trying to write them down ahead of time just doesn&apos;t work very well at that. It tends to work better if you let the AI system discover its own representations that best capture the thing you wanted to capture.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry: </strong>Can you unpack this point a little bit more? I&apos;m not sure that I&apos;m completely understanding it. Buck is rejecting this modeling human beings explicitly as expected utility maximizers and trying to explicitly come up with utility functions in our AI systems. The first was to convince people not to use these kinds of things. And the second is to make it so that the behavior and output of the AI systems has some implicit understanding of human behavior. Can you unpack this a bit more for me or give me another example?</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>So here&apos;s another example. Let&apos;s say I was teaching my kid that I don&apos;t have, how to catch a ball. It seems that the formalism that&apos;s available to me for learning how to catch a ball is, well, you can go all the way down to look at our best models of physics, we could use Newtonian mechanics let&apos;s say, like here are these equations, estimate the velocity and the distance of the ball and the angle at which it&apos;s thrown plug that into these equations and then predict that the ball&apos;s going to come here and then just put your hand there and then magically catch it. We won&apos;t even talk about the catching part. That seems like a pretty shitty way to teach a kid how to catch a ball.</p><p>Probably it&apos;s just a lot better to just play catch with the kid for a while and let the kid&apos;s brain figure out this is how to predict where the ball is going to go such that I can predict where it&apos;s going to be and then catch it.</p><p>I&apos;m basically 100% confident that the thing that the brain is doing is not Newtonian mechanics. It&apos;s doing something else that&apos;s just way more efficient at predicting where the ball is going to be so that I can catch it and if I forced the brain to use Newtonian mechanics, I bet it would not do very well at this task.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>I feel like that still isn&apos;t quite saying the key thing here. I don&apos;t know how to say this off the top of my head either, but I think there&apos;s this key point about: just because your neural net can learn a particular feature of the world doesn&apos;t mean that you can back out some other property of the world by forcing the neural net to have a particular shape. Does that make any sense, Rohin?</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>Yeah, vaguely. I mean, well, no, maybe not.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>The problem isn&apos;t just the capabilities problem. There&apos;s this way you can try and infer a human utility function by asking, according to this model, what&apos;s the maximum likelihood utility function given all these things the human did. If you have a good enough model, you will in fact end up making very good predictions about the human, it&apos;s just that the decomposition into their planning function and their utility function is not going to result in a utility function which is anything like a thing that I would want maximized if this process was done on me. There is going to be some decomposition like this, which is totally fine, but the utility function part just isn&apos;t going to correspond to the thing that I want.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>Yeah, that is also a problem, but I agree that is not the thing I was describing.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry: </strong>Is the point there that there&apos;s a lack of alignment between the utility function and the planning function. Given that the planning function imperfectly optimizes the utility function.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>It&apos;s more like there are just infinitely many possible pairs of planning functions and utility functions that exactly predict human behavior. Even if it were true that humans were expected utility maximizers, which Buck is arguing we&apos;re not, and I agree with him. There is a planning function that&apos;s like humans are perfectly anti-rational and if you&apos;re like what utility function works with that planner to predict human behavior. Well, the literal negative of the true utility function when combined with the anti-rational planner produces the same behavior as the true utility function with the perfect planner, there&apos;s no information that lets you distinguish between these two possibilities.</p><p>You have to build it in as an assumption. I think Buck&apos;s point is that building things in as assumptions is probably not going to work.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>Yeah.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>A point I agree with. In philosophy this is called the is-ought problem, right? What you can train your AI system on is a bunch of &#x201C;is&#x201D; facts and then you have to add in some assumptions in order to jump to &#x201C;ought&#x201D; facts, which is what the utility function is trying to do. The utility function is trying to tell you how you ought to behave in new situations and the point of the is-ought distinction is that you need some bridging assumptions in order to get from is to ought.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>And I guess an important part here is your system will do an amazing job of answering &#x201C;is&#x201D; questions about what humans would say about &#x201C;ought&#x201D; questions. And so I guess maybe you could phrase the second part as: to get your system to do things that match human preferences, use the fact that it knows how to make accurate &#x201C;is&#x201D; statements about humans&apos; ought statements?</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry: </strong>It seems like we&apos;re strictly talking about inferring the human utility function or preferences via looking at behavior. What if you also had more access to the actual structure of the human&apos;s brain?</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>This is like the approach that Stuart Armstrong likes to talk about. The same things still apply. You still have the is-ought problem where the facts about the brain are &quot;is&quot; facts and how you translate that into &quot;ought&quot; facts is going to involve some assumptions. Maybe you can break down such assumptions that everyone would agree with. Maybe it&apos;s like if this particular neuron in a human brain spikes, that&apos;s a good thing and we want more of it and if this other one spikes, that&apos;s a bad thing. We don&apos;t want it. Maybe that assumption is fine.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry: </strong>I guess I&apos;m just pointing out, if you could find the places in the human brain that generate the statements about Ought questions.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>As Buck said, that lets you predict what humans would say about ought statements, which your assumption could then be, whatever humans say about ought statements, that&apos;s what you ought to do. And that&apos;s still an assumption. Maybe it&apos;s a very reasonable assumption that we&apos;re happy to put it into our AI system.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry: </strong>If we&apos;re not willing to accept some humans&#x2019; &#x201C;is&#x201D; statements about &#x201C;ought&#x201D; questions then we have to do some meta-ethical moral policing in our assumptions around getting &#x201C;is&#x201D; statements from &#x201C;ought&#x201D; questions.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>Yes, that seems right to me. I don&apos;t know how you would do such a thing, but you would have to do something along those lines.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>I would additionally say that I feel pretty great about trying to do things which use the fact that we can trust our AI to have good &#x201C;is&#x201D; answers to &#x201C;ought&#x201D; questions, but there&apos;s a bunch of problems with this. I think it&apos;s a good starting point but trying to use that to do arbitrarily complicated things in the world has a lot of problems. For instance, suppose I&apos;m trying to decide whether we should design a city this way or that way. It&apos;s hard to know how to go from the ability to know how humans would answer questions about preferences to knowing what you should do to design the city. And this is for a bunch of reasons, one of them is that the human might not be able to figure out from your city building plans what the city&apos;s going to actually be like. And another is that the human might give inconsistent answers about what design is good, depending on how you phrase the question, such that if you try to figure out a good city plan by optimizing for the thing that the human is going to be most enthusiastic about, then you might end up with a bad city plan. Paul Christiano has written in a lot of detail about a lot of this.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry: </strong>That also reminds me of what Stuart Armstrong wrote about the framing on the questions changing output on the preference.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>Yep.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>Sorry, to be clear other people than Paul Christiano have also written a lot about this stuff, (including Rohin). My favorite writing about this stuff is by Paul.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry: </strong>Yeah, those do seem problematic but it would also seem that there would be further &#x201C;is&#x201D; statements that if you queried people&apos;s meta-preferences about those things, you would get more &#x201C;is&#x201D; statements about that, but then that just pushes the &#x201C;ought&#x201D; assumptions that you need to make further back. Getting into very philosophically weedy territory. Do you think that this kind of thing could be pushed to the long reflection as is talked about by William MacAskill and Toby Ord or how much of this do you actually think needs to be solved in order to have safe and aligned AGI?</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>I think there are kind of two different ways that you could hope to have good outcomes from AGI. One is: set up a world such that you never needed to make an AGI which can make large scale decisions about the world. And two is: solve the full alignment problem.</p><p>I&apos;m currently pretty pessimistic about the second of those being technically feasible. And I&apos;m kind of pretty pessimistic about the first of those being a plan that will work. But in the world where you can have everyone only apply powerful and dangerous AI systems in ways that don&apos;t require an understanding of human values, then you can push all of these problems onto the long reflection. In worlds where you can do arbitrarily complicated things in ways that humans would approve of, you don&apos;t really need to long reflect this stuff because of the fact that these powerful AI systems already have the capacity of doing portions of the long reflection work inside themselves as needed. (<a href=""https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/H2zno3ggRJaph9P6c/quotes-about-the-long-reflection"">Quotes about the long reflection</a>)&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>Yeah, so I think my take, it&apos;s not exactly disagreeing with Buck. It&apos;s more like from a different frame as Buck&apos;s. If you just got AI systems that did the things that humans did now, this does not seem to me to obviously require solving hard problems in philosophy. That&apos;s the lower bound on what you can do before having to do long reflection type stuff. Eventually you do want to do a longer reflection. I feel relatively optimistic about having a technical solution to alignment that allows us to do the long reflection after building AI systems. So the long reflection would include both humans and AI systems thinking hard, reflecting on difficult problems and so on.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>To be clear, I&apos;m super enthusiastic about there being a long reflection or something along those lines.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry: </strong>I always find it useful reflecting on just how human beings do many of these things because I think that when thinking about things in the strict AI alignment sense, it can seem almost impossible, but human beings are able to do so many of these things without solving all of these difficult problems. It seems like in the very least, we&apos;ll be able to get AI systems that very, very approximately do what is good or what is approved of by human beings because we can already do that.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>That argument doesn&apos;t really make sense to me. It also didn&apos;t make sense when Rohin referred to it a minute ago.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>It&apos;s not an argument for we technically know how to do this. It is more an argument for this as at least within the space of possibilities.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry: </strong>Yeah, I guess that&apos;s how I was also thinking of it. It is within the space of possibilities. So utility functions are good because they can be optimized for, and there seem to be risks with optimization. Is there anything here that you guys would like to say about better understanding agency? I know this is one of the things that is important within the MIRI agenda.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>I am a bad MIRI employee. I don&apos;t really get that part of the MIRI agenda, and so I&apos;m not going to defend it. I have certainly learned some interesting things from talking to Scott Garrabrant and other MIRI people who have lots of interesting thoughts about this stuff. I don&apos;t quite see the path from there to good alignment strategies. But I also haven&apos;t spent a super long time thinking about it because I, in general, don&apos;t try to think about all of the different AI alignment things that I could possibly think about.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>Yeah. I also am not a good person to ask about this. Most of my knowledge comes from reading things and MIRI has stopped writing things very much recently, so I don&apos;t know what their ideas are. I, like Buck, don&apos;t really see a good alignment strategy that starts with, first we understand optimization and so that&apos;s the main reason why I haven&apos;t looked into it very much.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>I think I don&apos;t actually agree with the thing you said there, Rohin. I feel like understanding optimization could plausibly be really nice. Basically the story there is, it&apos;s a real bummer if we have to make really powerful AI systems via searching over large recurrent policies for things that implement optimizers. If it turned out that we could figure out some way of coding up optimizer stuffs directly, then this could maybe mean you didn&apos;t need to make mesa-optimizers. And maybe this means that your inner alignment problems go away, which could be really nice. The thing that I was saying I haven&apos;t thought that much about is, the relevance of thinking about, for instance, the various weirdnesses that happen when you consider embedded agency or decision theory, and things like that.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>Oh, got it. Yeah. I think I agree that understanding optimization would be great if we succeeded at it and I&apos;m mostly pessimistic about us succeeding at it, but also there are people who are optimistic about it and I don&apos;t know why they&apos;re optimistic about it.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry: </strong>Hey it&#x2019;s post-podcast Lucas here again. So, I just want to add a little more detail here again on behalf of Rohin. Here he feels pessimistic about us understanding optimization well enough and in a short enough time period that we are able to create powerful optimizers that we understand that rival the performance of the AI systems we&#x2019;re already building and will build in the near future. Back to the episode.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>The arguments that MIRI has made about this,... they think that there are a bunch of questions about what optimization is, that are plausibly just not that hard compared to other problems which small groups of people have occasionally solved, like coming up with foundations of mathematics, kind of a big conceptual deal but also a relatively small group of people. And before we had formalizations of math, I think it might&apos;ve seemed as impossible to progress on as formalizing optimization or coming up with a better picture of that. So maybe that&apos;s my argument for some optimism.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>Yeah, I think pointing to some examples of great success does not imply... Like there are probably many similar things that didn&apos;t work out and we don&apos;t know about them cause nobody bothered to tell us about them because they failed. Seems plausible maybe.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry: </strong>So, exploring more deeply this point of agency can either, or both of you, give us a little bit of a picture about the relevance or non relevance of decision theory here to AI alignment and I think, Buck, you mentioned the trickiness of embedded decision theory.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>If you go back to our traditional argument for AI risk, it&apos;s basically powerful AI systems will be very strong optimizers. They will possibly be misaligned with us and this is bad. And in particular one specific way that you might imagine this going wrong is this idea of mesa optimization where we don&apos;t know how to build optimizers right now. And so what we end up doing is basically search across a huge number of programs looking for ones that do well at optimization and use that as our AGI system. And in this world, if you buy that as a model of what&apos;s happening, then you&apos;ll basically have almost no control over what exactly that system is optimizing for. And that seems like a recipe for misalignment. It sure would be better if we could build the optimizer directly and know what it is optimizing for. And in order to do that, we need to know how to do optimization well.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry: </strong>What are the kinds of places that we use mesa optimizers today?</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>It&apos;s not used very much yet. The field of meta learning is the closest example. In the field of meta learning you have a distribution over tasks and you use gradient descent or some other AI technique in order to find an AI system that itself, once given a new task, learns how to perform that task well.</p><p>Existing meta learning systems are more like learning how to do all the tasks well and then when they&apos;ll see a new task they just figure out ah, it&apos;s this task and then they roll out the policy that they already learned. But the eventual goal for meta learning is to get something that, online, learns how to do the task without having previously figured out how to do that task.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry: </strong>Okay, so Rohin did what you say cover embedded decision theory?</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>No, not really. I think embedded decision theory is just, we want to understand optimization. Our current notion of optimization, one way you could formalize it is to say my AI agent is going to have Bayesian belief over all the possible ways that the environment could be. It&apos;s going to update that belief over time as it gets observations and then it&apos;s going to act optimally with respect to that belief, by maximizing its expected utility. And embedded decision theory basically calls into question the idea that there&apos;s a separation between the agent and the environment. In particular I, as a human, couldn&apos;t possibly have a Bayesian belief about the entire earth because the entire Earth contains me. I can&apos;t have a Bayesian belief over myself so this means that our existing formalization of agency is flawed. It can&apos;t capture these things that affect real agents. And embedded decision theory, embedded agency, more broadly, is trying to deal with this fact and have a new formalization that works even in these situations.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>I want to give my understanding of the pitch for it. One part is that if you don&apos;t understand embedded agency, then if you try to make an AI system in a hard coded way, like making a hard coded optimizer, traditional phrasings of what an optimizer is, are just literally wrong in that, for example, they&apos;re assuming that you have these massive beliefs over world states that you can&apos;t really have. And plausibly, it is really bad to try to make systems by hardcoding assumptions that are just clearly false. And so if we want to hardcode agents with particular properties, it would be good if we knew a way of coding the agent that isn&apos;t implicitly making clearly false assumptions.</p><p>And the second pitch for it is something like when you want to understand a topic, sometimes it&apos;s worth looking at something about the topic which you&apos;re definitely wrong about, and trying to think about that part until you are less confused about it. When I&apos;m studying physics or something, a thing that I love doing is looking for the easiest question whose answer I don&apos;t know, and then trying to just dive in until I have satisfactorily answered that question, hoping that the practice that I get about thinking about physics from answering a question correctly will generalize to much harder questions. I think that&apos;s part of the pitch here. Here is a problem that we would need to answer, if we wanted to understand how superintelligent AI systems work, so we should try answering it because it seems easier than some of the other problems.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry: </strong>Okay. I think I feel satisfied. The next thing here Rohin in your AI alignment 2018-19 review is value learning. I feel like we&apos;ve talked a bunch about this already. Is there anything here that you want to say or do you want to skip this?</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>One thing we didn&apos;t cover is, if you have uncertainty over what you&apos;re supposed to optimize, this turns into an interactive sort of game between the human and the AI agent, which seems pretty good. A priori you should expect that there&apos;s going to need to be a lot of interaction between the human and the AI system in order for the AI system to actually be able to do the things that the human wants it to do. And so having formalisms and ideas of where this interaction naturally falls out seems like a good thing.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>I&apos;ve said a lot of things about how I am very pessimistic about value learning as a strategy. Nevertheless it seems like it might be really good for there to be people who are researching this, and trying to get as good as we can get at improving sample efficiency so that can have your AI systems understand your preferences over music with as little human interaction as possible, just in case it turns out to be possible to solve the hard version of value learning. Because a lot of the engineering effort required to make ambitious value learning work will plausibly be in common with the kinds of stuff you have to do to make these more simple specification learning tasks work out. That&apos;s a reason for me to be enthusiastic about people researching value learning even if I&apos;m pessimistic about the overall thing working.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry: </strong>All right, so what is robustness and why does it matter?</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>Robustness is one of those words that doesn&apos;t super clearly have a definition and people use it differently. Robust agents don&apos;t fail catastrophically in situations slightly different from the ones that they were designed for. One example of a case where we see a failure of robustness currently, is in adversarial examples for image classifiers, where it is possible to take an image, make a slight perturbation to it, and then the resulting image is completely misclassified. You take a correctly classified image of a Panda, slightly perturb it such that a human can&apos;t tell what the difference is, and then it&apos;s classified as a gibbon with 99% confidence. Admittedly this was with an older image classifier. I think you need to make the perturbations a bit larger now in order to get them.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry: </strong>This is because the relevant information that it uses are very local to infer panda-ness rather than global properties of the panda?</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>It&apos;s more like they&#x2019;re high frequency features or imperceptible features. There&apos;s a lot of controversy about this but there is a pretty popular recent paper that I believe, but not everyone believes, that claims that this was because they&apos;re picking up on real imperceptible features that do generalize to the test set, that humans can&apos;t detect. That&apos;s an example of robustness. Recently people have been applying this to reinforcement learning both by adversarially modifying the observations that agents get and also by training agents that act in the environment adversarially towards the original agent. One paper out of CHAI showed that there&apos;s this kick and defend environment where you&apos;ve got two MuJoCo robots. One of them is kicking a soccer ball. The other one&apos;s a goalie, that&apos;s trying to prevent the kicker from successfully shooting a goal, and they showed that if you do self play in order to get kickers and defenders and then you take the kicker, you freeze it, you don&apos;t train it anymore and you retrain a new defender against this kicker.</p><p>What is the strategy that this new defender learns? It just sort of falls to the ground and flaps about in a random looking way and the kicker just gets so confused that it usually fails to even touch the ball and so this is sort of an adversarial example for RL agents now, it&apos;s showing that even they&apos;re not very robust.</p><p>There was also a paper out of DeepMind that did the same sort of thing. For their adversarial attack they learned what sorts of mistakes the agent would make early on in training and then just tried to replicate those mistakes once the agent was fully trained and they found that this helped them uncover a lot of bad behaviors. Even at the end of training.</p><p>From the perspective of alignment, it&apos;s clear that we want robustness. It&apos;s not exactly clear what we want robustness to. This robustness to adversarial perturbations was kind of a bit weird as a threat model. If there is an adversary in the environment they&#x2019;re probably not going to be restricted to small perturbations. They&apos;re probably not going to get white box access to your AI system; even if they did, this doesn&apos;t seem to really connect with the AI system as adversarially optimizing against humans story, which is how we get to the x-risk part, so it&apos;s not totally clear.</p><p>I think on the intent alignment case, which is the thing that I usually think about, you mostly want to ensure that whatever is driving the &quot;motivation&quot; of the AI system, you want that to be very robust. You want it to agree with what humans would want in all situations or at least all situations that are going to come up or something like that. Paul Christiano has written a few blog posts about this that talk about what techniques he&apos;s excited about solving that problem, which boil down to interpretability, adversarial training, and improving adversarial training through relaxations of the problem.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>I&apos;m pretty confused about this, and so it&apos;s possible what I&apos;m going to say is dumb. When I look at problems with robustness or problems that Rohin put in this robustness category here, I want to divide it into two parts. One of the parts is, things that I think of as capability problems, which I kind of expect the rest of the world will need to solve on its own. For instance, things about safe exploration, how do I get my system to learn to do good things without ever doing really bad things, this just doesn&apos;t seem very related to the AI alignment problem to me. And I also feel reasonably optimistic that you can solve it by doing dumb techniques which don&apos;t have anything too difficult to them, like you can have your system so that it has a good model of the world that it got from unsupervised learning somehow and then it never does dumb enough things. And also I don&apos;t really see that kind of robustness problem leading to existential catastrophes. And the other half of robustness is the half that I care about a lot, which in my mind, is mostly trying to make sure that you succeeded at inner alignment. That is, that the mesa optimizers you&apos;ve found through gradient descent have goals that actually match your goals.</p><p>This is like robustness in the sense that you&apos;re trying to guarantee that in every situation, your AI system, as Rohin was saying, is intent aligned with you. It&apos;s trying to do the kind of thing that you want. And I worry that, by default, we&apos;re going to end up with AI systems not intent aligned, so there exist a bunch of situations they can be put in such that they do things that are very much not what you&apos;d want, and therefore they fail at robustness. I think this is a really important problem, it&apos;s like half of the AI safety problem or more, in my mind, and I&apos;m not very optimistic about being able to solve it with prosaic techniques.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>That sounds roughly similar to what I was saying. Yes.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>I don&apos;t think we disagree about this super much except for the fact that I think you seem to care more about safe exploration and similar stuff than I think I do.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>I think safe exploration&apos;s a bad example. I don&apos;t know what safe exploration is even trying to solve but I think other stuff, I agree. I do care about it more. One place where I somewhat disagree with you is, you sort of have this point about all these robustness problems are the things that the rest of the world has incentives to figure out, and will probably figure out. That seems true for alignment too, it sure seems like you want your system to be aligned in order to do the things that you actually want. Everyone that has an incentive for this to happen. I totally expect people who aren&#x2019;t EAs or rationalists or weird longtermists to be working on AI alignment in the future and to some extent even now. I think that&apos;s one thing.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>You should say your other thing, but then I want to get back to that point.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>The other thing is I think I agree with you that it&apos;s not clear to me how failures of the robustness of things other than motivation lead to x-risk, but I&apos;m more optimistic than you are that our solutions to those kinds of robustness will help with the solutions to &quot;motivation robustness&quot; or how to make your mesa optimizer aligned.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>Yeah, sorry, I guess I actually do agree with that last point. I am very interested in trying to figure out how to have aligned to mesa optimizers, and I think that a reasonable strategy to pursue in order to get aligned mesa optimizers is trying to figure out how to make your image classifiers robust to adversarial examples. I think you probably won&apos;t succeed even if you succeed with the image classifiers, but it seems like the image classifiers are still probably where you should start. And I guess if we can&apos;t figure out how to make image classifiers robust to adversarial examples in like 10 years, I&apos;m going to be super pessimistic about the harder robustness problem, and that would be great to know.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>For what it&apos;s worth, my take on the adversarial examples of image classifiers is, we&apos;re going to train image classifiers on more data with bigger nets, it&apos;s just going to mostly go away. Prediction. I&apos;m laying my cards on the table.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>That&apos;s also something like my guess.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>Okay.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>My prediction is: to get image classifiers that are robust to epsilon ball perturbations or whatever, some combination of larger things and adversarial training and a couple other clever things, will probably mean that we have robust image classifiers in 5 or 10 years at the latest.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>Cool. And you wanted to return to the other point about the world having incentives to do alignment.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>So I don&apos;t quite know how to express this, but I think it&apos;s really important which is going to make this a really fun experience for everyone involved. You know how Airbnb... Or sorry, I guess a better example of this is actually Uber drivers. Where I give basically every Uber driver a five star rating, even though some Uber drivers are just clearly more pleasant for me than others, and Uber doesn&apos;t seem to try very hard to get around these problems, even though I think that if Uber caused there to be a 30% difference in pay between the drivers who I think of as 75th percentile and the drivers I think of as 25th percentile, this would make the service probably noticeably better for me. I guess it seems to me that a lot of the time the world just doesn&apos;t try do kind of complicated things to make systems actually aligned, and it just does hack jobs, and then everyone deals with the fact that everything is unaligned as a result.</p><p>To draw this analogy back, I think that we&apos;re likely to have the kind of alignment techniques that solve problems that are as simple and obvious as: we should have a way to have rate your hosts on Airbnb. But I&apos;m worried that we won&apos;t ever get around to solving the problems that are like, but what if your hosts are incentivized to tell you sob stories such that you give them good ratings, even though actually they were worse than some other hosts. And this is never a big enough deal that people are unilaterally individually incentivized to solve the harder version of the alignment problem, and then everyone ends up using these systems that actually aren&apos;t aligned in the strong sense and then we end up in a doomy world. I&apos;m curious if any of that made any sense.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry: </strong>Is a simple way to put that we fall into inadequate or an unoptimal equilibrium and then there&apos;s tragedy of the commons and bad game theory stuff that happens that keeps us locked and that the same story could apply to alignment?</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>Yeah, that&apos;s not quite what I mean.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry: </strong>Okay.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>I think Buck&apos;s point is that actually Uber or Airbnb could unilaterally, no gains required, make their system better and this would be an improvement for them and everyone else, and they don&apos;t do it. There is nothing about equilibrium that is a failure of Uber to do this thing that seems so obviously good.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>I&apos;m not actually claiming that it&apos;s better for Uber, I&apos;m just claiming that there is a misalignment there. Plausibly, an Uber exec, if they were listening to this they&apos;d just be like, &quot;LOL, that&apos;s a really stupid idea. People would hate it.&quot; And then they would say more complicated things like &quot;most riders are relatively price sensitive and so this doesn&apos;t matter.&quot; And plausibly they&apos;re completely right.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>That&apos;s what I was going to say.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>But the thing which feels important to me is something like a lot of the time it&apos;s not worth solving the alignment problems at any given moment because something else is a bigger problem to how things are going locally. And this can continue being the case for a long time, and then you end up with everyone being locked in to this system where they never solved the alignment problems. And it&apos;s really hard to make people understand this, and then you get locked into this bad world.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>So if I were to try and put that in the context of AI alignment, I think this is a legitimate reason for being more pessimistic. And the way that I would make that argument is: it sure seems like we are going to decide on what method or path we&apos;re going to use to build AGI. Maybe we&apos;ll do a bunch of research and decide we&apos;re just going to scale up language models or something like this. I don&apos;t know. And we will do that before we have any idea of which technique would be easiest to align and as a result, we will be forced to try to align this exogenously chosen AGI technique and that would be harder than if we got to design our alignment techniques and our AGI techniques simultaneously.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>I&apos;m imagining some pretty slow take off here, and I don&apos;t imagine this as ever having a phase where we built this AGI and now we need to align it. It&apos;s more like we&apos;re continuously building and deploying these systems that are gradually more and more powerful, and every time we want to deploy a system, it has to be doing something which is useful to someone. And many of the things which are useful, require things that are kind of like alignment. &quot;I want to make a lot of money from my system that will give advice,&quot; and if it wants to give good generalist advice over email, it&apos;s going to need to have at least some implicit understanding of human preferences. Maybe we just use giant language models and everything&apos;s just totally fine here. A really good language model isn&apos;t able to give arbitrarily good aligned advice, but you can get advice that sounds really good from a language model, and I&apos;m worried that the default path is going to involve the most popular AI advice services being kind of misaligned, and just never bothering to fix that. Does that make any more sense?</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>Yeah, I think I totally buy that that will happen. But I think I&apos;m more like as you get to AI systems doing more and more important things in the world, it becomes more and more important that they are really truly aligned and investment in alignment increases correspondingly.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>What&apos;s the mechanism by which people realize that they need to put more work into alignment here?</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>I think there&apos;s multiple. One is I expect that people are aware, like even in the Uber case, I expect people are aware of the misalignment that exists, but decide that it&apos;s not worth their time to fix it. So the continuation of that, people will be aware of it and then they will decide that they should fix it.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>If I&apos;m trying to sell to city governments this language model based system which will give them advice on city planning, it&apos;s not clear to me that at any point the city governments are going to start demanding better alignment features. Maybe that&apos;s the way that it goes but it doesn&apos;t seem obvious that city governments would think to ask that, and --</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>I wasn&apos;t imagining this from the user side. I was imagining this from the engineers or designers side.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>Yeah.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>I think from the user side I would speak more to warning shots. You know, you have your cashier AI system or your waiter AIs and they were optimizing for tips more so than actually collecting money and so they like offer free meals in order to get more tips. At some point one of these AI systems passes all of the internal checks and makes it out into the world and only then does the problem arise and everyone&apos;s like, &quot;Oh my God, this is terrible. What the hell are you doing? Make this better.&quot;</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>There&apos;s two mechanisms via which that alignment might be okay. One of them is that researchers might realize that they want to put more effort into alignment and then solve these problems. The other mechanism is that users might demand better alignment because of warning shots. I think that I don&apos;t buy that either of these is sufficient. I don&apos;t buy that it&apos;s sufficient for researchers to decide to do it because in a competitive world, the researchers who realize this is important, if they try to only make aligned products, they are not going to be able to sell them because their products will be much less good than the unaligned ones. So you have to argue that there is demand for the things which are actually aligned well. But for this to work, your users have to be able to distinguish between things that have good alignment properties and those which don&apos;t, and this seems really hard for users to do. And I guess, when I try to imagine analogies, I just don&apos;t see many examples of people successfully solving problems like this, like businesses making products that are different levels of dangerousness, and then users successfully buying the safe ones.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>I think usually what happens is you get regulation that forces everyone to be safe. I don&apos;t know if it was regulation, but like airplanes are incredibly safe. Cars are incredibly safe.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>Yeah but in this case what would happen is doing the unsafe thing allows you to make enormous amounts of money, and so the countries which don&apos;t put in the regulations are going to be massively advantaged compared to ones which don&apos;t.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>Why doesn&apos;t that apply for cars and airplanes?</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>So to start with, cars in poor countries are a lot less safe. Another thing is that a lot of the effort in making safer cars and airplanes comes from designing them. Once you&apos;ve done the work of designing it, it&apos;s that much more expensive to put your formally-verified 747 software into more planes, and because of weird features of the fact that there are only like two big plane manufacturers, everyone gets the safer planes.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry: </strong>So tying this into robustness. The fundamental concern here is about the incentives to make aligned systems that are safety and alignment robust in the real world.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>I think that&apos;s basically right. I sort of see these incentives as existing and the world generally being reasonably good at dealing with high stakes problems.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>What&apos;s an example of the world being good at dealing with a high stakes problem?</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>I feel like biotech seems reasonably well handled, relatively speaking,</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>Like bio-security?</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>Yeah.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>Okay, if the world handles AI as well as bio-security, there&apos;s no way we&apos;re okay.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>Really? I&apos;m aware of ways in which we&apos;re not doing bio-security well, but there seem to be ways in which we&apos;re doing it well too.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>The nice thing about bio-security is that very few people are incentivized to kill everyone, and this means that it&apos;s okay if you&apos;re sloppier about your regulations, but my understanding is that lots of regulations are pretty weak.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>I guess I was more imagining the research community&apos;s coordination on this. Surprisingly good.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>I wouldn&#x2019;t describe it that way.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>It seems like the vast majority of the research community is onboard with the right thing and like 1% isn&#x2019;t. Yeah. Plausibly we need to have regulations for that last 1%.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>I think that 99% of the synthetic biology research community is on board with &quot;it would be bad if everyone died.&quot; I think that some very small proportion is onboard with things like &quot;we shouldn&apos;t do research if it&apos;s very dangerous and will make the world a lot worse.&quot; I would say like way less than half of synthetic biologists seem to agree with statements like &quot;it&apos;s bad to do really dangerous research.&quot; Or like, &quot;when you&apos;re considering doing research, you consider differential technological development.&quot; I think this is just not a thing biologists think about, from my experience talking to biologists.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>I&apos;d be interested in betting with you on this afterwards.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>Me too.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry: </strong>So it seems like it&apos;s going to be difficult to come down to a concrete understanding or agreement here on the incentive structures in the world and whether they lead to the proliferation of unaligned AI systems or semi aligned AI systems versus fully aligned AI systems and whether that poses a kind of lock-in, right? Would you say that that fairly summarizes your concern Buck?</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>Yeah. I expect that Rohin and I agree mostly on the size of the coordination problem required, or the costs that would be required by trying to do things the safer way. And I think Rohin is just a lot more optimistic about those costs being paid.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>I think I&apos;m optimistic both about people&apos;s ability to coordinate paying those costs and about incentives pointing towards paying those costs.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>I think that Rohin is right that I disagree with him about the second of those as well.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry: </strong>Are you interested in unpacking this anymore? Are you happy to move on?</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>I actually do want to talk about this for two more minutes. I am really surprised by the claim that humans have solved coordination problems as hard as this one. I think the example you gave is humans doing radically nowhere near well enough. What are examples of coordination problem type things... There was a bunch of stuff with nuclear weapons, where I feel like humans did badly enough that we definitely wouldn&apos;t have been okay in an AI situation. There are a bunch of examples of the US secretly threatening people with nuclear strikes, which I think is an example of some kind of coordination failure. I don&apos;t think that the world has successfully coordinated on never threaten first nuclear strikes. If we had successfully coordinated on that, I would consider nuclear weapons to be less of a failure, but as it is the US has actually according to Daniel Ellsberg threatened a bunch of people with first strikes.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>Yeah, I think I update less on specific scenarios and update quite a lot more on, &quot;it just never happened.&quot; The sheer amount of coincidence that would be required given the level of, Oh my God, there were close calls multiple times a year for many decades. That seems just totally implausible and it just means that our understanding of what&apos;s happening is wrong.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>Again, also the thing I&apos;m imagining is this very gradual takeoff world where people, every year, they release their new most powerful AI systems. And if, in a particular year, AI Corp decided to not release its thing, then AI Corps two and three and four would rise to being one, two and three in total profits instead of two, three and four. In that kind of a world, I feel a lot more pessimistic.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>I&apos;m definitely imagining more of the case where they coordinate to all not do things. Either by international regulation or via the companies themselves coordinating amongst each other. Even without that, it&apos;s plausible that AI Corp one does this. One example I&apos;d give is, Waymo has just been very slow to deploy self driving cars relative to all the other self driving car companies, and my impression is that this is mostly because of safety concerns.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>Interesting and slightly persuasive example. I would love to talk through this more at some point. I think this is really important and I think I haven&apos;t heard a really good conversation about this.</p><p>Apologies for describing what I think is going wrong inside your mind or something, which is generally a bad way of saying things, but it sounds kind of to me like you&apos;re implicitly assuming more concentrated advantage and fewer actors than I think actually are implied by gradual takeoff scenarios.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>I&apos;m usually imagining something like a 100+ companies trying to build the next best AI system, and 10 or 20 of them being clear front runners or something.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>That makes sense. I guess I don&apos;t quite see how the coordination successes you were describing arise in that kind of a world. But I am happy to move on.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry: </strong>So before we move on on this point, is there anything which you would suggest as obvious solutions, should Buck&apos;s model of the risks here be the case. So it seemed like it would demand more centralized institutions which would help to mitigate some of the lock in here.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>Yeah. So there&apos;s a lot of work in policy and governance about this. Not much of which is public unfortunately. But I think the thing to say is that people are thinking about it and it does sort of look like trying to figure out how to get the world to actually coordinate on things. But as Buck has pointed out, we have tried to do this before and so there&apos;s probably a lot to learn from past cases as well. But I am not an expert on this and don&apos;t really want to talk as though I were one.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry: </strong>All right. So there&apos;s lots of governance and coordination thought that kind of needs to go into solving many of these coordination issues around developing beneficial AI. So I think with that we can move along now to scaling to superhuman abilities. So Rohin, what do you have to say about this topic area?</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>I think this is in some sense related to what we were talking about before, you can predict what a human would say, but it&apos;s hard to back out true underlying values beneath them. Here the problem is, suppose you are learning from some sort of human feedback about what you&apos;re supposed to be doing, the information contained in that tells you how to do whatever the human can do. It doesn&apos;t really tell you how to exceed what the human can do without having some additional assumptions.</p><p>Now, depending on how the human feedback is structured, this might lead to different things like if the human is demonstrating how to do the task to you, then this would suggest that it would be hard to do the task any better than the human can, but if the human was evaluating how well you did the task, then you can do the task better in a way that the human wouldn&apos;t be able to tell was better. Ideally, at some point we would like to have AI systems that can actually do just really powerful, great things, that we are unable to understand all the details of and so we would neither be able to demonstrate or evaluate them.</p><p>How do we get to those sorts of AI systems? The main proposals in this bucket are iterated amplification, debate, and recursive reward modeling. So in iterated amplification, we started with an initial policy, and we alternate between amplification and distillation, which increases capabilities and efficiency respectively. This can encode a bunch of different algorithms, but usually amplification is done by decomposing questions into easier sub questions, and then using the agent to answer those sub questions. While distillation can be done using supervised learning or reinforcement learning, so you get these answers that are created by these amplified systems that take a long time to run, and you just train a neural net to very quickly predict the answers without having to do this whole big decomposition thing. In debate, we train an agent through self play in a zero sum game where the agent&apos;s goal is to win a question answering debate as evaluated by a human judge. The hope here is that since both sides of the debate can point out flaws in the other side&apos;s arguments -- they&apos;re both very powerful AI systems -- such a set up can use a human judge to train far more capable agents while still incentivizing the agents to provide honest true information. With recursive reward modeling, you can think of it as an instantiation of the general alternate between amplification and distillation framework, but it works sort of bottom up instead of top down. So you&apos;ll start by building AI systems that can help you evaluate simple, easy tasks. Then use those AI systems to help you evaluate more complex tasks and you keep iterating this process until eventually you have AI systems that help you with very complex tasks like how to design the city. And this lets you then train an AI agent that can design the city effectively even though you don&apos;t totally understand why it&apos;s doing the things it&apos;s doing or why they&apos;re even good.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> Do either of you guys have any high level thoughts on any of these approaches to scaling to superhuman abilities?</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris:</strong> I have some.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry: </strong>Go for it.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>So to start with, I think it&apos;s worth noting that another approach would be ambitious value learning, in the sense that I would phrase these not as approaches for scaling to superhuman abilities, but they&apos;re like approaches for scaling to superhuman abilities while only doing tasks that relate to the actual behavior of humans rather than trying to back out their values explicitly. Does that match your thing Rohin?</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>Yeah, I agree. I often phrase that as with ambitious value learning, there&apos;s not a clear ground truth to be focusing on, whereas with all three of these methods, the ground truth is what a human would do if they got a very, very long time to think or at least that is what they&apos;re trying to approximate. It&apos;s a little tricky to see why exactly they&apos;re approximating that, but there are some good posts about this. The key difference between these techniques and ambitious value learning is that there is in some sense a ground truth that you are trying to approximate.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>I think these are all kind of exciting ideas. I think they&apos;re all kind of better ideas than I expected to exist for this problem a few years ago. Which probably means we should update against my ability to correctly judge how hard AI safety problems are, which is great news, in as much as I think that a lot of these problems are really hard. Nevertheless, I don&apos;t feel super optimistic that any of them are actually going to work. One thing which isn&apos;t in the elevator pitch for IDA, which is iterated distillation and amplification (and debate), is that you get to hire the humans who are going to be providing the feedback, or the humans whose answers AI systems are going to be trained with. And this is actually really great. Because for instance, you could have this program where you hire a bunch of people and you put them through your one month long training an AGI course. And then you only take the top 50% of them. I feel a lot more optimistic about these proposals given you&apos;re allowed to think really hard about how to set it up such that the humans have the easiest time possible. And this is one reason why I&apos;m optimistic about people doing research in factored cognition and stuff, which I&apos;m sure Rohin&apos;s going to explain in a bit.</p><p>One comment about recursive reward modeling: it seems like it has a lot of things in common with IDA. The main downside that it seems to have to me is that the human is in charge of figuring out how to decompose the task into evaluations at a variety of levels. Whereas with IDA, your system itself is able to naturally decompose the task into a variety levels, and for this reason I feel a bit more optimistic about IDA.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>With recursive reward modeling, one agent that you can train is just an agent that&apos;s good at doing decompositions. That is a thing you can do with it. It&apos;s a thing that the people at DeepMind are thinking about.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>Yep, that&#x2019;s a really good point.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>I also strongly like the fact that you can train your humans to be good at providing feedback. This is also true about specification learning. It&apos;s less clear if it&apos;s true about ambitious value learning. No one&apos;s really proposed how you could do ambitious value learning really. Maybe arguably Stuart Russell&apos;s book is kind of a proposal, but it doesn&apos;t have that many details.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>And, for example, it doesn&apos;t address any of my concerns in ways that I find persuasive.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>Right. But for specification learning also you definitely want to train the humans who are going to be providing feedback to the AI system. That is an important part of why you should expect this to work.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>I often give talks where I try to give an introduction to IDA and debate as a proposal for AI alignment. I&apos;m giving these talks to people with computer science backgrounds, and they&#x2019;re almost always incredibly skeptical that it&apos;s actually possible to decompose thought in this kind of a way. And with debate, they&apos;re very skeptical that truth wins, or that the nash equilibrium is accuracy. For this reason I&apos;m super enthusiastic about research into the factored cognition hypothesis of the type that Ought is doing some of.</p><p>I&apos;m kind of interested in your overall take for how likely it is that the factored cognition hypothesis holds and that it&apos;s actually possible to do any of this stuff, Rohin. You could also explain what that is.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>I&apos;ll do that. So basically with both iterated amplification, debate, or recursive reward modeling, they all hinge on this idea of being able to decompose questions, maybe it&apos;s not so obvious why that&apos;s true for debate, but it&apos;s true. Go listen to the podcast about debate if you want to get more details on that.</p><p>So this hypothesis is basically for any tasks that we care about, it is possible to decompose this into a bunch of sub tasks that are all easier to do. Such that if you&apos;re able to do the sub tasks, then you can do the overall top level tasks and in particular you can iterate this down, building a tree of smaller and smaller tasks until you can get to the level of tasks that a human could do in a day. Or if you&apos;re trying to do it very far, maybe tasks that a human can do in a couple of minutes. Whether or not you can actually decompose the task &quot;be an effective CEO&quot; into a bunch of sub tasks that eventually bottom out into things humans can do in a few minutes is totally unclear. Some people are optimistic, some people are pessimistic. It&apos;s called the factored cognition hypothesis and Ought is an organization that&apos;s studying it.</p><p>It sounds very controversial at first and I, like many other people had the intuitive reaction of, &apos;Oh my God, this is never going to work and it&apos;s not true&apos;. I think the thing that actually makes me optimistic about it is you don&apos;t have to do what you might call a direct decomposition. You can do things like if your task is to be an effective CEO, your first sub question could be, what are the important things to think about when being a CEO or something like this, as opposed to usually when I think of decompositions I would think of, first I need to deal with hiring. Maybe I need to understand HR, maybe I need to understand all of the metrics that the company is optimizing. Very object level concerns, but the decompositions are totally allowed to also be meta level where you&apos;ll spin off a bunch of computation that is just trying to answer the meta level of question of how should I best think about this question at all.</p><p>Another important reason for optimism is that based on the structure of iterated amplification, debate and recursive reward modeling, this tree can be gigantic. It can be exponentially large. Something that we couldn&apos;t run even if we had all of the humans on Earth collaborating to do this. That&apos;s okay. Given how the training process is structured, considering the fact that you can do the equivalent of millennia of person years of effort in this decomposed tree, I think that also gives me more of a, &apos;okay, maybe this is possible&apos; and that&apos;s also why you&apos;re able to do all of this meta level thinking because you have a computational budget for it. When you take all of those together, I sort of come up with &#x201C;seems possible. I don&apos;t really know.&#x201D;</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>I think I&apos;m currently at 30-to-50% on the factored cognition thing basically working out. Which isn&apos;t nothing.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>Yeah, that seems like a perfectly reasonable thing. I think I could imagine putting a day of thought into it and coming up with numbers anywhere between 20 and 80.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>For what it&apos;s worth, in conversation at some point in the last few years, Paul Christiano gave numbers that were not wildly more optimistic than me. I don&apos;t think that the people who are working on this think it&apos;s obviously fine. And it would be great if this stuff works, so I&apos;m really in favor of people looking into it.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>Yeah, I should mention another key intuition against it. We have all these examples of human geniuses like Ramanujan, who were posed very difficult math problems and just immediately get the answer and then you ask them how did they do it and they say, well, I asked myself what should the answer be? And I was like, the answer should be a continued fraction. And then I asked myself which continued fraction and then I got the answer. And you&apos;re like, that does not sound very decomposable. It seems like you need these magic flashes of intuition. Those would be the hard cases for factored cognition. It still seems possible that you could do it by both this exponential try a bunch of possibilities and also by being able to discover intuitions that work in practice and just believing them because they work in practice and then applying them to the problem at hand. You could imagine that with enough computation you&apos;d be able to discover such intuitions.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>You can&apos;t answer a math problem by searching exponentially much through the search tree. The only exponential power you get from IDA is IDA is letting you specify the output of your cognitive process in such a way that&apos;s going to match some exponentially sized human process. As long as that exponentially sized human process was only exponentially sized because it&apos;s really inefficient, but is kind of fundamentally not an exponentially sized problem, then your machine learning should be able to speed it up a bunch. But the thing where you search over search strategy is not valid. If that&apos;s all you can do, that&apos;s not good enough.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>Searching over search strategies, I agree you can&apos;t do, but if you have an exponential search that could be implemented by humans. We know by hypothesis, if you can solve it with a flash of intuition, there is in fact some more efficient way to do it and so whether or not the distillation steps will actually be enough to get to the point where you can do those flashes of intuition. That&apos;s an open question.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>This is one of my favorite areas of AI safety research and I would love for there to be more of it. Something I have been floating for a little while is I kind of wish that there was another Ought. It just seems like it would be so good if we had definitive information about the factored cognition hypothesis. And it also it seems like the kind of thing which is potentially parallelizable. And I feel like I know a lot of people who love talking about how thinking works. A lot of rationalists are really into this. I would just be super excited for some of them to form teams of four and go off on their own and build an Ought competitor. I feel like this is the kind of thing where plausibly, a bunch of enthusiastic people could make progress on their own.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>Yeah, I agree with that. Definitely seems like one of the higher value things but I might be more excited about universality.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry: </strong>All right, well let&apos;s get started with universality then. What is universality and why are you optimistic about it?</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>So universality is hard to explain well, in a single sentence. For whatever supervisor is training our agent, you want that supervisor to &#x201C;know everything the agent knows.&#x201D; In particular if the agent comes up with some deceptive strategy to look like it&apos;s achieving the goal, but actually it hasn&apos;t. The supervisors should know that it was doing this deceptive strategy for the reason of trying to trick the supervisor and so the supervisor can then penalize it. The classic example of why this is important and hard also due to Paul Christiano is plagiarism. Suppose you are training on the AI system to produce novel works of literature and as part of its training data, the AI system gets to read this library of a million books.</p><p>It&apos;s possible that this AI system decides, Hey, you know the best way I can make a great novel seeming book is to just take these five books and take out plot points, passages from each of them and put them together and then this new book will look totally novel and will be very good because I used all of the best Shakespearean writing or whatever. If your supervisor doesn&apos;t know that the agent has done this, the only way the supervisor can really check is to go read the entire million books. Even if the agent only read 10 books and so then the supervision becomes a way more costly than running the agent, which is not a great state to be in, and so what you really want is that if the agent does this, the supervisor is able to say, I see that you just copied this stuff over from these other books in order to trick me into thinking that you had written something novel that was good.</p><p>That&apos;s bad. I&apos;m penalizing you. Stop doing that in the future. Now, this sort of property, I mean it&apos;s very nice in the abstract, but who knows whether or not we can actually build it in practice. There&apos;s some reason for optimism that I don&apos;t think I can adequately convey, but I wrote a newsletter summarizing some of it sometime ago, but again, reading through the posts I became more optimistic that it was an achievable property, than when I first heard what the property was. The reason I&apos;m optimistic about it is that it just sort of seems to capture the thing that we actually care about. It&apos;s not everything, like it doesn&apos;t solve the robustness problem. Universality only tells you what the agent&apos;s currently doing. You know all the facts about that. Whereas for robustness you want to say even in these hypothetical situations that the agent hasn&apos;t encountered yet and doesn&apos;t know stuff about, even when it encounters those situations, it&apos;s going to stay aligned with you so universality doesn&apos;t get you all the way there, but it definitely feels like it&apos;s getting you quite a bit.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>That&apos;s really interesting to hear you phrase it that way. I guess I would have thought of universality as a subset of robustness. I&apos;m curious what you think of that first.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>I definitely think you could use universality to achieve a subset of robustness. Maybe I would say universality is a subset of interpretability.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>Yeah, and I care about interpretability as a subset of robustness basically, or as a subset of inner alignment, which is pretty close to robustness in my mind. The other thing I would say is you were saying there that one difference between universality and robustness is that universality only tells you why the agent did the thing it currently did, and this doesn&apos;t suffice to tell us about the situations that the agent isn&apos;t currently in. One really nice thing though is that if the agent is only acting a particular way because it wants you to trust it, that&apos;s a fact about its current behavior that you will know, and so if you have the universality property, your overseer just knows your agent is trying to deceive it. Which seems like it would be incredibly great and would resolve like half of my problem with safety if you had it.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>Yeah, that seems right. The case that universality doesn&apos;t cover is when your AI system is initially not deceptive, but then at some point in the future it&apos;s like, &apos;Oh my God, now it&apos;s possible to go and build Dyson spheres or something, but wait, in this situation probably I should be doing this other thing and humans won&apos;t like that. Now I better deceive humans&apos;. The transition into deception would have to be a surprise in some sense even to the AI system.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>Yeah, I guess I&apos;m just not worried about that. Suppose I have this system which is as smart as a reasonably smart human or 10 reasonably smart humans, but it&apos;s not as smart as the whole world. If I can just ask it what its best sense about how aligned it is, is? And if I can trust its answer? I don&apos;t know man, I&apos;m pretty okay with systems that think they&apos;re aligned, answering that question honestly.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>I think I somewhat agree. I like this reversal where I&apos;m the pessimistic one.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>Yeah me too. I&apos;m like, &quot;look, system, I want you to think as hard as you can to come up with the best arguments you can come up with for why you are misaligned, and the problems with you.&quot; And if I just actually trust the system to get this right, then the bad outcomes I get here are just pure accidents. I just had this terrible initialization of my neural net parameters, such that I had this system that honestly believed that it was going to be aligned. And then as it got trained more, this suddenly changed and I couldn&apos;t do anything about it. I don&apos;t quite see the story for how this goes super wrong. It seems a lot less bad than the default situation.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>Yeah. I think the story I would tell is something like, well, if you look at humans, they&apos;re pretty wrong about what their preferences will be in the future. For example, there&apos;s this trope of how teenagers fall in love and then fall out of love, but when they&apos;re in love, they swear undying oaths to each other or something. To the extent that is true, that seems like the sort of failure that could lead to x-risk if it also happened with AI systems.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>I feel pretty optimistic about all the garden-variety approaches to solving this. Teenagers were not selected very hard on accuracy of their undying oaths. And if you instead had accuracy of self-model as a key feature you were selecting for in your AI system, plausibly you&apos;ll just be way more okay.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>Yeah. Maybe people could coordinate well on this. I feel less good about people coordinating on this sort of problem.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>For what it&apos;s worth, I think there are coordination problems here and I feel like my previous argument about why coordination is hard and won&apos;t happen by default also probably applies to us not being okay. I&apos;m not sure how this all plays out. I&apos;d have to think about it more.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>Yeah. I think it&apos;s more like this is a subtle and non-obvious problem, which by hypothesis doesn&apos;t happen in the systems you actually have and only happens later and those are the sorts of problems I&apos;m like, Ooh, not sure if we can deal with those ones, but I agree that there&apos;s a good chance that there&apos;s just not a problem at all in the world where we already have universality and checked all the obvious stuff.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>Yeah. I would like to say universality is one of my other favorite areas of AI alignment research, in terms of how happy I&apos;d be if it worked out really well.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry: </strong>All right, so let&apos;s see if we can slightly pick up the pace here. Moving forward and starting with interpretability.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>Yeah, so I mean I think we&apos;ve basically discussed interpretability already. Universality is a specific kind of interpretability, but the case for interpretability is just like, sure seems like it would be good if you could understand what your AI systems are doing. You could then notice when they&apos;re not aligned, and fix that somehow. It&apos;s a pretty clear cut case for a thing that would be good if we achieved it and it&apos;s still pretty uncertain how likely we are to be able to achieve it.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry: </strong>All right, so let&apos;s keep it moving and let&apos;s hit impact regularization now.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>Yeah, impact regularization in particular is one of the ideas that are not trying to align the AI system but are instead trying to say, well, whatever AI system we build, let&apos;s make sure it doesn&apos;t cause a catastrophe. It doesn&apos;t lead to extinction or existential risk. What it hopes to do is say, all right, AI system, do whatever it is you wanted to do. I don&apos;t care about that. Just make sure that you don&apos;t have a huge impact upon the world.</p><p>Whatever you do, keep your impact not too high. And so there&apos;s been a lot of work on this in recent years there&apos;s been relative reachability, attainable utility preservation, and I think in general the sense is like, wow, it&apos;s gone quite a bit further than people expected it to go. I think it definitely does prevent you from doing very, very powerful things of the sort, like if you wanted to stop all competing AI projects from ever being able to build AGI, that doesn&apos;t seem like the sort of thing you can do with an impact regularized AI system, but it sort of seems plausible that you could prevent convergent instrumental sub goals using impact regularization. Where AI systems that are trying to steal resources and power from humans, you could imagine that you&apos;d say, hey, don&apos;t do that level of impact, you can still have the level of impact of say running a company or something like that.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>My take on all this is that I&apos;m pretty pessimistic about all of it working. I think that impact regularization or whatever is a non-optimal point on the capabilities / alignment trade off or something, in terms of safety you&apos;re getting for how much capability you&apos;re sacrificing. My basic a problem here is basically analogous to my problem with value learning, where I think we&apos;re trying to take these extremely essentially fuzzy concepts and then factor our agent through these fuzzy concepts like impact, and basically the thing that I imagine happening is any impact regularization strategy you try to employ, if your AI is usable, will end up not helping with its alignment. For any definition of impacts you come up with, it&apos;ll end up doing something which gets around that. Or it&apos;ll make your AI system completely useless, is my basic guess as to what happens.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>Yeah, so I think again in this setting, if you formalize it and then say, consider the optimal agent. Yeah, that can totally get around your impact penalty, but in practice it sure seems like, what you want to do is say this convergent instrumental subgoal stuff, don&apos;t do any of that. Continue to do things that are normal in regular life. And those seem like pretty distinct categories. Such that I would not be shocked if we could actually distinguish between the two.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>It sounds like the main benefit you&apos;re going for is trying to make your AI system not do insane, convergent, instrumental sub-goal style stuff. So another approach I can imagine taking here would be some kind of value learning or something, where you&apos;re asking humans for feedback on whether plans are insanely convergent, instrumental sub-goal style, and just not doing the things which, when humans are asked to rate how sketchy the plans are the humans rate as sufficiently sketchy? That seems like about as good a plan. I&apos;m curious what you think.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>The idea of power as your attainable utility across a wide variety of utility functions seems like a pretty good formalization to me. I think in the worlds where I actually buy a formalization, I tend to expect the formalization to work better. I do think the formalization is not perfect. Most notably with the current formalization of power, your power never changes if you have extremely good beliefs. Your notion, you&apos;re just like, I always have the same power because I&apos;m always able to do the same things and you never get surprised, so maybe I agree with you because I think the current formalization is not good enough. Yeah, I think I agree with you but I could see it going either way.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>I could be totally wrong about this, and correct me if I&apos;m wrong, my sense is that you have to be able to back out the agent&apos;s utility function or its models of the world. Which seems like it&apos;s assuming a particular path for AI development which doesn&apos;t seem to me particularly likely.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>I definitely agree with that for all the current methods too.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>So it&apos;s like: assume that we have already perfectly solved our problems with universality and robustness and transparency and whatever else. I feel like you kind of have to have solved all of those problems before you can do this, and then you don&apos;t need it or something.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>I don&apos;t think I agree with that. I definitely agree that the current algorithms that people have written assume that you can just make a change to the AI&apos;s utility function. I don&apos;t think that&apos;s what even their proponents would suggest as the actual plan.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>What is the actual plan?</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>I don&apos;t actually know what their actual plan would be, but one plan I could imagine is figure out what exactly the conceptual things we have to do with impact measurement are, and then whatever method we have for building AGI, probably there&apos;s going to be some part which is specify the goal and then in the specify goal part, instead of just saying pursue X, we want to say pursue X without changing your ability to pursue Y, and Z and W, and P, and Q.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>I think that that does not sound like a good plan. I don&apos;t think that we should expect our AI systems to be structured that way in the future.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>Plausibly we have to do this with natural language or something.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>It seems very likely to me that the thing you do is reinforcement learning where at the start of the episode you get a sentence of English which is telling you what your goal is and then blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and this seems like a pretty reasonable strategy for making powerful and sort of aligned AI. Aligned enough to be usable for things that aren&apos;t very hard. But you just fundamentally don&apos;t have access to the internal representations that the AI is using for its sense of what belief is, and stuff like that. And that seems like a really big problem.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>I definitely see this as more of an outer alignment thing, or like an easier to specify outer alignment type thing than say, IDA is that type stuff.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>Okay, I guess that makes sense. So we&apos;re just like assuming we&apos;ve solved all the inner alignment problems?</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>In the story so far yeah, I think all of the researchers who actually work on this haven&apos;t thought much about inner alignment.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>My overall summary is that I really don&apos;t like this plan. I feel like it&apos;s not robust to scale. As you were saying Rohin, if your system gets more and more accurate beliefs, stuff breaks. It just feels like the kind of thing that doesn&apos;t work.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>I mean, it&apos;s definitely not conceptually neat and elegant in the sense of it&apos;s not attacking the underlying problem. And in a problem setting where you expect adversarial optimization type dynamics, conceptual elegance actually does count for quite a lot in whether or not you believe your solution will work.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>I feel it&#x2019;s like trying to add edge detectors to your image classifiers to make them more adversarily robust or something, which is backwards.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>Yeah, I think I agree with that general perspective. I don&apos;t actually know if I&apos;m more optimistic than you. Maybe I just don&apos;t say... Maybe we&apos;d have the same uncertainty distributions and you just say yours more strongly or something.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry: </strong>All right, so then let&apos;s just move a little quickly through the next three, which are causal modeling, oracles, and decision theory.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>Yeah, I mean, well decision theory, MIRI did some work on it. I am not the person to ask about it, so I&apos;m going to skip that one. Even if you look at the long version, I&apos;m just like, here are some posts. Good luck. So causal modeling, I don&apos;t fully understand what the overall story is here but the actual work that&apos;s been published is basically what we can do is we can take potential plans or training processes for AI systems. We can write down causal models that tell us how the various pieces of the training system interact with each other and then using algorithms developed for causal models we can tell when an AI system would have an incentive to either observe or intervene on an underlying variable.</p><p>One thing that came out of this was that you can build a model-based reinforcement learner that doesn&apos;t have any incentive to wire head as long as when it makes its plans, the plans are evaluated by the current reward function as opposed to whatever future reward function it would have. And that was explained using this framework of causal modeling. Oracles, Oracles are basically the idea that we can just train an AI system to just answer questions, give it a question and it tries to figure out the best answer it can to that question, prioritizing accuracy.</p><p>One worry that people have recently been talking about is the predictions that the Oracle makes then affect the world, which can affect whether or not the prediction was correct. Like maybe if I predict that I will go to bed at 11 then I&apos;m more likely to actually go to bed at 11 because I want my prediction to come true or something and so then the Oracles can still &#x201C;choose&#x201D; between different self confirming predictions and so that gives them a source of agency and one way that people want to avoid this is using what are called counter-factual Oracles where you set up the training, such that the Oracles are basically making predictions under the assumption that their predictions are not going to influence the future.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry: </strong>Yeah, okay. Oracles seem like they just won&apos;t happen. There&apos;ll be incentives to make things other than Oracles and that Oracles would even be able to exert influence upon the world in other ways.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>Yeah, I think I agree that Oracles do not seem very competitive.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry: </strong>Let&apos;s do forecasting now then.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>So the main sub things within forecasting one, there&apos;s just been a lot of work recently on actually building good forecasting technology. There has been an AI specific version of Metaculus that&apos;s been going on for a while now. There&apos;s been some work at the Future of Humanity Institute on building better tools for working with probability distributions under recording and evaluating forecasts. There was an AI resolution council where basically now you can make forecasts about what this particular group of people will think in five years or something like that, which is much easier to operationalize than most other kinds of forecasts. So this helps with constructing good questions. On the actual object level, I think there are two main things. One is that it became increasingly more obvious in the past two years that AI progress currently is being driven by larger and larger amounts of compute.</p><p>It totally could be driven by other things as well, but at the very least, compute is a pretty important factor. And then takeoff speeds. So there&apos;s been this long debate in the AI safety community over whether -- to take the extremes, whether or not we should expect that AI capabilities will see a very sharp spike. So initially, your AI capabilities are improving by like one unit a year, maybe then with some improvements it got to two units a year and then for whatever reason, suddenly they&apos;re now at 20 units a year or a hundred units a year and they just swoop way past what you would get by extrapolating past trends, and so that&apos;s what we might call a discontinuous takeoff. If you predict that that won&apos;t happen instead you&apos;ll get AI that&apos;s initially improving at one unit per year. Then maybe two units per year, maybe three units per year. Then five units per year, and the rate of progress continually increases. The world&apos;s still gets very, very crazy, but in a sort of gradual, continuous way that would be called a continuous takeoff.</p><p>Basically there were two posts that argued pretty forcefully for continuous takeoff back in, I want to say February of 2018, and this at least made me believe that continuous takeoff was more likely. Sadly, we just haven&apos;t actually seen much defense of the other side of the view since then. Even though we do know that there definitely are people who still believe the other side, that there will be a discontinuous takeoff.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry: </strong>Yeah so what are both you guys&apos; views on them?</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>Here are a couple of things. One is that I really love the operationalization of slow take off or continuous take off that Paul provided in his post, which was one of the ones Rohin was referring to from February 2018. He says, &#x201C;by slow takeoff, I mean that there is a four year doubling of the economy before there is a one year doubling of the economy.&#x201D; As in, there&apos;s a period of four years over which world GDP increases by a factor four, after which there is a period of one year. As opposed to a situation where the first one-year doubling happens out of nowhere. Currently, doubling times for the economy are on the order of like 20 years, and so a one year doubling would be a really big deal. The way that I would phrase why we care about this, is because worlds where we have widespread, human level AI feel like they have incredibly fast economic growth. And if it&apos;s true that we expect AI progress to increase gradually and continuously, then one important consequence of this is that by the time we have human level AI systems, the world is already totally insane. A four year doubling would just be crazy. That would be economic growth drastically higher than economic growth currently is.</p><p>This means it would be obvious to everyone who&apos;s paying attention that something is up and the world is radically changing in a rapid fashion. Another way I&apos;ve been thinking about this recently is people talk about transformative AI, by which they mean AI which would have at least as much of an impact on the world as the industrial revolution had. And it seems plausible to me that octopus level AI would be transformative. Like suppose that AI could just never get better than octopus brains. This would be way smaller of a deal than I expect AI to actually be, but it would still be a massive deal, and would still possibly lead to a change in the world that I would call transformative. And if you think this is true, and if you think that we&apos;re going to have octopus level AI before we have human level AI, then you should expect that radical changes that you might call transformative have happened by the time that we get to the AI alignment problems that we&apos;ve been worrying about. And if so, this is really big news.</p><p>When I was reading about this stuff when I was 18, I was casually imagining that the alignment problem is a thing that some people have to solve while they&apos;re building an AGI in their lab while the rest of the world&apos;s ignoring them. But if the thing which is actually happening is the world is going insane around everyone, that&apos;s a really important difference.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>I would say that this is probably the most important contested question in AI alignment right now. Some consequences of it are in a gradual or continuous takeoff world you expect that by the time we get to systems that can pose an existential risk. You&apos;ve already had pretty smart systems that have been deployed in the real world. They probably had some failure modes. Whether or not we call them alignment failure modes or not is maybe not that important. The point is people will be aware that AI systems can fail in weird ways, depending on what sorts of failures you expect, you might expect this to lead to more coordination, more involvement in safety work. You might also be more optimistic about using testing and engineering styles of approaches to the problem which rely a bit more on trial and error type of reasoning because you actually will get a chance to see errors before they happen at a super intelligent existential risk causing mode. There are lots of implications of this form that pretty radically change which alignment plans you think are feasible.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>Also, it&apos;s pretty radically changed how optimistic you are about this whole AI alignment situation, at the very least, people who are very optimistic about AI alignment causing relatively small amounts of existential risk. A lot of the reason for this seems to be that they think that we&apos;re going to get these warning shots where before we have superintelligent AI, we have sub-human level intelligent AI with alignment failures like the cashier Rohin was talking about earlier. And then people start caring about AI alignment a lot more. So optimism is also greatly affected by what you think about this.</p><p>I&apos;ve actually been wanting to argue with people about this recently. I wrote a doc last night where I was arguing that even in gradual takeoff worlds, we should expect a reasonably high probability of doom if we can&apos;t solve the AI alignment problem. And I&apos;m interested to have this conversation in more detail with people at some point. But yeah, I agree with what Rohin said.</p><p>Overall on takeoff speeds, I guess I still feel pretty uncertain. It seems to me that currently, what we can do with AI, like AI capabilities are increasing consistently, and a lot of this comes from applying relatively non-mindblowing algorithmic ideas to larger amounts of compute and data. And I would be kind of surprised if you can&apos;t basically ride this wave away until you have transformative AI. And so if I want to argue that we&apos;re going to have fast takeoffs, I kind of have to argue that there&apos;s some other approach you can take which lets you build AI without having to go along that slow path, which also will happen first. And I guess I think it&apos;s kind of plausible that that is what&apos;s going to happen. I think that&apos;s what you&apos;d have to argue for if you want to argue for a fast take off.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>That all seems right to me. I&apos;d be surprised if, out of nowhere, we saw a new AI approach suddenly started working and overtook deep learning. You also have to argue that it then very quickly reaches human level AI, which would be quite surprising, right? In some sense, it would have to be something completely novel that we failed to think about in the last 60 years. We&apos;re putting in way more effort now than we were in the last 60 years, but then counter counterpoint is that all of that extra effort is going straight into deep learning. It&apos;s not really searching for completely new paradigm-shifting ways to get to AGI.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>So here&apos;s how I&apos;d make that argument. Perhaps a really important input into a field like AI, is the number of really smart kids who have been wanting to be an AI researcher since they were 16 because they thought that it&apos;s the most important thing in the world. I think that in physics, a lot of the people who turn into physicists have actually wanted to be physicists forever. I think the number of really smart kids who wanted to be AI researchers forever has possibly gone up by a factor of 10 over the last 10 years, it might even be more. And there just are problems sometimes, that are bottle necked on that kind of a thing, probably. And so it wouldn&apos;t be totally shocking to me, if as a result of this particular input to AI radically increasing, we end up in kind of a different situation. I haven&apos;t quite thought through this argument fully.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>Yeah, the argument seems plausible. There&apos;s a large space of arguments like this. I think even after that, then I&apos;ve started questioning, &quot;Okay, we get a new paradigm. The same arguments apply to that paradigm?&quot; Not as strongly. I guess not the arguments you were saying about compute going up over time, but the arguments given in the original slow takeoff posts which were people quickly start taking the low-hanging fruit and then move on. When there&apos;s a lot of effort being put into getting some property, you should expect that easy low-hanging fruit is usually just already taken, and that&apos;s why you don&apos;t expect discontinuities. Unless the new idea just immediately rockets you to human-level AGI, or x-risk causing AGI, I think the same argument would pretty quickly start applying to that as well.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>I think it&apos;s plausible that you do get rocketed pretty quickly to human-level AI. And I agree that this is an insane sounding claim.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>Great. As long as we agree on that.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>Something which has been on my to-do list for a while, and something I&apos;ve been doing a bit of and I&apos;d be excited for someone else doing more of, is reading the history of science and getting more of a sense of what kinds of things are bottlenecked by what, where. It could lead me to be a bit less confused about a bunch of this stuff. AI Impacts has done a lot of great work cataloging all of the things that aren&apos;t discontinuous changes, which certainly is a strong evidence to me against my claim here.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry: </strong>All right. What is the probability of AI-induced existential risk?</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>Unconditional on anything? I might give it 1 in 20. 5%.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>I&apos;d give 50%.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>I had a conversation with AI Impacts that went into this in more detail and partially just anchored on the number I gave there, which was 10% conditional on no intervention from longtermists, I think the broad argument is really just the one that Buck and I were disagreeing about earlier, which is to what extent will society be incentivized to solve the problem? There&apos;s some chance that the first thing we try just works and we don&apos;t even need to solve any sort of alignment problem. It might just be fine. This is not implausible to me. Maybe that&apos;s 30% or something.</p><p>Most of the remaining probability comes from, &quot;Okay, the alignment problem is a real problem. We need to deal with it.&quot; It might be very easy in which case we can just solve it straight away. That might be the case. That doesn&apos;t seem that likely to me if it was a problem at all. But what we will get is a lot of these warning shots and people understanding the risks a lot more as we get more powerful AI systems. This estimate is also conditional on gradual takeoff. I keep forgetting to say that, mostly because I don&apos;t know what probability I should put on discontinuous takeoff.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry: </strong>So is 5% with longtermist intervention, increasing to 10% if fast takeoff?</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>Yes, but still with longtermist intervention. I&apos;m pretty pessimistic on fast takeoff, but my probability assigned to fast takeoff is not very high. In a gradual takeoff world, you get a lot of warning shots. There will just generally be awareness of the fact that the alignment problem is a real thing and you won&apos;t have the situation you have right now of people saying this thing about worrying about superintelligent AI systems not doing what we want is totally bullshit. That won&apos;t be a thing. Almost everyone will not be saying that anymore, in the version where we&apos;re right and there is a problem. As a result, people will not want to build AI systems that are going to kill them. People tend to be pretty risk averse in my estimation of the world, which Buck will probably disagree with. And as a result, you&apos;ll get a lot of people trying to actually work on solving the alignment problem. There&apos;ll be some amount of global coordination which will give us more time to solve the alignment problem than we may otherwise have had. And together, these forces mean that probably we&apos;ll be okay.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>So I think my disagreements with Rohin are basically that I think fast takeoffs are more likely. I basically think there is almost surely a problem. I think that alignment might be difficult, and I&apos;m more pessimistic about coordination. I know I said four things there, but I actually think of this as three disagreements. I want to say that &quot;there isn&apos;t actually a problem&quot; is just a kind of &quot;alignment is really easy to solve.&quot; So then there&apos;s three disagreements. One is gradual takeoff, another is difficulty of solving competitive prosaic alignment, and another is how good we are at coordination.</p><p>I haven&apos;t actually written down these numbers since I last changed my mind about a lot of the inputs to them, so maybe I&apos;m being really dumb. I guess, it feels to me that in fast takeoff worlds, we are very sad unless we have competitive alignment techniques, and so then we&apos;re just only okay if we have these competitive alignment techniques. I guess I would say that I&apos;m something like 30% on us having good competitive alignment techniques by the time that it&apos;s important, which incidentally is higher than Rohin I think.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>Yeah, 30 is totally within the 25th to 75th interval on the probability, which is a weird thing to be reporting. 30 might be my median, I don&apos;t know.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>To be clear, I&apos;m not just including the outer alignment proportion here, which is what we were talking about before with IDA. I&apos;m also including the inner alignment.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>Yeah, 30% does seem a bit high. I think I&apos;m a little more pessimistic.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>So I&apos;m like 30% that we can just solve the AI alignment problem in this excellent way, such that anyone who wants to can have very little extra cost and then make AI systems that are aligned. I feel like in worlds where we did that, it&apos;s pretty likely that things are reasonably okay. I think that the gradual versus fast takeoff isn&apos;t actually enormously much of a crux for me because I feel like in worlds without competitive alignment techniques and gradual takeoff, we still have a very high probability of doom. And I think that comes down to disagreements about coordination. So maybe the main important disagreement between Rohin and I is, actually how well we&apos;ll be able to coordinate, or how strongly individual incentives will be for alignment.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>I think there are other things. The reason I feel a bit more pessimistic than you in the fast takeoff world is just solving problems in advance just is really quite difficult and I really like the ability to be able to test techniques on actual AI systems. You&apos;ll have to work with less powerful things. At some point, you do have to make the jump to more powerful things. But, still, being able to test on the less powerful things, that&#x2019;s so good, so much safety from there.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>It&apos;s not actually clear to me that you get to test the most important parts of your safety techniques. So I think that there are a bunch of safety problems that just do not occur on dog-level AIs, and do occur on human-level AI. If there are three levels of AI, there&apos;s a thing which is as powerful as a dog, there&apos;s a thing which is as powerful as a human, and there&apos;s a thing which is as powerful as a thousand John von Neumanns. In gradual takeoff world, you have a bunch of time in both of these two milestones, maybe. I guess it&apos;s not super clear to me that you can use results on less powerful systems as that much evidence about whether your safety techniques work on drastically more powerful systems. It&apos;s definitely somewhat helpful.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>It depends what you condition on in your difference between continuous takeoff and discontinuous takeoff to say which one of them happens faster. I guess the delta between dog and human is definitely longer in gradual takeoff for sure. Okay, if that&apos;s what you were saying, yep, I agree with that.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>Yeah, sorry, that&apos;s all I meant.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>Cool. One thing I wanted to ask is when you say dog-level AI assistant, do you mean something like a neural net that if put in a dog&apos;s body replacing its brain would do about as well as a dog? Because such a neural net could then be put in other environments and learn to become really good at other things, probably superhuman at many things that weren&apos;t in the ancestral environment. Do you mean that sort of thing?</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>Yeah, that&apos;s what I mean. Dog-level AI is probably much better than GPT2 at answering questions. I&apos;m going to define something as dog-level AI, if it&apos;s about as good as a dog at things which I think dogs are pretty heavily optimized for, like visual processing or motor control in novel scenarios or other things like that, that I think dogs are pretty good at.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>Makes sense. So I think in that case, plausibly, dog-level AI already poses an existential risk. I can believe that too.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>Yeah.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>The AI cashier example feels like it could totally happen probably before a dog-level AI. You&apos;ve got all of the motivation problems already at that point of the game, and I don&apos;t know what problems you expect to see beyond then.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>I&apos;m more talking about whether you can test your solutions. I&apos;m not quite sure how to say my intuitions here. I feel like there are various strategies which work for corralling dogs and which don&apos;t work for making humans do what you want. In as much as your alignment strategy is aiming at a flavor of problem that only occurs when you have superhuman things, you don&apos;t get to test that either way. I don&apos;t think this is a super important point unless you think it is. I guess I feel good about moving on from here.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>Mm-hmm (affirmative). Sounds good to me.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry: </strong>Okay, we&apos;ve talked about what you guys have called gradual and fast takeoff scenarios, or continuous and discontinuous. Could you guys put some probabilities down on the likelihood of, and stories that you have in your head, for fast and slow takeoff scenarios?</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>That is a hard question. There are two sorts of reasoning I do about probabilities. One is: use my internal simulation of whatever I&apos;m trying to predict, internally simulate what it looks like, whether it&apos;s by my own models, is it likely? How likely is it? At what point would I be willing to bet on it. Stuff like that. And then there&apos;s a separate extra step where I&apos;m like, &quot;What do other people think about this? Oh, a lot of people think this thing that I assigned one percent probability to is very likely. Hmm, I should probably not be saying one percent then.&quot; I don&apos;t know how to do that second part for, well, most things but especially in this setting. So I&apos;m going to just report Rohin&apos;s model only, which will predictably be understating the probability for fast takeoff in that if someone from MIRI were to talk to me for five hours, I would probably say a higher number for the probability of fast takeoff after that, and I know that that&apos;s going to happen. I&apos;m just going to ignore that fact and report my own model anyway.</p><p>On my own model, it&apos;s something like in worlds where AGI happens soon, like in the next couple of decades, then I&apos;m like, &quot;Man, 95% on gradual take off.&quot; If it&apos;s further away, like three to five decades, then I&apos;m like, &quot;Some things could have changed by then, maybe I&apos;m 80%.&quot; And then if it&apos;s way off into the future and centuries, then I&apos;m like, &quot;Ah, maybe it&apos;s 70%, 65%.&quot; The reason it goes down over time is just because it seems to me like if you want to argue for discontinuous takeoff, you need to posit that there&apos;s some paradigm change in how AI progress is happening and that seems more likely the further in the future you go.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>I feel kind of surprised that you get so low, like to 65% or 70%. I would have thought that those arguments are a strong default and then maybe at the moment where in a position that seems particularly gradual takeoff-y, but I would have thought that you over time get to 80% or something.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>Yeah. Maybe my internal model is like, &quot;Holy shit, why do these MIRI people keep saying that discontinuous takeoff is so obvious.&quot; I agree that the arguments in Paul&apos;s posts feel very compelling to me and so maybe I should just be more confident in them. I think saying 80%, even in centuries is plausibly a correct answer.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry: </strong>So, Rohin, is the view here that since compute is the thing that&apos;s being leveraged to make most AI advances that you would expect that to be the mechanism by which that continues to happen in the future and we have some certainty over how compute continues to change into the future? Whereas things that would be leading to a discontinuous takeoff would be world-shattering, fundamental insights into algorithms that would have powerful recursive self-improvement, which is something you wouldn&apos;t necessarily see if we just keep going this leveraging compute route?</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>Yeah, I think that&apos;s a pretty good summary. Again, on the backdrop of the default argument for this is people are really trying to build AGI. It would be pretty surprising if there is just this really important thing that everyone had just missed.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>It sure seems like in machine learning when I look at the things which have happened over the last 20 years, all of them feel like the ideas are kind of obvious or someone else had proposed them 20 years earlier. ConvNets were proposed 20 years before they were good on ImageNet, and LSTMs were ages before they were good for natural language, and so on and so on and so on. Other subjects are not like this, like in physics sometimes they just messed around for 50 years before they knew what was happening. I don&apos;t know, I feel confused how to feel about the fact that in some subjects, it feels like they just do suddenly get better at things for reasons other than having more compute.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>I think physics, at least, was often bottlenecked by measurements, I want to say.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>Yes, so this is one reason I&apos;ve been interested in history of science recently, but there are certainly a bunch of things. People were interested in chemistry for a long time and it turns out that chemistry comes from quantum mechanics and you could, theoretically, have guessed quantum mechanics 70 years earlier than people did if you were smart enough. It&apos;s not that complicated a hypothesis to think of. Or relativity is the classic example of something which could have been invented 50 years earlier. I don&apos;t know, I would love to learn more about this.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry: </strong>Just to tie this back to the question, could you give your probabilities as well?</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>Oh, geez, I don&apos;t know. Honestly, right now I feel like I&apos;m 70% gradual takeoff or something, but I don&apos;t know. I might change my mind if I think about this for another hour. And there&apos;s also theoretical arguments as well for why most takeoffs are gradual, like the stuff in Paul&apos;s post. The easiest summary is, before someone does something really well, someone else does it kind of well in cases where a lot of people are trying to do the thing.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry: </strong>Okay. One facet of this, that I haven&apos;t heard discussed, is recursive self-improvement, and I&apos;m confused about where that becomes the thing that affects whether it&apos;s discontinuous or continuous. If someone does something kind of well before something does something really well, if recursive self-improvement is a property of the thing being done kind of well, is it just kind of self-improving really quickly, or?</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>Yeah. I think Paul&apos;s post does a great job of talking about this exact argument. I think his basic claim is, which I find pretty plausible, before you have a system which is really good at self-improving, you have a system which is kind of good at self-improving, if it turns out to be really helpful to have a system be good at self-improving. And as soon as this is true, you have to posit an additional discontinuity.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>One other thing I&apos;d note is that humans are totally self improving. Productivity techniques, for example, are a form of self-improvement. You could imagine that AI systems might have advantages that humans don&apos;t, like being able to read their own weights and edit them directly. How much of an advantage this gives to the AI system, unclear. Still, I think then I just go back to the argument that Buck already made, which is at some point you get to an AI system that is somewhat good at understanding its weights and figuring out how to edit them, and that happens before you get the really powerful ones. Maybe this is like saying, &quot;Well, you&apos;ll reach human levels of self-improvement by the time you have rat-level AI or something instead of human-level AI,&quot; which argues that you&apos;ll hit this hyperbolic point of the curve earlier, but it still looks like a hyperbolic curve that&apos;s still continuous at every point.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>I agree.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry: </strong>I feel just generally surprised about your probabilities on continuous takeoff scenarios that they&apos;d be slow.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>The reason I&apos;m trying to avoid the word slow and fast is because they&apos;re misleading. Slow takeoff is not slow in calendar time relative to fast takeoff. The question is, is there a spike at some point? Some people, upon reading Paul&apos;s posts are like, &quot;Slow takeoff is faster than fast takeoff.&quot; That&apos;s a reasonably common reaction to it.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>I would put it as slow takeoff is the claim that things are insane before you have the human-level AI.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>Yeah.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry: </strong>This seems like a helpful perspective shift on this takeoff scenario question. I have not read Paul&apos;s post. What is it called so that we can include it in the page for this podcast?</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>It&apos;s just called Takeoff Speeds. Then the corresponding AI Impacts post is called Will AI See Discontinuous Progress?, I believe.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry: </strong>So if each of you guys had a lot more reach and influence and power and resources to bring to the AI alignment problem right now, what would you do?</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>I get this question a lot and my response is always, &quot;Man, I don&apos;t know.&quot; It seems hard to scalably use people right now for AI risk. I can talk about which areas of research I&apos;d like to see more people focus on. If you gave me people where I&apos;m like, &quot;I trust your judgment on your ability to do good conceptual work&quot; or something, where would I put them? I think a lot of it would be on making good robust arguments for AI risk. I don&apos;t think we really have them, which seems like kind of a bad situation to be in. I think I would also invest a lot more in having good introductory materials, like this review, except this review is a little more aimed at people who are already in the field. It is less aimed at people who are trying to enter the field. I think we just have pretty terrible resources for people coming into the field and that should change.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>I think that our resources are way better than they used to be.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>That seems true.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>In the course of my work, I talk to a lot of people who are new to AI alignment about it and I would say that their level of informedness is drastically better now than it was two years ago. A lot of which is due to things like 80,000 hours podcast, and other things like this podcast and the Alignment Newsletter, and so on. I think we just have made it somewhat easier for people to get into everything. The Alignment Forum, having its sequences prominently displayed, and so on.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>Yeah, you named literally all of the things I would have named. Buck definitely has more information on this than I do. I do not work with people who are entering the field as much. I do think we could be substantially better.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>Yes. I feel like I do have access to resources, not directly but in the sense that I know people at eg Open Philanthropy and the EA Funds&#xA0; and if I thought there were obvious things they should do, I think it&apos;s pretty likely that those funders would have already made them happen. And I occasionally embark on projects myself that I think are good for AI alignment, mostly on the outreach side. On a few occasions over the last year, I&apos;ve just done projects that I was optimistic about. So I don&apos;t think I can name things that are just shovel-ready opportunities for someone else to do, which is good news because it&apos;s mostly because I think most of these things are already being done.</p><p>I am enthusiastic about workshops. I help run with MIRI these AI Risks for Computer Scientists workshops and I ran my own computing workshop with some friends, with kind of a similar purpose, aimed at people who are interested in this kind of stuff and who would like to spend some time learning more about it. I feel optimistic about this kind of project as a way of doing the thing Rohin was saying, making it easier for people to start having really deep thoughts about a lot of AI alignment stuff. So that&apos;s a kind of direction of projects that I&apos;m pretty enthusiastic about. A couple other random AI alignment things I&apos;m optimistic about. I&apos;ve already mentioned that I think there should be an Ought competitor just because it seems like the kind of thing that more work could go into. I agree with Rohin on it being good to have more conceptual analysis of a bunch of this stuff. I&apos;m generically enthusiastic about there being more high quality research done and more smart people, who&apos;ve thought about this a lot, working on it as best as they can.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>I think the actual bottleneck is good research and not necessarily field building, and I&apos;m more optimistic about good research. Specifically, I am particularly interested in universality, interpretability. I would love for there to be some way to give people who work on AI alignment the chance to step back and think about the high-level picture for a while. I don&apos;t know if people don&apos;t do this because they don&apos;t want to or because they don&apos;t feel like they have the affordance to do so, and I would like the affordance to be there. I&apos;d be very interested in people building models of what AGI systems could look like. Expected utility maximizers are one example of a model that you could have. Maybe we just try to redo evolution. We just create a very complicated, diverse environment with lots of agents going around and in their multi-agent interaction, they develop general intelligence somehow. I&apos;d be interested for someone to take that scenario, flesh it out more, and then talk about what the alignment problem looks like in that setting.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>I would love to have someone get really knowledgeable about evolutionary biology and try and apply analogies of that to AI alignment. I think that evolutionary biology has lots of smart things to say about what optimizers are and it&apos;d be great to have those insights. I think Eliezer sort of did this many years ago. It would be good for more people to do this in my opinion.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry: </strong>All right. We&apos;re in the home stretch here. AI timelines. What do you think about the current state of predictions? There&apos;s been surveys that have been done with people giving maybe 50% probability over most researchers at about 2050 or so. What are each of your AI timelines? What&apos;s your probability distribution look like? What do you think about the state of predictions on this?</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>Haven&apos;t looked at the state of predictions in a while. It depends on who was surveyed. I think most people haven&apos;t thought about it very much and I don&apos;t know if I expect their predictions to be that good, but maybe wisdom of the crowds is a real thing. I don&apos;t think about it very much. I mostly use my inside view and talk to a bunch of people. Maybe, median, 30 years from now, which is 2050. So I guess I agree with them, don&apos;t I? That feels like an accident. The surveys were not an input into this process.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry: </strong>Okay, Buck?</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>I don&apos;t know what I think my overall timelines are. I think AI in the next 10 or 20 years is pretty plausible. Maybe I want to give it something around 50% which puts my median at around 2040. In terms of the state of things that people have said about AI timelines, I have had some really great conversations with people about their research on AI timelines which hasn&apos;t been published yet. But at some point in the next year, I think it&apos;s pretty likely that much better stuff about AI timelines modeling will have been published than has currently been published, so I&apos;m excited for that.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry: </strong>All right. Information hazards. Originally, there seemed to be a lot of worry in the community about information hazards and even talking about superintelligence and being afraid of talking to anyone in positions of power, whether they be in private institutions or in government, about the strategic advantage of AI, about how one day it may confer a decisive strategic advantage. The dissonance here for me is that Putin comes out and says that who controls AI will control the world. Nick Bostrom published Superintelligence, which basically says what I already said. Max Tegmark&apos;s Life 3.0 basically also. My initial reaction and intuition is the cat&apos;s out of the bag. I don&apos;t think that echoing this increases risks any further than the risk is already at. But maybe you disagree.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>Yeah. So here are two opinions I have about info hazards. One is: how bad is it to say stuff like that all over the internet? My guess is it&apos;s mildly bad because I think that not everyone thinks those things. I think that even if you could get those opinions as consequences from reading Superintelligence, I think that most people in fact have not read Superintelligence. Sometimes there are ideas where I just really don&apos;t want them to be crystallized common knowledge. I think that, to a large extent, assuming gradual takeoff worlds, it kind of doesn&apos;t matter because AI systems are going to be radically transforming the world inevitably. I guess you can affect how governments think about it, but it&apos;s a bit different there.</p><p>The other point I want to make about info hazards is I think there are a bunch of trickinesses with AI safety, where thinking about AI safety makes you think about questions about how AI development might go. I think that thinking about how AI development is going to go occasionally leads to think about things that are maybe, could be, relevant to capabilities, and I think that this makes it hard to do research because you then get scared about talking about them.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>So I think my take on this is info hazards are real in the sense that there, in fact, are costs to saying specific kinds of information and publicizing them a bit. I think I&apos;ll agree in principle that some kinds of capabilities information has the cost of accelerating timelines. I usually think these are pretty strongly outweighed by the benefits in that it just seems really hard to be able to do any kind of shared intellectual work when you&apos;re constantly worried about what you do and don&apos;t make public. It really seems like if you really want to build a shared understanding within the field of AI alignment, that benefit is worth saying things that might be bad in some other ways. This depends on a lot of background facts that I&apos;m not going to cover here but, for example, I probably wouldn&apos;t say the same thing about bio security.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry: </strong>Okay. That makes sense. Thanks for your opinions on this. So at the current state in time, do you guys think that people should be engaging with people in government or in policy spheres on questions of AI alignment?</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>Yes, but not in the sense of we&apos;re worried about when AGI comes. Even saying things like it might be really bad, as opposed to saying it might kill everybody, seems not great. Mostly on the basis of my model for what it takes to get governments to do things is, at the very least, you need consensus in the field so it seems kind of pointless to try right now. It might even be poisoning the well for future efforts. I think it does make sense to engage with government and policymakers about things that are in fact problems right now. To the extent that you think that recommender systems are causing a lot of problems, I think it makes sense to engage with government about how alignment-like techniques can help with that, especially if you&apos;re doing a bunch of specification learning-type stuff. That seems like the sort of stuff that should have relevance today and I think it would be great if those of us who did specification learning were trying to use it to improve existing systems.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>This isn&apos;t my field. I trust the judgment of a lot of other people. I think that it&apos;s plausible that it&apos;s worth building relationships with governments now, not that I know what I&apos;m talking about. I will note that I basically have only seen people talk about how to do AI governance in the cases where the AI safety problem is 90th percentile easiest. I basically only see people talking about it in the case where the technical safety problem is pretty doable, and this concerns me. I&apos;ve just never seen anyone talk about what you do in a world where you&apos;re as pessimistic as I am, except to completely give up.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry: </strong>All right. Wrapping up here, is there anything else that we didn&apos;t talk about that you guys think was important? Or something that we weren&apos;t able to spend enough time on, that you would&apos;ve liked to spend more time on?</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>I do want to eventually continue the conversation with Buck about coordination, but that does seem like it should happen not on this podcast.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>That&apos;s what I was going to say too. Something that I want someone to do is write a trajectory for how AI goes down, that is really specific about what the world GDP is in every one of the years from now until insane intelligence explosion. And just write down what the world is like in each of those years because I don&apos;t know how to write an internally consistent, plausible trajectory. I don&apos;t know how to write even one of those for anything except a ridiculously fast takeoff. And this feels like a real shame.</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>That seems good to me as well. And also the sort of thing that I could not do because I don&apos;t know economics.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry: </strong>All right, so let&apos;s wrap up here then. So if listeners are interested in following either of you or seeing more of your blog posts or places where you would recommend they read more materials on AI alignment, where can they do that? We&apos;ll start with you, Buck.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>You can Google me and find my website. I often post things on the Effective Altruism Forum. If you want to talk to me about AI alignment in person, perhaps you should apply to the AI Risks for Computer Scientists workshops run by MIRI.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry: </strong>And Rohin?</p><p><strong>Rohin Shah: </strong>I write the Alignment Newsletter. That&apos;s a thing that you could sign up for. Also on my website, if you Google Rohin Shah Alignment Newsletter, I&apos;m sure I will come up. These are also cross posted to the Alignment Forum, so another thing you can do is go to the Alignment Forum, look up my username and just see things that are there. I don&apos;t know that this is actually the thing that you want to be doing. If you&apos;re new to AI safety and want to learn more about it, I would echo the resources Buck mentioned earlier, which are the 80k podcasts about AI alignment. There are probably on the order of five of these. There&apos;s the Alignment Newsletter. There are the three recommended sequences on the Alignment Forum. Just go to alignmentforum.org and look under recommended sequences. And this podcast, of course.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry: </strong>All right. Heroic job, everyone. This is going to be a really good resource, I think. It&apos;s given me a lot of perspective on how thinking has changed over the past year or two.</p><p><strong>Buck Shlegeris: </strong>And we can listen to it again in a year and see how dumb we are.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry: </strong>Yeah. There were lots of predictions and probabilities given today, so it&apos;ll be interesting to see how things are in a year or two from now. That&apos;ll be great. All right, so cool.

Sadly, this does not give us an effective strategy for controlling hurricane trajectories - if a flap of my butterfly&#x2019;s wings can change the hurricane&#x2019;s course, then so can the flap of any other butterfly&#x2019;s wings. Unless I know exactly how all of the world&#x2019;s butterflies are flapping, I do not know how my own butterfly&#x2019;s wings must flap to achieve the course I want.</p><p>On the other hand, even though I do not know how the vast majority of the world&#x2019;s butterflies are flapping, it is far easier to estimate a <em>distribution</em> of possible hurricane-paths in my state of ignorance than it would be to compute the exact hurricane path in a state of full knowledge.</p><p><figure><img src=""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/mkv9DM6d57e6K1Qtg5KlObkYs5NE_6iVAV5PmbJyylUBzwWTrbzBMm5SgAkg-Taif_8yjwK7lWSQWQvu_0trObv-bxz3XAdhbpq9e5oYHlhXP7swdRu7_YC-lo120km2be3WC1wr"" class=""draft-image "" style=""width:624%""></figure></p><p>In general, we usually think of computing with uncertainty as harder than computing without it - Bayesian reasoning requires tracking all possible worlds, which is exponentially more difficult than just tracking one. Yet in practice, uncertainty often makes large systems simpler to reason about. Why? Because noise wipes out long-range correlations. Unless I know how the wings of <em>all</em> the world&#x2019;s butterflies are flapping, the flapping of any particular butterfly gives me no information at all about the path of a hurricane. So in practice, weather forecasters do not need to worry about tracking butterflies.</p><p>Let&#x2019;s look at a toy model, to build some intuition for this idea.</p><p>I have a long list of randomly-chosen numbers between 1 and 10, and I want to know whether their sum is even or odd. If I know all of the numbers, then I can perform a relatively complicated calculation: I can add them all up, divide by 2, and find the remainder. But if there is even just <em>one</em> number in the list whose value I do not know, then all the rest of the numbers tell me <em>absolutely nothing</em> about whether the sum is even or odd. Even just a little bit of noise wipes out all of the signal completely.</p><p>On the other hand, if I don&#x2019;t know the values of one or more of the numbers, then my &#x201C;model&#x201D; for this system is much simpler: whether the sum is even or odd is independent of all the numbers I know. If I&#x2019;m reasoning about the sum, I can just forget about all those numbers entirely. In this sense, noise makes the system much simpler to reason about; there&#x2019;s no need for all that addition and division, and we don&#x2019;t even need to remember the numbers.</p><p>A rough general insight from this model: if changing any input of a system changes the output, then a complete lack of information about <em>any</em> input implies a complete lack of information about the output - no matter how much information we have about all the other inputs. When a system is very sensitive to all of its inputs, just a little bit of noise makes all of our information about the inputs irrelevant - which makes the system much simpler to model.</p><p>On the other hand, what if a system is <em>not</em> very sensitive to all of its inputs? Well, then we can build simplified approximate models of the system anyway, just by using rough estimates for whatever inputs it isn&#x2019;t very sensitive to. There&#x2019;s a kind of duality here: if the system isn&#x2019;t very sensitive, we can model it well as only depending on some coarse estimates of the inputs; if it is very sensitive, we can model it as independent of most inputs as long as just a few are unknown.</p>",johnswentworth,johnswentworth,johnswentworth,

At the top level, &quot;make AI go well&quot; is decomposed into making AI competent, making AI aligned, and coping with the impacts of AI. Paul focuses on the alignment part, which he defines as building AI systems that are <em>trying</em> to do what we want. See <strong><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/ZeE7EKHTFMBs8eMxn/clarifying-ai-alignment"">Clarifying &quot;AI Alignment&quot;</a></strong> (<strong><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/b6dc636f6a1b/alignment-newsletter-33"">AN #33</a></strong>) and <strong><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/ZeE7EKHTFMBs8eMxn/clarifying-ai-alignment#3ECKoYzFNW2ZqS6km"">my comment on it</a></strong>. Paul considers many problems of competence as separate from alignment, including understanding humans well, and most reliability / robustness work.</p><p>2. Within alignment, we can consider the concept of an &quot;alignment tax&quot;: the cost incurred by insisting that we only deploy aligned AI. One approach is to help pay the alignment tax, for example, by convincing important actors that they should care about alignment, or by adopting agreements that make it easier to coordinate to pay the tax, as with the <strong><a href=""https://blog.openai.com/openai-charter/"">OpenAI Charter</a></strong> (<strong><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/14782876a85d/alignment-newsletter-2"">AN #2</a></strong>)). Technical AI safety research on the other hand can help <em>reduce</em> the alignment tax, by creating better aligned AI systems (which consequently incur less cost than before).</p><p>3. With alignment tax reduction, we could either try to advance current alignable algorithms (making them more competent, and so reducing their tax), or make existing algorithms alignable. It would be particularly nice to take some general class of algorithms (such as deep reinforcement learning) and figure out how to transform them to make them alignable, such that improvements to the algorithms automatically translate to improvements in the alignable version. This is what Paul works on.</p><p>4. The next layer is simply a decomposition of possible algorithms we could try to align, e.g. planning, deduction, and learning. Paul focuses on learning.</p><p>5. Within aligned learning, we can distinguish between outer alignment (finding an objective that incentivizes aligned behavior) and inner alignment (ensuring that the trained agent robustly pursues the aligned objective). Paul works primarily on outer alignment, but has <strong><a href=""https://ai-alignment.com/training-robust-corrigibility-ce0e0a3b9b4d"">written about inner alignment</a></strong> (<strong><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/6078fe4f9928/an-81-universality-as-a-potential-solution-to-conceptual-difficulties-in-intent-alignment"">AN #81</a></strong>).</p><p>6. Within outer alignment, we could either consider algorithms that learn from a teacher, such as imitiation learning or preference inference, or we could find algorithms that perform better than the teacher (as would be needed for superhuman performance). Paul focuses on the latter case.</p><p>7. To go beyond the teacher, you could extrapolate beyond what you&apos;ve seen (i.e. generalization), do some sort of <strong><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/5eX8ko7GCxwR5N9mN/what-is-ambitious-value-learning"">ambitious value learning</a></strong> (<strong><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/7d0e3916e3d9/alignment-newsletter-31"">AN #31</a></strong>), or build a better teacher. Paul focuses on the last case, and thinks of amplification as a way to achieve this.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> I really like this decomposition. I already laid out most of my thoughts back when I summarized just the <strong><a href=""https://ai-alignment.com/ai-alignment-landscape-d3773c37ae38"">main slide</a></strong> (<strong><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/49c956f84771/an-74separating-beneficial-ai-into-competence-alignment-and-coping-with-impacts"">AN #74</a></strong>); I still endorse them.</p><h1>TECHNICAL AI ALIGNMENT </h1><h2>ITERATED AMPLIFICATION </h2><p><strong><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09758"">Unsupervised Question Decomposition for Question Answering</a></strong> <em>(Ethan Perez et al)</em> (summarized by Zach): Existing methods are proficient at simple question and answering (QA). These simple questions are called single-hop and can be answered with a single yes/no or underlined passage in the text. However, progress on the more difficult task of multi-hop QA lags behind. <strong>This paper introduces a method that can decompose hard multi-hop questions into easier single-hop questions that existing QA systems can answer.</strong> Since collecting labeled decompositions is hard, the authors introduce a pseudo-decomposition where multi-hop questions are matched with similar single-hop questions while making sure the single-hop questions are diverse. Following this, the model is trained to map multi-hop questions to simpler subquestions using <em>unsupervised</em> sequence-to-sequence learning (as they found the supervised version performed worse). They show large improvement on the popular HotPot QA baseline with large improvement on out-of-domain questions due to the ability of sub-questions to help gather supporting facts that can be used to answer questions. </p><p><strong>Zach&apos;s opinion:</strong> A core feature of this paper is the unsupervised approach to producing question decompositions. By doing this, it&apos;s possible to augment the data-set significantly by question-crawling the data-sets which helps explain why the model has performance on-par with supervised approaches. Moreover, looking at a few decomposition examples from the model seems to indicate that relevant sub-questions are being discovered. It&apos;s worth noting that decompositions with more than two questions are unlikely due to the specific loss used in the main paper. In the appendix, the authors experiment with a different loss for the pseudo-decomposition that allows more questions in the decomposition, but it performs slightly worse than the original loss. This makes me wonder whether or not such a procedure would be useful if used recursively to create sub-sub-questions. Overall, I think the decomposition is useful for both down-stream processing and interpretation.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> The capabilities of methods like iterated amplification depend on the ability to solve hard questions by decomposing them into simpler questions that we already know how to answer, and then combining the results appropriately. This paper demonstrates that even a very basic unsupervised approach (&quot;decompose into the most similar simpler questions&quot;) to decomposition can work quite well, at least for current AI systems.</p><p>In private correspondence, Ethan suggested that in the long term a semi-supervised approach would probably work best, which agrees with my intuitions.</p><h2>AGENT FOUNDATIONS </h2><p><strong><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/A8iGaZ3uHNNGgJeaD/an-orthodox-case-against-utility-functions"">An Orthodox Case Against Utility Functions</a></strong> <em>(Abram Demski)</em> (summarized by Rohin): How might we theoretically ground utility functions? One approach could be to view the possible environments as a set of universe histories (e.g. a list of the positions of all quarks, etc. at all times), and a utility function as a function that maps these universe histories to real numbers. We might want this utility function to be computable, but this eliminates some plausible preferences we might want to represent. For example, in the procrastination paradox, the subject prefers to push the button as late as possible, but disprefers never pressing the button. If the history is infinitely long, no computable function can know for sure that the button was never pressed: it&apos;s always possible that it was pressed at some later day.</p><p>Instead, we could use <em>subjective utility functions</em>, which are defined over <em>events</em>, which is basically anything you can think about (i.e. it could be chairs and tables, or quarks and strings). This allows us to have utility functions over high level concepts. In the previous example, we can define an event &quot;never presses the button&quot;, and reason about that event atomically, sidestepping the issues of computability.</p><p>We could go further and view <em>probabilities</em> as subjective (as in the Jeffrey-Bolkor axioms), and only require that our beliefs are updated in such a way that we cannot be Dutch-booked. This is the perspective taken in logical induction.</p><h2>INTERPRETABILITY </h2><p><strong><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09815"">Neuron Shapley: Discovering the Responsible Neurons</a></strong> <em>(Amirata Ghorbani et al)</em> (summarized by Robert): This paper presents a novel method, Neuron Shapley, that uses the <strong><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapley_value"">Shapley value framework</a></strong> to measure the importance of different neurons in determining an arbitrary metric of the neural net output. (Shapley values have been applied to machine learning before to <strong><a href=""https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/shapley.html"">measure the importance of features to a model&apos;s output</a></strong>, but here the authors use them to calculate neuron importance.) Due to several novel approaches and optimisations in calculating these Shapley values, <strong>the top k most responsible neurons (k ~ 30) can be feasibly found for large networks such as Inception-v3</strong>.</p><p>The authors demonstrate that finding these neurons enables the performance of model surgery. Removing the top 30 neurons that contribute to accuracy completely destroys the accuracy, whereas in expectation removing 30 neurons at random from the network barely moves the accuracy at all. Since the method can be applied to an arbitrary metric, this kind of surgery can be performed for other metrics we care about. For example, removing the neurons which are most responsible for vulnerability to adversarial attacks makes the network more robust, and removing the neurons most responsible for the class-accuracy imbalance (a fairness metric) makes the classes much more even, while only reducing the overall accuracy by a small amount.</p><p><strong>Robert&apos;s opinion:</strong> It&apos;s nice to see an interpretability method with demonstrable and measurable use cases. Many methods aim at improving insight, but often don&apos;t demonstrate this aim; I think this paper does this well in showing how its method can be used for model surgery. I think methods that allow us to investigate and understand individual neurons and their contributions are useful in building up a fine grained picture of how neural networks work. This links to previous work such as <strong><a href=""http://netdissect.csail.mit.edu/"">Network Dissection</a></strong> as well as the recent <strong><a href=""https://distill.pub/2020/circuits/"">Circuits Thread</a></strong> on Distill, and I&apos;d love to see how these methods interact. They all give different kinds of understanding, and I think it would be interesting to see if given the results of the circuits tools we were able to predict which neurons where most responsible for different metrics (Neuron Shapley) or aligned to which relevant features (Network Dissection).</p><p><strong><a href=""https://distill.pub/2020/grand-tour/"">Visualizing Neural Networks with the Grand Tour</a></strong> <em>(Mingwei Li et al)</em> (summarized by Flo): Visualizing a complete dataset instead of single input examples is helpful when we want to analyze the relationships between different input examples and how their classification changes during training, as we can do so by looking at a single video. </p><p>The authors use an example on MNIST in which the network learns to classify the numbers 1 and 7 in an almost discrete fashion during particular epochs to compare different methods for visualizing how the dataset is classified. They find that one problem with nonlinear dimensionality reduction like t-SNE and UMAPs is that changes to a subset of the dataset can strongly affect how unchanged data points are represented. Then they compare this to the Grand Tour, a classical technique that projects the data into two dimensions from varying points of view. As projections are linear in the input variables, it is rather easy to reason about how changes in the data affect this visualization and the times the classes 1 and 7 are learnt are indeed quite salient in their example. Another advantage of this method is that confusion between two specific classes can be identified more easily, as the corresponding data points will be projected onto the line connecting the clusters for these classes. A similar approach can be taken on a network&apos;s hidden layers to identify the layer in which different classes become clearly distinguishable. They find that they can identify adversarial examples generated by FGSM by looking at the second to last layer, where the adversarial examples form a cluster distinct from the real images. </p><p>As the Grand Tour involves varying rotations, it is basically unaffected by rotations of the data. The authors argue that this is a feature, as rotations are small changes to the data and should not have a large effect on the visualization.</p><p><strong>Flo&apos;s opinion:</strong> The dataset perspective on visualization seems pretty useful as a quick diagnostic tool for practitioners, but less useful than feature visualization for a detailed understanding of a model. While I think that it is good to highlight invariances, I am not convinced that rotational invariance is actually desirable for visualizing intermediate layers of a neural network, as most nonlinearities are strongly affected by rotations. </p><h2>FORECASTING </h2><p><strong><a href=""https://aiimpacts.org/atari-early/"">Atari early</a></strong> <em>(Katja Grace)</em> (summarized by Rohin): With DeepMind&apos;s Agent57 (summarized below), it seems that it is feasible to outperform professional game testers on all Atari games using no game-specific knowledge. Interestingly, in a 2016 survey, the median response put a small chance (10%) on this being feasible by 2021, and a medium chance (50%) of being feasible by 2026.</p><h1>OTHER PROGRESS IN AI </h1><h2>REINFORCEMENT LEARNING </h2><p><strong><a href=""https://deepmind.com/blog/article/Agent57-Outperforming-the-human-Atari-benchmark"">Agent57: Outperforming the human Atari benchmark</a></strong> <em>(Adri&#xE0; Puigdom&#xE8;nech Badia, Bilal Piot, Steven Kapturowski, Pablo Sprechmann et al)</em> (summarized by Sudhanshu): This blogpost and its associated <strong><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13350"">arxiv publication</a></strong> present Agent57, DeepMind&apos;s latest RL agent created for the purpose of achieving human-level performance in a suite of 57 Atari games. Notably, Agent57 is the first agent that is able to surpass average human performance, as measured by Human Normalized Score or HNS, on every individual game in the suite, with the same set of hyperparameters. The blogpost details the evolution of DeepMind&apos;s Atari agents from DQN up to Agent57, and the paper elaborates on the improvements made in Agent57.</p><p>Specifically, Agent57 builds on a recent agent &apos;Never Give Up&apos; (NGU), which itself augments R2D2 with episodic memory for curiosity-driven exploration. Agent57 introduces (i) a new parameterization of state-action value function that decomposes into intrinsic and extrinsic rewards, and (ii) a meta-controller which selects which of its numerous distributed policies to prioritize during learning, allowing the agent to control the exploration/exploitation trade-off.</p><p><strong>Read more:</strong> <strong><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13350"">Paper: Agent57: Outperforming the Atari Human Benchmark</a></strong></p><p><strong>Sudhanshu&apos;s opinion:</strong> On the one hand, this work feels like the achievement of an important milestone in DeepMind&apos;s ongoing research agenda towards building more general agents. On the other hand, it has the flavour of engineered sophistry: a remarkable collection of building blocks arranged together to patch specific known weaknesses, but lacking in core insights about how to make agents more general, without, say, making them more complex.</p><p>The work is well presented and accessible, especially the blogpost that contains a snapshot of the functional development of deep reinforcement learning capabilities over time. There are several open questions from here on out; personally, I hope this progresses to a single instance of an agent that is proficient at multiple games, and to the design of agents that do not require extensive hyperparameter tuning. The scale of DeepMind&apos;s experiments continues to grow, with 256 actors, and 10s of billions of frames, suggesting that, for now, this work is only suitable for simulated environments.</p><p><strong><a href=""https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/03/massively-scaling-reinforcement.html"">Massively Scaling Reinforcement Learning with SEED RL</a></strong> <em>(Lasse Espeholt, Rapha&#xEB;l Marinier, Piotr Stanczyk et al)</em> (summarized by Nicholas): Deep learning has <strong><a href=""https://blog.openai.com/ai-and-compute/"">historically</a></strong> (<strong><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/3e550712419a/alignment-newsletter-7"">AN #7</a></strong>) seen many improvements as a result of scaling to larger models with larger amounts of computation, as with the months-long training of <strong><a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.06680"">OpenAI Five</a></strong> (<strong><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/7ba40faa7eed/an-82-how-openai-five-distributed-their-training-computation"">AN #82</a></strong>) and <strong><a href=""https://deepmind.com/blog/alphastar-mastering-real-time-strategy-game-starcraft-ii/"">AlphaStar</a></strong> (<strong><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/768a8130013f/alignment-newsletter-43"">AN #43</a></strong>). SEED RL redesigns the architecture of distributed RL to enable better machine utilization and communication and achieves an order of magnitude improvement in training speed. </p><p>Current distributed architectures typically separate machines into <em>actors</em> and <em>learners</em>. <em>Actors</em> are typically CPUs that simulate the environment, and run inference to predict agent actions. They then send <em>trajectories</em> to the <em>learners</em>. <em>Learners</em> are typically accelerators (GPUs or TPUs), which are responsible for training the model. They then send the updated model parameters to the <em>actors</em>. </p><p>SEED RL addresses 3 main issues in this setup:</p><p>1. Inference could benefit from specialized accelerators</p><p>2. Sending model parameters and states requires high bandwidth.</p><p>3. Environment simulation and inference are very different tasks and having them on the same machine makes it hard to utilize the resource efficiently. </p><p>The solution is to instead have actors <strong>only</strong> simulate the environment. After each step, they send the resulting observation to the <em>learner</em>, which is responsible for both training and inference, possibly split on separate hardware. It then sends back just the actions to the environment. This enables each piece of hardware to be used for its designed purpose. Since they now need to communicate at each step, they use gRPC to minimize latency.</p><p><strong>Read more:</strong> <strong><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.06591"">Paper: SEED RL: Scalable and Efficient Deep-RL with Accelerated Central Inference</a></strong></p><p><strong>Nicholas&apos; opinion:</strong> Given how compute-intensive deep RL is, I think it is quite useful to enable cheaper and faster training before these algorithms can be broadly useful. Their claimed speedup is quite impressive, and I like how well they can separate the training and inference from the simulation. I expect that specialized hardware for both training and inference will soon become the norm and SEED RL seems like it will scale well as those accelerators become faster. One thing to note is that this architecture seems very specifically tuned to the problem of games where CPUs can efficiently simulate the environment and it does not improve the sample efficiency for situations where we can&#x2019;t run lots of simulations.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> It was quite surprising to me that this worked as well as it did: this model requires communication across machines <em>at every timestep of the environment</em>, which intuitively means that latency should be a major bottleneck, while the standard model only requires communication once per batch of trajectories.</p><h2>DEEP LEARNING </h2><p><strong><a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.03384"">AutoML-Zero: Evolving Machine Learning Algorithms From Scratch</a></strong> <em>(Esteban Real, Chen Liang et al)</em> (summarized by Sudhanshu): Most previous work in the area of automated machine learning, or AutoML, has focussed on narrow search spaces that are restricted to specific parts of the machine learning pipeline, e.g. the architecture of a neural network, or the optimizer in meta-learning. These spaces are often so constrained by the hand-engineered components around them that architectures and algorithms discovered, say, by evolutionary search (ES), are only slightly better than random search (RS). This work aims to set up the problem with very weak constraints and a wide search space: a) a machine learning program has three component functions, <em>Setup</em>, <em>Predict</em>, and <em>Learn</em>, which start out empty, and b) are populated by RS or ES with procedural operations from over 50 arithmetic, trigonometric, linear algebra, probability, and pre-calculus operators.</p><p>They demonstrate that with such a vast search space, RS fares very poorly in comparison to ES. They also report that ES finds several procedures that are recognizable as useful for machine learning, such as a simple neural network, gradient descent, gradient normalization, multiplicative interactions, noise augmentation, noisy dropout and learning rate decay.</p><p><strong>Sudhanshu&apos;s opinion:</strong> This work empirically demonstrates that we now have sufficient methods and tricks in our ES toolkit that enable us to evolve machine learning algorithms from scratch. Additionally, this process produces computer code, which itself may yield to theoretical analysis furthering our knowledge of learning algorithms. I think that powerful AI systems of the future may employ such techniques to discover solutions.</p><h1>NEWS </h1><p><strong><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/CMnMaTxNAhXfcEtgm/announcing-web-taisu-may-13-17"">Announcing Web-TAISU, May 13-17</a></strong> <em>(Linda Linsefors)</em> (summarized by Rohin): The <strong><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/events/yuMuDGnJ8omGhMx9y/taisu-technical-ai-safety-unconference"">Technical AI Safety Unconference</a></strong> (<strong><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/392d2043e782/an-57why-we-should-focus-on-robustness-in-ai-safety-and-the-analogous-problems-in-programming"">AN #57</a></strong>) will be held online from May 13-17.</p><h4><strong>FEEDBACK</strong></h4><p>I&apos;m always happy to hear feedback; you can send it to me, <strong><a href=""https://rohinshah.com/"">Rohin Shah</a></strong>, by <strong>replying to this email</strong>.                         </p><h4><strong>PODCAST</strong></h4><p>An audio podcast version of the <strong>Alignment Newsletter</strong> is available.

Gordon Worley sees the difference being that post-rationality is based upon <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5LP6Jc8ztwcyb296X/outline-of-metarationality-or-much-less-than-you-wanted-to"">epistemic circularity</a>, but Eliezer <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/C8nEXTcjZb9oauTCW/where-recursive-justification-hits-bottom"">proposed that too</a>. David Chapman defines it in terms of being <a href=""https://meaningness.com/metablog/stem-fluidity-bridge"">meta-systematic instead of systematic</a>. Dross Bucket seems to focus on the <a href=""https://drossbucket.com/2017/09/30/metarationality-a-messy-introduction/"">limits of formal systems</a>. <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/TvSEg5WzSadC697Gd/post-rationality-and-rationality-a-dialogue"">Agile Caveman</a> characterises post-rationality as being aware of the social dynamics within rationalism and which created rationalism, in particular how rationalism was born out of a conflict with non-rationalist and how their on-going efforts to optimise the world entangles them in conflicts (I haven&apos;t seen this take anywhere else). And Orthonormal described post-rationalists as those who believe that the rationalist attempt to <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/2Ee5DPBxowTTXZ6zf/rationalists-post-rationalists-and-rationalist-adjacents"">systematise all knowledge is misguided</a>. Further post-rationality is often painted as being in opposition to rationality, to the extent that I&apos;ve even heard one post-rationalist describe rationality as a cult.</p><p>The most natural way for me to define rationality and post-rationality is as two clouds in the space of ideas and practice. Since Less Wrong style rationality includes some post-rational elements (<a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7ZqGiPHTpiDMwqMN2/the-twelve-virtues-of-rationality"">nameless virtue</a>, <a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow,_by_Daniel_Kahneman"">system 1 and system 2</a>, ect.), we will define a perspective which we&apos;ll call Archetypal Rationality in order to provide a contrast to Post-Rationality. By comparing to Archetypal Rationality instead of Rationality, we&apos;ll avoid the temptation to misrepresent and oversimplify Rationality to make the contrast more obvious.</p><p>Archetypal rationality is not <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rationalism-empiricism/"">rationalism</a> in philosophy. It focuses upon the power of the human mind, not unassisted, but in combination with empirical evidence. It has faith that <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/KsHmn6iJAEr9bACQW/bayesians-vs-barbarians"">rationality always wins</a>. Proponents likely identify as skeptics, see little value in continental philosophy (or even any kind of <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/FwiPfF8Woe5JrzqEu/philosophy-a-diseased-discipline"">philosophy</a>), and are extremely skeptical of claims like <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/tMhEv28KJYWsu6Wdo/kensh"">Enlightenment</a>. They are likely to make long lists of <a href=""https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/"">fallacies</a> and <a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Bias"">biases</a>, to emphasise logic over emotions, individual reason over tradition and seeks to provide single unified systems. They are likely to prioritise published research over common sense. Advice is likely to consist of a set of rules; do X in situation Y. Discussions of language are likely to focus on producing precise definitions, but attention will also be paid to any obvious connotations.</p><p>In contrast, post-rationality believes that the <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/KsHmn6iJAEr9bACQW/bayesians-vs-barbarians"">barbarians</a> are likely to win. Continental philosophy is seen as often containing insights, even if they aren&apos;t always clearly and precisely articulated. More broadly, it is more acceptable to gesture at a concept <a href=""https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2017/08/17/the-premium-mediocre-life-of-maya-millennial/"">even if you can&apos;t define it precisely</a>. The default assumption is that there is some instrumental value in <a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/16/book-review-seeing-like-a-state/"">traditions</a> and spiritual practises (<a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/fnkbdwckdfHS2H22Q/steelmanning-divination-1"">steelmanning divination</a>).

Frames and ways of being (see <a href=""https://www.iep.utm.edu/virtue/"">virtue ethics</a>) are seen as more important than rules. When discussing definitions, <a href=""https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2017/01/05/tendrils-of-mess-in-our-brains/"">more attention is paid to psychology</a> and there is a much greater focus on <a href=""https://philosophyforchange.wordpress.com/2014/03/11/meaning-is-use-wittgenstein-on-the-limits-of-language/"">meaning as use</a>, as opposed to dictionary definitions.

Post-rationalists lean heavily towards post-rationality, but may also have some elements of archetypal rationality as well.

Post-rationality is open to more ideas, but has a greater risk of going astray.</p><p>There&apos;s often a complication in defining post-rationality where someone says &quot;post-rationality involves X&quot; and then the other person says &quot;X is compatible with rationality too&quot; and then the cycle repeats. Overall, it is hoped that this framing prevents the tendencies of these discussions to end up in with people talking past each other in this manner.</p>",Ouroborus,ouroborus,Ouroborus,

include a bit of the previous message to remind people what they were
talking about:

Some people would be lazy, and just include the whole earlier message,
without any trimming.  This was 

<a href=""https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Mailing_list_etiquette"">widely
viewed</a> 

<a href=""http://www.idallen.com/topposting.html"">as
rude</a>, and there were many ""netiquette"" guides that 

<a href=""https://mailformat.dan.info/quoting/bottom-posting.html"">reminded
people</a> that trimming was polite consideration of your reader.



</p><p>

As time went on, however, mail clients adapted.

They learned how to:

</p>

<ul>

<li><p>Thread messages.  Messages didn't have to stand on their own
anymore because the context was right there for the reader.</p></li>

<li><p>Collapse large quoted sections.  Including the whole parent
message no longer caused trouble.</p></li>

</ul>

We have mostly standardized on a new system, where mail clients
default to including the full earlier message, and where they
hide this quoted section by default.  This means that when someone is
added to a thread in progress, they can look back at earlier sections
if they need to.  If someone would like to reply inline they still
can, but people only do it when needed.



<p>

Mobile has also contributed, where composing inline replies without a
proper keyboard is a lot of work, and people often just want to send a
quick response.

</p>

<p>

I finally switched over in <a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/abandoning-bottom-posting"">2013</a> and I was already a bit
of a hold-out.  Looking through the last 25 replies from other people
that I have in my personal email, 24 were top posted and one was
bottom posted without any trimming.

</p>

<p>

I'm on a non-technical list where some users are trying to convince
everyone else to always bottom-post and trim, and it's a mess.
People don't realize they're top-posting and don't know what they
should be doing differently.  The most common response has been for
people to send each reply to the list as a new message composed from
scratch with no quoting at all, which breaks threading and is a pain
to read.  I think at this point, outside of a few places where there's
a thriving trimmed-replies-only culture, we should admit that
top-posting has won and adapt any remaining workflows to accept it.

It quickly spread through the country and then through the rest of the world, threatening to overwhelm health care systems worldwide. Most nations reacted by shutting down large parts of their economy, closing borders, and mandating different curfew variations. Some countries managed to significantly reduce the effective reproduction number <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""R_{eff}""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">R</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.23em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-texatom"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">e</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.519em; padding-right: 0.06em;"">f</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.519em; padding-right: 0.06em;"">f</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>, which caused exponential decay of their new case numbers, though at great cost to their economy. It is unclear how long these measures can be sustained before adequate supply of the population becomes questionable. [1] Unfortunately, lifting of these measures will return <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""R_{eff}""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">R</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.23em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-texatom"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">e</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.519em; padding-right: 0.06em;"">f</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.519em; padding-right: 0.06em;"">f</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> close to its original value again, leading to renewed exponential growth as long as there is no significant immunity in the population.  </p><p>Several strategies have been proposed to deal with this problem:</p><p><strong>Flattening the curve:</strong> Here the idea is to let the epidemic run its course at reduced speed until enough people have been infected to attain herd immunity. [2] Proponents of this idea hope to fine tune the rate of infection to the capacity of the health care system for critical care and especially ventilation. Since according to current estimates R0 of SARS-CoV-2 is about 3, herd immunity is achieved when about 70% of the population have been infected.  </p><p>This strategy has two problems:  </p><p>1. Sufficient flattening would be extremely difficult to achieve, since even in Germany with its high density of critical care facilities and under very favourable assumptions (all critical care just for CoViD patients, 2% critical care patients, 10 treatment days) <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""R_{eff}""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">R</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.23em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-texatom"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">e</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.519em; padding-right: 0.06em;"">f</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.519em; padding-right: 0.06em;"">f</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> would have to be maintained between 1 and 1.25 for about a year to not overwhelm the healthcare system.

Even if sufficient flattening is achieved, this approach would cause widespread death and disability among the affected population. With the best medical care possible CoViD 19 kills at the very least 0.4% of the infected population [6] and a few % require ventilation to survive [7]. In Germany alone this would result in 230000 dead and about 2 million on ventilation with all the morbidity and disability that follows. Applied to 5.25 billion infected (70% of the world population) this would mean 21 million dead and about 200 million on ventilation in the absolute best case. But since these numbers apply to a situation with critical care for everyone who needs it, which is, as demonstrated above, completely impossible to provide with that many cases most of the people who need ventilation would probably die.  </p><p><strong>Quick vaccination:</strong> Under this strategy, all measures are left in place until a vaccine has been developed and produced in sufficient quantity to vaccinate most of the population.  </p><p>Here the problem is that even in the best case, development and safety testing of a vaccine will take at least 12 to 18 months [8] and it will likely prove to be economically infeasible to leave the current lockdowns in place until next year. So the only possibility would be to forgo all but the most rudimentary safety testing with the hope of having a vaccine available this fall, thereby risking severe adverse reactions in an appreciable fraction of the vaccinated population with somewhat unclear benefit. While the outcome would probably be a lot better than with the &#x201E;Flattening the curve&#x201C; strategy, at least currently it seems no state is willing to risk this.  </p><p><strong>Hammer and Dance:</strong> Here the &#x201E;Hammer&#x201C; of the above described lockdowns is used to drive <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""R_{eff}""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">R</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.23em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-texatom"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">e</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.519em; padding-right: 0.06em;"">f</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.519em; padding-right: 0.06em;"">f</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> below 1 until the number of currently infected falls below a manageable number.

While not relying on vaccination, this strategy shares every problem with &#x201C;Hammer and Dance&#x201D; but is even more demanding regarding the comprehensiveness of the testing and tracking regime and the extensiveness of travel bans needed [9].

Many experts, including the american CDC and the WHO, regard masks in community settings as not effective at all or only marginally effective against other aerosolized viruses such as influenza [12]. They also recommend against their use for self protection in the case of SARS-CoV-2 [13] though some contradictory studies exist [14]. This stands in stark contrast to both the expectation derived from principles of biology and physics and decades of experience in both health care [15] and lab settings [16]. To explore why this difference arises, a closer look at the different types of masks available is necessary.</p><h2>Different kinds of masks</h2><p>There are three different types of masks that could be used for infection control purposes:</p><p>1. Surgical Masks:</p><p>Cloth and surgical masks, which are not designed to form a seal on the face, and thus are unable to filter all the air inhaled by the wearer. While larger droplets on a direct path are stopped by these masks, aerosol particles that move primarily under the influence of air currents can gain access to the wearers airways by entering the gap between face and mask. Depending on the exact material used, small aerosol particles may even penetrate the mask itself [17].</p><p>2. Disposable &#x201C;Filtering Facepiece Particle&#x201D; (FFP) masks:</p><p>Disposable masks, built with a face piecemade from a filtering material which is designed to form a seal on the face of the wearer. These are available in different grades, which differ on both seal quality and filter quality, with the highest quality generally deemed suitable for use against aerosolized and even airborne pathogens [18]. In Europe these grades are FFP1, FFP2 and FFP3 [18].  </p><p>A big problem with these masks is that they need to be fitted to the user by bending wires in the mask and adjusting various straps, which many people, even trained medical personnel, often fail to do properly [19]. Also, not every mask can be fitted to every face and a filtering mask with a compromised seal is no better than a surgical mask since in both cases unfiltered air can enter from the sides. These are the masks almost universally used in health care for protection against infection with SARS-CoV-2.</p><p>Another downside of these masks is that the filtering element &#x2013; the facepiece itself &#x2013; is continuously exposed to the breath of the wearer, which soaks the filter with moisture. In the presence of liquid water it is possible for virus particles bound to filter fibers to become resuspended in this liquid. Since all particle filters used in masks are not membrane filters but adsorption filters with pore sizes much larger than the particles to be removed from the air [18], these resuspended virus particles can diffuse across the filter to the inside of the mask as soon as a continuous water column is formed across the filter material. Now they can either be re-aerosolized by the wearer&apos;s breath or taken up by lip contact to the inside of the mask. This necessitates frequent changing of damp masks. Since it is unclear if these masks can be cleaned and reused without significant drop in filter performance, the continued supply of the health care system with a sufficient number of masks is difficult and supply of the general population for everyday use is a logistical impossibility.   </p><p>3. Reusable masks with replaceable filters</p><p>This category contains masks which consist of a gas impermeable mask body, typically made from silicone or rubber and one or two separate filter cartridges which fit into filter ports in the mask body. These filters are available in the similar qualities as the above disposable masks, called P1, P2 and P3 in Europe [18].</p><p>A properly fitting mask of this type is very easy to use compared to an FFP mask, since no delicate adjustments have to be made. Also fit testing with these masks is very easy since closing the filter ports while wearing the mask makes inhaling impossible if the mask seals properly.</p><p>Another big advantage is that these masks generally have a one way valve protecting the filter from the wearer&apos;s breath, which is discharged via a separate exhaust valve. This prevents the filter material from being soaked by the wearer&apos;s breath and thus prevents the diffusion of virus particles across the filter. Since these filters are generally designed to be worn for a couple of hours in environments with very high dust load (grinding wood or stone, spray painting etc.) these filters should easily last for days, weeks or even months worn in a relatively clean health care or community setting. While this is generally not recommended in the manufacturers guidelines, as long as the filter remains dry it should be quite safe [18]. A common misunderstanding is that full dust filters begin to leak. While this is true for gas filters when their absorption capacity is exhausted, dust filters do not leak, since the free space between internal surfaces available for absorption of particles does not increase but decrease, causing them to clog, i.e. resistance to air passage starts to rise which indicates that replacement is necessary.  </p><h2>Effectiveness of high quality particle filtering masks against SARS-CoV-2 infection  </h2><p>As mentioned above, on the one hand there has been some research on efficiency of different masks against community based dissemination of typical droplet and aerosolized infections like flu, rhino viruses and SARS-CoV-1 with mixed results.  </p><p>On the other hand, there is ample precedent for successful use of well fitted P3 masks even against dry airborne threats like anthrax [20]. The known properties of the SARS-CoV-2 virus suggest that it should be even less likely to penetrate such masks.</p><p>Preliminary evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 becomes nonviable when dried out [21]. This also fits prior expectation since SARS-CoV-2 has a lipoprotein envelope, which should be denatured by desiccation. This means that very fine particles around 2.5 &#xB5;m, which are most likely to penetrate a high quality particle filtering mask, should already be dried out at the point when they might be inhaled under most plausible circumstances. And even these particles are retained to 99,95% in a P3 filter with filtering efficiency steeply rising with larger (or smaller!) particle diameters [18].</p><p>This forms a stark contrast to the mixed results found for mask use against flu transmission in community settings.</p><p>This apparent contradiction is, in the case of FFP masks, easily explained by the general observation that they are often worn in a way that compromises their seal to the wearer&apos;s face even if worn by trained professionals [19]. In the case of surgical masks, their inability to form a seal in the first place makes them incapable to reliably protect against droplets small enough to move with air currents (single to double digit &#xB5;m scale)  [17]. These problems are further exacerbated by compliance issues, especially when people are asked to wear masks in their own household [22]. This makes the whole body of research conducted with surgical and FFP masks in community settings highly suspect if applied to easy to use, preformed, reusable masks with P3 filters.  </p><p>Infection via intact or even damaged skin is highly implausible for SARS-CoV-2 and has never been observed. Food borne spread, while not completely implausible, has not been observed to play an appreciable epidemiological role in SARS-CoV-2 [23]. This leaves direct targeting of the respiratory system via droplet and aerosolized infection and possibly smear infection to mouth and eyes as the only relevant transmission routes. Transmission via both of these should be severely curtailed by the use of a P3 standard equivalent mask. If the mask needs to be worn with spray tight eye protection or not is currently unclear, since it is currently unknown whether or not infection can occur through droplets entering the eye. A plausible mechanism for this exists, since liquids in the eye are evacuated into the nasal cavity via the nasolacrimal duct.  </p><p>Therefore, until more research is conducted with well fitted P3 equivalent masks, we should go on to assume that at least P3 masks, worn properly, with appropriate eye protection while maintaining basic hand hygiene are efficient in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection regardless of setting. The extraordinary evidence required to accept the quite extraordinary claim that a well fitted P3 mask does not prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections in community settings does not exist.</p><h2>A policy proposal for the eradication of SARS-CoV2</h2><p>This is a broad outline of a policy proposal that should be able to eradicate SARS-CoV-2 from a given population within a couple of months to a year while allowing nearly complete economic functioning over much of this period:</p><p>Over the next few months, infection numbers are maintained as envisioned under the conventional &#x201C;Hammer and Dance&#x201D; scenario, while at the same time public funding is used to build up a large scale production capability for 5 to 10 different mask body types to fit most faces, matching P3 equivalent filters and some form of eye protection with the aim to be able to supply most of the population with one properly fitted mask body and 3 to 5 matching P3 filters as well as spray tight eye protection.  </p><p>While this is no trivial matter, it should be well within the capabilities of industrialized and most emerging economies. Prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, consumer prices for a half mask body were about &#x20AC; 30 to &#x20AC; 60, a P3 filter about &#x20AC; 5 to &#x20AC; 10 and protective goggles about &#x20AC; 20, forming an upper bound of &#x20AC; 100 per person with significant room for improvement through economies of scale. This suggests costs which are only a small fraction of the costs already incurred and still to be expected. Since mask bodies, valves and filter casings can be produced by simple injection molding, quick scale up of production capabilities should be possible by retooling of existing production lines.  </p><p>Also the availability of raw materials should be no problem since a broad range of elastomeric polymers are suitable for the production of mask bodies, many of which are used in large quantities for other purposes. For example silicone (medical and industrial applications, gluing and sealing), Polyurethane (industrial and building applications, gluing and insulating) and butyl rubber (tyres and industrial applications).  </p><p>As soon as masks are produced in large numbers they are issued to the population, beginning with health care workers and public facing employees with the directive to wear mask and eye protection whenever people not belonging to their household are (or have recently been) in the same room or within 5 meters.</p><p>This cuts down on wear time and thus reduces filter degradation and wearer exhaustion compared to wearing the mask at all times while outside the home without generating much risk of infection. To avoid possible infection via surfaces, everyone is instructed to carry a small bottle of 80% ethanol to disinfect hands  </p><ul><li>before and after putting on the mask or taking it off</li><li>touching the unmasked face for other reason</li><li>eating</li></ul><p>Ethanol is available in sufficient quantities, since large amounts could be diverted from E5 and E10 fuel production.</p><p>Even though this is not standard practice, for the reasons described above (filters remain dry, thus virus particles bound to the filters will stay there [18] and degrade over time) filters can be used for 2 to 4 weeks unless severe contamination with liquids or large amounts of dust has occurred. After use the mask body can be cleaned with soap and water and disinfected with the same alcoholic solution used as hand rub to maintain hygienic conditions. This greatly alleviates both production and logistic demands and allows to supply most of the population in a comparatively short amount of time.</p><p>Since people following the policies outlined above are much less likely to become infected, they are also much less likely to pass the infection on to other people much in the same way an immunised person no longer acts as a host to the virus. Thus as soon as about 70 % of the population follow this protocol, an &#x201C;artificial herd immunity&#x201D; will be attained and the number of active infections will start to decline even in the absence of additional measures or much earlier if combined with other measures. Thus it is not necessary to provide literally everyone with a mask for this to work. People medically incapable of wearing a mask would also be protected by this effect.</p><p>This regimen could be continued with little economic damage until SARS-CoV-2 is eradicated from the population or a safe vaccine has been developed.</p><h2>Acknowledgements</h2><p>Many thanks to Michael Albert, Simon Fischer, David Gretzschel, Stefan Heimersheim, Ursula Korten-Schmitz, Ulrike Mazalla and Dr. Gerd Schmitz for their valuable input.</p><h2>References</h2><ol><li>Wikipedia &#x201C;2019-2020 Coronavirus Pandemic&#x201D; <u><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019&#x2013;20_coronavirus_pandemic"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019&#x2013;20_coronavirus_pandemic</a></u> 	Retrieved 11.04.2020</li><li>Stevens H. 	&#x201C;Why outbreaks like coronavirus spread exponentially, and how to 	&#x201C;flatten the curve&#x201D; Washington Post <u><a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/"">https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/</a></u> Retrieved 11.04.2020 </li><li>Deutsche Gesellschaft f&#xFC;r Epidemiologie (DGEpi) &#x201C;Stellungnahme der 	Deutschen Gesellschaft f&#xFC;r Epidemiologie (DGEpi) zur Verbreitung 	des neuen Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)&#x201D; <u><a href=""https://www.dgepi.de/assets/Stellungnahmen/Stellungnahme2020Corona_DGEpi-21032020.pdf"">https://www.dgepi.de/assets/Stellungnahmen/Stellungnahme2020Corona_DGEpi-21032020.pdf</a></u> Retrieved 11.04.2020 </li><li>Science Media Center Germany &#x201C;Auslastung der Intensivstationen: Zahlen aus 	Deutschland und Europa&#x201D; 	<u><a href=""	https://www.sciencemediacenter.de/alle-angebote/fact-sheet/details/news/auslastung-der-intensivstationen-zahlen-aus-deutschland-und-europa/"">https://www.sciencemediacenter.de/alle-angebote/fact-sheet/details/news/auslastung-der-intensivstationen-zahlen-aus-deutschland-und-europa/</a></u> 	Retrieved 11.04.2020 </li><li>Bach J. 	&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t &#x201C;Flatten the Curve,&#x201D; squash it!&#x201D; Medium <u><a href=""https://medium.com/@joschabach/flattening-the-curve-is-a-deadly-delusion-eea324fe9727"">https://medium.com/@joschabach/flattening-the-curve-is-a-deadly-delusion-eea324fe9727</a></u> 	Retrieved 11.04.2020 </li><li>Streek, H. et 	al. &#x201C;Vorl&#xE4;ufiges Ergebnis und Schlussfolgerungen der COVID-19 	Case-Cluster-Study (Gemeinde Gangelt)&#x201D; <u><a href=""https://www.land.nrw/sites/default/files/asset/document/zwischenergebnis_covid19_case_study_gangelt_0.pdf"">https://www.land.nrw/sites/default/files/asset/document/zwischenergebnis_covid19_case_study_gangelt_0.pdf</a></u> 	Retrieved 11.04.2020 </li><li>Phua, J. et 	al. &#x201C;Intensive care management of coronavirus disease 2019 	(COVID-19): challenges and recommendations&#x201D; The Lancet 	<u><a href=""	https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(20)30161-2/fulltext"">https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(20)30161-2/fulltext</a></u> Retrieved 11.04.2020 </li><li>Kuznalla, R. 	&#x201C;The timetable for a coronavirus vaccine is 18 months.

Within a span of a long weekend, my older child’s preschool closed down for the day, then for a month, then indefinitely; the governor of my state ordered all restaurants and other gathering spaces closed with barely six hours’ notice; and confirmed COVID-19 cases in my home county ballooned nearly fivefold as testing capacity belatedly ramped up. By the end of that same week, virtually all non-essential businesses had sent their workers home and large swaths of the United States were under mandatory stay-at-home orders with no end date in sight.</p><p>As fast as this all took place, one needs only to check the latest coronavirus statistics to see that, if anything, it didn’t happen fast enough. The prior week, an article by a little-known Silicon Valley data scientist and growth marketer named Tomás Pueyo had gone viral by <a href=""https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-act-today-or-people-will-die-f4d3d9cd99ca"">arguing for the immediate enactment of social distancing measures</a> much like the ones described above. In addition to its bluntness and urgency, Pueyo’s article stood out for its detailed original analysis, including this estimate that delaying social distancing measures by <em>a single day </em>in the exponential growth stage of an uncontrolled pandemic could result in a 40% higher overall caseload:</p><figure><img src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/820/1*WwGNNm9-I2Rjw6kkWHiJOA.png"" /></figure><p>…an estimate that was backed up by empirical data from the original epicenter of the outbreak, Hubei province in China, showing true cases beginning to plummet as soon as officials instituted a lockdown.</p><figure><img src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*qHPJTLZbk71oxoKB.png"" /></figure><p><strong>As social sector leaders, we must remember that behind each change of this nature is a policy decision</strong>. For every state or municipality that implemented (or didn’t) a stay-at-home order, for every office that shut its doors (or didn’t) before it had to, for every event producer that canceled its programming (or didn’t) out of an “abundance of caution,” there was a person or a group of people who considered and made that choice. For several years now, I’ve been arguing to anyone who will listen that <a href=""https://medium.com/@iandavidmoss/decision-making-for-impact-a-guide-9b22df170568"">the decisions of social sector leaders sometimes carry enormous consequences</a>. While choosing whether and when to order a lockdown is a particularly dramatic demonstration of that principle, the decisions facing philanthropists, government agencies, and nonprofits in the days and weeks ahead are similarly fraught with both immense import and great uncertainty.</p><p>So how should we respond? Several clients and colleagues have reached out to me in recent days to ask for help thinking through that question. The <a href=""http://omidyar.com/"">Omidyar Network</a>, a foundation supporting sustainable growth and beneficial technology among other program areas, worked with me to retrofit a previously planned “Learning Hour” for staff to focus on making wise decisions in tumultuous times. And <a href=""https://tpw.org/"">The Philanthropy Workshop</a>, a training and peer learning program for major donors and foundation trustees, hired me on short notice to deliver a presentation on adapting principles of strategic philanthropy to the current crisis. Both organizations have expressed interest in helping a broader audience benefit from the insights we generated.</p><a href=""https://medium.com/media/2d4bc9cbb0ff3ba9d048145ed2f823eb/href"">https://medium.com/media/2d4bc9cbb0ff3ba9d048145ed2f823eb/href</a><p>So I’ve written this article as a guide for all of us in the social sector who are grappling with this moment. Some of us want to do everything we can to stop the spread of the pandemic and minimize the overall harm it will cause. Others of us are more concerned with managing the indirect effects of the crisis on communities or causes we care about. Still others of us are just trying to figure out the role we can and ought to play. All of us, though, can benefit from approaching these challenges with thoughtfulness and rigor.</p><p>As we’ll see, the right moves for your situation depend greatly on your goals, values, and unique circumstances. So rather than one-size-fits-all advice, my goal in this piece is to offer a set of tools and thinking guides to help you figure out what the right path looks like for you and your team. And if you need more help, feel free to <a href=""https://www.iandavidmoss.com/contact"">reach out to me</a> — I’m happy to chat.</p><p>With that all said, let’s dive in to some questions that I know many of us are sitting with right now.</p><h3>Should I shift — or divert resources from — my mission to address COVID-19?</h3><p>Before we get too far into this, let’s be clear about for whom this is <em>not</em> a complicated question. There are plenty of individual donors out there who are in the fortunate position of having more money earmarked for charitable purposes than they have previously known what to do with. In recent years, <a href=""https://www.nptrust.org/reports/daf-report/"">donations to donor-advised funds (or DAFs) have grown tremendously</a>, with many donors attracted to the promise of not having to decide immediately how the money is distributed. And there are others, <a href=""https://twitter.com/jack/status/1247616214769086465"">like Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey</a>, who were planning to ramp up their philanthropy at some point soon but just hadn’t gotten around to it yet. Donors like these have a lot more flexibility to respond to the current crisis because they don’t have existing obligations to maintain. It doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s the right thing to do in every case — a donor who had planned to give every last dollar to fight climate change might still want to stick to that plan, for example — but because they have the option to respond directly, they should probably take advantage of it unless they have a good reason not to.</p><p>On the other side of the spectrum, we have lots of organizations and government agencies with very clear founding missions that will never change. They certainly may need to adapt their strategies and practices to acknowledge the new realities that COVID-19 is visiting upon us, but the mission is the mission. The Smallville Property Tax Assessor’s Office isn’t going to suddenly turn into some sort of global coronavirus SWAT team.</p><p>For the rest of us, the answer is a whole lot less clear. Let’s say you run an arts organization whose season just got canceled, but you’re sitting on an empty facility. Should you try to find a way to repurpose it? Or let’s say you’re a trustee at a family foundation that funds a mishmash of program areas — should you encourage your fellow directors to start or buy into a COVID-19 response fund?</p><p>This is a tough one, but in general when considering this question I think it’s helpful to think about balancing <strong>scope of impact</strong> vs. <strong>burden of care</strong>. When my family and I found ourselves facing the prospect of self-quarantining for months together with no relief in sight, there was a period of several days during which I intensely questioned how I should be spending my time. Even as I felt a strong sense of urgency to use my skills to help the world, my responsibilities toward my young children made any kind of meaningful engagement seem next to impossible. Part of me felt deeply selfish for prioritizing the wellbeing of my kids, already so privileged compared to most of the world’s children, so highly. But I also realized that the world’s children have many caretakers besides me, whereas my own had no one but me and my wife to depend on. As much as I believed I could be helpful in this moment, I had to be careful not to let a fantasy of playing hero cause me to neglect those who need me most.</p><p>This is a story about a family, but I think the same principle applies to donors and organizations. If you have constituents, communities, or causes depending on you, you need to be really careful about abandoning them in a time of crisis. I’m not saying don’t ever do it, but there ought to be a damn good reason. Keeping that principle in mind, then, the two examples I floated above look a bit different. The family foundation is probably best positioned to take care of its current grantees in whatever way makes the most sense — adapting its approach as needed to address new barriers that its beneficiaries are facing, of course, but not fundamentally shifting focus unless the focus needs to be shifted anyway. The arts organization, by contrast, has a facility that is sitting unused. Seeking to activate the space temporarily for public health purposes, e.g. to serve as an overflow space for triaging patients or providing childcare to essential workers, does not have to come at the cost of neglecting the organization’s core mission. So if there is an opportunity to pursue it, why not?</p><h3>Should I spend more than I usually do?</h3><p>A related question is how much we should change our spending patterns in response to the crisis, whether that means dipping into endowments or donation budgets, incurring unplanned deficits in the course of responding to immediate needs, or capturing cost savings wherever you can. Again, many individuals and organizations don’t have much of a choice on this one — if the bulk of your revenue has suddenly disappeared and you didn’t have much of a cushion to fall back on, then of course you’ll be cutting back expenditures. But those in a more comfortable position, including a lot of donors and foundations, as well as government entities that are in a position to take on additional debt, need to decide if this is a moment to double down or to hold back.</p><p>I don’t think the answer here is at all obvious, and I can think of a number of reasons why you might land on one side or the other. One of the best arguments for spending more today, of course, is that the needs created by both the pandemic itself and the economic and political disruptions associated with it are very real, and it’s not yet clear that society is up to the challenge of fixing things without additional intervention. In times of deep uncertainty and volatility, moreover, it’s wise to deploy spare capital (whether financial, reputational, time, etc.) to hedge against the potential worst-case scenarios.</p><p>On the other hand, it’s worth remembering that the <em>most likely</em> outcome is that the public health portion of this crisis will be largely over within two years once a vaccine is developed and/or herd immunity is reached among the population. If you’re coming out of that two-year period having contributed marginally to the victory against COVID-19 but with greatly reduced capacity to make a difference in anything else going forward, is that a good trade? The answer, of course, will depend a lot on the proximity between the current crisis and your mission. A funder focused on, say, reducing the threat of nuclear war would be on solid ground in deciding to save its chips for another day. But a social justice advocacy organization might conclude that the threats to vulnerable populations and the policy responses on the table are momentous enough in the present that it’s worth a gamble to get them right.</p><p>Either way, you’ll want to ensure that the path you choose here ultimately supports your <em>long-term</em> goals, not just the perceived need of the moment. It may be that longer-term goals can’t be achieved without decisive action now. But that’s a question you’ll want to consider very carefully given that next year we could very well be in a world with similarly daunting needs but greatly depleted resources.</p><h3>How do I deal with all the uncertainty?</h3><p>While there seem to be indications that the curve of cases and hospitalizations is starting to flatten overall, there is still so much we don’t know. We don’t know when it will be safe to open up schools, offices, and restaurants again, even in a limited way. We don’t know how long supply chains will hold up in the meantime. We don’t know how long it will take to discover and distribute a vaccine, or if it will happen at all. We don’t know how long people stay immune once they’ve contracted the virus. We don’t know what, if any, long-term impacts from infection may be awaiting those who recovered. We don’t know what the future looks like for the travel industry, large event promoters, or other parts of the economy most affected by the pandemic. We don’t know if case counts and other statistics bear any semblance to reality in many of the most populous countries in the world.</p><p>We are truly living in <a href=""https://medium.com/@dalgoso/welcome-to-peak-uncertainty-population-you-and-your-team-7e05fc729493"">peak uncertainty</a>, and it’s completely understandable to feel overwhelmed and powerless when trying to make decisions in such circumstances. But as hard as it may be to believe, there are ways to make sense of an environment like this. It turns out that I spent much of last year working on a project with Democracy Fund to develop <a href=""https://www.democracyfund.org/blog/entry/im-risk-averse-but-that-doesnt-mean-i-have-to-like-it"">principles for making smart decisions in complex and risky environments</a>. As part of that work, we considered what it means to make decisions — which fundamentally involve predictions about what will happen as a result of your decision — when intervening in complex systems, which are <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system#Nonlinearity"">notoriously hard to predict</a>. That inquiry led us to the recognition that not all complex systems are created equal. Some, despite their complexity, will nevertheless respond well to effective interventions because a) we understand the system well enough to know what interventions applied to which levers are most likely to lead to the results we want, and b) the system doesn’t tend to change all that much. When either or both of those conditions is missing, however, finding effective interventions becomes much more difficult, necessitating different kinds of strategies to achieve the desired outcomes (or avoid undesired ones). You can see this thinking summarized in the graph below:</p><figure><img src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/719/1*6nRue2O4zMO9xr8aiwUkxQ.png"" /><figcaption>Created by Ian David Moss for Democracy Fund, 2019</figcaption></figure><p>So which approach does the present situation call for? I’d argue for taking the <strong>Responsive Approach </strong>with respect to <em>global</em> events. My reasoning is that despite all the important unknowns I listed at the top of this section, it’s still the case that we’re operating in an information-rich environment when it comes to understanding the coronavirus: scientists are generating research at a breathtaking rate, there is wall-to-wall media coverage of the crisis, and we are rapidly gaining experience with the virus that will serve us well in the future. We even now have <a href=""https://twitter.com/iandavidmoss/status/1204112117881806849"">prediction tournaments</a> that generate useful data on relevant questions like what the unemployment rate will be next month and <a href=""https://www.gjopen.com/questions/1561-when-will-an-nba-game-next-be-played"">when the next NBA game will be played</a>. It’s fair to assume that once there is something relevant to know, it won’t be long before we find out.</p><figure><img src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*LygPBxVl47w0w700eNaRcg.png"" /><figcaption>Example of a prediction tournament question at <a href=""https://www.metaculus.com/questions/3860/when-will-a-vaccine-targeted-at-the-2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-be-administered-to-at-least-10m-people/"">Metaculus</a></figcaption></figure><p>In the meantime, we can best deal with the global uncertainty by prioritizing the <strong>worst-case scenarios</strong> — i.e., what happens if COVID is with us for a long time with no vaccine in sight? What happens if we start to experience widespread shortages of food and other supplies? — and anticipating how those scenarios would affect you and your constituents. Consider what steps you could take now to mitigate the impacts of those worst-case scenarios, either by making them less likely, or less bad if they come to pass. On the other end of the spectrum, we can also think about if there are any amazing opportunities hidden in the crisis — for example, things are looking <a href=""https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2020/04/pollution-made-the-pandemic-worse-but-lockdowns-clean-the-sky/"">unexpectedly good right now for environmentalists</a> — and plot how to take advantage of them over the longer term.</p><p>Meanwhile, the <strong>Ecological Approach</strong> is likely to be a better fit with respect to your immediate context. Unlike with the progression of the virus generally, we don’t have as much information about how things are playing out in certain parts of the world or what the indirect effects are on specific cause areas, industries, or segments of the population that may be relevant to your mission. And it’s quite possible that we won’t know some of those effects for a long time. The ecological approach is all about planning for as many scenarios as possible in the face of uncertainty by building into the environment around you flexible capacity to respond to whatever might come. In practice, that means choosing near-term actions that apply to a <em>range of outcomes </em>wherever possible, so that your bases are covered regardless of which underlying model of the current reality turns out to be correct. Think of this as akin to stocking up on supplies at home — you probably don’t know yet what you’re going to want for dinner two weeks from now, but you can try to buy ingredients today that will give you as wide a range of options as possible. It also means listening to your partners and constituents most directly affected by the situation, as it’s likely they will have better ideas than you do about what would help the most.</p><p>As you continue to flesh out the details of your plan, you’ll also want to keep in mind how your issue areas, constituents, and local environments are interacting with broader system dynamics. For example, the federal government in the United States just passed the largest bailout in the country’s history, and while there are problems being reported with getting that money out the door, it’s worth asking how those resources will change circumstances for the people and organizations you work with — and which of them might have more difficulty accessing that support.</p><p>Finally, with so much unknown, don’t be afraid to try approaches that are a little “weird.” As long as you can make a coherent argument for them and you are staying within the boundaries of the law and basic ethics, it’s a good thing to have a broad range of diverse strategies out there in the ecosystem in case one of them turns out to be wildly successful.</p><h3>How will I know if I made a difference?</h3><p>One of the trickiest questions that institutions are asking themselves right now is how to adapt monitoring and evaluation approaches to a situation that seems so inhospitable to them. Are these activities even relevant in a time like this? How do you collect data respectfully and responsibly when everyone understandably feels like they have more important things to worry about? Does suspending or soft-pedaling monitoring and compliance activities mean shirking our commitment to accountability?</p><p>Before we get into the details on this, I think it’s important to frame the conversation in the context of what we already know about evidence, which is that <a href=""https://medium.com/datagonist/the-crisis-of-evidence-use-234d0c63e7c2"">even in “normal” times, it’s badly underused</a>. Two separate studies, for example, have shown that nearly three-quarters of foundation professionals have a hard time getting their own colleagues to pay attention to the research they commission. If a lot of research and evaluation could justifiably be described as a waste of time and money a year ago, you want to be especially careful not to fall into that trap now.</p><p>The best way to ensure that you’re being responsible about evaluation is to ask what you’ll realistically do with the information once you have it. <strong>If your only motivation to conduct or request an evaluation is to be able to reassure yourself that you made a difference, don’t bother. </strong>Present circumstances are so complex and fast-changing that it’s going to be next to impossible to isolate the impact that you and/or your organization had. Not to mention that so much is out of your control that you could respond to the situation brilliantly and still not get the results you want, and vice versa.</p><p>Now, with that being said, in some circumstances there will be other uses for the information that might be gained through an evaluation. One obvious case is where the strategy relies on new information to be effective. If you’re operating a rapid response to the crisis and unsure about the assumptions that are underlying your program design, then yes, please test them as soon and as robustly as possible to ensure you’re not placing all your eggs in the wrong basket. Even in these situations, however, you should check to make sure there aren’t other options available to meet your information needs — perhaps research that is already being done on similar interventions in other places, for example — before committing scarce resources to monitoring and data collection. After all, <a href=""https://medium.com/@iandavidmoss/weve-been-thinking-about-measurement-all-wrong-e3b51c46a792"">the best evidence can do is to<em> reduce</em> your uncertainty about the factors that matter to a decision</a>; investing in more information won’t free you from making educated guesses and judgment calls.</p><p>After this is all done, though, <strong>if you have to evaluate something, I recommend evaluating your <em>process </em>instead. </strong>Did you put in time to brainstorm a range of creative options, more than might have initially felt comfortable? Did you consider how those options might play out under different plausible scenarios? Did you think about what additional information would be relevant to your decision and seek it out to the extent possible? Did you act decisively once it was clear that the cost of waiting for greater certainty wouldn’t be worth the increased confidence? The project I mentioned earlier with Democracy Fund <a href=""https://www.slideshare.net/createquity/seven-principles-of-good-decisionmaking-in-comple-x-x"">yielded a rubric for evaluating a decision-making process</a> on criteria like these, which you’re welcome to steal for your own purposes.</p><h3>What can I do to help right now?</h3><p>Several weeks ago, I decided that the best way for me to contribute in this moment would be to keep track of promising donation opportunities to address the COVID-19 crisis directly. I’ve been doing so <a href=""https://twitter.com/iandavidmoss/status/1241071528768352256"">on Twitter</a>, and will be updating that list on an ongoing basis.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href=""https://twitter.com/iandavidmoss/status/1241071528768352256"">@iandavidmoss</a></p></blockquote><p>Here, though, I want to share with you a more complete snapshot of my current thinking on this, which is informed by a fair amount of reading from diverse sources, conversations with a group of donors actively investigating giving opportunities, and application of the insights mentioned earlier in this piece. With that said, there are plenty of big question marks in the below and I would not be surprised if my opinions changed substantially in the coming weeks as new information comes to light. If that happens, I’ll be sure to update the piece accordingly.</p><p><strong>Premise #1: Speed is of the essence. </strong>Just four months ago, no one had heard of COVID-19; in that time, it has killed more than 100,000 people, destroyed trillions of dollars in economic value, and reshaped the lives of nearly everyone on the planet. Four months is how long some grantmakers take to get a check out the door. To respond effectively, we need new ways of working that eliminate bottlenecks that slow us down. One of the most serious such bottlenecks is the process for obtaining funding for critical research related to the disease and our response. Fortunately, a group of tech entrepreneurs and venture capital funders including Patrick Collison, Paul Graham, and others have launched <a href=""https://fastgrants.org/""><strong>Fast Grants</strong></a>, a bold initiative to turn around funding decisions on COVID-19-related research projects within 48 hours. As of April 12, Fast Grants is accepting additional donations of $10,000 or more and has received far more high-quality applications than available funds can currently support, so this seems like a highly worthwhile donation target.</p><p><strong>Premise #2: COVID-19 is rapidly turning into a poor person’s disease. </strong>It didn’t start out that way, as some of the first cases in the Western world included business executives, celebrities, and politicians. But as suppression measures have gone into effect, the wealthy have found themselves with <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/05/opinions/coronavirus-wealthy-false-security-vicky-ward-opinion/index.html"">much more wherewithal than others</a> to escape the cascading wave of cases around the world. With few exceptions, nearly any vulnerable population you can think of — <a href=""https://www.fox2detroit.com/news/coronavirus-quarantine-is-becoming-catastrophic-for-undocumented-immigrants"">immigrants</a>, <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/01/upshot/coronavirus-sick-days-service-workers.html"">service workers</a>, the <a href=""https://www.statnews.com/2020/04/11/coronavirus-san-francisco-homeless-doctors-difficult-choices/"">homeless</a>, the <a href=""https://publicintegrity.org/health/coronavirus-and-inequality/state-policies-may-send-people-with-disabilities-to-the-back-of-the-line-for-ventilators/"">disabled</a>, <a href=""https://time.com/5819859/us-nursing-home-deaths/"">nursing home residents</a>, <a href=""https://www.wired.com/story/coronavirus-covid-19-jails-prisons/"">incarcerated people</a> — is especially vulnerable to getting sick and dying from this disease. And as bad as it is proving to be for poor people in the United States and other rich countries, I fear it will be <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/opinion/coronavirus-cases.html"">exponentially worse for the vastly greater numbers of poor people in the developing world</a>. Many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) lack infrastructure to accommodate a surge in hospitalizations, and face a steep uphill battle when competing with rich countries for access to scarce resources like personal protective equipment. Even basic necessities like soap and clean running water are hardly a given across much of the world. Moreover, for populations packed into dense slums who struggle to survive every day, adopting social distancing may simply mean risking death by starvation instead of infection.</p><p>The group of interested donors that I mentioned earlier is still investigating the best ways to help here, but two prospects currently stand out. First, the <a href=""https://covid19responsefund.org/faq""><strong>World Health Organization’s COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund</strong></a> is seeking to raise $1 billion by the end of April to fully implement a <a href=""https://www.who.int/publications-detail/strategic-preparedness-and-response-plan-for-the-new-coronavirus"">pre-existing pandemic preparedness plan</a> that prioritizes building up public health infrastructure in the world’s poorest countries. Despite having the backing of governments and corporations around the world, a large funding gap remains. Second, <a href=""https://www.givedirectly.org/covid-19/""><strong>GiveDirectly</strong></a>, which has a strong track record of deploying unconditional cash transfers to people in the developing world, has launched a COVID-specific emergency relief program targeting food stamp recipients in the United States, with plans for international expansion to be finalized soon. Giving people cash has been shown to be a <a href=""https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/cash-transfers"">highly cost-effective intervention</a>, and with severe economic disruptions already taking place and likely to worsen in the coming months, this is a way to spread the wealth.</p><p>In addition to the two organizations listed above, many of the major international aid organizations, including <a href=""https://www.pih.org/article/pihs-emergency-coronavirus-response"">Partners in Health</a>, <a href=""https://www.msf.org/covid-19-depth"">Doctors Without Borders</a>, and <a href=""https://my.care.org/site/Donation2?26793.donation=form1&amp;df_id=26793&amp;mfc_pref=T&amp;_ga=2.216698335.834191659.1585063610-805108242.1585063610"">CARE</a>, have set up COVID-19-specific funds. I have not vetted these in depth but I encourage you to investigate them for yourself if interested.</p><p><strong>Premise #3: The clearest way out of this crisis is a vaccine that works. </strong>We’ve been hearing for months that vaccines are the answer. Incredibly, though, even with trillions of dollars flying around in response to the crisis, there is still such an urgent funding gap that the United Kingdom’s largest private foundation, the Wellcome Trust, has <a href=""https://www.ft.com/content/d0b36718-797a-487a-add6-8308ce339fc1"">launched a fundraising campaign</a> to help fill it. Among the priorities identified is $2 billion to fund the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_for_Epidemic_Preparedness_Innovations""><strong>Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Interventions (CEPI)</strong></a>, which helps vaccine trials get off the ground faster (<a href=""https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-clinical-trial-investigational-vaccine-covid-19-begins"">one has already proceeded to phase 1 trial</a>) and ensure equitable distribution once an effective vaccine has been identified. Despite the daunting $2 billion figure, CEPI has already raised more than a third of the necessary funds and <a href=""https://cepi.net/news_cepi/2-billion-required-to-develop-a-vaccine-against-the-covid-19-virus-2/"">needs less than $200 million to meet its needs through June</a> according to my calculations. If you don’t have that kind of money to play with, another way to help is to <strong>advocate that your government support CEPI</strong>. In the United States, CEPI is being considered for inclusion in the next stimulus package; you can facilitate this by calling your local representative and/or Speaker Pelosi to request that $1 billion be allocated to CEPI “for US global leadership on vaccines.”</p><h3>Final thoughts</h3><p>All of us are feeling our way through this new reality. In the coming weeks and months we may learn new things that have dramatic implications for some of the advice above. But the best that anyone can expect is that we make the wisest choices we can with the information we have available to us at the time, and that’s what I’ve tried to do here. I’d love to know if you find any of this useful and how you are putting it into practice.</p><p>In the meantime, stay safe and take care of yourself to the extent you can, and don’t forget that we’re all in this together.</p><img src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=512162f40f23"" />",Ian David Moss,ian-david-moss,Ian David Moss,

In particular, evidence that it is not carcinogenic exists for only one of two mechanisms for ultraviolet carcinogenicity.  In addition, use of far-ultraviolet light in public spaces to prevent the spread of SARS-COV-2 or other pathogens leads to a host of other concerns that need to be addressed.</p><h1>Introduction</h1><p>In 2017, <em>Nature</em> published a <u><a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-21058-w.pdf"">paper</a></u> that investigated the possibility of using far-UVC light to combat a future influenza pandemic.  The paper went mostly unnoticed by non-academics, as is the norm for technical journals, but now with the novel coronavirus and the first pandemic of its kind in 100 years, the public at large is paying attention to ideas from the frontiers and fringes of biology and medicine.  Last month, far-UVC&#x2019;s safe germicidal potential was the subject of a <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/L8KGSDchPpNo48PCM/ubiquitous-far-ultraviolet-light-could-control-the-spread-of"">post</a></u> by Roko Mijic and Alexey Turchin on <em>LessWrong</em>.  They call the use of far UVC in public spaces  &#x201C;one of the most promising and neglected ideas for combating the spread of covid-19,&#x201D; and lament &#x201C;Why hasn&#x2019;t this already been considered by relevant authorities? Far-UVC appears in a literature review by WHO, but it is not currently being acted upon as the amount of evidence in favor of safety and efficacy is small.&#x201D;</p><p>I&#x2019;ve spent the last few weeks educating myself on the literature surrounding far-UVC&#x2019;s safety, and I&#x2019;ve come to a clear conclusion.  Is the use of far-UVC to combat pandemics in general a good idea?  Yes.  Should research on it be expanded?  Yes.  But using far-UVC in public spaces to combat COVID-19 would be way way way premature.</p><p>First, a couple of disclaimers:</p><p><strong>Disclaimer 1: </strong>I am not a biologist or a doctor.  I don&#x2019;t have anything near a professional&#x2019;s expertise on human biological questions.  There may be inaccuracies or misunderstandings throughout this post, although of course I&#x2019;ve done my best.</p><p><strong>Disclaimer 2: </strong>My method for research tends to be browsing Wikipedia to find general information, and using Wikipedia&#x2019;s citations and external links to find more rigorous discussion of specific information.  I try to be wary of Wikipedia&#x2019;s shortcomings&#x2014;I read talk pages and check citations&#x2014;but even so, bias and inaccuracy on Wikipedia will inevitably seep into my perspective.  I&#x2019;ll leave it up to the reader to decide exactly how this research method affects my credibility.</p><h2>Basic Biophysical Argument for Safety and Efficacy</h2><p>Ultraviolet (UV) light is electromagnetic radiation that is shorter wavelength (higher energy) than visible light and longer wavelength than X-rays.  The UV light that can be found on Earth is broken into three subcategories: UVA, closest to visible, (315-380 nm), UVB (315&#x2013;280 nm), and UVC (280-200 nm).  Although the sun emits light in all three UV categories, as well as visible and infrared (IR), not all the light reaches us on the surface.  UVC is absorbed by the ozone layer, and the only UVC light we experience comes from artificial sources.</p><p><figure><img src=""https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/cgtL913iJUZ1xO0b1rVCrKs6Pbbgw_GJnsDfl4DNEmAR5jl--x_69SLWzX0uX4mxYHFJkyghSzeODb0XG2xBqYap2xnmzThgogqT_t9PRZRewXH8kgpm3cVsUD7CMWfn34ur4iu9"" class=""draft-image "" style=""width:624%""></figure></p><p>UVC light has been used as a <u><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet_germicidal_irradiation"">germicide</a></u> since the mid-20th century, but not in public spaces.  Nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) <u><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3292282/"">strongly absorb</a></u> UVC light, which means that when UVC light enters a cell, photons will hit genetic material, damaging or destroying it.  This makes UVC light a strong germicide, but it also means that it is highly carcinogenic, cataractogenic, and toxic to human cells.   Accordingly, its use as a germicide is relegated solely to environments like water sanitation systems where humans won&#x2019;t be exposed.</p><p>However, there is still hope that UVC could be used safely in human environments in the future.  There is some evidence that a certain band of UVC light, &#x201C;far-UVC&#x201D; (200-220 nm) is safe for humans while remaining toxic to pathogens.  </p><p>The basic biophysical argument for why far-UVC might be safe hinges on the fact that mammals are much bigger than bacteria and viruses.  This band of UVC light is absorbed by proteins, as shown in the following figure from one of the first <u><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3797730/"">papers</a></u> to formulate the idea. </p><p><figure><img src=""https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/LgxUdz_hJ7Cd_Hbg_Fck7e6Oh4oGojvApUMiqaeBe_JZTTTaNcLo3KBJAQETmPw_D_1Khaa9hfG-Cww299x4CVoigGLvBQX9MkKSwEi8XPpeirpuopO6NLPbCoeK8ve3BC-vugz5"" class=""draft-image "" style=""width:343%""></figure></p><p>Figure: &#x201C;Mean wavelength-dependent UV absorbance coefficients, averaged over published measurements for eight common proteins&#x201D;</p><p>In essence, protein can block far-UVC light so that it does not reach DNA.   Mammalian cells tend to be 10-25 &#x3BC;m in diameter, while bacteria tend to be 1 &#x3BC;m and viruses even smaller.  Because of this size difference, far-UVC light has to pass through more protein before it gets to a mammalian nucleus, and accordly it should be much weaker by the time it hits mammalian DNA.  In addition, on most parts of the body, we are protected by an outer keratin-rich (keratin is a protein) layer 10-40 &#x3BC;m thick called the <u><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratum_corneum"">stratum corneum</a></u>.  Cells in the stratum corneum are somewhere philosophically between dead and alive&#x2014;they maintain homeostasis and complex intercellular environments, but they lack DNA, so they are safe from cancer.  Because it passes first through the protein-rich stratum corneum, far-UVC light should be greatly attenuated before it even reaches the cell membranes of vulnerable cells.</p><p>Of course, if we&#x2019;re going to be using far-UVC light around humans, we need more than just a biophysical argument.  We also need empirical evidence.  So what does the empirical evidence suggest about safety?  The <em>Nature</em> article cites three studies that experimented with far-UVC light on human cells, on lab grown human skin, and on live mice.  These studies show promise for far-UVC as a safe germicide, but they&#x2019;re far from fully establishing safety.  </p><h1>Safety Concerns for Individuals</h1><p>What happens to a person who has been repeatedly irradiated by far-UVC light?  What are the health risks?  What do we know?  What don&#x2019;t we know?</p><h2>Cancer</h2><p>UV light is famously carcinogenic, so cancer is a central concern when it comes to assessing far-UVC&#x2019;s safety.   Accordingly, the three safety papers mainly seek to assess cancer risk. Of course, cancer can be slow to develop, so it isn&#x2019;t possible to irradiate test subjects and count cancer cases within a reasonable timeframe.  Instead, cancer must be indirectly assessed.</p><p>Cancer is caused by genetic mutations&#x2014;we&#x2019;re as certain about that as we are about anything in human biology&#x2014;so by measuring DNA damage you can get some sort of measure of carcinogenicity.</p><p>So that&#x2019;s what the authors did.  They measured DNA damage under 207 nm light in lab grown human skin <em><u><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3797730/"">in vitro</a></u></em>, under 207 nm light in mice <em><u><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4898708/"">in vivo</a></u></em>, and <u><a href=""https://www.rrjournal.org/doi/pdf/10.1667/RR0010CC.1"">expanded</a></u> their results to 222 nm light on both human skin and mice.  Their results were certainly promising, but the work is far from sufficient for fully demonstrating cancer safety.</p><p>There are two separate mechanisms for DNA damage from UV light, and the safety studies really only address one of the two mechanisms.  We&#x2019;ll discuss them separately:</p><h3>Direct DNA damage</h3><p>Direct DNA damage occurs when photons are absorbed by DNA.  The excited DNA breaks the bonds between the nucleotide bases, and the bonds can reform with adjacent bases instead of opposite bases, disrupting the double helix structure in a type of lesion called a <u><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrimidine_dimer"">pyrimidine dimer</a></u>.</p><p><figure><img src=""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/xwWwKWAeQ7ssNQyKgXSSQxvWhS0iNKEyJqREW_RdC-wz2mcK-1fLUMw-hIbYFjtyvU9FqRKL6rPwdTxF1r4HuIg4xHm5h3dFZykYvFxqqkOEuCvAY99BlOuVecn3QnSVeVnokgye"" class=""draft-image "" style=""width:364%""></figure></p><p>UVB and UVC light can both interact directly with DNA in this way.  This is the mechanism for UVC&#x2019;s germicidal action, but at lower intensities, instead of lethal DNA destruction, lesions can turn into mutations.  The body reacts to this kind of damage by killing and shedding damaged skin cells in the form of sunburn.  </p><p>I feel pretty confident that this kind of damage does not happen in mammalian skin from far-UVC light.  First, the basic biophysical argument is strong.  Few photons should reach the nucleus (and number of photons should basically determine number of lesions).  The light needs to pass through the keratin-rich (and therefore far-UVC absorbing) stratum corneum before even reaching the relevant parts of the epidermis.</p><p>The empirical evidence is also compelling.   Experimentally, <em><u><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3797730/"">in vitro</a></u></em>, as expected, irradiating lab-grown human skin with standard germicidal UVC light caused a huge number of pyrimidine dimers&#x2014;standard germicidal UVC light is highly carcinogenic.  Irradiating the human skin model with far-UVC, however, caused no statistically significant increase in these types of DNA lesions:</p><p><figure><img src=""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-SrBm2hIAKjFaY9I4DAi5occnYidPlgqr5e53aebNSORTr0_-zCp9VkufqOLThj3acJG4uTAoioT6-VyOILX368CzHbk38tzyCiieNO3DFxnYrbnQiblEQzfAkkZpA_3Nfd3Nltx"" class=""draft-image "" style=""width:624%""></figure></p><p>Figure: Induced yield of two types of pyrimidine dimers, from fluences of standard germicidal UVC and from far-UVC light.</p><p>Additionally, <u><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4898708/"">in live mice</a></u>, there was no evidence of sunburn in mice exposed to far-UVC&#x2014;suggesting that direct DNA damage must be minimal.  The skin of unirradiated mice and the skin of mice irradiated with far-UVC looked the same, while in mice irradiated with standard germicidal UVC, the skin was visibly altered and had a thickened epidermis. </p><p><figure><img src=""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/mftvAWwC-aUhm7RV3nP17jKya3GBtwDaVLwJVHio-8mWIJPb30rmEAfCgaFEALEdEQjP9_Gq6sgUHmsSSxPRSgYumI45-mmV7HG0R9me9ZrowmcT6fAUQILoopPrkZAq3Y7EPSqX"" class=""draft-image "" style=""width:624%""></figure></p><p>Figure: A.) Representative cross-sectional images of mouse skin.  B.) Average epidermal thickness for non-irradiated mice, mice under standard germicidal UVC, and mice under 207 nm UVC.</p><h3>Indirect DNA damage</h3><p>Indirect DNA damage occurs when photons are absorbed by other molecules in the cell, and these molecules react to form free radicals and other reactive species, which in turn react with (other molecules which react with other molecules &#x2026; which react with) DNA, causing mutations via an oxidative stress mechanism.  UVA, UVB, and UVC light can all cause indirect DNA damage.  This kind of damage causes skin cancer, but importantly it does not activate the same defenses as direct DNA damage&#x2014;no sunburn.</p><p>The biophysical reasoning that suggests that far-UVC doesn&#x2019;t cause direct DNA damage doesn&#x2019;t apply neatly for indirect damage:  Far-UVC is quickly attenuated in the outer layer of the skin, but how far can reactive chemical species formed near the surface propagate?  Could they make their way down to vulnerable cells in the epidermis?  As far as I can tell, the answer to this question is unknown.  Indirect DNA damage is only relatively recently understood, <u><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6893247"">completely unrecognized</a></u> in 1980 and remaining somewhat controversial up through the early 2000&#x2019;s&#x2014;it wasn&#x2019;t until <u><a href=""https://www.webmd.com/beauty/news/20090728/who-tanning-beds-cause-cancer#1"">2009</a></u> that the WHO recognized tanning beds as a definite cancer risk&#x2014;so there&#x2019;s still a lot of uncertainty.  What is known is that in general, chemicals can diffuse through the skin, and some of the chemical species we&#x2019;re worried about are <u><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4310837/#!po=6.92308"">stable</a></u> in the body.  More research is needed to rule out this possibility.</p><p>In addition, the empirical evidence for far-UVC&#x2019;s safety from direct DNA damage does not apply to indirect DNA damage.  The mouse&#x2019;s lack of sunburn in the <em>in vivo</em> study is meaningless as indirect DNA damage does not cause sunburn.  The lesions they look for, pyrimidine dimers, are specific to direct interactions between photons and DNA.  Indirect DNA damage causes different lesions.</p><h3>Cancer Safety Conclusion</h3><p>Although the results are promising, cancer safety has not been fully established.   Direct DNA damage is minimal, but indirect DNA damage is a huge open question.  </p><h2>Non-cancer cell damage</h2><p>Another potential point for concern is non-cancer cell death.  The <u><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3797730/#pone.0076968-Kochevar2""><em>in vitro</em> study</a></u> found that significant fluences of 207 nm light kill 80% of exposed human fibroplasts (dermis cells):</p><p><figure><img src=""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ziUJDf-emE4yvoDZEg8RQ56mOovczsXpPISvTdStjgcCxtvqnV7sz2ofbz8ICmQW4gFGW4R2MgkRLTGkg98sP5_jD7_iFzVkK0-aiNd45BtGJKLpSSIcjEujFiY0dsi0bS54203G"" class=""draft-image "" style=""width:417%""></figure></p><p>Is this concerning?  <a href=""https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/91118/can-far-uvc-light-be-safely-used-as-germicide-help-understanding-a-paper"">Maybe not</a>.  Except on mucous membranes and open wounds, exposed cells will be dead-ish (part of the stratum corneum) to begin with.  Still, more investigation is needed: Is it okay to repeatedly destroy the surface layer of cells on our eyes?  It may not be a problem, but I&#x2019;d want at least a couple expert opinions if not a safety study before exposing my eyes to something like that.</p><p>And the fibroplast cell death also raises the question: What is killing the cells?  The authors kind of gloss over this point&#x2014;they cite <u><a href=""https://sci-hub.tw/https://doi.org/10.2307/3577598"">another paper</a></u> and say it&#x2019;s probably mostly cell membrane damage.  Before far-UVC is widely implemented, we need to be more confident that it is in fact cell membrane damage and not something more nefarious.</p><h2>Limited Scope of Safety Studies</h2><p>It&#x2019;s also important to note the reason why the safety studies were conducted: The authors envisioned using far-UVC to fight antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections during surgery.  They thus assumed a surgical environment, which means that applicability to public spaces is limited:</p><p>The mouth is covered by a face mask in surgery.  Safety has not been established for the parts of the inside of the mouth that don&#x2019;t have the stratum corneum.  If we&#x2019;re all wearing face masks, then this isn&#x2019;t a problem, but if we&#x2019;re imagining far-UVC light can let things go back to &#x201C;normal,&#x201D; then we need to think about the safety of our mouths.  The insides of our mouths of course won&#x2019;t be as exposed as our skin (the exact level of exposure depends on the positioning of the germicidal lamp, the reflectivity of surfaces, and the tics and facial posture of the person in question), but they will be exposed enough that we should know more about far-UVC&#x2019;s cancer risk on mucous membranes.</p><p>And what about exposed wounds? Once again, safety has not been established for cells not covered by the stratum corneum.  In the surgical environment, the nurses and doctors will not have exposed wounds.  The patient&#x2019;s decreased risk of surgical site infection is likely worth the unknown risks of far-UVC light on exposed flesh.  But what if I&#x2019;m walking around in public spaces with a skinned knee?  </p><p>Finally, the safety studies focus entirely on mammals.  In the surgical environment, humans are the only relevant entities that need to be protected.  Many public spaces are open to pets, livestock, and urban wildlife.  Even if you only recognize the value of animals&#x2019; lives with respect to what they can do for humans, many people keep reptiles or birds that they love, many people eat birds and fish and insects, and we rely on various organisms from across the animal kingdom for ecosystem stability.  We should probably try to avoid causing a skin cancer epidemic in non-mammalian clades.</p><h1>Community-level Concerns</h1><p>Even if far-UVC is completely safe for humans and other macroscopic organisms, the potential for widespread use of far-UVC leads to a number of other concerns that need to be addressed before such a solution is implemented.</p><h2>Acquired Resistance</h2><p>In general, germicides should be used conservatively because of the potential for acquired resistance.  Medicine is an evolutionary race to nowhere, with pathogens evolving to survive whatever we use to fight them.  UVC light is no exception.  As discussed in a <u><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3292282/"">literature review</a></u>, one research group managed to teach <em>E. coli</em> to better survive UVC irradiation.  </p><p>In the case of the lab-created <em>E. coli</em> acquired resistance, the degree of resistance was fairly weak.  Lethal doses of light were still very possible.   It&#x2019;s not currently known whether or not full resistance by microorganisms is possible or likely.  More experimentation will offer future scientists a clearer picture.  </p><p>In the meantime, we should reserve UVC light for cases with high potential benefit and lower potential for acquired resistance.  Ubiquitous use of far-UVC light in public spaces has the potential to teach resistance to all future pathogens, so that when the next epidemic or pandemic comes along, we&#x2019;ll be completely neutered.</p><h2>Is a More Sterile World a Healthier World?</h2><p>UVC light kills more than just pathogens.  It kills all microorganisms indiscriminately.  We don&#x2019;t know what would happen if we killed all bacteria in our public spaces.  It could lead to problems.  Bacteria play an important role in a lot of ecological processes like the decomposition of organic waste.  And if it turns out that it is a bad idea to destroy all microorganisms in our public spaces, it&#x2019;s not necessarily something we can come back from.  An established colony of beneficial or harmless bacteria can protect against the growth of harmful bacteria.  If you kill your gut bacteria with antibiotics you risk getting a harmful new microbiome.  Could the same be true at a grocery store?</p><h2>The Law of Unintended Consequences</h2><p>Even if we can establish safety for the concerns I&#x2019;ve raised above, we can never be sure that we&#x2019;ve thought of everything that can go wrong.  In environmentalism we recognize the &#x201C;<u><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unintended_consequences#Environmental_intervention"">Law of Unintended Consequences</a></u>:&#x201D;  We are very very far from understanding the world perfectly, so big technological shifts will always have unforeseen effects.</p><p>Of course, the law of unintended consequences is not a reason to hold back on change entirely.  We can never know the consequences of our actions fully, so if we always avoided acting on uncertainty, we would never do anything at all.  But it is possible to mitigate the potential adverse effects.   In general, it is better to roll out something like this in a smaller environment where it has high potential to help (like in surgical rooms).   Safety results can be assessed in those small environments before we expose the public at large.</p><h2>The Stickiness of Social Change</h2><p>Everything I&#x2019;ve said so far is a concern, but desperate times call for desperate measures.  Could the use of far-UVC be worth it, if limited to the worst of the COVID pandemic?   This is the wrong question.  We need to ask: If we start using far-UVC in public spaces during the pandemic, realistically, will we stop using it when the pandemic is over?  Things like this tend to have staying power. </p><p>This potential for staying power is especially dangerous when paired with the preceding three concerns.  The risk of acquired resistance increases with use, and we don&#x2019;t have laws that prevent misuse&#x2014;when far-UVC as a safe germicide becomes more accepted, it may, like antibiotics, be adopted by factory farms, increasing even more the probability of new resistant pathogens.</p><p>Killing all microbes in public spaces for a longer period of time may have worse consequences than limited use during a pandemic.  Scientific understanding of the microbiome is still pretty young, but we do know that these beneficial microbes are exchanged between individuals.  Ubiquitous far-UVC light would end microbiome exchange in public settings.  As far as I can tell, we have no idea what the consequences of this might be.</p><p>We don&#x2019;t know what the unintended consequences of introducing far-UVC light to public spaces might be, but we do know that the discovery of negative consequences often doesn&#x2019;t end the use of a new technology.  For example, in the 1970&#x2019;s and &#x2018;80&#x2019;s, it was assumed that UVA light was safe.  UVA does not cause direct DNA damage, and indirect damage was not yet discovered.  Accordingly, starting in the late &#x2018;70&#x2019;s, tanning salons that irradiated users with UVA light (causing a &#x201C;safe&#x201D; tan without a sunburn) opened up all across Europe and the US.  We now have known for more than 10 years that UVA light causes cancer.  And tanning beds are still around!  In most of the US, tanning beds are not only completely legal, but also accessible to minors.  One <u><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4117411/"">study</a></u> found that hundreds of thousands of skin cancer cases per year are associated with the use of tanning beds (they did not give an estimate of how many of these cases end up being fatal).  Incorrectly stating that a technology is safe can lead to huge numbers of preventable deaths, even after the mistake has been corrected.</p><h2>Human Rights and Consent</h2><p>I don&#x2019;t want to have a lengthy discussion of ethics here.  This post is intended to be more an analysis of safety and potential negative consequences.  Still I need to at least bring it up:</p><p>What about human rights?  Is it okay to irradiate people without their consent?  How do you obtain meaningful consent for something like this?</p><p>Of course, we irradiate people without their consent all the time with radio and wifi and cell phones, but those are lower energy waves far far less likely to be dangerous.  Far-UVC, even if it is non-carcinogenic and doesn&#x2019;t penetrate the stratum corneum, does definitely affect our bodies:  It kills our skin microbiome.  Just going off of my gut instinct, I&#x2019;m ethically fine with wifi, while far-UVC,in a hypothetical future where safety is more established, seems much more ethically questionable.</p><p>In the US, we put fluoride in our water.  If you don&#x2019;t want to drink fluoride you have to significantly inconvenience yourself to avoid it.  Ethically, does our approach to fluoride work for far-UVC?  In the US, we don&#x2019;t vaccinate people without consent, even though the unvaccinated damage herd immunity.  We don&#x2019;t put vaccines in the water.   Is far-UVC in public spaces more like fluoride or more like vaccines?</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>I know I&#x2019;ve seemed very negative about far-UVC for the past three thousand words, but I actually am very excited about its potential.  It is because it is exciting that I think this kind of safety investigation is necessary.  </p><p>We should not be using far-UVC as a germicide in public spaces any time soon.  A better goal might be smaller-scale implementation within medical wards to prevent hospital spread of coronavirus or other contagious illnesses, but we&#x2019;re still a long way off from even that.  There are a lot of hurdles far-UVC still needs to clear before we decide it is safe.  It may well clear those hurdles.  I hope it does.</p><p>Should investigations into far-UVC be continued?  Absolutely.  Should the investigations be expanded?  As someone who is not broadly knowledgeable about the frontiers of medicine, I have no idea whether far-UVC is being neglected relative to other promising technologies at similar stages of development.  Still, the coronavirus pandemic has demonstrated the life-saving value of this kind of research.  Public funding into this kind of research should be expanded in general, so that by the time the next pandemic hits we can know better what technologies are safe and effective.</p><h1>Main Sources</h1><h2>Inspirations </h2><p>Welch, D., Buonanno, M., Grilj, V. <em>et al.</em> Far-UVC light: <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-21058-w.pdf"">A new tool to control the spread of airborne-mediated microbial diseases</a>. <em>Sci Rep</em> <strong>8,</strong> 2752 (2018). <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-21058-w"">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-21058-w</a> </p><p>Roko Mijic, Alexey Turchin. <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/L8KGSDchPpNo48PCM/ubiquitous-far-ultraviolet-light-could-control-the-spread-of"">Ubiquitous Far-Ultraviolet Light Could Control the Spread of Covid-19 and Other Pandemics</a>. <em>LessWrong</em>.

ZwphJaoKSsGtYhhNy,The World According to Dominic Cummings,the-world-according-to-dominic-cummings,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ZwphJaoKSsGtYhhNy/the-world-according-to-dominic-cummings,2020-04-14T05:05:44.159Z,69,32,14,False,False,,"<p>Like him or loath him, Dominic Cummings is now the most politically successful rationalist-adjacent figure. For this reason, it seems like our community <em>ought</em> to try to understand him to see what we can learn. I'm sure there are people who have read more of his content than I have and who have read it more carefully than me, but I tend to see the perfect as the enemy of the good. At times I struggled to understand what he was saying because he was making references which I, an Australian not involved in the political world, wasn't familiar with, which likely limited the quality of my understanding. At other times I felt that his writing was extremely verbose and that I had to wade through a lot of content before the point became clear, so hopefully this saves you some time.</p><p>Dominic Cumming's main thesis seems to be that there are certain way of managing a team that are known to be highly effective, but which are widely ignored. In terms of politics, he argues that the government is ineffective because of self-interested bureaucrats blocking progress, who'd never think of or allow teams to be run in such a manner. One area he particularly focuses on is science funding where he argues for a British version of DARPA (now being created) is needed to take high-risk, high reward projects that could provide ridiculous amounts of economic value. One of his main critiques of the education system is that it doesn't provide the kind of leaders who are needed to run the country in the way he proposes - with an interdisciplinary background including technical skills in maths and science. As you can probably see, his views are highly interconnected.</p><h2><strong>Bureaucracy and Mismanagement</strong></h2><p>I think the best place to begin is with his criticisms of bureaucracy. He particularly focuses upon dysfunction within the British civil service, but he also saw EU rules as just another layer upon this, which is why he pushed for Brexit.</p><p>I thought <a href=""https://dominiccummings.com/2014/10/30/the-hollow-men-ii-some-reflections-on-westminster-and-whitehall-dysfunction/"">Hollow Men II</a> was best post on this. The British Civil service is quite different from the American Civil Service in that ministries are run by Permanent Secretaries who aren't supposed to be political appointees. While the Prime Minister makes the final decision, the candidates for consideration are selected by the civil service on the basis of what is supposed to be an objective process.</p><p>The idea is that this will result in appointees on the basis of merit rather than politics, however Dominic Cummings believes that it does anything but, with internal civil services politics simply replacing external governmental politics. He argues that even if a minister ultimately makes an appointment, the civil service has sufficient control over criteria and evaluation of these criteria to ensure that the options are all favourable to them.</p><p>He further believes that ministers should be control both policy and implementation, as the current civil service is unaccountable. He writes that ministers being humiliated or fired doesn't ""put the slightest dent in their [officials] day – never mind their career"". While the ministers are nominally in charge, the officials can subtly block the implementation of policies they dislike. Because the civil service is permanent and ministers transient, the ministers are always at the disadvantage. There is just too much happening for one minister and a handful of special advisors to keep track of all the details. Further, because of movement within the civil service, it is almost impossible to hold people to account for their mistakes. These will often only arise years later, but which point they and their boss will have moved on to another department. (The last two complaints seem like they are in contradiction, but maybe I am misunderstanding him here).</p><p>He argues that the internal view of the civil service is much more dysfunctional than you would believe with ministers entering every half-hour to explain a new messup and ministers receiving letters with errors in facts, spelling and grammar which they'd have to correct themselves. (Another example, is a senior civil service member trying to get the lifts fixed and eventually just giving up). He argues that in order to better control the civil service, ministers would need control over hiring, firing and promotion. They'd also need the ability to recruit talented outsiders. Further, he argues that the civil service has an incentive to ensure that their performance is never evaluated, at least not in a way that they couldn't manipulate. The focus is almost entirely on process rather than performance and they are very reluctant to change existing processes in a way that would allow this dysfunction to be addressed. Nor does he see any attempt to learn from previous mistakes.</p><p>So what is his alternative? For the civil service, his answer is contained in <a href=""https://dominiccummings.com/2014/12/04/times-op-ed-what-is-to-be-done-an-answer-to-dean-achesons-famous-quip/"">What Is To Be Done? An answer to Dean Acheson’s famous&nbsp;quip</a>. As already noted, he wants to bring in talent for the outside and provide ministers with control over hiring/firing. He thinks that the civil service should be open to hiring people with <a href=""https://dominiccummings.com/2020/01/02/two-hands-are-a-lot-were-hiring-data-scientists-project-managers-policy-experts-assorted-weirdos/"">unusual talents</a> who would never be hired according to the traditional, credentialist focus (not that he avoids credentials completely). He wants politicians to pay less attention to the media and focus on the long term. Further, he wants to shrink departments in order to simplify them and increase their focus. He argues that most politicians don't understand how ruthlessly they have to prioritise if they want to actually get things done. But beyond this, he wants to create sections of government that can be run as a startup without being smothered by other sections.</p><h2><strong>Management</strong>:</h2><p>Dominic Cummings believes that most managers have failed to learn the lessons from highly successful projects such as the Manhattan Project, ICBMs and the Apollo project and indeed that most projects are run in a completely opposite manner ""in the name of efficiency"".</p><p>Probably the most informative documents you can read from him on management is his essay - <em><a href=""https://dominiccummings.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/20180904-arpa-parc-paper1.pdf"">On the referendum &amp; #4c on Expertise: On the ARPA/PARC ‘Dream Machine’, science funding, high performance, and UK national strategy</a> </em>and<em> <a href=""https://dominiccummings.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/201702-effective-action-2-systems-engineering-to-systems-politics.pdf"">The unrecognised simplicities of effective action #2: ‘Systems engineering’ and ‘systems management’ — ideas from the Apollo programme for a ‘systems politics’.</a> </em>He argues that PARC was successful because they found great people and provided them the freedom to do what they needed to do.</p><p>Dominic Cummings argues that you need great people and not good people because ""Ten good people can't do what a single ""great"" one can"". Further, he argues that far too often HR excludes most of the best people who don't fit their narrow criteria and spends time defending the incompetent. He worries that most organisations are only set up to deal with people of moderate ability, motivation and trust. He frequently quotes John Boyd's saying: ""People, ideas, technology - in that order"". (His desire for great people ties into his policies on immigration that allow talented people, particularly scientists much easier access to the country).</p><p>He worries about micromanaging people and money as this often puts barriers in the way of their success. The intent is often to ensure efficiency and to reduce the chance of failure, but he argues that in order to achieve the greatest success we need to be willing to endure massive failures.</p><p>He also stressed the importance of connected people, not isolated people. He cites Mueller requiring NASA teams to communicate with their functional counterparts in other teams in order to exchange information and best practices and not solely through their bosses.</p><p>Dominic Cummings also described how configuration management allowed massively complex projects to be delivered on schedule. A large amount of time was spent defining the initial design and interfaces and whenever a change was made to an interface everyone using it was notified. This ensures that the system as a whole works when everything is put together.</p><p>Another technique he favours is matrix management where people report both to their department heads and to a project manager. He argues that this allows coordination across departments that is impossible with the current system.</p><p>He believes that large departments should have libraries and internal historians. Some government departments had internal libraries, but abolished them which means that they no longer know if they've already tried a particular policy. He's also a huge fan of Tetlock's work on superforecasters.</p><p>Another of his principles is that using long-term budgets save money by allowing more investment in things that have long-term payoffs and enabling long-term planning. (Another argument would be the constantly shifting priorities can result in enormous waste when projects are stopped, then restarting again). He also worries about how the focus on efficiency means that redundancy to increase resilience is often seen as waste. He frequently talks about how going faster saves money, but I couldn't find an explanation of this as far as I could see.</p><p>He argues that both centralisation and decentralisation is important. He believes that the top needs to set an overall vision with goals and a strategy, it is also important that people down the bottom can execute in whatever manner they believe to be best.</p><p>Another key property is openness so that people are comfortable enough to admit errors so that they can be learned from. Instead of punishing people for admitting errors, the focus should be on punishing people who don't admit errors.</p><h2><strong>Science and Basic Research</strong></h2><p>This brings us to Dominic Cummings vision for a British version of ARPA. He seems to believe that ARPA is responsible for the US being at the head of the internet revolution, with the countless billions of dollars of value that this brings. He believes that by creating a similar organisation Britain could be at the forefront of innovation again.</p><p>He worries that the current funding arrangements encourage incremental developments over the truly transformative. Projects that have the potential to truly transform a domain of science have a much higher chance of failure and when they fail open up the funders to criticisms of having not done their job of filtering correctly.</p><p>Short term grants mean that scientists have to waste far too much of their time filling out paperwork and reduce the viability of truly ambitious projects which often won't be able to demonstrate solid results until much further along in the process.</p><p>In addition, he worries that the recent focus on ensuring science has applications is short-sighted in that basic science often results in a huge amount of applications, but further down the line and beyond anyone's ability to predict.</p><p>He believes that it is important that it be its own agency, because if this funding were handled by an existing agency the grants would be subject to an excessive amount of bureaucracy and the selection process would tend to weed out anything too radical.</p><h2><strong>Complexity and Education</strong></h2><p>Dominic Cummings argues that there is a ""mismatch between the power of our society and our ability to cope with it"" (<a href=""https://dominiccummings.com/2014/10/30/the-hollow-men-ii-some-reflections-on-westminster-and-whitehall-dysfunction/"">link</a>). He believes that with all of its dysfunction the bureaucracy is completely unprepared for dealing with a world contuining ""complex, nonlinear, interdependent networks with feedback"" and the kinds of existential risks we will face in the future.</p><p>He worries that our educational system isn't set up to produce the kinds of leaders that are needed for such an environment. These leaders need to be trained quantitatively so that they understand things like ""exponential functions, normal distributions and conditional probability"". He argues that less than 1% of the population are capable of understanding complex systems from a cross-disciplinary perspective and these people are almost invariably not in charge of government.</p><p>His favoured approach to education would be to pick the biggest problems facing humanity in way of motivation and to explore connections between these problems to train people who can synthesise information. Anyway, he has a whole 240 page document on his preferred <a href=""https://dominiccummings.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/20130825-some-thoughts-on-education-and-political-priorities-version-2-final.pdf"">Odyssean Education System</a>, but I've only read the first few pages. </p><h2><strong>Further Links</strong>:</h2><p><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politicsa/2020/feb/06/inside-the-mind-of-dominic-cummings-brexit-boris-johnson-conservatives"">Inside the Mind of Dominic Cummings</a>: One aspect this article emphasises is his drive to get thing done, rules be damned.</p>",Chris_Leong,chris_leong,Chris_Leong,

I find this topic to be a fascinating intersection of philosophical questions in the foundations of mathematics on the one hand, and our best understanding of the nature of physical reality on the other.  It&apos;s a wonderful example of seemingly useless speculative ideas turning out to be profoundly useful in a future context.</em></p><p><em>Much of the research for this comes from <u><a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/intuitionism"">the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy article  on Intuitionism</a></u>, but I also drew on several other sources to round out my understanding. Full disclosure, I&apos;m a trained philosopher, and have a serious lay-person interest in the foundations of mathematics, but I&apos;m not an expert in any of the fields involved. </em></p><br><p>The Intuitionist philosophy of mathematics was created by the mathematician Brouwer. He first articulated the ideas in his PhD dissertation in 1907 and continued to develop them for the rest of his life. In addition, many other mathematicians and philosophers developed Brouwer&#x2019;s ideas, so now there are intuitionistic branches of math, logic, and philosophy of math. </p><p>Brouwer&#x2019;s ideas were inspired by Kant&#x2019;s theory that mathematical knowledge originates in our perception of time. </p><p>Brouwer&#x2019;s first big idea is about our ability to perceive that one moment in time gives way to another, thus, we have 1 to 2, and the relationship between 1 and 2. Then in another moment we can relate this 2-moment to another moment which we&#x2019;ll call 3. The key thing here is that these moments of subjective time perception and the experienced relationship of temporal flow between them are the real mathematical objects. Our symbols and language such as 1, 2, 3, +, -, etc are just ways to talk about our experiences of temporally structured moments of reflection. </p><p>So we can understand the idea of an infinity of natural numbers by thinking of them as a sequence of reflection upon temporal moments that goes on and on without end, 1, 2, 3, 4&#x2026;.   For Intuitionists, there are only potential infinities, not actual infinities. What that means is that we cannot regard an infinity as something that exists as a completed object (it never exists fully at any moment in time). Instead, when we talk about an infinite set, like &#x201C;the set of all natural numbers&#x201D; what we should mean is, &#x201C;the temporal process that generates each natural number with no limit on how long it may continue to run&#x201D;. </p><p>It is quite natural for me to think of this in terms of computer programming. It is easy to write a program that prints 1, 2, 3, 4, and keeps running to printing bigger and bigger numbers with no programmed stopping point. But, does this mean I&#x2019;ve generated an actual infinite set of numbers? Of course not. In finite time, my computer will only ever print out a certain finite subset of the natural numbers. The process is infinite only in the sense that it has no natural stopping point (we are not considering contingent stopping points like my computer crashing or breaking down or losing power). </p><p>In contrast to Intuitionism, classical mathematics regards infinite sets as well-defined abstract objects. So &#x201C;the set of all natural numbers&#x201D; is a valid mathematical object that exists presently and in every moment, just as much as the numbers 1 or 2. Although this is a different philosophy, the actual mathematical implications of these philosophical differences are not vary significant when dealing with natural numbers or integers or rational numbers (fractions). This is because in each of these cases, the basic members of the infinite sets are not themselves infinite.</p><p>In the set of naturals, {1, 2, 3, &#x2026;} each element can be produced through a finite (terminating) process. Similarly, every rational number can be expressed as a fraction, which is defined from integers e.g., (2 + 23 / 54).  So the list of all rationals is still generated from elements we can construct in a finite amount of time.  This means that for the most part, we can treat math that is concerned with whole or fractional numbers pretty much the same way whether we adopt an intuitionistic viewpoint or a classical viewpoint. </p><p>However, all that changes when we come to real numbers. In math, real numbers are used to describe things that change continuously (which includes almost everything that physics talks about). In geometry, the length of a line segment would be expressed as a real number. There is a famous legend about how Pythagoras believed that every number could be expressed as fractions of whole numbers, and when one his followers provided a demonstration that the hypotenuse of a triangle with bases of length 1 could not be expressed as a fraction, Pythagoras killed him on the spot for heresy (in modern terms we&#x2019;d say the length is the square root of 2).</p><p>The classical view of real numbers is that each real number is defined by an infinite set of digits. So for example, you can represent the real number one, as 1.0000000&#x2026; The zeros go on forever. Why? Because, suppose we just got lazy and said that for this real number we&#x2019;re only going to write two zeros. Then we could ask, is 1.00 greater or smaller than 1.001. Now, if we don&#x2019;t know what comes after the second zero we can&#x2019;t answer this question. But it turns out that it is very important for the concept of a continuously changing quantity that there always be an answer to this question. A continuum requires a complete linear ordering of numbers. So therefore, in the classical view, the very nature of a real number is an infinite string of digits plus some scaling factor (i.e., where to put the decimal point).</p><p>Okay, so now you might be starting to see why here the math starts to diverge more between the classical view and the intuitionistic view.  For according to the intuitionistic view a real number is not a thing, not a completed object at a given moment in time. Rather it is a process, it is an expanding series of digits. Brouwer called this a <em>choice sequence</em>. He imagined a free agent who picked each next number in the sequence. The next number might be picked in a lawlike way or in a non-lawlike way. For example, I might decide to write down all the digits of pi. 3.14159265358979&#x2026; This is a purely law-like choice sequence. However, I also might write down the digits of pi for twenty digits and then just start picking random numbers. That is also a perfectly acceptable choice sequence to generate a real number.   </p><p>However, the crucial thing here is that we never really know what the next digit in the sequence will be until <em>after the point in time</em> when it gets chosen. There is nothing in the definition of a real number that says that all the digits have to be generated according to a mechanical rule or algorithm. There is no way to see into the future of the process of choosing digits to know in advance how things turn out. So, for the intuitionist, <em>mathematical reality itself</em> is time-relative. After a digit has been chosen, the chooser can&#x2019;t go back on the choice (doing so would just be to define a <em>different </em>real number). But before the next digit has been chosen, the reality of that digit (and all subsequent ones) is fundamentally open to multiple possibilities.  </p><p>Incidentally, this also accords well with the intuitionist theory of logic, which makes mathematical truth time-relative.  An intuitionist says that a statement like &#x201C;A or not A&#x201D; is neither true nor false at a point in time where we haven&#x2019;t proven either A or not A. (In classical logic, the statement &#x201C;A or not A&#x201D; is logically true for any statement A, a tautology known as the law of the excluded middle.) For the intuitionist, the law of the excluded middle is invalid. Yet, &quot;A or not A&quot; may <em>become </em>true at a later point in time, once we have produced a proof of one of the two sides.  </p><p>Clearly, we cannot prove facts about a real number as a certain infinite string of digits if some of those digits don&#x2019;t have a determinate value at this point in time. So, the rules of intuitionistic logic and the account of the essentially temporal nature of numbers are mutually consistent.  In contrast, classical mathematics (which has been used to develop all our current theories of physics) assumes that every real number possesses an infinite degree of precision at every moment in time, and this is consistent with classical logic&apos;s endorsement of the law of the excluded middle. </p><p>As a result of these differences in the nature of real numbers (and other &quot;uncountable&quot; elements) many of the classical theorems in the mathematical field of analysis (a.k.a., calculus) are actually <em>false </em>in an intuitionistic system. However, in most of these cases, there are alternative theorems that resemble the original theorems but replace claims such as &#x201C;there exists such and such a real number&#x201D; with &#x201C;there exists arbitrarily precise approximations of such and such a real number.&#x201D; Replacing the idea of quantity as an actual infinity with the idea of the same quantity as an endless process that converges towards the quantity.  </p><p>That&#x2019;s about as far as my understanding goes. What I took from the Quanta article is that these new physics papers are trying to replace the (mathematically) classical equations of relativity and quantum mechanics with analogous equations expressed in the language of intuitionism. What this means on a physical level is that quantities like mass, position, charge, spin, etc are never infinitely precise and they become more precise as time moves forward. Since information itself is finite in the universe, there cannot be literal infinities for any physical quantity. But as time moves forward, more information might be created at some determinate rate. </p><p>This means that the <em>flow of time</em> has a real (potentially measurable) physical effect. Previously, this was not thought to be the case for general relativity. Time was just a direction, no different than spatial directions. Think of a particle existing at a position in spacetime. You can describe that position with 4 numbers, X, Y, Z, and T. If any of these numbers changes the change in the number represents a change in the position of the particle (e.g., change in  X  = X1 - X2). This implies that the change itself, the movement or flow from one position to another is not a physical thing above and beyond the facts captured by X, Y, Z, and T. This is why Einstein&#x2019;s universe is called a &#x201C;Block Universe&#x201D;. Every number that defines positions past, present, and future could exist eternally as a static mathematical description of the whole spacetime continuum. </p><p>However, once the equations are re-cast using intuitionistic mathematics, the change in time is more than just a change in a position coordinate. Because the change in time also increases the <em>precision</em> of every physical quantity, unfurling more digits across the universe. This makes time special, and gives a measurable physical meaning to the idea that time flows. </p>",Polytopos,polytopos,Polytopos,

<p>The first of these five is the Pyramid of Djoser, standing 62.5m tall. The second one—<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meidum"">Meidum Pyramid</a>—is also a large discontinuity in structure height trends by our calculation, but I judge it not robust, since it is fairly unclear what the continuation of the trend should be after the first discontinuity.

<p>The SS <em>Great Eastern</em> was a freakishly large ship. For instance, it seems to have weighed about five times as much as any previous ship.

Brunell was a 19th Century engineering hero, rated #2 greatest Briton of all time in a 2002 <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_Greatest_Britons"">BBC poll</a>, who according to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isambard_Kingdom_Brunel"">Wikipedia</a>, ‘revolutionised public transport and modern engineering’ and built ‘dockyards, the Great Western Railway (GWR), a series of steamships including the first propeller-driven transatlantic steamship, and numerous important bridges and tunnels’.</p>

This is because the largest ships must have been at least as large as the Royal Navy ones, and the trends reached a similar point just before the &lt;em&gt;Great Eastern&lt;/em&gt;, so the previous overall ship trend cannot have been much steeper on average than that of the Royal Navy.'><sup>13</sup></a></span> This gives us discontinuities of around 400 years in both displacement and tonnage (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder%27s_Old_Measurement"">BOM</a>).

<p>However that is assuming we expect ship size to increase either linearly or exponentially (our usual expectation). But looking at the ship of the line trends, both displacement and cargo capacity (measured in tonnage,<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder%27s_Old_Measurement""> BOM</a>) seemed to grow at something closer to a hyperbolic curve for some reason—apparently accelerating toward an asymptote in the late 1860s. If we had expected progress to continue this way throughout, then neither trend had any discontinuities, instead of eight or eleven of them. And supposing that overall ship size follows the same hyperbola as the military ship trends, then the <em>Great Eastern</em>’s discontinuities go from around 400 years to roughly 11 or 13 years. Which doesn&#8217;t sound big, but since this was about that many years before of the asymptote of the hyperbola at which point arbitrarily large ships were theoretically expected, the discontinuities couldn’t have been much bigger.</p>
<p>Our data ended for some reason just around the apparently impending ship size singularity of the late 1860s. But my impression is that not much happened for a while—it<a href=""https://aiimpacts.org/historic-trends-in-ship-size/""> apparently</a> took forty years for a ship larger than the <em>Great Eastern</em> to be built, on many measures.</p>
<p>I am unsure what to make of the apparently erroneous and unforced investment in the most absurdly enormous ship happening within a decade or two of the point at which trend extrapolation appears to have suggested arbitrarily large ships. Was Brunell aware of the trend? Did the forces that produced the rest of the trend likewise try to send all the players in the ship-construction economy up the asymptote, where they crashed into some yet unmet constraint? It is at least nice to have more examples of what happens when singularities are reached in the human world.</p>

<p>At a glance, on Wikipedia&#8217;s <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transatlantic_telegraph_cable"">telling</a>, it sounds as though the perseverance of one person—<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrus_West_Field"">Cyrus West Field</a>—might have affected when fast transatlantic communication appeared by years. He seems to have led all five efforts, supplied substantial money himself, and ongoingly fundraised and formed new companies, even amidst a broader lack of enthusiasm after initial failures. (He was also<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Congressional_Gold_Medal_recipients""> given a congressional gold medal</a> for establishing the transatlantic telegraph cable, suggesting the US congress also has this impression.) His actions wouldn&#8217;t have affected how much of a discontinuity either telegraph was by much, but it is interesting if such a large development in a seemingly important area might have been accelerated much by a single person.</p>
<p>The second telegraph cable was laid by the <em>Great Eastern</em>, the discontinuously large ship of two sections ago. Is there some reason for these two big discontinuities to be connected? For instance, did one somehow cause the other? That doesn&#8217;t seem plausible. The main way I can think of that the transatlantic telegraph could have caused the <em>Great Eastern</em>&#8216;s size would be if the economic benefits of being able to lay cable were anticipated and effectively subsidized the ship. I haven&#8217;t heard of this being an intended use for the <em>Great Eastern</em>. And given that the first transatlantic telegraph was not laid by the <em>Great Eastern</em>, it seems unlikely that such a massive ship was strictly needed for the success of a second one at around that time, though the second cable used<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transatlantic_telegraph_cable#Failure_of_the_first_cable""> was apparently around twice as heavy as the first</a>. Another possibility is that some other common factor made large discontinuities more possible. For instance, perhaps it was an unusually feasible time and place for solitary technological dreamers to carry out ambitious and economically adventurous projects.</p>

<h3>The first non-stop transatlantic flight</h3>
<p><em>Discontinuity in both<a href=""http://aiimpacts.org/historic-trends-in-transatlantic-passenger-travel/""> speed of passenger travel across the Atlantic Ocean</a> and <a href=""http://aiimpacts.org/historic-trends-in-long-range-military-payload-delivery/"">speed of military payload travel across the Atlantic Ocean</a></em></p>
<p>Ships were the fastest way to cross the Atlantic Ocean until the end of World War I. Passenger liners had been getting incrementally faster for about eighty years, and the fastest regular passenger liner was given a special title, &#8216;<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Riband"">Blue Riband</a>&#8216;. Powered heavier-than-air flight got started in 1903, but at first planes only traveled hundreds of feet, and it took time to expand that to the 1600 or so miles needed to cross the Atlantic in one hop.<span id='easy-footnote-19-2389' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://aiimpacts.org/discontinuous-progress-in-history-an-update/#easy-footnote-bottom-19-2389' title='Crossing in many hops between boats was an option, though presumably fairly large hops would still be needed to be competitive.&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtiss_NC-4#The_transatlantic_flight&quot;&gt; The first multi-leg transatlantic flight&lt;/a&gt; took place in 1919, a few weeks before the first non-stop one, and took more than ten days, though the biggest hop was more than half the ocean and only took about 15 hours.'><sup>19</sup></a></span>
<p>The first non-stop transatlantic flight was made shortly after the end of WWI, in 1919. The Daily Mail<a href=""https://www.aerosociety.com/news/the-great-transatlantic-race/""> had offered</a> a large cash prize, on hold during the war, and with the resumption of peace,<a href=""https://www.aerosociety.com/news/the-great-transatlantic-race/""> a slew</a> of competitors prepared to fly.<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transatlantic_flight_of_Alcock_and_Brown""> Alcock and Brown</a> were the first to do it successfully, in a modified bomber plane, taking around 16 hours, for an average speed around four times faster than the Blue Riband.</p>

<p>One might expect discontinuities to be especially likely in a metric like &#8216;speed to cross the Atlantic&#8217;, which involves a sharp threshold on a non-speed axis for inclusion in the speed contest. For instance if planes incrementally improved on speed and range (and cost and comfort) every year, but couldn&#8217;t usefully cross the ocean at all until their range reached 1600 miles, then decades of incremental speed improvements could all hit the transatlantic speed record at once, when the range reaches that number.</p>
<p>Is this what happened? It looks like it. The Wright Flyer<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright_Flyer#Specifications_(Wright_Flyer)""> apparently</a> had a maximum speed of 30mph. That&#8217;s about the record average ocean liner speed in 1909. So if the Wright Flyer had had the range to cross the Atlantic in 1903 at that speed, it would have been about six years ahead of the ship speed trend and wouldn&#8217;t have registered as a substantial discontinuity. <span id='easy-footnote-20-2389' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://aiimpacts.org/discontinuous-progress-in-history-an-update/#easy-footnote-bottom-20-2389' title='This is ignoring the difference between maximum momentary speed and maximum average speed over thousands of miles—judging the Wright Flyer and the ocean liners consistently on one or the other of these, the Wright Flyer was probably not ahead of the trend at all.'><sup>20</sup></a></span> But because it didn&#8217;t have the range, and because the speed of planes was growing faster than that of ships, in 1919 when planes could at last fly thousands of miles, they were way ahead of ships.</p>

<p>A few characteristics of nuclear weapons that could relate to their discontinuousness:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>New physical phenomenon</strong>: nuclear weapons are based on <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fission#Discovery_of_nuclear_fission"">nuclear fission</a>, which was recently discovered, and allowed human use of nuclear energy (which exploits the strong fundamental force) whereas past explosives were based on chemical energy (which exploits the electromagnetic force). New forms of energy are rare in human history, and nuclear energy stored in a mass is characteristically much higher than chemical energy stored in it.</li>
<li><strong>Massive investment</strong>: the Manhattan Project, which developed the first nuclear weapons, cost around <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Project"">$23 billion in 2018 dollars</a>. This was presumably a sharp increase over previous explosives research spending.</li>
<li><strong>Late understanding</strong>: it looks like nuclear weapons were only understood as a possibility after it was well worth trying to develop them at a huge scale.</li>
<li><strong>Mechanism involves a threshold</strong>: nuclear weapons are based on nuclear chain reactions, which require a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_mass"">critical mass</a> of material (how much varies by circumstance).</li>
</ul>

<p>I don&#8217;t have much idea why the Paris Gun traveled so much higher than previous weapons. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Gun"">Wikipedia</a> suggests that its goals were psychological rather than physically effective warfare:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As military weapons, the Paris Guns were not a great success: the payload was small, the barrel required frequent replacement, and the guns&#8217; accuracy was good enough for only city-sized targets. The German objective was to build a psychological weapon to attack the morale of the Parisians, not to destroy the city itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This might explain an unusual trade-off of distance (and therefore altitude) against features like accuracy and destructive ability. On this story, building a weapon to shoot a projectile 25 miles into the air had been feasible for some time, but wasn&#8217;t worth it. This highlights the more general possibility that the altitude trend was perhaps more driven by the vagaries of demand for different tangentially-altitude-related ends than by technological progress.</p>
<p>The German military<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Gun""> apparently</a> dismantled the Paris Guns before departing, and did not comply with a Treaty of Versailles requirement to turn over a complete gun to the Allies, so the guns&#8217; capabilities are not known with certainty. However it sounds like the shells were clearly observed in Paris, and the relevant gun was clearly observed around 70 miles away, so the range is probably not ambiguous, and the altitude reached by a projectile is closely related to the range. So uncertainty around the gun probably doesn&#8217;t affect our conclusions.</p>
<h3>The first intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs)</h3>
<p><em>Discontinuity in<a href=""http://aiimpacts.org/historic-trends-in-long-range-military-payload-delivery/""> average speed of military payload crossing the Atlantic Ocean</a></em></p>
<p>For most of history, the fastest way to send a military payload across the Atlantic Ocean was to put it on a boat or plane, much like a human passenger. So the <a href=""http://aiimpacts.org/historic-trends-in-long-range-military-payload-delivery/"">maximum speed of sending a military payload across the Atlantic Ocean</a> followed the<a href=""http://aiimpacts.org/historic-trends-in-transatlantic-passenger-travel/""> analogous passenger travel trend</a>. However in August 1957, the two abruptly diverged with the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercontinental_ballistic_missile#Cold_War"">first successful test</a> of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM)—the Russian <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-7_Semyorka"">R-7 Semyorka</a>. Early ICBMs traveled at around 11 thousand miles per hour, taking the minimum time to send a military payload between Moscow and New York for instance from around 14 hours to around 24 minutes.<span id='easy-footnote-25-2389' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://aiimpacts.org/discontinuous-progress-in-history-an-update/#easy-footnote-bottom-25-2389' title='Based on my rough calculations using distance and speed, not including other steps in military payload sending processes.'><sup>25</sup></a></span>

<p>A &#8216;<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistic_missile"">ballistic</a>&#8216; missile is unpowered during most of its flight, and so follows a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projectile_motion"">ballistic trajectory</a>—the path of anything thrown into the air. Interestingly, this means that in order to go far enough to traverse the Atlantic, it has to be going a certain speed. Ignoring the curvature of the Earth or friction, this would be about 7000 knots for the shortest transatlantic distance—70% of its actual speed, and enough to be hundreds of years of discontinuity in the late 50s.<span id='easy-footnote-26-2389' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://aiimpacts.org/discontinuous-progress-in-history-an-update/#easy-footnote-bottom-26-2389' title='Incidentally, the actual speed of the first ICBM looks like roughly what you need to get range from Russia to the USA, by my simple calculations, ignoring earth curvature.'><sup>26</sup></a></span> So assuming ballistic missiles crossed the ocean when they did, they had to produce a large discontinuity in the speed trend.</p>
<p>Does this mean the ICBM was required to be a large discontinuity? <span style=""font-size: inherit;"">No—there would be no discontinuity if rockets were improving in line with planes, and so transatlantic rockets were developed later, or ICBM-speed planes earlier. But it means that even if the trends for rocket distance and speed are incremental and start from irrelevantly low numbers, if they have a faster rate of growth than planes, and the threshold in distance required implies a speed way above the current record, then a large discontinuity must happen</span></p>
<p>This situation also means that you could plausibly have predicted the discontinuity ahead of time, if you were watching the trends. Seeing the rocket speed trend traveling upward faster than the plane speed trend, you could forecast that when it hit a speed that implied an intercontinental range, intercontinental weapons delivery speed would jump upward.</p>

<h3>YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7 </sub>as a superconductor</h3>
<p><em>Discontinuity in </em><a href=""http://aiimpacts.org/historic-trends-in-the-maximum-superconducting-temperature/""><em>warmest temperature of superconduction</em></a></p>
<p>When an ordinary material conducts electricity, it has some <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance_and_conductance"">resistance</a> (or opposition to the flow of electrons) which <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance_and_conductance"">takes</a> energy to overcome. The resistance can be gradually lowered by cooling the material down. For some materials though, there is a temperature threshold below which their resistance abruptly drops to zero, meaning for instance that electricity can flow through them indefinitely with no input of energy. These are &#8216;<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superconductivity"">superconductors</a>&#8216;.</p>
<p>Superconductors were <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superconductivity"">discovered</a> in 1911. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superconductivity#History_of_superconductivity"">The first one observed</a>, mercury, could superconduct below 4.2 Kelvin. From then on, more superconductors were discovered, and the warmest observed temperatures of superconduction gradually grew. In 1957, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BCS_theory"">BCS theory</a> was developed to explain the phenomenon (winning its authors a Nobel Prize), and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superconductivity#High-temperature_superconductivity"">was understood</a> to rule out superconduction above temperatures of around 30K. But <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superconductivity#High-temperature_superconductivity"">in 1986</a> a new superconductor was found with a threshold temperature around 30K, and composed of a surprising material: a &#8216;ceramic&#8217; involving oxygen rather than an alloy.<span id='easy-footnote-27-2389' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://aiimpacts.org/discontinuous-progress-in-history-an-update/#easy-footnote-bottom-27-2389' title='&amp;#8220;What Bednorz and Müller did was to abandon the “conventional” materials – alloys of different composition. Since 1983 they have concentrated on oxides which, apart from containing oxygen, include copper and one or more of the rare earth metals. The new idea was that the copper atoms in a material of this kind could be made to transport electrons, which interact more strongly with the surrounding crystal than they do in normal electrical conductors. To obtain a chemically stable material the two researchers added barium to crystals or lanthanum-copper-oxide to produce a ceramic material that became the first successful “hightemperature” [sic] superconductor.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

<p>This seems like a striking instance of the story where the new technology doesn&#8217;t necessarily cause a jump so much as a new rate of progress.

<p>It is interesting to me that this is associated with a substantial update in very basic science, much like nuclear weapons. I&#8217;m not sure if that makes basic science updates ripe for discontinuity, or if there are just enough of them that some would show up in this list. (Though glancing at <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_scientific_discoveries#20th_century"">this list</a> suggests to me that there were about 70 at this level in the 20th Century, and probably many fewer immediately involving a new capability rather than e.g. an increased understanding of pulsars. Penicillin also makes that list though, and we didn&#8217;t find any discontinuities it caused.)</p>

We are usually only looking at a trend for a certain period of time, so there may be discontinuities at other times, and our datasets are presumably somewhat inaccurate and incomplete.'><sup>32</sup></a></span>) &#8211; follow the links to read about any in detail:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""https://aiimpacts.org/effect-of-alexnet-on-historic-trends-in-image-recognition/"">Alexnet</a>: This convolutional neural network made important progress on labeling images correctly, but was only a few years ahead of the previous trend of success in the ImageNet contest (which was also a very short trend).</li>
<li><a href=""https://aiimpacts.org/historic-trends-in-light-intensity/"">Light intensity</a>: We measured argon flashes in 1943 as a large discontinuity, but I judge it non-robust. The rate of progress shot up at around that time though, from around half a percent per year to an average of 90% per year over the next 65 years, the rest of it involving increasingly intense lasers.</li>
<li><a href=""https://aiimpacts.org/historic-trends-in-book-production/"">Real price of books</a>: After the invention of the printing press, the real price of books seems to have dropped sharply, relative to a recent upward trajectory. However this was not long after a similarly large drop purportedly from paper replacing parchment. So in the brief history we have data for, the second drop is not unusual. We are also too uncertain about this data to confidently conclude much.</li>
<li><a href=""https://aiimpacts.org/historic-trends-in-book-production/"">Manuscripts and books produced over the last hundred years</a>: This was another attempt to find a discontinuity from the printing press. We measured several discontinuities, including one after the printing press. However, it is not very surprising for a somewhat noisy trend with data points every hundred years to be a hundred years ahead of the best-guess curve sometimes. The discontinuity at the time of the printing press was not much larger than others in nearby centuries. The clearer effect of the printing press at this scale appears to be a new faster growth trajectory.</li>
<li><a href=""https://aiimpacts.org/historic-trends-in-telecommunications-performance/"">Bandwidth distance product</a>: This measures how much can be sent how far by communication media. It was just pretty smooth.</li>
<li><a href=""https://aiimpacts.org/historic-trends-in-telecommunications-performance/"">Total transatlantic bandwidth</a>: This is how much cable goes under the Atlantic Ocean. It was also pretty smooth.</li>
<li><a href=""https://aiimpacts.org/effect-of-eli-whitneys-cotton-gin-on-historic-trends-in-cotton-ginning/"">Whitney’s cotton gin</a>: Cotton gins remove seeds from cotton. Whitney’s gin is often considered to have revolutionized the cotton industry and maybe contributed to the American Civil War. We looked at its effects on pounds of cotton ginned per person per day, and our best guess is that it was a moderate discontinuity, but the trend is pretty noisy and the available data is pretty dubious. Interestingly, progress on gins was speeding up a lot prior to Whitney (the two previous data points look like much bigger discontinuities, but we are less sure that we aren’t just missing data that would make them part of fast incremental progress). We also looked at evidence on whether Whitney’s gin might have been a discontinuity in the more inclusive metric of cost per value of cotton ginned, but this was unclear. As evidence about the impact of Whitney’s gin, US cotton production appears to us to have been on the same radically fast trajectory before it as after it, and it seems people continued to use various other ginning methods for at least sixty years.</li>
<li><a href=""https://aiimpacts.org/historic-trends-in-slow-light-technology/"">Group index of light or pulse delay of light</a>: These are two different measures of how slowly light can be made to move through a medium. It can now be ‘stopped’ in some sense, though not the strict normal one. We measured two discontinuities in group index, but both were relative to a fairly unclear trend, so don’t seem robust. </li>
<li><a href=""https://aiimpacts.org/particle-accelerator-performance-progress/"">Particle accelerator performance</a>: natural measures include center-of-mass energy, particle energy, and lorentz factor achieved. All of these progressed fairly smoothly.</li>
<li><a href=""https://aiimpacts.org/penicillin-and-historic-syphilis-trends/"">US syphilis cases, US syphilis deaths, effectiveness of syphilis treatment, or inclusive costs of syphilis treatment</a>: We looked at syphilis trends because we thought penicillin might have caused a discontinuity in something, and syphilis was apparently a key use case. But we didn’t find any discontinuities there. US syphilis deaths became much rarer over a period around its introduction, but the fastest drop slightly predates plausible broad use of penicillin, and there are no discontinuities of more than ten years in either US deaths or cases. Penicillin doesn’t even appear to be much more effective than its predecessor, conditional on being used.<span id='easy-footnote-33-2389' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://aiimpacts.org/discontinuous-progress-in-history-an-update/#easy-footnote-bottom-33-2389' title='On a tentative survey of the literature, which is not enough evidence to be that confident.'><sup>33</sup></a></span> Rather, it seems to have been much less terrible to use (which in practice makes treatment more likely). That suggested to us that progress might have been especially visible in ‘inclusive costs of syphilis treatment’. There isn’t ready quantitative data for that, but we tried to get a rough qualitative picture of the landscape. It doesn’t look clearly discontinuous, because the trend was already radically improving. The preceding medicine sounds terrible to take, yet was nicknamed ‘<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsphenamine"">magic bullet</a>’ and is considered &#8216;<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsphenamine"">the first effective treatment for syphilis</a>&#8216;. Shortly beforehand, <a href=""https://jmvh.org/article/syphilis-its-early-history-and-treatment-until-penicillin-and-the-debate-on-its-origins/"">mercury was still a usual treatment</a> and deliberately contracting malaria had recently been added to the toolbox.</li>
<li><a href=""https://aiimpacts.org/discontinuity-from-nuclear-weapons/"">Nuclear weapons on cost-effectiveness of explosives</a>: Using nuclear weapons as explosives was not clearly cheaper than using traditional explosives, let alone discontinuously cheaper. However these are very uncertain estimates.</li>
<li><a href=""https://aiimpacts.org/historic-trends-in-land-speed-records/"">Maximum landspeed</a>: Landspeed saw vast and sudden changes in the rate of progress, but the developments were so close together that none was very far from average progress between the first point and the most recent one. If we more readily expect short term trends to continue (which arguably makes sense when they are as well-defined as these), then we find several moderate discontinuities. Either way, the more basic thing going on appears to be very distinct changes in the rate of progress.</li>
<li><a href=""https://aiimpacts.org/historic-trends-in-chess-ai/"">AI chess performance</a>: This was so smooth that a point four years ahead of the trend in 2008 is eye-catching.</li>
<li><a href=""https://aiimpacts.org/effects-of-breech-loading-rifles-on-historic-trends-in-firearm-progress/"">Breech-loading rifles on the firing rate of guns</a>: Breech-loading rifles were suggested to us as a potential discontinuity, and firing rate seemed like a metric on which they plausibly excelled. However there seem to have been other guns with similarly fast fire rates at the time breech-loading rifles were introduced. We haven’t checked whether they produced a discontinuity in some other metric (e.g. one that combines several features), or if anything else caused discontinuities in firing rate.</li>

<h1>III. Some observations</h1>
<h3>Prevalence of discontinuities</h3>
<p>Some observations on the overall prevalence of discontinuities:</p>
<ul>

<li>On average <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iMIZ57Ka9-ZYednnGeonC-NqwGC7dKiHN9S-TAxfVdQ/edit#gid=1906429870&amp;range=AE43"">1.4%</a> of new data points in a trend make for large robust discontinuities, or <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iMIZ57Ka9-ZYednnGeonC-NqwGC7dKiHN9S-TAxfVdQ/edit#gid=1906429870&amp;range=AE49"">4.9%</a> for trends which have one.</li>
<li>On average <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iMIZ57Ka9-ZYednnGeonC-NqwGC7dKiHN9S-TAxfVdQ/edit#gid=1906429870&amp;range=AB43"">14%</a> of total progress in a trend came from large robust discontinuities (or <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iMIZ57Ka9-ZYednnGeonC-NqwGC7dKiHN9S-TAxfVdQ/edit#gid=1906429870&amp;range=AC43"">16%</a> of logarithmic progress), or <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iMIZ57Ka9-ZYednnGeonC-NqwGC7dKiHN9S-TAxfVdQ/edit#gid=1906429870&amp;range=AB49"">38%</a> among trends which have at least one </li>
</ul>
<p>This all suggests that discontinuities, and large discontinuities in particular, are more common than I thought previously (though still not that common). One reason for this change is that I was treating difficulty of finding good cases of discontinuous progress as more informative than I do now. I initially thought there weren’t many around because suggested discontinuities often turned out not to be discontinuous, and there weren’t a huge number of promising suggestions. However we later got more good suggestions, and found many discontinuities where we weren’t necessarily looking for them. So I’m inclined to think there are a few around, but our efforts at seeking them out specifically just weren’t very effective. Another reason for a larger number now is that our more systematic methods now turn up many cases that don’t look very remarkable to the naked eye (those I have called non-robust), which we did not necessarily notice earlier. How important these are is less clear.</p>
<h3>Discontinuities go with changes in the growth rate</h3>
<p>It looks like discontinuities are often associated with changes in the growth rate. At a glance, 15 of the 38 trends had a relatively sharp change in their rate of progress at least once in their history. These changes in the growth rate very often coincided with discontinuities—in fourteen of the fifteen trends, at least one sharp change coincided with one of the discontinuities.<span id='easy-footnote-35-2389' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://aiimpacts.org/discontinuous-progress-in-history-an-update/#easy-footnote-bottom-35-2389' title='We haven’t really carefully measured this, so my numbers here might be a bit off.'><sup>35</sup></a></span> If this is a real relationship, it means that if you see a discontinuity, there is a much heightened chance of further fast progress coming up. This seems important, but is a quick observation and should probably be checked and investigated further if we wanted to rely on it.</p>
<h3>Where do we see discontinuities?</h3>
<p>Among these case studies, when is a development more likely to produce a discontinuity in a trend?<span id='easy-footnote-36-2389' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://aiimpacts.org/discontinuous-progress-in-history-an-update/#easy-footnote-bottom-36-2389' title='Remembering that this dataset is biased toward trends that people thought might be discontinuous, so e.g. it could be that A and B type trends both see discontinuities at the same rate, but outside observers are more likely to correctly identify discontinuities in A type trends, so most type A trends we look at have them, whereas type B trends do not.'><sup>36</sup></a></span> Some observations so far, based on the broader class including non-robust discontinuities, except where noted:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>When the trend is about products not technical measures</strong> <br />If we loosely divide trends into ‘technical’ (to do with scientific results e.g. highest temperature of a superconductor), ‘product’ (to do with individual objects meant for use e.g. cotton ginned by a cotton gin, height of building), ‘industry’ (to do with entire industries e.g. books produced in the UK) or ‘societal’ (to do with features of non-industry society e.g. syphilis deaths in the US), then ‘product’ trends saw around <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iMIZ57Ka9-ZYednnGeonC-NqwGC7dKiHN9S-TAxfVdQ/edit#gid=600317213&amp;range=Z56:AA56"">four times as many</a> discontinuities as technical trends, and the other two are too small to say much. (Product trends are less than twice as likely to have any discontinuities, so the difference was largely in how many discontinuities they have per trend.)</li>
<li><strong>When the trend is about less important &#8216;features&#8217; rather than overall performance</strong> <br />If we loosely divide trends into ‘features’ (things that are good but not the main point of the activity), ‘performance proxies’ (things that are roughly the point of the activity) and ‘value proxies’ (things that roughly measure the net value of the activity, accounting for its costs as well as performance), then <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iMIZ57Ka9-ZYednnGeonC-NqwGC7dKiHN9S-TAxfVdQ/edit#gid=600317213&amp;range=AD56:AE57"">features were more discontinuous than performance proxies</a>.<span id='easy-footnote-37-2389' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://aiimpacts.org/discontinuous-progress-in-history-an-update/#easy-footnote-bottom-37-2389' title='There were only three value proxy measures, with no discontinuities. Aside from the small number, these were also particularly hard trends to measure, so more likely to have discontinuities that we missed.'><sup>37</sup></a></span></li>
<li><strong>When the trend is about ‘product features’</strong> <br />(Unsurprisingly, given the above.) Overall, the 16 ‘<a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iMIZ57Ka9-ZYednnGeonC-NqwGC7dKiHN9S-TAxfVdQ/edit#gid=600317213&amp;range=K1"">product features</a>’ we looked at had <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iMIZ57Ka9-ZYednnGeonC-NqwGC7dKiHN9S-TAxfVdQ/edit#gid=600317213&amp;range=AG56:AH56"">4.6 discontinuities</a> per trend on average, whereas the 22 other metrics had 0.7 discontinuities per trend on average (<a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iMIZ57Ka9-ZYednnGeonC-NqwGC7dKiHN9S-TAxfVdQ/edit#gid=600317213&amp;range=AG48:AH48"">2 vs. 0.3 for large discontinuities</a>).<span id='easy-footnote-38-2389' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://aiimpacts.org/discontinuous-progress-in-history-an-update/#easy-footnote-bottom-38-2389' title='That product features are much more likely to have discontinuities, and that we mostly look at product features is some evidence that we successfully directed our attention toward more discontinuous things. However it could also be that product features are relatively measurable, so we are both inclined to look at them, and can find discontinuities in them. For some of our metrics it was clear from the outset that it would be hard to find discontinuities if they were there, and we were checking for strong evidence of a discontinuity or a lack of discontinuity in spite of ambiguous information.'><sup>38</sup></a></span> &#8216;Product features&#8217; include for instance sizes of ships and fire rate of guns, whereas non-product features include total books produced per century, syphilis deaths in the US, and highest temperature of known superconductors.</li>
<li><strong>When the development occurs after 1800</strong> <br />Most of the discontinuities we found <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iMIZ57Ka9-ZYednnGeonC-NqwGC7dKiHN9S-TAxfVdQ/edit#gid=1171388482&amp;range=H16:I18"">happened after 1800</a>. This could be a measurement effect, since much more recent data is available, and if we can’t find enough data to be confident, we are not deeming things discontinuities. For instance, the two obscure <a href=""http://aiimpacts.org/effect-of-eli-whitneys-cotton-gin-on-historic-trends-in-cotton-ginning/"">cotton gins</a> before Whitney’s famous 1793 one that look responsible for huge jumps according to our sparse and untrustworthy 1700s data. The concentration of discontinuities since 1800 might also be related to progress speeding up in the last couple of centuries. Interestingly, since 1800 the rate of discontinuities doesn’t seem to be obviously increasing. For instance, <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iMIZ57Ka9-ZYednnGeonC-NqwGC7dKiHN9S-TAxfVdQ/edit#gid=1171388482&amp;range=K111"">seven of nine</a> robust discontinuous events since 1900 happened by 1960.<span id='easy-footnote-39-2389' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://aiimpacts.org/discontinuous-progress-in-history-an-update/#easy-footnote-bottom-39-2389' title='See ‘timing of discontinuities’ tab in spreadsheet'><sup>39</sup></a></span></li>
<li><strong>When the trend is about travel speed across the Atlantic <br /></strong>Four of our ten robust discontinuous events of over a hundred years came from the three transatlantic travel speed trends we considered. They are also <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iMIZ57Ka9-ZYednnGeonC-NqwGC7dKiHN9S-TAxfVdQ/edit#gid=1906429870&amp;range=AQ63:AR66"">high on non-robust discontinuities</a>.</li>
<li><strong>When the trend doesn’t have a consistent exponential or linear shape</strong> <br />To measure discontinuities, we had to extrapolate past progress. We did this at each point, based on what the curve looked like so far. Some trends we consistently called exponential, some consistently linear, and some sometimes seemed linear and sometimes exponential. The ten in this third lot all had discontinuities, whereas the 20 that consistently looked either exponential or linear were about <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iMIZ57Ka9-ZYednnGeonC-NqwGC7dKiHN9S-TAxfVdQ/edit#gid=1906429870&amp;range=Q45"">half as likely</a> to have discontinuities.<span id='easy-footnote-40-2389' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://aiimpacts.org/discontinuous-progress-in-history-an-update/#easy-footnote-bottom-40-2389' title='Another seven were neither of these, usually because it was too hard to find data, so we were mostly looking for evidence about whether a single data point was plausibly discontinuous without much longer term trend.

<li><strong>When the trend is in the size of some kind of object</strong><br />‘Object size’ trends <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iMIZ57Ka9-ZYednnGeonC-NqwGC7dKiHN9S-TAxfVdQ/edit#gid=1906429870&amp;range=AJ56"">had</a> over five discontinuities per trend, compared to the average of <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iMIZ57Ka9-ZYednnGeonC-NqwGC7dKiHN9S-TAxfVdQ/edit#gid=1906429870&amp;range=AQ63"">around 2</a> across all trends.</li>
<li><strong>When<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isambard_Kingdom_Brunel""> Isambard Kingdom Brunel</a> is somehow involved</strong> <br />I mentioned Brunel above in connection with the <em>Great Eastern</em>. As well as designing that discontinuously large ship, which lay one of the discontinuously fast transatlantic telegraph cables, he designed the non-robustly discontinuous earlier ship <em>Warrior.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>I feel like there are other obvious patterns that I&#8217;m missing. Some other semi-obvious patterns that I&#8217;m noticing but don&#8217;t have time to actually check now, I am putting in the next section.</p>
<h3>More things to observe</h3>
<p>There are lots of other interesting things to ask about this kind of data, in particular regarding what kinds of things tend to see jumps. Here are some questions that we might answer in future, or which we welcome you to try to answer (and hope our data helps with):</p>
<ul>
<li>Are trends less likely to see discontinuities when more effort is going more directly into maximizing them? (Do discontinuities arise easily in trends people don’t care about?)</li>
<li>How does the chance of discontinuity change with time, or with speed of progress? (Many trends get much faster toward the end, and there are more discontinuities toward the end, but how are they related at a finer scale?)</li>
<li>Do discontinuities come from ‘insights’ more than from turning known cranks of progress?</li>
<li>Are AI related trends similar to other trends? The two AI-related trends we investigated saw no substantial discontinuities, but two isn’t very many, and there is a persistent idea that once you can do something with AI, you can do it fast.<span id='easy-footnote-41-2389' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://aiimpacts.org/discontinuous-progress-in-history-an-update/#easy-footnote-bottom-41-2389' title='Somewhat at odds with our other &lt;a href=&quot;http://aiimpacts.org/is-the-range-of-human-intelligence-small/&quot;&gt;minimal investigation&lt;/a&gt;'><sup>41</sup></a></span></li>
<li>Are trends more continuous as they depend on more ‘parts’? (e.g. is maximum fuel energy density more jumpy than maximum engine power, which is more jumpy than maximum car speed?) This would make intuitive sense, but is somewhat at odds with the 8 ‘basic physics related’ trends we looked at not being especially jumpy.</li>
<li>How does the specificity of trends relate to their jumpiness? I&#8217;d intuitively expect jumpier narrow trends to average out in aggregate to something smooth (for instance, so that maximum Volkswagen speed is more jumpy than maximum car speed, which is more jumpy than maximum transport speed, which is more jumpy than maximum man-made object speed). But I&#8217;m not sure that makes sense, and a contradictory observation is that discontinuities or sudden rate changes happen when a continuous narrow trend shoots up and intersects the broader trend. For instance, if record rocket altitude is continuously increasing, and record non-rocket altitude is continuously increasing more slowly but is currently ahead, then <a href=""http://aiimpacts.org/discontinuity-in-altitude-records/"">overall altitude</a> will have some kind of corner in it where rockets surpass non-rockets. If you drew a line through liquid fuel rockets, pellets would have been less surprising, but they were surprising in terms of the broader measure.</li>
<li>What does a more random sample of trends look like?</li>
<li>What is the distribution of step sizes in a progress trend? (Looking at small ones as well as discontinuities.) If it generally follows a recognizable distribution, that could provide more information about the chance of rare large steps. It might also help recognize trends that are likely to have large discontinuities based on their observed distribution of smaller steps.</li>
<li>Relatively abrupt changes in the growth rate seem common. Are these in fact often abrupt rather than ramping up slowly? (Are discontinuities in the derivative relevantly different from more object-level discontinuities, for our purposes?)</li>
<li>How often is a ‘new kind of thing’ responsible for discontinuities? (e.g. the first direct flight and the first telegraph cable produced big discontinuities in trends that had previously been topped by ships for some time.) How often are they responsible for changes in the growth rate? </li>
<li>If you drew a line through liquid fuel rockets, it seems like pellets may not be surprise, but they were because of the broader measure. How often is that a thing? I think a similar thing may have happened with the altitude records, and the land speed records, both also with rockets in particular. In both of those // similar thing happened with rockets in particular in land-speed and altitude? Could see trend coming up from below for some time.</li>
<li>Is more fundamental science more likely to be discontinuous? </li>
<li>With planes and ICBMs crossing the ocean, there seemed to be a pattern where incremental progress had to pass a threshold on some dimension before incremental progress on a dimension of interest mattered, which gave rise to discontinuity. Is that a common pattern? (Is that a correct way to think about what was going on?)</li>
<li>If a thing sounds like a big deal, is it likely to be discontinuous? My impression was that these weren&#8217;t very closely connected, nor entirely disconnected. Innovations popularly considered a big deal were often not discontinuous, as far as we could tell. For instance penicillin seemed to help with syphilis a lot, but we didn’t find any actual discontinuity in anything. And we measured Whitney’s cotton gin as producing a moderate discontinuity in cotton ginned per person per day, but it isn’t robust, and there look to have been much larger jumps from earlier more obscure gins. On the other hand, nuclear weapons are widely considered a huge deal, and were a big discontinuity. It would be nice to check this more systematically. </li>
</ul>
<h1>IV. Summary</h1>
<ul>
<li>Looking at past technological progress can help us tell whether AI trends are likely to be discontinuous or smooth</li>
<li>We looked for discontinuities in 38 technological trends</li>
<li>We found ten events that produced robust discontinuities of over a hundred years in at least one trend. (Djoser, Great Eastern, Telegraphs, Bridge, transatlantic flight, Paris Gun, ICBM, nukes, high temperature superconductors.)</li>
<li>We found <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iMIZ57Ka9-ZYednnGeonC-NqwGC7dKiHN9S-TAxfVdQ/edit#gid=1994197408&amp;range=A95"">53</a> events that produced smaller or less robust discontinuities</li>
<li>The average rate of large robust discontinuities per year across trends was about 0.1%, but the chance of a given level of progress arising in a large robust discontinuity was around 14%</li>
<li>Discontinuities were not randomly distributed: some classes of metric, some times, and some types of event seem to make them more likely or more numerous. We mostly haven&#8217;t investigated these in depth.</li>
<li>Growth rates sharply changed in many trends, and this seemed strongly associated with discontinuities. (If you experience a discontinuity, it looks like there’s a good chance you’re hitting a new rate of progress, and should expect more of that.)</li>

For throughout the past and future, everyone has always died, and always will die, precisely 1.0 times (a contingent fact, but nonetheless the most accurately known physical constant in the universe, somehow). So nothing can increase the chance of dying (which is already 100%), and we all die eventually of something.</p><p>What seems bad, though, is when an illness causes <em>premature </em>death - dying too soon, before one&apos;s time. But when is that?</p><h2>Everyone dies prematurely</h2><p>Life expectancy tables report that at birth, in the UK (or US) you have a life expectancy of 81 years. So dying before 81 would be premature; if you died aged 20 or 50, people would say you&apos;d died young, before your time.</p><p>But when you get to 81, it&apos;s not your time either - for you then have a life expectancy of as much as 8.5 more years, living to 89.5. And if you reach 89.5 years, you can then expect to live on to 94, etc. Even at age 100 you have a life expectancy of 2.1 further years.</p><p>So whatever age you die at, your death is <em>always </em>premature - for your life expectancy at that age is invariably greater than the time you continue to live for (= 0 years).</p><p>Maybe this is part of the reason death seems like a raw deal. For however old you are when you die, you certainly <em>could </em>have lived longer (by at least a nanosecond). Because there is no upper limit for age: no age which you have a non-zero probability of reaching, but a zero probability of exceeding (another contingent fact about the universe we oddly seem to be certain of).</p><p>But the raw deal is even worse. Suppose you die at age <em>x</em>; and the life expectancy at that age is <em>e</em> further years. Then of all the people in the world aged <em>x</em>, you are the very first to die - for you die immediately, whereas they all continue living (for at least a nanosecond), and indeed on average they live <em>e</em> further years that you missed out on.</p><p>Moreover, all those who are younger than <em>x </em>also continue living, and even those older than <em>x </em>do too (for at least a nanosecond). So you not only died before everyone the same age as you, but also before everyone younger, and even everyone older! You&apos;re the unluckiest person alive! (Or at least, the unhealthiest.)</p><h2>No-one dies prematurely</h2><p>Perhaps the confusion is about the concept of life expectancy: <em>e </em>doesn&apos;t tell you how long <em>you </em>will live, but how long <em>people in general </em>aged <em>x</em> live, on average. So it&apos;s not personalized to your situation. The more we know about your health &amp; circumstances, the more we can improve on this estimate to make it specific to you. And if we knew everything about you, we could make an extremely accurate, perhaps even exact, tailored prediction.</p><p>So let&apos;s try it: at the age in question - <em>x</em> (your death) - your tailored prediction (which oddly we can make without knowing anything about you) is that your life expectancy is <em>precisely </em>0.0 years.</p><p>But then in what sense did you die prematurely? Given this actual, individual life expectancy, it&apos;s clear that you haven&apos;t missed out at all - even if you were aged only 20. You lived exactly the expected number of years, and died when your time came - not a nanosecond before, nor after.</p><p>So at first it looked like people <em>always </em>die prematurely; now it looks like they <em>never </em>do.</p><p>Is the confusion then just that we didn&apos;t know enough to make an individually tailored life expectancy prediction for you in advance, so rely instead on life expectancy tables? But they&apos;re so unreliable; when your time comes, why do the tables invariably <em>over</em>estimate? (No wonder death seems too soon!) Can&apos;t we just <em>correct </em>them?</p><hr class=""dividerBlock""><p>I&apos;m partly joking, but there seems to be a real paradox here. Is it a known one? Or more than one paradox? It feels a bit like <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno%27s_paradoxes"">one of Zeno&apos;s</a>; and also a bit like the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unexpected_hanging_paradox"">unexpected hanging/test</a>.</p><p>[added:] Also it feels like there may be a confusion between credence and chance (i.e. subjective &amp; objective probability) when calculating life expectancy, and/or confusion about the appropriate reference class of people.</p>",bfinn,bfinn,bfinn,
amAxFbmvFrdSLiF5F,The Unilateralist’s “Curse” Is Mostly Good,the-unilateralist-s-curse-is-mostly-good,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/amAxFbmvFrdSLiF5F/the-unilateralist-s-curse-is-mostly-good,2020-04-13T22:48:22.589Z,93,39,16,False,False,,"<p>People around here sometimes reference the &#x201C;Unilateralist&#x2019;s Curse&#x201D;, especially when they want to keep someone else from doing something that might cause harm. Briefly, the idea is that &#x201C;unilateral&#x201D; actions taken without the consent of society at large are especially likely to be harmful, because people who underestimate the resulting harm will be the most likely to take the action in question. </p><p>The canonical formulation of the argument is in <a href=""https://www.nickbostrom.com/papers/unilateralist.pdf"">a paper by Bostrom, Douglas, and Sandberg</a>, most recently updated in 2016. I highly recommend reading the &#x201C;Introduction&#x201D; and &#x201C;Discussion&#x201D; sections of the paper. (I found the toy mathematical models in the middle sections less useful.)</p><p>While the paper mostly gives arguments that unilateralism could be harmful and ought to be stopped via a &#x201C;principle of conformity&#x201D;, the authors concede that the historical record does not back this up: &#x201C;[I]f we &#x201C;backtest&#x201D; the principle on historical experience, it is not at all clear that universal adoption of the principle of conformity would have had a net positive effect. It seems that, quite often, what is now widely recognized as important progress was instigated by the unilateral actions of mavericks, dissidents, and visionaries who undertook initiatives that most of their contemporaries would have viewed with hostility and that existing institutions sought to suppress.&#x201D;</p><p>For example, an <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20190410204445/https://nickbostrom.com/papers/unilateralist.pdf"">older 2013 version of Bostrom et al&#x2019;s paper</a> notes that &#x201C;The principle of conformity could be seen to imply, for instance, that Galileo Galilei ought to have heeded the admonitions of the Catholic Church and ceased his efforts to investigate and promote the heliocentric theory.&#x201D; The 2016 update removes this and most of the discussion of unilateralism&#x2019;s importance to science, but retains the discussion of Daniel Ellsburg&#x2019;s decision to leak the Pentagon Papers to the media as an example of beneficial unilateralist action. A cursory glance through history finds many, many other examples of unilateralists having strong positive effects, from Stanislav Petrov to Oskar Schindler to Ignaz Semmelweis to Harriet Tubman.</p><p>Bostrom et al continue, &#x201C;The claim that the unilateralist curse is an important phenomenon and that we have reason to lift it <em>is consistent with the claim that the curse has provided a net benefit to humanity</em>. [Italics mine.] The main effect of the curse is to produce a tendency towards unilateral initiatives, and if it has historically been the case that there have been other factors that have tended to strongly inhibit unilateral initiatives, then it could be the case that the curse has had the net effect of moving the overall amount of unilateralism closer to the optimal level.&#x201D;</p><p>Obviously there are any number of &#x201C;factors that have tended to strongly inhibit unilateral initiatives&#x201D;, and not just historically. These continue today, and will last as long as the human condition persists. Examples include reflexive conformity a la <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asch_conformity_experiments"">Asch&#x2019;s experiments</a>; loyalty to friends, tribalism, and other <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/identity.html"">identity</a>-based sentiments; active punishment of dissenters via methods that range from execution to imprisonment and torture to civil lawsuits to &#x201C;merely&#x201D; withholding acclaim, funding, and opportunities for promotion; and most important of all, the sheer difficulty of figuring out better ways of doing things.</p><p>An undiscriminating &#x201C;principle of conformity&#x201D; would be just one more source of drag on progress across the board. In most areas, the benefits of unilateral action are far larger than the costs. In areas where particular caution is warranted, such as sharing weapons technology, the potential harms are widely understood and unilateral action by altruists is at most a minor factor. Advocates of inaction should rely on arguments about specific harms, not vague heuristics to buttress the natural human tendency towards deference.</p>",David Hornbein,david-hornbein,David Hornbein,

HPMOR and other rationalist media lionizes this sort of behavior and encourages people to try and fit into this archetype while looking down on people who don&apos;t. <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7FzD7pNm9X68Gp5ZC/why-our-kind-can-t-cooperate"">Why Our Kind Can&apos;t Cooperate </a>from the Craft and the Community sequence also points to the same general cluster of behavioral trends. I&apos;m not saying this is universal, but there does seem to be something to it. </p><p>I&apos;ve probably been influenced by this myself. Over the years I have collected a large pile of various failed or aborted projects in my wake. Things that just didn&apos;t work out or didn&apos;t go the way I had planned or hoped. As a result, it&apos;s become increasingly clear to me that I just don&apos;t make a very good Ender Wiggin. I&apos;m at least getting decent at <em>noticing </em>that I&apos;m not very good at this, but noticing my inability to discern good ideas from bad ones doesn&apos;t translate out into having better discernment. I <em>have </em>improved my discernment somewhat as I&#x2019;ve learned and aged, but I&#x2019;m still noticeably below average in this area.  </p><p>For problems where I can just throw lots of low-cost ideas at the wall and see what sticks, this is fine, but where there&#x2019;s a higher risk or cost associated with each attempt, it&#x2019;s much less so. I have a lot of strengths, but discernment will probably never be one of them and it seems wise to admit that and leave the discernment to people who are better equipped to do it.</p><p>I&apos;m not a very good Ender Wiggin, that just isn&apos;t where my strengths lie. But Ender couldn&#x2019;t have won the Formic War on his own, Ender needed Bean, and Petra, and all the other members of his Jeesh. I might not be a very good Ender, but I could be a good Bean. I&#x2019;m motivated, intelligent, value-aligned, and hardworking. With how many Enders there are in this community it seems like I should be able to find someone to work under.</p><p>A friend of mine questions whether this is actually describing a useful dynamic, or if my time would be better spent more time on personal improvement before trying to take actions that improve the world. I don&apos;t know if I agree with this and it seems like if I can make useful contributions now, it would be better for the world than if I waited. </p><p>So this question is really a few questions: </p><p>1) Is this a useful dynamic? If I can find someone to be the Samurai to their Daimyo, is that something which would be of benefit to the project of rationality? </p><p>2) If it is a useful dynamic, how might I go about finding someone to work under? </p><p>3) Am I, as a person, actually capable of making a positive difference in general or is my presence generally going to prove useless or detrimental? Is this something I can improve and if so, how? </p>",Hivewired,hivewired,Slimepriestess,

We both care a lot about certain policies and really want to change the other&#x2019;s mind, but whenever we try, it just ends in frustration. I&apos;ve spent a lot of time wondering why our arguments are so unproductive, and after much rumination and journaling about it, I have come up with the following list of helpful reminders. Now when he sends me something politically charged, or when I get the urge to do the same, I stop and read some of the items in the list.</p><p>In no special order, they are:</p><ul><li>People&apos;s beliefs fall along tribal lines, even when a large part of them really wants to do impartial truth-tracking.</li><li>Do they have any incentive to self-correct about this? Or do they have every incentive to avoid changing their mind?</li><li>When it comes to certain topics, humans will change their minds only slowly and gradually. For those topics it is silly to expect them to perform anything close to an ideal Bayesian update.</li><li>If I had a great need to impart some complex, easily-misunderstood technical problem to my friend, I would want to do so with focused attention and graph paper. I would not want to do it while we were out getting lunch nor while we were just idly texting. This is true for our political arguments as well, to the extent that technical problems are relevant.</li><li>Incorporating confirming evidence is effortless and often emotionally gratifying. In contrast, reading something that challenges my priors leaves me with a choice: summarily dismiss it...or [tired sigh]...fire up the cogitators and begin the arduous process of crux checking, fact checking, and so on.</li><li>It can be borderline impossible to say &quot;you are right and I was wrong&quot; to someone who is being smug, condescending, or mean to you; or who has a habit of making your tribe look bad.</li><li><a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/30/i-can-tolerate-anything-except-the-outgroup/"">I can tolerate anything except the outgroup.</a></li><li>People are not trained to gracefully admit to being wrong, even when it is best to do so. It feels extremely costly, and well...it often <em>is</em>.</li><li>Don&apos;t expect it to go well if you try to convince someone that they are the bad guy. Do <em>you</em> have a <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/3XgYbghWruBMrPTAL/leave-a-line-of-retreat"">line of retreat</a> for discovering something like that?

They can fully suppress the curiosity of even the most curious people.</li><li>Is changing their mind even worth it?</li><li>People often can&apos;t even think straight about how to improve their health, lifestyle, or relationships--domains in which the stakes are real and the results are constantly in view.</li><li><a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Politics_is_the_Mind-Killer"">Politics is war and arguments are soldiers</a>.

Let he who is without <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4RLfVxTGH4"">soldier mindset</a> cast the first stone.</li></ul><p>When I review this list, the initial impulse to argue with my friend is replaced by a patient desire to find something more productive to say. And often this newly reformed desire then evolves into a different desire: to simply table the topic until I&apos;ve become more informed (or just thought about it more).</p><p>This felt shift in desire has a familiar gestalt. There&apos;s probably a word for this but I don&apos;t know it. It reminds me of some sort of acceptance archetype--perhaps like the person who finally accepts that they aren&#x2019;t just getting unlucky over and over, but rather that there is an underlying issue they must fix before they have a chance of succeeding.</p><p>If I&apos;m actually serious about all this, then my next step is to set aside some blocks of focused time during which to: <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/3XgYbghWruBMrPTAL/leave-a-line-of-retreat"">leave a line of retreat</a>, see if I can find and correct any flagrant <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/EEv9JeuY5xfuDDSgF/flinching-away-from-truth-is-often-about-protecting-the"">bucket errors</a>, attack my arguments at their <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/dHQkDNMhj692ayx78/avoiding-your-belief-s-real-weak-points"">weak points</a>, and maybe also recite the <a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Litany_of_Tarski"">Litany of Tarsky</a> for good luck.

Those try and put an <em>absolute</em> limit on how much <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""V""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.186em;"">V</span></span></span></span></span></span> is optimised.

<p>Another approach is to put a <em>relative</em> limit on how much an AI can push a utility function. For example, <a href=""https://intelligence.org/files/QuantilizersSaferAlternative.pdf"">quantilizers</a> will choose randomly among the top <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""0< q \leq 1""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mn""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">0</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">&lt;</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.446em; padding-right: 0.014em;"">q</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.446em;"">≤</span></span><span class=""mjx-mn MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">1</span></span></span></span></span></span> proportion of actions/policies, rather than picking the top action/policy.

<p>So, in the first case, we need <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""q""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.446em; padding-right: 0.014em;"">q</span></span></span></span></span></span> above <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""0.3""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mn""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">0.3</span></span></span></span></span></span>, and, in the second, below <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""0.2""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mn""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">0.2</span></span></span></span></span></span>. And, moreover, it might be that the first situation appears in one world and the second in another, and both worlds are currently possible. So there's no consistent good value of <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""q""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.446em; padding-right: 0.014em;"">q</span></span></span></span></span></span> we can set (and in the general case, the curve might be multi-modal, with many peaks). And note that we don't know any of these graphs (since we can't define <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""U""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.084em;"">U</span></span></span></span></span></span> fully).

<p>The conservatism approach has similar problems: <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\beta""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.446em; padding-right: 0.007em;"">β</span></span></span></span></span></span> is even harder to interpret than <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""q""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.446em; padding-right: 0.014em;"">q</span></span></span></span></span></span>, we don't have any guidance on how to set it, and the ideal <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\beta""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.446em; padding-right: 0.007em;"">β</span></span></span></span></span></span> may vary considerably depending on the circumstance. For example, what would we want our AI to do when it finds an unexpected red button connected to nuclear weapons?</p>
<p><img src=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/3rmp89gc4ark2ne/red_button_robot.png?raw=1"" alt=""""></p>
<p>Well, that depends on whether the button starts a nuclear launch - or if it cancels one.</p>
<p>A future post will explore how to resolve this issue, and how to choose the conservatism parameter in a suitable way.</p>

I'll write something:

It only accepts letters, numbers, and a few punctuation marks.  As you
type it says the letters, and when you press enter it says your whole
sentence.  There's a history, but once something scrolls off the
bottom of the screen it's gone.

Some ways we'll play with it:

</p>

<p>

</p>

<ul>

<li>They'll ask me how to write something, I'll spell it.  I'll point
out the letters as needed, <a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/lessons-from-dropping-out"">as
vaguely as I can</a>.</li>

<li>I'll write something, they'll guess at it, then we press enter and
find out if they're right.</li>

<li>I'll write something, they'll copy it.</li>

<li>I'll write a word like 'SAD' and then they'll see if they can
modify it to make a related word like 'MAD'.</li>

</ul>



<p>

It uses upper-case and sans-serif because that's what the letters on
they keyboard look like.

I got the idea from Daniel's <a href=""https://3e.org/speak"">version</a>, but rewrote it from scratch
to better ignore mistaken inputs.  Feel free to copy and modify!

Some recent drama (that I won't link to) reminded me that there are large differences in how people answer that question.</p>

<p>(In the drama in question, this wasn't the only thing at issue. But it was a relevant question.)</p>

<p>I thought I'd take a stab at describing my best guess as to how we answer it <a href=""https://medium.com/@ThingMaker/in-my-culture-29c6464072b2"">in my culture</a>: in the culture that exists only in my mind, but that I think (and hope) many copies of me would implement, if we had that opportunity. (That culture doesn't attempt to exclude people who <em>aren't</em> copies of me, so it does need to be robust to attack. In my culture, we do not just assume in defiance of all evidence that everyone is friendly and trustworthy.)</p>

<p>Some of this will probably seem obvious to many readers, like ""in my culture, murder is considered bad"". Probably different bits to different readers. I'm interested in discovering which bits seem obvious to almost everyone, and which bits are controversial.</p>

<p>A lot of it follows from how I think about responsibility in general. But if you start to think ""extending this response to this other situation, you'd get this, and that's a terrible idea""… in my culture, we don't immediately assume from this that I'm endorsing a terrible idea. Instead we check. Maybe I <a href=""https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/6ntmpCvPDh3uhAi6j/the-sally-anne-fallacy"">disagree</a> that that's how it extends. Maybe I hadn't thought about this, and you can change my mind about the initial response. Maybe I just straightforwardly endorse a terrible idea: in that case, it'll be much easier to push back once you've gotten me to admit to it.</p>

<p>I do not intend, in this essay, to discuss whether any particular person or group is living up to the standards I outline here. I may do that <a href=""https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/Btdy7Fefer7S5J6qE/now-here-s-why-i-m-punching-you"">in future</a>. But how likely that is, and what that follow-up looks like, depends on whether the responses to this essay suggest a lot of people agree with my culture.</p>

<p>I think there are at least three important limitations to this essay. One is that I've never been a maintainer of an open source project that had users other than myself (that I knew of), though I've made small contributions to a few. As such, I don't really know what the experience is like or how my culture deals with its challenges, much like I don't really know how my culture deals with the challenges of living in Antarctica. I can make educated guesses, but that's all they are. I'm not going to explicitly flag them as such in the main body. (I'm already using the words ""in my culture, we…"" far too much. I'm not changing it to ""in my culture, my educated guess is that we…"") Ideally, I wouldn't write this essay because there was already a conversation taking place between people who knew what they were talking about. Unfortunately, as far as I've seen there mostly isn't, so I offer what I can.</p>

<p>Another is that I don't talk at all about the responsibilities of <em>users</em>, which is also an important part of the question. I'd like to, but… this essay has been knocking around in my head for at least a year and a half, I've made at least one previous attempt to write it that I gave up on, and I'm worried that if I don't publish it quickly I never will. I hope and believe that even with this omission, it is better for this essay to be published than to not be published.</p>

<p>(I also omit the question ""what is this responsibility thing anyway?"", but that seems less important to me right now. I've probably also overlooked important parts of the things I do talk about, but that too may not be a big deal.)</p>

<p>And a third is that without specific examples, what I've written is less constrained than what's in my head. It may well be possible to read this and agree with what I've written, and then to discover that your culture has a much stricter or much looser conception of responsibility than mine does.</p>

<p>With all of that out of the way: there are three questions I'm going to be focusing on here. When is responsibility taken on; what does it entail; and how do we react if people fail at it?</p>

<h3>When is responsibility taken on?</h3>

<p>In my culture, taking on responsibility requires active involvement, but not explicit consent. It's possible to take on responsibility through negligence - to draw responsibility towards yourself without realizing that's what you're doing. In my culture, we're sympathetic towards people who do that, but we don't consider that this absolves their responsibility.</p>

<p>In my culture, merely making something available does not make you responsible for it. If you want to put something online and ignore anyone who tries to use it, you can do that. You are allowed to <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10513328"">shithub</a>.</p>

<p>In my culture, you take on more responsibility for a project if…</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If you start <em>encouraging</em> people to use your project. If someone happens to stumble across a repository you never specifically shared, you have no responsibility for it. If you see them describe a problem they have, and you say ""oh hey, I had that problem too, you might want to check out my repo"" you have a little. If you create a website for your project where you describe it as ""the best way to solve this problem"", you have more.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you have <em>many</em> users. If you shirk your responsibilities, most of the harm done is to your users<sup><a href=""#fn:other-stakeholders"">1</a></sup>. With fewer users, the harm from not-acting-responsibly is lower, and so the responsibilities themselves are lower.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If your users are <em>invested</em> in your project. If they can't easily stop using it, you have more responsibility to treat them well.</p>

    <p>Your users' exit costs are probably low if you make a video game, or ""libpng but 30% faster"" or ""<code>find</code> but with a nicer command line syntax"". In that case your users can probably just play a different game, or easily replace your tool with libpng or <code>find</code>.</p>

    <p>They're higher if you make a programming language, where migrating away requires rewriting a codebase. Or a document editor that can only save in its native binary format or pdf, so that there's no way to edit the documents without your tool.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you have the <em>ability</em> to accept responsibility. Handling responsibility takes time and it takes multiple skill sets. One person hacking on their side project simply cannot act in the same ways as a team of two full-time developers plus twenty volunteers. That team can't act in the same ways as the Mozilla Foundation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you <em>act like</em> you're accepting responsibility. If you have a history of ignoring issues and pull requests, people should probably pick up on this. If you tell people you're going to break backwards compatibility, they shouldn't expect you to maintain it. Words like ""production ready"" increase your level of responsibility. Words like ""alpha"" decrease it, as do version numbers below 1.0.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>A common thread here is that responsibility is related to <em>justified expectations</em>. ""Expectations"" in both the moral sense and the probabilistic sense. If someone can make a compelling argument ""this person <em>morally ought to</em> accept responsibility here"", or a compelling argument ""I predict based on past behaviour that this person <em>will</em> act as though they've accepted responsibility here"", then in my culture, that person has some degree of responsibility whether they like it or not.</p>

<p>Accordingly, in my culture you can disclaim responsibility in advance, simply by <em>saying that you're doing this</em>. Note that a pro forma warranty disclaimer in your LICENSE file isn't sufficient here. Instead you should say it at the entry points to your project - probably the README and the website (if there is one). Something like…</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that while I think this project will be useful to many people, I am not devoting much attention to it, and I'm prioritizing my own use cases. Bugs may be fixed slowly if at all. Features may be removed without warning. If this isn't acceptable to you, you should probably not rely on the project; or at least you should be willing to fork it, if necessary.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or even:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that while I think this project will be useful to many people, I have no interest in accepting responsibility for other people's use of it. Feel free to submit issues and pull requests; but I may ignore them at whim, and my whim may be arbitrary and capricious.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This won't usually be necessary. But if you feel in danger of taking on more responsibility than you'd like, you can do this.</p>

<h3>If you have responsibility, what does that entail?</h3>

<p>In my culture, if we've taken on responsibility and now we want to discharge it, we do so with care. We give advance notice, and we try to find replacement maintainers. If we can't find a replacement maintainer, we still get to quit. But we try.</p>

<p>In my culture, we acknowledge that different people have different needs and goals, and not every project will be suitable for all users. We try to help users figure out whether our projects will be suitable for them before they get invested. We're open about the limitations of our projects, and about the design goals that we explicitly reject.</p>

<p>In my culture, we don't need to reply to every critic. But we do try to notice common threads in criticism, and address those threads. (""Address"" doesn't mean that we necessarily try to solve them in a way that will satisfy the critics. It simply means we give our thoughts about them. We try to do that in such a way that even if the critics aren't happy with what we're doing, they at least feel like we've heard them and understood them.)</p>

<p>In my culture, we accept that some critics will be unkind, unfair and unproductive. This sucks, but it's a reality of life right now. We distinguish these critics from others. We are free to ignore them, and to ban them and delete their posts from the spaces we control. We do not use their actions to justify shirking our responsibilities to other critics.</p>

<p>In my culture, we also take care to check whether we're unfairly rounding people off as being unkind, unfair and unproductive. We don't require perfection from our critics. We try to hold ourselves and our supporters to the standards we expect of our critics. We moderate our spaces, but we try not to silence all criticism from them.</p>

<p>In my culture, we still introduce bugs, because we're still human. We try not to, of course. But we accept fallibility. When we fail, we do our best to fix it. We put more effort into avoiding more catastrophic bugs.</p>

<p>In my culture, we do not accept incompetence or indifference. These are signs that a person should not have taken on responsibility in the first place. We expect people to know the limits of their ability and of how much they care.</p>

<p>In my culture, we can set boundaries around how our future actions are constrained. We distinguish public APIs (where we mostly try to maintain backwards compatibility) from private APIs (where we mostly don't, and if people expect us to we point to the word ""private""). We may reject bugfixes that we expect to cause too much ongoing future work, in hope of finding a better fix in future.</p>

<p>In my culture, sometimes we hurt people deliberately because the alternatives are worse. When we do, we own it. For example, sometimes we decide to remove a feature that people were relying on. We don't make that decision lightly. When we do it, we explain why we decided to do it, and we apologize to the people who were relying on it. We don't try to minimize their pain. We try to suggest alternatives, if we can; but we try not to pretend that those alternatives are any more suitable than they actually are. We give advance notice, if we can. We can be convinced to change our minds, if new information comes to light.</p>

<p>Of course, the degree to which we feel bound by all of this depends on the degree to which we've actually taken on responsibility. And note that in all of this, there's very little requirement for positive action. If we don't want to include a feature, we don't need to write it, or even merge the PR if someone else writes it. If we don't want to go in the direction our users want us to, we don't have to go there. We just have to make it clear that that's what we're doing.</p>

<h3>What if someone fails to act responsibly?</h3>

<p>That is, if someone has taken on responsibility, whether intentionally or not, and then has failed to act like someone who's taken on responsibility… how do we respond?</p>

<p>In my culture, we mostly respond by acting as though this will happen in future.</p>

<p>We don't treat this as an indelible black mark against all aspects of the person. We'll still accept their contributions to other open source projects, for example. (Though perhaps not technically complex contributions, that will likely need a lot of maintenance from the same person going forward.) We'll accept their conference talks. We'll stay friends with them.</p>

<p>But we won't rely on their projects, because we don't expect their projects to be reliable. We warn others about this, but if others decide to use their projects anyway, we consider that none of our business.</p>

<p>We accept that people have a right to run projects as they see fit. We acknowledge that our conception of ""responsibility"" is a mere social convention. But social conventions are important. We provide an opt-out for this particular social convention, but if you don't opt out <em>explicitly</em>, we'll make it explicit for you.</p>

<p>We give second chances. If they want to take on responsibility in future, and if they seem to understand how they failed in the past, and they say they'll try to do better, we give them a shot, because that's reason to think it won't happen in future. If they still fail, and want a third chance, we take their second failure into account too.</p>

<p>We may fork a project, even if the maintainer doesn't approve, but we'll rarely attempt a hostile takeover from the outside. We'll make sure our fork is clearly distinguished from the original project.</p>
<div>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>To the extent that this isn't true, I think most of the responsibility comes from something other than ""being an open source maintainer"". For example, if you're making a web scraper, I would suggest you have a responsibility to make it well-behaved by default - sleep between requests, stop after a certain number of failures, and so on. But that responsibility comes from the product, not the process. You can't avoid it with a disclaimer. And so it's not the focus of this essay. <a href=""#fnref:other-stakeholders"">↩</a></p>

To celebrate, I’ve been thinking about what I would have told myself in 2011 when I was deciding where to attend. Here’s a stitching-together of several emails I sent to friends who asked for college advice, plus a few additional thoughts.</p>
<p>As a caveat: I really do mean that this advice is for people who are <em>exactly like me</em>! So please don’t take my word for things—lots won’t apply to you because we’re different. As with all advice: think about it, see what resonates with you, consider <a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/03/24/should-you-reverse-any-advice-you-hear/"">reversing it</a>, and generally take it as one of many data points.</p>
<h2>Keep the goal in mind</h2>
<p>At the end of college you should probably have a good idea about what to do next.</p>
<p>Here’s the default way to figure that plan out: (1) don’t think about it for three years; (2) get really stressed during your senior year because you have no idea what you want to do; (3) notice that all your friends are interviewing for jobs in consulting, finance, and MicroFaceGoogAzon; (4) accept a job from consulting, finance, or MicroFaceGoogAzon.</p>
<p>This process… could stand to be improved. Plan ahead and don’t make a “safe” decision based on social defaults or fear of not having a job. The most important question to answer is “what kind of jobs exist that (a) I would enjoy and (b) I have a reasonable shot at getting?”</p>
<p>Yes, it is scary and stressful to stare this question (especially b!) in the face, but it should be a <em>lot</em> scarier to waste years doing something safe instead of something awesome.</p>
<p>That isn’t to say you need to know with any amount of certainty what you want to do. (That’s unreasonable and it will change anyway.) Just that it’s good if your choices during college are informed by <em>some</em> broad sense of what they’re setting you up for later. “Plans are useless; planning is indispensable.”</p>
<h2>Social environment &gt;&gt; classes</h2>
<p>The other useful thing to get out of college is a bunch of awesome, smart and competent friends. I’d recommend optimizing for that, probably more than educational quality or status.</p>
<p>Sub-points:</p>
<ul>
<li>On “density of people who are great at STEM,” my impression is that research universities score a lot better than small liberal arts colleges. I didn’t apply to Caltech, but by some (lagging) metrics it has an <a href=""https://infoproc.blogspot.com/2015/09/colleges-ranked-by-nobel-fields-turing.html"">even higher density of accomplished people</a> than other top schools.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Control over who you live with/near is a huge selling point, since it mostly determines your social circle. For example, Harvard assigns dorms to groups of upperclassmen randomly—you can pick your roommates but not the other roommate groups that you live near. This makes it hard to find the most awesome people because they’re mixed into boring groups. Other schools like MIT will often have dorms with different cultures and types of people, which makes it easier to find clusters of awesome people. For that reason, if I were choosing colleges today I might have prioritized schools with better housing policies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you go to a school with a strong subculture, make sure you retain your ability to interact well with “normal people.” The stereotype of, e.g., MIT alums that end up spending the rest of their life only hanging out with other MIT students, does happen to some people. It’s a reasonable personal choice (normal people can be annoying!), but if you’re optimizing for impact on the rest of the world, it will be a handicap.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Get better at deciding what to do</h2>
<p>One thing I wish I’d had more of in college is something like a sense of <em>taste</em>: not aesthetic taste, but more “taste for what’s awesome” or “taste in good projects.” (My role model for good project-taste was my friend <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Adrian_Veres"">Adrian</a>, who coauthored articles in <em>Nature</em>, <em>Science</em> and <em>Cell</em> before graduating.)</p>
<p>Good taste is what will guide you to doing effective things, instead of pointless things, in college. But it’s also really hard to <em>develop</em> good taste while in college, because you have no models of good taste except for academics. Academics’ taste is often deeply weird and driven by what niche will get them tenure rather than what is exciting or useful, so it’s good to have other models of taste too.</p>
<p>My best guess for how to do that is to take a gap year, during which you can front-load learning how the real world works. Summer internships outside academia are also good.<sup><a href=""#fn:1"">1</a></sup></p>
<h2>Take a gap year</h2>
<p>Yes, I just mentioned this above, but it’s concrete and important enough to merit its own section. I didn’t personally take a gap year, but everyone I know who took one found that it enormously improved how they used their time in college, and nobody regretted it.</p>
<p>If the point of a gap year is to improve how you spend your time in college, then you should spend it trying to learn as much as possible about how the world outside college works, and in particular, what that world considers valuable. Try to find projects that let you work with non-academics and produce something genuinely useful.</p>
<p>(It’s common for people to spend their gap years volunteering or traveling. A bit of that will expand your horizons, but spending the whole year on it, while fun, won’t maximize your learning.)</p>
<h2>Bias towards action</h2>
<p>One of the biggest new things about college is that you have way more independence. Because your parents no longer oversee your day-to-day life, it takes a lot less friction to do something random or unexpected.</p>
<p>Many college students take advantage of this by filling their schedule with (a) either parties or problem sets, plus (b) lunch dates where they complain about how busy they are. There are more exciting options! Here are some things I did that I think were more valuable on the margin than additional problem sets, even though a lot of them “didn’t work out:”</p>
<ul>
<li>interning at GiveWell (didn’t end up working there, but super valuable for exposure to various people/ideas)</li>
<li>running <a href=""http://www.harvardea.org/"">a student group</a> (I wasn’t very good at it but it turned out pretty well anyway)</li>
<li>trying out being a math teaching assistant (turned out the grading:fun ratio was way too high)</li>
<li>trying out research (couldn’t find projects I was excited about)</li>
<li>joining a choir (was incredibly fun but I dropped after a year because the schedule was intense)</li>
<li>writing a course catalog website (now unmaintained but was the first project I worked on from the beginning to shipping)</li>
<li>writing blog posts</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, the problem sets are also important! But if you discover you can’t live without them, well, you can have six more years of grad school for that. If you discover you can’t live without parties, I’m not your guy for advice.</p>
<h2>Get good advice</h2>
<p>Getting good advice is one of the highest-impact things you can do! A one-hour conversation with a good advice-giver can totally change how you spend months of your time. Most people underrate good advice by a lot.</p>
<p>This is because most advice is bad.<sup><a href=""#fn:2"">2</a></sup> For instance, if your college assigns you advisers they will probably be terrible.</p>
<p>My freshman year I was assigned a dental student as an adviser. I’m sure she was doing her best, but she had absolutely no idea how easy or hard any of the introductory courses were. (She could tell me things like “that course a reputation for being hard,” but students come in with such different backgrounds that “hard” in the abstract is a completely meaningless description.) Her only contribution to my education was to convince me not to take <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Math_55"">the hardest intro math course</a> during my first semester. I don’t think that made my life <em>that</em> much worse, but I do think I missed out on a great time!</p>
<p>My sophomore adviser would have been worse if I hadn’t learned my lesson by that time: when I handed her my study card she warned me that “introductory theoretical statistics” might ruin me, presumably because she hadn’t heard of algebraic topology. (There’s no reason she should have—she was studying education.) Fortunately, I successfully convinced her I’d be fine.</p>
<p>(Of course, the advice I really needed to hear was that <a href=""https://www.benkuhn.net/hard/"">“hard” and “important” aren’t related</a>, but that would have been way too much to ask for a 10-minute conversation slot!)</p>
<p>The problem is that by college, good advice is <em>incredibly</em> context-specific to you—what you enjoy, what frustrates you, what your background is like, what kind of goals you’re likely to have—that most formal advisers won’t ever have the time to understand.</p>
<p>Because of this, most of your best advice will probably come from bouncing things off friends—optimally friends who are a bit older than you, but people in your year are also probably better than random faculty. I think I under-utilized this a lot in college and would have benefited from reaching out more to people who I knew had a similar outlook.</p>
<p>(It’s possible to get good advice from authority figures at your college, but you’ll need to recognize their limitations and biases—no dental student will give you good advice about math courses, few professors will tell you that <a href=""https://www.benkuhn.net/grad/"">grad school sucks</a>, etc. If you treat them skeptically and do the work yourself to focus their advising on the areas where they’re well-informed, then you might have better luck than I did.)</p>
<h2>Aggressively ignore bullshit</h2>
<p>Coming in, you will probably think that your college experience has been carefully designed to provide you the best possible education. (HA HA HA.<sup><a href=""#fn:3"">3</a></sup>) As a result, when your college asks you to do things, you will feel inclined to take them seriously.</p>
<p>This is a mistake. Your college will spew lots of bullshit at you. Ignore it when you can; when you can’t, try to limit the degree to which it seeps into your life.</p>
<p>Examples of things that, in my opinion, turned out to be bullshit (of course this will vary by school, field, worldview, etc.):</p>
<ul>
<li>Physically attending lectures (just listen to them at 2x speed)</li>

<p>Lest this sound too cynical, let me point out that (a) college is still awesome and (b) ignoring bullshit gives you <em>crazy superpowers</em> to focus on the actually awesome parts, like spending time with smart people, learning difficult things, trying out different jobs and activities, etc.</p>

<p>I’ll close with some reasons you shouldn’t take this advice too seriously:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This advice is very specific to my background—not only educational but also cultural/economic—as well as my general outlook, life goals, etc. If you’re different from me on any of these axes it will become less relevant to you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was lucky to go to a very good high school, so I came into college with a very strong math/CS background already.<sup><a href=""#fn:4"">4</a></sup> As a result, I didn’t learn any concretely useful skills in college except for some statistics and machine learning (though I think some other classes I took improved my general problem-solving ability a lot). If you’re coming in with less background, the quality of instruction might matter more than it did for me.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I haven’t been out of school for that long: someone with 10-20 years more life experience would have a different perspective on what was valuable and what wasn’t. Unfortunately, I don’t know anyone in that age bracket who was similar enough to me that I think their advice would apply well.</li>

Previously:&#xA0;<a href=""https://grandunifiedcrazy.com/2019/02/18/narrative-dissonance/"">Narrative Dissonance</a>,</em> <em><a href=""https://grandunifiedcrazy.com/2019/04/20/where-the-narrative-stops/"">Where the Narrative Stops</a>, and</em> <em><a href=""https://grandunifiedcrazy.com/2019/10/26/narrative-distress-reinvention/"">Narrative Distress and&#xA0;Reinvention</a>.</em></p><p>In <em>Where the Narrative Stops</em> I briefly mentioned the hippie revolution as a rebellion against the standard narrative of the time. This idea combined in my brain a while ago with a few other ideas that had been floating around, and now I&#x2019;m finally getting around to writing about it. So let&#x2019;s talk about narrative rebellions.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve previously defined narratives as roughly &#x201C;the stories we tell about ourselves and others that help us make sense of the world&#x201D;. As explored previously in the series, these stories provide us with two things critical for our lives and happiness: a sense of purposeful direction, and a set of default templates for making decisions. So what happens when an individual or a demographic group chooses to rebel against the narrative of the day? It depends.</p><p>Rebellions are naturally framed in the negative: you rebel <em>against</em> something. With a little work you can manage to frame them positively, as in &#x201C;fighting for a cause&#x201D;, but the negative framing comes more naturally because it&#x2019;s more reflective of reality. While some rebellions are kicked off by a positive vision, the vast majority are reactionary; the current system doesn&#x2019;t work, so let&#x2019;s destroy it. Even when there is a nominally positive vision (as in the Russian Revolution, which could be framed as a &#x201C;positive&#x201D; rebellion towards communism) there is usually also a negative aspect intermingled (the existing Russian army was already ready to mutiny <em>against</em> Russia&#x2019;s participation in the First World War) and it can be difficult to disentangle the different causes.</p><p>In this way, narrative and socio-cultural rebellions are not that different from militaristic and geo-political ones. You can sometimes attach a positive framing, but the negative framing is both default, and usually dominant.</p><p>We&#x2019;ll come back to that. For the moment let&#x2019;s take a quick side-trip to Stephen Covey&#x2019;s <a href=""https://grandunifiedcrazy.com/2017/08/12/authentic-service-and-self-improvement/"">Principle-centered Leadership</a>. One of the metaphors he uses in that book (which I didn&#x2019;t actually include in my post about it, unfortunately) is the idea of a compass and a map. Maps can be a great tool to help you navigate, but Covey really hammers on the fact that it&#x2019;s better to have a compass. Maps can be badly misleading if the mapmaker left off a particular piece of information you&#x2019;re interested in; they can also simply go stale as the landscape shifts over time. A compass on the other hand (meaning your principles, in Covey&#x2019;s metaphor), always points due North, and is a far more reliable navigational tool.</p><p>This navigational metaphor is really useful when extended for talking about narratives and rebellions. One of the most important things a narrative gives us is that &#x201C;sense of purposeful direction&#x201D; which carries us through life. Without it, as in <em>Where the Narrative Stops</em>, narratives tend to peter out after a while or even stop abruptly on a final event (the way a &#x201C;student&#x201D; narrative may stop on graduation if you don&#x2019;t know what you actually want to do with the degree).</p><p>The problem is that rebelling against a narrative doesn&#x2019;t automatically generate a fully-defined counter-narrative (roughly analogous to how <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/qNZM3EGoE5ZeMdCRt/reversed-stupidity-is-not-intelligence"">reversed stupidity isn&#x2019;t intelligence</a>). If you don&#x2019;t like the direction things are going, you can turn around and walk the other way. But there&#x2019;s no guarantee the other way actually goes anywhere, and in fact it usually doesn&#x2019;t; a random walk through idea-space is very unlikely to generate a coherent story. Even when you have a specific counter-narrative in mind, there&#x2019;s good odds it still doesn&#x2019;t actually <em>work</em>. See again the Russian Revolution for an example; they ended up with a strong positive vision for communism, but that vision ultimately collapsed under the weight of economic and political realities.</p><p>This lack of destination seems to me the likely candidate for why the hippie rebellion petered out. They had a strong disagreement with the status quo, and chose to walk in the direction of &#x201C;free love&#x201D;, and similar principles instead. But this new direction mostly failed to translate into a coherent positive vision, and even when it did that vision didn&#x2019;t work. Most stories I&#x2019;ve been able to find of concrete hippie-narrative experiments end up sounding a lot like the Russian revolution; they ultimately collapse under the weight of reality.</p><p>Given the high cost of a rebellion, be it individual or societal, militaristic or narrative, it seems prudent to set yourself up for success as much as possible before-hand. In practice, this seems to mean having a concrete positive vision with strong evidence that it will actually work in reality. Otherwise tearing down the system will just leave you with rubble.</p>",,,,

Suppose our goal is to predict a system's future behaviour with minimum possible error given by some metric (e.g. minimise the mean square error or maximise the likelihood). This seems like something we would want to do in an optimal way, and also something a superintelligence should have a strategy to do, so I thought I'd ask here if anyone has worked on this problem.</p>
<p>I've read quite a bit about how we can optimally try to deduce the truth e.g. apply Bayes' theorem with a prior set following Ockham's razor (c.f. Solomonoff induction). However, this seems difficult to me to apply to modelling complex systems, even as an idealisation, because:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Since we cannot afford to model the true equations, every member of the set of models available to us is false, so the likelihood and posterior probability for each will typically evaluate to zero given enough observed data. So if we want to use Bayes' theorem, the probabilities should not mean the probability of each model being true. But it's not clear to me what they should mean - perhaps the probability that each model will give the prediction with the lowest error? But then it's not clear how to do updating, if the normal likelihoods will typically be zero.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It doesn't seem clear that Ockham's razor will be a good guide to giving our models prior probabilities. Its use seems to be motivated by it working well for deducing fundamental laws of nature. However, for modelling complex systems it seems more reasonable to me to give more weight to models that incorporate what we understand to be the important processes - and past observations can't necessarily help us tell what processes are important to include, because different processes may become important in future (c.f. biological feedbacks that may kick in as the climate warms). This could perhaps be done by having a strategy for deriving approximate affordable models from the fundamental laws - but is it possible to say anything about how an agent should do this?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I've not found anything about rational strategies to approximately model complex systems rather than derive true models. Thank you very much for any thoughts and resources you can share.</p>

</ul>



<p>

Let's set aside for the moment whether these are accurate, [1] does
this kind of thing work?  These are all cases where at the current
price there are many more people who want the thing than people who
can supply the thing.  In normal times the price would rise until
these balanced, but in emergencies our society has chosen <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_gouging"">not to allow
that</a>.  Let's say you're considering buying store-brand kidney beans, a
WIC-eligible item, the last one on the shelf.  If you choose not
to buy it, what happens?

</p>

<p>

One possibility is that it stays on the shelf until someone who can
only buy the store brand of kidney beans comes along, and they're able to buy
it.  Another is that someone who doesn't know to look for the WIC
symbol comes along, and they buy it instead.

</p>

<p>

There are about <a href=""https://www.fns.usda.gov/wic/frequently-asked-questions-about-wic"">7M</a>
people covered by WIC in the US, out of a population of 330M, so 1 in
50 shoppers is a decent estimate for what fraction care about the WIC
status of items.  This means that whether leaving it for someone else
is likely to work depends enormously on whether you expect most of
society to be going along with it.  If it's just you and a few other
scrupulous people, probably someone else who isn't on WIC buys the
kidney beans, while if nearly everyone is doing this then it probably works.

</p>

<p>

The thing is, though, getting everyone on board with one of these,
distributing the message widely so that everyone hears it, explaining
the details of why it matters so people agree and go along with it, is
really hard!  And pretty much all the time, instead of putting out
calls for individuals to leave things for others it makes more sense
for sellers to apply restrictions.  For example, UK supermarkets have
been trying to <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/25/supermarkets-use-database-to-prioritise-deliveries-to-elderly"">restrict
delivery to vulnerable people</a> and US supermarkets have been
designating hours for <a href=""http://newsroom.meijer.com/2020-03-19-Meijer-Announces-New-Store-Hours-and-Dedicated-Times-for-Seniors-Customers-with-Chronic-Health-Conditions-Essential-Service-Workers-and-Team-Members"">vulnerable
people and essential workers</a>.

</p>

<p>

Avoiding things in the hope that someone who especially needs them
will be able to get them instead usually won't work, and isn't a very
good <a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/effective-altruism-and-everyday-decisions"">altruistic
tradeoff</a>.  If you do want to improve distribution in situations
like this, encouraging sellers to prioritize is likely much more
valuable.  Alternatively, look for ways to shift demand to other
things and <a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/organizing-a-group-buy-of-flour"">work around
the shortage</a>.

</p>

<p>
<br />

[1] For example, in MA distribution of EBT is <a href=""https://www.mass.gov/guides/using-your-ebt-card#-know-when-your-benefits-are-available-"">staggered
throughout the month</a>, but ""don't buy on 4/1"" was still going around 
in local groups here.

<hr>
<p>Older Chinese characters tend to be simpler. You can use this to measure the relative ages of ancient concepts.</p>
<p>For example, the Chinese characters for colors are:</p>
<ul>
<li>白 white</li>
<li>黑 black</li>
<li>红 red</li>
<li>橙 orange</li>
<li>黄 yellow</li>
<li>绿 green</li>
<li>蓝 blue</li>
<li>紫 purple</li>
</ul>
<p>The simplest characters are written with a single radical. The oldest radicals are all Kangxi radicals. White 白, black 黑 and yellow 黄 are all written with a single Kangxi radical. The other colors contain at least two radicals.</p>
<p>This fits almost perfectly with Lazarus Geiger’s evolutionary progression<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-bwXeQe9djdzRAEGTE-1"" id=""fnref-bwXeQe9djdzRAEGTE-1"">[1]</a></sup> which goes black and white ➝ red ➝ yellow ➝ green ➝ blue. The only color out-of-place is red 红.</p>
<p>Wait a minute...I can't recall ever encountering the character ""红"" in ancient Chinese poetry.</p>
<p>That's because ""红"" is a relatively new character for the word ""red"". The traditional <a href=""https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E4%BA%94%E5%BD%A9"">five colors</a> 青黄赤白黑 use the Kangxi radical ""赤"" for red instead of ""红"". Mystery solved!</p>
<p>If we use the ancient character ""赤"" for red instead of the modern character ""红"" then the first four colors in Geiger's sequence are all simple Kangxi radicals and the rest are all composite characters with at least two radicals.</p>
<h1>Blue-Green</h1>
<p>It gets better. Did you notice how we've only used four of the five colors so far? Take a closer look at the five colors 青黄赤白黑. They include <em>qīng</em> 青, the color of nature, spanning blue and green. It is the 5th and 6th color in Geiger's progression. <em>Qīng</em> 青 is written with a single Kangxi radical.</p>
<p>If all you have are black, white, red and yellow, and then creating a single new color for blue and green is not unusual.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bastian also argued that Tagalog speakers in the Philippines had not even distinguished between green and blue until the arrival of the Spanish colonizers, because the Tagalog words for “green” and “blue” were clearly recent borrowings from Spanish <em>verde</em> and <em>azul</em>. And he claimed that the language of the Teda tribe in Chad still did not distinguish green from blue at all</p>
<p>― <em>Through the Looking Glass: Why the World Looks Different in Other Languages</em> by Guy Deutscher</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Today, <em>qīng</em> 青 is used in more poetic contexts while green 绿 and blue 蓝 are used in less poetic contexts.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>In this post I review the 2010 book “<a href=""http://www.lifecycleinvesting.net/"">Lifecycle Investing</a>” by Ian Ayres and Barry Nalebuff. (<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003GYEGK2/"">Amazon link here</a>; no commission received.)  They argue that a large subset of investors should adopt a (currently) unconventional strategy: One’s future retirement contributions should effectively be treated as bonds in one’s retirement portfolio that cannot be efficiently sold; therefore, early in life one should balance these low-volatility assets by gaining exposure to volatile high-return equities that will generically exceed 100% of one’s liquid retirement assets, necessitating some form of borrowing. </p>
<p>“Lifecycle Investing” was recommended to me by a friend who said the book “is extremely worth reading…like learning about index funds for the first time…Like worth paying &gt;1% of your lifetime income to read if that was needed to get access to the ideas…potentially a lot more”.  Ayres and Nalebuff lived up to this recommendation.  Eventually, I expect the basic ideas, which are simple, to become so widespread and obvious that it will be hard to remember that it required an insight.  </p>
<p>In part, what makes the main argument so compelling is that (as shown in the next section), it is closely related to an elegant explanation for something we all knew to be true — you should increase the bond-stock ratio of your portfolio as you get older — yet previously had bad justifications for.  It also gives new actionable, non-obvious, and potentially very important advice (buy equities on margin when young) that is appropriately tempered by real-world frictions. And, most importantly, it means I personally feel less bad about already being nearly 100% in stocks when I picked up the book.</p>
<p>My main concerns, which are shared by other reviewers and which are only partially addressed by the authors, are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Future income streams might be more like stocks than bonds for the large majority of people.
</li>
<li>
Implementing a safe buy-and-hold leveraged strategy in the real world could be even more of a headache, and incur more hidden costs, than the authors suppose.
</li>
<li>
If interest rates go up enough and expected stock returns go down enough, the whole thing could be rendered moot.
</li>
</ul>
<p>By far the best review of this book I’ve found after a bit of Googling is the one by Fredrick Vars, a law professor at the University of Alabama: <a href=""https://lawreview.vermontlaw.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/14-Vars-Book-2-Vol.-36.pdf"">[PDF]</a>.  Read that.  I wrote most of my review before Vars, and he anticipated almost all of my concerns while offering illuminating details on some of the legal aspects.</p>
<h3>A key puzzle</h3>
<p>One way to frame the insight, slightly different than as presented in the book, is as arising out of a solution to a basic puzzle.</p>
<p>The vast majority of financial advisors agree that retirement investments should have a higher percentage of volatile assets (stocks, essentially) when the person is young and less when they are old.  This is often justified by the argument that volatile returns can be averaged out over the years, but, taken naively, this is flat out wrong.  As <a href=""https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2014/07/average-stock-market-returns-arent-average.html"">Alex Tabarrok</a> puts it<span style=""display: none"">I have edited the broken link for “fallacy of time diversification” to point to an archived version of the web page.</span><a class=""fn-ref-mark"" href=""#footnote-6"" id=""refmark-6""><sup killerfootnote=""""><b><big>a&thinsp;&thinsp;</big></b></sup></a></p>
<blockquote><p>
Many people think that uncertainty washes out when you buy and hold for a long period of time. Not so, that is the <a href=""http://archive.is/4tn2c"">fallacy of time diversification</a>. Although the average return becomes more certain with more periods you don’t get the average return you get the total payoff and that becomes more uncertain with more periods.

<p>Sometimes when confronted with this mathematical reality people backtrack to a justification like this: If you are young and you take a large downturn, you can adapt to this by absorbing the loss over many years of slightly smaller future consumption (adaptation), but if you are older you must drastically cut back, so the hit to your utility is larger.  This is a true but fairly minor consideration.  Even if we knew we would be unable to adapt our consumption (say because it was dominated by fixed costs), it would <i>still</i> be much better to be long on stocks when young and less when old.</p>
<p>Another response is to point out that, although absolute uncertainty in stock performance goes up over time, the odds of beating bonds <em>also</em> keeps going up.  That is, on any given day the odds that stocks outperform bonds is maybe only a bit better than a coin flip, but as the time horizon grows, the odds get progressively better.<span style=""display: none"">I thank Will Riedel for this compelling phrasing.</span><a class=""fn-ref-mark"" href=""#footnote-23"" id=""refmark-23""><sup killerfootnote=""""><b><big>c&thinsp;&thinsp;</big></b></sup></a>  This is true, but some thought shows it’s not a good argument.&nbsp; In short, even if the chance of doing worse than bonds keeps falling, the distribution of scenarios where you lose to bonds could get more and more extreme; when you do worse, maybe you do <em>much</em>&nbsp;worse.  (For an extensive explanation, see the section “Probability of Shortfall” in the John Norstad’s “<a href=""http://archive.is/4tn2c#selection-355.0-355.24"">Risk and Time</a>“, which Tabarrok above linked to as “fallacy of time diversification”.)  This, it turns out, is not true — we see below that stocks do in fact get safer over time — but the possibility of extreme distributions shows why the probability-of-beating-bonds-goes-up-over-time argument is unsound.</p>
<h3>Puzzle resolution</h3>
<p>To neatly resolve this puzzle, the authors make a strong simplifying assumption.  (Importantly, the main idea is robust to relaxing this assumption somewhat,<span style=""display: none"">Although the authors don’t quantitatively explore this enough. See criticisms below.</span><a class=""fn-ref-mark"" href=""#footnote-5"" id=""refmark-5""><sup killerfootnote=""""><b><big>d&thinsp;&thinsp;</big></b></sup></a> but for now let’s accept it in its idealized form.)</p>
<p>The main assumption is that the portion of your future income that you will be saving for retirement (e.g., your stream of future 401(k) contributions) can be predicted with relative confidence and are financially equivalent to today holding a sequence of bonds that pay off on a regular schedule in the future (but cannot be sold).  <b>When we consider how our retirement portfolio today should be split between bonds and stocks, we should include the net present value of our future contributions.</b>  That is the main idea.</p>
<p>Under some not-unreasonable simplifying assumptions, Samuelson and Merton showed long ago<span style=""display: none"">Looks like Merton’s version of the problem is the most well known. Here are the references taken directly from the book: “Paul A.. Samuelson, “Lifetime Portfolio Selection by Dynamic Stochastic Programming,” Review of Economics and Statistics 51 (1969): 239-246; Robert Merton, “Lifetime Portfolio Selection Under Uncertainty: The Continuous-Time Case,” Review of Economics and Statistics 51 (1969): 247-257; and Robert Merton, “Optimum Consumption and Portfolio Rules in a Continuous Time Model,” Journal of Economic Theory 3 (1971): 373-413.”</span><a class=""fn-ref-mark"" href=""#footnote-7"" id=""refmark-7""><sup killerfootnote=""""><b><big>e&thinsp;&thinsp;</big></b></sup></a> that if, counterfactually, you had to live off an initial lump sum of wealth, then the optimal way to invest that sum would be to <i>maintain a constant split</i> between assets of different volatility (e.g., 40% stocks and 60% bonds), with the appropriate split determined by your personal risk tolerance.  However, even though you won’t magically receive your future retirement contributions as a lump sum in real life, it follows that if those contributions were perfectly predictable, and if you could borrow money at the risk-free rate, then you should borrow against your future contributions, converting them to their net present value, and <i>keep the same constant fraction of the money in the stock market</i>.  Starting today.</p>
<p>Crucially, when you are young your liquid retirement portfolio (the sum of your meager contribution up to that point, plus a bit of accumulated interest) is dwarfed by your expected future contributions.  Even if you invest 100% of your retirement account into stocks you are insufficiently exposed to the stock market.  In order to get sufficient stock exposure, you should borrow lots of money at the risk-free rate and put it in the stock market.  It is only as you get older, when the ratio between your retirement account and the present value of future earnings increases, that you should move more and more of your (visible) retirement account into regular bonds.  </p>
<p>The resolution of the puzzle is that the optimal portfolio (in the idealized case) only <i>looks</i> like it’s stock-heavy early in life because you’re forgetting about your stream of future retirement contributions (a portion of your future salary), which, the authors claim, is essentially like a bond that can’t be traded.</p>
<p>(If the above concept isn’t immediately compelling to you, my introduction has failed.  Close this blog and just go read the first couple chapters of their book.)</p>
<h3>But what about practicalities?</h3>
<p>Most of the book is devoted to fleshing out and defending the implications of this idea for the real world where there are a variety of complications, most notably that you cannot borrow unlimited amounts at the risk-free rate.  Nevertheless, the authors conclude that when many people are young they should buy equities on margin (i.e., with borrowed money) up to 2:1 leverage, at least if they have access to low enough interests rates to make it worthwhile. </p>
<p>The organization of chapters are as follows:</p>

</ol>
<p>In general the authors compare their lifecycle investing strategy to two conventional strategies: the “birthday rule” (aka an “<a href=""https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=255850"">age-in-bonds rule</a>“), where the investor allocates a percentage of their portfolio to stocks given by 100 (or 110) minus their age, and the “constant percentage rule”, where the investor keeps a constant fraction of their portfolio in stocks.</p>
<p>In Chapter 3, the authors argue that the lifecycle strategy consistently beats conventional strategies when (a) holding fixed expected return and minimizing variance, (b) holding fixed variance and maximizing expected return, (c) holding fixed very bad (first percentile) returns while maximizing expected return.  If you look at a hypothetical ensemble of investors on historical data, one retiring during each year between 1914 and 2010 (when the book was published), every single investor would have been had more at retirement by adopting the lifecycle strategy, and generally by an enormous 50% or more.  Here’s the total return of the investors vs. retirement year depending on whether they following a lifecycle strategy, birthday rule, or the constant percentage rule:</p>

<p>Although they rely on historical simulations for this, it’s really grounded in a very simple theoretical idea: your liquid retirement portfolio is extremely small when you’re young, so for any plausible level of risk aversion, you are better off leveraging equities initially.</p>
<p>Chapter 4 considers more testing variations: international stocks returns, Monte Carlo simulations with historically anomalous stock performance, higher interest rates, etc.  They also show the strategy can easily be modified to incorporate (possibly EMH-violating) beliefs about one’s ability to time the market.  (The authors use  Robert Shiller’s theory of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclically_adjusted_price-to-earnings_ratio"">cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio</a>, which they neither endorse nor reject.) </p>
<p>In Chapter 7, the authors draw on the work of Samuelson and Merton to address the key question: what is the constant fraction in stocks that you should be targeting anyways?  Assuming assumptions, the optimal “Samuelson share” to have invested in stocks is </p>

<p>The authors give reasons to be wary of taking this formula too seriously, especially because it’s not so easy to know what <img src=""https://blog.jessriedel.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-301adcc1d150a2d4399ae6cb2f0c5d45_l3.svg"" class=""ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format"" alt=""R"" title=""Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com"" height=""11"" width=""11"" style=""vertical-align: 0px;""> you should choose (discussed more below).  However, it is very notable that as equity volatility increases — say, because the world is <a href=""https://www.barrons.com/articles/vix-the-fear-gauge-coronavirus-slams-stocks-51582913166"">gripped by a global pandemic</a> — the appropriate amount of the portfolio to have exposed to the stock market drops drastically.  The authors suggest using the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VIX"">VIX</a> to estimate the equity volatility, and appropriately rebalancing your portfolio when that metric changes.  Continuously hitting the correct Samuelson share without shooting yourself in the foot looks hard, in practice, which the authors admit.  Still, there is so much to gain from leverage that it’s very likely you can collect a good chunk of the upside even with a conservative and careful approach.</p>
<h3>Criticism</h3>
<h4>Risk tolerance intuition</h4>
<p>The first general point of caution tempers (but definitely does not eliminate) the suggestion to invest in equities on margin: one’s risk tolerance is not an easy thing to elicit. To a large extent we do this by imagining various outcomes, deciding which outcomes we would prefer, and then inferring (with regularity assumptions) what our risk tolerance must be. Therefore, it would likely be a mistake to immediately take whatever risk tolerance you previously thought you had <i>as deployed in conventional investment strategies</i>  and then follow the advice in this book. After introspection, I’ve sorta decided that although I am still less risk averse than the general population, I’m more risk averse than I thought because I was following the intuition (which I can now justify better) that I should be heavy in stocks at my age.  The authors address the general difficulty of someone identifying their own risk tolerance (e.g., how dependent it is on framing effects), but they do not discuss how your beliefs about your risk tolerance might be entangled with what investment strategy you have previously been using.</p>
<p>However, this bears repeating: For every level of risk tolerance, there exists a form of this strategy that beats (both in expectation and risk) the best conventional strategy. The fact that, when young, you are buying stocks on margin makes it tempting to interpret this strategy is only good when one is not very risk averse or when the stock market has a good century.  But for any time-homogeneous view you have on what stocks will do in the future, there is a version of this strategy that is better than a conventional strategy. (A large fraction of casual critics seem to miss this point.)  The authors muddy this central feature a bit because, on my reading, they are a bit less risk averse than the average person.  The book would have been more pointed if they had erred toward risk aversion in their various examples of the lifecycle strategy.</p>
<h4>Retirement as a rainy day fund</h4>
<p>The second point of caution is gestured at in the <a href=""https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=274390#p4411923"">criticism by Nobel winner Paul Samuelson</a><span style=""display: none"">Ayers replies here.</span><a class=""fn-ref-mark"" href=""#footnote-1"" id=""refmark-1""><sup killerfootnote=""""><b><big>f&thinsp;&thinsp;</big></b></sup></a>.  (He was also a mentor of the authors.)   The costs of going <i>truly</i> bust would be catastrophic:   </p>
<blockquote><p>
The ideas that I have been criticizing do not shrivel up and die. They always come back… Recently I received an abstract for a paper in which a Yale economist and a Yale law school professor advise the world that when you are young and you have many years ahead of you, you should borrow heavily, invest in stocks on margin, and make a lot of money. I want to remind them, with a well-chosen counterexample: I always quote from Warren Buffett (that wise, wise man from Nebraska) that in order to succeed, you must first survive. People who leverage heavily when they are very young do not realize that the sky is the limit of what they could lose and from that point on, they would be knocked out of the game.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The authors respond to these sorts of concerns by emphasizing that (1) the risk of losing everything is highest when you are very young, which is exactly when the amount you have in your retirement account is very small, and (2) they are recommending adding leverage to your retirement account, not all your assets.  If you expect the total of your retirement contributions to be roughly $1 million by the time you retire, losing $20,000 and zeroing out your retirement account when you are 25 is not catastrophic (and is still a rare outcome under their strategy).  You should still have a rainy day fund, and you’ll just earn more money in the future.</p>
<p>However, I don’t think this response seriously grapples with the best concrete form of the wary intuition many people have to their strategy.  I think the main problem is that most people are implicitly using their retirement account not just as a place to save for retirement assuming a normal healthy life, but also as a rainy day fund for a variety of bad events. In the US, 12% of people are disabled; I don’t know how much you can push down those odds knowing you are healthy at a given time, but it seems like you need to allow for a ~3% chance you are partially or totally disabled at some point.  Although people buy disability insurance, they also know that if they ever needed to tap into their retirement account they could, possibly with a modest tax penalty.  (Likewise for other unforeseen crises.)  </p>
<p>Another way to say this: your future earning are substantially more likely to fail than the US government, so they cannot be idealized as a bond.  By purchasing the right insurance, keeping enough in savings account, etc., I’m sure there’s a way to hedge against this, and I’m confident the core ideas in this book survive this necessary hedging.  But I would have liked the authors to discuss how to do that in <i>at least</i> as much concrete detail as they describe the mechanics of how to invest on margin.<span style=""display: none"">Indeed, I suspect that many of the valid criticisms of their strategy apply almost as well to conventional investment strategies.  For example, many of us should probably have more disability insurance; if you lost the ability to work when you were 30, would things work out OK?  The lack of leverage in a conventional portfolio, combined with the fact that the stock market is quite unlikely to lose more than, say, 60%, means that the conventional portfolio naturally includes some weak coverage of bad scenarios.   But this is essentially accidental, and very unlikely to be optimal.</span><a class=""fn-ref-mark"" href=""#footnote-2"" id=""refmark-2""><sup killerfootnote=""""><b><big>g&thinsp;&thinsp;</big></b></sup></a>  If people have been relying on the conventional strategy and have consequently been implicitly enjoying a form of buffer/insurance, it is paramount to highlight this and find a substitute before moving on to an unconventional strategy that lacks that buffer.</p>
<p>Now, if we only had to insure against tail risks, that would be fine, but there is an extreme version of this issue that has the potential to undermine the entire idea: why is my future income stream like a bond rather than a stock?  I have a ton of uncertainty about how my income will increase in the future.  Indeed, personally, I think I trust the steady growth of the stock market more!  The authors do advise against adopting their strategy if your future income stream is highly correlated with the market (e.g., you’re a banker), but they don’t get very quantitative, and they don’t say much about what do if that stream is highly volatile but not very correlated with stocks.  (Sure, if it’s uncorrelated then you’re want to match your “investment” in your future income stream with some actual investment in stocks for diversification, but how much should this overall high volatility change the strategy?<span style=""display: none"">The author mention in passing that their friend Moshe Milevsy has written an entire book on the question: “Are You a Stock or a Bond?”.  But as their entire strategy hinges on this question, they should have addressed it much more deeply themselves.</span><a class=""fn-ref-mark"" href=""#footnote-4"" id=""refmark-4""><sup killerfootnote=""""><b><big>h&thinsp;&thinsp;</big></b></sup></a>)</p>
<h3>So did I immediately go out and lever my portfolio, or what?</h3>
<p>It will take some time before I have mulled this around enough to even start assessing whether I should be investing with significant leverage. It seems pretty plausible to me that my future income is much more uncertain than a bond, although that’s something I’ll need to meditate on.</p>
<p>I, like the authors, really wish there was a mutual fund that automatically implemented this strategy, like <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_date_fund"">target-date funds</a> do for (strategies similar to) the birthday rule. At the very least it would induce pointed discussion about the benefits and risks of the strategy.  Unfortunately, a decade after this book was released there is no such option and, as the authors admit in the book, concretely implementing the strategy yourself in the real world can be a headache.</p>
<p>However, because of this book I can at least feel less guilty for being overwhelmingly in equities.  After finishing this book I finally exchanged much of my remaining Vanguard 2050 target-date funds, which contain bonds, for pure equity index funds.  I had been keeping them around in part because going 100% equities felt vaguely dangerous. Now that there is a good argument that the optimal allocation is <i>greater</i> than 100% equities — though that is by no means assured — this no longer feels so extreme. Crossing the 100% barrier by acquiring leverage involves many real-world complications, but in the platonic realm there is nothing special about the divide.</p>

<p><span>Epistemic Status: </span><a href=""https://xkcd.com/386/""><span>Something Is Wrong On The Internet.</span></a> Which should almost always be ignored even when you are an expert, and I am nothing of the kind. Thus, despite this seeming like a necessary exception, I expect to regret writing this.</p>
<p><span>People are taking the projection of 60,000 American deaths from Covid-19 as if it were a real prediction. This number is being used to make policy, to deny states medical equipment and to make plans that spend trillions of dollars and when to plan to reopen entire economies. </span></p>
<p><span>Ignoring this in the hopes it will go away does not seem reasonable.</span></p>
<p><span>My suspicions that this was necessary were more than confirmed when, failing to realize just how obvious the nonsense in question was and thinking I needed to justify labeling it nonsense, I wrote a reference post called</span><a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2020/04/10/the-one-mistake-rule/""> <span>The One Mistake Rule.</span></a><span> </span></p>
<p><span>The second comment on that post </span><i><span>was to argue that we should indeed use exactly the model that motivated me to write the post. </span></i><span>The comment is here in full:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>&gt;&gt; If a model gives a definitely wrong answer anywhere, it is useless everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span>Except if it needs to be used right now to make important decisions and it’s the best model we have. See: </span><a href=""https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-americaa""><span>https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america</span></a></p></blockquote>
<p><span>We could plausibly think this is the best model we have? Oh my are we screwed.</span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<h3><b>The Baseline Scenario That Makes No Sense</b></h3>
<p><span>There seems to be a developing consensus on many fronts, for now, that the model linked above represents our reality. The model says it is ‘designed to be a planning tool’ and that is exactly what is happening here. </span></p>
<p><span>What is this model doing? Time to</span><a href=""https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.27.20043752v1.full.pdf""> <span>look at the pdf</span></a><span>. </span></p>
<p><span>Here’s the money quote that describes the core of what they are actually doing.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>A covariate of days with expected exponential growth in the cumulative death rate was created using information on the number of days after the death rate exceeded 0.31 per million to the day when 4 different social distancing measures were mandated by local and national government:</span></p>
<p><span>School closures, non-essential business closures including bars and restaurants, stay-at-home recommendations, and travel restrictions including public transport closures. Days with 1 measure were counted as 0.67 equivalents, days with 2 measures as 0.334 equivalents <strong>and with 3 or 4 measures as 0</strong>. For states that have not yet implemented all of the closure measures, we assumed that the remaining measures will be put in place within 1 week. This lag between reaching a threshold death rate and implementing more aggressive social distancing was combined with the observed period of exponential growth in the cumulative death rate seen in Wuhan after Level 4 social distancing was implemented, adjusted for the median time from incidence to death. For ease of interpretation of statistical coefficients, this covariate was normalized so the value for Wuhan was 1.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span>In other words, this model assumes that social distancing measures work </span><i><span>really, really well. </span></i><span>Absurdly well. All you have to do to stop Covid-19 is any three of: Close schools, close non-essential businesses, tell people to stay at home, impose travel restrictions.</span></p>
<p><span>If you do that and maintain it, people stop dying. Entirely.</span></p>
<p><span>Look at the graph they have up as of this writing (updated on 4/10). By June 20, they predict actual zero deaths that day and every future day. They have us under 100 deaths per day by the end of May.</span></p>
<p><span>The peak in hospital use? Today, April 11.</span></p>
<p><span>The peak in deaths? Yesterday, April 10. For New York, several days ago, with our last death </span><i><span>on May 20. </span></i></p>
<p><span>In other words, considering the delay in deaths is about three weeks, they predict that </span><i><span>no one in New York State will be infected after April.</span></i><span> No one! We’ll all be safe in only three weeks! </span></p>
<p><span>This is despite us not yet seeing any evidence of a major decline in positive test rates in New York. Deaths lag positive tests by weeks.</span></p>
<p><span>Hard to be more maximally optimistic than that. One could call this the ‘theoretical beyond best case scenario.’ </span></p>
<p><span>(The statement is actually even more absurd than that, considering variation in time to case progression, but I’m going to let that one go.)</span></p>
<p><span>(Exercise for the reader, you have five seconds: What is the implied R0?)</span></p>
<p><span>(Second exercise for the reader: If there are four things that reduce the spread of infection some amount, and R0 is about 4 initially, and you implement three of them, what is the new R0?) </span></p>
<h3><b>They Account for Uncertainty, Right?</b></h3>
<p><span>They generously account for uncertainty with the following ‘confidence interval’:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>Figure 9 shows the expected cumulative death numbers with 95% uncertainty intervals. The average forecast suggests 81,114 deaths, but the range is large, from 38,242 to 162,106 deaths.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span>(Note: this was as of paper publishing, numbers are now lower.)</span></p>
<p><span>That is not how this works. That is not how any of this works.</span></p>
<p>The way this works <em>once we correct for all the obvious absurdities</em> is that this is a <em>lower bound </em>on how good things could <em>possibly</em> go.</p>
<p><span>If I am incorrect, and that <em>is</em> how any of this works I have some </span><i><span>very, very large </span></i><span>bets I would like to place.</span></p>
<h3><b>A Simpler Version of the Same Model</b></h3>
<p><span>The model seems functionally the same as this:</span></p>
<p><span>Assume all reported numbers are accurate, and assume that no one gets infected once you nominally implement three of the four social distancing measures. Which you assume every US state will do within a week from the model starting.</span></p>
<p><span>Let’s simplify that again. </span></p>
<p><span>Assume that no one under an even half-serious (three quarters serious?) lock down ever gets infected out-of-household.</span></p>
<p><span>We still see deaths for a few weeks, because there is a lag, but then it’s all over.</span></p>
<h3><b>What the Model Outputs</b></h3>
<p><span>As of when I wrote this line, this more-than-maximally-optimistic model projects 61,545 deaths in the United States.</span></p>
<p><i><span>People with power, people with influence, what some might call our “best people,” are on television and in the media predicting around 60,000 total American deaths.</span></i></p>
<p><span>I will say that again.</span></p>
<p><b>We are telling the public a death count that effectively implies that by about a month from now, and in many places earlier than that, no new American ever gets infected with Covid-19.</b></p>
<p><span>The model assumes that our half measures towards social distancing will have the same impact as </span><i><span>was reported</span></i><span> in Wuhan. In Wuhan, they blockaded apartment buildings, took anyone suspected of being positive away for isolation, and still, months after this model says there are no infections or even deaths, has severe movement restrictions and blockades up all over the place.</span></p>
<p><span>Whereas the New York City subways continue to run, and California thinks weed sales are an essential business.</span></p>
<p><span>I hope that my perception of this is wrong. Perhaps everyone knows this model is nonsense. Perhaps there are better ones out there – if you know of one you respect, please let me know about it! </span></p>
<p><span>But again, this is a maximally optimistic model on every front. I keep seeing people whose voice matters share this same final answer of predicting 60,000 deaths. If it’s not from a model doing </span><i><span>more or less this, </span></i><span>I don’t know how you get an answer in that ballpark.</span></p>
<p>Unless of course answers are being chosen without regard to reality.</p>

Maybe <em>I</em> am the problem, and my skills, situation, or environment are not suited for remembering basic facts that I paid $6,000 to learn. There are a few ways in which I could be failing at this task. </p><p>First, maybe I am not good at school. I reject this hypothesis out-of-hand, mostly because I have a fragile ego, but also partly because it&apos;s not true. I scored in the 99th percentile on the LSAT, attended a top-3 law school in the US, and graduated with honors. All these points don&apos;t insulate me from being bad at school, but the <em>vast majority</em> of law school attendees are even worse at school (not learning) than me. You know that scene in <em>Taken</em> where Liam Neeson says &quot;I have a very particular set of skills...&quot;? That&apos;s me with school; I am <em>good</em> at school. If I can&apos;t retain this knowledge, the entire system might as well commit its tax-advantaged resources to rolling boulders up hills for all the good they&apos;re doing. </p><p>Second, maybe I have framed the problem incorrectly. It&apos;s true that retaining material from a Civil Procedure class is not a standard validated benchmark. However, I promise you that I&apos;ll receive similar results on any benchmark you devise for 90% of the law school classes I took; I only picked Civil Procedure for this exercise because it is alphabetically first in the list of required law school classes I took. My problem is not that I don&apos;t remember Civil Procedure; my problem is that I remember almost nothing. </p><p>Third, maybe I didn&apos;t study properly. This, unlike the previous two, is a plausible hypothesis. I did work my way through about ~70% of the study tactics the professor recommended, including attending class regularly, completing all the readings ahead of time, taking good notes, and reviewing all the material at the end of class. But if I had done more, like made flashcards, practiced with spaced repetition, joined a study group, or just spent more time with the material, I would remember more today. Some other students do remember much more than I do, partly because they used more intense study tactics.  </p><h2>School is just a signaling mechanism </h2><p>As <a href=""https://www.econlib.org/archives/2018/02/is_education_wo.html"">Bryan Caplan</a> says:</p><blockquote>There are TWO solid business reasons to pay extra for educated workers.&#xA0; One is that education teaches useful skills, <em>transforming</em>&#xA0;unskilled students into skilled workers. This is the&#xA0; standard &#x201C;human capital&#x201D; story.&#xA0; The other reason, though, is that education <em>certifies</em> useful skills, helping employers distinguish skilled workers from imposters.&#xA0; This is the &#x201C;signaling&#x201D; story. [...] My best estimate is that signaling explains 80% of the payoff.</blockquote><p>In other words, students go to school because employers hire people with degrees, not because they want to learn. According to this hypothesis, it is perfectly rational for me to only remember odds-and-ends from my law school education; the only thing I need to retain is my degree, not any knowledge. </p><p>Legal employers largely behave in accordance with the signaling theory. It was common knowledge among the student body that (A) the highest paying or most prestigious jobs mostly go to graduates of top law schools and (B) as long as you are a graduate of one of the top law schools, you can get a high paying or prestigious job without having excellent grades. A prestigious degree essentially equals a good job. You might need a prestigious degree AND excellent grades to get a very rare job (e.g., a Supreme Court clerk, of which there are less than 40 each year), but most people were not aiming for those jobs. </p><p>Schools also behave in accordance with the signaling theory. Most blatantly, five of the top fourteen law schools in the US have adopted <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_law_school_GPA_curves"">idiosyncratic grading schemes</a> that make it hard for employers to understand exactly how competent a student is (inasmuch as grades ever indicate competence). These grading systems range from no fixed curves to pass/no-pass grades to UChicago&apos;s (hilarious) &quot;numeric grade with median of 177.&quot; There is a discredited security strategy called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_through_obscurity"">security through obscurity</a>, where you secure your system by keeping the system secret, instead of making it resistant to attacks. This is analogous: grading through obscurity. </p><p>This privilege of using a grade scheme that obfuscates is exercised by market-making schools, whereas market-taking schools largely stick to A/B/C/D/Fs. But even these latter schools, while not prestigious enough to make up their own grading schemes, have an array of schemes to choose from to make their students more attractive to employers. Employers judge schools by how many of their graduates find gainful employment. Schools want to maximize this number so that its graduates look like catches. In good times, they&apos;ll do so with good ol&apos;-fashioned definition massaging, defining &quot;long-term&quot; employment as employment lasting a year and &quot;J.D. advantage jobs&quot; to include jobs such as FBI agent and paralegal, for which a J.D. is only marginally more advantageous than breathing oxygen. In bad times, such as the Great Recession, they&apos;ll do so by employing graduating students themselves in temporary positions. </p><p>Students, too, behave in accordance with the signaling theory to some extent. First year (1L, in the jargon) grades matter quite a lot for most student&apos;s first post-graduation job, so students do work hard in the first year. However, most 2L and 3L (3LOL, in the jargon) students skate by, trying to apply the bare minimum effort possible. </p><h2>Poor teaching</h2><p>I remember more from high school than I do from law school. I remember random facts that I have never used since high school, like the fact that the ideal gas law is <em>PV = nRT</em> and the French verb <em>venir </em>requires special conjugation in the past tense. This is not as bizarre as it seems at first glance. </p><p><a href=""https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/BSJbPZP9AAyivpmBE/you-have-four-words"">A recent post</a> explained that the more people you need to coordinate, the less bandwidth you have for transmitting information to them. If you are talking to a handful of people, you can have a deep conversation, but if you are talking to thousands of people, you shout a short slogan at them. I think the same is true across time. If you are teaching a student in your class, you can give that student millions of words of information. By the time a student goes to his first job, that student remembers thousands of words of information. By the time a student reaches the peak of her career, that student remembers hundreds of words of information. By retirement, tens of words, if that. </p><p>This is not pure conjecture. <a href=""https://www.nwea.org/blog/2018/summer-learning-loss-what-we-know-what-were-learning/"">Middle school students can lose large chunks of their reading and math knowledge over summer break,</a> even though those are basic skills continuously reinforced by real-world tasks! The information taught in law school bears only a passing resemblance to real-world tasks, and is almost never reinforced after graduation. Of course it is forgotten. Given that students will forget most things they learn, teachers should ideally teach in a way that mitigates the damage of the decline. The most important information should be impossible to forget. </p><p>Grade school teachers are better than professors at forcing unforgettable information into students&apos; minds. (They&apos;re not perfect, but they&apos;re much better.) They&apos;ll use alliteration, repetition, rhymes, and chanting to get their students to memorize information <em>forever</em>. My high school chemistry teacher would say &quot;piv nurt&quot; every day for a few weeks when teaching us <em>PV = nRT</em>. That&apos;s not a good mnemonic; it&apos;s just two meaningless syllables! But the repetition worked. I will remember piv nurt on my deathbed. Same for DR MRS VANDERTRAMPP. And SOH CAH TOA. And &quot;always add +c.&quot; And many other little factoids. My professors, on the other hand, when telling us important information, would preface it with &quot;And if there is one thing you remember from this class, it is this...&quot; That&apos;s it. </p><p>Law school professors will hate changing how they teach. They didn&apos;t get into their prestigious jobs to develop mnemonics for fully-grown adults. It&apos;s beneath their dignity. The responsibility for retaining information rests with their students. I get it. It does seem silly to suggest that famous credentialed lawyers spend their time treating their adult students like high-schoolers. But the current situation, where these very same famous credentialed lawyers spend months teaching students, only for the students to forget most of what they&apos;ve learned within weeks, doesn&apos;t seem like its befitting their dignity either. </p><h2>The point was to learn meta-skills</h2><p>The canard that law school repeats often is &quot;we teach you how to learn.&quot; It&apos;s fine that I remember almost nothing from my classes, because that was never the goal. The goal was to learn the skills needed to learn the law. Now the rest of my life can be an orgy of learning, limited only by my initiative. </p><p>Learning about anything, including meta-skills, requires looping through the below list many times: </p><ul><li>I do a task </li><li>I receive feedback on the task, telling me what I did well and what I did poorly </li><li>I update my mental modal of how to do the task </li></ul><p>Law school fails at this loop because it makes sure tenured professors rarely have to besmirch themselves by giving feedback.  </p><p>Law school instructors, although all human, like the Eloi and the Morlocks can be split into two classes. There are tenured (or tenure-track) professors, and there are the rest. You can distinguish them by the size of their offices. </p><p>If you take a class with a tenured professor, it is extremely unlikely you will receive feedback on tasks you complete. It happened to me maybe twice in three years, and I&apos;m including feedback given by the professors&apos; TAs in that count. Even more annoyingly, you might not even have any tasks to complete! In almost all classes, the student&apos;s only job throughout the semester is to complete the reading, and if called upon in class, to answer reading-comprehension-type questions about the reading. (Law schools refer to this as the Socratic Method, but it&apos;s more like read-and-regurgitate.) Neither the reading nor the perfunctory questioning that follows is a  meaningful task on which law students need feedback, given that law students are already good at reading and reading comprehension.   </p><p>If you take a class with a non-tenured professor, on the other hand, you can receive lots of excellent feedback. However, these have their own problems. First, they require small student-to-teacher ratios so students can receive feedback, which means law schools need to hire lots of teachers to run them, which means they are expensive, which means law schools are wary of having too many of these. Second, the subject matter taught by non-tenured professors doesn&apos;t always overlap with that taught by tenured professors. Students end up experiencing a classic Catch-22: one can either properly learn an unwanted subject, or poorly learn a wanted subject. Third, almost all these classes are structured as practicums where students solve problems for real or fictional clients. Especially when the clients are real, these classes quickly devolve into base concerns of &quot;How do we fix this client&apos;s problem?&quot; rather than the lofty aim of &quot;Let&apos;s learn how to learn.&quot; On the whole though, these classes are much better than classes with tenured professors. </p><h2>Summary </h2><p>Below are my best guesses for how much each of these hypotheses explains why I don&apos;t remember anything. </p><ul><li>[25%] User error because I didn&apos;t study enough </li><li>[30%] School is just a signaling mechanism, so remembering actual content would be pointless</li><li>[40%] Poor teaching means I have and will continue to forget information at the whims of my subconscious </li><li>[5%] The point of law school was to learn meta-skills, not information </li></ul>",ketchupduck,ketchupduck,ketchupduck,

I recently ran ethernet to my </span>

<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/making-a-standing-desk"">desk</a> at 

<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/stepping-up-isolation"">home</a>, and I've been really
impressed with how much it helps for video calls.  Not only are
garbled sections less common, I'm finding us talking over each other
less.



</p><p>

This makes a lot of sense: wifi's going to struggle more with latency
(lag) because the radio spectrum is a noisy shared space.  I think I
hadn't realized how much of an effect a wired connection would have on
latency, or how much better a video call is when latency is lower.
This is essentially the same reason serious multiplayer gamers use
wired connections, but I hadn't been thinking of it that way.

</p>

<p>

The professional way to run ethernet is to use a roll of ethernet
cable, jacks, and a cable crimper.  This lets you make very small
holes, just the size of the cable.  I don't have these, it's not a
good time for borrowing things, and I didn't expect to be doing enough
ethernet for it to be worth it to buy one.  So I got a long enough
cable for the whole run, erring on the ""much too long"" side, and made
holes big enough for the cable and jack.  I was very careful of the
jack as I went, since if the jack got damaged I'd have needed to start
over.

</p>

<p>

The router was three rooms away, and I could run the cable through the
attic.  I picked places at both ends that were relatively
inconspicuous, poked nails up through the ceiling in each place, found
the other ends of the nails in the attic, expanded the holes to be big
enough for the cable, ran the cable, and cleaned up the dust.  My
laptop doesn't have an ethernet port, but I had an adapter.  It took
me about an hour from deciding to run the cable to having everything
working.

</p>

<p>

While it's hard to quantify the effect on the calls, to check that I
wasn't imagining things I ran some latency tests with <code>ping</code>.
I picked an IP at my ISP and ran:

</p>

<pre>
ping -c 256 -i 0.1 [IP]
</pre>

This tells my computer to send 256 packets to that IP, one every
100ms, and time how long they take to come back.  First I tested on a
relatively idle network, with my computer not doing anything and most
of my housemates asleep:



<p>

<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/wifi-vs-ethernet-idle-connection-big.png""><img src=""https://www.jefftk.com/wifi-vs-ethernet-idle-connection.png"" srcset=""https://www.jefftk.com/wifi-vs-ethernet-idle-connection.png 550w, https://www.jefftk.com/wifi-vs-ethernet-idle-connection-2x.png 1100w"" /></a>



</p>

<p>

You can see that ethernet is generally a bit better than wifi, with
occasional blips, though even the blips aren't that bad.  Then I
tested on a heavily loaded connection, by visiting a page with enough
images that it wouldn't finish downloading them before the test
stopped:

</p>

<p>

<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/wifi-vs-ethernet-busy-connection-big.png""><img src=""https://www.jefftk.com/wifi-vs-ethernet-busy-connection.png"" srcset=""https://www.jefftk.com/wifi-vs-ethernet-busy-connection.png 550w, https://www.jefftk.com/wifi-vs-ethernet-busy-connection-2x.png 1100w"" /></a>

</p>

<p>

Now you can see that wifi is really struggling, while ethernet is
comparatively solid.  In fact, heavily loaded ethernet does better
than idle wifi:

Since you don't get the real benefits of a wired connection until both
sides of the connection are wired, now I need to convince all my
teammates to run ethernet.

It means that someone </em>else <em>knows how the light bulb works.</em> - <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/L22jhyY9ocXQNLqyE/science-as-curiosity-stopper"">Eliezar Yudkowsky</a></blockquote><blockquote><em>In principle, I agree with the notion that it is unforgivable to not want to know, and not want to improve your map to match the territory.&#xA0; However, even the most curious person in the world cannot maintain equal curiosity about all things, and even if they could there are limits on time and energy. - </em><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/g4QdmxFos3Q2zseZo/the-limits-of-curiosity"">Elizabeth</a></blockquote><blockquote><em>Rarely am I pulled by a specific desire to know. And most of my learning happens at those rare times.</em> - <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/WrSe4aB8sWBy3Nphm/use-curiosity"">Anna Salamon</a></blockquote><p>Which question immediately sparks your <em>specific desire to know</em>?</p><p>1) Which enzymes are directly involved in the human transcription of lactase?</p><p>2) How do cells manufacture proteins?</p><p>3) Which theory is the best account of abiogenesis?</p><p>4) Is life inherently valuable?</p><p>5) If we could grow artificial human organs, would it be possible to cure aging by periodically replacing the worn-out parts of our bodies?</p><p>Without some research, I could not supply more than a rudimentary answer for any of these questions. But for me personally, #5 is the only one that sparks my curiosity. </p><p>Why? The first three questions represent different strata in the lake of systematized knowledge. If I ever needed an answer, I could look up fine-grained information on each of them. The fourth question is bottomless, and I know in advance that there will be no definitive answer. None of them suggest a pressing reason I&apos;d want to know.</p><p>The last question is different. I can immediately see its practical and scholarly significance. Breaking it down into an array of tractable research questions, then determining what is known and unknown, would be an adventure.</p><p>In pursuing my inquiry to the limits of scientific knowledge, I would eventually arrive at strange questions, with a void where the answers should be. I&apos;d never normally think to ask these strange questions, nor care particularly about the answers. Now they would be imbued with the significance of my original purpose.</p><p>Curiosity must have been a useful sensation for our ancestors, but a costly one. It motivates action, sometimes patterns of action that are tiring, dangerous, and require the efforts of the whole tribe. Learning is costly. So evolution shaped our curiosity into a getting feeling, a greedy feeling.</p><p><strong>What is intrinsic motivation?</strong></p><p>That makes curiosity sound like it&apos;s fueled by extrinsic motivations, which seems counterintuitive.</p><p>One <a href=""https://sci-hub.tw/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269833085_The_Intrinsic-Extrinsic_Dichotomy_Toward_Conceptual_Clarity"">definition of intrinsic motivation</a> is:</p><blockquote>Intrinsic work motivation is a cognitive state reflecting the extent to which the worker attributes the force of his or her task behaviors to outcomes derived from the task per se; that is, from outcomes which are not mediated by a source external to the task-person situation. Such a state of motivation can be characterized as a self-fulfilling experience.  </blockquote><p>OK, this needs some unpacking. Here are two different scenarios:</p><ul><li>John works for BizCorp on salary. He is put on a large team, tasked to build an e-commerce site to sell a new type of widget.</li><li>John has invented a new type of widget. He builds an e-commerce site to sell it.</li></ul><p>In the first case, whether or not BizCorp has an e-commerce website, John&apos;s getting paid. The outcome of his work, his reward, is &quot;mediated by a source external to the task-person situation.&quot;</p><p>In the second case, John is not going to get his widget sold without an e-commerce site. His monetary reward, and the satisfaction of bringing a useful new widget to the world, depends directly on creating an e-commerce site. If he finds the creation of the site enjoyable, so much the better.</p><p>In the case of curiosity, the reward at the end, tangible or envisioned, will only be available when the curiosity has been satisfied, the quest completed. If you&apos;re trying to cure aging, you don&apos;t get the reward of immortality unless you succeed. And just think of how much more there would be to learn and experience with that achieved!</p><p>If you feel inspired by that objective, even knowing that you personally might die before the investment in research pays back society, then I believe the goal of immortality would constitute an intrinsic reward. So would the pleasure of discovery as you worked in the lab.</p><p>So curiosity can be a greedy feeling, a getting feeling, and still stem from intrinsic motivation.</p><p><strong>Making yourself curious</strong></p><p>Back in 2012, lukeprog wrote <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/bGtdeqbgTzuLvZ5zn/get-curious"">Get Curious</a>. It included visualization, meditation, and brainstorming activities for when you <em>should</em> be curious, but <em>aren&apos;t. </em>It follows the narrative in which some inner drive is weak, and we have to conjure up some mysterious inner force to overcome the deficiency.</p><p>I believe that lack of curiosity in a seemingly-important question does not stem from lack of drive or laziness.</p><p>I think it&apos;s that <em>effective curiosity</em> is the synthesis of playful, childlike imaginative interest in a topic we don&apos;t understand, and our skillful, adult capacities in an activity we&apos;re experienced with. If we don&apos;t practice synthesizing these two sides of ourselves, or worse, if we only practice one of these potentials and neglect the other, we&apos;ll lose our sense of curiosity.</p><p>We&apos;ll be left as either skillful but stuck, or imaginative but incapable: a Ben Wyatt or an Andy Dwyer, if you watch Parks &amp; Rec. Part of the arc of both characters is a reconnection with the other half of themselves. Ben Wyatt comes to understand that even though his imagination got him into trouble at an early age, now that he&apos;s a responsible and focused adult, allowing his imagination back in will allow him to accomplish amazing things and make his life far more full and rich than it could ever be as a small-town Indiana budget-slasher. Andy Dwyer discovers that when his natural playfulness find a structured outlet as a children&apos;s musician, it brings him not just money and respect, but a larger vision for his creativity and a chance to be a leader.</p><p>I think the reason why we subscribe to the flagging-drive model of curiosity is that life forces learning upon us. I&apos;m in a calculus course right now, and boy, it would be a lot easier to master that body of knowledge if I was <em>hungry</em> to know it. If only there was a way to make myself feel charged up to learn calculus every single day.</p><p>I don&apos;t know how to do that.</p><p>But if the problem isn&apos;t forcing yourself to want to learn any arbitrary body of knowledge you choose, but stimulating your passion for investigation, then there is a way forward.</p><p>1) Imagine an ability or set of knowledge or invention or experience that would absolutely delight and amaze you <em>right now </em>if you could access it. I can think of lots of examples for myself:</p><ul><li>Completely and reversibly being able to change my sex and gender</li><li>Being immortal, or at least very long-lived</li><li>Being able to make new friends easily</li><li>Knowing how to reliably find and observe large animals in the wild</li><li>Be better than the stock market at predicting the economic impact of a pandemic.</li></ul><p>2) Pick one, and write down some ideas for how we could potentially achieve that goal, based on what you know right now. For being immortal or very long-lived, I&apos;d write:</p><ul><li> Learning how to grow new organs from my own DNA, and replacing my worn-out parts as they age</li><li>Uploading my brain into a computer controlling a robot, and as my immortal robot-self figuring out how to manufacture a new human body for myself</li></ul><p>3) <em>Now</em> start researching the efforts that are underway for #2 (almost certainly, there are some) and try to figure out which seems most practical. Keep a sense of all the sub-questions you might have about your original imagination. Do you need to investigate deeper into one of them, or transition to fleshing out your knowledge on a different sub-question? Always be motivated in your research by the desire to know how to do the impossible, by your desire to turn a fantasy into reality.</p><p>These have a strong relationship with lukeprog&apos;s three steps for getting curious:</p><p>1) Feel that you don&apos;t already know the answer.</p><p>2) Want to know the answer.</p><p>3) Sprint headlong into reality.</p><p>But lukeprog&apos;s writing is predicated on the idea that you feel as if you know the answer, don&apos;t really want to know, and feel no drive to discover it. And this is all because you&apos;ve selected an arbitrary topic - perhaps a topic life forced on you, or one your peers think is important, or one you feel you ought to be concerned with - and tried to make yourself get curious about it.</p><p>If instead, you start with an imaginative vision that you&apos;d genuinely, immediately feel very excited about if it were realized, the basic circumstances are changed. I know right from the start that I&apos;ve got no idea how to be immortal and have no idea whether or not progressive organ transplants might accomplish this. I do want to know the answer - that would be fascinating - and I can already think of the first questions I would look up. Googling &quot;could organ transplants make us immortal&quot; would be my first step. This is the sprinting headlong into reality.</p><p><strong>Curiosity is not a cure-all: deliberate practice is still hard</strong></p><p>What if I am trying to learn calculus, though, and want that hit of curiosity to drive me to study?</p><p>I already know that it will be helpful for my studies in grad school. But that&apos;s a fairly extrinsic motivation. Oh sure, I believe in an abstract way that calculus will eventually be directly useful for my intended course of study in computational biology. But I also have no ability to imagine how. I know I don&apos;t know enough to figure out how to apply it right now.</p><p>Games are generally a good way to get your brain activated for an arbitrary goal. So are stories. But part of what makes a game or a story good is that they make the challenges or the language interesting. Shoehorning in the solving of equations is a massive design challenge. You end up with a game that doesn&apos;t entertain and a homework assignment that&apos;s inefficient.</p><p>The best I&apos;ve ever been able to do is to relate to my studies a little bit like it&apos;s a sport.</p><p>I get into the zone. I see how quickly, how effortlessly, how accurately I can answer problems. How fast can I read this chapter? What&apos;s the craziest organic molecule I can draw and then name?</p><p>I try to invent my own problems. I rewrite passages in my own words. I don&apos;t just try to answer the exercises and remember the concepts. I try to remember what the exercise <em>questions</em> were, or even to make up my own exercise questions. It&apos;s the next best thing to tutoring someone else.</p><p>I&apos;m not being guided by curiosity. I&apos;m being motivated by competitiveness and restlessness and the desire to test myself, to push the limits<em>.</em> When I&apos;m at my best in my studies, I&apos;m acting more like a fiercely competitive soccer player, or maybe like the stereotype of a hot-shot fighter pilot.</p><p>So what keeps a soccer player or a fighter pilot focused on their practice?</p><p>One of my skills is playing classical piano music. Some of the most challenging pieces I ever played are J&apos;eux D&apos;eau, by Ravel, and the Ballades of Chopin. I remember what motivated me there.</p><ul><li>The visceral beauty of the sounds they composed, which I was reproducing with my own hands.</li><li>The physical coordination challenging of being able to play a complicated arpeggio flawlessly.</li><li>The physical thrill of speeding up, releasing tension, and stretching my ears out to hear not just notes but music.</li><li>The drive to complete a defined piece of music, to be able to play it from beginning to end, that motivated me to put my butt on the bench every day.</li><li>The interest that comes with varying rubato and dynamics, listening to inner or bass lines, trying to hear melodies not as a sequence of sounds but as a voice.</li></ul><p>There was a measure of curiosity here - interest in these pieces, the desire to make them my own. Also of competitiveness, the desire to play some of the most difficult music in the classical canon, or to impress and delight others with my ability </p><p>The second remains as I study calculus. It&apos;s partly the desire to master math that others find intimidating that motivates me to study calculus. Or to be able to help others with complex, important projects that need a &quot;math guy.&quot;</p><p>That sense of curiosity is missing to some extent. When I start my third quarter of calculus, I&apos;m not going to know in advance what it entails. There&apos;s no way to effortlessly understand as somebody else demonstrates it, the way I can listen to a recording of a Ravel piece I&apos;m considering learning. The doing is identical to the observing. Math is not a spectator sport. That&apos;s probably why it&apos;s so hard to get people interested in learning it.</p><p>My guess is that doing a math assignment can be a thrill, just as much as scrimmage on a soccer team. And that this sense of thrill can be cultivated.</p><p>But if you approach a math assignment as though it&apos;s a task to complete in order to get a grade, or a tool you&apos;re using to force new neural connections in your brain, you won&apos;t be paying attention to that sense of thrill<em>.</em></p><p>Where does it come from?</p><p>When you&apos;re little, playing dodge ball, the game&apos;s in motion whether you&apos;re ready or not. If the ball hits you, you&apos;re out. There&apos;s no re-do. It&apos;s not a big deal, but secretly, you want to be perfect at dodge ball. You want to hit the other kids with every throw, and never be hit yourself. And you want to do all that while time, and the game, run on.</p><p>Can your math assignment be the same way?</p><p>Can you connect with time as you work on calculus the same way you connect with it in a game of dodge ball? Can you approach organization on the page, accurate algebra, progress through the substitutions and graphing, with the same tenacity and joy you brought to targeting Johnny on the other team with your rubber ball of death?</p><p>Can you find a thrill in the right answer, the same way you felt a thrill when you heard the smack as Johnny got hit by your throw? Can you take delight in noticing you almost dropped a negative sign? Can you approach realizing you missed a step and have to redo the problem the same way you&apos;d have felt getting hit by Johnny when your back was turned - not as frustrated at getting out as you were eager to get back in and seek vengeance?</p><p>Math is a lonely game, played against one.</p><p>And maybe the idea that a calculus assignment would be as exciting as a childhood game of dodgeball is a pipe dream.</p><p>But think about what actually goes into being a fighter pilot. Learning a lot of controls. Switches and dials and messing around with a joystick. You&apos;re not running around, you&apos;re sitting in a chair, seatbelt on. The wind is not in your hair. If it was the feeling of spinning and high speeds that you loved, a roller coaster would be a safer and easier way to get that sensation than joining the damned air force.</p><p>And yet people compete fiercely and work their asses off to be fighter pilots. They&apos;re all by themselves up in that plane. It&apos;s a lonely game, almost always played against one.</p><p>Likewise marksmanship. Likewise the piano. Likewise computer programming. Likewise SCUBA diving.</p><p>I think the people who stick with these activities must do a few things:</p><ul><li>They get their workspace set up so that they have everything they need to practice. They eliminate trivial inconveniences.</li><li>They&apos;re in the habit of defining small but meaningful projects for themselves, breaking those projects down into steps, and practicing the steps until the whole project attains a smooth and satisfying flow.</li><li>They&apos;re looking not just for goal-oriented success but for little, intuitive, hard-to-explain ways of finding a thrill in the practice itself. They make little games for themselves that would seem utterly neurotic and silly to other people. And those self-imposed, idiosyncratic games are actually an important part of the lived experience of practicing for these people.</li><li>They look for opportunities to teach and show off their skills.</li><li>They wear their heart on their sleeve. They want other people to know they&apos;re a marksman, a pianist, a programmer, a SCUBA diver, a fighter pilot. They need all those solitary hours of hard work to have social meaning. They want to make their isolated hours of toil visible and tangible to others and to themselves.</li></ul><p>This quarter, I&apos;m going to see if I can make my calculus and chemistry classes less like toil and more like soccer or piano practice used to be. I don&apos;t know what that means yet, or how in practice I can achieve that. But that impossible-seeming goal - what if calculus and chemistry could be as thrilling and joyful as sports or music - that&apos;s the first step in activating curiosity. I think I&apos;m on the right track.</p>",AllAmericanBreakfast,directedevolution,DirectedEvolution,

A couple of people recently made some very pointed observations about my lack of self-compassion, and it provoked a strange sadness in me. Sadness because while I know that their point is true &#x2013; I am often very hard on myself, to the detriment of my happiness &#x2013; those thought patterns seem so philosophically necessary that I have been unable to change them. This post is my attempt to unpack and understand that philosophical necessity.</p><p>Our ability to feel compassion is intimately tied to our judgement of responsibility in a situation. If you get unexpectedly laid off from your job, that&#x2019;s terrible luck and most people will express compassion. However, if you were an awful employee who showed up late and did your job poorly, then most people aren&#x2019;t going to be as sympathetic when you finally get fired. As the saying goes: you made your bed, you lie in it. More abstractly, we tend to feel less compassion for someone if we think that they&#x2019;re responsible for their own misfortune. This all tracks with my lack of self-compassion, as I have also been told that I have an overdeveloped sense of personal responsibility. If I feel responsible for something, I&#x2019;m not going to be very compassionate towards myself when it goes wrong; I&#x2019;m going to feel guilt or shame instead.</p><p>Of course, this raises the question of what we&#x2019;re fundamentally responsible for; the question of compassion is less relevant if I actually am responsible for the things that are causing me grief. People largely assume that we&#x2019;re responsible for our own actions, and this seems like a reasonable place to start. It makes sense, because our own actions are where we have the clearest sense of <em>control</em>. While we can control parts of the outside world, that process is less direct and less exact. Our control over ourselves is typically much clearer, though still not always perfect.</p><p>If we assume that we have control over ourselves and our actions, this means that we also have responsibility for ourselves and our actions. If we avoid or ignore that responsibility and we&#x2019;re not happy with the consequences, we don&#x2019;t deserve much, if any, compassion: it&#x2019;s our own damn fault. This all seems&#x2026; normal and fairly standard, I think, but it&#x2019;s an important foundation to build on.</p><h2>Freedom, and Responsibility over Time</h2><p>Now let&#x2019;s explore what it means to be responsible for our actions, because that can be quite subtle. Sometimes our choices are limited, or we take an action under duress. Even ignoring those obvious edge cases, <a href=""https://grandunifiedcrazy.com/2019/02/18/narrative-dissonance/"">our narrative dictates the majority of our day-to-day decisions</a>. What responsibility do we bear in all of these cases? Ultimately I believe in a fairly Sartrean version of freedom, where we have a near-limitless range of possible actions every day, and are responsible for which actions we take. Obviously some things are physically impossible (I can&#x2019;t walk to Vancouver in a day), but there are a lot of things that make no sense in the current framework of my life that are still theoretically options for me. If nothing else, I could <em>start</em> walking to Vancouver today.</p><p>Assuming that we&#x2019;re responsible for all of our actions in this fairly direct way, we also end up responsible for the consequences of actions <em>not</em> taken on a given day. There is a sense in which I am responsible for not walking to Vancouver today, because I chose to write this essay instead. I am responsible for my decision to write instead of walk, and thus for the consequence of <em>not being on my way to Vancouver</em>. This feels kind of weird and a bit irrelevant, so let&#x2019;s recast it into a more useful example.</p><p>A few hours from now when I finish this essay, I&#x2019;ll be hungry to the point of lightheadedness because I won&#x2019;t have eaten since breakfast. Am I responsible for my future hunger? There&#x2019;s a certain existential perspective in which I&#x2019;m not, since it&#x2019;s a biological process that happens whether I will it or not. But it&#x2019;s equally true that I could have stopped writing several hours earlier, put the essay on hold, and had lunch at a reasonable time. I <em>am</em> definitely responsible for my decision to keep writing instead of eating lunch, and so there is a pretty concrete way in which I am at least partly responsible for my hunger.</p><p>This isn&#x2019;t to say that I&#x2019;m necessarily going to be unhappy with that decision; even in hindsight I may believe that finishing the essay in one fell swoop was worth a little discomfort. But it does mean that I can&#x2019;t avoid taking some responsibility for that discomfort. And, since I&#x2019;m responsible for it, it&#x2019;s not something I can feel much self-compassion over; if I decide in hindsight that it was a terrible decision, then it was still a decision that I freely made. If I experience a predictable consequence of that decision, it&#x2019;s my own damn fault.</p><p>This conclusion still feels pretty reasonable to me, so let&#x2019;s take a weirder concrete example, and imagine that in three months I get attacked on the street.</p><h2>Predictability in Hindsight</h2><p>I don&#x2019;t have a lot of experience with physical violence, so if I were to get attacked in my current state then I would likely lose, and be badly hurt, even imagining my attacker does not have a weapon. To what degree am I responsible for this pain? Intuitively, not at all, but again, the attack happens three months from now. I could very well decide to spend the next three months focused on an aggressive fitness and self-defence regimen (let&#x2019;s assume that this training would be effective, and that I would not get hurt in this case). Today, I made the decision to write this essay instead of embarking on such a regimen; in the moment today, this decision to write is clearly one that I am responsible for. Does this mean I&#x2019;m responsible for the future pain that I experience? I&#x2019;d much rather avoid that pain than finish this essay, so maybe I should stop writing and start training!</p><p>The flaw in this argument, of course, is that I don&#x2019;t <em>know</em> that I&#x2019;m going to get attacked in three months. In fact, it seems like something that&#x2019;s very unlikely. In choosing not to train today, I can&#x2019;t accept responsibility for the full cost of that future pain. I should only take responsibility for the very small amount of pain that is left when that future is weighted by the small probability it will actually occur. If I did somehow know with perfect accuracy that I was going to be attacked, then the situation seems somewhat different: I would feel responsible for not preparing appropriately in that case, in the same way I would feel responsible for not preparing for a boxing match that I&#x2019;d registered for.</p><p>All of this seems to work pretty well when looking <em>forward</em> in time. We make predictions about the future, weight them by their probability, and take action based on the result. If an action leads to bad results with high probability and we do it anyway then we are responsible for that, and don&#x2019;t deserve much sympathy. We rarely go through the explicit predictions and calculations, but this seems to be the general way that our subconscious works.</p><p>But what about looking <em>backward</em> in time? Let&#x2019;s say I decide not to train because I think it is unlikely I will be attacked, and then I get attacked anyway. Was this purely bad luck, or was my prediction wrong? How can we tell the difference?</p><p>Depending on the perspective you take you can get pretty different answers. Random street violence is quite rare in my city, so from that perspective my prediction was correct. Hindsight is a funny thing though, because in hindsight I <em>know</em> that I was attacked; in hindsight probabilities tend to collapse to either 0 or 1. And knowing that I was attacked, I can start to look for clues that it <em>was</em> predictable. Maybe I realize that, while street violence is rare in the city overall, I live in a particularly bad neighbourhood. Or maybe I learn that while it&#x2019;s rare most of the time, it spikes on Tuesdays, the day when I normally go for a stroll. If I&#x2019;d known these things initially, then I would have predicted a much higher probability of being attacked. Perhaps in that case I would have decided to train, or even take other mitigating steps like moving to a different neighbourhood. Who knows.</p><p>What this ultimately means, is that I can only possibly be responsible for being hurt in the attack if I&#x2019;m somehow responsible for <em>failing to predict that attack.</em> I&#x2019;m only responsible if for some reason I &#x201C;should have known better&#x201D;.</p><h2>Taking Responsibility for our Predictions</h2><p><em>[I should take this opportunity to remind people that this is all hypothetical. I was not attacked. I&#x2019;m just too lazy to keep filling the language with extra conditional clauses.]</em></p><p>At this point I&#x2019;ve already diverged slightly from the orthodox position. A large number of people would argue that my attacker is solely responsible for attacking me, and that I should accept no blame in this scenario. This certainly seems true from the perspective of law, and justice. But in this essay I&#x2019;m focused on outcomes, not on justice; ultimately I experienced significant pain, pain that I could have avoided had I made better predictions and thus taken better actions.</p><p>Let&#x2019;s return to the issue of whether or not I can be held responsible for failing to predict the attack. There is a continuum here. In some scenarios, the danger I was in should have been obvious, for example if my real-estate agent warned me explicitly about the neighbourhood when I moved in. In these scenarios, it seems reasonable to assign some blame to me for making a bad prediction. In other scenarios, there was really no signal, no warning; the attack was truly a stroke of random bad luck and even in hindsight I don&#x2019;t see a way that I could have done better. In these scenarios, I take no responsibility; my prediction was reasonable, and I would make the same prediction again.</p><p>As with most things, practical experience tells me that real-world situations tend to fall somewhere in the middle. Nobody&#x2019;s hitting you over the head with a warning, but neither is the danger utterly unpredictable; if you look closely enough, there are always signs. It is these scenarios where I think that my intuition fundamentally deviates from the norm. When something bad happens to me, then I <em>default</em> to taking responsibility for it, and I think that&#x2019;s the correct thing to do.</p><p>Of course, there are times when whatever it is <em>is</em> my fault in an uncontroversial way, but I&#x2019;m not talking about those. I&#x2019;m talking about things like getting attacked on the street, or being unable to finish a work project on time because somebody unexpectedly quit. These are the kind of things that I expect most people would say are &#x201C;not my fault&#x201D;, and I do understand this position. However, I think that denying our responsibility for these failures is bad, because it causes us to <em>stop learning</em>. Every time we wave away a problem as &#x201C;not our fault&#x201D; we stop looking for the thing we could have done better. We stop growing our knowledge, our skills, our model of the world. We stagnate.</p><p>This sounds really negative, but we can frame it in a much more positive way: that there&#x2019;s always something to learn, and that we should always try to be better than we were. What I think gets lost for a lot of people is that this not a casual use of &#x201C;always&#x201D;. Even in failures that are not <em>directly</em> our fault, there is still something to learn, and we should still use it as an opportunity to grow. Unless we perfectly predicted the failure and did everything we could to avoid or mitigate it, there is still something we could have done better. Denying our responsibility for our bad predictions is abdicating our ability to grow, change, or progress in life. Where does this leave us?</p><p>Any good Stoic will tell you that when something goes wrong, the only thing we have control over is our reaction, and this applies as much to how we assign responsibility as to anything else. We are responsible for the fate of our future self, and the only way to discharge that responsibility is to learn, grow, and constantly get better. The world is full of challenges. If we do not strive to meet them, we have no-one to blame but ourselves.</p>",,,,

If the post feels a bit dated, that&apos;s why.</em></p><p>Politics is seen as the <u><a href=""http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Politics_is_the_Mind-Killer"">mindkiller</a></u>. Alyssa Vance from <u><a href=""http://rationalconspiracy.com/"">http://rationalconspiracy.com</a></u> argues:</p><blockquote>Politics is suspicious as the best means to ends for other reasons. [...] It&#x2019;s also zero-sum, and extremely competitive. So much human and social capital is going there already, yours probably won&#x2019;t make a dent.</blockquote><p>Is that true? Is it impossible for the very smart person without much resources to make a dent?</p><p>Years ago I was talking with someone from an East European country about how they demonstrate to get rid of their government. When asked for a detailed background on the reasons of why the particular government should go they said that the reasons aren&apos;t well described by any English source.</p><p>I suggested that instead of spending their time being the 10,001 person attending a demonstration they should write up the reasons why the government is bad in a detailed manner and publish it in the Guardian&apos;s Comment is free section.</p><p>In that case, knowledge of the politics of the country and good writing skills would have been enough to make a dent.</p><p>When it comes to whether their government steps down, obviously it matters how other countries see the situation in the country. For someone who thinks that the government should step down, it should be obvious that it&apos;s important that the best reasons why the government should step down should be available in English.</p><p>If you look at how Mubarak lost political power in Egypt, people in the West who thought their media informed them didn&apos;t really understand the situation.</p><p>They were unaware of the relevant politics. They didn&apos;t know that according to <u><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/171176"">US embassy cables released by wikileaks</a></u>:</p><blockquote>Academics and civilian analysts painted a portrait of an Egyptian military in intellectual and social decline, whose officers have largely fallen out of society&apos;s elite ranks. They describe a disgruntled mid-level officer corps harshly critical of a defense minister they perceive as incompetent and valuing loyalty above skill in his subordinate</blockquote><p>The Egyptian military runs part of the Egytian economy. The IMF pushed for typical Washington Consensus policies and as a result a lot of private business came into Egypt and made money. What happened to the military?</p><p>Lee Sustar wrote in February  2011 <u><a href=""http://socialistworker.org/2011/02/03/roots-of-egypts-uprising"">The roots of Egypt&apos;s uprising</a></u>:</p><blockquote>The top military brass, however, hasn&apos;t cashed in on Egypt&apos;s economic growth to the same extent as private businesses. Indeed, military officials see the privatization of state-owned enterprises as a threat to their economic standing and political clout.</blockquote><p>If you look at that situations it much easier to understand why the Military didn&apos;t do something against the protesters that brought down Mubarak but now takes strong measures against the Muslim brotherhood. The West wanted to see the fall of Mubarak as a sign that democracy won instead of seeing it as a sign that the military got what they wanted.</p><p>Why does that matter to someone who wants to create political change? It shows that the general public is horribly informed about what goes on in the political sphere. </p><p>Before Bradley Manning submitted files to Wikileaks, Wikileaks dealt with information about corruption in Kenya. By leaking the <u><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/aug/31/kenya.topstories3"">Kroll report</a></u> they <u><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=HNOnvp5t7Do"">contributed</a></u> significantly to a different party winning the 2007 election. </p><p>Why do those examples from Egypt, Kenya and East Europe matter? You might say, of course people who spread information can change things in those countries but what about the USA?</p><p>If that sentiment resonates with you it should make you think about whether the USA is democratic in a meaningful way. Democracy is about citizens being able to affect the political process through free speech.</p><p>Why might you think such a thing? To be a politician in the US congress you need to gather a lot of money from donors. The Democratic party recommends that new US congressmen spend 4 hours of their day raising money. Fortunately, in practice the amount of time seems to be not that <u><a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/07/29/congress-spends-too-much-time-fundraising-but-its-less-time-than-you-think/"">extreme</a></u>. After all, fundraising isn&apos;t fun. </p><p>The problem is that it&apos;s not easy to reach politicians directly. A lot of people try it and it&apos;s going to be hard to get sufficient attention from a US congressman to explain to him in detail why a certain policy is wrong. </p><p>What options do we actually have to create political change? Julian Assange had arguably a large political impact given that he&apos;s a single person who&apos;s not that rich.</p><p>What&apos;s his self professed goal? Justice. Defining justice itself isn&apos;t an easy task. We can however observe that sometimes there are groups that do something that isn&apos;t in the interest of the broad public. </p><p>If one member of a group of 100 people thinks that the group is engaging in injustice that is a valuable data point. Groups where every member thinks the group is doing good should be able to outcompete groups where some members think the group engages in injustice.</p><p>That&apos;s where Assange comes into play. He wants to empower that single individual that thinks the group is injust. Assange also made the observation that if a group spends a large amount of resources on keeping certain information secret that corresponds to the harm that the group will suffer should the information become public. </p><p>He makes the further observation that if it&apos;s possible for a single individual who thinks that a group is unjust to bring down the whole group, members of the group won&apos;t share all information with each other anymore. When it becomes harder to share information inside the group the group has to effectively pay a secrecy tax. That means that the group is less effective in its battle against other groups in society that don&apos;t have to pay that tax because their members believe in their course.</p><p>Assange articulated that theory with using graph theory in a paper titled <u><a href=""http://cryptome.org/0002/ja-conspiracies.pdf"">Conspiracy as Governance</a></u> in 2006. From there he goes to accept every whistleblower that wants to contribute an internal document. He founded Wikileaks for that purpose. In some sense you could say that he took the idea that &quot;everything that can be destroyed by truth, shall be&quot; very <u><a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/2l6/taking_ideas_seriously/"">seriously</a></u>.</p><p>What is the problem with that political theory of change? It&apos;s not that it is ineffectual. It&apos;s that it is powerful enough that you get into problems. Assange made some powerful people really angry and as a result he spent years in the Ecudaorian embassy and is now imprisoned under conditions with are called torture in the <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30383-4"">Lancet</a>. </p><p>I personally don&apos;t want to do that kind of politics. I don&apos;t want to attack other groups in a manner which endangers myself. That&apos;s my conscious choice. The founding fathers of the US payed the price of their victory in blood. But how do you do effective politics without harming yourself? To answer that question it&apos;s useful to look at the foundation of our current political orthodoxy.</p><p>Milton Friedman wrote in the 1982 preface of <em>Capitalism and Freedom</em></p><blockquote><strong>Only a crisis&#x2014;actual or perceived&#x2014;produces real change. When that crisis occurs, the actions that are taken depend on the ideas that are lying around.</strong> That, I believe, is our basic function: to develop alternatives to existing policies, to keep them alive and available until the politically impossible becomes politically inevitable.</blockquote><p>Milton Friedman developed a lot of political policy ideas that had a big impact. He knew that you can&apos;t just go and demand the government to change. Usually the government changes when there some form of crisis. When in crisis mode politicians want to be seen as doing something about the crisis.</p><p>As I wrote above, politicians don&apos;t really want to engage in hard work. That means that someone else often needs to have done the intellectual legwork beforehand. Politicans seek experts and then take the policy ideas from those experts.</p><p>Friedman and a lot of think tanks specialised into developing detailed policy proposals. These days there are think tanks that provide ready made bills. A congressman can just take the bill and copy paste it without having to do any work. </p><p>Thinks tanks have the advantage that they can spend money on feasible developing model bills. </p><p>We however have seen that Wikipedia managed to outcompete the Encyclopedia Britanica. There in principle nothing that stops a smart programmer from building a platform that provides for model bills that change society for the better.</p><p>The hard part will be around getting contributors to focus on practical effects of policies and move beyond idealism.</p><p>Some demands just aren&apos;t realistic and have no chance of being implemented. On the other hand I think there a lot of room for smart policies that are simply superior to existing policies. </p><p>Once you talk about whether different policy tools work, you also have a discussion that&apos;s a lot less mind-killed.</p><p>In building such a tool you have to make certain choices. You can build it as a hosted website. You can also build it as a distributed platform that runs on home computers.</p><p>Given that you don&apos;t want outside interference from NSA, you want a distributed architecture.</p><p>Why do these thoughts matter, even if you don&apos;t want to invest a significant amount of time into politics? Many readers of LessWrong are software engineers or move in the startup space. As such they are in a position to make important architecture choices. When deciding whether or not a software that you design relies on a central US server that stores all user data you are making a political choice.</p><p>I don&apos;t want to say that cloud architecture is inherently politically wrong but if the only reason you decide for a cloud architecture is because it&apos;s a cool buzzword, you are doing political evil. If you then complain that congress doesn&apos;t implement your pet political idea, you should look at yourself and judge the extent to which you are part of the problem.</p><p>Whenever you make big architecture choices in software that affect society you should think in detail about how that will change the power balance in society. Commenting on random reddit posts about the evil of software patents isn&apos;t being politically active. </p><p>To the extent that LessWrong is full of intelligent 20-somethings I would predict that in 10 years people of this group will be in positions to make influential architecture choices. The only way to make those responsible is to understand the political effects. </p><p>But what about those things that aren&apos;t in your direct sphere of effect? Think about policies. Even if you don&apos;t have a ready-made bill that a congressman can copy and paste, ideas about policy are important.</p><p><u><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EewGMBOB4Gg"">Zeitgeist Addendum</a></u> is for example a political movie that opposes the status quo. It has some popularity according to some people who hate the status quo. Even if you disagree that the status quo is bad the policy ideas that the movie pushes are dangerous.</p><p>One of them is that all economic decisions should be made by a &quot;scientifically&quot; designed central computer who knows what&apos;s best for everyone. What about the problem of people not wanting to do what the central computer tells them? People only would do that if they are selfish, and people who get the right education won&apos;t be selfish and thus work for the common good and recognize that it&apos;s the common good to do what the &quot;scientifically&quot; designed central computer tells them to do.</p><p>Here we know about the problems of FAIs, however many people on the internet don&apos;t. Because of lack of well argued alternatives to the status quo they might follow insane ideologies like the one articulated in Zeitgeist Addendum. Unfortunately I have seen smart people advocate Zeitgeist Addendum as a means of being contrarian.</p><p>Mencius Moldbug effective at changing political opinions despite not writing in a way that optimized for attracting a large audience. Moldbug is right when he argues that most people don&apos;t understand politics. Moldbug solution of rolling back all social progress is still bad. You can meaningfully say that ending slavery was good. The case goes for legalising homosexuality. </p><p>I don&apos;t have a good answer of what our political system should look like. But I do think that&apos;s an important question. Discussing it is worthwhile. If we find a design that nicely fits together there are a lot of people who hate the status quo and who gladly take your political philosophy if they don&apos;t have to do the leg work of thinking up the fundamentals themselves. </p>",ChristianKl,christiankl,ChristianKl,

DAc4iuy4D3EiNBt9B,How to evaluate (50%) predictions,how-to-evaluate-50-predictions,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/DAc4iuy4D3EiNBt9B/how-to-evaluate-50-predictions,2020-04-10T17:12:02.867Z,134,67,50,False,False,,"<p>I commonly hear (sometimes from very smart people) that 50% predictions are meaningless. I think that this is wrong, and also that saying it hints at the lack of a coherent principle by which to evaluate whether or not a set of predictions is meaningful or impressive. Here is my attempt at describing such a principle.</p><h2>What are predictions?</h2><p>Consider the space of all possible futures:</p><span><figure><img src=""https://s12.directupload.net/images/200409/447ifluc.png"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:20%""></figure></span><p>If you make a prediction, you do this:</p><span><figure><img src=""https://s12.directupload.net/images/200409/by9i4ne8.png"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:20%""></figure></span><p>You carve out a region of the future space and declare that it occurs with some given percentage. When it comes to evaluating the prediction, the future has arrived at a particular point within the space, and it should be possible to assess whether that point lies inside or outside of the region. If it lies inside, the prediction came true; if it lies outside, the prediction came false. If it&apos;s difficult to see whether it&apos;s inside or outside, the prediction was ambiguous.</p><span><figure><img src=""https://s12.directupload.net/images/200409/zr32ue7a.png"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:40%""></figure></span><p>Now consider the following two predictions:</p><ul><li>A coin I flip comes up heads (50%)</li><li>Tesla&apos;s stock price at the end of the year 2020 is between 512$ and 514$ (50%)</li></ul><p>Both predictions have 50% confidence, and both divide the future space into two parts (as all predictions do). Suppose both predictions come true. No sane person would look at them and be equally impressed. This demonstrates that confidence and truth value are not sufficient to evaluate how impressive a prediction is. Instead, we need a different property that somehow measures &apos;impressiveness&apos;. Suppose for simplicity that there is some kind of baseline probability that reflects the common knowledge about the problem. If we represent this baseline probability by the size of the areas, then the coin flip prediction can be visualized like so:</p><span><figure><img src=""https://s12.directupload.net/images/200409/gsyx747a.png"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:20%""></figure></span><p>And the Tesla prediction like so:</p><span><figure><img src=""https://s12.directupload.net/images/200409/ffhyc7ta.png"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:21%""></figure></span><p>The coin flip prediction is unimpressive because it assigns 50% to a subset of feature space whose baseline probability is also 50%. Conversely, the Tesla prediction is impressive because it assigns 50% to a subset of future space with a tiny baseline probability. Thus, the missing property is the &quot;boldness&quot; of the prediction, i.e., the<em> (relative) difference between the stated confidence and the baseline probability.</em></p><p>Importantly, note that we can play the same game at every percentage point, e.g.:</p><ul><li>A number I randomize on random.org falls between 15 and 94 &#x2013; 80%</li></ul><p>Even though this is an 80% prediction, it is still unimpressive because there is no difference between the stated confidence and the baseline probability.</p><span><figure><img src=""https://s12.directupload.net/images/200409/nqcmo4gl.png"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:21%""></figure></span><h2>What&apos;s special about 50%?</h2><p>In January, Kelsey Piper predicted that <a href=""https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/1/13/21055740/trump-reelection-biden-nomination-brexit-2020-predictions"">Joe Biden would be the Democratic Nominee with 60% confidence</a>. If this prediction seems impressive now, we can probably agree that this is not so because it&apos;s 60% rather than 50%. Instead, it&apos;s because most of us would have put it much lower than even 50%. For example, <a href=""https://www.electionbettingodds.com/DemPrimary2020.html"">BetFair gave him only ~15% back in March</a>.</p><p>So we have one example where a 50% prediction would have been impressive and another (the random.org one) where an 80% prediction is thoroughly unimpressive. This shows that the percentage being 50% is neither necessary nor sufficient for a prediction being unimpressive. Why, then, do people say stuff like &quot;50% predictions aren&apos;t meaningful?&quot; </p><p>Well, another thing they say is, &quot;you could have phrased the predictions the other way.&quot; But there are reasons to object to that. Consider the Tesla prediction:</p><ul><li>Tesla&apos;s stock price at the end of the year 2020 is between 512$ and 514$ (50%)</li></ul><p>As-is, this is very impressive (if it comes true). But now suppose that, instead of phrasing it in this way, we first flip a coin. If the coin comes up heads, we flip the prediction, i.e.:</p><ul><li>Tesla&apos;s stock price at the end of the year 2020 is below 512$ or above 514$ (50%)</li></ul><p>Whereas, if it comes up tails, we leave the prediction unchanged.</p><span><figure><img src=""https://s12.directupload.net/images/200409/vpf8cgeg.png"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:40%""></figure></span><p>What is the probability that we are correct from the point of view we have before the flip? Well, at some point it will be possible to evaluate the prediction, and then we will either at a point outside of the small blob or at a point inside of the small blob. In the first case, we are correct if we flipped the prediction (left picture). In the latter case, we are correct if we didn&apos;t flip the prediction (right picture). In other words, in the first case, we have a 50% chance of being correct, and in the latter case, we also have a 50% chance of being correct.

Consider what happens when you make and evaluate a swath of predictions. The common way to do this is to group them into a couple of specific percentage points (such as 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 95%, 99%) and then evaluate each group separately. To do this, we would look at all predictions in the 70% group, count how many have come true, and compare that number to the optimum, which is <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""0.7 \cdot \text{# predictions in that group}""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mn""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">0.7</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space2""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.004em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">&#x22C5;</span></span><span class=""mjx-mtext MJXc-space2""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.519em;""># predictions in that group</span></span></span></span></span></span>.</p><p>Now think of such a prediction like this:</p><span><figure><img src=""https://s12.directupload.net/images/200410/a2c9a4ap.png"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:34%""></figure></span><p>Namely, there is a baseline probability (blue pie, ~60%) and a stated confidence (green pie, 70%). When we add such a prediction to our 70% group, we can think of that like so:</p><span><figure><img src=""https://s12.directupload.net/images/200410/rzhot3q9.png"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:33%""></figure></span><p>We accumulate a confidence pile (green) that measures how many predictions we claim will come true, and a common wisdom pile (blue) that measures how many predictions ought to come true according to common wisdom. After the first prediction, the confidence pile says, &quot;0.7 predictions will come true,&quot; whereas the common wisdom pile says, &quot;0.6 predictions will come true.&quot;</p><p>Now we add the second (70% confidence, ~45% common wisdom):</p><span><figure><img src=""https://s12.directupload.net/images/200410/nybl9whf.png"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:33%""></figure></span><p>At this point, the confidence pile says, &quot;1.4 predictions will come true,&quot; whereas the common wisdom pile says, &quot;1.05 predictions will come true.&quot;</p><p>If we keep doing this for all 70% predictions, we eventually end up with two large piles:</p><span><figure><img src=""https://s12.directupload.net/images/200410/xwanhw9t.png"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:23%""></figure></span><p>The confidence pile may say, &quot;70 predictions will come true,&quot; whereas the common wisdom pile may say, &quot;48.7 predictions will come true.&quot;</p><p>Then (once predictions can be evaluated) comes a third pile, the reality pile:</p><span><figure><img src=""https://s12.directupload.net/images/200410/rq6jf8sd.png"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:40%""></figure></span><p>The reality pile counts how many predictions did, in fact, come true. Now consider what this result means. We&apos;ve made lots of predictions at 70% confidence for which common wisdom consistently assigns lower probabilities. In the end, (slightly more than) 70% of them came true. This means we have systematically beaten common wisdom. This ought to be impressive.</p><p>One way to think about this is that the difference between the confidence and common wisdom piles is a measure for the boldness of the entire set of predictions. Then, the rule that [each prediction be phrased in such a way that the confidence is above the baseline probability] is equivalent to choosing one of two ways that maximize this boldness. (The other way would be to invert the rule.)</p><p>If the rule is violated, the group of 70% predictions might yield a confidence pile of a height similar to that of the common wisdom pile. Then, seeing that the reality pile matches them is much less impressive. To illustrate this, let&apos;s return to the example from above. In both cases, assume exactly one of the two predictions comes true.</p><p>Following the rule:</p><ul><li>The price of a barrel of oil at the end of 2020 will be between $50.95 and $51.02 (50%)</li><li>Tesla&apos;s stock price at the end of the year 2020 will be between 512$ and 514$ (50%)</li></ul><span><figure><img src=""https://s12.directupload.net/images/200410/zcfvesa8.png"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:29%""></figure></span><br><span><figure><img src=""https://i.ibb.co/XDKxpsL/19.png"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:30%""></figure></span><p>Bold, therefore impressive. </p><p>Violating the rule:</p><ul><li>The price of a barrel of oil at the end of 2020 will be between $50.95 and $51.02 (50%)</li><li>Tesla&apos;s stock price at the end of the year 2020 will be below 512$ or above 514$ (50%)</li></ul><span><figure><img src=""https://s12.directupload.net/images/200410/zcfvesa8.png"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:29%""></figure></span><br><span><figure><img src=""https://s12.directupload.net/images/200410/xfzklhix.png"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:27%""></figure></span><p>Not bold at all, therefore unimpressive.

If it&apos;s extremely complicated and arbitrary, then it&apos;s probably also hard to model. The projections he saw had the most likely outcome being a moderate win by Hilary, but since he didn&apos;t trust the models, he figured the value was in the tails: the models are likely off, which likely affects the tails more than the mean. So a landslide win by Hilary or a Trump victory seemed undervalued by gambling markets. He wished he could hedge his bets by betting on both outcomes (as opposed to a moderate Hilary win), but the only option he had was to bet on Trump to win.</p><p>This logic has stuck with me ever since: in the face of large uncertainty, we&apos;re probably getting the tails wrong more than the mean.

We just had a huge shift from people eating out to eating in, and now
a lot more people are baking, so we and a lot of people I know have
had trouble finding grocery stores with flour in stock.  The
residential supply chain is struggling to keep up with demand.  On the
other hand, the commercial supply chain is massively under-utilized:
so many restaurants that had been buying 50lb bags of flour regularly
are now buying none.  What if those of us with households that go
through a lot of flour bought some from commercial sources?  Not only
would we have flour, but there would be less pressure on residential
supplies and so more for others as well!

</span>

</p><p>

I looked around, and I found that <a href=""https://www.webstaurantstore.com/"">Webstaurant</a> would ship a
pallet of flour, 50 bags of 50lbs each, for <a href=""https://www.webstaurantstore.com/all-purpose-flour-50-lb/104HR.html"">$1,081</a>
or $0.43/lb.  I wrote to friends, wrote to work mailing lists, posted
on FB, and found other people that were interested.  Enough people
wanted flour that I decided to place the order when it was only about
half accounted for, since I was getting about 10 more people each day.

</p>

<p>

Unfortunately, between placing the order and them shipping it they ran
out of stock:

</p>

</p>

<p>

Not only were they out of the flour I'd ordered, they were out of
all-purpose flour entirely.  I considered ordering high-gluten flour,
since a lot of people wanted flour for making bread, but bread isn't
the only thing people cook and coordinating back with everyone would
be a lot of work.

</p>

<p>

One of my coworkers pointed out that <a href=""https://www.baldorfood.com/"">Baldor</a>, a local specialty foods
distributor, was now making home deliveries as long as you'd order at
least $250 worth.  Their flour was a bit fancier (King Arthur Sir
Galahad, which is commercial King Arthur All-Purpose) and so more
expensive, but their shipping was cheaper so it was still only $0.56/lb.  I
placed an order for 27 bags on Wednesday and wrote to people letting
them know about the change and asking if they wanted to cancel their
order; none of them did.

</p>

<p>

Thursday morning I set an old pallet out on our porch and put plastic
sheeting on it, so I'd be able to fully wrap the bags.  They arrived
an hour later, and they were great about doing a fully contactless
delivery.  They carried the bags up, put them on the pallet, and
left.

</p>

</p>

<p>

I wrapped the bags in plastic to keep them dry and keep animals out:

</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>

I told people they'd arrived, people paid me via paypal/zelle/check,
and people started coming to pick them up.  One thing I hadn't
anticipated was how interested animals would be in the flour, and how
inconsistent people would be about wrapping the bags back up again.
Some people were great, but others weren't.  I wrote to people again
asking them to please pick up today if they could and to be careful
about putting the plastic back, and moved the bags of people who said
they couldn't pick up today ginside.

</p>

<p>

As of this morning I still need four people to pay, and six people to
pick up their bags, so we're in good shape!

And so it&#x2019;s understandable that some of us would ask: &#x201C;Is this a distraction?&#x201D; Surely a crisis that ends many lives pales in comparison to crises that could end all of them.</p><p>However, this line of reasoning might make long-termists lose sight of a large opportunity: we can build XRisk prevention capacity *through* pandemic response efforts. Through fighting COVID-19, we can:</p><p>1. Train ourselves</p><p>2. Forge alliances</p><p>3. Establish credibility</p><p>4. Grow the global risk movement</p><p>5. Create XRisk infrastructure</p><p>I&#x2019;ll go through these by category.</p><h1><strong>Training Ourselves</strong></h1><p>Now that we&#x2019;re dealing with a live global catastrophe, there&#x2019;s a chance to develop our skills and ability to coordinate for future global catastophes.</p><p>Here are some particularly relevant areas for skill growth:</p><p>&#x2022; <strong>Forecasting</strong>: Create predictions of what might happen and be proven right or wrong.</p><p>&#x2022; <strong>Scenario-planning</strong>: Run inside-view and outside-view simulations of your proposed COVID-19 intervention, act accordingly, and then improve your simulation abilities based on what actually happened.</p><p>&#x2022; <strong>Coordination</strong>: Pandemic response efforts will often require that you collaborate with a wide variety of different actors, just like with other global risks.</p><p>&#x2022; <strong>Persuasive argumentation</strong>: This skill can be built through convincing others that your project is worth supporting, or through influencing decision-makers.</p><p>&#x2022; <strong>Networking</strong>: Navigate the complicated world of crisis-response to find others to aid and work with. Your project might require you to form connections with epidemiologists, with front-line responders, with public officials, with manufacturing plants, with fellow activists, and more.</p><p>&#x2022; <strong>Project management</strong>: Develop the ability to set and meet deadlines at a moment when they really matter. Learn how to lead other people. Find and use the best tools for tracking tasks. Document and curate best practices (this can help other projects as well).</p><p>Perhaps the greatest opportunity here is for EAs and rationalists to improve their existing comparative advantage: <strong>applied epistemology</strong>. A live crisis affords epistemic growth opportunities unmatched by many other contexts. You need to work with spotty information and a rapidly unfolding situation. You must process signal from unreliable sources. You need to make decisions over uncertainty.</p><p>This is an opportunity to:</p><p>&#x2022; Get rapid feedback on your decisions and predictions.</p><p>&#x2022; Ground abstract models in concrete experiences.</p><p>&#x2022; Understand how various canonical tools fare in a real-life situation (back-of-envelope calculations, conducting meta-analyses on RCTs, doing reference-class forecasting)</p><p>In other words, it&#x2019;s an opportunity to practice rationality with immediate practical upside.</p><h1><strong>Forging alliances</strong></h1><p>Just about every sector of society is mobilizing itself to fight the pandemic right now. This gives EAs and rationalists an &#x201C;in&#x201D; to form alliances that can be useful for preventing future global risks. In just a few weeks of working on the crisis, my extended network has come to include crisis-response experts, epidemiologists, philanthropic foundations, lobbyists, manufacturing firms, and intelligence community members. </p><p>Let&#x2019;s say you care about AI safety in particular. Some alliances you might forge now include:</p><p>&#x2022; Policy experts at the White House&#x2019;s Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP). OSTP is now <u><a href=""https://www.rollcall.com/2020/03/16/artificial-intelligence-recruited-to-find-clues-about-covid-19/"">working with AI teams</a></u> at Microsoft and Google to analyze thousands of scientific papers on COVID-19. Many policy experts are stretched thin and would value additional research support. And in one notable case I&#x2019;m unable to post publicly, EAs are already offering it!</p><p>&#x2022; Researchers across various AI groups like Deepmind that are working on AI-based pandemic-response initiatives.</p><p>&#x2022; Competent volunteers you meet through activist efforts. For instance, the best initiatives tend to have at least one solid project manager or ops person. Nearly every AI safety initiative benefits from having competent PMs and ops people, so this is a chance to source new talent.</p><h1><strong>Establishing credibility</strong></h1><p>You know what&#x2019;s useful for convincing people that you can competently address a global crisis? Competently addressing a global crisis. Useful resources are given to those who have demonstrated the sorts of prescience and intelligence that EAs and rationalists can demonstrate right now. Credit is already being assigned to rationalists and Silicon Valley people whose public material demonstrated better tracking of the virus than most established institutions. One attempt I like in this direction is <u><a href=""http://epidemicforecasting.org/"">epidemicforecasting.org</a></u> from a team at the Future of Humanity Institute. </p><p>Notable demonstrations of competence on particular problems can often grant more general credibility. E.g., as with Nassim Taleb&#x2019;s prediction of the 2008 financial crisis and Nate Silver&#x2019;s predictions during the 2008 election. </p><p>Conversely, the EA and rationalists communities stand to *lose* credibility for inaction during the pandemic. The optics of tepidly responding to a global crisis after being the community that always ranted about global crises are...not good optics.</p><p>Of course we could also lose credibility by getting in the way of trained professionals during this one. But I believe EAs are pretty good at being helpful instead of hinderful.</p><h1><strong>Growing the global risk movement</strong></h1><p>The category of &#x201C;global catastrophe&#x201D; is no longer just an abstract idea. It&#x2019;s a tangibly experienced reality. This ought ideally make it much easier to get more resources devoted to GCRs and XRisks in the future.</p><p>It is easy to imagine useful movement-building efforts. For example, now would be a good time to volunteer as marketing staff for Toby Ord&#x2019;s new book, <u><a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/04/01/book-review-the-precipice/"">The Precipice</a></u>.</p><p>With this crisis, there may be the potential to cause larger culture-shifts. Historians speculate that the Enlightenment emerged from the Thirty Years War and that the Renaissance emerged from the Plague. This new plague offers an opportunity for shifting culture toward a new renaissance &#x2013; ideally one which has long-termism as a central value.</p><p>Importantly, this may not happen automatically. It&#x2019;s possible that we&#x2019;ll miss the opportunity to draw the connection between COVID-19 and the broader category of global risk. It&#x2019;s also very possible that the broader culture will fail to blame COVID-19 in part on short-termism, and miss out on valuing EA ideas around long-termism. Here, we must helpfully intervene.</p><p>Global institutions like the IMF and IBRD emerged from Breton Woods immediately after World War II. Toward the end of the pandemic, there is going to be a short window for policy proposals and new global institutions. Likewise, there will be a limited window where it&#x2019;s possible to introduce narratives that change the broader culture. To meet these windows, we need to start policy and narrative work during the crisis.</p><h1><strong>Creating XRisk infrastructure</strong></h1><p>There are plenty of exciting ideas out there for creating long-term XRisk infrastructure out of COVID-19 but not very many people acting on them. Here are just a few:</p><p>&#x2022; Improving prediction markets: Prediction markets like <u><a href=""https://www.metaculus.com/"">Metaculus</a></u> could benefit from more quality forecasters, increased organizational capacity, and extended influence media (e.g., media coverage and credibility amongst policy-makers).</p><p>&#x2022; Increasing community world-modeling capabilities: This might simply include stimulating more quality analysis via a crisis which requires understanding many relevant parts of the world. Or it might include the building and improvement of tools like <u><a href=""https://www.getguesstimate.com/"">Guesstimate</a></u>.</p><p>&#x2022; Creating prize competitions: One idea I&#x2019;ve seen is creating a prestigious prize like the Nobel for outstanding contributions to global risk reduction. One could start awarding these during the current crisis and build it into an ongoing institution post-crisis. This could make it not only more acceptable, but also widely virtuous to make contributions to global risks such as future pandemics, nuclear war, and AI safety.</p><br><p>In summary, there is ample opportunity to treat COVID-19 as an XRisk capacity-building intervention.

Given that this is a full application, and not merely an interest form, it is one of the venues that I am most optimistic about.

As near as I can tell, it is totally legal to apply for a loan from multiple lenders, so long as you don&#x2019;t <em>accept</em> a loan from multiple lenders.

While many people in the effective altruism movement are vegan, I'm
not, and I wanted to write some about why.  The short answer is what
while I'm on board with the general idea of making sacrifices to help
others I think veganism doesn't represent a very good tradeoff, and I
think we should put our altruistic efforts elsewhere.

</span>

</p><p>

There are many reasons people decide to eat vegan food, from ethics to
taste to health, and I'm just interested in the ethical perspective.
As a consequentialist, the way I see this is, how would the world be
different if I stopped eating animals and animal products?



</p>

<p>

One factor is that I wouldn't be buying animal products anymore, which
would reduce the demand for animals, and correspondingly the amount
supplied.  <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticity_(economics)"">Elasticity</a>
means that if I decrease by buying by one unit I expect production to
fall by less than one unit, but I'm going to ignore that here to be
on the safe side.  Peter Hurford <a href=""http://everydayutilitarian.com/essays/how-much-suffering-is-in-the-standard-american-diet/"">gives</a>
a very rough set of numbers for how many animals continuously living are required to
support a standard American diet and gets:

</p>

<ul>
<li>1/8 of a cow</li>
<li>1/8 of a pig</li>
<li>3 chickens</li>
<li>3 fish</li>
</ul>

For example, a typical American consumes about a quarter of a pig per
year, and these pigs live about six months, so that's 1/8 of a pig on
an ongoing basis.  I haven't checked his numbers in detail, but there
are 

<a href=""https://downloads.usda.library.cornell.edu/usda-esmis/files/rj430453j/ff365q57t/j9602k41w/hgpg0320.txt"">78M</a>
pigs and 327M people in the US, so one pig for every four people, and
once you consider that we 

<a href=""https://www.statista.com/statistics/194708/us-total-pork-imports-and-exports-since-2001/"">export
a lot of pork</a> this seems in the right range.



<p>

Now, I don't think animals matter as much as humans.  I think there's
a very large chance they don't matter at all, and that there's just no
one inside to suffer, but to be safe I'll assume they do.  If animals
do matter, I think they still matter substantially less than humans,
so if we're going to compare our altruistic options we need a rough
exchange rate between animal and human experience. Conditional on
animals mattering, averting how many animal-years on a factory farm do I see as
being about as good as giving a human another year of life?

</p>

<p>

</p>

<ul>
<li>Pigs: about 100.  Conditions for pigs are
very bad, though I still think humans matter a lot more.</li>
<li>Chickens: about 1,000.  They probably matter much less than pigs.</li>
<li>Cows: about 10,000.  They probably matter about the same as pigs,
but their conditions are far better.</li>
<li>Fish: about 100,000.  They matter much less than chickens.</li>
</ul>

These are very rough, and this is the main place where I think I
differ from most ethical vegans: I think humans matter much more than
these animals.  Your own views may also be different!



<p>

Overall this has, to my own personal best guess, giving a person
another year of life being more valuable than at least 230 Americans
going vegan for a year.

</p>

<p>

The <a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/how-bad-is-dairy"">last time I wrote about this</a> I
used $100 as how much it costs to give someone an extra year of life
through a donation to GiveWell's top charities, and while I haven't
looked into it again that still seems about right.  I think it's
likely that you can do much better than this through donations aimed
at reducing the risk of human extinction, but is a good figure for
comparison.  This means I'd rather see someone donate $43 to
GiveWell's top charities than see 100 people go vegan for a year.

</p>

<p>

Since I get much more than $0.43 of enjoyment out of a year's worth of
eating animal products, veganism looks like a <a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/effective-altruism-and-everyday-decisions"">really bad altruistic
tradeoff</a> to me.

(Base rate estimates at the end.)</p><h1>Significant external amounts of pathogen</h1><p>The three main sources of these illnesses are food, fauna, and fecal.</p><p>Food poisoning can be caused by lots of different types of bacteria. For example, Campylobacter, Clostridium, Staphylococcus, and E. Coli seem to be some of the main culprits, but there are many others (and <u><a href=""https://www.medscape.com/answers/175569-114358/what-is-the-prevalence-of-food-poisoning-in-the-us"">80% of cases</a></u> appear to be caused by agents we haven&#x2019;t identified!). These present like &quot;stomach flu&quot;, often for 1-6 days after 1-10 days of incubation.</p><p><u><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5319273/"">Apparently</a></u> a lot of the diseases dogs spread overlap with food poisoning bacteria (and even norovirus, which also presents as stomach flu). </p><p>A lot of fecal-to-oral infections <u><a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=fecal+to+oral+infections&amp;oq=fecal+to+oral+infections&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.2862j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8"">appear</a></u> to be from similar bacteria. (Edited for clarity) For the purposes of this post, we&apos;re ignoring diseases from <em>other people&#x2019;s </em>fecal matter, and some of these are obviously spread person-to-person, like adenovirus. But the four listed above (can I call them the Big Four since they keep coming up?) appear to naturally occur in the lower digestive tract, so you can presumably self-contract them unless there&#x2019;s some effect where you have serious immunity to the specific strains in yourself.</p><p>There are at least some others.</p><ul><li><u><a href=""https://www.medscape.com/answers/300341-32569/what-causes-fungal-pneumonia"">Fungal pneumonia</a></u> looks pretty nasty</li><li>Streptococcus A is usually spread person-to-person but is also <u><a href=""https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/technical-documents/articles/analytix/streptococci-overview.html"">found on the skin</a></u> and <u><a href=""https://www.jstor.org/stable/30084790?seq=1"">regularly causes food poisoning</a></u> and can thus probably be acquired from oneself</li><li>Mold and &#x201C;stuff in dirt&#x201D; also seem like prominent options, though maybe mostly minor symptoms</li><li>Allergies are definitely minor but can mimic colds in some circumstances</li></ul><p>In general these external infections seem mostly bacterial, since fungi are typically too weak to cause noticeable illness, and viruses mostly need other humans to reproduce unless they have animals. Not sure how many protozoans are in this group: I&#x2019;d think lots, but haven&#x2019;t heard of any.</p><h1>Minor internal amounts of pathogen</h1><p>This is the category for a bunch of weird things that may compound on each other, which you don&#x2019;t really find much about in the medical literature.</p><p>The factors I see here are:</p><ol><li>Fluctuating native pathogens</li><li>Variation in immune function</li><ol><li>Between people</li><li>From health</li><li>As calibration to ambient disease risk</li></ol></ol><p>As an example, you have a bunch of candida yeast on and in your body, not very deep because high temperature harms it. It is sometimes but very rarely invasive (<u><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4292074/"">maybe because mammals are specifically warm-blooded to fight fungi!</a></u>). But in immunocompromised individuals, especially AIDS patients, suddenly invasive infections become vastly more common, and many of them have 50+% mortality. But they aren&#x2019;t <em>constant</em>, so this must be responding to various fluctuations in candida infectiousness and immune function.</p><p>Obviously variation in immune function also applies to the external pathogen sources from the above section, but the application to native pathogens is especially interesting. Is it plausible that immune function has a wide enough range of function that internal pathogen sources may cause a significant number of flare-ups in various circumstances much less extreme than AIDS?</p><p>Here&#x2019;s the pitch for plausibility.</p><p>Native pathogens are bacterial (especially the Big Four), fungal, and <u><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_virome"">viral</a></u>; mostly they&#x2019;re on the surface of skin or mucosal membranes, but there is some penetration and humans may have a fair amount of internal viral load. We know highly-immunocompromised people regularly become infected by these native pathogens. But if normal people undergoing fluctuations in their viral load or immune function from health had these flare-ups, I don&#x2019;t think they&#x2019;d be very distinguishable from colds or stomach flu. To further complicate things, I think it&#x2019;s a reasonable hypothesis that your body may calibrate its immune response to what seems like the ambient disease load of your environment. Thus in times of high disease load you may have immunosensitivity and &#x201C;sicknesses&#x201D; from large immune response to small pathogen challenge (similar to immunosensitivity from allergies), and in times of low disease load you may be &#x201C;immunodesensitized&#x201D; and be at higher risk of infection. Evidence for a high rate of phantom colds, or partial viral colds being replaced by self-infection, seems extremely hard to come by, and I don&#x2019;t think the absence of evidence is much evidence of absence. </p><p>Lastly, there&#x2019;s some chance with such a large virome that chronic flare-ups may be more common than we think. Herpes is a classic. But other diseases may just be finicky: <u><a href=""https://about-campylobacter.com/campylobacter-symptoms-risks"">supposedly</a></u> 2-10% of Campylobacter bacterial infections have sequelae or chronic presentation. <u><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3321893/"">One highly-immunocompromised boy</a></u> was shedding influenza A from his stool for &gt;2 months and from his respiratory secretions for &gt;1 year, strongly hinting at some sort of chronic infection even though influenza A is supposed to be incapable of this. <u><a href=""https://mecfsroadmap.altervista.org/?fbclid=IwAR2lwmhc6P2LP-bO6fszELkLvC7AXlWnuFhlUL3zpzWp3KTFAlXg9syA4eM"">At least a few people</a></u> now think chronic viral infections are a common cause of chronic fatigue syndrome, perhaps from mutation to <u><a href=""https://www.me-pedia.org/wiki/Non-cytolytic_enterovirus"">non-cytolytic form</a></u> or <u><a href=""https://forums.phoenixrising.me/threads/dr-martin-lerners-abortive-infection-theory-of-me-cfs-unifying-herpesvirus-enterovirus-me-cfs.55986/"">abortive infection</a></u>. Probably non-cytolytic ones are too weak to cause flare-ups, but this is the kind of weird edge case that, after realizing it&#x2019;s very difficult to obtain evidence against, makes me wonder if viruses do lots of weird stuff we just haven&#x2019;t classified yet. (Adenovirus-36 <u><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4517116/"">may cause</a></u> a lot of obesity, h/t Adam Scholl&#x2014;that should probably make us pause and consider the state of our knowledge.) </p><h1>Base rates and takeaways</h1><p>This is all somewhat useless without base rates that can help us infer how likely it is that our quarantine has failed vs we&#x2019;re just letting food sit out too long. Unfortunately, it&#x2019;s very difficult to get base rates on what we care about, so I&#x2019;m going to have to resort to a lot of hand-waving.</p><p>A sampling of those that were reported: E. Coli infections are at <u><a href=""https://epi.dph.ncdhhs.gov/cd/diseases/ecoli.html"">0.1%/yr</a></u> in the US. Supposedly food poisoning is <u><a href=""https://www.medscape.com/answers/175569-114358/what-is-the-prevalence-of-food-poisoning-in-the-us"">15%/year</a></u>. Norovirus is about <u><a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/trends-outbreaks/burden-US.html"">5%/year</a></u>, but probably most of that is person-to-person. Infections from pets are supposedly <u><a href=""https://www.aafp.org/afp/2007/1101/p1314.html"">1%/year</a></u>, but most aren&#x2019;t serious. For comparison, flu is usually <u><a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html"">3-15%/year</a></u>.</p><p>Stomach-flu-like symptoms will be at least the food poisoning cases plus other cases. That&#x2019;s 15+%. If we relax from intensive cases to include the kind of minor confusing nausea I get once a year, I&#x2019;d guess the rate goes up to about once/year based on personal experience. If there is weird immune modulation, I could see this being once per few months.</p><p>Common-cold-like symptoms don&#x2019;t seem to come up aside from immune modulation, allergies, and supposedly very-low-base-rate things like strep on skin. Healthy people probably have skin virus infection rates like .001-1%. Standard partially-immunocompromised people (that just get sick more than normal) may be more like .005-5%. I&#x2019;d guess weird immune modulation could take that number to 1-200% if it exists (if it were more than 2x/year I&#x2019;d think people would start noticing). But there&#x2019;s also allergies, mold, stuff I&#x2019;ve missed, and all these exacerbated by overreaction to immune challenges. Empirically, I have ~~thrice a year that I seem like I&#x2019;m just starting to get sick and it turns out to be allergies or goes away mysteriously, and I think most people probably have this less but some have it substantially more. I could imagine this rate being like 5x if my body was on high alert, and even a few times a year the symptoms mimicking an actual mild cold rather rather than a tease. </p><p>Of course, if your body can&#x2019;t pick up on external disease cues very well, or it only does so with respect to actual ambient pathogen load rather than leading mental indicators like disgust integration or anxiety tracking, then probably these base rates go down. If you&#x2019;re someone who gets sick a lot, they might be higher.</p><p>So I expect base rates of minor flu-like symptoms not contracted from another person to be about .1-10/year depending on person, and base rates of minor cold-like symptoms not contracted from another person to also be about .1-20/year depending on person (again, if more, we&#x2019;d see that).</p><p>COVID ambient rates are (my guess) around .1-5% most places (more like 5% in the Bay). If you&#x2019;ve been doing a good quarantine, your rate is probably about the rate it was when you started, e.g. I think I started around .1% and so that is probably about my current rate (I could easily be asymptomatic). <strong>So I think if I were very healthy, my model didn&#x2019;t expect much mental immunomodulation, and I got cold or flu symptoms, I&#x2019;d be about as likely to be seeing a COVID onset as seeing a false alarm. As it stands, being not super healthy and a little more sympathetic to various psychosomatic control theories (writ large, not just placebo), I think it&#x2019;s more like ~10:1 that I&#x2019;m seeing a false alarm. </strong></p><p><strong>Given the fact that these numbers are certainly going to be off by about an order of magnitude, obviously I would still monitor very closely and take thoughtful precautions </strong>that make sense both in worlds where I have COVID and don&#x2019;t have COVID (don&#x2019;t want to give housemates another sickness to make them more susceptible). If I hadn&#x2019;t been as careful with my lockdown I&#x2019;d also consider getting sick as evidence that I should tighten things up a bit where possible. Also, how textbook the symptom match with COVID was would heavily effect this estimate. Etc etc. But I hope this helps you get a handle on how to grapple with these numbers and the implicated policies. </p>",Connor_Flexman,connor_flexman,Connor_Flexman,

Well, we do have electronic voting machines. There are certainly ways to make that possible but could it be done in time and securely?

In this approach nothing changes in the voting process other than reducing the number of people at the polls at any given time -- so the longer period of time for people to cast their vote. Down side is that might require some type of legislation. It would also need to be planned out in advance (by whom?) so everyone knows the date (and perhaps time) when they are allowed to cast their vote.</p><p>[Note, I&apos;ve not offered any reason why or any estimate on if this would be necessary.

As we move in that direction, what becomes the new constraint on technology? This post argues that the constraint is <em>good interfaces</em>, that is, something that allows us to specify what the AI should do. As with most interfaces, the primary challenge is dealing with the discrepancy between the user&apos;s abstractions (how humans think about the world) and the AI system&apos;s abstractions, which could be very alien to us (e.g. perhaps the AI system uses detailed low-level simulations). The author believes that this is the central problem of AI alignment: how to translate between these abstractions in a way that accurately preserves meaning.</p><p>The post goes through a few ways in which we could attempt to do this translation, but all of them seem to only reduce the amount of translation that is necessary: none of them solve the chicken-and-egg problem of how you do the very first translation between the abstractions.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> I like this view on alignment, but I don&apos;t know if I would call it the <em>central</em> problem of alignment. It sure seems important that the AI is <em>optimizing</em> something: this is what prevents solutions like &quot;make sure the AI has an undo button / off switch&quot;, which would be my preferred line of attack if the main source of AI risk were bad translations between abstractions. There&apos;s a longer discussion on this point <strong><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/42YykiTqtGMyJAjDM/alignment-as-translation?commentId=zfv4qGzSmYnSqxKBK"">here</a></strong>.</p><h1>TECHNICAL AI ALIGNMENT </h1><h2>AGENT FOUNDATIONS </h2><p><strong><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/yBdDXXmLYejrcPPv2/two-alternatives-to-logical-counterfactuals"">Two Alternatives to Logical Counterfactuals</a></strong> <em>(Jessica Taylor)</em></p><h2>LEARNING HUMAN INTENT </h2><p><strong><a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.11879"">State-only Imitation with Transition Dynamics Mismatch</a></strong> <em>(Tanmay Gangwani et al)</em> (summarized by Zach): Most existing imitation learning algorithms rely on the availability of expert demonstrations that come from the <em>same</em> MDP as the one the imitator will be evaluated in. With the advent of <strong><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.11248"">adversarial inverse reinforcement learning (AIRL)</a></strong> (<strong><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/ad852629e45a/alignment-newsletter-17"">AN #17</a></strong>), it has become possible to learn general behaviors. However, algorithms such as <strong><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03476"">GAIL</a></strong> (<strong><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/ad852629e45a/alignment-newsletter-17"">AN #17</a></strong>) are capable of learning with just state-information, something that AIRL was not designed for. In this paper, the authors introduce indirect-imitation learning (I2L) to try and merge the benefits of both GAIL and AIRL. The basic sketch of the algorithm is to first use a generalization of AIRL to imitate demonstrations via a buffer distribution and then focus on moving that buffer closer to the expert&apos;s demonstration distribution using a Wasserstein critic, a smoother way to train GAN networks. By combining these two approaches, agents trained with I2L learn how to control Ant in regular gravity and can <em>generalize</em> to perform in simulations with differing parameters for gravity. For the suite of Gym continuous domains, they show consistent advantages for I2L over other algorithms such as GAIL, BCO, and AIRL when parameters such as friction, density, and gravity are changed. </p><p><strong>Prerequisities:</strong> <strong><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07875"">Wasserstein GAN</a></strong></p><p><strong>Read more:</strong> <strong><a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.11248.pdf"">Paper: Learning Robust Rewards With Adversarial</a></strong><br><strong><a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.11248.pdf"">Inverse Reinforcement Learning</a></strong></p><p><strong>Zach&apos;s opinion:</strong> The main contribution in this paper seems to be deriving a new bound so that AIRL can handle state-only imitation learning. The use of indirection via a buffer is also interesting and seems to be a good idea to provide stability in training. However, they did not do an ablation. Overall, it&apos;s aesthetically interesting that this paper is borrowing tricks, such as buffering and Wasserstein critic. Finally, the results seem promising, particularly for the sim-to-real problem. It would be interesting to see a follow-up to gauge whether or not I2L can help bridge this gap.</p><p><strong><a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.05012"">The MineRL Competition on Sample-Efficient Reinforcement Learning Using Human Priors: A Retrospective</a></strong> <em>(Stephanie Milani et al)</em> (summarized by Rohin): This paper reports on the results of the <strong><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.10079"">MineRL competition</a></strong> (<strong><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/894417149126/an-56-should-ml-researchers-stop-running-experiments-before-making-hypotheses"">AN #56</a></strong>), in which participants had to train agents to obtain a diamond in Minecraft using a limited amount of compute, environment interactions, and human demonstrations. While no team achieved this task, one team did make it to the penultimate milestone: obtaining an iron pickaxe.</p><p>The top nine teams all used some form of action reduction: that is, they constrained their agents to only take a subset of all available actions, shaping the space in which the agent had to learn and explore. The top four teams all used some form of hierarchy in order to learn longer &quot;options&quot; that could then be selected from. The second place team used pure imitation learning (and so required <em>no</em> environment interactions), while the eighth and ninth place teams used pure reinforcement learning (and so required <em>no</em> human demonstrations).</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> I was surprised to see pure RL solutions rank in the leaderboard, given the limitations on compute and environment interactions. Notably though, while the second place team (pure imitation) got 42.41 points, the eighth place team (pure RL) only got 8.25 points.</p><p>More generally, I was excited to see an actual benchmark for techniques using human demonstrations: so far there hasn&apos;t been a good evaluation of such techniques. It does seem like Minecraft benefits a lot from hierarchy and action pruning, which we may not care about when evaluating algorithms.</p><p><strong><a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.06066"">Sample Efficient Reinforcement Learning through Learning from Demonstrations in Minecraft</a></strong> <em>(Christian Scheller et al)</em> (summarized by Rohin): This paper explains the technique used by the 3rd place team in the MineRL competition (summarized above). They used behavior cloning to train their neural net on human demonstrations, and then used reinforcement learning (specifically, IMPALA) with experience replay and advantage clipping to improve. There are more details about their architecture and design choices in the paper.</p><h2>HANDLING GROUPS OF AGENTS </h2><p><strong><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/Tdu3tGT4i24qcLESh/equilibrium-and-prior-selection-problems-in-multipolar-1"">Equilibrium and prior selection problems in multipolar deployment</a></strong> <em>(Jesse Clifton)</em> (summarized by Rohin): Consider the scenario in which two principals with different terminal goals will separately develop and deploy learning agents, that will then act on their behalf. Let us call this a <em>learning game</em>, in which the &quot;players&quot; are the principals, and the actions are the agents developed.</p><p>One strategy for this game is for the principals to first agree on a &quot;fair&quot; joint welfare function, such that they and their agents are then licensed to punish the other agent if they take actions that deviate from this welfare function. Ideally, this would lead to the agents jointly optimizing the welfare function (while being on the lookout for defection).</p><p>There still remain two coordination problems. First, there is an <em>equilibrium selection problem</em>: if the two deployed learning agents are Nash strategies from <em>different</em> equilibria, payoffs can be arbitrarily bad. Second, there is a <em>prior selection problem</em>: given that there are many reasonable priors that the learning agents could have, if they end up with different priors from each other, outcomes can again be quite bad, especially in the context of <strong><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/p947tK8CoBbdpPtyK"">threats</a></strong> (<strong><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/598f425b1533/an-86-improving-debate-and-factored-cognition-through-human-experiments"">AN #86</a></strong>).</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> These are indeed pretty hard problems in any non-competitive game. While this post takes the framing of considering optimal principals and/or agents (and so considers Bayesian strategies in which only the prior and choice of equilibrium are free variables), I prefer the framing taken in <strong><a href=""https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2019/10/21/coordination/"">our paper</a></strong> (<strong><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/732eaa192df0/an-70-agents-that-help-humans-who-are-still-learning-about-their-own-preferences"">AN #70</a></strong>): the issue is primarily that the optimal thing for you to do depends strongly on who your partner is, but you may not have a good understanding of who your partner is, and if you&apos;re wrong you can do arbitrarily poorly.</p><h2>FORECASTING </h2><p><strong><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/RvrTZ3qKWpg9aiFqZ/openness-norms-in-agi-development"">Openness Norms in AGI Development</a></strong> <em>(Sublation)</em> (summarized by Rohin): This post summarizes two papers that provide models of why scientific research tends to be so open, and then applies it to the development of powerful AI systems. The <strong><a href=""http://www.strevens.org/research/scistruc/Communicans.pdf"">first</a></strong> models science as a series of discoveries, in which the first academic group to reach a discovery gets all the credit for it. It shows that for a few different models of info-sharing, info-sharing helps everyone reach the discovery sooner, but doesn&apos;t change the probabilities for who makes the discovery first (called <em>race-clinching probabilities</em>): as a result, sharing all information is a better strategy than sharing none (and is easier to coordinate on than the possibly-better strategy of sharing just some information).</p><p>However, this theorem doesn&apos;t apply when info sharing compresses the discovery probabilities <em>unequally</em> across actors: in this case, the race-clinching probabilities <em>do</em> change, and the group whose probability would go down is instead incentivized to keep information secret (which then causes everyone else to keep their information secret). This could be good news: it suggests that actors are incentivized to share safety research (which probably doesn&apos;t affect race-clinching probabilities) while keeping capabilities research secret (thereby leading to longer timelines).</p><p>The <strong><a href=""http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/13452/1/Heesen%202017%20Communism%20and%20the%20Incentive%20to%20Share%20in%20Science%20preprint.pdf"">second paper</a></strong> assumes that scientists are competing to complete a k-stage project, and whenever they publish, they get credit for all the stages they completed that were not yet published by anyone else. It also assumes that earlier stages have a higher credit-to-difficulty ratio (where difficulty can be different across scientists). It finds that under this setting scientists are incentivized to publish whenever possible. For AI development, this seems not to be too relevant: we should expect that with powerful AI systems, most of the &quot;credit&quot; (profit) comes from the last few stages, where it is possible to deploy the AI system to earn money.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> I enjoyed this post a lot; the question of openness in AI research is an important one, that depends both on the scientific community and industry practice. The scientific community is extremely open, and the second paper especially seems to capture well the reason why. In contrast industry is often more secret (plausibly due to <strong><a href=""https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/Patents_-FHI-Working-Paper-Final-.pdf"">patents</a></strong> (<strong><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/9d279b575b1a/an-88-how-the-principal-agent-literature-relates-to-ai-risk"">AN #88</a></strong>)). To the extent that we would like to change one community in the direction of the other, a good first step is to understand their incentives so that we can try to then change those incentives.</p><h2>MISCELLANEOUS (ALIGNMENT) </h2><p><strong><a href=""https://aiimpacts.org/takeaways-from-safety-by-default-interviews/"">Takeaways from safety by default interviews</a></strong> <em>(Asya Bergal)</em> (summarized by Rohin): This post lists three key takeaways from AI Impacts&apos; conversations with &quot;optimistic&quot; researchers (summarized mainly in <strong><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/b3dc916ac7e2/an-80-why-ai-risk-might-be-solved-without-additional-intervention-from-longtermists"">AN #80</a></strong> with one in <strong><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/533c646a4b21/an-63how-architecture-search-meta-learning-and-environment-design-could-lead-to-general-intelligence"">AN #63</a></strong>). I&apos;ll just name the takeaways here, see the post for more details:</p><p>1. Relative optimism in AI often comes from the belief that AGI will be developed gradually, and problems will be fixed as they are found rather than neglected.</p><p>2. Many of the arguments I heard around relative optimism weren&#x2019;t based on inside-view technical arguments.</p><p>3. There are lots of calls for individuals with views around AI risk to engage with each other and understand the reasoning behind fundamental disagreements.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> As one of the people interviewed, these seem like the right high-level takeaways to me.</p><h1>OTHER PROGRESS IN AI </h1><h2>REINFORCEMENT LEARNING </h2><p><strong><a href=""https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2020/04/03/laikago/"">Robots Learning to Move like Animals</a></strong> <em>(Xue Bin Peng et al)</em> (summarized by Rohin): <strong><a href=""http://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2018/10/09/sfv/"">Previous work</a></strong> (<strong><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/df2e472140b6/alignment-newsletter-28"">AN #28</a></strong>) has suggested that we can get good policies by estimating and imitating poses. This work takes this idea and tries to make it work with sim-to-real transfer. Domain randomization would result in a policy that must be robust to all the possible values of the hidden parameters (such as friction). To make the problem easier, they do domain randomization, but give the agent access to (a latent representation of) the hidden parameters, so that its policy can depend on the hidden parameters. Then, to transfer to the real world, they simply need to search over the latent representation of the hidden parameters in order to find one where the policy actually works in the real world. In practice, they can adapt to the real world with just 8 minutes of real world data.</p><p><strong>Read more:</strong> <strong><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00784"">Paper: Learning Agile Robotic Locomotion Skills by Imitating Animals</a></strong></p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> This is a cool improvement to domain randomization: it seems like it should be distinctly easier to learn a policy that is dependent on the hidden parameters, and that seems to come at the relatively low cost of needing just a little real world data.</p><h4><strong>FEEDBACK</strong></h4><p> I&apos;m always happy to hear feedback; you can send it to me, <strong><a href=""https://rohinshah.com/"">Rohin Shah</a></strong>, by <strong>replying to this email</strong>.                         </p><h4><strong>PODCAST</strong></h4><p>An audio podcast version of the <strong>Alignment Newsletter</strong> is available.

No longer accepting new volunteers now.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Results coming soon.</strong></p>

<p>First of all, I want to thank all the volunteers who agreed to do this assessment. It's important to check the track record, especially in a period when expert predictions are so important and so debated. If you have any questions, add a comment here or PM me on LessWrong.</p>
<p>Logistics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to this Google form (asking for your name/pseudonym and email) and I will send you a TSV (tab-separated values) file with all 105 questions in random order.</li>
<li>If you don't want to share your email with me, or share it on a Google form, send me a PM on LessWrong and we'll see what else we can do.</li>
</ul>
<p>Assessment:</p>
<ul>
<li>For each prediction, please answer on a five point scale: 1=True, 2=Weakly True, 3=Cannot decide, 4=Weakly False, 5=False. Use your intuitive assessment of Kurzweil's words if there is ambiguity in them.</li>
<li>Use your best estimate for the <em>accuracy</em> of the prediction only; do not consider how specific or trivial the prediction is. ""People will breath oxygen"" is true; ""there will be a major pandemic in 2018, driving people to quarantine and crashing economies and stock markets"" is false or weakly false, because of the specific date. If it said ""around 2018"", then it would be true or weakly true.</li>
<li>The prediction is true if it was true in 2019; thus, ignore any recent effects of COVID-19.</li>
</ul>
<p>Procedure:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do predictions on the .tsv file I sent you, adding another column.</li>
<li>Do them in the order of that file, starting from the top.</li>
<li>Try and attempt at least 10 predictions.</li>
<li>Some predictions start with a piece in square brackets []. This is to provide context for the prediction. Ignore it when assessing the accuracy.</li>
<li>I'll include the ordered list of predictions as a PDF. Use this if you need yet more context on the prediction.</li>
<li>Once you're done, send me the file back, and I will acknowledge receiving it. If you don't get an acknowledgement in the next two working days, ping me to see if I got it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cheers!</p>

<p>...the science behind The Dress, why some people see it as black and blue, and others see it as white and gold. But it’s also about how the scientific investigation of The Dress lead to the scientific investigation of socks and Crocs, and how the scientific investigation of socks and Crocs may be, as one researcher told me, the nuclear bomb of cognitive neuroscience.</p>

<p>This is a text-to-speech tool that you can use to generate 44.1 kHz voices of various characters. The voices are generated in real time using multiple audio synthesis algorithms and customized deep neural networks trained on very little available data (between 30 15 and 120 minutes of clean dialogue for each character). This project demonstrates a significant reduction in the amount of audio required to realistically clone voices while retaining their affective prosodies.</p>

<p>AI Impacts. <a href=""https://aiimpacts.org/interviews-on-plausibility-of-ai-safety-by-default/"">Interviews on Plausibility of AI Safety by Default</a>. AI Impacts Blog. 2020:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>AI Impacts conducted interviews with several thinkers on AI safety in 2019 as part of a project exploring arguments for expecting advanced AI to be safe by default. The interviews also covered other AI safety topics, such as timelines to advanced AI, the likelihood of current techniques leading to AGI, and currently promising AI safety interventions.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Before taking into account other researchers’ opinions, Shah guesses an extremely rough~90% chance that even without any additional intervention from current longtermists, advanced AI systems will not cause human extinction by adversarially optimizing against humans.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Christiano is more optimistic about the likely social consequences of advanced AI than some others in AI safety, in particular researchers at the Machine Intelligence Research Institute (MIRI)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Gleave thinks there’s a ~10% chance that AI safety is very hard in the way that MIRI would argue, a ~20-30% chance that AI safety will almost certainly be solved by default, and a remaining ~60-70% chance that what we’re working on actually has some impact.</p>

<p>DeepMind. <a href=""https://deepmind.com/blog/article/Agent57-Outperforming-the-human-Atari-benchmark"">Outperforming the Human Atari Benchmark</a>. DeepMind Blog. 2020:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Atari57 suite of games is a long-standing benchmark to gauge agent performance across a wide range of tasks. We’ve developed Agent57, the first deep reinforcement learning agent to obtain a score that is above the  human baseline on all 57 Atari 2600 games. Agent57 combines an algorithm for efficient exploration with a meta-controller that adapts the exploration and long vs. short-term behaviour of the agent.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Agent57 is built on the following observation: what if an agent can learn when it’s better to exploit, and when it’s better to explore? We introduced the notion of a meta-controller that adapts the exploration-exploitation trade-off, as well as a time horizon that can be adjusted for games requiring longer temporal credit assignment. With this change, Agent57 is able to get the best of both worlds: above human-level performance on both easy games and hard games.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In vision, two mixtures, each containing an independent set of many different wavelengths, may produce a common color percept termed “white.” In audition, two mixtures, each containing an independent set of many different frequencies, may produce a common perceptual hum termed “white noise.” Visual and auditory whites emerge upon two conditions: when the mixture components span stimulus space, and when they are of equal intensity.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We conclude that a common olfactory percept, “olfactory white,” is associated with mixtures of ∼30 or more equal-intensity components that span stimulus space, implying that olfactory representations are of features of molecules rather than of molecular identity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>01:12 These simulations represent what’s called an “SIR model”, meaning the population is broken up into three categories, those who are susceptible to the given disease, those who are infectious, and those who have recovered from the infection.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>04:30 The first key takeaway to tuck away in your mind is just how sensitive this growth is to each parameter in our control. It’s not hard to imagine changing your daily habits in ways that multiply the number of people you interact with or that cut your probability of catching an infection in half.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>09:00 A second key takeaway here is that changes in how many people slip through the tests cause disproportionately large changes to the total number of people infected.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>21:22 After making all these, what I came away with more than anything was a deeper appreciation for disease control done right; for the inordinate value of early widespread testing and the ability to isolate cases; for the therapeutics that treat these cases, and most importantly for how easy it is to underestimate all that value when times are good.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>00:00  The goal is for you to come away from this video understanding one of the most important formulas in all of probability, Bayes’ theorem. This formula is central to scientific discovery, it’s a core tool in machine learning and AI, and it’s even been used for treasure hunting, when in the 80’s a small team led by Tommy Thompson used Bayesian search tactics to help uncover a ship that had sunk a century and half earlier carrying what, in today’s terms, amounts to $700,000,000 worth of gold. So it's a formula worth understanding.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>08:44  This is sort of the distilled version of thinking with a representative sample where we think with areas instead of counts, which is more flexible and easier to sketch on the fly. Rather than bringing to mind some specific number of examples, think of the space of all possibilities as a 1x1 square. Any event occupies some subset of this space, and the probability of that event can be thought about as the area of that subset.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes you think you understand something, and when you try to explain it to somebody else, you realize that maybe you gained some new insight that you didn't have before. Maybe you realize you didn't understand it as well as you thought you did. What I think is interesting about this process is that it’s a process of learning by thinking. When you're explaining to yourself or to somebody else without them providing feedback, insofar as you gain new insight or understanding, it isn't driven by that new information that they've provided. In some way, you've rearranged what was already in your head in order to get new insight.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes what we want to do is be persuasive. Sometimes what we want to do is come up with a convenient way for solving a particular type of problem. Again, it might be wrong some of the time, but it's going to be much easier to implement in other cases. There are all sorts of different epistemic and social goals that we might have. Increasingly, I'm thinking that maybe explanation doesn't have just one goal; it probably has multiple goals. Whatever it is, it's probably not just the thing that Bayesian inference tracks. It's probably tracking some of these other things.</p>

<p>00:56  so how are we to reconcile the spread-out wavefunction evolving smoothly under the Schrodinger equation with this point like particle detection
02:23 the outcomes of experiments so the way quantum mechanics came to be understood and the way I learned it is that there are two sets of rules when you're not looking the wave function simply evolves according to the Schrodinger equation but when you are looking when you make a measurement the wavefunction collapses suddenly and irreversibly and the probability of measuring any particular outcome is given by the amplitude of the wave function associated with that outcome squared now shrodinger himself hated this formulation</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>04:54 in this video I want to show that there is a better way to think about Schrodinger's cat in fact a better way to think about quantum mechanics entirely that I'd argue is more logical and consistent to get there we have to examine the three essential components of Schrodinger's cat superposition entanglement and measurement to see if any of them is flawed</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>11:58 the implication is that the founders of quantum theory may have got it exactly backwards the wavefunction is the complete picture of reality and our measurement is just a tiny fraction of it</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If you adhere to a vegan diet, B12 supplementation is prudent. I also recommend having yourself tested for vitamin B12 deficiency every few years. The most appropriate test for evaluating B12 status is the urine test for methylmalonic acid (MMA). Elevated MMA is currently the best tool for detecting vitamin B12 deficiency, and is considered to be superior to testing for serum B12 directly. An alternative and less costly screening blood test is Homocysteine.</p>

<p>00:12  it almost always happens that I encounter the paper videos that have anything from 24 to 30 frames per second. In this case, I put them in my video editor that has a 60 fps timeline, so half or even more of these frames will not provide any new information. As we try to slow down the videos for some nice slow-motion action, this ratio is even worse, creating an extremely choppy output video because we have huge gaps between these frames.</p>

Please see the original document for a fuller explanation. In brief, if 13 of the 16 criteria below are met after a disease makes front-page news, this questionnaire anticipates that we should see a major stock market crash due to the disease. The goal, though, is not precisely to predict that crash. It&apos;s to stimulate discussion so that we don&apos;t behave complacently and have some intellectual tracks laid for assessing the new situation.</p><p>I am testing it by seeing whether it would have rung, and whether it should have, during a set of historical epidemics and pandemics. <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/u9Ei2xM5F5EoQLh7J/would-2009-h1n1-swine-flu-ring-the-alarm-bell"">My first test on 2009 swine flu</a> was as success, as was this second test on the Ebola outbreak of 2014-2016.</p><p><strong>Assessment</strong></p><p><em>Once again, the initial questionnaire performed correctly. The alarm bell should not have rung for Ebola, and indeed it didn&apos;t ring.</em></p><p>Three criteria received a &quot;no&quot; throughout the epidemic. It&apos;s not airborn and there&apos;s no asymptomatic transmission. It also never made it to a significant number of large, industrialized nations. That puts it on the borderline.</p><p>Prior to September or later, the death toll was below the threshold, and it hadn&apos;t yet reached major cities with strong international travel links or led to major economies restricting travel.</p><p>In September, better estimates for overall transmissibility made it no longer comparable with COVID-19. The same month, the first treatment became available.</p><p>Those shifting and coinciding trends mean that there was no month where at least 13/16 criteria were met simultaneously.</p><p>My explanation for why Ebola did not crash the stock market is that it&apos;s a disease with a terrifying case fatality rate, but a transmissibility rate too low to make it a world-shaker. Most of its fatalities were in nations without much economic clout. It&apos;s relatively easy for a well-equipped nation to prevent its spread. The disease is horrible for the affected nations. I think it was probably neglected due to being an African illness, and I&apos;m glad that at least we&apos;ve produced both a treatment and a vaccine for it now.</p><p>Below is my analysis for the questionnaire and the stock market.</p><p><strong>Stock market trends in 2014</strong></p><p>October 2014 market the peak of the Ebola epidemic, although that&apos;s in hindsight. Here&apos;s what the market looked like that year, with mid-October market in red.</p><span><figure><img src=""https://i.imgur.com/SAW4dyK.png"" class=""draft-image "" style=""width:100%""></figure></span><p>Three factors may suggest whether a stock market decline is disease-linked. </p><p><em> 1) It should coincide with significant, ideally pre-registered important moments for the disease, such as peak spread/mortality, or reaching major economies.</em></p><p>Mid-October is in the neighborhood of the Ebola epidemic&apos;s peak, and its introduction to America. I didn&apos;t pre-register these criteria, but they seem significant. We&apos;ll see whether the disease met the criteria from the questionnaire around that time.</p><p><em>2) Contemporary sources should attribute it to the disease with confidence.</em></p><p><a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/17/upshot/heres-what-to-say-when-you-dont-know-why-the-stock-market-fell.html?searchResultPosition=3"">This NYT article from Oct. 16th</a> attributes the dip to a variety of factors including Ebola, but points out that &quot;nobody is entirely sure why the sell-off is so sharp.&quot; <a href=""https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/10/21/market-volatility-merely-a-symptom-of-larger-issues/?searchResultPosition=5"">Here&apos;s another from that period</a> that rambles about Ebola a bit along with other factors to explain the dip. <a href=""https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/10/15/stocks-tumble-on-global-growth-worries/?searchResultPosition=10"">This article</a> chalks up the sell-off to many factors, including but not limited to the virus.</p><p><em>3) In retrospect, the crash should not look like a random walk.</em></p><p>At the bottom of the marked trough, the New York Times was <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/19/business/economy/when-a-stock-market-theory-is-contagious.html?searchResultPosition=2"">speculating about the beginning of a bear market</a>. In hindsight, it looks to me like a random walk.</p><p><strong>Comparison with Coronavirus crash</strong></p><p>For comparison with the Coronavirus crash, here&apos;s 40 years of stock market data for the S&amp;P 500:</p><span><figure><img src=""https://i.imgur.com/2g7Tb89.png"" class=""draft-image "" style=""width:100%""></figure></span><p>Part of the point of the questionnaire is that it gives a benchmark for what we knew about the disease prior to the stock market crash. The purpose of this analysis is to compare it to Ebola and see which should have appeared worse at the time.</p><p>Here&apos;s a selection of articles from the NY Times explaining the stock market from the week of Feb. 20th to Feb. 27th, 2020.</p><p>Feb 20th: <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/20/upshot/coronavirus-stock-market.html?searchResultPosition=2"">Why the Stock Market Isn&#x2019;t Too Worried About Coronavirus</a> (whoopsie!)</p><p>Feb 24th: <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/24/business/stock-market-coronavirus.html?searchResultPosition=15"">U.S. Stocks Plunge as Coronavirus Crisis Spreads</a></p><p>Feb 26th: <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/26/business/stock-market-coronavirus.html?searchResultPosition=7"">Stocks Fall Again as Coronavirus Spreads</a></p><p>Feb 27th: <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/27/business/stock-market-coronavirus.html?searchResultPosition=20"">Coronavirus Fears Drive Stocks Down for 6th Day and Into Correction</a></p><p>All of these articles clearly, confidently attribute the stock market decline to Coronavirus.</p><p>The recent crash is clearly visible, on par with the 2008 recession. It&apos;s one of the three most obvious drops on the whole chart. By contrast, the 2014 mid-October drop is marked by the dotted line, and it&apos;s just fuzz.</p><p><em>It&apos;s clear to me that Ebola did not cause a stock market crash on par with COVID-19, and thus it should not have rung the alarm bell. If the questionnaire is correctly calibrated, Ebola will not meet 13 of 16 criteria simultaneously.</em></p><p><strong>Factor 1: Transmissibility</strong></p><ul><li><em>Does the disease appear to spread from human to human?</em></li></ul><p>Yes.</p><ul><li><em>Does the disease spread via indirect contact (coughing, sneezing)?</em></li></ul><p>No. <a href=""https://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/ebola/06-october-2014/en/"">According to the WHO</a>, the closest it comes is indirect transmission through surfaces. This isn&apos;t what was meant by the original question, as demonstrated by the example &quot;coughing, sneezing.&quot;</p><ul><li><em>Is there any evidence that the disease is transmissible before or just after the start of symptoms?</em></li></ul><p>No, <a href=""https://www.kff.org/infographic/ebola-characteristics-and-comparisons-to-other-infectious-diseases/"">according to KFF.</a></p><ul><li><em>Do any academic papers, especially in the Lancet or the New England Journal of Medicine, suggest the possibility of &quot;risk of much wider spread,&quot; &quot;exponential growth,&quot; or use similar phrases? Try searching &quot;[DISEASE NAME] exponential growth&quot; on Google Scholar.</em></li></ul><p>Another way to answer this is by comparing R0 for COVID-19 and Ebola. <a href=""https://labblog.uofmhealth.org/rounds/how-scientists-quantify-intensity-of-an-outbreak-like-covid-19"">COVID-19&apos;s R0 is estimated around 1.5-3.5</a>. According to a <a href=""https://elifesciences.org/articles/03908"">mid-September 2014 analysis</a>, articles from 2005-2007 had estimated an R0 for Ebola of 1.34-3.65. An R0 greater than 1 implies the potential for pandemic-level spread, and this article questioned why this hadn&apos;t occurred. The article estimated an R0 of 0.94.</p><p>This adds nuance to the criteria. For known diseases, should we use the actual fact of whether it&apos;s caused pandemics in the past, warnings from scientists, or recent R0 values? For this analysis, I will say that prior to mid-September, this criteria was met as a 1.34-3.65 R0 is in the neighborhood of COVID-19 estimates. After that point, the criteria was no longer met.</p><p><strong>Factor 2: Harm</strong></p><ul><li><em>Is there evidence that the disease has a 3% or higher mortality rate among those 60 (or even younger), or 1%+ mortality among those 50 (or younger)?</em></li></ul><p>Yes. <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0399077X1400208X"">A September 2014 meta-analysis</a> put Ebola case fatality rates at 65% on average. <a href=""https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/global-covid-19-case-fatality-rates/"">One recent article</a> estimates COVID-19&apos;s CFR at 0.51%.</p><ul><li><em>Can the disease last for two weeks in more serious cases?</em></li></ul><p>Yes. <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5094140/"">Mean hospitalization times are around 3 weeks for survivors.</a></p><ul><li><em>Do around 5% of patients seem to require hospitalization?</em></li></ul><p><a href=""https://www.healio.com/infectious-disease/emerging-diseases/news/online/%7Bd2a26558-40ac-4949-92e7-e69b146159f1%7D/minimally-symptomatic-cases-show-ebola-outbreak-may-have-been-larger"">Not sure about this source</a>, but there appear to be mild cases of Ebola. This is <a href=""https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article/file?type=printable&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002057"">not a contemporary source</a>, but it estimates that 60% of Ebola cases seek hospitalization. Until I can find a good, contemporary source giving 2014 hospitalization-seeking rates, I&apos;m going to tentatively declare this a yes.</p><ul><li><em>Are there no vaccines or treatments that have been proven effective?</em></li></ul><p>The Ebola vaccine was not approved until 2019. The first treatment for Ebola (serum from convalescent patients) was <a href=""https://www.bmj.com/content/349/bmj.g5539.full.pdf+html"">approved in early September 2014</a>. Because this question is intended to receive a &quot;no&quot; if there is neither a vaccine nor a treatment, it receives a &quot;yes&quot; prior to September 2014 and a &quot;no&quot; after that time.</p><p><strong>Factor 3: Spread</strong></p><ul><li><em>Is the world death toll over 2,000?</em></li></ul><p>Yes. According to <a href=""https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/132834/roadmapupdate8sept14_eng.pdf?sequence=1"">archival WHO situation reports</a>, Ebola crossed this threshold around September 6th.</p><ul><li><em>Has the disease been detected in at least 10 industrialized countries collectively containing a total of at least 1 billion people, found in people with no clear link to the original source?</em></li></ul><p>No. The disease never spread to 10 industrialized countries, and the 10 it did spread to had less than a total of 1 billion people.</p><ul><li><em>Is the disease present in major cities with strong international travel links?</em></li></ul><p>Yes. The clearest example I can find is that one infection was discovered in Dallas, Texas on the 20th of September. I&apos;ll declare this criteria met from that date onward, and may revise to earlier if other clear examples can be found. I may consider revising this to &quot;achieved community spread in major cities with strong international travel links&quot; in a future version of the questionnaire.</p><ul><li><em>Has the disease spread in advance of a lockdown, or escaped it?</em></li></ul><p>Yes. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_African_Ebola_virus_epidemic#United_Kingdom"">Liberia shut its borders</a> with Guinea and Liberia and closed some schools in an attempt to slow the virus in mid-June 2014. <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm63e1114a4.htm?s_cid=mm63e1114a4_w"">By November 2014</a> they had thousands of cases and deaths.</p><p><strong>Factor 4: Institutional response</strong></p><ul><li><em>Has a city-wide lockdown been attempted in a city of a population of at least 10 million, or have travel restrictions to or from major economies been implemented?</em></li></ul><p>Yes. The USA is a major economy (21% of world GDP, over the 2% threshold I established in my <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/u9Ei2xM5F5EoQLh7J/would-2009-h1n1-swine-flu-ring-the-alarm-bell"">swine flu post</a>).

Lots of people in the last month had been really hopeful that even though we really screwed up in the first month or two of this, especially in the United States compared to many other places in the world, that we're the dynamic powerhouse and we're going to fix that and we're going to, therefore, create unprecedented levels of testing and tracing and isolation and we're just going to do a heroic job. And hey, it's our moonshot, it's our World War II and this generation is going to do it. And you know what? That's a hope, it's real and it should be pursued. But we should also be planning for what happens if that doesn't work</p></blockquote><p><i>On the difficulty of making policy proposals</i></p><blockquote><p><strong>Robin:</strong> One of the main problems with trying to make policy proposals, is that... the simplest thing to talk about is the thing that would ultimately happen. But if you're trying to talk about the thing that would ultimately happen, people immediately respond with, ""But look at all the uncertainties. How could you possibly know how to do that right?"" And of course what you really want to propose is that you start down a path that could get to that big thing, but that along that path you would be doing small things that would be telling you all the key things you need to know about how to do the big thing right. Or even whether to quit and don't do the big thing.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> So I am talking about both. I mean, we can't talk about the short things without talking about the big things too, because the whole point of doing the small things is to prepare for, and to lay the groundwork for, the big things. But it's stupid to just pretend like we could know exactly how to do the big things right out from the bat. So in any policy area, including this, this is for all policy whatsoever, you're always talking at these two different levels of trying to imagine the thing you'd eventually do and how that would play out and whether that was a good idea. And then trying to think about what path you would use to get there in terms of what experiments you do, what permission you ask for, what trials you do, and what variations, so that you could learn not only how to do it right, but also create demonstrations and motivation and excitement and energy and attention, such that we might eventually get to the big things.</p></blockquote><p><i>On the potential impact of reducing viral load through deliberate infection</i></p><blockquote><p><strong>Robin:</strong> And surprisingly, given how we have this huge historical precedent of smallpox, there's been very little discussion of this. I should also mention, I initially, six weeks ago, started writing about this in the context of flattening the curve just from the benefit of if you deliberately infect and isolate people, then you infect some people outside of the peak and that allows them to get more medicine. And that's roughly 20% reduction in death rates as I calculated. Which I was excited about and then last week I realized there's this 3 to 30 factor in death rate, which is a much bigger motivation.</p></blockquote><p><i>On natural viral load potentially being quite low</i></p><blockquote><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> One thing that I noticed when I was thinking about this carefully was that it's very important to understand what kinds of infections you would get in the wild. Like how many people low doses versus high doses versus giving everybody a low dose. Because you don't give everybody a high dose, no matter what policy you're in, unless you're doing something very malicious or on purpose.</p><p>So one rule of thumb I asked myself was, what's the household size in the United States as an example, right? Just to think about the American situation. The average American household is 2.6 people. If you exclude children that can easily be held home, who also just don't have much risk because children under the age of 18 basically never die or get seriously ill from this to a first approximation, we’re left with a household size that averages about two. 2.02 I believe is what I got.</p><p>So at that point, if we're worried about high viral loads being modelled as coming from familiar interactions inside whatever your lockdown, quarantine area would be. If someone else in it got it and then you got it from them, you're assuming you'd have probably a high viral load. And then if you get interactions at the grocery store or otherwise, trying to make your way in the world normally under a quarantine, you would then probably get a relatively low viral load. Right? Like the study with the measles with the kid who got it outside the home was relatively safe.</p></blockquote><p><i>On avoiding thinking about failure</i></p><blockquote><p><strong>Robin:</strong> But I actually agree with Ben that in many, even rationalists’ minds, they have hope. And this in some sense feels like giving up on the hope, that is once you just try to infect many people, then you're giving up on the vaccine that will save us all or the squash that will kill it all. And they put a substantial hope on those things. And this feels like giving up.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Yes. And you're not allowed to give up. Like that's really terrible to give up on human lives.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Or to make a plan B in case you fail is even really terrible.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Yeah. Making a plan B is already like escapism and pretty terrible but certainly actually doing it before we're sure we didn't have a way...</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Not only making a plan B but exploring and putting resources into figuring out which plan B would be better.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Well because like you're stealing, I can just imagine-</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Stealing resources of plan A.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Right. Like people are dying because you didn't give them tests. Like how dare you sir. You could have built a hospital instead of building this research clinic.</p></blockquote><p><i>On the coronavirus and existential risk</i></p><blockquote><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> I think this is more of an x-risk or approaching x-risk, than you're giving it credit for. In the sense that for example, this could lead to a US–China war, which could be very, very bad. This could lead to lasting severe economic damage, which would be very, very bad. Potentially even collapse of civil order under some scenarios. And if we don't get immunity for very long, this could be an actual civilizational threat. If this comes every year and is this bad because we can't shut down the economy like this every year, and it's not clear that we can sustain ourselves. So there are risks.</p></blockquote><p><i>On governance changing due to the virus</i></p><blockquote><p><strong>Robin:</strong> So, I wanted to mention that in most other areas of altruistic concerns, one of the big issues that come back again and again it's governance. People have various ways they hope the world can be improved, then they face governance limits. The governance gets in the way. Governance isn't there to solve the problem.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> We will be changing governance in response to this crisis. We already are changing governance in response to the crisis. How governance changes in response to this crisis will be crucial in terms of whether it opens it up or shuts down ways that we could coordinate on other important questions.</p></blockquote><p><i>On doing the basics first</i></p><blockquote><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Yeah, I think basically we are failing really hard on a lot of very simple things right now that we could push on that would greatly improve our chances of successfully squashing this, at least for a while. And that only after we've done those things and ramped up, so a few months from now, we should absolutely look at our data from deliberate infection tests and look at where we are and how likely we are to be able to contain this in the long run and economic costs of that and ask ourselves, should we be deliberately infecting now?</p></blockquote><p><i>On the most likely future</i></p><blockquote><p><strong>Robin:</strong> The scenario that I find most likely and disturbing is that all the hope that's generated lately for a lot more testing and a lot more tracing and a lot more isolation, the same government agencies are going to be implementing that, that already implemented the failure before, and they just won't pull it off. And that'll consistently happen all through the West and therefore this will just get really big. And then it'll go back and re-infect even China and Korea, et cetera, who had been keeping it out until a much larger way of comebacks comes back to hit them. And then there'll be this vast amount of death and all this finger pointing and all these recriminations and all this blaming. And that's a pretty bad scenario, but it seems to me the most likely one. I'm happy to support, hope and to help the hopeful scenarios try to develop, but I still can't put a huge probability on them.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> I think the reason I'm more hopeful than you are is because I don't see this as primarily resting upon the government being competent because I think that the people and the corporations and the non-governmental resources will pull this together and get us through this in a lot of scenarios, despite the government, right? Through the government's resistance. That's kind of a lot of what's happening already.</p></blockquote><p><i>Next steps for testing deliberate infection</i></p><blockquote><p><strong>Robin:</strong> We're talking right now about whether to focus on doing this. So we're asking, this relative to other things we could focus on, its relevant potential and priority and what we could be doing. So, I want to make the argument that even if you're not ready to pull the trigger, and I'm not clear that you shouldn't pull the trigger, we'll talk about that in a moment, that there's a lot to do here with high leverage that somebody, a foundation or philanthropists or whatever, could go a long way and do a lot to help with this just by first investigating legal permission and finding a way that somebody somehow could do it legally. And then finding a way to set up a place, even offshore, where you go do it for a small group so that we get the sort of data and the demonstration.</p></blockquote><h1>Links to Things Discussed in the Debate</h1><ul><li>Robin's blogposts on the policy, leading up to the debate<ul><li><a href=""http://www.overcomingbias.com/2020/02/consider-controlled-infection.html"">Consider Controlled Infection</a></li><li><a href=""http://www.overcomingbias.com/2020/02/deliberate-exposure-intuition.html"">Deliberate Exposure Intuition</a></li><li><a href=""http://www.overcomingbias.com/2020/03/simple-sims-on-pandemic-variance.html"">Simple Sims on Pandemic Variance</a></li><li><a href=""http://www.overcomingbias.com/2020/03/for-fast-escaped-pandemic-max-infection-date-variance-not-average.html"">For Fast Escaped Pandemic</a></li><li><a href=""http://www.overcomingbias.com/2020/03/for-fast-escaped-pandemic-max-infection-date-variance-not-average.html"">Max Infection Date <i>Variance</i>, Not <i>Average</i></a></li><li><a href=""http://www.overcomingbias.com/2020/03/expose-the-young.html"">Expose The Young</a></li><li><a href=""http://www.overcomingbias.com/2020/03/do-you-feel-lucky-punk.html"">Do You Feel Lucky, Punk?</a></li><li><a href=""http://www.overcomingbias.com/2020/03/know-when-to-fold-em.html"">Know When To Fold `Em</a>,</li></ul></li><li><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/coronavirus-link-database"">LessWrong's Coronavirus Link Database</a></li><li><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/j3m36wSTiDkDFioD7/lw-team-updates-pandemic-edition-march-2020"">Other work the LW team is doing on the virus</a></li><li>Zvi's <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/kNANcHLNtJt5qeuSS"">Immoral Mazes sequence</a></li><li><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85ZWxk5khyM"">Robin debates space exploration with chief strategist of Deep Space Industries</a></li><li>Zvi's <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/04/22/against-facebook/"">Against Facebook</a> posts</li><li><a href=""http://www.overcomingbias.com/2020/03/know-when-to-fold-em.html"">Blogpost by Robin that discusses 3 papers showing the effect size of reduced viral load</a></li><li>OpenPhil's <a href=""https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/forecasting-covid-19-pandemic"">Forecasting the COVID-19 Pandemic</a></li><li>Zvi’s review of <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/fLPcQ5oqJ8oFxRwwL/the-case-against-education"">The Case Against Education</a></li><li><a href=""https://www.google.com/search?source=hp&amp;ei=9-aMXqvOOYPF-gT5yKWoDg&amp;q=INDEXCBOE%3A+VIX&amp;oq=INDEXCBOE%3A+VIX&amp;gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzIFCAAQgwEyAggAMgIIADICCAA6DggAEOoCELQCEJoBEOUCSg0IFxIJMjM3ZzEwLTc3SgoIGBIGMWcxMC0xUNotWNotYMMyaAFwAHgAgAHiAYgBqwKSAQUxLjAuMZgBAKABAqABAaoBB2d3cy13aXqwAQY&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjrpbP6l9foAhWDop4KHXlkCeUQ4dUDCAk&amp;uact=5"">Volatility Index Graph</a></li><li><a href=""https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=438740"">Lotus Cobra MtG playing card</a></li><li>LW announcement: <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xB9A7xymXY4xAqeMT/hanson-vs-mowshowitz-livestream-debate-should-we-expose-the"">Hanson vs Mowshowitz LiveStream Debate: ""Should we expose the youth to coronavirus?""

Cool.</p><p><strong>Ben:</strong> Thank you very much Robin, thank you very much Zvi. Welcome to everyone who's joining, thanks for joining us. So this is the first LessWrong debate, and I've wanted to have a debate like this for a while. In particular, I've been interested in having Robin and Zvi have a debate, ever since I saw them writing various disagreements to each other on the internet on topics like blackmail. Robin's blog, Overcoming Bias, I've been reading for about 10 years, since I was like 13, so I've learned a bunch from that. And also I've seen Robin in various debates, and I can't think of a comparable reference class for a bullet of Econ 101 knowledge than when I've seen Robin do certain debates. There's a great debate Robin does with a guy who says we're going to colonize space soon, on YouTube, that I've occasionally watched with friends for fun.</p><p><strong>Ben:</strong> And then Zvi's blog I've been reading for a couple of years. And in terms of effects size, well I guess you got me to stop using Facebook, and I've definitely learned a lot from that in particular. Yeah, I have not used Facebook for about nine months. I haven't posted and I haven't used a react, except for making the Facebook event for this debate. So, you should question the incentives you're putting on me.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Throwing it all the way just for this!</p><p><strong>Ben:</strong> I think a lot of people in the current world don't have many opinions and they're sort of scared for them to think for themselves in public, but wherever I see Robin's and Zvi writing, they're always very much themselves and very much having strong opinions. We were originally going to take this debate on a different topic, but in the current crisis it seemed like it was something Robin's been writing about for over a month now, about his particular policy proposal. And Zvi had a lot of opinions and it seemed like a good topic to discuss.</p><p><strong>Ben:</strong> So I thought I'd be interested, just initially, to ask you guys how you're currently dealing with the current crisis and how much it's affecting you. I'm curious, Robin, how have the last couple of weeks been for you?</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Well, we moved into this condo two years ago, so as a professor I'm still working, I'm just working from home, teaching classes over the internet here. I had a little more warning than most, so managed to stock up, so I'm relatively comfortable. We're mostly anxious about my mother who seems to want to go to church every two days and hang out with people and can't be talked out of that. And we have lots of food that isn't as tasty as the food we could get if we went and got fresh ingredients, and we have to decide whether to be tempted to go out and get fresh ingredients or make sure to stay home, and whether we should not let the maid come and let it get dirty or that sort of thing. But otherwise we're doing pretty well.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Yeah, it's amazing the different orders of magnitude of risks that you're debating, and we have the same thing where Laura's and my parents we're very worried about this whole time. I was trying to convince my parents to leave New York City and they briefly went to Riverdale and then they decided to come back, and literally we'll just never go outside of the apartment. We'll have our friends bring us packages and we'll leave them outside for three days and it'll be fine, or something like that.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> But I still worry a lot. But no, it's been a very hectic two weeks for me and my family because we have two young children. Alexander is five and Gideon is two. And so we normally have a two bedroom apartment in Manhattan, and we very quickly dawned on us that being stuck there, even with a lot of food in the pantry, was going to rapidly drive everybody involved crazy. The nanny would have to either be with us or not be with us and both options seemed terrible, and we wouldn't be able to get any work done and it would be a complete disaster.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> And then the doubling time turned out to be two and a half days instead of what I thought it was, which was four or five. So I thought I had an extra week or two to do things that I thought I was safe and then I wasn't, just like everybody else. So we went down to see houses here in Warwick, New York, and then we decided to stay an extra day and actually just rent one immediately. So we managed to close a day after we started looking at places, signed a lease, got out of our old lease, all of our stuff was shipped here. We went back to New York, actually, three times because our awful, awful Mayor started talking about potential lockdowns and quarantines. And the last thing you do, right before a lockdown, is say you might have a lockdown. You idiot.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> So instead we went in the car and got a friend to bring another car and we just took all of the stuff, Passover style, we just couldn't live without, and we just ran away with two cars and some stuff. Then we came back with a van the next day and got the stuff that we really didn't want to live without. And then we got movers for the furniture, which we did in two parts because I didn't want to be in New York three days later to let the house be ready, among other reasons. Because the infection rate was doubling every three days and it seemed really like a bad idea. And on top of all of this, at the same time, we get news that my son's special education teacher is sick and she's getting a test and she's positive.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> So we get a test for our son, who is five, who of course is asymptomatic because he's five, and it's inconclusive because he wouldn't cooperate with the swab, we apparently couldn't get enough material. And so then we have to go back and get tests for us because we now had long enough to do that. And luckily we figured out how to do that and we got tests and we're both negative.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> What's weird is that like, this is actually relevant to our discussion, we were hoping it would be positive. Because by that time Laura had minor symptoms and they had gone away and I had not had any symptoms for a while. I'd be like, ""Well, if we're both positive now then we're just immune. Isn't that just better? Like yeah, we suffered a bit but what's done is done and we got through it before the hospital system got overwhelmed and it wasn't our choice but great.""</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> But alas, we now still have to debate exactly how we're going to de-sanitize our packages and our takeout and so on, and try to get delivery slots for the groceries. But we're settling in now to rural house life and it's very different in many ways where you can't go anywhere. But it has advantages, and I think life is mostly returning to normal at this point and that allows me to then, of course, spend a lot of my time obsessing over the situation of Covid-19. Which is not what I was hoping for, I was hoping to get back to work, but we'll make do. So, here we are.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> So that's my situation. I've also, my dad is an immunologist, so I've been trying to consult with him to get more information and apparently he was at least helpful in contacting Andrew Cuomo and getting him to do a convalescent serum antibody testing.</p><p><strong>Ben:</strong> Nice. Nice. I'm glad to hear that.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> I'm happy we've at least done something.</p><p><strong>Ben:</strong> Yeah. So yeah, just my update, we've been quarantining for a couple of weeks now and I was successful in getting my mum to isolate and stockpile a couple weeks early, which was pretty good. We had one person renting in our house and they still had been renting for a while and been looking for a place. We managed to help them get rent on a place for a month and they moved out the day before the lockdown and they were someone who had kept going into work and using public transport. So we're lucky to finally have the place to ourselves and just people who are down for isolating and so on. But yeah, otherwise we've been working on it pretty non-stop at LessWrong. We’ve been trying to summarize a bunch of the advice online and build some databases and doing a bunch of stuff. It's been a full time focus of the team now. Just late nights and so on.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Yeah, it's weird getting half of my world-news from rationalists over the last month, between LessWrong and rationalist Twitter it seems like a lot of the best information is coming forward.</p><p><strong>Ben:</strong> I feel like I learned a lot from Robin cause I think Robin tweeted… you were writing about this early February, mid-February?</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Mid-February.</p><p><strong>Ben:</strong> And then like a week later you were like ""Ah, this has become normal now. This is time for me to leave the conversation because I have done all that I can do."" I it like ""Oh wow, you're trying to be that ahead of the curve?” Okay, that makes sense why you're not getting...</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> It didn't really work, I'm afraid. I want to make clear to everyone, we don't think we are suffering, especially compared to other people and especially what's going to be happening over the next few months. So we just thought it would be good to relate everyone our personal stories just so you could–</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Yeah. Look, we had a freak out set of two weeks that were very, very stressful and we were briefly worried that maybe Laura's parents were positive, and any number of things could happen. But yeah, it's nothing compared to people who are actually sick or actually on the front lines of this thing. Like we have enough spare cash to just go rent a place and move there and work from home and hide out. So yes, we're going to be fine and other people might not be. It would be, obviously if our parents got sick that would be very bad and very sad. That's the only thing that we're personally worried about. That and our stock portfolios, I guess to the extent that we still have them.</p><h1>Debate First Half</h1><h2>Basic Case for Deliberate Infection</h2><p><strong>Ben:</strong> So moving onto the topic of discussion, which is the policy proposal from Robin. Robin, do you want to just take five 10 minutes and just like outline your position?</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> I will try to briefly summarize, and Zvi feel free to butt-in. So I don't know if you've told them, but we've decided to do a relatively flexible debate format where we'll just interrupt each other and go back and forth. And if the moderators decide, somewhere along the way, that one of us has been talking a lot more than the other, they might intervene. But probably that won't happen. So we're just going to talk.</p><p><strong>Ben:</strong> Great. Go for it.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> All right. And you guys have some links, probably up, with some of my blog posts presumably. All right, so the basic idea here is to have a better Plan B. Lots of people in the last month had been really hopeful that even though we really screwed up in the first month or two of this, especially in the United States compared to many other places in the world, that we're the dynamic powerhouse and we're going to fix that and we're going to, therefore, create unprecedented levels of testing and tracing and isolation and we're just going to do a heroic job. And hey, it's our moonshot, it's our World War II and this generation is going to do it.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> And you know what? That's a hope, it's real and it should be pursued. But we should also be planning for what happens if that doesn't work. Because you know, up until a few weeks ago at least, most experts in this area, most public health people were saying it's over. It got out, at this point was where we usually give up. So what if we can't contain this thing? What if it basically spreads to most everyone? And so most everyone gets sick and therefore, even if the estimates of half a percent of the population who are infected die, and half the world is infected, you're still talking 20 million people in the world dying. So what could we do about that?</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> So the usual story is flatten the curve, try to lower the infection rate so that even though just as many people eventually get infected, they're spread out more over time so that they each have more medical resources available to them. That's the usual story. And it's a fine story and we should be willing to pay substantial, though not infinite, costs to spread out the curve. And that's why we are doing a lot of lockdown sorts of things.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> But that policy has some, perhaps, neglected costs. So obviously there's a huge economic cost and social cost just from messing up the whole system. And then a lot of people will be depressed and commit suicide and not could access to medicine, et cetera. But in addition, there's this key effect of dose size in infections. So when you are home, locked down, you're much more likely to get infected in the home or get infected from some close contact you have. And those sorts of infections would tend to come up with a lot of copies of the virus in the first, if you kissed somebody, for example, in the first bunch. And at that point, it's a race in your body between the immune system, which is trying to grow up fast, and then the viruses which are trying to grow fast.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> And the bigger that initial load, the harder it is for your system to beat it. And in the three other data points that I've been able to find clearly for death in humans, this death rate as a function of this dose varies from a factor of 3 to 30. So we're talking a really large factor here. For example, people are really obsessed with ventilators. Like do we have enough ventilators, et cetera. I'm going apparently 85% of people who get a ventilator die anyway, so ventilators can, at most, say 15% of them.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> So a factor of 3 to 30, it's just bigger than that. So that makes you worry a bit about the lockdowns, although if you are going to be able to suppress it and then only a small fraction of people ever got it, that that factor of 3 to 30 could still be worth it. But if we're actually going to go everywhere, it's not clear it's worth paying that factor of 3 or 30, but that raises another exciting prospect which is, we could go the other direction. Instead of accepting an average infection rate that you'd get if everybody was just mixing, which is lower than if you lock everybody down and make sure they have high contact doses, what if we go out of our way to do low doses and deliberately infect people with low doses.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> And you know this has historical precedent. This is basically the treatment used for smallpox up until the vaccine in the late 1700s. And reportedly, for back then, it was the difference between a 20% or 30% mortality rate if you got infected naturally, and 1% or 2% rate if you got infected through the low dose. So, we could start a policy of infecting people on purpose and then immediately isolating. Now if you just go infect people on purpose but you don't isolate them, you just speed up the whole thing and you make the flatten the curve thing worse. You're sharpening the curve. But since you're deliberately infecting somebody, you can go out of your way to make sure that they're isolated right at that point. And so the idea here would then be to deliberately infect people.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Now of course, you could imagine a mandatory program and telling who to get infected and people could be really upset. I would more imagine a voluntary program where the first thing to do is just make sure there is a place you're allowed to do it and a place you could go if you wanted to do it, where maybe you'd have to pay to go but it's like a hotel or something where there's some medical services there if you turn out to need it. But otherwise you're in your hotel room and you're infected.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> And in order to make that happen, we just need legal permission which is some work because it's not clear that you'd have legal permission here. But if you could just have some group of people that have legal permission to do this, then you can set that up. And then the first few groups that did this, they would try to learn exactly what the right way was to give you a low dose and whether it should be a prick on your skin or through your mouth or whatever, what should it be as a way to get to you. And we would figure out exactly how far we could go in terms of lowering mortality rates.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> And then, of course, once it was successfully demonstrated, then you might consider a larger policy, which mainly I would think would be able to form subsidizing, i.e. paying people to volunteer to do this so you get more of them. And preferentially paying some groups over others. Obviously young people and healthy people are going to face a lower death risk if they do this, but they will contribute roughly the same amount to lowering the overall degree of infection in society and getting to the point of, what they call, herd immunity. So it would make more sense to infect the young and healthy. Also make more sense to infect critical workers who you would need at key times.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> And so that's basically the idea. And surprisingly, given how we have this huge historical precedent of smallpox, there's been very little discussion of this. I should also mention, I initially, six weeks ago, started writing about this in the context of flattening the curve just from the benefit of if you deliberately infect and isolate people, then you infect some people outside of the peak and that allows them to get more medicine. And that's roughly 20% reduction in death rates as I calculated. Which I was excited about and then last week I realized there's this 3 to 30 factor in death rate, which is a much bigger motivation. And so that's my basic case. Of course, we can go farther into the discussion, and Zvi knows this, but the rest of you may not have so.</p><h2>Critiques on effect size and timing</h2><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Right. So just going to outline. I do think that this effect is almost certainly real. We have low confidence in its size obviously, the effective of low viral versus high viral loads initially. But it's almost certainly real. And I do think that the initial proposal of Robin's to deliberately infect people, to get it outside of the top of the curve, that proposal has expired just because we are already too late. By the time we ramped up deliberate infections, we wouldn't be able to flatten the curve that way anyway.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Maybe in New York City. There's a whole rest of the world that is not anywhere near their peak yet.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong>I think they're a few weeks behind at most in most places. But certainly in New York, the peak is here right now. But my understanding is that right now we're a few weeks away from peak, hospital systems are going to be overwhelmed in most places unless we had extraordinary success with the social distancing.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> But if it was a factor of 10, you might still be tempted to use it even at the peak. If it was really a factor of 10 reduction death rate.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> If you were confident it was a factor of 10 versus what you would get otherwise. So one thing that I noticed when I was thinking about this carefully was that it's very important to understand what kinds of infections you would get in the wild. Like how many people low doses versus high doses versus giving everybody a low dose. Because you don't give everybody a high dose, no matter what policy you're in, unless you're doing something very malicious or on purpose.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> So one rule of thumb I asked myself was, what's the household size in the United States as an example, right? Just to think about the American situation. The average American household is 2.6 people. If you exclude children that can easily be held home, who also just don't have much risk because children under the age of 18 basically never die or get seriously ill from this to a first approximation, we’re left with a household size that averages about two. 2.02 I believe is what I got.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> So at that point, if we're worried about high viral loads being modelled as coming from familiar interactions inside whatever your lockdown, quarantine area would be. If someone else in it got it and then you got it from them, you're assuming you'd have probably a high viral load. And then if you get interactions at the grocery store or otherwise, trying to make your way in the world normally under a quarantine, you would then probably get a relatively low viral load. Right? Like the study with the measles with the kid who got it outside the home was relatively safe, right?</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Sure. But I've only been able to find these three data points so far. Maybe there are more, and I wish somebody would go look for them. These three data points are about ‘in-the-wild’ infections and there are differences there. So the smallpox example is in-the-wild infections across a wide range of degrees of contact, was producing 20% to 30% mortality and then the deliberate ‘variolation’ they call it, was one to 2%. Yeah.</p><p><strong>Ben:</strong> Can I just, as Zvi joins, to take a minute or two to outline all the main points of your disagreement, as well as this one.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Please.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Yeah, in just a minute, but basically my opinion is that we are currently not in a position, I think Robin would largely agree, to just do this on a massive scale. We have an idea of “What if we did this?”, but we have neither the permission nor the logistical capabilities nor the understanding of how to safely give people reliable low dose. Nor do we have the extra tests to verify that they actually got infected, because if we do it right most of them will be asymptomatic and then we would have to hold them until we reliably thought they were immune. And then to have this work, they would have to be confident they were immune, which probably means getting antibody tests for them, which we also don't have. And all of this on top of having actively malicious FDA and CDC and WHO people trying to stop even ordinary mitigation and reasonable effects, let alone something like this.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> So I don't think that this is particularly actionable right now. Plus the problem of with a lot of low doses already, we're just not going to get, 3 to 30 is a misleading win. We're talking more like 1.5 to 10. And then you have to consider the fact that not having hospitals available to save you which, if we did this at scale, would just be true if we did over the next month or two in most places, would mean a factor that wasn't that much lower than that working against you.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> So I just don't think this is a practical thing to do right now because we just can't spare the resources in various ways to do it properly and we don't know how to do it. But I do think that we should absolutely run this and many other experiments that involve infecting people on purpose, or accepting that a lot of people who experiment on will be infected, in order to learn much more about the virus in various ways. And I think we'll probably have broad agreement about those policies when we discuss them.</p><p><strong>Ben:</strong> I think the UK maybe had an experiment for some period where you'd get paid money, you could take the virus and they would do certain tests on you to try and test some of these variables.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Yeah, I saw a little bit of that. I haven't seen any results. Do you know if there was any results?</p><p><strong>Ben:</strong> I have also not seen any results from that.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> I think people were paid to pick a different but similar coronavirus, so people weren't actually paid to take this coronavirus.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Yeah. I believe that that was not the most helpful thing for us to do right now. I mean it might be better than nothing, but it didn't teach us the information we want to know. Like we could learn so much from so few infections, most of which would almost certainly end up being low dose in healthy people, and we're just not doing it and–</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> But the latest Nature issue has an article about, what they called, human challenge: what are the ethics of actually allowing people to be directly infected with the virus rather than infecting the whole population to get faster vaccine data. And they were not so sure it was ethical.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Right. Which obviously makes both of our heads explode. But the word biological ethics, medical ethics, is almost an oxymoron when used in the wild. Just the things that they think about just don't make sense from the perspective of what happens to people in many cases. At least that's my perspective and I think it's probably–</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> That subject could take us the entire time if we–</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Yeah. I didn't mean to get off on a rant here, as they say.</p><p><strong>Ben:</strong> And then my model is you're also under the impression there are a bunch of other low hanging fruits that should be a primary next steps as opposed to exposing the youth?</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Yeah, I think basically we are failing really hard on a lot of very simple things right now that we could push on that would greatly improve our chances of successfully squashing this, at least for a while. And that only after we've done those things and ramped up, so a few months from now, we should absolutely look at our data from deliberate infection tests and look at where we are and how likely we are to be able to contain this in the long run and economic costs of that and ask ourselves, should we be deliberately infecting now?</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> And it's not obvious to me we should start with the young also. A lot of my intuitions say we should actually start with the old, because if we're accepting that everyone's going to get infected, the primary win comes from the infection being mild and therefore you want to save someone's life, you do it in an old person. A person who's 23 gets a mild infection, doesn't save that much life cause they were probably fine anyway. A person is 87–</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> So I did an initial analysis in a spreadsheet simulation and in that thing it turned out infecting the young was better. But of course, a more complicated model, including more things might have a different effect.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> I agree.</p><h2>Response to critique on effect size</h2><p><strong>Robin:</strong> So it sounds like your main objection is that it can't be done now and or that it would have less effects that I'm claiming. So that second thing seems like easier to start with, but my-</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Yeah, we were getting into it and then we decided to outline things.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Well sure. But from my point of view, I just say we have limited data, but all the data we've seen has tended to see pretty large effects of initial dose and what they call a viral load. That is, there's a very strong correlation between viral load and symptoms and a great many viruses. And so there are these three data points I could find and they are a factor of 3 to 30. And if you're saying 1.5 to 10, [I assume you’re] just trying to say there must be a selection effect there so that I'm going to discount it on the basis of if people saw a smaller effect, maybe they didn't publish it or something. Is that-</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Well, no. Let's be very concrete about the example. I remember two of them very distinctly. The third one was the actual coronavirus. So there's that one, so my opinion-</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> No. One was smallpox, one was measles, one was SARS.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Oh SARS. I forget what the details of the SARS one were. So the years of the measles one, I believe, was at a 14 to 1 difference between the first person to get infected in a home and everybody else?</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Yep.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> And what I was saying was, you have to discount that by a factor of two because half of people will get it outside the home anyway.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Not clear.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Well, I mean just because of household size. Like American, if you discount children, just the average household has two people-</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> But if we're all locked down then-</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> You think we increased household size substantially?</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> I mean it's about close contacts. I mean a lot of people aren't going to be all by themselves, they're going to make visits once in a while to see a close friend or family. And those are the times when they also might get it close.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Well, it's not obvious to me that visiting a friend is the same level of high dose as living with someone. I don't know. Obviously that's not the way it was done before. Certainly there's some possibility of that, but it's also possible that a lot of interactions will be less intense than they would have been otherwise if people were taking a lot of precautions. Like certainly a lot of places that people–</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Okay. If we take a factor of 14 and divide it by 2 and get a factor of 7, I mean that's still huge, right?</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> It's still huge, but the issue being that if we have a factor of five from the hospital not being available, those two almost cancel out.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Do we in fact have a factor of five for a hospital not being available? I mean that's less clear to me. This seems to me the biggest factor I can think of. What other factors are a thing?</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> We don't know the number for sure. I know it was a factor of at least several. So smallpox was a difference between a deliberate minimal infection and the infections from the wild. Not just between a low dose, but like a deliberate low dose. And I strongly agree that if we can get to a super low dose through experiments that reduce our findings even below current low doses by a factor of this kind of level, then we should strongly consider doing it. The other question is do we think to a first extent everyone's going to get infected or not, obviously. But–</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Right. I started out my presentation with that is the plan B sort of thing. We need–</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Right. We both agree that this is a plan B. We shouldn't just jump to it if we don't have to.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> But we should go as far along to the path as needed so that we would be ready to invoke plan B. If we're not even ready to invoke it then we need to make sure that we get it ready to invoke.</p><h2>Agreement: In praise of experiments</h2><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Right. So I think the points that we violently agree is that you–</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> I'm saying if, for example, we allowed 10,000 people to be deliberately infected and then allowing people to vary the dose and delivery size, that thing, that would probably be plenty enough to learn about how to get a low dose and the right method, you would think. And 10,000 people is a pretty small number here in comparison to the size of the problem.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> But from the perspective of “if we didn't have people literally standing in our way with guns”, we should absolutely do this. We kind of do, right? We have people who are telling us we can't. This is very much not considered an appropriate thing to do and anybody who tried to do this in any kind of controlled setting, in any kind of public way, is gonna have problems.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Well, so I think in some sense, civil disobedience should be left on the table as an option. Not yet.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> If it would work.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> But we should try to do this legally. We should try to do this with permission. But if we're talking these large factors of gain, at some point you might want to allow, or even encourage, people to do things that aren't permitted.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Yeah, I think that if we can run the experiment such that we will actually get the data we want, not just haphazardly infect people, but like infect people carefully, collect the data, do the testing. Of course, we still have to get the resources necessary to gather the data, which would have to come from somewhere. But my understanding is at least some amount of testing is just not being allowed by the FDA. Like there's capacity to produce a lot more tests than we are and we're just not being allowed to do so because they weren't sufficiently accurate or whatnot. And we could potentially use those.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Although there could be a difference in permission in some university or lab trying officially to do a test, and a bunch of us just infecting ourselves but then collecting the data together.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> That would be the hope. But basically this is one of many experiments we are not doing, right? Like one–</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> We're talking right now about whether to focus on doing this. So we're asking, this relative to other things we could focus on, its relevant potential and priority and what we could be doing. So, I want to make the argument that even if you're not ready to pull the trigger, and I'm not clear that you shouldn't pull the trigger, we'll talk about that in a moment, that there's a lot to do here with high leverage that somebody, a foundation or philanthropists or whatever, could go a long way and do a lot to help with this just by first investigating legal permission and finding a way that somebody somehow could do it legally. And then finding a way to set up a place, even offshore, where you go do it for a small group so that we get the sort of data and the demonstration.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Cause I think, if you could even do it at the small scale and then publicize the results, that could go a long way toward enticing a lot of other people to consider it. So the limiting factor is that first demonstration.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Right. I didn't mean that we shouldn't do it because we have so many other experiments we should run first or anything. We should run all of them, right. They don't preclude each other in any way. One of the few studies we have was a reasonably terrible, in many ways, study of 30 people in France, and that caused medications that people need to be just sold out everywhere, almost immediately, because it looked promising. So that's how much we... That's how desperate we are for data, right. Whether or not it ends up working.</p><h2>Response to critique on timing</h2><p><strong>Robin:</strong> So there's this other point you made about it's too late. And so let's go through different scenarios and ask in which scenarios are [we] too late. So one scenario would be the current doubling every three days just considers until the entire United States population is done, and well, I guess, at that point, we're talking another four weeks, right.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> It depends on exactly where you think we are right now. My best guess is we're at several million. We're at 1% infected at this point in the US, so one, two, three, four, five, six. Yeah, we've seven doublings left then everyone's infected, so that's seven times two-and-a-half. Yeah, over two weeks.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Right, so that's one case. So in the case that basically most everyone gets infected within a month, it's very hard to do much of anything, of course, in terms of policy. And then you would have to face the question of do you want to try deliberate infection near the peak under the hope that it has a lower rate, on the basis of data that isn't as direct as you'd like, but it's still relevant data, then you'd have to be making a gamble. And so, even for those people, if we could just get data in the next few weeks that helped pin down – even just doing better literature review to find other historical cases. I mean that's a really cheap low bar.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> I mean, obviously we should do a literature review, right. If there are people who are just sitting around at home doing ordinary academic stuff, and you hire them to do a literature review – some billionaire should hire them to do a literature review. That's a slam dunk. I don't see how you could possibly disagree.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Right. But another scenario is the lockdown works temporarily. It doesn't squash it and make it disappear in a month, but it holds the line, or holds the line in some places, grows in other places, declines in other places. And now you're looking at a many month, perhaps even year long scenario of alternate intermittent lockdowns. And in that scenario, it seems like there's plenty of opportunity for deliberate infection, as a policy, even four months from now, to show up and have a big effect.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Yes. So when I say it's too late, I meant it's too late to do it sort of to lessen the initial peak, right. The initial peak is going to happen, whatever it is, without any chance of–</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> If the initial peak is as fast as we fear. If we successfully lockdown enough to spread out the peaks substantially.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Right. I mean I think the scenario where it ends up being sensible to deliberately infect people is in fact that scenario where we are able to somewhat contain it, buy yourself some time, ramp up our available resources, but it's not good enough to squash, right. And it becomes clear that we can't, right.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> So, I mean, I'd say... Well, among the things we could do in the next month, while we're trying to squash, getting ready to have this available, should we partially squash, successfully seems a pretty high priority, the only other things would be is what would it take to actually make us successfully squash, but I mean most of us can't personally work on testing, and the government is supposedly going to set up a big agency to do tracing, and I'm very afraid that they will just be incompetent at that and make a bad job of it. But if we could help with that, that would help under that scenario. Because basically to do this successful squashing we'll have to not only lock people down long enough, we're going to have to set up a regime of very high levels of testing and very high levels of tracing, which probably includes a fairly high level of privacy invasion.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> My understanding is one of these things where you have a variety of things you can do. You sort of start with this R0 of around 4, which varies a little bit by place, and then you can engage in a variety of different actions to reduce that to help you stop the spread. You successfully go well below one, you win, you squash, as long as you keep it below one, you get to keep squashing. One of the things you can do is test a lot. One of the things you can do is do more aggressive tracing on people you've tested and invade people's privacy. You can also do things like get people to wear masks, get people to continue to socially distance to some extent, take other proper hygiene precautions, et cetera. You can also do deliberate infections, obviously. One of the things it does is it helps with that.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Right, but I'm asking specifically, well what would you put up against this research program as something that you think is something people who are listening could get involved with and do something with in the next few weeks.</p><h2>Robin asks for an alternative concrete proposal</h2><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Right. So personally what I have been involved with is actually trying somewhat to increase capacity/push the government towards taking better actions to increase testing capacity and actions towards treatment. And that has had some success because I happen to have some channels, but that's not–</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> So we're talking testing capacity or other medical capacities?</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> We actually set up a lab to do tests and actually got people running tests that wouldn't otherwise have been run. So we did in fact ramp up our testing capacity somewhat. And then the FDA said you can't run that test. That is, of course, how it works. We also managed to get Cuomo to pursue antibody testing and convalescence here, but that's obviously uniquely good success. So a number of people in our circles have been pursuing messaging, trying to get the word out about various low hanging fruit that people could pick in the hopes that people would pick them. We also obviously could try to get word to people with resources to try and pick some of that fruit themselves. There are a lot of people listening, I think, including Ben, who have primary or secondary context of people with a lot of resources.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> So I'm hearing a lot of meta things, but I'm less hearing specifics. But first you just make some tests. You say okay, you could be making... So lots of people are out there trying to make more tests right now. There's a world full of people trying to make more tests, and obviously, as you say, regulation is more the barrier.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Well I mean I strongly agree. If it is feasible to run experiments on COVID-19 to find out more about how COVID-19 works, what leads to better or worse infections, what leads to what infection rate on what actions, so people can know what to do. That will almost certainly involve a deliberate infection incidentally, even if that wasn't the intended purpose. I do think that is all very high priority. I think that finding out information through experimentation seems to be by far the most efficient local thing that anyone can do.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Okay, again I'm saying, you're drifting into abstraction, and so I'm trying to pull you down to concrete. So, messaging and networking and experimenting, which is all at the abstract level, but this proposal of mine is relatively concrete. Yes. These meta things do help add leverage, but it's about a thing you can concretely imagine them. And I think one of the advantages is that, instead of just trying to encourage the government to do better, which is this amorphous thing where you're trying to pull all these levers and there's all these intermediate variables you can't see and that matter a lot, this is a relatively simple, straightforward thing to implement. If you say deliberate infection means you have a place, they show up, you infect them, you keep them there until their symptoms are subsided, or two weeks plus later, and then you let them go. And so it seems to be harder to mess up as a method.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> And it's obvious that even if you do a bad choice initially about exactly how to initially infect, or even where to have the location, you would quickly learn that people don't want to go to that place, they want to go somewhere else. They want you to have better curtains, or beds, or whatever else it is. You would learn in the process of doing that and you would get data on which methods are better, most effective. So part of the advantage I'm suggesting here is yes, you could message about it. Yes, you could network about it. Yes, you could do all these abstract things that you can do for anything, but here is a concrete, simple proposal that's hard to mess up.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Yeah. So in terms of concrete, simple things, I hear people just trying to physically get equipment to the right places and stuff where we certainly have much more leverage than people would think, because I've seen a number of–</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> So we're talking ventilators then?</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> I've seen ventilators, I've seen masks, I've seen, in my case, tests. Actually some physical tests. We've gotten people tested who needed to be tested, out of thin air. But yeah, I agree that there's a lot of people doing that. That's ramping up on a logarithmic scale on....</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Right. So in those categories, can you say how much effort is there and what percentage effect am I adding to efforts to get masks to people, or efforts to get tests to people? I mean you got to say you personally, or you, whoever's listening, is a small fraction of that, because a lot of people are...</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Yeah. It is a small fraction. I don't want to discourage people if they're considering doing those things, I think your leverage is better than you think it is.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Okay, but I'm talking about a thing that almost nobody's doing anything about, right.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> No, I'm going to get to that in a second.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> So your personal leverage is much higher on this, I would say.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Absolutely. So to get to that, so when I said experimentation, I was trying to be concrete. So you're proposing you're infecting people and then you see what happens to them as your primary thing. So if I was trying to just use what resources I had and was able to do things that might get people infected, I would be doing something that was trying to kill more birds with that stone. I would be saying let's study practical types of interactions that happen in real life but see what causes people to get infected, and what doesn't, at what rates, and then, once they're infected, let's not waste this opportunity to study what happens to them exactly afterwards based on those means.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> And then if we thought we had a way to introduce very, very small infections to them, and maybe get a good prognosis, and we had anybody run that experiment, then we should absolutely do that once we have the mechanical idea how to do that. I don't know how hard it is to try and get smallpox levels of exactly the right amount. My understanding is that it was an art form that was developed over a very long time exactly how much you needed to get the person to be infected at all and actually have an immune response, because if you do too little, nothing happens.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Sure, but with enough cases that would be an obvious parameter that you'd experiment with. I mean people wouldn't forget to get to look at that, of course. And within 10,000 cases, I'm pretty sure you'd get that parameter down.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> If you can get 10,000 cases. So the question then is do we have a reasonable path, right, to actually cause this to happen?</p><h2>Zvi asks for next actions to take</h2><p><strong>Robin:</strong> So moderator, I thought we were initially thinking about 45 minutes and then a break. Is this about when you were going to do the break?</p><p><strong>Ben:</strong> I was going to maybe head for another five minutes.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> I think we should keep going, given where we are in the conversation. But I'm very curious to hear how you think that we would do this.</p><p><strong>Ben:</strong> Yeah, I know. That seems solid. Yeah, let's go for at least another five minutes. And yeah, go ahead.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> So, I mean the fact about this proposal is that a lot of people hate it.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> So that's both an obstacle and an opportunity in that if you understand that you don't hate it, you understand that a lot of other people are put off from it, therefore your participation and effort could have much higher leverage. This is something that I mean I found five other people who have written on the idea in the last four weeks, who have posted something on it, and they're not doing that much with it. So there are things you personally could do which would have especially high leverage, just because almost nobody is working on this. Now obviously one of the things to do was to focus on how to present it and how to get it legally and culturally framed and engaged so that it has the best chance, but you also have a high leverage with respect to that because so many people initially react to this so badly that almost nobody wants to talk about it.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> There's a research institute that I have an association with, and they were calling for proposals, and they were handing out lots of money to people who wrote proposals. They want to do something. But they rejected mine without comment because I presume they said, ""No, we don't want to be associated with that."" That's the kind of thing that's going on all over the place, which means that if you are a sort of rationalist who says, ""No, but this makes sense,"" you are an unusual resource, and therefore your efforts could have unusually high leverage relative to masks, or ventilators, or tests, which lots of people get are a good idea, and for them it's just more a matter of how to do it. So that's my basic pitch is that, because the current effort is so small and the potential is so huge, you have a better shot if you are the sort of person who doesn't throw up when you hear this, of jumping in on this and trying to work with me or others and figure out a way to make it work. And then you asked me many questions about how would we do this, I don't know because there's almost none of us working on this. Come help. Come help figure out how to–</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> So the proposal is not to spend a large percentage of the nation's or world's, or efforts on this problem. The proposal is to use our specific resources to try and just make it happen on the side while no-one is looking, kind of.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> In the hope that, with a concrete enough demonstration and a big enough effect, you could then entice lots of other people to try it. I mean I think getting a large fraction of the population to do it isn't crazy, but it wouldn't happen on the basis of merely the evidence or arguments we have now, it would have to be mediated by concrete demonstrations. So then the question is how can we get those demonstrations going? And of course that's what happened with smallpox. Smallpox variolation, it was initially very controversial, and many people thought it was a terrible idea. Just the same sort of emotions that create anti-vaxxers, the horror at being infected with something that might be real was even more than, because this was in fact the real thing they were infected with.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> And imagine people in 1700, the sort of ordinary people back then and how they would react to these proposals, a lot of them really hated it. Nevertheless, it became adopted in that standard practice. And in part because elite intellectuals, including famous mathematician Bernoulli, went and did a lot of careful intellectual work to demonstrate that it not only empirically worked out well, but in abstract modeling and analysis it would be good overall for society.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Yeah, it was a very over-determinedly correct thing to do once they got–</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Which doesn't mean it actually happens in our world, unfortunately.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> And it still was very hard, but eventually a lot of people ended up doing it, although definitely not all, true. And right, so the question is is there a practical path for us to pursue? And so your answer is that just you haven't gotten that far. You wrote a grant and clearly they were the wrong people to ask.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> But I mean just more people thinking about this, even doing simple things as a literature review, doing some legal research to find legal scenario options, even just knowing what it would take to set up a facility like a hotel with medical facilities. Are there things like that? Could you use an existing elderly care facility for this purpose? There's just a bunch of things to just go do to try to figure out to see how we can make this work.</p><p><strong>Ben:</strong> If I could jump in there, this seems like a good time to take a 10-minute break. Hopefully when we'll come back, we'll chat a bit more concretely about how we expect it would actually go down, and how likely we expect it to fix into the various win conditions. See you guys then. Thanks.</p><p><i>[Editor’s note: Robin lists things to do in more detail in the end of the second half.]</i></p><h1>Debate Second Half</h1><h2>Brief recap on assorted topics</h2><p><strong>Ben:</strong> Welcome back.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ben:</strong> So I will just try and summarize what I understood both of you to be saying, and then we'll see where to go from there. Robin, I think you opened by saying two of the main things that seemed relevant to you were that infections in young people tend to be much less severe, on the road to herd immunity, and in general, this means that infecting them is going to have much less bad outcomes than infecting old people. And the other important part was that you realize this important point about the viral load hypothesis, that it seems quite plausible that ways that many people are getting infected is being infected with a very large viral load, perhaps in the house with someone they live with. And if you can infect people with a very small viral load, this tends to have much less severe outcomes. And so we could systematically make sure that everyone who gets it has a much less severe version of it. So then you started with that.</p><p><strong>Ben:</strong> And then I think Zvi came back with sort of three main points, which were that we're heading towards the peak sort of continuously, or to a major peak, and the last thing you want during the peak is to have more people infected, just when the hospitals are overrun, that's just going to be the worst time to have more people infected. I think the second point was that we already have a fairly limited medical capacity, and it is unclear that we actually have any slack at all to execute this sort of thing. And then the third point, which was discussed which is slightly meta, which was that people are currently coordinating around important low-hanging interventions, like more testing and using masks and so on, and that has currently not successfully been effected, and that's where he feels much more effort should be put.</p><p>[Note from the editor: I failed to mention the important discussion about the effect size. Oops.]</p><p><strong>Ben:</strong> And to which I think Robin replied talking about this is a sort of weird idea that if you're the sort of person who can deal with weird ideas, it is quite plausible, but actually your leverage here is just way higher compared to those other things that a lot of people in general seem to be able to get behind. That's my current summary. I'm curious, were there any key points that I missed or did I mischaracterize some of the things you guys said?</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> So just at the beginning, my initial point was just deliberate infection plus isolation allowed you to move some of the cases away from the peak. It was less about young versus old. Given that you're going to do it, it turned out in my analysis to be better to do the young, but the main point was that you could flatten the curve via deliberate infection, even if there were no dose effect. But then I recently realized the dose effect. Anyway, that was the one correction I'll make.</p><p><strong>Ben:</strong> I think so. Zvi, did that seem accurate?</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Yeah. And I respond to that with basically that we maybe could have done that if we had done it early and done it properly – as in the quarantine didn't break it all. But I find it hard to model, that by doing it before we hammer the current peak, it doesn't seem like it would be useful in that light.</p><p><strong>Ben:</strong> So your lesson was that… Sorry, I just want to finish something first. Sorry this is a dumb thing, but your lesson is we should've listened to Robin earlier when he wrote the blog posts.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Oh definitely, we should listen to Robin when he says something unique and new, and think about, because again, we're the people who are capable of thinking about such things. I like to think that when I say something, or many rationalists say something unique and weird, it's worth spending your time to think about it, even if most of the time you think oh, that's wrong, and go about your day.</p><p><strong>Ben:</strong> Sorry, I just wanted to add a few more things. So we will move to a Q&amp;A shortly, in maybe somewhere in the next 15 to 30 minutes. And if you want to have a question, the correct place to put that question is either in a comment section on LessWrong, on the event for this post, or to PM user Jacob Lagerros, his username is JacobJacob. And if he picks your question he'll send you a Zoom link and you can join in on this call and chat with us.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Okay, cool.</p><p><strong>Ben:</strong> Yeah, that's modern technology. It's alright.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> I thought we'd just be reading off the questions. This is much cooler.</p><p><strong>Ben:</strong> Yeah. We’ll try it out. I think it's going to work all right. It's like radio.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ben:</strong> So my main three senses of places that we could go further, which I want to say, and then you guys can figure out what seems juicy to you. And I think there probably is disagreement between you about how likely the win condition is going to involve substantial amounts of deliberate infection, whether it looks like herd immunity or whether alternative win conditions are necessary.&nbsp;</p><h2>Ick reactions to the idea of deliberate infection</h2><p><strong>Ben:</strong> I think another thing… so Robin talked about the ick reaction and I think one of my main guesses is for why people have an ick reaction is due to the potential for major downside from deliberate infection, the potential for either we do it in a bad way that it causes containment failure or just we infect a lot of people when there in fact was an alternative method that did not involve herd immunity and did not involve causing everyone to actually go through the disease.</p><p><strong>Ben:</strong> And so there would just be a massive number of deaths that would not necessarily need to happen. So that's my sense and – Zvi?</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> I mean I would say that, and I think Robin probably echos this based on what I've seen him write and say mostly, that those are not the main places the ick factor is coming from. Like those are the places that, sort of if you're trying to come up with reasonable objections, reasonably reasons people might be icked out, as opposed to the actual reason people get icked out.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> There is a place for responding to excuses even when they aren't the real reasons. They often force people to give a next excuse and a next excuse, and you finally maybe eventually get to the real reasons.</p><p><strong>Ben:</strong> But I do expect with some people, I agree that many people's reactions are not very thoughtful, but I think there's still pretty good solid reasons for some people’s responses.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> But I actually agree with Ben that in many, even rationalists’ minds, they have hope. And this in some sense feels like giving up on the hope, that is once you just try to infect many people, then you're giving up on the vaccine that will save us all or the squash that will kill it all. And they put a substantial hope on those things. And this feels like giving up.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Yes. And you're not allowed to give up. Like that's really terrible to give up on human lives.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Or to make a plan B in case you fail is even really terrible.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Yeah. Making a plan B is already like escapism and pretty terrible but certainly actually doing it before we're sure we didn't have a way...</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Not only making a plan B but exploring and putting resources into figuring out which plan B would be better.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Well because like you're stealing, I can just imagine-</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Stealing resources of plan A.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Right. Like people are dying because you didn't give them tests. Like how dare you sir. You could have built a hospital instead of building this research clinic.</p><p><strong>Ben:</strong> I see, so I do want to check, so that is an important question, whether it is giving up hope or whether it's a serious argument that this will not be necessary and it will on net just actually be damaging to go down that route.</p><h2>Is deliberate infection worthwhile near the peak?</h2><p><strong>Robin:</strong> So I had a couple of things that I thought we might be able to fit in. One is I just wanted to make a list of all the concrete things we could do because I realized we didn't include all of them. Another is we might be able to go over the bad arguments we agree are bad and that might be a connection we can make.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> And then the other thing I was thinking was the argument that... I say the data range is a factor of 3 to 30, so say it's only a factor of 3 in mortality reduction and say we're at the peak. Well this mortality reduction goes with all the other symptom reductions. That is all the way along the chain to death, you're also having weaker symptoms and less problems. So I would say if you take three people and you deliver the infectum, that's the equivalent of one ordinary person in terms of medical demand. So if you think most of those people are going to be infected near the peak anyway, it's not clear to me that even near the peak you shouldn't want to do deliberate infection in order to get that factor of 3, to cut down the medical demand by the factor of 3.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> If those resources don't have a better use somewhere else, including isolating people, my model says even if we're at the peak it's very possible to actually protect yourself if you're willing to take proper precautions.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Well, so my assumption is that you infect plus isolate. So my general policy is that in order not to accelerate and make the peak sharper, whoever you deliberately infect you immediately isolate. And that, it's in my calculations, my simulations, I accepted that displaces one other person who might be otherwise isolated. So then I'm not just assuming more isolation.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Right, the alternative is to isolate somebody who is not infected at all and have them just stay safe.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Right, but I was focused on the medical resources argument that if the argument is that at the peak you don't want to be doing this because you're taking away, you're adding to the load on medical resources. I'd say, well no you're not. That is, deliberate infection doesn't actually accelerate, doesn't actually sharpen the peak. It actually can flatten the peak and again you'd be swapping three people who will soon get infected anyway with one person who's now infected.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Well, it depends how long the peak lasts, right. If the peak is only a month, then by the time you let this person out, they could have just never been infected and the peak is already over and you've taken some amount of resources to help them. Whereas if the peak is going to last for longer, you can rotate people in and out and you can actually make progress, right.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> I mean, there are different kinds of quarantine or isolation resources depending on whether you're trying to prevent infections in or out from it. People you deliberately isolate, and in fact you're not so much trying to prevent infections coming in, you're trying to prevent infections from going out.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Right, after the first day or two where it could increase the viral load, you're like, okay, it's done, you're infected.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Right, so that's a different kind of resource.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> No, it's a cheaper isolation is the argument because normally you have to–</p><h2>Concretely discussing what deliberate infection looks like and comparison to work on isolation</h2><p><strong>Robin:</strong> You can basically have a hotel of people where they all come in on the same day and they all get infected the same day. They can wander around and meet with each other and do everything they want. They can all be in contact with each other, you can even have a university campus that way, armed guards around the edge. But everybody comes in on the same day.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> It's a little trickier. You still have to verify they're infected, right, because otherwise they'll get high viral during the secondary infection.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Right. So, the first day or two is the, they're isolated and individually infected. But then...</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Well, how fast do the tests work? My understanding is the tests take several days before you will get a positive swab from them because you haven't had the virus multiply enough yet. Is that right?</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Well, I mean in this case we could just say it's a week of isolation plus a month perhaps of sharing isolation.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Right. The first week is full cost, then you have to burn some tests and then you have a cheaper isolation after that.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Right.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Sorry, it's not clear to me... Like my isolation for example, right, how expensive you should consider it? If you actually know how to isolate like how hard is it? Just like...</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Well, but under your assumption that isolation isn't that hard, then by assumption this peak is not going to be all in one month. It'll be spread out perhaps over two or three months. Right. Your assumption about the feasibility of isolation is directly connected to your prediction about how sharp the peak is.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Right. It depends on... It's possible for some. Certainly one way one could invest if one had a lot of resources would be to actually improve isolation procedures to allow more people to be isolated and potentially flatten the curve.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> You know, for example, effective delivery of groceries or mail or something, if somehow it was easier to make that more clean then that could be a–</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> I certainly think there's, I certainly think that's another place that we could talk, we could think about, because nobody's really looking at it very hard right now as far as I can tell. And they're not scaling up very fast and obviously it's not the same thing where like we could convince everybody to suddenly do this giant thing that would have a huge impact. But certainly it's a possibility.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> I mean, again, I'm certainly not going to say the thing I'm proposing is the only thing worth doing, that certainly sounds worth doing. And in fact, in my experience I see all these firms telling me that they want to deliver me food and things and telling me they're being clean and just having some third party independent verification or certification of clean delivery could be a huge contribution. Maybe it's not so much some clever way to do it but just certifying that it is clean.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Yeah, that would certainly be good. Also, just ramping upscale. Just to speak from personal experience, we can't get delivery here because all the delivery slots have already been taken and as fast as they're appearing, they're just gone because of course price mechanisms, who knows what those are. So it's just a matter of furiously trying to click, so we're going to get you to pick up instead in the hopes that we'll actually be able to do that and then that's still, an order of magnitude better than going into the store, maybe two but like not great.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Right. Well, we can expect ordinary interest and market mechanisms to, over the next few months, to be honing and improving isolation mechanisms, right. And so if they succeed enough, then that will flatten the peak and that means we're not talking three weeks until the peak here. Maybe we're talking three months.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Right. I have a model where super spreading and different people taking different behaviors matters a lot, and so there sort of will be a peak amongst people who can't isolate. Where in the isolated people will actually ride it out. And then the people who aren't isolating will largely have recovered or have gotten sick and then situation changes.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> So the more this is spread out, the more an opportunity it is, at least for the last third of the distribution, for it to get deliberate infection.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> And then they can certainly consider it. So I think we strongly agree that if there was a practical way for us to be allowed to and actually run this experiment, it'd be much better... It would be a very good use of resources. I think we both agree there’s also a lot of other similar things you could do if you had the ability to engage in medical experiments on humans with live COVID. That would also be well worth doing and we can talk about exact procedures but...</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Well, so I mean this is simple enough that the question might be: do we necessarily need an officially sanctioned large and sponsored and run by a big major organization sorts of experiments or what sorts of smaller scale, more amateurish experiments could be done here that might be sufficient.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Yeah, I mean I'm not a legal scholar, I imagine that if anyone gets sick, you're in a hell of a lot of trouble, and you might even go to jail even if no-one does, because this is just...</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> I think you're especially probably in a lot of trouble if you're trying to sell this. If you're a for profit business and then you would be sued to death.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Oh, no. Yeah, a for profit business, no way.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> But if you were simply amateur people helping each other, then it's less clear that there would be much... That it could be done. Like if you help, showed somebody a kit for how to do deliberate infection and you posted the kit on the web and then some people decided to use the kit. Could you really be sued for them deliberately infecting themselves. Taking that risk might be worth it if you're just one person who– what can they get if they sue you?</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> I mean, I would not be worried about being sued, I would be somewhat worried about being sued, I'd also be worried about being criminally arrested.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Okay, but if we're talking, even the United States, I guess I recently did a bet with someone about a quarter million people in the US dying. If you could actually make a substantial cut in that, is that worth civil disobedience at some point. To hell with the rules.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> I'm not going to tell people not to do it if they're willing. I agree. I just, I'm trying to find a practically... Obviously also if you want people to report on and believe and use your findings, you really want to be able to do it as above board as possible, obviously</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Of course, but there's a trade-off here, but again, if there's a choice between doing something soon and fast and getting it done versus waiting six months for regulatory approval…</p><p><strong>Ben:</strong> So Zvi, I would like to just ask if you want to just take a minute to reflect and make sure you've hit all the key disagreements you had to bring up with Robins proposal.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> I would say I certainly had additional concerns about the proposal.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> As do I.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Yes, but I don't think it'd be necessarily a good use of time to bring them up right now. I think going to Q&amp;A.</p><p><strong>Ben:</strong> Yeah. And again, we'll go to Q and A in a minute. I will wait for Jacob to tell me that he's got two people ready, or got someone ready in the room.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Right.</p><p><strong>Ben:</strong> So we'll probably just go for another couple of minutes.</p><h2>Things that can be done to help</h2><p><strong>Robin:</strong> I'd like to just list the things that can be done here.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Yeah, let's do this.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Just in the hope of enticing someone to doing them. So I didn't mention before computer modeling, so a lot of people we know love to do computer things. So my little computer sim is badly done because I'm not in the habit of doing that a lot. But even just the question, would it be better to deliberately infect the older, the young if there is a large reduction due to dose is not obvious. And so it'd be worth doing some modeling to figure that out so people we know could do computer modeling of that.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Even coming up with a simple sort of dose experiment plan, if you were going to deliberately infect some people, just what would be your plan in terms of who gets what when and what you check. Somebody with competence in doing that should just figure out a plan. Those are two other things that I didn't mention before, but of course I mentioned before, some sort of facilities planning either for a legal thing you're doing above board to figure out what place you buy and who do you hire and what do you staff it with and what's the plan there, or some perhaps amateur coordination thing and what would be the plan there. Legal research about figuring out what versions are legal and then some sort of literature review to better pin down what our reference points for other data on low dosage effects in viruses like this are.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Yeah, I would add to that. So we need people who actually know biology and immunology and how to work with viruses who can potentially explore how to do it, physically, if we actually-</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> How to create a low dose, what would be the best mechanical way to isolate it, save it, and then deliver it.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> If anybody knows how to potentially find leverage with people who are in regulatory agencies, potentially get approval, that would be potentially very helpful. One thing I was thinking was we could try and actually just gather data via, I mean it's not as good as doing experiments, but certainly we could try to use surveys and asking questions to try and find out more about the people who actually just naturally got infected and how they got infected and how that compares to how their cases went and just try to see if we can establish something that way.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Well, in fact there was a study I saw on China recently which looked at how people got infected in terms of the chance they got infected, but it just didn't look at death rates. So maybe we could just get their data and re crunch it and figure out how death rates relate to the mode of infection.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Right. You look for more natural experiments, look for places where we can ask these questions.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> But quite often you don't need a new experiment. You just need to go find old experiments people didn't analyze right and just get their data and re crunch it.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Yeah. I mean that sounds promising too, and obviously if we wanted to do this with building facilities and such, having somebody who's willing to back it on a philanthropic basis would be wonderful. I think going to a grant is hopeless in this situation for obvious reasons. I don't think that-</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Just, I wasn't applying for a grant, I was just applying for them to put my proposal in text on their website.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> I think even that's pretty hopeless. I think what you're hoping for is specific people who have... Specific people who have a lot of money, billionaires and multi-millionaires who-</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Opportunistically find people who can help, obviously. Yes.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Yeah.</p><h1>Q&amp;A</h1><h2>What could go horribly wrong? – from Oli Habryka</h2><p><strong>Ben:</strong> All right. I think we have a first questioner. So I'm going to invite them in the room and ask them to tell us who they are and what their question is. I think I maybe know who this person is.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Oh, that guy.</p><p><strong>Ben:</strong> Good afternoon Oliver Habryka.</p><p><strong>Oliver:</strong> Hello.</p><p><strong>Ben:</strong> Yo, what's your question?</p><p><strong>Oliver:</strong> Great. So my question is, my current emotional status is something like this all... Something about this seems really good, but what I really want is two of you giving a bit of background on what could possibly go horribly wrong with this. Some of my intuitions are that this seems good, but a part of me just assigns some probability of this going horribly wrong. A case might be that our viral load… it turns out we mis-measure drastically and we increase it drastically. We completely block a containment measure. What are the guesses that you have for just what is the worst case that could happen? What is the probability of that and what are some easy ways we could mitigate that?</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> I'd say obviously in the amateur scenario, if you are trying to create samples and store them and deliver them, you could accidentally infect people with other things by doing a bad job of that whole process. So there's a reason why professionals produce medicines in the way they do, in the way they store them, and the way they deliver them. Amateurs trying to produce substitute, that would be a bad scenario, right. So I'd much rather have a professional do this than amateurs to avoid those sorts of scenarios, right.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> You could imagine, they just infect it with some other random thing in the process of packaging it together and poking you with a needle or whatever they're going to do. You can just screw that up. That would be one. And obviously another thing is, say some church likes this idea, their pastor goes wild for it. They do a big thing and then they screw something else up and they all commit suicide and that's in the news... And this gets associated with some weird disliked group and then that's the death of it, right.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> I mean, certainly we have to worry about facing giant social backlash. Whoever tries it facing potential legal backlash, stuff like that. Shut down attempts. But when we ask... I think bigger, what could possibly go horribly wrong. So one thing that could go horribly wrong potentially is that the selection pressures of the procedure somehow cause the virus to mutate in a very nasty way that causes it to be harder to detect or last longer or something like that. Because you're quarantining everybody for... You're infecting tons of people and then quarantining them for just long enough that you're expected to die and then the version of it that can live for 50 days and still spread without being symptomatic suddenly gets out and now everybody has to quarantine for twice as long and it's a disaster.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Just to be clear, we're already risking those sorts of things with lock down. I mean people have suggested that...</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Potentially you're increasing the probability of that happening. I brainstorming things that could go horribly wrong. Right. Second thing that could go horribly wrong is as was discussed on Twitter this morning, if people aren't immune for that long, I think we both agreed that it's going to be more than a few months almost all the time, but if we infect everybody and a year from now a variation comes out because it's still endemic no matter what we do. And then it comes back and previous SARS in style, coronavirus style infections, in some cases prior immunity to other strains has made infections worse. So by infecting a larger percentage of people, even though they recovered, you could set yourself up for bigger problems down the line.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> But that's a problem with any way in which most people eventually get infected. That's not particular to deliberate infection mechanism. It's just, if we let most people get infected then we risk that scenario.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> I mean I'm assuming with deliberate infection we end up infecting, I was assuming we ended up infecting more people than we would have otherwise.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> I'm not assuming that.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Well, right, I was thinking once we have the ability to infect people relatively safely, versus taking that risk, we kind of would keep going. But I don't know.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> I mean there would be a moment in time where you could pull the trigger and then deliberately infect everybody, say within a month, if the vaccine showed up in the first week, then you would say, oh my goodness...</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Right. The obvious other thing that could happen is the vaccine shows up a month later or a treatment shows up later and then everybody goes, the horror, the horror–</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> We should've waited.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> And also everything like this has a bad name forever, right. The next time this happens that we have to do this, they don't do it. They probably wouldn't have anyway, but they even more won't do it next time.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> That's actually a good point to make here, which is that the biggest payoff I think from doing this isn't for this, it's as a practice for the next time when it matters even more. That is, we will eventually have even worse pandemics and one of the biggest benefits of this pandemic is that we are forced to take this seriously and think through some of these things such that we will be more ready next time.</p><p><strong>Ben:</strong> Did that answer your question as you wanted it Oliver? Is there any follow ups you'd like to ask, or any more specifics?</p><p><strong>Oliver:</strong> I think that basically answered most of it. I think I would be interested in a rough probability estimate or something like that, or just an overall judgment. Like “Yep, I recognize that those are some downside risks, overall I think they're sizable, or overall I think they're not really worth exploring more, investing more.” Just to get a sense of where currently modular intellectual progress can be made in this topic.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Yeah. I'm just focused on the factor of 3 to 30, gain and reducing death rates. I mean that can buy you a lot of risk. You should be willing to take a fair bit of risk to buy that.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Yeah. I think that the social slash legal risks of whoever tries it are very high probability, especially if not done very carefully or slash with official approvals. But I don't think that the downsides that I was talking about are very likely. I think it was just a matter of what might go horribly wrong and those are the things that I can imagine going truly horribly wrong with it. Or I think some kind of backfire that does reputational damage is not that unlikely either, but probably pretty big underdog relative to just not happening.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> The other question is how probable is, if we do this plan B, it's going to work and be a good idea, et cetera. I think that in the scenario where we are stuck in some form of lockdown for six plus months effectively, where we're doing real economic damage the whole time, the chances it's a good idea is pretty high. Certainly more than 25%, quite possibly more like half. I think there's a decent number of reasons why... That's assuming we could actually test it and then have a place where we could implement it without just being told no. Right. I think the most likely scenario is that–</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Well, I should mention, it's a big world. There's over a hundred nations out there.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Yeah. We might convince, like, Singapore to do it.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> And just getting someplace in the world to try it would be a substantial gain from the point of view not of just saving lives but creating a precedent for the future.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> That's a fair point. I certainly think that if you got anyone to implement it, if it was right, it would be a pretty big deal assuming if it worked out and proved to be a win. I think that the scenarios where it's a good idea potentially are an underdog versus the scenarios where it's not. Where either it's all over too fast or we manage to control it, but I have very high uncertainty about all of that and certainly I don't think any of these numbers should discourage people from thinking about the problem because again, if you think of the upside is as big as Robin thinks it is. And I think that's a reasonable thing to think it might be, even if I think it's somewhat lower, it's still pretty big. And you think that you have a chance to move that lever somewhat, then unless you have a better idea, if you want to do something relevant to the situation, it's a reasonable thing to work on from a perspective of someone like us. That sound about right? Even if it's likely not going to work. A better question is how do you make it likely to get a chance. How do we make sure that if it does work, that we tried it.</p><p><strong>Ben:</strong> All right. Thanks Oli. Thank you very much and I'm going to kick you out of this call.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> No more Oliver.</p><h2>Should effective altruists spend time on Covid-19? – From Daniel Filan</h2><p><strong>Ben:</strong> Remove. All right, next questioner, enter. Hey Daniel.</p><p><strong>Daniel:</strong> Hello.</p><p><strong>Ben:</strong> Which country are you calling from? I'm going to guess Berkeley.</p><p><strong>Daniel:</strong> I would actually consider Berkeley to not be a country and say that I'm calling from the United States of America.</p><p><strong>Ben:</strong> Okay. You win that one. What's your question?</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> I'm not sure he's right. Go ahead.</p><p><strong>Daniel: </strong>My question is, effective altruists up until recently spent a bunch of their time worrying about the world ending or about saving however many animals from dying per year of factory farming and all sorts of things. This disease sort of, if you look at it, it seems like maybe a couple percent of the world could die from it. That'd be bad, but it doesn't seem like, naively, it doesn't seem to be on the same scale as everybody in the world dying, or on the scale of other things that effective altruists typically worry about. So should we really be spending our time thinking about this and debating and such.</p><p><strong>Ben:</strong> Okay. Thanks, thoughts guys?</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Was it a yes or no question? Yes.</p><p><strong>Daniel:</strong> Maybe why is the question.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Yeah, do you want to go first Robin?</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> I mean obviously the trite answer is you should multiply the probability times the leverage you have and stuff that you can do, that this is right in front of you and so it makes sense to... Even effective altruists shouldn't just focus on ending the world scenarios, they should look at the wide range of large versus small scenarios and look opportunistically where they can help. But certainly one of the biggest ending the world scenarios that people have focused on over the years is pandemics and this is a pandemic. This isn't a world ending pandemic, but the habits and approaches that are legitimized in this case and that are developed in this case will be the main resources we have if and when a really bigger one shows up. So, it's well worth making this one go right just so we could be better prepared for a much bigger one.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> And also, so other things to point out, one of which is I think this is more of an x-risk or approaching x-risk, than you're giving it credit for. In the sense that for example, this could lead to a US–China war, which could be very, very bad. This could lead to lasting severe economic damage, which would be very, very bad. Potentially even collapse of civil order under some scenarios. And if we don't get immunity for very long, this could be an actual civilizational threat. If this comes every year and is this bad because we can't shut down the economy like this every year, and it's not clear that we can sustain ourselves. So there are risks.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> But more than that I would point out, x-risk is a small percentage of what effective altruists worry about. Some of them worry about animals, some of them worry about malaria nets and giving directly to poor people to make sure they can start small businesses. And those are two of the big networks, both of which get a lot more money than x-risk, as far as I... If my model is correct as concerned. So I don't see why this is remotely inappropriate and in fact, I have been very disappointed and puzzled by the failure of effective altruists to move a bunch of resources and money towards these problems when people in our community were very, very good about sounding the alarm that this was coming. We had a lot of opportunities, still have a lot of opportunity and where is Open Phil?</p><p><strong>Ben:</strong> Let me briefly mention to listeners, please go to LessWrong and Jacob is pinging a bunch of you. Please refresh the page to check whether you have notifications, et cetera. What did you want to say Dan? Was that, are you now convinced that folks should now be spending a bunch of time on the pandemic thing?</p><p><strong>Daniel:</strong> Kind of. I just wanted to say OpenPhil really is funding some forecasting work and, I don't know, they're not doing nothing.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> So, I wanted to mention that in most other areas of altruistic concerns, one of the big issues that come back again and again it's governance. People have various ways they hope the world can be improved, then they face governance limits. The governance gets in the way. Governance isn't there to solve the problem. We will be changing governance in response to this crisis. We already are changing governance in response to the crisis. How governance changes in response to this crisis will be crucial in terms of whether it opens it up or shuts down ways that we could coordinate on other important questions.</p><p><strong>Ben:</strong> Yeah. I wanted to briefly add that we're currently finding out how good our institutions are at dealing with a pandemic and a lot of people are currently quite surprised that the CDC is not preparing well enough and encouraging people to just do basic things in a timely enough fashion.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> The CDC, the WHO, the FDA, have all done really badly. Another thing before we get to that, I want to point out that a lot of EA's often talk about meta EA work about raising the profile of an attractiveness of and status of EA to get more resources, to get more people working. And if EA proved instrumental in helping with this crisis, then that would be a tremendous boost to EAs profile, and EA's ability to acquire resources and goodwill and so on. And so, even if you didn't value the lives of the pandemic, I think you should still work on this.</p><p><strong>Daniel:</strong> Yeah, I would say that checking how good our governance institutions are is like, maybe we don't need to do it right now, but yeah, the raising-EA's-profile by helping out in a thing everyone wants help with, that seems pretty plausible.</p><p><strong>Ben:</strong> Cool. Thank you very much Daniel. I am now going to kick you out.</p><p><strong>Daniel:</strong> Okay. Bye.</p><p><strong>Ben:</strong> Farewell. All right. Next question is still coming in a few minutes. Is there any other points you wanted to come back on?&nbsp;</p><h2>What probability does Zvi assign to us needing to deliberately infect? – From Ben Pace</h2><p><strong>Ben:</strong> I guess I still was interested in trying to get your sense Zvi of the probability that the successful outcome here involves a herd immunity strategy that is greatly informed by doing a bunch of deliberate exposure versus the likelihood we will end up with a different sort of win condition that did not require that.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Also, I say that sort of you have to separate it out into, conditional on the world stays otherwise unchanged and we find a way to give the world that option and they would take it, if it was the right thing to do, versus what's the chance in practice that it happens? I think that second number is very, very low. I think that in practice everybody hates it. We do not have that many resources and we are unlikely to be able to make this happen. Not that we shouldn't try, but that conditional on it being right, it's still a large underdog, like 10% or less to happen.</p><p><strong>Ben:</strong> What is your answer to the first question?</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Well, the answer to the first question... So I'm very much less confident in that answer, but I would say maybe roughly 30% that we end up in a scenario where deliberate infection of non-trivial numbers of people is the right thing to do. And not just people in key specific conditions, but like a large percentage of the population, would be the right thing to do if we could pull it off. I also worry that just our civilization, the same way it wasn't able to stop the pandemic in the first place, just doesn't have the coordination to pull this off.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> The scenario that I find most likely and disturbing is that all the hope that's generated lately for a lot more testing and a lot more tracing and a lot more isolation, the same government agencies are going to be implementing that, that already implemented the failure before, and they just won't pull it off. And that'll consistently happen all through the West and therefore this will just get really big. And then it'll go back and re-infect even China and Korea, et cetera, who had been keeping it out until a much larger way of comebacks comes back to hit them. And then there'll be this vast amount of death and all this finger pointing and all these recriminations and all this blaming. And that's a pretty bad scenario, but it seems to me the most likely one. I'm happy to support, hope and to help the hopeful scenarios try to develop, but I still can't put a huge probability on them.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> I think the reason I'm more hopeful than you are is because I don't see this as primarily resting upon the government being competent because I think that the people and the corporations and the non-governmental resources will pull this together and get us through this in a lot of scenarios, despite the government, right? Through the government's resistance. That's kind of a lot of what's happening already.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> But in that scenario, counterfactually we have a flatter peak than we otherwise would have. But still, most people get infected and an awful lot of people die, basically. You're cutting down the extra deaths that would've happened if everybody got sick in the same two weeks because maybe now everybody gets sick in the same two months or three months. But still, basically, most everybody gets sick and half a percent of them die and–</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> I mean when people isolate, mostly the government can tell them to isolate and it seems to be pretty bad at getting them and forcing them to isolate when they don't want to. But it has the persuasive ability of the media and the people and whatever, how did that convince a large number of people to isolate and that number will go up. And I do think the people who isolate will be mostly safe.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> I mean they'll be safe for a few months, but that's not the same as safe. If a vaccine takes two years or five years to come, I don't see how they're safe for five years.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Yeah. I agree that five years is a long time, but–</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Two years. I don't see how you can keep them safe for two years. All these people with, even yourself, isolated. Two years of staying isolated, the whole economy adjusting to isolation... That is a really tall bar.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> So when we talk about testing capabilities, right, that's a key part of this. I see the government's role in testing as not stopping it from happening, as what they have to do. The government doesn't create tests.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Okay. But in equilibrium, on average, how often is each person tested, do you imagine?</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> So I imagine–</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Once a week? I mean, come on.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> I think maybe more–</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Once a year maybe.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> I think maybe a lot more than that.</p><h2>How soon to herd immunity?</h2><p><strong>Ben:</strong> All right, the people coming on is kind of slow, so I'm going to ask a few questions that people submitted. And then if anyone else joins in we'll add them, but otherwise hopefully we'll have it more streamlined for next time. So I've been sent a few comments. So someone has said, ""I think we are unlikely to hit herd immunity levels of infection in the US in the next two years. I would like to see Robin and Zvi discuss whether they also think that or not, since this bears on the value of Robin's proposal and lots of other things.""</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Well, that's what we were just talking about. How plausible is it that people can just stay isolated for the next two years? Well, a majority of the population stay isolated enough for the next two years not to catch this?</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Well, I mean the scenario that I think is most likely is that a significant number of people get infected but not enough to achieve herd immunity, if we completely returned to previous activities that people still attended their sporting events and their weddings and their buffets and so on, at the same frequency as before and shook hands all the time and so on. But we will make a significant number of adjustments on those levels, probably including getting behind wearing masks. I think that's probably a few weeks away at most at this point. It seems like people have gotten over their initial, ""Wearing masks makes you a pariah,"" thing. And together with a lot of people in potential super-spreader positions being immune because they already got infected, and people taking various degrees of precautions, I think we can get R0 below one. And then it's not that hard to contain outbreaks as they happen. I think that's the most–</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> That just seems to me a crazily ambitious scenario. I mean, I'm just very impressed by how complicated the world is, how uncoordinated the world is–</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Well, the reason why I'm confident in it is because I don't see us as having to check off the following six boxes. I see it as a mathematical formula, where you have to do enough things to get below R0 = 1.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> So say some places are below one and others are above one, unfortunately the nature of exponential weighting is that even if 85% of things are below one and 15% are above, on average you still have growth. So it's that last percent of the deviance to really put most of the weight on, because this is an exponential growing thing. So it's not enough that half the people, half the places have an R0 below 1. That doesn't do it.</p><p><strong>Ben:</strong> All right.&nbsp;</p><h2>Why isn't China doing deliberate infection?</h2><p><strong>Ben:</strong> Let me jump in and ask one more question before I think we're going to get another audio person. Someone's there saying, ""As an authoritarian country with not much consideration of medical ethics, China is able to try the deliberate infection rate. They also have plenty of medical expertise, so this idea was probably considered. Furthermore, if it was successful, I would expect them to announce that or at least for the information to be leaked. Is there a plausible story here for why we haven't heard about it yet?""</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Well, I mean, they're humans with the same sort of human reluctance to consider various areas as we are, so the average Chinese isn't that different from the average person of us. It's more, does their structure select out and generate it more than ours might? So I could believe that somebody in the Chinese government has generated this option; there's a white paper or something that's submitted to some higher levels sitting on somebody's desk. But then I presume the reaction above is, ""Well, at the moment we've locked this down. This isn't ..."" I would think the moment when they were considering that would be when they were facing a wave from across the shores, where they were feeling like, ""Either we lock down our borders and then we're really hurting our economy or we expose ourselves,"" and that's the moment when they would consider deliberate infection. But they, like us, probably would find it looks bad PR to talk about it, so they would probably be privately setting it up as an option to consider, but not publicly talking about it. Because if they weren't going to do it soon–</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> They have less barriers in some ways, but definitely not no barriers. And I think they'd have to consider whether or not trying to do this would already be a disaster for them because I think my motto of–</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Their story is they beat it, right? Their story is they fought it and they beat it, so they have to give up on that story to go with deliberate infection. At some point maybe they'll do that, but they don't want to do that now. They like this story.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> The story came out two days ago that the Chinese movie theaters got shut down and a lot of people were like, ""Oh my God. Maybe China is just lying about everything and actually things are terrible."" I mean the story about urns in Wuhan, it implies that maybe they were 46,000 deaths and-</p><p><strong>Ben:</strong> All right, let me introduce another guest. You may have a sense of who this person is.&nbsp;</p><h2>What does Zvi think the effects of this negative shock will be on our institutions? – From Alyssa Vance</h2><p><strong>Ben:</strong> Hello, is Alyssa there?</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> I've ever seen this person in my life.</p><p><strong>Alyssa Vance:</strong> So, Zvi, you wrote in your Moral Mazes sequence about the impact that negative shocks have on society, and how in past social equilibria negative shocks were important, and in some sense necessary, to stop institutions from becoming sufficiently bad. Obviously, this is a large negative shock. Various people have said that it's the biggest shock to the world, the Western civilization, since World War II. Last month, various people were pontificating about how, ""Oh you know, this might be the end of the Chinese regime."" Now various people are pontificating about how it might be the end of the West. If people can switch their stories so frequently and not explain why the previous story was wrong, I'm not sure I trust them very much. Do you have any specific thoughts on how this particular negative shock will impact the particular institutions that we have? How this is an example of the previous theory?</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Right, so the thing I was saying when I got sort of cut off was that the Chinese might not be considering deliberate infection because they think that if it was so bad they needed to do deliberate infection, that their regime would end regardless of what they did, so why plan for it? I think sometimes authoritarians just sort of do things like that. ""Well, if it's that bad, we just have to suppress it even harder/pretend it doesn't exist and hope for the best."" But I just don't have that great a model of China. In terms of what might happen, a lot of companies are going to fail. That much is very obvious, right? A lot of small businesses will fail. A lot of big businesses will almost certainly also fail. The bailouts are not that big and won't save them if they're inherently unprofitable in any way.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> And others will take their place, and a lot of that could be very good, and there'll be a lot of degradation of trust in a lot of major institutions because they lied their asses off to us and proved themselves incompetent. And in some ways that's bad, but in most ways, in the long run, that's very good. And in general, it could be seen as creative destruction, the equivalent of urban renewal, just like a bunch of stuff got torn down and it's sad that a lot of people died, and sad that a lot of people are broke and don't have money, but when things come roaring back, there's an opportunity to do more innovation and change.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Obviously, we'll be much more receptive to doing things remotely in various ways. Zoom is up 8x, not just because they think they'll make money in the next three months, but because once people will start doing Zoom, they'll realize we can talk like this and then maybe they'll keep doing it. I think that like the predictions of the universities dying are plausible because it's a lot of money to pay for something. If you learn, you can get it somewhere else. And similarly, a lot of people will realize that schools were a terrible idea when they don't have them for a while, I'm guessing.</p><p><strong>Alyssa Vance:</strong> Do you think universities and schools will be... So summer vacation, or what would have been summer vacation, is coming up for two months. Do you think everything will be shut down past then?</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Yes, I think certainly there's almost no chance they'll reopen this semester. I think that is basically null. Or if they do, they'll be like... Yeah, I think Liberty University reopened because they're insane.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> The question is August. Will universities reopen in August.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> I think there's a decent chance they can open in August. But there's also a decent chance that a lot of people don't want to come, even if they try to open in August because they've learned they can... People have summer breaks all the time, but when you actually try to learn from home, you realize that... A huge percentage of what I did in college was a mix of opportunities for socialization I didn't use because I was an introvert nerd and reading books and working through problems. And I can do that at home.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> I think I disagree a lot with this one with Zvi, probably more than anything else in this entire thing. I think universities are going to do just fine. People will realize they missed their friends and hanging out with other people at school and they will want to come back and do it. The kids don't like staying at home and not seeing the other kids. They want to be with other kids, but that–</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> I hated school so maybe that's biasing a lot of my perspective.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Oh, kids hate school, but they love to be with the other students. They want to hate school together. They hate to hate school alone.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Yeah. It seems like you should be able to goal factor this though very effectively. College is very expensive.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> I was going to make the comment about... we like to think that we're going to collect evidence here and then we'll find out better ways of doing things. But one of the big things that's going to happen is people will be desperate to construct stories about who wins and who loses and who was right and who was wrong through this whole thing, and those stories don't have to be accurate. And there'll be a lot of collateral damage from the stories that when crushing some true things that aren't convenient. So even if, for example, deliberate infection showed that it worked, if the best story that came out that won didn't like that, it might well say it was bad. And if you just look at history of past crises and see what actually happened versus the stories people tell afterwards, it's not that strong a correlation.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> So I mean there's also some other economic impacts. I expect VIX to be permanently higher. I expect loan options to be permanently more expensive or at least for a decade or two. I expect companies-</p><p><strong>Alyssa Vance:</strong> VIX is the Volatility Index.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> The Volatility Index, like the people's predictions, to be higher. I expect options that are well out of the money to be more expensive for at least a decade, probably longer. I expect our companies to be much more cognizant of their supply chains and how to work from home and what would happen if something similar like this happens again. In general, I expect people to actually prepare for such a thing. They were prepared for the last war, even if they don't prepare for the next one. Right? Yeah. So there'll be a lot of that, and probably a lot of international trade.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> And travel.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> And travel. Yeah.</p><p><strong>Ben:</strong> Okay. Alyssa is that a solid answer? Is there anything in particular you wanted to push back on?</p><p><strong>Alyssa Vance:</strong> I mean, you could go on forever, but that was great. Thank you.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Yep. All right.</p><p><strong>Ben:</strong> Yes, we could go on forever. Cool. All right. Thanks a lot, Alyssa. All right, I'll invite the next questioner in and then probably this will be the last question and we'll wrap up. All right.&nbsp;</p><h2>What specific information does Robin think we can get from deliberate infection that we cannot get from natural data? – From Lotus Cobra</h2><p><strong>Ben:</strong> All I have down for this person is Lotus Cobra, which, if it's a name, is awesome. Hey, are you there?</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Three two, one.</p><p><strong>Lotus Cobra:</strong> Hi. I can't hear you so well.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Try playing a land.</p><p><strong>Lotus Cobra:</strong> Sorry. Hi, can you hear me now?</p><p><strong>Ben:</strong> Yeah, I can hear you.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Fantastic.</p><p><strong>Ben:</strong> Feel free to say who you are and where you're from, insofar as you would like to give identifying information.</p><p><strong>Lotus Cobra:</strong> All right, I am Lotus Cobra. Some people might know me as Bar Fight. I'm calling in from Canada right now, and I've been following LessWrong for about 10 years now, but I created an account like 20 minutes ago just to ask this question.</p><p><strong>Ben:</strong> Wow, it's a momentous occasion. All right, please tell us your awesome question.</p><p><strong>Lotus Cobra:</strong> Yes, I felt like this warranted it and, like Alyssa, I had to dig out an old computer to get this running so I couldn't get the video working. Sorry. This isn't a privacy thing. I literally couldn't turn the camera on.</p><p><strong>Ben:</strong> No worries. It's totally cool. So what's your question?</p><p><strong>Lotus Cobra:</strong> All right, so my question is, this one's more for Robin, although everyone feel free to join in. The deliberate exposure plan has evolved pretty substantially since it first came out in the middle of February. But right now, what advantage or what information do you expect to gain from deliberately infecting say 10,000 people with COVID-19, that we're not going to get from longitudinal studies, the natural experiments you were talking about earlier? And do you think this information is going to be worth all of the risks that we've gone over so far? The reputational risks potentially, but also the worst case scenarios. What if infection does not provide protection in the future? That kind of thing.</p><p><strong>Ben:</strong> Cool. Thanks. Robin, what are the main benefits?</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> So, I mean, if you start with the cost. If you took 10,000 people, then the half a percent mortality means you're talking 50 people, right? So right there, if you screw it up, you will have killed more or less than the 50 people you could have, so that's a huge personal responsibility to take, no matter what. But of course–</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> To be fair, if they're all 23, you [will only] kill one or two.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Right, exactly. So which case is more of a problem? You need a bigger experiment with younger people to see what affects the mortality rate, although you can track other symptoms. The main thing you hope to gain ... There's two main things you hope to gain. You want to know specifically how to produce a low dose infection reliably. You want to know how to take the original infectious virus, how to store it, how to transform it, how to deliver it to the body, how to do that reliably, and what the dose is that puts you in the right range of most people get infected but they're not infected very much. And then how can you tell us who is. So the other sorts of data is just not going to tell you that. It would take a long time with other sorts of longitudinal data to get you that sort of data about exactly how to infect people so that they have a low dose.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> And the other thing you would get, which is perhaps even more important, is most of the world just does not believe abstract arguments. Most of the world needs to see a concrete demonstration of something before they're going to take it seriously. If we actually had it happening at an actual facility, even with only a hundred people at a time, you'd have newspaper articles about it, you'd have people talking about it, they could imagine that happening, and then they could debate whether that was a good idea, in a far more involved way than they would if we just have abstract blog posts. That would probably be the main benefit is just to say, ""Look, this is concrete and it's real and it's a sort of thing you could do.""</p><p><strong>Ben:</strong> Cool. Thanks. Lotus, do you feel that was an answer to your question?</p><p><strong>Lotus Cobra: </strong>Yeah, I think it does. I don't really have any other questions except to thank both of you for coming out. Take care.</p><p><strong>Ben:</strong> Thank you. Cool. Thanks, Lotus. I'm going to send you out of the room now. Thanks a lot. And yes [Robin and Zvi], thank you for coming out, and by coming out we mean sitting in your homes and not leaving in any way.&nbsp;</p><h2>On what scale does Robin think deliberate infection will be needed? – From Elizabeth Van Nostrand</h2><p><strong>Ben:</strong> All right, I'm going to invite the last questioner who is on the call, which is Miss Elizabeth Van Nostrand. Hey, Elizabeth. Are you there?</p><p><strong>Elizabeth: </strong>Yeah.</p><p><strong>Ben:</strong> What's your question?</p><p><strong>Elizabeth:</strong> So I don't have the sense of what scale Robin is talking about deliberately infecting people on. Is it like we do a couple of brave volunteers and they staff things? Is it we gradually do half the population?</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Right, so that's exactly in a sense one of the main problems with trying to make policy proposals, is that that distinction gets muddled up. The simplest thing to talk about is the thing that would ultimately happen. But if you're trying to talk about the thing that would ultimately happen, people immediately respond with, ""But look at all the uncertainties. How could you possibly know how to do that right?"" And of course what you really want to propose is that you start down a path that could get to that big thing, but that along that path you would be doing small things that would be telling you all the key things you need to know about how to do the big thing right. Or even whether to quit and don't do the big thing.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> So I am talking about both. I mean, we can't talk about the short things without talking about the big things too, because the whole point of doing the small things is to prepare for, and to lay the groundwork for, the big things. But it's stupid to just pretend like we could know exactly how to do the big things right out from the bat. So in any policy area, including this, this is for all policy whatsoever, you're always talking at these two different levels of trying to imagine the thing you'd eventually do and how that would play out and whether that was a good idea. And then trying to think about what path you would use to get there in terms of what experiments you do, what permission you ask for, what trials you do, and what variations, so that you could learn not only how to do it right, but also create demonstrations and motivation and excitement and energy and attention, such that we might eventually get to the big things.</p><p><strong>Elizabeth:</strong> So are there things where if we ran a couple of small experiments, that would convince you we shouldn't continue?</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Well sure, like neighbors come with shotguns and shoot everybody because they're really offended by the whole thing. I mean, it means you don't do it that way. You have to go much more isolated, for example. Obviously, if it turns out there's some really strange effect where you modify the virus the way you thought was harmless and irrelevant, but it turns out to make it much more harmful and then a lot more people die and you go, ""Well, I guess I didn't really understand this at all."" Right?</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> So, for example, I know that one way in experiments in the past that people have used to infect people with say the flu, is just play cards. You have somebody with the flu and a bunch of other people without the flu and they play cards together. You know what, people catch the flu. That is a mechanism of deliberate infection. So it's just showing you, there is a lot of very straightforward mechanisms, but you could pick some clever mechanism that you thought was clever and that you were wrong. You mix it with lemon juice, you don't think lemon juice matters, but somehow it does.</p><p><strong>Ben:</strong> But, okay. Robin, I hear you're saying before you do the big things, you should do small scale tests, but in the world where it is, the plan B and deliberate infection is the primary solution mechanism, I'm curious what your mainline expectation is for the rough percentage of, I don't know, the US population or something you expect should be deliberately infected?</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Well, I mean, since like the natural R0 of this thing is what, like four or something, then you can calculate from that the percentage of the population you need to be infected in order to get herd immunity, which is like 80% or something, 70%-80%. So that's the number of people you need to be infected one way or the other, and once it works you might as well use it in the sense that like with smallpox, there was no, ""Infect some people with the smallpox thing variolation and other people in other way."" They were trying to get it to enough people so that basically they stopped it.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> So I will point out that I don't think it's as simple as infecting 80%. I think the different people matter a lot more or less,and et cetera, et cetera. And you can do very different things. But yeah, we are almost out of time, so I won't–</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Or on the order of half the population.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Yeah, I think we did get on the order of half, yeah. Minus whoever's already infected.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Right. And so the longer you wait, the less opportunity you'll have to infect the other people who could have had a much smaller reaction to it because they could've had a much smaller version.</p><p><strong>Ben:</strong> All right. Elizabeth, was there any follow up you had on that or is–</p><p><strong>Elizabeth:</strong> I'm good, thanks.</p><p><strong>Ben:</strong> Cool. Thanks. I'm going to take you out of the room.&nbsp;</p><h2>Ending</h2><p><strong>Ben:</strong> All right. I think that's a wrap.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> I'd like to thank my co-debater for being reasonable and intelligent and thoughtful. And I'm pretty sure if I debate anybody else on this topic in the next month, it will be a much more hostile engagement.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> And I will echo, yes.</p><p><strong>Ben:</strong> Yeah, no, thanks. This has been mad. I think I asked you both to do this on Monday or something insane–</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> Something like that.</p><p><strong>Ben:</strong> –so thanks a lot for getting available quickly. Appreciate it. A bunch of people, like a hundred people, have been watching throughout most of this, so that's ... Yeah, this is quite exciting. So next, there is an online meetup that you can join. We are going to try the open-source sort of VR platform, Mozilla Hubs. You're welcome to find it on LessWrong. There's a link to a bunch of rooms you can join. I assign some probability to this being awesome and some probability to this not working out at all. And in about 20 to 25 minutes, we'll have a good sense of that and we will put up a link to a Discord server instead if it seems to not be working.</p><p><strong>Ben:</strong> But I am going to be heading into the Mozilla Hubs chat rooms and I expect I will chat with a bunch of you guys there. Is there anything else I wanted you to say before this thing wrapped up? The one thing I forgot to say at the beginning, which was another thing that's inspiring wanting debates for a while, was there was an amazing ... One of, I think, Oli’s favorite Wikipedia pages is the Wikipedia page for The Scientific Revolution. And at the end of one of the sentences there, there's a sort of a lead-up sentence and it has no citations and no links and no further explanation and it just says, ""And there were many philosophical battles."" And that's been going around our head for a while and why I wanted to start having a bunch of debates, and this was just quite fun. So thanks both for joining, and have a good time quarantining your homes for over the next couple of months. And I'll see you again.</p><p><strong>Zvi:</strong> That is the plan.</p><p><strong>Ben:</strong> Yeah. All right. Thanks a lot. Farewell.</p></body></html>",Benito,benito,Ben Pace,

<p><span>Ultimately, it’s always all been about R0.</span></p>
<p><span>If you get and keep R0 substantially below one, infections fall off. Covid-19 is squashed.</span></p>
<p><span>If you can keep R0 below one and let normal life happen, life can return to normal. If you can’t, life can’t.</span></p>
<p><span>If R0 remains above one, infections continue to rise until something changes.</span></p>
<p><span>What will it take to do that?</span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><span>Interventions that reduce contact and exposure, or reduce the danger of each contact or exposure, or change their dynamics in useful ways, reduce R0. Every person already infected is almost certainly immune (at least for now) which also reduces R0.</span></p>
<p><span>You need some combination of interventions and immunity from previous infection that sufficiently reduces the initial R0.</span></p>
<p><span>This is not an</span><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O-ring_theory_of_economic_development""> <span>o-ring production function</span></a><span>. You are not as vulnerable as your weakest link. Not everything you do has to be correct. This isn’t a designed puzzle where there are </span><i><span>exactly enough </span></i><span>interventions available to solve the problem and you need to do them all. Instead, we have a variety of possible actions and need to pick the cheapest basket that reliably accomplishes the mission.</span></p>
<h3><b>What Was Initial R0?</b></h3>
<p><span>As Robin notes, R0 does not start out and never is one number. It depends on the surrounding disease environment. In some places it will start out very high. I’ve seen plausible estimates for New York City as high as 8. In other places R0 might be lower than one to begin with, because people barely interact with each other in normal times. That hermit with fifty years experience social distancing? His local region’s R0 is about zilch.</span></p>
<p><span>To get intuition pumping one still needs a good ‘default’ R0 before any substantial interventions take place, so we can adjust after that for interventions and anything about a particular place that changes R0 substantially versus the default.</span></p>
<p><a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QdoCEXmZqj_4ptywXOKFe8I8rS6ijveqvdYXWT1quQI/edit#""><span>This document</span></a><span> collects, among other useful things, a bunch of estimates of R0. If you average out all numbers that don’t involve an intervention it comes to about 3.36.</span></p>
<p><span>We need to reconcile that with serial interval and doubling times. Looking at the same document for serial interval, we get a minimum of 4 days and an average of 5 days, with an upper bound around a week.</span></p>
<p><span>It now seems clear that most of even those sounding early warnings predicted doubling times far longer than those we later observed. Community spread is fast. For a while a lot of places seemed to have doubling times of 2.5 days (and New York City may plausibly have been as low as 1.3 days). If the doubling time is 2.5 days and the serial interval is 5 days then R0 should be about 4, so each serial interval can let us double twice. I have been using that as a reasonable baseline overall guess.</span></p>
<p><span>It does seem Bucky and LessWrong </span><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/KJBQ7GiyvFTBnSEEC/growth-rate-of-covid-19-outbreaks""><span>got it right on March 9</span></a><span>, which </span><i><span>would have materially impacted my life plans </span></i><span>even that late in the game</span><i><span>, </span></i><span>but I didn’t see that in time and only updated at least a week or so later. My usual sources all had 4-5 days or longer, causing me to move much too slowly.</span></p>
<h3><b>Interaction Interactions</b></h3>
<p><span>Exposures to Covid-19 outside the household and outside the medical system all seem to have sufficiently low individual probability of infection that we can add their infection probabilities together to get the expected infection count. This is a tiny error, but not enough to matter much.</span></p>
<p><span>If we presume that a typical place starts with R0=4, then we need roughly a 75% reduction in total quantity of exposures to get R0=1. It’s more complicated than that, in a bit we will beware and also embrace R0 variance, but I want to start with the simple version first.</span></p>
<p><span>How much do various interventions cut exposures? What types of exposure are cut how much?</span></p>
<p><span>Here is a practical list of ways people might be exposed:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Inside of a household or living facility.</span></li>
<li><span>Social interactions.</span></li>
<li><span>Medical system.</span></li>
<li><span>Prison, jail, other detention.</span></li>
<li><span>Courts.</span></li>
<li><span>At work indoors.</span></li>
<li><span>At work outdoors.</span></li>
<li><span>Recreational indoors out of household.</span></li>
<li><span>Recreational outdoors.</span></li>
<li><span>Errands and tasks not otherwise included in the list.</span></li>
<li><span>Commuting, especially mass transit.</span></li>
<li><span>Travel other than commuting, especially air travel, trains and so on.</span></li>
<li><span>Crowd events now gone: Stadiums, theaters, concerts, rallies, etc.</span></li>
<li><span>Crowd events mostly gone: Religious services, holidays.</span></li>
<li><span>Grocery stores from other shoppers.</span></li>
<li><span>Restaurants, including takeout, excluding from the food.</span></li>
<li><span>Packages, excluding the food itself.</span></li>
<li><span>Food, including both groceries and restaurants.</span></li>
<li><span>Delivery contact points.</span></li>
<li><span>Schools.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>What am I missing here?</span></p>
<p><span>It is easy to see that </span><i><span>most </span></i><span>of these have been squashed as vectors far more than 75%, but some of them have not been and may even have risen.</span></p>
<p><span>In particular, #1 (Inside of Household), #3 (Medical), #4 (Imprisonment), #9 (Recreational Outdoors) and #15 (Grocery Stores) are plausibly as bad or worse than their normal life baselines. I believe we have cut back on #5 (Courts) in most places but those that do remain still seem quite bad.</span></p>
<p><span>Inside of household exposure gets worse when you always stay home, which plausibly overrides any extra precautions taken. The good news is that it then gets very hard for many secondary in-household infections to spread further, as we’ll discuss later.</span></p>
<p><span>The medical system frequently lacks proper protective equipment and is not giving health care workers proper time to quarantine. These are both very bad. The horrible consolation here is that each health care worker only gets sick once, they know to be careful when not on the job, and in heavily infected areas anyone who does not think they have Covid-19 or a true emergency situation is avoiding all health care workers entirely. There might not be that many others left to infect here after a few weeks.</span></p>
<p><span>The prison systems make even ordinary-life levels of social distancing or hygiene physically impossible, so basically everyone we don’t release is probably going to get exposed. We should be releasing a lot of people but mostly aren’t, although new arrests are slowing dramatically. Prisons are presumably headed quickly to herd immunity levels, and the guards will also mostly get infected at some point. Our prison system is pretty terrible even in normal times and this is worse. The ‘good news’ again is that this vector dies out relatively quickly due to herd immunity.</span></p>
<p><span>Grocery stores are often a madhouse now, and people need more stuff from them. Delivery services are maxed out and have failed to expand that much. Here in Warwick the local ShopRite is gigantic but impossible to safely use. The website is permanently overloaded and there are never available slots even for pick-up let alone delivery. Even the aisles are more dangerous than anything else we might do, and checking out is a disaster. Long lines in places others can’t avoid. The counterargument is that before a lot of people went very often and would end up very, very close to each other, whereas now at least people are trying to not do that. Grocery delivery might both be the worst thing left for most people, and still better than it was before interventions.</span></p>
<p><span>Recreational outdoors could have gotten better or worse, since people take precautions but are also far more desperate to get outside and are crowding some areas.</span></p>
<p><span>#2 (Social Interactions), #6 (At Work Indoors), #7 (At Work Outdoors), #8 (Recreational Indoors), #10 (Errands), #12 (Travel), #13 (Stadiums), #14 (Worship), #16 (Restaurants), #19 (Delivery Contact Points) and #20 (Schools) all seem squashed reasonably well, at least 75% in most places. Some are effectively down almost 100%.</span></p>
<p><span>#11 (Commuting) is down a lot but perhaps not 75%. That could be a problem in places where commuting often involves mass transit, as riding in one’s car is not a big concern. One of New York City’s biggest problems has been that the subway, even with ridership (and in a show of true bureaucratic insanity, number of trains) down by half or more, this vector is still a gigantic problem that most other places don’t have.</span></p>
<p><span>#17 (Packages) and #18 (Food) depend on how many people are actually taking precautions on these, which is unclear. Presumably they haven’t gotten net worse overall, but it is possible. I do not think they are large contributors to the initial R0. Those being careful are 90%+ safer. Those not being careful depend on the precautions on the other end, and are getting more packages.</span></p>
<p><span>Or another list, which would be infection vectors more generally:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Direct physical contact.</span></li>
<li><span>Droplets.</span></li>
<li><span>Surfaces.</span></li>
<li><span>Fecal/oral.</span></li>
<li><span>Miasma (to extent this is a thing).</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>Direct physical contact is </span><i><span>way </span></i><span>down. Even a simple ‘do the things you’d normally do, other than those that involve a lot of direct physical contact, and try not to touch anyone while doing them’ seems like it should be good for 75%+. We’re going much farther than that.</span></p>
<p><span>Droplets are a function of social distancing and presumably follow roughly an inverse square law for each interaction because physics. People are being told to think of a Boolean at 6 feet, which is obviously wrong, but given people’s defaults their actual reactions should result in large cuts. It’s hard to think they aren’t down 75%+ even before masks. Masks then help a lot as well, and the tide is turning on wearing them. If all of that isn’t enough, it’s presumably a large underestimation of the rise in grocery store exposures, which we can and should limit with extreme prejudice as I suggest in the next section.</span></p>
<p><span>Surfaces are something people previously mostly ignored and are now trying to dodge, plus we are mostly not going outside, plus a lot of wearing gloves and washing and not touching faces, so 75%+ reduction seems clear.</span></p>
<p><span>Miasma is a function of hanging out in packed places, which has to also be down 75%+ (and may or may not be a vector at all, or one worth worrying about).</span></p>
<p><span>The only vector that isn’t obviously down at least 75% would be fecal/oral. Increased hand washing and reduced face touching seem like they’d be big games here, as would gloves worn during food preparation and doing most food preparation inside the household. Many are taking additional strong food precautions.</span></p>
<p><span>A third method is to look at interventions, and estimate how much reduction each one accomplishes.</span></p>
<p><span>How much do we get from hand washing and face avoiding? How much do we get from social distancing? Wearing masks? Working from home? Closing schools? Closing restaurants? Cancelling events? Closing stadiums and hoses of worship? And so on.</span></p>
<h3><b>Low Hanging Fruit: Safer Grocery Delivery</b></h3>
<p><span>Doing that analysis made buying groceries stick out as the biggest remaining easily avoidable obstacle, and the one place things have gotten much worse for average people.</span></p>
<p><span>For most people able to work from home, getting groceries safely is the main barrier to maintaining an effective quarantine.</span></p>
<p><span>Delivery and pick-up services exist, but they are not scaling up fast enough and are at maximum capacity. Stores are packed. It is difficult to retain the work force, let alone expand it, as things get more dangerous and stressful. When we last investigated the local ShopRite, there were only three open checkout aisles. Getting even a pickup time has become impossible. Most people cannot afford Instacart’s ~30% markup, which is the reason Instacart is still available at all, but that means it does not provide a general solution.</span></p>
<p><span>A single trip to many grocery stores, even while taking all realistic precautions and moving quickly, is likely </span><i><span>most </span></i><span>of the exposure for </span><i><span>most </span></i><span>people working from home or not working, even if you only count exposure to other shoppers. Store workers are at high risk from everyone coming in and out.</span></p>
<p><span>This is also the only major exposure that most people have that hasn’t already been cut by 75% or more. If we could knock it out, it would be a huge blow to R0. It would also be a huge safety boost to many of our most vulnerable.</span></p>
<p><span>The good news is that this problem is so big we can afford to throw massive amounts of money at it. I propose we do exactly that. There is no need to be subtle or careful, here.</span></p>
<p><span>I propose a straightforward $20/hour direct wage subsidy to all grocery store and restaurant workers whose focus is a combination of check-out, pick-up and delivery, up to 20% of the revenue from goods sold (you need </span><i><span>some </span></i><span>cap if you’re letting people hire at a good wage for free, these numbers don’t seem obviously wrong, and going for the elegance of calling this “a 20/20 vision” seemed nice).</span></p>
<p><span>In exchange, we ask only that all take-out and delivery charges must be waved – delivery has to be same cost as in-store purchase. This encourages the use of the pick-up and delivery services without concern about price. As much as I love allocation by price in most situations, we want to force massive scaling here rather than efficient allocation before scaling is finished.</span></p>
<p><span>We include existing workers to not punish anyone who scaled up early, to encourage employee retention, and because they are heroes who deserve the hazard pay. As Henry Ford and many others have shown us, if you want extraordinary effort, pay well above the ‘market wage’ and you will get rewarded. Given what all this is costing us, the cost here is chump change.</span></p>
<p><span>And also because we already wanted to throw money at people, our existing methods are taking months to work, and this seems like as good a way as any to get things going.</span></p>
<p><span>The resulting lowering (or at least, not raising) of food prices across the board then acts as a progressive subsidy to everyone, taking the same role as sending out universal checks. Competition is a thing and everyone’s gotta eat. We also create jobs.</span></p>
<p><span>That’s version one. I’m sure it can be improved, but it seems like an obviously vastly better deal than anything else on the table, and seems shovel ready.</span></p>
<p><span>(A parallel wage subsidy to health care workers on the front lines likely also makes sense for many of the same reasons, especially as hospitals depend on elective procedures to keep the lights on and are in many places cutting doctor pay, and would presumably have broad support.)</span></p>
<p><span>With that out of the way, we now return to examining R0.</span></p>
<h3><b>In-Household versus Out-of-Household</b></h3>
<p><span>In versus out of household was a key distinction</span><a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2020/04/01/taking-initial-viral-load-seriously/""> <span>when considering initial viral load</span></a><span>. It’s also a big consideration when modeling the spread of infections. This is especially true directly after instituting a lock down.</span></p>
<p><span>In-household transmissions go up rather than down when a lock down is instituted, since everyone in-household is now staying home more often, and thus interacting more often.</span></p>
<p><span>However, once you are locked down, are the resulting infections going to spread further?</span></p>
<p><span>The members of a household now have most of their interactions with each other, even more than they might have had before the lock down. Many, including most kids, will have a tiny amount of overall household exposure and an even smaller percentage of overall exposing of others to the household. If you stay home, you essentially cannot infect anyone outside the household, at all.</span></p>
<p><span>Thus, the bulk of in-household infections basically stop counting for the effective R0, because the resulting R0 for such infections is close to zero. We would be better off thinking about households as either ‘infected’ or ‘not infected’ the way we would previously have thought about individual people.</span></p>
<p><span>In turn, this means we will be doubly too pessimistic about lock down effects early on, since the ratio of in-household to out-of-household infections will spike before returning to normal levels and that is not only atypical but relatively harmless in terms of further infections.</span></p>
<h3><b>Beware R0 Variance?</b></h3>
<p><span>R0 as one number is a big simplification. R0 variance in some times and places is bad and we need to be beware. In other times and places it is helpful. Details matter a lot, as does the big picture.</span></p>
<p><span>R0 variance raises overall R0. If we have two groups are mostly distinct and only interact rarely, one with R0=0.5 and one with R0=1.5, we get most of our infections in the R0=1.5 group, and R0 ends up well above 1. Thus, if we say that R0=4 in general, we’re saying that the average across groups or regions is less than that. We are not doing good modeling if we say that R0=4 in general but with variance so R0&gt;4, although there will be scenarios where it temporarily goes over 4.</span></p>
<p><span>If our goal is to squash entirely and then reopen everything, R0 variance across places and groups naively looks quite bad. We need to squash in every group, or the high-R0 groups will reinfect the low-R0 groups where we squashed successfully. The nightmare is you get R0=0.5 in general via strong suppression measures, but with a lot of variance, and in some places it still isn’t enough or the measures weren’t adapted, and you need to stay shut down or it all comes back.</span></p>
<p><span>In other situations, the variance works in our favor.</span></p>
<p><span>If we can properly target our interventions to particular groups, places and events, R0 variance is great. R0 is gigantic in sports stadiums so we shut down the sports stadiums. If R0 was huge in New York City but under 1 in the rest of the country, we could close the bridges except to haul in supplies, and let 97% of our people carry on largely as normal. Wuhan being compact was great for China. National borders are a thing and can be enforced, and so on.</span></p>
<p><span>If we are willing and able to let things burn out to herd immunity in some places or among some groups, similar things happen. As an alternative to shutting New York City down indefinitely, we could simply declare defeat there, and allow New York City to lock down its most vulnerable as completely as possible while rapidly getting to herd immunity, while not following that strategy elsewhere. Then New York City is no longer a threat.</span></p>
<p><span>What is happening inside New York City likely looks a lot like that strategy, except for a subgroup rather than the whole area.</span></p>
<h3><b>A Very Simple Model of New York City</b></h3>
<p><span>Some New Yorkers were able and willing to self-isolate, or even to flee the city entirely. Others were not.</span></p>
<p><span>There is a continuum between my parents, who are literally only opening the door to take in packages that they then sanitize, and those who have no choice but to ride packed subways every day to make ends meet, or are so young and selfish as to be indifferent to what happens.</span></p>
<p><span>Let’s simplify that a ton, and say that some people ride the subway and some don’t.</span></p>
<p><span>The people in the subway are packed tight, because the MTA cut the number of trains in proportion to the cut in ridership. Those still in the subway have several times the exposure to people that others have, and those exposures are to other strangers who ride the subway.</span></p>
<p><span>Among those who ride the subway a lot, infection rates get out of control very quickly. We should expect by now that those still riding the subways daily have essentially all been exposed enough at least a week ago to get infected if they aren’t somehow naturally immune – look at the admitted-to-be-undercounted death rates, assume those people were infected three weeks prior, look at the doubling rates during those times, and snowball the effects. There’s no need to do any math here.</span></p>
<p><span>By the end of April and quite possibly the end of March, the subway group is mostly immune, and has blown past steady state herd immunity levels even with its high levels of exposure. The city then has R0 levels that are even lower than if the subway was taken entirely out of play, since those people also interact elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span>It’s definitely not the solution we would want! It’s a ton of infections. Also deaths. Still a lot less infections and deaths than doing the same to the whole city, which will now have a much easier time squashing than if everyone in the population was identical. It also means we can now use the subways to get essential workers where they need to get, without making the forward-looking problem worse.</span></p>
<h3><b>Actual Exposure Inequality</b></h3>
<p><span>I consider the above scenario a </span><i><span>relatively equal </span></i><span>distribution of exposures, compared to the real situation.</span></p>
<p><span>Even in normal times, different people have radically different levels of exposure to crowds, to being physically close to others, to interacting with different as opposed to the same people repeatedly. Different people have radically different levels of caution and hygiene.</span></p>
<p><span>People have speculated about ‘super spreaders’ who are much more infectious than others, and who might account for the bulk of out-of-household infections. That might or might not be a thing. What is definitely a thing is that some people are in position to create additional orders of magnitude more exposure in others, especially others that are socially disjoint from them, than most people are in position to create.</span></p>
<p><span>The people who are in position to infect lots of others are, mostly, also the people in position to be infected by many others in the first place. If you are the pastor and shake hands with your whole congregation each week under normal circumstances, you might both have 100 times as much exposure to catching the virus, and 100 times as many places to spread the virus.</span></p>
<p><span>Both directions follow a power law, and both directions are highly correlated.</span></p>
<p><span>Thus, the idea that to get R0 from 4 to 1 via herd immunity requires 75% immunity rates </span><i><span>doesn’t make even a little bit of sense</span></i><span> to me. People won’t be infected at random. And yet this is the standard calculation used everywhere I look.</span></p>
<p><span>One follow-up question is, are those who have more exposure more commonly linked up with each other than with others?</span></p>
<p><span>In some cases, clearly yes. The subway is a clean example of those at risk mostly exposing each other. So are all the young men who continued not social distancing after they were ordered to distance. They mostly hung around each other. The reason Florida’s spring break was likely to bad was because those there were engaging in </span><i><span>unusual-for-them </span></i><span>behavior, and would later go back to other places and act normally. Under normal circumstances, if the beach or park is packed, then the group of people willing to go there will put each other at great risk but may not put others at such high risk. This gets us a lot of effective immunity at low cost.</span></p>
<p><span>Consider how we got to R0=4. If one third of the people interact twice as much as everyone else, in both directions, and all interactions are random, than at the start they constitute half of all infections. Thus, we start out at R0=2.67 for infections in the bigger group. If the third who interact more was immune, that’s half of possible infections, so that goes to R0=1.33, so you only need a quarter of the less interactive group immune to get R0=1 with a 50% infection rate rather than 75%. You can’t get that whole win since you wouldn’t actually infect the whole more-interaction group that fast, but you could certainly get half this effect and get down around 62%.</span></p>
<p><span>The real ratios are </span><i><span>much bigger </span></i><span>than that. It doesn’t take that much of this effect to get R0=1 in the bulk of the population even before anyone is immune or does any social distancing.</span></p>
<p><span>If I had to guess what percentage of people we would need to </span><i><span>naturally </span></i><span>infect (rather than selecting them on purpose) to get herd immunity with no behavioral alterations? I would guess something like 35%, rather than 75%. And I’d expect that the first 3% infected, which I am guessing is about where the United States is right now, would get us </span><i><span>far more than 10% </span></i><span>of the effect of 35%. </span></p>
<p><span>That’s without us doing deliberate infection or antibody testing in any intelligent way. We can do even better if we can create and/or identify immune citizens and put them in positions of high two-way exposure. Unless we completely drop the ball (which would fit our existing patterns so far) we should start to see substantial gains from antibody testing by the end of April.</span></p>
<p><span>Thus, I’ve become more of an optimist going forward. Variance makes the problem anti-inductive in the sense that the virus will thrive wherever conditions are best, but friendly longer term once containment fails anyway, because it separates out problems that solve themselves relatively quickly at lower cost.</span></p>
<p><span>I expect that the way we get out of this is a combination of herd immunity coming on stronger and faster than we expect, combined with the cumulative effects of various interventions, many of which can be maintained in a “Phase II” style world without that high a cost, mostly via voluntary action. We can continue to not shake hands and wear masks and avoid large gatherings and have a third of people work from home and so on at a relatively tiny cost. Then we combine that with test and trace, which helps even if it isn’t ubiquitous, and we can have an acceptable situation while we await a vaccine.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Postscript on Recent Data</strong></h3>
<p><span>Since I started writing this several days ago, the official numbers have improved considerably in America and abroad. New infections are leveling off, test positive rates are down, and deaths are no longer growing exponentially. This is faster than even my at-the-time prediction that new infections (rather than new detected infections) peaked specifically in New York City on April 1, and the stock market has rallied accordingly. </span></p>
<p><span>I do think we should be deeply skeptical of these numbers. New York’s numbers especially seem to mostly reflect hitting maximum hospital capacity and maximum testing capacity, both of which are mostly static. We only count deaths if they involve positive tests and in practice in New York that means hospitalization. So when we see deaths leveling off faster than would make sense given how deaths lag, we likely shouldn’t interpret even deaths as meaning much more than ‘the numbers are higher than this but we have no idea how much higher.’ With even deaths clearly undercounted, calculations that start with official death counts, without adjustments, are going to be underestimates. </span></p>
<p><span>The percentage of tests that are positive is probably the best data we have, but even that seems to be strangely noisy. American positive test rates were in the 23%-26% range for four days, then dropped to 15% before increasing back to 19% for 4/5 and 4/6. This is even more stark if you exclude the epicenter in New York and New Jersey (where positive rates have been between 46% and 51% with 20k-31k daily tests each day since 3/30), with the rest of the country having four days from 15.7%-18.3% positive rates, then three days from 9.5%-12.9% (all data from </span><a href=""https://covidtracking.com/data""><span>the Covid tracking project</span></a><span>). That has to reflect strange distributions in reported tests and/or incorrect data. So it’s all full of noise, and probably stays that way until we get antibody tests. Hopefully we get better data soon. </span></p>

However, my emphasis is on certain features of this view:</p><ul><li>There is some &quot;basic stuff&quot; -- like like quarks or vibrating strings or what-have-you.</li><li>What there is to know about the world is some set of statements about this basic stuff -- particle locations and momentums, or wave-form function values, or what-have-you. </li><li>These special atomic statements should be logically independent from each other (though they may of course be probabilistically related), and together, fully determine the world.</li><li>These should (more or less) be what beliefs are about, such that we can (more or less) talk about beliefs in terms of the sample space <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\omega \in \Omega""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">&#x3C9;</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">&#x2208;</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">&#x3A9;</span></span></span></span></span></span> as being the set of worlds understood in this way.</li></ul><p>This is the so-called &quot;view from nowhere&quot;, as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_View_from_Nowhere"">Thomas Nagel puts it</a>.</p><p>I don&apos;t intend to construe this position as ruling out certain non-physical facts which we may have beliefs about. For example, we may believe <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/SFLCB5BgjzruJv9sp/logical-and-indexical-uncertainty"">indexical</a> facts on top of the physical facts -- there might be (1) beliefs about the universe, and (2) <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ethRJh2E7mSSjzCay/building-phenomenological-bridges"">beliefs about where we are in the universe</a>. Exceptions like this <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/my5pbcmQPb6ASSHYM/puzzles-for-physicalists"">violate an extreme reductive view</a>, but are still close enough to count as reductive thinking for my purposes.</p><h2>Utility Is a Function of Worlds</h2><p>So we&apos;ve got the &quot;basically physical&quot; <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\omega \in \Omega""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">&#x3C9;</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">&#x2208;</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">&#x3A9;</span></span></span></span></span></span>.

In other words, utility is a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_variable"">random variable</a> on our event space.</p><p>What&apos;s the big deal?</p><p>One thing this is saying is that <em>preferences are a function of the world</em>. Specifically, <em>preferences need not only depend on what is observed.</em> This is <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/aAzApjEpdYwAxnsAS/reinforcement-learning-with-imperceptible-rewards"">incompatible with standard RL in a way that matters</a>. </p><p>But, in addition to saying that utility can depend on more than just observations, we are <em>restricting</em> utility to <em>only</em> depend on things that are in the world.

If there are such moral facts, they have to be present somewhere in the universe (at least, derivable from facts about the universe).</p><p>One implication of this: <em>if utility is about high-level entities, the utility function is responsible for deriving them from low-level stuff.</em> For example, if the universe is made of quarks, but utility is a function of beauty, consciousness, and such, then <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""U()""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em;

Your task is to push a button. You get 10 utility for pushing the button. You can push it any time you like. However, if you never press the button, you get -10. On any day, you are fine with putting the button-pressing off for one more day. Yet, if you put it off forever, you lose!</p><p>We can think of <span><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\omega""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">&#x3C9;</span></span></span></span></span></span> as a string like 000000100.., where the &quot;1&quot; is the day you push the button. To compute the utility, we might look for the &quot;1&quot;, outputting 10 if we find it.</p><p>But what about the all-zero universe, 0000000...? The program must loop forever. We can&apos;t tell we&apos;re in the all-zero universe by examining any finite number of bits. You don&apos;t know whether you will eventually push the button. (Even if the universe also gives your source code, you can&apos;t necessarily tell from that -- the logical difficulty of determining this about yourself is, of course, the original point of the procrastination paradox.)</p><p>Hence, a preference structure like this is not computable, and is not allowed according to the reductive utility doctrine.</p><p>The advocate of reductive utility might take this as a victory. The procrastination paradox has been avoided, and other paradoxes with a similar structure. (The <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/paradox-stpetersburg/"">St. Petersburg Paradox</a> is another example.)</p><p>On the other hand, if you think this is a <em>legitimate preference structure</em>, dealing with such &apos;problematic&apos; preferences motivates abandonment of reductive utility.</p><h1>Subjective Utility: The Real Thing</h1><p>We can strongly oppose all three points without leaving orthodox Bayesianism. Specifically, I&apos;ll sketch how the <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/decision-theory/#JefThe"">Jeffrey-Bolker axioms</a> enable non-reductive utility. (The title of this section is a reference to Jeffrey&apos;s book <em>Subjective Probability: The Real Thing.</em>)</p><p>However, the <em>real</em> position I&apos;m advocating is more grounded in logical induction rather than the Jeffrey-Bolker axioms; I&apos;ll sketch that version at the end.</p><h2>The View From Somewhere</h2><p>The reductive-utility view approached things from the starting-point of the universe. Beliefs are for what is real, and what is real is basically physical.</p><p>The non-reductive view starts from the standpoint of the agent. Beliefs are <em>for things you can think about</em>. This doesn&apos;t rule out a physicalist approach. What it <em>does</em> do is give high-level objects like tables and chairs an equal footing with low-level objects like quarks: both are inferred from sensory experience by the agent.</p><p>Rather than assuming an underlying set of <em>worlds</em>, Jeffrey-Bolker assume only a set of events.

However, unlike in the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_axioms"">Kolmogorov axioms</a>, these are not assumed to be intersection, union, and complement of an underlying set of worlds.</p><p>Let me emphasize that: <em>we need not assume there are &quot;worlds&quot; at all.</em></p><p>In philosophy, this is called <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/situations-semantics/"">situation semantics</a> -- an alternative to the more common <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/possible-worlds/"">possible-world semantics</a>. In mathematics, it brings to mind <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointless_topology"">pointless topology</a>.</p><p>In the Jeffrey-Bolker treatment, a world is just a maximally specific event: an event which describes everything completely. But there is no requirement that maximally-specific events exist. Perhaps any event, no matter how detailed, can be further extended by specifying some yet-unmentioned stuff. (Indeed, the Jeffrey-Bolker axioms assume this!

I hope to get more technical in a later post. For now, here&apos;s some bullet points:</p><ul><li>In the simple procrastination-paradox example, you push the button if you have any uncertainty at all. So things are not that interesting. But, at least we&apos;ve solved the problem.</li><li>In more complicated examples -- where there is some real benefit to procrastinating -- a LI-based agent could totally procrastinate forever. This is because LI doesn&apos;t give any guarantee about converging to correct beliefs for uncomputable propositions like whether Turing machines halt or whether people stop procrastinating.</li><li>Believing you&apos;ll stop procrastinating even though you won&apos;t is <em>perfectly coherent</em> -- in the same way that believing in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-standard_model_of_arithmetic"">nonstandard numbers</a> is perfectly logically consistent. Putting ourselves in the shoes of such an agent, this just means we&apos;ve examined our own decision-making to the best of our ability, and have put significant probability on &quot;we don&apos;t procrastinate forever&quot;. This kind of reasoning is necessarily fallible.</li><li>Yet, if a system we built were to do this, we might have strong objections. So, this can count as an alignment problem. How can we give feedback to a system to avoid this kind of mistake? I hope to work on this question in future posts.</li></ul>",abramdemski,abramdemski,abramdemski,

Despite our current focus, influenza also remains a serious disease, so understanding its risk factors is also important.</p><p>Here, I&#x2019;ll look at some of the evidence on how body mass&#xA0;&#x2014; formalized as Body Mass Index (BMI, weight in kilograms divided by squared height in metres) &#x2014; influences prognosis for respiratory diseases. Information specific to COVID-19 is still scant, but there is more data on influenza and on other respiratory infections (which includes coronaviruses other than COVID-19). Information on how BMI relates to general mortality should also be helpful.</p><p>Below, I&#x2019;ll look at two relevant papers, plus a preliminary report on COVID-19. To preview my conclusions, it seems that being underweight and being seriously obese are both risk factors for serious respiratory illness.

I remember when </span>

<a href=""https://mosh.org/"">mosh</a> first came out
and thinking ""that sounds like a great idea, maybe I'll set it up
sometime"" and then never getting around to it.  Several times over the
years I've thought similarly, but it never seemed worth it.  A week
ago a coworker asked if there were good tools for handling remote
terminal use over laggy internet connections, and I suggested mosh.
They really liked it, which then had me feeling silly for never trying
it, and got me to actually do it.  So: I'm typing this over mosh, and
it's excellent!  I should have done this years ago.



</p><p>

With a traditional remote shell like ssh you are sending characters
back and forth and the state of your terminal is maintained
client-side.  This means that when you press a 'q' you don't see it
appear on the screen until a message has gone to the server saying
""they pressed 'q'"" and a response comes back saying ""ok, put a 'q' on
the screen"".  If you have a nice fast connection this happens so
quickly you can't even tell, but if you're on flaky wifi it can be
very painful.

</p>

<p>

Mosh turns this around, maintains the terminal on the server, and
syncs the state of the terminal from the server to the client as
efficiently as it can.  Additionally, it echos your typing back as you
go, and then overwrites it with the state from the server once it gets
it.  It even handles cases where you're typing text into the middle of
an existing line, sliding the rest of the line forwards to make room.
It shows locally echoed text with a little underline so you know it's
just a prediction.

</p>

<p>

Working from my <a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/making-a-standing-desk"">third floor
bedroom</a> connected to wifi in the basement, in a house with seven
other people who might all be streaming video at once, with a workflow
that is built entirely around being ssh'd into a remote server, this
is just amazing.

</p>

<p>

It's funny looking back at the world before, and seeing people being
dismissive of these ideas.  For example, about six months before mosh
came out someone <a href=""https://serverfault.com/questions/302505/is-there-a-way-to-avoid-ssh-typing-delay%22"">asked
on StackOverflow</a> how to avoid the typing delay on SSH.  The
accepted answer is saying this is impossible and just suggesting that
people type without seeing feedback (this probably works a lot better
for people who are more accurate typists than I am).  Similarly, the
<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3819382"">HackerNews
discussion</a> has several people saying that you can patch something
similar together with existing tools.

</p>

<p>

This does leave me wondering whether mosh could make better
predictions.  When I hold down the up arrow, it only slowly moves my
cursor from line to line, waiting for server round trips.  Since mosh
has my whole terminal state, it can probably figure out that I'm
typing this in emacs from the minibuffer and how previous arrow keys
and emacs keybindings were handled.  It would be really neat if it
could then use those predictions to let me navigate vertically as
easily as horizontally.  Similarly, when I type Alt-X emacs moves me
to the minibuffer: after seeing a few rounds of this it seems like a
fancy prediction system for mosh could do this as well?  You would
need to be careful about not echoing passwords, but I think that's
still doable?  I'm curious whether anyone has explored this direction,
though for now I'm really very happy with its current abilities.

I have performed the first test, based on the 2009 H1N1/swine flu pandemic. The stock market did not crash, and in my analysis the alarm bell did not ring - but see the comments for caveats.</p><p>This is because 2009 H1N1 was much less deadly than COVID-19, and it also did not shut down the world economy. The &quot;alarm bell&quot; rings if 13 of the 16 below criteria are operative, but only 11 of the 16 criteria were ever met.</p><p>This is one point of evidence in favor of this alarm bell being correctly calibrated. I would also like to investigate this question for Ebola, MERS, SARS, HIV/AIDS, the 1968 Hong Kong flu, and (as far as it&apos;s relevant) the 1918 Spanish flu.</p><p><strong>Stock Market Trends in 2009</strong></p><p>The stock market was at a low point in 2009 around March 6th, but had begun a strong upward trend that would last the rest of the year by mid-March, when the first cases of swine flu were confirmed in Mexico. Although the New York Times reported <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/28/business/28markets.html"">stock market tremors</a> related to swine flu on April 27th, 2009, looking at the data for the whole year, the daily fluctuations for the year look pretty much like a random walk (April 27th highlighted in red):</p><span><figure><img src=""https://i.imgur.com/DDBkBDg.png"" class=""draft-image "" style=""width:100%""></figure></span><p><strong>Factor 1: Transmissibility</strong></p><ul><li><em>Does the disease appear to spread from human to human?</em></li></ul><p>Yes, as with all H1N1 flu.</p><ul><li><em>Does the disease spread via indirect contact (coughing, sneezing)?</em></li></ul><p>Yes, as with all H1N1 flu.</p><ul><li><em>Is there any evidence that the disease is transmissible before or just after the start of symptoms?</em></li></ul><p>Yes.

So I will consider adding a global, non-age-based CFR threshold to the criteria.</p><p>This project is also not about estimating the true value of CFR; it&apos;s about normalizing a heuristic for deciding when to behave as if a new illness could be as serious as COVID-19.</p><p>So we have to ask what our threshold for evidence is.

But, I like it, and I liked exploring it. Also, I derived it from cognitive science, which is a thing a lot of people seem to think is never practical, so there.</p><p>Anyways, here&apos;s</p><h2>The pitch.</h2><p>Everyone knows the power of priming. Even though all the stupid versions of the experiments failed to replicate, the basic ones did. And even if the basic ones didn&apos;t, you&apos;d know they were designed wrong, because everyone&apos;s had the experience of e.g. talking about fetch while tossing a ball and then trying to yell &quot;catch&quot; to your friend and saying &quot;fetch&quot; instead.</p><p>But this is low-level priming. There&apos;s also high-level priming: if you take two gamers and have them talk about the stock market, but one of them hasn&apos;t played games in weeks and the other just finished a wild round of Dota, all else being equal the one who was just playing will be much more likely to introduce a gaming metaphor first.</p><p>For the more important application of it, the <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20141117075805/https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/"">old version of Meditations on Moloch</a> said it well:</p><blockquote>Chronology is a harsh master. You read three totally unrelated things at the same time and they start seeming like obviously connected blind-man-and-elephant style groping at different aspects of the same fiendishly-hard-to-express point.</blockquote><p>You can obviously prime yourself a ton by what you read. But this isn&apos;t super useful on its own. At least, I don&apos;t immediately know what I would prime myself for. </p><p>But another point. Creative people are always traveling and seeking out novelty, because travel just causes your brain to invariably begin erupting with ideas. On the opposite end, consider when you are (for an unlikely example) in lockdown in your house seeing the same 3 rooms over and over again for weeks. Your flow of ideas ceases, when you hear a new thing your brain reaches nowhere for a similarity, and you become catatonic.</p><p>(This quarantine isn&apos;t where the technique originated, but it sure is its wheelhouse.)</p><h2>The technique</h2><p>is to then prime yourself with the densest analogy-fodder available, so you can effortlessly have lots of thoughts later. Maybe you choose the following regimen for day 1:</p><ul><li>3-minute video of a lightsaber duel</li><li>3 minutes writing down your basic model of the stock market</li><li>5 minutes deciding your favorite plant</li><li>5 minutes reading a poem by CS Lewis</li></ul><p>It took you 20 minutes, but after this you&apos;re primed for analogies on any topic that your subconscious can easily relate to lightsabers, stocks, dope plants, or CS Lewis poems, which is all of them, because I chose a covering set. </p><p>There&apos;s a way to do it wrong, which is by choosing things that are interesting but don&apos;t actually interest you. (These 4 highly interest me, but probably won&apos;t immediately light you up.) Obviously priming doesn&apos;t work well if you promptly forget about the things you looked at. You need your subconscious dwelling on them. This is not the same as your conscious wanting your subconscious to dwell on them.</p><p>But if you do it right, this is a definite positive of the technique: it&apos;s just looking at stuff you like, so it should be energy-positive, which is more than most self-help hacks can say. </p><h2>Variants:</h2><p>First, you can just try varying the types of thing you prime yourself with. You can really prime with a lot of options, and I&apos;ve learned a lot from exploring.</p><p>But for actual variants. </p><p><strong>Targeted priming.</strong> Need to be creative about plants? Need to more adroitly navigate your confidence issues when planting? Want to hook in more of your current ideas about plants to your training in physics? Skip priming so many things, and just choose some video where someone navigates a confidence crisis or whatever. Let your brain churn on it. </p><p><strong>Sleep priming.</strong> Do your self-priming just before you sleep instead of just before you do other stuff. Sometimes after a boring day my brain has very little of interest to chew on at night, nor does it want rest and get very rejuvenated, it&apos;s just in a very lame place. Priming helps you remember it doesn&apos;t have to be that way. Just <em>please</em> don&apos;t overuse this and ruin the last vestige of time when your subconscious can work on the <em>actually important stuff</em> without your consciousness hijacking things for its own purposes. I feel a little bad for even mentioning this one. Also be careful not to get caught up in the thoughts and balloon your sleep latency, that&apos;s why I stopped after ~two attempts with this sort of thing and now prime sleep in better ways.</p><p><strong>Long-term priming.</strong> Maybe you had a really good framework a while ago that you realize you haven&apos;t used much lately, and you&apos;re worried you lost some of the good parts and didn&apos;t strictly dominate it with better understanding. Maybe you want to think a little more like an economist, or a little more like your friend Andy, and you don&apos;t have a great way to do that deliberately. Just prime a bit by skimming an economics paper and trying to get the gist, or just replay some classic Andy moments in your head. If there&apos;s good stuff, your subconscious can grab it and build a gradient; if not, nothing. This one is actually quite safe I think: if your subconscious doesn&apos;t see much useful there, you&apos;ll get bored and won&apos;t pollute yourself.</p>",Connor_Flexman,connor_flexman,Connor_Flexman,

Scale back moral condemnation and guilt. LessWrong types can be powerful allies, but the way to get them on board is to give them opportunities to feel like munchkins with rare secret insights, not like latecomers to a not-particularly-fun party who have to play catch-up to avoid getting yelled at. It&#x2019;s fine to frame helping animals as&#xA0;<em>challenging</em>, but the challenge should be to excel and do something astonishing, not to meet a bare standard for decency.</blockquote><p>That shouldn&apos;t have had different effects on me than other essays, but damned if it didn&apos;t.</p><hr class=""dividerBlock""><p>Consider a utilitarian Ursula with a utility function U. U is defined over all possible ways the world could be, and for each of those ways it gives you a number.

If a utilitarian Vader with utility function V is facing the same choice (in another universe) as Ursula, then because that +1 applies to <em>every</em> option equally, the right choice for Vader is the same as the right choice for Ursula. The constant difference between U and V doesn&apos;t matter for any decision whatsoever!</p><p>We represent this by saying that a utility function is only defined up to positive affine transformations.

The book club will meet weekly, and every week I&#x2019;ll write up a summary of the conversation and my follow up thoughts. I have a lot of thoughts about consciousness &#x2014; this post has over 10% of the word count of the book chapters it covers.</p><p>This is not intended to be a review of the book but more of a reading companion &#x2014; if you can&#x2019;t join our book club live you can follow along or read this whenever you read the book.</p><p>I&#x2019;m not going to track who came up with each thought below on the book club calls. Everything below is the result of a collective effort, and I&#x2019;m grateful to all the participants.</p><h2>Introduction: The Problem of Consciousness</h2><p>Jaynes goes over the history of failed scientific conceptions of consciousness in a series of somewhat vignettes on views from Associationism to Skinnerian Behaviorism. There&#x2019;s a strong whiff of straw about this section, but it&#x2019;s an important reminder that for most of its modern history academic psychology refused to take the study of consciousness seriously. Christof Koch writes <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13557108-consciousness"">in his own book on the topic</a> that&#xA0;<em>&#x201C;in the late 1980s, writing about consciousness was taken as a sign of cognitive decline.&#x201D;</em> I think that one of Jaynes&#x2019; historic contributions is mainstreaming consciousness as a topic of interest for both science and pop-science. <em>The Origin</em>, published in 1976, may have paved the way for the work of Koch, Dennett, Sachs, et al.</p><hr class=""dividerBlock""><p>In a premonition for the rest of the book, the historic review notes how every age used metaphors from whichever science was&#xA0;prominent at the time to refer to consciousness. To the ancient Greeks, it was an open space like the sea. When geology was popular consciousness was a structure of hidden layers, and in the steam age it was &#x201C;a boiler of straining energy&#x201D;.</p><p>A survey of the book club revealed the without exception, the prevailing metaphor today is the brain as a computer. While this metaphor surely introduces its own biases, at least the world of computing is rich enough to provide variety: algorithms, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_workspace_theory"">global workspace theory</a>, CPU allocation, input/output, etc.</p><hr class=""dividerBlock""><p>Speaking of bias, it&#x2019;s notable that Jaynes&#x2019; first scientific foray into consciousness research was trying to demonstrate consciousness-as-learning in mimosa plants and protozoa. Three decades after his failure to demonstrate that consciousness extends even to plants, Jaynes is arguing for a maximally opposed view, denying consciousness not just to all animals but also to Homer.</p><p>What bias do I bring to the topic? Perhaps my main one is a Rationalist&#x2019;s faith in <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/p3TndjYbdYaiWwm9x"">reductionism</a> and a failure to be moved by the hardness of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_problem_of_consciousness"">Hard Problem of Consciousness</a>. I&#x2019;m not sure how David Chalmers, having agreed that all ontologies are fake, can claim that no scientific discovery or conceptual advance could ever bridge the gap in understanding consciousness. My instinct is to follow the discoveries and the concepts; I bet that as they accumulate we will find the mysteriousness of consciousness dissolved just as the mysteriousness of light, life, etc has gone before.</p><h2>Chapter 1: The Consciousness of Consciousness</h2><p>Is Jaynes the worst ever at naming books and chapters? I&#x2019;m getting tired of typing out the word, and he wrote the book&#xA0;<em>in pencil</em>.</p><hr class=""dividerBlock""><p>Throughout this chapter, I felt that Jaynes is pulling a fast one on the readers. He demonstrates the irrelevance of consciousness to tasks like judging which hand holds a heavier weight by asking if you remember making the determination consciously. But this is asking two things of your consciousness: to judge, and also to remember judging. Those are different tasks! Blackout drunk people presumably have subjective experience in the moment, even though their hungover consciousness can&#x2019;t recall which of the poor judgments made the night before it contributed to.</p><p>The experiencing self is not the remembering self. <a href=""https://lindagraham-mft.net/the-experiencing-self-vs-the-remembering-self/"">They&#x2019;re barely even friends</a>.</p><hr class=""dividerBlock""><p>Jaynes makes the case, which informed introspection confirms, that consciousness is not on 100% of the time, and it&#x2019;s not doing 100% of the work. But &#x201C;not 100%&#x201D; doesn&#x2019;t mean zero, and it&#x2019;s very hard to tell where the truth lies in between the two.</p><p>The book club estimated being conscious between 0-30% of the time while doing zone-out tasks like driving, and 60-90% for engaging tasks. But even while driving a familiar road one is conscious of <em>some</em> things, once in a while, like a memory triggered by the song on the radio. If consciousness &#x201C;checked-in&#x201D; for a brief moment every few seconds, would we even notice or remember?</p><hr class=""dividerBlock""><p>We&#x2019;ve known for a long time that tasks requiring precise body movements like playing tennis or the piano are performed best when one thinks about their movement the least. Jaynes draws the causal arrow in the intuitive direction: lack of awareness -&gt; good performance. But what if it&#x2019;s the other way around?</p><p>Predictive processing tells us that the only information actually propagated through our neurons bottom-up is prediction <em>error</em>. When a musician sits down to play a piano piece he knows exactly how it should sound, and so would only snap into awareness if he&#xA0;<em>misses</em> a note. Poor performance -&gt; conscious awareness, and once awareness is turned on it can reflect and fix the situation.</p><p>Why would consciousness inhibit the performance of tasks like tennis or piano? Here&#x2019;s my half-baked hypothesis.</p><p>A large role of consciousness, and a possible reason for its evolution, may be the allocation System 2-type thinking to various tasks. System 2 thinking is detail-oriented, serial, demanding of working memory, and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow"">slow</a>. It&#x2019;s very resource-intensive, and so our brains generally prefer not to do it. Once in a while, some stimulus or subconscious process generates enough energy to reach conscious awareness, which can then allocate some <a href=""https://putanumonit.com/2019/05/07/thinking-fast-and-hard/"">hard thinking</a> to deal with the issue at hand. System 2 is also the only one that can do <a href=""https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/fluid-intelligence-as-cognitive-decoupling/33732803750ECADACF43F04C074C27E0"">cognitive decoupling</a>: imagine logical counterfactuals abstracted from their current context.</p><p>But System 2 is way too slow to figure out where your left finger should go in the middle of playing an allegro passage. Anyone can play a concerto at a tempo of one note every 3 seconds. What makes a physical skill impressive is the speed of precise movement, and speed requires training your System(s) 1.</p><p>I probably like this hypothesis more than most because I feel like I came up with it independently, so take it with a grain of salt. This theory also implies a pretty restricted domain of consciousness: ancient Greeks had it, but most animals don&#x2019;t since they don&#x2019;t demonstrate anything that looks like System 2 thinking.</p><hr class=""dividerBlock""><p>The section titled&#xA0;<em>Consciousness Not a Copy of Experience</em> is ironic because my own experience is nothing at all like a copy of Jaynes&#x2019;.</p><blockquote>Consider the following problems: Does the door of your room open from the right or the left? Which is your second longest finger? At a stoplight, is it the red or the green that is on top? How many teeth do you see when brushing your teeth? What letters are associated with what numbers on a telephone dial? [&#x2026;]<br>I think you will be surprised how little you can retrospect in consciousness on the supposed images you have stored from so much previous attentive experience.</blockquote><p>I had absolutely no problem answering any of the questions above and I&#x2019;m not a particularly observant person, as my wife can attest to her frustration.</p><blockquote>Think, if you will, of when you entered the room you are now in. Are the images of which you have copies the actual sensory fields? Don&#x2019;t you have an image of yourself coming through one of the doors, perhaps even a bird&#x2019;s-eye view of one of the entrances?</blockquote><p>No. No, I fucking don&#x2019;t. What kind of sick pervert &#x201C;remembers&#x201D; themselves from a third-person view? I&#x2019;ve seen hundreds of minutes of myself on camera, played hundreds of hours of <a href=""https://putanumonit.com/2019/11/27/the-player-character/"">third-person video games</a>, and yet my memories are all very much in the first-person.</p><span><figure><img src=""https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/side-view.png"" class=""draft-image "" style=""width:88%""></figure></span><p>Ok, it turns out that roughly a quarter of all people are third-person perverts. I wonder how aware Jaynes was that the flavor of his subjective experience is far from universal and that <a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/03/17/what-universal-human-experiences-are-you-missing-without-realizing-it/"">some universal experiences he may be completely missing out on</a>. I should keep this in mind for the rest of the book.</p><hr class=""dividerBlock""><p>This section is arguing against a strawman version of consciousness-as-tape-recorder. We know that memory is imperfect, changes over time, and gets mixed up with confabulations. It also has a lot of gaps by necessity, remembering only bits and pieces of your moment-to-moment sensory experience. And what if I remembered something I imagined or hallucinated, is that a &#x201C;real&#x201D; memory or a false one?</p><p>But since a lot of Jaynes&#x2019; arguments in this chapter rely on a lack of memory to disprove the role of consciousness, the fallibility of memory weakens those arguments rather than enhance them.</p><h2>Chapter 2: Consciousness</h2><p>This chapter sketches out an argument in three parts:</p><ol><li>All language is based on metaphor, on analogizing something new to something familiar based on similarities. Metaphor is not only the main way we communicate, it is the main way we understand reality.</li><li>Consciousness is a metaphor-based analog of the real world, a space where we can play out mental actions that correspond to behavior in reality.</li><li>1+2 = Consciousness is based on language, and it must have come after language.</li></ol><p>Let&#x2019;s address these in turn.</p><h4>Language</h4><p>I found the idea of language being based on metaphors very compelling. The foundational blocks of today&#x2019;s languages come from ancient metaphors (&#x201C;to be&#x201D; comes from the Sanskrit &#x201C;bhu&#x201D; which means &#x201C;to grow&#x201D;), and almost all the new concepts our language accrues are metaphors (&#x201C;coronavirus&#x201D; means &#x201C;the thing that is <a href=""https://www.etymonline.com/word/virus"">like poison</a> surrounded by spikes like a crown&#x201D;).</p><p>But if you use &#x201C;metaphor&#x201D; itself as a metaphor and stretch it to include all kinds of understanding-by-analogy, it becomes obvious that metaphor is not limited to language. You can think of visual metaphors, a caveman drawing a bat as a mouse with wings applies the same metaphor as a modern German calling it&#xA0;<em>fledermaus</em>. Even a simple gesture like showing your palms to defuse conflict is a metaphor for a situation where your hands could&#x2019;ve held a rock.</p><p>What separates language from other systems of metaphors? The two relevant differences I can think of are:</p><ul><li>Language is used to communicate with other people, not just to organize things in your own mind. Why would this make it the key to consciousness? Well, we know that a lot of simple associative learning and reasoning-by-similarity happens unconsciously based on repeated experience. But another person can&#x2019;t transmit direct experience, only words. And to infer from those someone else&#x2019;s experience that is novel to you personally, that requires consciousness.</li><li>Unlike a picture or a gesture, language uses pure symbols (words) that have no inherent connection to their referent. This is what allows language to evolve and grow in complexity. Perhaps this is the step that requires consciousness &#x2014; linking observable objects to purely mental constructs.</li></ul><h4>Analogs</h4><p>Jaynes explains the difference between a <em>model&#xA0;</em>(like Bohr&#x2019;s solar system-like atom, where no particular electron corresponds to a particular planet) and an <em>analog&#xA0;</em>(like a map, where every region corresponds to a particular plot of land). He writes that consciousness is an analog of the real world, not a model. Some people use the metaphor of&#xA0;<a href=""https://putanumonit.com/2018/09/23/territory-and-the-maps/"">the map and the territory</a> to say &#x201C;map&#x201D; when they mean &#x201C;model&#x201D;, but I think the distinction is important.</p><p><em>Models</em> can clearly live in your subconscious, but how about <em>analogs</em>? Think of mimicking the motions of a humanoid cartoon character on TV. You can do so automatically, with your sub-conscious brain holding an analog between your body parts and the shapes created by pixels on a screen.</p><p>But the main argument presented isn&#x2019;t that all mental analogs are conscious, but that consciousness is an analog of reality. In Jaynes&#x2019; words:</p><blockquote>We have said that consciousness is an operation rather than a thing, a repository, or a function. It operates by way of analogy, by way of constructing an analog space with an analog &#x201C;I&#x201D; that can observe that space, and move metaphorically in it. It operates on any reactivity, excerpts relevant aspects, narratizes and conciliates them together in a metaphorical space where such meanings can be manipulated like things in space. Conscious mind is a spatial analog of the world and mental acts are analogs of bodily acts.</blockquote><p>Consider the mental act of multiplying 37 by 12. It seems to me that multiplication doesn&#x2019;t have to be &#x201C;seen in physical space&#x201D;, doesn&#x2019;t contain an observing self, is free of narrative, and isn&#x2019;t directly analogous to any physical behavior. When I multiply I don&#x2019;t think of myself stacking blocks in towers, I just manipulate mental objects with no context. And yet multiplying numbers in my head is an intensely&#xA0;<em>conscious</em> process, requiring full awareness and attention on the task. I can&#x2019;t multiply in my head while distracted, and the process always leaves a trace in memory at least in the short-term.</p><p>Of course, a hand calculator can multiply two numbers. Presumably what grants me consciousness is that it&#x2019;s like something to be me while I&#x2019;m doing the math, which is presumably not true of the calculator. But I&#x2019;m having a hard time seeing how this fits into Jaynes&#x2019; theory.</p><p>If anything, it seems that mental objects can fall on a ladder of abstraction, going from direct sensory experiences (the weight of a rock in your hand), to language (the word &#x201C;rock&#x201D; standing in for a category of things), to things like math and logic. Throwing a rock requires little consciousness, talking about it requires more, deriving the formula of its flight takes the most.</p><h4>Consciousness Following Language</h4><p>I challenged the book club to either steelman Jaynes&#x2019; assertion that #3 follows from #1 and #2 or point out if they think I mischaracterized the argument chapter. No one did either. In a poll of the likelihood we give Jaynes&#x2019; assertion that consciousness appeared after language for humans the median was my own 35% with a range of 1%-80%. After writing this post, I&#x2019;m down to 20% at most.</p><p>A good test of theory would be a feral child growing up without language, someone like <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genie_(feral_child)"">Genie</a> &#x2014; a girl who spent the first 13 years of her life locked alone in a room by her father before being discovered in 1970. It&#x2019;s hard to assess how conscious a teenager is as they&#x2019;re learning simple words for the first time, but Genie can provide some clues.</p><p>On the pro-Jaynes side, Genie didn&#x2019;t react to temperatures, even extreme ones, until several years after rejoining society. She also had trouble distinguishing herself from others, as evidenced by her ongoing confusion with the pronouns &#x201C;you&#x201D; and &#x201C;I&#x201D;. If bodily sensations and a sense of self are core markers of consciousnes, Genie was deficient in both in her pre-lingual state. But does that mean that a monk in ninth jhana is unconscious having detached from bodily sensations and dissolved their sense of self?</p><p>On the opposing side is the fact that upon learning rudimentary language, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genie_(feral_child)#Recalling_past_events"">Genie recalled and retold</a> some of her experiences from her pre-lingual days. Unless she was completely confabulating, this would point to conscious memories being created in the absence of language. A similar thing can be observed in deaf kids who grow up in a family that doesn&#x2019;t use sign language and learn a language only later in life.</p><hr class=""dividerBlock""><p>The assertion that consciousness follows language also implies the&#xA0;<em>modus tollens</em>, that you can have language without consciousness. Jaynes&#x2019; own argument that real language is built on conceptual metaphors would seem to contradict that.</p><p>Consider a concept like&#xA0;<em>decision tree</em>. You can think of a tree and come up with various associations you have with the term automatically. Same with the idea of making decisions. But to understand the word for the first time, to realize how the process of making discrete decisions is analogous to a squirrel running up ever-narrower branches, this connection seems to me to require consciousness.</p><p>Perhaps these conceptual, consciousness-requiring metaphors are a recent addition to human language and thought, and that would be the book&#x2019;s argument. But on the evidence presented by the book so far, metaphoric language requires consciousness more than the other way around.</p><hr class=""dividerBlock""><p>I started this post by noting that Jaynes&#x2019; greatest contribution may have been to pave the way to serious scientific inquiry into consciousness in the last few decades. And perhaps it could only be achieved through a genius-level application of <a href=""https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Cunningham%27s_Law"">Cunningham&#x2019;s Law</a>. Jaynes&#x2019; conclusions are provocative, and if his arguments are wrong they are wrong in subtle enough ways that refuting them requires serious thought and research.

K3FfdrCpBZ4G2c2Ys,Looking for AGI philosopher co-author on Draft Article: 'Optimising Peace to Constrain Risk of War from an Artificial Superintelligence',looking-for-agi-philosopher-co-author-on-draft-article,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/K3FfdrCpBZ4G2c2Ys/looking-for-agi-philosopher-co-author-on-draft-article,2020-04-06T16:50:54.639Z,2,3,2,False,False,,"<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p><p>An artificial superintelligence (ASI) emerging in a world in which war is still normalised may constitute a catastrophic existential risk, either because the ASI goes to war on behalf of itself to establish global supremacy (internal risk), or because an ASI might be employed by a single nation-state to wage war for global supremacy (external risk). We now live in a world where few states actually declare war; the last major declaration of the existence of a state of war was in 2008, for the Russo-Georgian War. This is because the 1945 United Nations&#x2019; Charter&apos;s Article 2 states that UN member states should &#x201C;refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state&#x201D;, while allowing for &#x201C;military measures by UN Security Council resolutions&#x201D; and &#x201C;exercise of self-defense&#x201D;. In this theoretical ideal, wars are not declared; instead, &apos;international armed conflicts&apos; occur. However, interstate wars, both &#x2018;hot&#x2019; and &#x2018;cold&#x2019;, still exist, for instance the Syrian Civil War, where an interstate proxy war is being waged, and the Korean War. Furthermore, a &#x2018;New Cold War&#x2019; between AI superpowers (the United States and China) looms. An ASI-directed/enabled future interstate war could trigger &#x2018;total war&#x2019;, including nuclear war, and may therefore be considered &#x2018;high risk&#x2019;. One risk reduction strategy would be optimising peace through a Universal Global Peace Treaty (UGPT), which could contribute towards the ending of existing wars and towards the prevention of future wars, through conforming instrumentalism. While this strategy cannot cope with non-state actors, it could influence state actors, including those developing ASIs, or the ASI itself, should it assume agency. An opportunity to optimise peace as a risk reduction strategy is emerging, by leveraging the UGPT off the announcement of a &#x2018;burning plasma&#x2019; fusion reaction, expected from circa 2025 to 2035, as was attempted in 1946 with fission, for atomic war, in the Baruch Plan.</p>",JohnCDraper,johncdraper,JohnCDraper,

You’re Alexander the Great, and your armies are marching toward Egypt from Gaza. There’s just one little problem: you need to cross the Sinai peninsula - 150 miles of hot, barren desert. How will you carry food and water for the troops?</p><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/4s2gbwMHSdh2SByyZ/fcv0pxxw3ncfbycf9ta5""><figcaption><i>Green triangle on the left is the Nile river delta in Egypt; green chunk in the upper right is Israel. The big desert peninsula between them is the Sinai.</i></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Option 1: carry it</strong></p><p>A physically-active human needs about 3 lbs of food per day. (Modern hikers can probably find lighter calorie-dense foodstuffs, but we’re talking ancient history here.) Water requirements vary; 5 lbs is a minimum, but the US Army Quartermaster Corps recommends 20 lbs/day when marching through a hot desert. Alexander’s army crossed the desert in 7 days. Food might be reasonable, but to carry the water would mean 7*20 = 140 lbs per person, <i>plus</i> 50+ lbs of armor, weapons, etc.</p><p>When I go hiking, I aim for a 20-30 lb pack. US marines are <a href=""https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/research/a25644619/soldier-weight/"">apparently expected</a> to be able to carry 150 lbs for 9 miles - quite a bit less than the 20+ miles/day Alexander’s army managed, and with no comment on how long the marine in question might need to rest afterwards. (Also, I’m not sure I trust that source - 150 lbs for 9 miles sounds unrealistic to me, and if it’s true then I’m <i>very</i> impressed by marines.)</p><p>Suffice to say that carrying that much water across that much desert is not a realistic option, even if we drink it along the way.</p><p><strong>Option 2: horses</strong></p><p>A horse consumes 20 lbs of food (half of which may be forage) and 80 lbs of water per day. In exchange, it can carry about 200 lbs (surprisingly, my source claims that horses can carry more than they can pull). Of course, that 200 lbs has to include the horse’s own food and water, plus whatever useful load it’s carrying. So, marching through a desert, a horse can only transport (200 lbs)/(80+20 lbs/day) = 2 days of supplies <i>for itself</i>, and that’s before whatever useful things actually need to be transported.</p><p>In other words, there’s a hard upper limit on how far goods can be transported by horse without refilling supplies along the way. That limit is around 2 days travel time without any refill, 10 days if there’s plenty of fresh water along the route, or 20 days if there’s both water and forage. At 20 miles/day, that’s 40, 200, or 400 miles. Realistically, if we want the number of horses to be reasonable, the limit is more like half that much - 20 miles, 100 miles, or 200 miles, respectively.</p><p>So horses also won’t work.</p><p><strong>Option 2.5: camels or other pack animals</strong></p><p>Contrary to popular image, camels actually need more water than horses. They can go a couple days without, but then need to fill up all at once. They can also carry a bit more weight, but they eat more food. At the end of the day, the numbers end up quite similar.</p><p>Mules also end up with similar numbers, and cattle are generally worse.</p><p><strong>Option 3: ships</strong></p><p>Assuming the army marches along the coast, a supply fleet can sail alongside. At the time, a single large merchant ship could carry 400 tons - in other words, as much as about 4000 horses. Presumably the ship would cost a lot less than the horses, too.</p><p>Well then, there’s our answer. Ships are clearly a vastly superior way to move goods. Range is a non-issue, capacity is far larger, and they’re far cheaper. They’re perfect for crossing the Sinai, which runs right along the coast anyway.</p><p>Fast forward a few years to 327 BC, and Alexander is marching his armies back from India. He plans to cross the Gedrosian desert, along the coast of modern-day Pakistan and Iran. The plan is much like the Sinai: a supply fleet will sail alongside the army. Unfortunately, neither Alexander nor his commanders knows about the monsoons: across most of south Asia, the wind blows consistently southwest for half the year, and consistently northeast for the other half. There is nothing like it in the Mediterranean. And so, Alexander marches out expecting the fleet to catch up as soon as the winds turn - not realizing that the winds will not turn for months. Three quarters of his soldiers die in the desert.</p><p>Thus end the campaigns of Alexander.</p><h2>Generalization</h2><p>The above numbers are drawn from Donald Engels’ book <a href=""https://smile.amazon.com/Alexander-Great-Logistics-Macedonian-Army/dp/0520042727/"">Alexander the Great and the Logistics of Macedonian Army</a>. But it tells us a lot more about the world than just the logistics of one particular ancient army.</p><p>First, this highlights the importance of naval dominance in premodern warfare. A fleet was a far superior supply train, capable of moving a high volume of food and water over long distance at relatively low cost. Without a fleet, transport of food became expensive at best, regular resupply became a strategic necessity, and long routes through arid terrain became altogether impassable. Destroying an enemy’s fleet meant starving the army. Likewise, controlling ports wasn’t just for show - without a port, feeding the army became a serious problem.</p><p>Another interesting insight into premodern warfare: away from friendly seas and rivers, the only way to keep an army fed was to either seize grain from enemies, or buy it from allies, either of whom needed to already be nearby. In Alexander’s case, deals were often struck to establish supply caches along the army’s intended route.</p><p>An interesting exercise: to what extent was transportation a binding constraint on the size of premodern towns/cities? (One number you may want: <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Civilization-Capitalism-15th-18th-Century-Vol/dp/0520081145"">Braudel</a> (pg 121) estimates that 5000 square meters of land growing wheat would provide one person-year of food, not accounting for crop rotation.) Leave a comment if you try a calculation here; I'm curious to see how other peoples' models compare to my own.</p><h2>Modern Day</h2><p>Today we have trains and trucks and roads, so the transportation constraint has relaxed somewhat. But here’s an interesting comparison: a modern 18-wheeler in the US is legally limited to haul 40 tons, while a panamax ship could carry about 50k tons through the canal (prior to the opening of the new locks in 2016). That’s a ratio of a bit over 1000 - surprisingly similar to the ship/horse ratio of antiquity, especially considering the much larger new-panamax and super-panamax ships also in use today.</p><p><img src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/4s2gbwMHSdh2SByyZ/k1ltpqb6igzhoasgdluc""></p><p>Can we get a quick-and-dirty feel for tautness of the transportation constraint today? Here are a few very different angles:</p><ul><li><a href=""https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/45165/41077_err160.pdf?v=0"">This USDA study</a> shows rates on produce transport, typically about 7-20 cents per pound (see figure 6). The Smart &amp; Final grocery store near me sells the cheaper produce items looked at in that study (bell peppers, cantaloupes, tomatoes, oranges) for 70-100 cents per pound, so transport alone is roughly 10-20% of the cost-to-consumer.</li><li>What about transporting humans? <a href=""https://www.visualcapitalist.com/average-commute-u-s-states-cities/"">Average commute in the US</a> is ~30 minutes each way; driving is usually in the 20-30 minute range, while public transit is usually 30-50. Assuming 8 hr workdays, that means commutes are typically ~10-20% of our work-hours.</li><li>The bureau of transportation <a href=""https://www.bts.gov/transportation-economic-trends/tet-2018-chapter-2-contribution-economy"">estimates</a> transport at 5.6% of the US economy for a very narrow measure, or 8.9% with a broader measure (though this still excludes non-market transport costs like e.g. commute time).</li></ul><p>My interpretation: the transportation constraint becomes taut when it accounts for 10-20% of cost. If it’s less than that, it usually doesn’t limit production - we see plenty of goods which aren’t transportation-dependent or which are higher-value-per-weight, and the transportation constraint is generally slack for those. But once transportation hits about 10-20%, people start looking for alternatives, i.e. producing the goods somewhere else or using alternative goods. Obviously this is not based on very much data, but I find it intuitively plausible.</p><p>Compared to ancient times, transportation constraints have obviously relaxed quite a lot. Yet qualitatively, the world today still does not look like a world of fully slack transportation constraints. To wrap up, let’s discuss what that would look like.</p><h2>Extreme Slackness</h2><p>In <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/xEFeCwk3pdYdeG2rL/p/eWxizGwgpNhckrzfc"">Material Goods as an Abundant Resource</a>, we discussed the world of the duplicator - a device capable of copying any item placed on it. In such a world, material scarcity is removed as an economic constraint - all material constraints are completely slack.</p><p>What would be a corresponding sci-fi device for transportation constraints, and what would that world look like?</p><p>I suggest portals: imagine we can create pairs of devices capable of transporting things from one device to the other, across any distance, at the speed of light. (We could instead imagine teleporters, removing the need for a pre-installed device at either end, but then the entire discussion would be about security.) What does the world of the portal look like?</p><p>First, there’s complete geographical decoupling of production from consumption. People have no need to live near where they work; companies can put offices and factories wherever real estate is cheap. We can enjoy miles of wilderness on the back porch and a downtown district on the front porch; a swimming pool can open right into the ocean. Buying direct from the farm or factory is standard for most material goods.</p><p>What are now tourist destinations would become options for an evening activity. Disneyworld would sell a park-hopper ticket that includes Disneyland California, Paris, and Shanghai, but the price of that ticket would be high enough to prevent the parks from becoming unpleasantly crowded - probably quite a bit more expensive than today, though possibly cheaper than today’s flights to Orlando.</p><p>Obviously roads would cease to exist. Huge amounts of land would revert from asphalt to wilderness, but buildings would also be much more spread out. Buildings would be built close together more for show than for function - e.g. to provide the ambiance of a downtown or a community to those who want it. Physical life, in general, would look more like the structure of the internet rather than the structure of geography; “cities” would be clusters very spread out in space but very tightly connected via the portal network. Filter bubbles would be a much more physically tangible phenomenon.</p><p>Geographically-defined governments would likely be replaced by some other form of government - governments based around access to portal hubs/networks are one natural possibility. Security would be a priority, early on - carrying an unauthorized portal into an area would earn a facefull of high explosives. On the other hand, it would be hard to prevent a high degree of mobility between areas controlled by different governments; the implications for government behavior are conceptually similar to <a href=""http://www.gramlich.net/projects/oceania/seastead2/"">seasteading</a>.</p><p>The structure of space near portal networks would be different in a big-O sense; the amount of space at a distance of about&nbsp;<span><span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""r""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">r</span></span></span></span><style>.mjx-chtml {display: inline-block; line-height: 0; text-indent: 0; text-align: left; text-transform: none; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 100%; font-size-adjust: none; letter-spacing: normal; word-wrap: normal; word-spacing: normal; white-space: nowrap; float: none; direction: ltr; max-width: none; max-height: none; min-width: 0; min-height: 0; border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 1px 0}

I concluded that the answer was &quot;no.&quot; Other posters pointed out that some people did bring it up early, and that we still did an above-average job at acknowledging and preparing for the pandemic. But I am still looking for a reliable alarm bell that will ring loud enough to hear it before the stock market crashes 20% next time there&apos;s a pandemic on the horizon.</p><p>This is my attempt.</p><p><em>Note: This questionnaire has passed two of my historical tests so far.</em></p><p><em>1) On 2009 H1N1 (swine flu) <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/u9Ei2xM5F5EoQLh7J/would-2009-h1n1-swine-flu-ring-the-alarm-bell"">it performed correctly, not &quot;ringing&quot; in the context of a stock market that just went up all year long.</a></em></p><p><em>2) On 2014 Ebola, <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/YeipHzh4xzwwfdAjG/2014-2016-ebola-would-not-have-rung-the-alarm-bell"">it performed correctly, not &quot;ringing&quot; in the context of a stock market that seemed at the time to be rumbling, but was in retrospect clearly just climbing upwards.</a></em></p><p><strong>Trigger to investigate</strong></p><p>Some threshold for investigating whether to ring the alarm bell is necessary. We can&apos;t be constantly scanning the atmosphere for any sign of smoke to signal the next fire. So I want a trigger for when we should bother to look into the threat of pandemic more closely.</p><p>Most of us at least casually browse the news. Making the trigger news-linked seems sensible.</p><p>The first COVID article in the New York Times was from Jan. 8th, <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/08/health/china-pneumonia-outbreak-virus.html?searchResultPosition=1"">&quot;China Identifies New Virus Causing Pneumonialike Illness.&quot;</a> It was on page A13. Several stories were published in the ensuing weeks. The first article on page A1 was &quot;<a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/21/world/asia/china-coronavirus-wuhan.html?searchResultPosition=7"">The Test a Deadly Coronavirus Outbreak Poses to China&#x2019;s Leadership</a>,&quot; on January 21st, a month before the stock market crashed.</p><p>A headline article in a major newspaper seems like a good candidate as a trigger to investigate using the method I&apos;ll explain below.</p><p><strong>A simple model of pandemic risk</strong></p><p>I created a four-factor model to evaluate pandemic risk. The factors are transmissibility, harm, spread, and institutional signals. Each are divided into several subcategories and are presented as questions. I believe each category could have been answered in a strong &quot;yes&quot; days or weeks prior to Feb. 20th, the edge of the stock market crash. Anyone following the news or capable of some quick scientific literature searches should have been able to answer them correctly without having a deeper understanding of the science or doing any mathematical modeling themselves.</p><p>Factor 1: Transmissibility</p><ul><li>Does the disease appear to spread from human to human?</li><li>Does the disease spread via indirect contact (coughing, sneezing)?</li><li>Is there any evidence that the disease is transmissible before or just after the start of symptoms?</li><li>Do any academic papers, especially in the Lancet or the New England Journal of Medicine, suggest the possibility of &quot;risk of much wider spread,&quot; &quot;exponential growth,&quot; or use similar phrases? Try searching &quot;[DISEASE NAME] exponential growth&quot; on Google Scholar.</li></ul><p>Factor 2: Harm</p><ul><li>Is there evidence that the disease has a 3% or higher mortality rate among those 60 (or even younger), or 1%+ mortality among those 50 (or younger)?</li><li>Can the disease last for two weeks in more serious cases?</li><li>Do around 5% of patients seem to require hospitalization?</li><li>Are there no vaccines or treatments that have been proven effective?</li></ul><p>Factor 3: Spread</p><ul><li>Is the world death toll over 2,000?</li><li>Has the disease been detected in at least 10 industrialized countries collectively containing a total of at least 1 billion people, found in people with no clear link to the original source?</li><li>Is the disease present in major cities with strong international travel links?</li><li>Has the disease spread in advance of a lockdown, or escaped it?</li></ul><p>Factor 4: Institutional response</p><ul><li>Has a city-wide lockdown been attempted in a city of a population of at least 10 million, or have travel restrictions to or from major economies been implemented?</li><li>Has the WHO or a similar organization declared an &quot;emergency of international concern&quot; or &quot;global emergency,&quot; or issued an even more severe warning?</li><li>Have there been several front-page news stories about the disease?</li><li>Are there reports or warnings of shortages of medical supplies from the most-affected regions?</li></ul><p>There are 16 questions here. My guess is that if you can answer 13 of them with a &quot;yes,&quot; it&apos;s time to ring the alarm bell. Although it would be ideal if they all came with clear sources, it&apos;s probably better to post and reconstruct your research later, than not to post at all.</p><p><em>Note: as Bucky pointed out in the comments below, it would be valuable to craft a set of &quot;alarm bell&quot; questionnaires which, based on the actual historical availability of COVID-19 data, would have been &quot;ringing&quot; a month, two weeks, one week, and two days before the stock market crash.</em></p><p><em>The cutoffs I chose here were all selected to have been passed prior to Feb. 20th, but for the death toll cutoff I just chose 2,000 as a nice round number, though we only hit that number a few days before the crash. I tried to strike a balance by requiring only 13 of 16 criteria, but that again was an arbitrary choice.</em></p><p><em>Deeper reasoning on these choices is of course ideal, but I think it&apos;s still a reasonable starting point.</em></p><p><strong>Ringing the alarm bell</strong></p><p>What should you do if you run this checklist and get a score of at least 13?</p><p>Take a look at <a href=""https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4695"">what Scott Aaronson wishes he&apos;d told </a>a friend on Feb. 4th. This is what he actually said, and what will likely seem reasonable to you next time you&apos;re in the same situation:</p><blockquote>For now, I think the risk from the ordinary flu is much much greater! But worth watching to see if it becomes a real pandemic.</blockquote><p>The outcome for his friend?</p><blockquote>A couple days ago, the same friend who emailed me on February 4, emailed again to tell me that both of her parents (who live outside the US) now have covid-19. Her father had to go to the emergency room and tested positive. Her mother stayed home with somewhat milder symptoms. Given the overloaded medical system in their country, neither can expect a high standard of care.</blockquote><p>This is the start of how, in hindsight, he wishes he&apos;d responded:</p><blockquote><strong>HOLY SHIT!!!!!&#x2014;GET YOUR PARENTS SOMEWHERE SAFE&#x2014;CANCEL ALL TRAVEL PLANS&#x2014;STOCK UP ON FOOD AND MASKS AND HAND SANITIZERS. SELL ALL STOCK YOU OWN!!! SHORT THE MARKET IF YOU KNOW HOW, OTHERWISE GET CASH AND BONDS. HAVE AN ISOLATED PLACE TO ESCAPE TO. IF YOU&#x2019;RE FEELING ALTRUISTIC, JOIN GROUPS MAKING THEIR OWN MASKS AND VENTILATORS.</strong></blockquote><p>Why didn&apos;t he, or the rest of us, respond with this kind of tone and early timing?</p><p>We were all waiting for a gigantic, powerful, bright-yellow steamroller of a consensus to flatten our doubts. We needed the stock market to crash before we started <em>really</em> talking about it every single day. We needed everybody else to be talking about it first. We should not wait that long. We can&apos;t afford to.</p><p>This is human nature, and while it&apos;s embarrassing, it&apos;s nothing to feel guilty or ashamed about. This community has a strong focus on preparing for future catastrophes and advocating for better preparedness. We should be learning from this now.</p><p>I think we need some kind of community standard for when we ring the alarm bell. There should be a standard for when anybody can do that, with no fear of embarrassment and a great deal of praise as long as they have justification.</p><p>In some factories, anybody can push the button to cease all work on the factory floor, for any reason, with no consequences if it was a false alarm.</p><p>This is probably too easy for our purposes. On the factory floor, you can see the issue with your own eyes. Your reputation with the colleagues you work alongside is on the line, regardless of the official consequences.</p><p>That&apos;s why I like the idea of a checklist, and I&apos;m submitting the one above as a tentative draft.</p><p><strong>Responding to the alarm bell</strong></p><p>If somebody rings the alarm bell, what should you do?</p><p>1. Because the first post may not have been based on the most accurate and up-to-date information, others should vet any sources submitted by the original poster, and look for better sources where they can. Compiling these sources, clipping out direct quotes that support each of the factors in the &quot;should I ring the alarm bell&quot; questionnaire, and writing up articles for easy sharing for a variety of audiences is a good step.</p><p>2. If my conjecture is correct, attaining a certain volume of new posts daily is key for making discussion and action on the topic feel normal. Early commentators and posters should focus on generating new topics for discussion and try to get new posts up quickly. The key is to create an appearance of robust discussion, in order to normalize it for people who are still hesitant to acknowledge pandemic as a real possibility and act accordingly.</p><p>3. Make it real for yourself. Stock up on a week&apos;s worth of groceries, other necessities, nice-to-haves.</p><p>4. Decide on and publicly announce your threshold for selling stocks. The point isn&apos;t to make a buck. It&apos;s to represent the gravity of the situation in a real way, and pull probably the biggest lever you have to signal your prediction to the economy. Remember, when you sell stock, you&apos;re not gambling: you&apos;re sending a price signal to the world. That is you ringing the alarm bell.</p><p>5. Start a conversation with your friends and family. Post on social media. Write an op-ed. Ask trusted people to investigate the evidence for themselves and write about it so that the responsibility isn&apos;t all on you. Remember, you&apos;re trying to put the key in the ignition of that gigantic steamroller of consensus opinion and turn on the motor. Make memes.</p><p><strong>But next time it will be different</strong></p><p>It seems possible that we&apos;ll see a global scale-up of stockpiles in the wake of this disaster. We&apos;ll have accumulated a lot of cultural knowledge about how to respond to a pandemic. Pandemic will be available in our collective memory as a real possibility. We might put in place some strong preventative measures, such as a crackdown on wild animal markets. Policies will change. Technology will advance, giving us better ability to predict, treat, and vaccinate against the next illness. The market might be on a hair trigger next time around.</p><p>Ideally, we&apos;d have periodic global review of the state of readiness.</p><p>A convenient report would be issued, perhaps in book form, giving a priori estimates of where we&apos;d expect the next pandemic to originate from, how our infrastructure has improved since last time, how markets have responded to warning signs that we encounter in the coming decades. We&apos;d have the information we need to judge whether things really are different.</p><p>Ideally, next time, the checklist I&apos;ve created here will not predict the onset of mass global response to pandemic accurately. That could be because we&apos;ve gotten so good at responding to pandemics that the same conditions don&apos;t create cause for alarm. Or it could be that we&apos;re so good at predicting them that the market responds much earlier, hopefully with the result that we never get to the same terrible state of affairs before government and NGOs are motivated to act. Either the building gets fireproofed or the alarm bell gets more sensitive.</p><p><strong>Modeling whether the situation has changed</strong></p><p>It would be valuable to construct some models akin to the one above to determine whether the context for pandemic risk fundamentally changes in the future.</p><p>1. List the major weak points of our current pandemic infrastructure. Can we point to ways in which they&apos;ve substantially improved compared to where we were pre-COVID-19?</p><p>2. Look at the organizations involved in signalling the next pandemic: the WHO, the CDC and its counterparts in other nations, the popular press, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (who donated $100 million to fight COVID-19 in January). What would we look for to gauge their threshold for ringing the alarm bell? How would we know if it has changed relative to 2020?</p><p>3. Our improving synthetic biology infrastructure will give us more resources to monitor, treat and prevent disease. It will also give us the power to make deadlier diseases. What technological improvements would expand the ability of a rogue actor either to resurrect an old superbug like smallpox, or to create a new one? What real security do we have against this possibility? With time, what is expanding more quickly: our ability to prevent or cause harm?</p><p>4. Who nailed this pandemic prediction on the head, with evidence and arguments and confidence that make us feel like it wasn&apos;t just a lucky guess? Is there a convenient way we can keep track of them so that we have a convenient source of guidance next time? We need to establish our go-to source of wisdom so that we don&apos;t have to do all the thinking in the middle of the next crisis.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>In a pandemic, a matter of weeks can make a difference of many thousands of lives, billions or trillions of dollars, and immense social disruption.</p><p>We will see another pandemic.</p><p>It might be worse. There&apos;s no clear reason why mortality and transmissibility of a virus should be inversely correlated. The next virus could be both more catching and more fatal than COVID-19.</p><p>Having clues and some commentary and a few posts here and there isn&apos;t enough.</p><p>Right now, we can&apos;t trust the established authorities to nail this. Is anybody feeling hunky dory about the way world governments are behaving now, or how they will change over time?</p><p>Nature won&apos;t provide us with a grace period. Rolling a 1 on a 20-sided die doesn&apos;t make the odds of another 1 on your next roll any less likely. Getting a heads on a coin flip doesn&apos;t increase the likelihood of getting a tails next time. The next pandemic could happen any time.</p>",AllAmericanBreakfast,directedevolution,DirectedEvolution,

Since I </span>

<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/rhythm-stage-setup-v2"">last wrote about my rhythm
setup</a>, I've again made a lot of changes!  Here's an example that
shows a bunch of what I'm doing now: (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwFRtFz1Gao"">youtube</a>)

</p>

<p>

The biggest thing I've added since the last rollup is a notion of
tempo.  I play drums with my feet as usual, and I've written some
simple heuristics (see <a href=""https://github.com/jeffkaufman/jammer/blob/master/jammermidilib.h""><code>estimate_tempo()</code></a>)
for identifying the downbeats.  Once you know where the downbeat falls
and how often they are, this opens up a lot of possibilities:

</p>

<ul>

<li>
<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podorythmie"">French
Canadian feet</a>.  The sharp click of the downbeat happens when I tap
my foot, but then the lighter taps on the upbeat and predownbeat can
happen 1/2 and 3/4 of the way through the beat.  I used <a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/Foot-Percussion--Nightingale--La-Belle-Rose"">three
samples</a> from the introduction to Nightingale's La Belle Rose on
their <a href=""https://www.nightingalevt.org/merchandise1.html"">Trois</a>
album for the three different sounds. (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckx9rvh-YqI"">youtube</a>)

</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Hi-hat patterns.  This is essentially the same as the French
Canadian feet, but the additional beats are on hi-hat instead of foot
taps.  A simple version puts the hi-hat just on the upbeat, but it can
also go on each quarter-beat, and the level of intensity can vary as
well.
(<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDuUm_LaXEw"">youtube</a>)

</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Bass patterns.  Again, the same sort of idea, but played on a
synth bass.  These follow the ""active note"" which is generally the
most recently played left-hand piano note.

(<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMQH8RxWziM"">youtube</a>)

</p>
</li>

</ul>



<p>

I've configured a few different drum kits, and a few different bass
sounds:
(<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OnTqt6zxAo"">youtube</a>)

</p>

<p>

These sound best in reel time, though I've added jig time as well:

(<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaBP4jkBHnU"">youtube</a>)

</p>

<p>

I normally have everything play straight, but after <a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/stretching-the-beat"">recording my mandolin playing</a> I
added a mode where the preup and predown beats fall 1/36th late and
the upbeat falls 1/36th early: (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkiPplT6eMM"">youtube</a>)

</p>

<p>

On their own these will just go until I tell them to stop, but I have
two main ways of adding control.  The first way is using the breath
controller to modify the intensity and add interest:

</p>

<ul>

<li>French Canadian feet:

(<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4D9jqwA7s"">youtube</a>)
</li>
<li>Hi-hat:

(<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AQtAbRWelI"">youtube</a>)
</li>
<li>Bass:

(<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZRuigoaM6U"">youtube</a>)
</li>

</ul>



<p>

The second way is using <a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/building-toe-buttons"">toe
buttons</a> to pause pieces of the sound and bring them back in:

(<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iij7WkI4LXA"">youtube</a>)

</p>

<p>

I've also added a new way to control the active note for when I'm
playing mandolin.  My <a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/footboard-v3"">V3 footboard</a> has
four pads on the right foot, and if I tell the system what key and
mode I'm in I can then choose between four chords.  I've been doing,
left to right:

</p>

<ul>
<li>Major: vi I IV V</li>
<li>Mixolydian: VII I IV V</li>
<li>Minor: V VI VII i</li>
<li>Minor: VII i III IV</li>
</ul>



(<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZibM021ZH8"">youtube</a>)

<p></p>

<p>

Mostly it doesn't matter whether chords are major or minor because
with the bass and jawharp I only play the root, but I've also added a
Hammond sound I trigger with the breath controller.  When I'm playing
piano I have the Hammond play only the 1 and 5 of the chord, while
when I'm playing mandolin I have it play thirds as well.  I've set it
to play whatever inversion places the notes highest in its range.

(<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYlCWE0yn8A"">youtube</a>)
</p>

<p>

Another thing I've added that follows the active note is pads.  I
think these sound best if not too loud, filling out the background in
an atmospheric way when I play mandolin.  They help counter the
problem that just mandolin and fiddle together would normally be a bit
thin.

</p>

<p>

Here's mandolin, kick, breath hammond, and pedal-controlled bass:

<p><em>Disclaimer: I don't really know game theory.</em></p>
<p>Plot the payoffs in a non-zero-sum two-player game, and you'll get a <s>convex</s>[<a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/z7YvA5osMotdL5F4w/conflict-vs-mistake-in-non-zero-sum-games?commentId=gBWqz6Q4bxJsfDN39"">1</a>] set with the Pareto frontier on the top and right:</p>
<p><img src=""https://i.imgur.com/ldeX9Ya.png"" alt=""Payoff to player 2 vs. payoff to player 1""></p>
<p>You can describe this set with two parameters: The <em>surplus</em> is how close the outcome is to the Pareto frontier, and the <em>allocation</em> tells you how much the outcome favors player 1 versus player 2. In this illustration, the level sets for surplus and allocation are depicted by concentric curves and radial lines, respectively.</p>
<p>It's tempting to decompose the game into two phases: A cooperative phase, where the players coordinate to maximize surplus; and a competitive phase, where the players negotiate how the surplus is allocated.</p>
<p>Of course, in the usual formulation, both phases occur simultaneously. But this suggests a couple of negotiation strategies where you try to make one phase happen before the other:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>""Let's agree to maximize surplus. Once we agree to that, we can talk about allocation.""</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>""Let's agree on an allocation. Once we do that, we can talk about maximizing surplus.""</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm going to provocatively call the first strategy <a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/01/24/conflict-vs-mistake/"">mistake theory</a>, and the second <a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/01/24/conflict-vs-mistake/"">conflict theory</a>.</p>
<p>Indeed, the mistake theory strategy pushes the obviously good plan of making things better off for everyone. It can frame all opposition as making the mistake of leaving surplus on the table.</p>
<p>The conflict theory strategy threatens to destroy surplus in order to get a more favorable allocation. Its narrative emphasizes the fact that the players can't maximize their rewards simultaneously.</p>
<p>Now I don't have a good model of negotiation. But intuitively, it seems that mistake theory is a good strategy if you think you'll be in a <em>better</em> negotiating position once you move to the Pareto frontier. And conflict theory is a good strategy if you think you'll be in a <em>worse</em> negotiating position at the Pareto frontier.</p>
<p>If you're naturally a mistake theorist, this might make conflict theory seem more appealing. Imagine <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/HFyWNBnDNEDsDNLrZ/the-true-prisoner-s-dilemma"">negotiating with a paperclip maximizer over the fate of billions of lives</a>. Mutual cooperation is Pareto efficient, but unappealing. It's more sensible to threaten defection in order to save a few more human lives, if you can get away with it.</p>
<p>It also makes mistake theory seem unsavory: Apparently mistake theory is about postponing the allocation negotiation until you're in a comfortable negotiating position. (Or, somewhat better: It's about tricking the other players into cooperating before they can extract concessions from you.)</p>
<p>This is kind of unfair to mistake theory, which is supposed to be about educating decision-makers on efficient policies and building institutions to enable cooperation. None of that is present in this model.</p>
<p>But I think it describes something important about mistake theory which is usually rounded off to something like <a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/01/24/conflict-vs-mistake/"">""[mistake theorists have] become part of a class that’s more interested in protecting its own privileges than in helping the poor or working for the good of all""</a>.</p>
<p>The reason I'm thinking about this is that I want a theory of non-zero-sum games involving counterfactual reasoning and superrationality. It's not clear to me what superrational agents ""should"" do in general non-zero-sum games.</p>

If two people  were to strive towards perfectly describing a chair there might be some  amount of difference between their description, but the difference would  be of no consequence. Thus, we don&#x2019;t ascribe any error bars to the  truth of an object being a chair.</p><p>When looking at the data resulting from the collision between some  particles, the instruments will have collected certain things that we  consider to be truthful insights into the events&#x2026; and indeed, one could  argue they differ much less than the mental pictures two individuals  have of a given chair.</p><p>However, we still try our best to determine the potential errors our  instruments might induce and account for them, thus attaching a margin  of error and a probability to the observation, because even minute  errors in particle physics are going to be much more consequential than  even glaring errors in two individual&#x2019;s conception of a chair.</p><p>That&#x2019;s also why discussions around gathering and interpreting data  from particle accelerators is a much more pertinent subject than a  discussion between a myope and a hyperope regarding their mental image  of a chair. In a way both of these discussions involve truth claims, but  the former is a &#x201C;truth&#x201D; that&#x2019;s worth defining more clearly. I would  argue that, the very reason why we might feel like this is so, is how we  can end up creating a better definition for its truth value.</p><p>But I digress, let&#x2019;s look at scientific truth for examples, it seems  that the two main features of generating scientific truth are:</p><h3>1. Comparison with other scientific truths via Occam&#x2019;s Razor.</h3><blockquote>Entities should not be multiplied without necessity.</blockquote><p>If you have the equation <code>y = x^2 * ((b &#x2013; 1) * (b + 1) - b^2)</code><br> and the equation <code>y = -(x^2)</code><br>, both formulations are true, both purport to model the behavior of <code>y</code><br> in relation to <code>x</code><br>  and both succeed at doing so. But the second formulation postulates the  simplest equation and only a subset of the variables in the first one,  so the second would be considered &#x201C;true&#x201D; in the scientific sense and,  I&#x2019;d argue, in the colloquial sense as well.</p><p>To give one example, we can have the statements:</p><p>a) Objects attract other objects towards them with an acceleration linearly correlated to their mass.</p><p>b) Objects contain primordial gremlins that use the forgotten magic  of the fae lords in order to attract other objects towards them with an  acceleration linearly correlated to the mass of the object they reside  in.</p><p>Both would have been equally correct at the time Newton made his  speculations about gravity, since objects large enough for him this  effect included only the planets, star and moons of our Solar system.  The existence of primordial gremlins skilled in fae magic at the center  of these entities is not something that cannot be easily disproved to  this day.</p><p>But, alas, Occam&#x2019;s razor tells us that, if a) and b) model the same  phenomenon (gravity) and we can reach a) by just removing a bunch of  entities (the primordial gremlins and the fae magic) from b), &#x201C;a)&#x201D; is  what we&#x2019;d define as &#x201C;the truth&#x201D;, at least until future evidence arises.</p><p>On the other hand, our good pre-scientific philosopher friar William of Ockham himself might postulate:</p><p>c) Objects attract other objects towards them at a given acceleration because God willed the world to be so.</p><p>Ockham might even astutely point out that the mass-proportional  theory of gravity seems to have a few flaws in it, e.g. the fact that  Mercury&#x2019;s trajectory doesn&#x2019;t seem to abide by the rules of gravity as  stipulated by Newton. On the other hand, the heavenly and earthly bodies  moving in the exact way we observed them because of divine ordinance  perfectly accounts for these various abnormalities.</p><h3>2. Popper&#x2019;s falsifiability</h3><blockquote>A hypothesis is falsifiable if some observation might show it to be false<br> </blockquote><p>Going back to our model of gravity, suddenly, we have an answer to  give to Ockham, something along the lines of: &#x201C;Hey, what this Newton  fellow postulated seems like something that could be disproved based on  observations about the movement of the planets and even of objects here  on Earth, however, I see no particular way of disproving the existence  of a predetermined divine order&#x201D;.</p><p>Even if Newton&#x2019;s theory has some observations disproving it and the  divine predeterminism theory doesn&#x2019;t, the former is still &#x201C;closer to the  truth&#x201D; because it is able to explain some observations while admitting a  way to be disproven.</p><p>We can even go further and say something like: The truth-value of the  hypothesis is proportional to how easy the observation[s] that can  disprove it would be to make.</p><p>Under this model, even a truth which upon attempt to falsify reveals  cases where it is untrue, is still fundamentally &#x201C;true-er&#x201D; than a truth  which doesn&#x2019;t admit falsification, or for which falsification would be  unreasonably hard to engage in.</p><p>However, the combination of these two criteria still leaves us with a few problems.</p><p>Namely the vast amount of truths that can be generated and which, by  applying these two criteria, we should consider to be valid until  further disproof.</p><p>This is indeed a problem, because truth is something we use to make  claims about the world we live in, so the fewer truths there are out  there, the easier it becomes to think clearly about the world.</p><p>I am by no means a fan of the idea that unified theory of everything  is worth pursuing, I&#x2019;m inclined to believe that any such theory would be  either so complex or so difficult to apply as to render it impotent.  Even if by a stroke of luck this wouldn&#x2019;t be so, coming up with one  would render our lives terribly boring.</p><p>However, there is something appealing about the idea that you can, in  any given zeitgeist, agree upon a finite list of models that, if fully  understood, would basically allow one access to the sum of human  knowledge.</p><p>Having too many theories about the going-ons in the world, even if  they are not contradicting, leads us into an epistemic swamp. Where one  could spend their whole life learning truthful things about the world  yet be rendered completely unable to help his fellow men or even  sublimate his own sorrows via this knowledge.</p><p>So ultimately, I think there must be a way to rank two true  statements or theories, to say that even though they are both based on  observation, even though Occam&#x2019;s razor can cut neither of them, even  though they are both falsifiable, one is nonetheless fundamentally  &#x201C;truer&#x201D; than the other one.</p><p>This seems like a rather difficult task, but conveniently enough our  collective actions would indicate such a criterion already exists, but  I&#x2019;ve seen nobody bother to spell it out, at least not in a way that I  found to be satisfactory.</p><h2>Truth value as magnitude of predictions</h2><p>Let&#x2019;s take as our competing example a recent <a href=""https://sci-hub.tw/10.1111/jasp.12064"">psychological experiment on trash-talking in competitive video games</a>) and the <a href=""https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Ancillary_Materials/Exemplars_and_Case_Studies/Case_Studies/Nuclear_Energy_for_Today%27s_World/04._The_Discovery_of_Fission_(1938)"">series of experiments that lead to the discovery of fission in the late 30s</a>.</p><p>In short, the psychology experiment involves taking two people,  making them play an american football video game on a PS2, instructing  them either to stay silent or to trash-talk their opponent. Based on  this some observations were made about the effect of talk talking vs  silence in the player&#x2019;s own performance and in that of this opponent.</p><p>The physics experiments that lead to the discovery of fission,  involved bombarding a mass of uranium with neutrons, and theorizing as  to the nature of the particles emanating from them. From this a  hypothesis came about that uranium atoms could become so unstable due to  this bombardment as to actually split into two separate atoms, which  would be repelled by each other due to their charge, resulting in the  release of a massive amount of energy. Finally, this led to experiments  proving this, providing to us the key to nuclear energy and an entry  point into how one might exploit the generative nature of this process  to cause an explosive chain reaction.</p><p>I can&#x2019;t find the original papers for the physics experiments, but  provided that this was being done in the 30s, I wouldn&#x2019;t even be  surprised if their statistical apparatus was less advanced than that of  the psychologists. Furthermore, whilst they had &#x201C;the gist of it&#x201D;, it  took much longer for their observation to materialize into concrete  theories that could be applied to produce nuclear energy and fission  chain reaction.</p><p>Nor is there any noticeable qualitative difference under Occam&#x2019;s  razor or looking through the lens of falsifiability between these two  experiments. Indeed, based on falsifiability alone one could argue that  the truth claims of the trash-talking experiment are much narrower and  much easier to disprove in terms of the experimental apparatus and prior  knowledge required.</p><p>Yet it seems obvious that the theory of fission is one of those &#x201C;key truths&#x201D; that underlies our understanding of the world.</p><p>It seems equally obvious that the reaction of an adult playing a  sports video game when his opponent insults his play-style is so  irrelevant to anything or anyone as to only be called &#x201C;truth&#x201D; or  &#x201C;knowledge&#x201D; under an imperfect or outright useless definition of those  terms. It is indicative of a bug in our language.</p><p>There&apos;re two problems that stem from this example, one is related to  treating the kind of mental illness that drives someone to run an  experiment yielding such trivial, uninteresting and useless results no  matter it&#x2019;s outcome. Alas, I think that for now that might be best left  to the psychologists&#x2019; own colleagues.</p><p>The other problem is one of differentiating clearly between these two  pieces of &#x201C;truth&#x201D; in order to give our intellect and funding to the  kind of endeavour that would generate the later and give our compassion  and care to those afflicted with the madness that would lead them to  generate the former.</p><p>The obvious differentiating factor between these fragments of truth,  at the time they were discovered, is their predictive magnitude.</p><p>If asked about the potential predictions one could make based on the  discovery of fission, the European physicists of the 30s might answer  something like:</p><p>&#x201C;Under a best case scenario this could potentially lead to us  producing amounts of energy which would make all current electrical  plants obsolete and solve the problems of pollution and cost for all our  energy needs, it might also lead to weapons so powerful as to destroy  our very planet. Under a more probable scenario, it could lead to a  source of energy that would be less polluting and more efficient than  our current power plants and to weapons so powerful as to allow us to  wipe entire capitals from the face of the earth in a mere second&#x201D;.</p><p>The magnitude of the prediction consists in the number of inductive  steps required to go from &#x201C;This is how a bit of uranium expels particle  when bombarded with neutrons&#x201D; to &#x201C;This is how you could blow up an  entire cities within a second with a device the size of a small car&#x201D;  compose a rather impressive chain. It also consists in the sheer  importance it&#x2019;s final conclusion.</p><p>Nuclear energy and nuclear chain reactions are two of the things that  one can infer from the possibility of fission in uranium atoms, but are  not in any way the only ones. These kinds of observations, when  integrated into the greater model of physics, have the power of  explaining and generating most of the objects in the modern world that  we would view as making our condition superior compared to the  generations that came before us.</p><p>On the other hand, if we are to ask the psychologists about what  predictions their experiment might entail, they might answer: &#x201C;Under a  best case scenario, where more similar studies are realized, it might  tell us whether or not trash talking your opponent is usually useful in  competitive games. Under the current circumstances, it confirms and  disconfirms some people&#x2019;s intuition about trash-talking in this very  constrained setting and might prescribe some optimal behaviors to&#x2026; ahm,  people people that want to win more often at playing pretend sports&#x201D;.</p><p>If we associate predictive magnitude to truth values, the distinction  is immediately obvious. But predictive magnitude is hard to quantify.  To some extent, it depends on one&#x2019;s personal values.</p><p>However, when it comes to comparing fields and subfields more closely  related in terms of impact, the answer to the question of &#x201C;which is the  prediction with a greater magnitude&#x201D; might become less obvious.</p><p>That is not necessarily a problem, at the end of the day my purpose  here is to describe a criteria under which to discard some truths as  completely irrelevant. The purpose here is to think about how to make  the set of truths that one must concern himself with smaller, rather  than reach the smallest possible set.</p><p>Indeed, if we come to disagree on the value of specific predictions,  that just means that we end up concerning ourselves with different  fields of inquiry and funding or helping with different projects. This  in itself is a good thing, as long as it&#x2019;s not taken to the extremes  that generate our modern pseudosciences.</p><h2>Predictive magnitude as a way of discerning personal truth</h2><p>Indeed, I think that predictive magnitude as a way of determining the  relevance of a certain truth is not only useful in science or  engineering, but could be generalized as the model we commonly used to  judge all truth, including those of interpersonal relationships.</p><p>Take for example our customs regarding monogamous relationships, these involve:</p><ul><li>Sacrificing sexual relationships with all other people<br> </li><li>Spending an exorbitant amount of money on a wedding ring and wedding<br> </li><li>Putting yourself at great risk of having to deal with financial loss, social shunning and legal issues in the case of a divorce<br> </li></ul><p>It seems like a traditional monogamous relationship has a lot of  downsides and the upsides (a small tax cut, in certain countries) is  rather tiny.</p><p>One could think of them as a remnant of ages past, where e.g.they  made for the only way to raise kids safely and they avoided the  spreading of STDs which were much more deadly back then. But I think  this is a rather reductive view and none of these reasons apply to our  modern world.</p><p>I would argue that the monogamous relationships endured in this  format, exactly because of their many potential downsides. Especially  because the downsides are much more poignant if one ends the  relationship and even more so if they engage in a new one afterwards.</p><p>Let&#x2019;s look at all the 4 items listed above and try to analyze them  through the lens of the kind of predictions that lead to them.</p><ul><li>Sacrificing sexual relationships with all other people, is  partially equivalent to saying &#x201C;I predict that I like you so much, I  would rather have sex with you than anyone else for the rest of my  life&#x201D;.<br> </li><li>Spending an exorbitant amount of money on a wedding ring and  wedding, is partially equivalent to saying &#x201C;I predict that even though  this amount of spending is beyond my means, it won&#x2019;t harm me in the long  run because it&#x2019;s a one-time thing&#x201D;.<br> </li><li>Risking financial, social and legal distress in the case of a  divorce, is partially equivalent to saying &#x201C;I predict that we can safely  ignore the probability of this horrible event, since we get along so  well I can&#x2019;t see it ever happening&#x201D;.<br> </li></ul><p>In other words, you are making predictions about how much you love  the person you are in a relationship with. While all these things might  not be beneficial on their own, they are beneficial in that they  reinforce the truth value behind the claim of love. Or, to put it even  more disgustingly corny way, they are an attempt at showing true love.</p><p>Indeed, that statement can be made about a lot of inter-personal  truths, such as friendship, which usually becomes stronger if the people  go through some sort of hardship together.</p><p>In a sense, friendship as we define it should involve more than just  grabbing a beer with someone every weekend, friendship is a prediction  of being able to rely one someone, so when that prediction comes true  (i.e. when you help them or when you provide mutual help in a hard  situation), the truth value of the friendship itself is reinforced.</p><p>This way of thinking about things also provides a framework of  thinking about the truth values in culture and religion. Cultures and  religion make claims without backing them up with any evidence, &#x201C;You  should give your kids gifts for Christmas and pretend a jolly magical  fat bearded man bought them&#x201D; or &#x201C;You should not kill and you should love  thy neighbour&#x201D;. These are implicit and explicit truth claims made by  religion and culture about how one should behave.</p><p>These sorts of claims stand un-backed by evidence, but within these  claims is the implicit assumption of &#x201C;If you act as if though they are  true, society will prosper&#x201D;. The only thing that does assign a truth  value to them is the fact that most members of society went along with  them for a long time and the implicit prediction they made came true  (since here we are).</p><p>Granted, this paradigm does not provide a way to think about the kind  of religious or cultural truths one should discard. Stick too closely  to the paradigm and you will end up defending slavery or the unjust  persecution of various groups purely out of conservative reasons, out of  fear of experimenting with anything new.</p><h2>Generators of truth</h2><p>Lastly, there comes the question of what this kind of thinking would have to say about generating new truths.</p><p>After all, asking &#x201C;What kind of predictions can this theory make ?&#x201D;  is all well and good once you&#x2019;ve got a complete theory, but most  promising theories are incomplete. Even once a theory is complete,  putting it in practice might involve a significant investment.</p><p>One may initially see little value in classifying and studying wild  animals and plants, but give that area of study the thousands of years  necessary to get from Aristotle to Darwin and you get a theory about how  life changes and propagates itself. Give it a hundred and a few more  years and you can start building modern genetics upon it,that certainly  has a lot of useful predictions it can bring to the table.</p><p>But ask Aristotel what&#x2019;s the point of trying to find traits that  separate animals, and not in his wildest dreams will he be able to say  &#x201C;Well, it could lead to recombinant DNA vaccine being created to prevent  deaths from Dengue and JE&#x201D;. At most he might make a claim such as  &#x201C;Well, we might be able to figure out which animals can be easily  domesticated&#x201D;&#x2026; but if that was his predictive scope, although it might  have had a huge impact, it would have horribly failed. All animals that  we could easily domesticate and put to use have been domesticated since  way before his time.</p><p>To take a more current example, various flavors of string theory are  yet unable to make any meaningful predictions. While I don&#x2019;t know enough  physics to comment definitively on this one, it seems to me that most  of the people involved in it wouldn&#x2019;t stick their hand in the fire about  any potential near-future predictive power either.</p><p>Even more so, some areas of study might never produce predictions of  any magnitude and yet we still consider them to be important.</p><p>So why should one study astronomy ? After all the vast majority of  inquiry into the subject matter have yielded nothing directly. What  little it has yielded, e.g. the ability to navigate based on the  positions of the stars, is no longer of use to us.</p><p>But obviously, the indirect results from the study of astronomy have  been astonishing. As mentioned before, gravity itself was postulated as a  result of trying to explain the movement of the planets.</p><p>Furthermore, a lot of modern physics, the kind that leads to the  creation of amazing things here on Earth, seems to stem from the  mathematical and conceptual apparatus that appeared from the study of  astronomy.</p><p>A very pessimist answer here would be something like &#x201C;It doesn&#x2019;t  really matter&#x201D;, after all for every well of truths that ended up being  useful there&#x2019;s probably a thousand others that amounted to very little.</p><p>Aristotel&apos;s writing might have sown the seeds of natural science, but  Aristotle had no way of knowing that Pyrrho&#x2019;s skepticism or Epicurius&#x2019;s  philosophy of mind were inferior paradigms from which to seek the truth.</p><p>I expanded a bit on my thoughts on this idea <a href=""https://blog.cerebralab.com/%5Bhttps://blog.cerebralab.com/The_questions_one_needs_not_address%5D(https://blog.cerebralab.com/The_questions_one_needs_not_address)"">here</a>.</p><p>But overall I don&#x2019;t think this answer holds much sway, neither with myself and I&#x2019;d think even less so with you.</p><p>A better answer might be that the generation of new truths without  any predictive value could be guided by the subject under which they  reside. For example, studying animals and plants seems to be generally  more fruitful of an endeavour than inquiries into the idea that all  perception is illusory. So Aristotle could gather his ideas under that  rallying cry as being somehow &#x201C;superior&#x201D; to that of an ancient skeptic.</p><p>The same could be said for comparing string theory to any number of  other systems of &#x201C;understanding everything&#x201D; proposed by quacks all over  the world. In that one could say, that the very fact that string theory  takes a line of thought which has previously yielded results, trying to  deconstruct processes into ever smaller components, increases it&#x2019;s  chances of yielding useful predictions.</p><p>Indeed, this seems to be the reason why experimental psychology,  which nowadays concerns itself with theories which I&#x2019;d view as utterly  devoid of meaningful truth, is still regarded as something worth doing.  Because experimental psychology in its original form, stemming from Amos  Tversky and Daniel Kahneman&#x2019;s theories about cognitive biases, proved  to reveal things with tremendous predictive power in areas where making  those predictions is tremendously useful.</p><p>An answer which allows for even more room would be putting more trust  into argument from authority and argument from people with skin in the  game.</p><p>If someone or some organization that has produced valuable truths  before claims it&#x2019;s working towards producing similar new truths, that is  the best we can do to judge it&#x2019;s progress until the discoveries and  theories amount to a truth of an acceptable predictive magnitude.</p><p>One could say that the truth claims are correlated with how invested their makers are into their predictive ability.</p><p>For example, let&#x2019;s say that back in 1992, a group of economists  fromUCL compose a theory that says, given current monetary policy, the  pound sterling will be able to meet the currency exchange limits for  staying in the ERM.</p><p>The economists make this theory, but have no particular stake in it  being true, they don&#x2019;t throw away all their money towards investment  strategies that would benefit from it being true, they don&#x2019;t stake their  tenure or their salary on the prospects of their theory&#x2019;s predictive  power. At most, they have their reputation to lose, but it&#x2019;s the custom  for economic theories to fail, so even that hit wouldn&#x2019;t be so harsh.</p><p>Let&#x2019;s say that back in 1992, George Soros also makes a theory as to  how the pound won&#x2019;t be able to meet the currency exchange limits to stay  in the ERM, he proceeds to throw billions of dollars at this  prediction, a tremendous chunk of his wealth, and to call all his  investor friend telling them to do the same. He is actively trying to  prove his theory true, by causing the event it predicts. Staking a  tremendous sum of money and a lot of his reputation and business  relations on this theory.</p><p>Should we assume that he is more correct ? Well, provided that both  his theory and the economists&#x2019; theory are equally valid in all other  aspects, and neither of them have made any meaningful predictions yet, I  would say that our answer should be that, given the amount of skin in  the game Soros&#x2019;s theory has, it should be the correct one.</p><p>But, this is all post factual interpretations of events, it&#x2019;s making  no predictive claims, so it&#x2019;s arguably kind of empty in terms of truth  value under this very theory of mine.</p><p>Alas, I do actually use this view in order to dictate my actions. For  example, I ignore most modern psychology based on it&#x2019;s lack of  predictive power. I stake both my investments and a huge chunk of the  time I spend learning new facts, working, looking at experiments and  understanding theories into machine learning (and into auto-ml in  particular) and into the biology and medicine involved in extending  lifespan and healthspan.</p><p>These two fields I&#x2019;ve named as my favorite, have tremendous  predictive magnitude associated with them and seem to rely on validation  methods much more focused on predicting the future in unknown ways,  rather than simply fitting past data.</p><p>I would be as brash as to claim that, in the future, those two fields  will end up producing more truths which we can all agree are meaningful  than experimental psychology and sociology, behavioral biology or  investment banking.</p><p>But that&#x2019;s a fairly weak claim, a stronger claim would be that these  two fields will prove to be much more relevant to our future than, say,  string theory or the pursuit of symptom-treating evidence based  medicine. I would venture as far as to give a high probability to that  claim, but if I had to stake my life on it, I would not venture that  far.</p>",George3d6,george3d6,George3d6,

I also would like to know if there exist a LessWrong Discord. </em></p><p>[...]</p><p><strong>The French Article</strong><br><br>This article is a bias cluster. But it&apos;s not just classic biases, there are conducts that aren&apos;t even on the traditional checklists. Something caricatured. Twenty-six patients used hydroxychloroquine versus 16 control patients. A hospital in Marseille recruited patients for treatment and other centers in other regions recruited the controls. The outcome was a substitute: the virologic negation of the nasal swab on the sixth day. </p><p><em>At day6 post-inclusion, 70% of hydroxychloroquine-treated patients were virologicaly cured comparing with 12.5% in the control group (p= 0.001).  </em></p><p>First, confusion bias. Randomization would serve to avoid confusion bias, which did not occur. But this study goes further, it causes confusion bias. Not preventing is not the same as causing it. </p><p>The unusual: patients in Marseille who refused treatment continued in the study as a control group! This causes great basal heterogeneity between the groups, because patients who refuse are different from patients who accept. When refusing a treatment, the patients should not be included in the study. In fact, in a clinical trial, potential volunteers do not refuse treatment. What they refuse is to enter the trial. </p><p>Following the pattern of irrationality, patients who met exclusion criteria (comorbidities, contraindications to the drug) were included in the study as a control group. More severe patients, previously in the drug group, were transferred to the control group. </p><p>Second, the study excludes from the treatment group patients who did not complete the treatment, in a gross violation of the &apos;intention to treat&apos; principle. Inadequately they call this &quot;loss of follow-up&quot;. There was no loss of follow-up, patients were still available to be evaluated. In fact, this is a protocol analysis, in which 6 out of 26 patients left the study: 3 because they went to the ICU, 1 because the patient died (!!), 1 because the patient was nauseated and another was discharged from hospital. Of the 6, 5 patients did not continue treatment because they got worse! And these were excluded from the control group.</p><p>Third, there is a possibility of performance bias promoted by differences in general behaviors between the groups. Open study, hospital treatment group different from the control group. We should look for signs: spontaneously 6 patients from the treatment group received azithromycin. Not that azithromycin will solve anything, but this is a sign indicative of greater attention or indication of adjunct care. </p><p>Fourth, risk of random error. This is clearly a small study, which greatly increases the probability of random error. The sample calculation brings the illusion of 85% power. However, it does not present the premise of swab positivity in the control group and estimates an unusual efficacy of 50%. Something too good to be true for most treatments, let alone for this one of low pre-test probability. Therefore, here we have a small study with high risk of random error. And for a small study to demonstrate &quot;statistical significance,&quot; it needs to be so large that it becomes &quot;too good to be true&quot;. </p><p>It&apos;s an 82% relative reduction in positivity. This usually does not happen. However, we must recognize that for antibiotic treatment this great magnitude of effect can happen. For example, if we compare antibiotic to placebo in severe bacterial infection, the size of the effect would be very large. On the other hand, we should avoid the illusion that we are using an antibiotic for the coronavirus.</p><p>Finally, here we are faced with a laboratory result, what we know as a surrogate endpoint. Even if we considered this result reliable, there would still be a great uncertainty of clinical benefit. </p><p>For all that, this is a study to be discarded, for its high risk of bias and chance. In Bayesian scientific thought, this study does not increase the probability of the hypothesis being true. <br><br><strong>The Pre-Test Probability</strong></p><p>There is evidence that the drug has antiviral action in vitro. This brings plausibility, which should not be confused with probability. Probability is mainly influenced by hypothesis-generating clinical data (specific analysis) and scientific ecosystem behavior in similar cases (generic analysis). We have no previous empirical data and it is unusual that treatment of one type of condition (malaria, protozoan) has relevant efficacy in another (viral). The probabilistic estimate should be made this way, thinking about the whole, and not the specificity brought by plausibility arguments. <br><br>Thus, we start with a very low pre-test probability treatment, we come across a study that has no value in modifying this probability, and we end up with the illusion of a treatment with a high probability of benefit.

I mean life as in the property shared by all living things. The &quot;are viruses alive?&quot; kind of life.</p><p>Life is really, really, useful. As a metaphor. Because its associated philosophical problems have been more or less dispatched, and this provides a model for how many other conundrums are going to probably, inevitably go.</p><p><strong>To recap: What&apos;s the problem with life?</strong></p><p>Did you know that Louis Pasteur was a proponent of vitalism? Yes, the same Pasteur who got a glassblower to make him a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swan_neck_flask"">swan-neck flask</a> so he could show that it was particles in the air, not air itself, that caused broth to ferment. He was convinced that fermentation was such an idiosyncratic marker of life that it was not reducible to ordinary chemistry.</p><p>Pasteur was not a dumb guy, and he didn&apos;t live all that long ago. This is important: Pasteur was not violating modern norms of thought. The way Pasteur thought about life is so compatible with modernity that we still use this way of thinking ourselves for other topics.</p><p>To Pasteur, living things had some hypothetical special property (the essence of life... <em>itself</em>). Things either had the special property or they didn&apos;t - if they didn&apos;t they were just boring nonliving matter, but if they had the special property then by virtue of this single property they could do diverse things like ferment broth, or synthesize urea, or reproduce themselves.</p><p>This is a very easy and natural way for people to think about life (certainly it was common among the ancient Greeks). Why? Because it&apos;s simply the prediction that our mental categories match up with the natural categories of the world. We mentally separate things into living and nonliving, and we have different habits of thought depending on this categorization. It would be so convenient if the world also separated things cleanly into living and nonliving, with different rules for each.</p><p>This easy logic works great for everyday cases - things in different mental categories will pretty reliably follow different everyday patterns. Pasteur&apos;s mistake was trying to substitute in &quot;universal laws&quot; for &quot;everyday patterns.&quot; You show me someone advanced enough to think about the work in terms of laws, and I&apos;ll show you someone advanced enough to invent vitalism.</p><p><strong>So what happened?</strong></p><p>Consider the reasoning applied to the question &quot;are viruses alive?&quot;. Pasteur would think about this as a question of whether viruses have that special property. They either have it and are alive, or they don&apos;t and are not. Abilities like fermentation are thought of as mere indicators for whether viruses have the special property. This is probably the right time to link to <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yA4gF5KrboK2m2Xu7/how-an-algorithm-feels-from-inside"">How An Algorithm Feels From Inside</a> as relevant.</p><p>Right around the time of Pasteur, the argument between &quot;vitalists&quot; and &quot;mechanists&quot; was undergoing its big shift. There were always arguments for mechanism alongside those for vitalism, at least since Aristotle and Democritus, but what changed was a combination of both empirical and conceptual advances. The boundary between living and nonliving matter was eroded by advances like the artificial synthesis of urea, the discovery of muscles&apos; response to electricity, and the mapping of the cell. And conceptually, developments in evolution, cytology, and even thermodynamics were being synthesized into a more detailed and satisfying version of the mechanistic account of life.</p><p>Eventually, as the early 20th century rolled around, vitalism just wasn&apos;t as convincing to people anymore. It was never disproved wholesale - people still happily maintained that there was some special property to living matter even after excluding fermentation from the special abilities of life. But the number of those people dwindled, and as people used the mechanistic picture more and more, they worried about the essence of life less and less.</p><p>These days, if you ask some sophisticated person &quot;are viruses alive?&quot; you&apos;ll probably get an answer that talks about how they have a lot of the machinery of life, and certainly evolve, but don&apos;t have some of the other things we normally associate with life, like metabolism. And this is widely regarded as a full and maybe even satisfying answer, even though it never actually says &quot;yes they&apos;re alive&quot; or &quot;no they&apos;re not.&quot; But the spirit of vitalism lives on in those who persist in trying to find out if viruses are, after it all, <em>really</em> alive.</p><p><strong>Is this about consciousness? It&apos;s about consciousness, isn&apos;t it.</strong></p><p>Okay fine, the most obvious metaphor here is consciousness. So I might as well get it out of the way.</p><p>When we look around, we see a difference between conscious things and unconscious things, and it&apos;s very intuitive to suppose that there&apos;s some special property at work. Either you have the special property and are conscious, or you don&apos;t and are not.</p><p>Let&apos;s dig in to the life metaphor. We can construct quite a strong steelman of the modern vitalist. &quot;Sure,&quot; they say, &quot;we can answer all sorts of physical questions about the virus. But you&apos;re not saying whether it&apos;s actually alive. In fact, your entire way of thinking about this problem has abandoned the ability to answer the question of whether anything is <em>actually</em> alive! And aliveness matters! For example, I only care about animal rights because animals are alive - if they weren&apos;t alive, I wouldn&apos;t care about them. So predicting certain behaviors of physical systems is all well and good, but we also need a framework that solves the &apos;hard problem of aliveness,&apos; taking a physical description (if possible) of a system and telling us not just about its behaviors, but whether it&apos;s <em>really</em> alive.&quot;</p><p>This is of course cribbed straight from Saul Kripke, David Chalmers, et al. talking about consciousness. I don&apos;t think they would object to this depiction of the similarities - they would just say that there are also differences, which mean that a similar way of thinking about the world is right in the case of consciousness. I&apos;m not going to dive into these possible arguments - my goal here is, instead, to take the example of life and find the analogous way forward.</p><p>These days, we don&apos;t feel like we&apos;re missing some important fact if we don&apos;t say for certain whether viruses are alive - instead, the <em>modus ponens</em> has gone the other way, with edge cases illustrating how what Pasteur was thinking of as a single essence is not so unified after all. We can imagine a future where something similar happens to consciousness.</p><p>But what about important uses of the idea of &quot;alive,&quot; like in moral decisionmaking? Well, we usually just recognize that we have some commonsense notion of life, based on a cluster of correlated properties, that&apos;s good enough in everyday cases. If there&apos;s some crucial decision where it&apos;s important to be precise (e.g. what counts as a sign of extraterrestrial life), we would try to break the decision down into physical patterns that we care about, rather than holding fast to a decision rule in terms of &quot;aliveness&quot; and trying to be precise about which edge case have the special property. This could as well be done for &quot;consciousness&quot; as for &quot;aliveness.&quot;</p><p><strong>But this has somewhat wider application.</strong></p><p>This kind of imagination exercise is really what this post is about. We have plenty of properties that we think of as special properties that attach themselves to objects in a physically implausible way, rather than in terms of a fine-grained explanation. If this special property starts to cause trouble, life is an excellent paradigm case to refer back to for how we might navigate an ordinary physical world.</p><p>Some more example distinctions, of varying degree of seriousness:</p><p>Intentional / Unintentional actions</p><p>Food / Not food (More generally, lots of things related to Purity / Contamination)</p><p>Free-willed agents / Un-free actors</p><p>Legal / Illegal (I&apos;m trying to find a great old blog post about a professor assigning two students to research different sides of a complicated case, and both students being convinced that the case had a uniquely right side [theirs, of course])</p><p>Me / Everything Else</p>",Charlie Steiner,charlie-steiner,Charlie Steiner,
KnGf2AprvTJYn8zhd,Partying over Internet: Technological Aspects,partying-over-internet-technological-aspects,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/KnGf2AprvTJYn8zhd/partying-over-internet-technological-aspects,2020-04-05T06:20:01.067Z,30,10,2,False,False,,"<div> <p>Now, with billion people locked down in their homes, social contact over Internet becomes an increasingly important topic. Not only it allows people to stay in touch, it also lowers the incentives to <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/04/uks-covid-19-lockdown-could-crumble-as-frustration-grows-police-warn"">leave one's home and meet people in person</a> and thus contributes to the public health.</p> <p>I threw an online birthday party few days ago and in this article I would like to share some of my observations about how a party over Internet differs from one in the physical world and point out some implications and possible improvements for videoconferencing software.</p> <p>To start with, existing videoconferencing software is geared towards business meetings. And the differences between a business meeting and a party are easy to spot: At a party, there's much less structure. While at a meeting it's typically just one person that speaks and everybody else listens, at a party people tend to speak in parallel. At a party, non-verbal communication (facial expressions, gestures) is crucial. At a business meeting, not so much. At a meeting one wants to maintain self-control. At a party, one often rather wants to get rid of it. And so on and so forth.</p> <p>So, let's move directly to my observations:</p> <h3><span>Everyone should be visible</span></h3> <p>Unlike with Google Hangouts where the person speaking is displayed in full-screen view and everyone else as a small icon on the side, at a party a want to see everyone in parallel. Sometimes, it's someone's non-verbal accompaniment of someone else's speech that's the real fun. But even when that's not the case, I still want to follow how everyone reacts to what is being said, whether they are laughing, paying attention, not paying attention, preparing a snack, drinking, smoking or whether they have left for a moment, leaving just a lonely chair visible in the window.</p> <p>In short, I want to see all the participants of the party, side by side, all of them in equally sized windows. Size of the window is too expensive a piece of psychological real estate to waste on such an obvious thing as ""who's speaking at the moment"". More about that below.</p> <h3><span>Looking at people</span></h3> <p>Maybe the most unpleasant part of social videoconferencing is not being able to follow who's looking at whom. Everyone just stares, indiscriminately, at the camera.</p> <p>I have no idea of how reliably the existing eye-tracking software works. After browsing the web for a minute it seems that eye tracking is used mostly for… optimizing ads??? What a waste of resources!</p> <p>Anyway, it doesn't matter. Whether the software uses webcam to trace your gaze or whether you use mouse to explicitly point to whomever you are looking at the implications are more or less the same: First, I want the window I am looking at to get larger. Second, I want the person on the other side to know that I am looking at them - not necessarily in any obtrusive manner, I just want them to be aware of it, presumably by making my image slightly larger.</p> <p>To give a practical example: One of the participants at the party wears an amusing mask. I point to the corresponding window which makes it larger and allows me to inspect the details of the mask. The person in question sees that I am looking at them and that, possibly, others are looking as well. They may choose to react to that.</p> <p>Taken together, one would see large image of the person they are looking at, somewhat smaller images of people looking at them and small images of everyone else. That, I think, more of less reflects how people perceive each other in real-world social interactions.</p> <h3><span>Eye contact</span></h3> <p>If I look and someone and that person looks back at me, that's a powerful social signal and it should be reflected by the software. For example, in such a case we could get a special communication channel, where not only we see each other in large windows but also the talk by other people can be muffled so that we can hear each other well. (By the way, this protocol of looking and looking back is based on ""<a href=""https://www.verytangostore.com/cabeceo.html"">cabaceo</a>"" as practiced when dancing tango: You can invite a person to dance with you by looking at them and they may accept by looking back or refuse by looking away.)</p> <p>In this post I am not going to speak about larger parties but the problem there is obvious: With many people present there are going to be many parallel conversations, resulting it too much noise and not being able to hear each other properly. Clearly, some kind of fluent separation of the party into subgroups is needed. And while this seems to be a hard problem, the eye contact protocol described above can be used at least as a starting point: Cabaceo protocol allows to create groups of two people. Can it be somehow generalized for groups of three or more?</p> <h3><span>Kissing</span></h3> <p>In many cultures, kissing is an important part of social interaction. However, it doesn't lend itself well to communication over Internet.</p> <p>Skype allows you to send an emoticon (e.g. a symbol of a heart) to your counterpart. But that doesn't really convey that feel of intimacy that the real kiss does. After all, emoticons were invented to be a substitute for non-verbal communication in the situations where people don't see each other (SMS, email) which makes them, in the context of videoconferencing, redundant at best and embarrassing at worst.</p> <p>Obviously, sending a kiss through video can't be solved by purely technical means. It would require some social innovation. If Eskimos can kiss by rubbing their noses, why can't we devise a special Internet kiss? But if we do, the experience can be greatly improved by the software.</p> <p>Consider the cabaceo protocol above. What if a kiss worked like this: I look at the other person. The other person looks at me. Our windows get larger, everyone else fades into background. Surrounding noises are muffled. Then we both touch cameras with our noses.</p> <p>It would have to be tested in practice, but it kind of looks like it could feel quite intimate.</p> <h3><span>More social signals</span></h3> <p>In the physical world there are many more ways to send social signals.</p> <p>Consider, for example, the seating order. If I sit next to someone it may mean that I want to speak with them, or I may want to signal that I belong to a certain subgroup or maybe it was just the only empty chair left. (Note that many social signals are weak and ambiguous. But that's a feature, not a bug!)</p> <p>Now, I've used seating order just as an example. Not everything that exists at a physical party has to be necessarily mimicked in an online party. However, if the developers of the videoconferencing software decide that seating order is worth mimicking, then it has implications for the product design. For example, ordering of windows on the screen would have to be the same for everyone. It can't be that you can rearrange them arbitrarily. Should sitting next to someone else come with some extras? Maybe I can whisper to a person sitting besides me. Etc.</p> <h3><span>Miscellaneous</span></h3> <ul> <li>There's a natural worry that seeing only people's faces is going to prevent a lot of non-verbal communication (gestures). However, my anecdotal evidence is that people, especially as the party progresses, subconsciously tend to move away from the camera making their entire upper body visible and thus improving non-verbal communication channels.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Partying online is not all downsides. One upside is that, being at home, people have all kind of inventory at their disposal, which, at a meatspace party, they don't. In our case we've used a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plague_doctor_costume#/media/File:Medico_peste.jpg"">plague mask</a>, a <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91uTc7G0PoL.jpg"">peacock feather</a>, a <a href=""https://www.quien.net/wp-content/uploads/politica-quien-es/Subcomandante-Marcos.jpg"">bandana</a>. There may be no technological implications, but I think the behavior is worth mentioning anyway.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>It's unclear whether you should see yourself among the participants of the party. On one hand, seeing yourself leads to more self-control, which is not that desirable at a party. On the other hand, people do like the feature and would probably feel awkward if it was removed. Feedback from a friend: ""If I am not on the screen it would feel like I am not present at the party.""</li> </ul> <h3><span>Conclusion</span></h3> <p>These are just some random thoughts that I'm giving free to anyone who fancies to implement them. However, if you do, please do let me know! It would be really interesting to see how this works in practice.</p> <p><strong>April 5th, 2020</strong></p> </div> <p>by <span><a href=""http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/martin-sustrik""><img src=""http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=939&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1586067363"" /></a><a href=""http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/martin-sustrik"">martin_sustrik</a></span></p>",sustrik,sustrik,Martin Sustrik,

The comments there give many good reasons against her claim that unreferencable entities don&apos;t make sense. Nonetheless, I think it is worthwhile to consider this issue in more detail as there are many philosophical problems in which seemingly unreferencable entities arise. </p><p>We will begin by making two key points about references. Once we understand them, we will have dissolved the paradox.</p><p>Firstly, &quot;referencable&quot; is relative to the agent. If the universe consists of two non-interacting boxes, then agents in the first box can reference object in the first box and agents in the second box can reference objects in the second, but neither can reference objects in the other. Further, if an agent is in a simulation with no access to the outside, that agent can only reference objects in the simulation, while someone outside can reference objects in both the external world and simulation.</p><p>Secondly, even when given an agent as a reference frame, we still need further clarification. Here&apos;s a list of things we might want to reference:</p><ul><li>Phenomenal content such as an image of a chair</li><li>Objects such as the chair we presume to be behind the image</li><li>Properties like red or round</li><li>Universals like the idea of a chair</li><li>Abstract concepts like the number 2</li></ul><p>Each of these kinds of entities is referred to in a slightly different manner. Precisely defining how each of these works would be a very involved task, so I&apos;ll just sketch it out quickly. The purpose of the following paragraph is only to show how we could go about doing this:</p><p>For phenomenal content, we have the ability to recall what we experienced and interface it with the rest of the brain. We typically reference objects by experiencing visually or through our other sense or indirectly via scientific instruments and saying &quot;Whatever is creating that experience&quot;. For primitive properties, a person will normally understand the meaning if they are told a bunch of objects are in the class and a bunch of objects aren&apos;t. For non-primitive properties, we can use the same method or we can define these in terms of other properties.</p><p>Again, the specifics aren&apos;t important. The point is only to illustrate that even though these all look alike on the surface, the actual manner in which these entities are triangulated greatly varies.</p><p>Some people would say that we can&apos;t reference some of these entities as merely being able to saying the words doesn&apos;t mean we can pin down the object enough for us to be able to truly say we are referencing it. And fair enough, but where this line is drawn is ultimately a matter of linguistic convention rather than a matter of metaphysics.</p><p><strong>The Unreferentiable</strong>:</p><p>We&apos;ve explained above that some agents can reference objects that are unreferenceable to other agents. However, even if an agent can&apos;t reference entity X, an agent can construct a model of a world containing itself and an entity X&apos; that stands in for X. It can even imagine an agent Y that can reference X&apos;. How is this possible? Doesn&apos;t providing a stand-in for X involve referencing the object we said was unreferencable? </p><p>Well, as we just noted, there are difference senses in which we can reference an object. Let&apos;s make this concrete: Imagine a programmer and a manager observing a perfectly closed system containing an AI human and an AI dog. The AI human can reference the AI dog by &quot;seeing&quot; it and presuming there is an entity behind what it is seeing. It can&apos;t reference the external agents in the same way. However, it could construct an internal model containing a programmer and an AI system which the manager could interpret as a reference to the programmer. The AI human can&apos;t include a full copy of itself inside the model, but it can include general description of itself which will be recognisable to the manager.</p><p>Referencing an entity through perceptions and by positing a reflective model are entirely different types of reference. Many people would prefer that we limit the term reference to apply to the former, which is perfectly fine so long as they allow there to be a word for the second, non-reference kind of reference. Personally, I prefer to just call this Reference by Analogy.</p><p>One potential objection is that such references could fail to be resolve such as if there are two programmers, making the reference underspecified. But that&apos;s hardly unique to this situation: what if there isn&apos;t actually a chair object behind the chair image, but it is all in the imagination?</p><p>I want to finish by reiterating the point of this article in as simple a manner as possible: An entity can be unreferencable in one sense, but referencable in another. In fact, we should probably just <a href=""https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Rationalist_taboo"">taboo</a> this word the majority of the time.</p>",Chris_Leong,chris_leong,Chris_Leong,

</style></head><body><h1>Foreword</h1>
<p>What is functional analysis? A satisfactory answer requires going back to where it all started.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>""All are present; the meeting convenes,"" intoned Fredholm. Intent were the gathered faces, their thoughts fixed on their students. ""<em>What do we know of their weaknesses?</em>""</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Hilbert leaned back, torch's light flickering across his features. ""Lots of dimensions, especially when they need to find the Hessian. What if… what if we made them deal with <em>infinitely</em> many dimensions?""...</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It was Banach who finally spoke. ""David, they already know about the vector space for the polynomials"".</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Hilbert smirked. ""Who said anything about <em>countably</em> infinite?"". More silence, then glances, then grins.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It was Riesz's voice which next broke the silence. ""And we can make them do analysis in that space. And linear algebra, but not the easy parts. Of course, they'll need to also deal with complex numbers. Sprinkle a little topology and abstract algebra on top, because... they deserve –""</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>""Frigyes, some of them might actually be able to do that. We need more."" After a pause, Fredholm continued: ""We'll tell them that they only need to know basic calculus.""</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>A Friendly Approach to Functional Analysis</h1>
<p>I didn't actually find the book overly hard (it took me seven days to complete, which is how long it took for my first book, <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/s/KGYLvTqFiFE2CpHfJ/p/WPtdQ3JnoRSci87Dz""><em>Naïve Set Theory</em></a>), although there were some parts I skipped due to unclear exposition. it's actually one of my favorite books I've read in a while – it's for sure my favorite since the last one. That said, I'm very glad I didn't attempt this early in my book-reading journey.</p>
<h2>My brain won't stop line to me</h2>

<p>This concept is important because it's what you use to prove e.g. that a line is the shortest continuous path between two points.</p>

<p>I'm having trouble understanding functional derivatives. I'm used to thinking about derivatives as with respect to time, or with respect to variations along the input dimensions. But when I think about a derivative on function space, I'm not sure what the ""time"" is, even though I can think about the topology and the neighborhoods around a given function.</p>
<p>And I know the answer is that there isn't ""time"", but I'm not sure what there <em>is</em>.</p>
<p>An interesting concept that comes to mind is thinking about a functional derivative with respect to e.g. a straight-line <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy"">homotopy</a>, where you really <em>could</em> say how a function is changing at every point with respect to time. But I don't think that's the same concept.</p>

<p>By normal map, is that something like a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_operator"">normal operator</a>?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sorry, I didn't mean normal in a technical context. Since the subspace I introduced is one-dimensional (as a complex vector space), and it maps to the complex numbers as well, we have good old introduction to complex analysis derivatives here. If you like you can work with reals instead of complex variables too, in which case it would be the familiar real derivative.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I don't think it's clear yet.

<p>I guess I'm confused why we're using that type signature if we're taking a derivative on the whole function – but maybe that'll be clear after I get the rest.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>that is exactly the heart of the confusion surrounding functional derivatives, and we'll have to get there in a few steps.we'll start with defining functional derivatives for easy maps, i.e. the ones that take on complex values, and then work towards more complicated settings.</p>

<p>this is formally difficult because usually you want this derivative to have some nice properties, but because it was defined pointwise it's very difficult to establish this! Frequently these derivatives are not continuous, and mathematicians resort to horrible tricks (like throwing out a bunch of points of the domain X on which our derivative is annoying) to recover some structure here.</p>

<p>also something that may help with gaining insight: in multivariable calculus (lets say 2 dimensions, that's already plenty difficult) there is a clear divide between the [existence of a partial derivative of a function at a point] and [the function being differentiable at that point].</p>

<p>ETA: Back in my <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/TSLnckszv4Tb5cHmt/insights-from-topology""><em>Topology</em> review</a>, I discussed a similar phenomenon: continuity in multiple input dimensions requires not just continuity in each input variable, but in <em>all</em> sequences converging to the point in question:</p>
<p><img src=""https://i.imgur.com/k6b4WRE.png"" alt=""""></p>
<p>""Continuity in the variables says that paths along the axes converge in the right way. But for continuity overall, we need all paths to converge in the right way. Directional continuity when the domain is <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\mathbb{R}""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-texatom""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-ams-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">R</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> is a special case of this: continuity from below and from above if and only if continuity for all sequences converging topologically to <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""x""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">x</span></span></span></span></span></span>.""</p>
<p>Similarly, for a function to be differentiable, the existence of all of its partial derivatives isn't enough – you need derivatives for every possible approach to the point in question. Here, the existence of all of the partials automatically guarantees the derivatives for every possible approach, because there's a partial for every function.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>here we have the same, except we have (in an infinite-dimenional function space X) infinitely many 'partial derivatives'. so from that point of view it's not that surprising that a function ""having a derivative at <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""f""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.519em; padding-right: 0.06em;"">f</span></span></span></span></span></span>"" is actually quite rare/complicated.</p>

</ul>
<h2>Final thoughts</h2>
<p>The book is pretty nice overall, with some glaring road bumps – apparently, the Euler-Lagrange equation is one of the most important equations of all time, and Sasane barely spends any effort explaining it to the reader!</p>
<p>And if I didn't have the help of TheMajor, I wouldn't have understood the functional derivative, which, in my opinion, was <em>the</em> profoundly important insight I got from this book. My models of function space structure feel qualitatively improved. I can look at a Fourier transform and see what it's doing – I can <em>feel</em> it, to an extent. Without a doubt, that single insight makes it all worth it.</p>
<h1>Forward</h1>
<p>I'm probably going to finish up an epidemiology textbook, before moving on to complex analysis, microeconomics, or... something else – who knows! If you're interested in taking advantage of quarantine to do some reading, feel free to reach out and maybe we can work through something together. 🙂</p>

I genuinely wasn&#x2019;t sure if I would be able to tell the difference between a day with four hours of deep work and one with eight hours. Surely we could narrow down the hypothesis space from that!&#xA0;</p><p>So, I designed a simple experiment. I would do one hour of deep work each day for two days, then two days of four hours each, and finally two days of eight hours each.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Why I chose this experiment&#xA0;&#xA0;</strong></p><p>I optimized for quickly testing large effect sizes to narrow my uncertainty. I didn&#x2019;t expect this experiment to be rigorous or sensitive to small nuances -- n=2 per condition, and I would love to hear any suggestions for how to blind me to whether I was working one or eight hours that day.&#xA0;</p><p>But by doing such an extreme experiment, I would definitely see an effect.&#xA0;</p><p>My output would have to be uncorrelated with hours worked for me <em>not</em> to. If I couldn&#x2019;t easily tell a difference in the output between the conditions, it would indicate diminishing marginal returns massively influenced my output. Otherwise, I could get a rough guess at if and how much my output declined.&#xA0;</p><p>My guess was that I would get between 50% to 200% more done per hour on the one-hour day than the eight-hour day. I was less sure about the four-hour days, but I guessed my hourly output would fall in between that of the one-hour days and the eight-hour days. I would be quite surprised if I got more done per hour on the eight-hour day than the one-hour day. (Confession, I forgot to write these down before starting the experiment, so I&#x2019;m writing them now after collecting data but before looking at the results.)&#xA0;</p><span><figure><img src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5ad8da815ffd20813824d475/1585355026109-3HJBKHR23EIAZJE50MRP/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kBXOnS_ckY-N0Nt3EgoT00hZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWQUxwkmyExglNqGp0IvTJZamWLI2zvYWH8K3-s_4yszcp2ryTI0HqTOaaUohrI8PIq4eCtsRbVJG-CkT_G2ER8zcUXVnKL9GpzVAoVsqPKFY/Prediction+interval+pre.png?format=1500w"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:40%""></figure></span><p><strong>Methods</strong></p><p>In order to have somewhat comparable results, I spent all twenty six hours writing and tracked how many words I wrote each hour. I scheduled coworking sessions on Focusmate.com to hold myself to a schedule. Since the Focusmate sessions are fifty minutes long, I operationalized &#x201C;an hour&#x201D; as a 50-minute pomodoro. (My Toggl tracked time ended up near 24 hours.)</p><p>When analyzing the data, I controlled for minutes worked to get words per minute. I tracked my output in a few categories (words drafted, words outlined, words edited, and words proofed), which I adjusted to reflect roughly similar amounts of effort. E.g., words proofed counted as 1/10 as much effort as words drafted. I also gave my word count &#x201C;bonuses&#x201D; for other particularly useful work that wasn&apos;t reflected in word count, such as thinking hard on how to frame a tricky topic. I did these adjustments and bonuses before calculating totals to compare the days.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Here&#x2019;s what I found&#xA0;</strong></p><span><figure><img src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5ad8da815ffd20813824d475/1585103021621-SS9CR2C77GFZYURCA35E/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kO8z5qzvUIrbc_PdqFPjb6hZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWQUxwkmyExglNqGp0IvTJZUJFbgE-7XRK3dMEBRBhUpxSQsBnv65psZN1ZRxIyFAfHlLkGl0yVscnG40Uj8_d6TcrBOORllGMDIQGkLZzD_g/table.png?format=1000w"" class=""draft-image "" style=""width:40%""></figure></span><p>*I suspect my first day was more productive than normal (it was my most productive hour out of all 26). Given that, I&#x2019;ve included a conservative estimate below based on the other 1-hr day (750 words).</p><p><strong>UPDATE:</strong>  I did another experiment where I wrote for 1-3 hours per day for five days in a row. During that time, I averaged 727 words per hour. So, my measured output was quite close to my conservative estimate below. </p><span><figure><img src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5ad8da815ffd20813824d475/1585102381742-Z8TV3IMJAPLTULSQDFN9/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kLXP5y9--xHyBXfCvDFvA6tZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWQUxwkmyExglNqGp0IvTJZamWLI2zvYWH8K3-s_4yszcp2ryTI0HqTOaaUohrI8PI1Yq_mXisKabh6R4UF3q9899PvfYxbVU5wmy_R57m1hg/Words+per+hours+of+writing.png?format=1500w"" class=""draft-image "" style=""width:40%""></figure></span><p>According to this, increasing the hours worked by 4x only increased the words written by 2.2x, and increasing hours 8x resulted in 3.5x more words. These equal 54% and 43% as many words per hour respectively as when I only worked for one hour per day.&#xA0;</p><p>So while increasing hours still led to increased output, I got much less done per hour. I&#x2019;d be better off writing consistently for a few hours each day to efficiently maximize output.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>A few other observations&#xA0;</strong></p><p>Besides my main question of how working my hours affected my output, I noticed a few other observations that seemed noteworthy. However, these are post-hoc observations. Take them with an extra grain of salt - they might not replicate.&#xA0;</p><p><u>1. Go with the flow.</u> My output varied significantly by hour, but it didn&#x2019;t decrease linearly during the day. I had spikes throughout the eight-hour days.&#xA0;</p><p>However, the spikes were correlated with my subjective experience. (I drafted &gt;=750 words during 5 out of the 17 time blocks when feeling okay or good, but drafted that amount during 0 out of the 12 blocks when I felt blah.)</p><p>It worked best to do shallow work (such as proofing a transcription) or switch to a different piece when I felt stuck. My rule of thumb would be to stop if the writing isn&#x2019;t flowing after ten minutes, though I could see this being easy to <u><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/YtvZxRpZjcFNwJecS/the-importance-of-goodhart-s-law"">Goodhart</a></u> in the future.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p><p><u>2. Switch up work.</u> I scheduled my one-hour days for when I had the most calls. It ended up that I did a similar number of writing hours + coaching hours the first four days. Writing for one hour a day still felt easier than four hours even when the total hours spent working were similar. This weakly implies these limits may apply only to writing or maybe general deep work time.</p><p><u>3. Motivation matters, maybe.</u> I was tired of writing, and my <u><a href=""https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/repetitive-strain-injury-rsi/"">RSI</a></u> was flaring up, by midway through the second eight-hour day. I wouldn&#x2019;t be surprised if some of the slump in output was related to motivation. So, if someone really wanted to write for twelve hours a day, they might be just fine.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Conclusion </strong> </p><p>So, my data says I can do more than four hours even of deep work, but I&#x2019;m probably better off consistently writing for a few hours each day.&#xA0;</p><p>And I also think it&#x2019;s possible that all of that could be wrong. <u><a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/02/17/sleep-support-an-individual-randomized-controlled-trial/"">Did I notice a big effect because I expected a big effect?</a></u> Maybe. Was my sample size too small? Yeah. Were my methods susceptible to bias? Yes.&#xA0;</p><p>Do I know more than I did before this experiment? Definitely.&#xA0;</p><p>My prediction interval narrowed. Now, I would be quite surprised <em>not</em> to see more output from an eight-hour workday than from a four-hour workday even when I&#x2019;m doing deep work. I would also be quite surprised if I got more done per hour from the eight-hour than from a four-hour workday.&#xA0;</p><p>Both of these seemed unlikely but plausible before running the experiment.&#xA0;</p><span><figure><img src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5ad8da815ffd20813824d475/1585355171076-NIAA0DCG0HM7X77EPGZR/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kBXOnS_ckY-N0Nt3EgoT00hZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWQUxwkmyExglNqGp0IvTJZamWLI2zvYWH8K3-s_4yszcp2ryTI0HqTOaaUohrI8PIq4eCtsRbVJG-CkT_G2ER8zcUXVnKL9GpzVAoVsqPKFY/Prediction+interval+post.png?format=1500w"" class=""draft-image "" style=""width:40%""></figure></span><p>Even if I couldn&#x2019;t get to a final answer, I meaningfully reduced my uncertainty.&#xA0;</p><p>At least for myself. I don&#x2019;t expect these results to generalize widely. They might serve as a rough starting point, but much better to try it out yourself. You might have different types of work, different habits, and different levels of motivation - which could all lead to different results.&#xA0;</p><p>If you want to do a similar experiment, here are some questions to ask yourself:&#xA0;</p><ul><li>Did you crash the next day?&#xA0;</li><li>Did your work quality go down? How motivated were you?&#xA0;&#xA0;</li><li>How much of your top priority work did you complete in total? How much did you get done per hour?&#xA0;</li><li>How happy did you feel?

At least some have to be wrong or more nuanced, and it matters which are right.&#xA0;</p><p>I coach Effective Altruists who want to maximize the good they can do. So they want to know how much they can work before additional work is wasted (or just less valuable compared to extra time doing other things). They also want to know how much they can work before risking reducing their long-term productivity -- burning out from working too hard is a lose-lose for them and the world.&#xA0;</p><p>So, I dug into these questions to see if I could find an answer.&#xA0;</p><p>Short answer, there isn&#x2019;t a lot of good research on the topic. Long answer, our best data comes from World War One factory workers (turns out you can do interesting research when your research subjects aren&#x2019;t legally allowed to leave), but maybe we have enough information anyway to make educated guesses. At the least, we can run personal experiments.&#xA0;</p><p>Here&#x2019;s a summary of my findings and opinion, followed by the actual research.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p><p><strong>1. Limits on total hours. </strong>First, as you work more hours, each hour becomes less productive. If I had to guess based on the research, I&#x2019;d say there are steeply diminishing marginal value around 40-50 hours per week, and negative returns (meaning less total output for the day per additional hour) somewhere between 50 and 70 hours. But, this is based on a grand total of <em>two</em> data sets. World War One studies of factory workers are the only source that experimentally tests the question. They didn&#x2019;t even know to report sample sizes. (Also, a bunch of guys who wanted to prove workers should have Sunday off, found that having one day per week off was good. Give that as much credence as you think it&#x2019;s worth.) The other data set shows a similar, correlational trend between CEO hours and company sales.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>2. Limits on learning.</strong> Second, the spaced learning literature indicates that studying more than a few hours at a time may be useless. At least if you&#x2019;re trying to memorize information. On one topic. If you&#x2019;re producing output or switching up topics, this literature might be totally irrelevant. Still, it&#x2019;s important to consider if additional hours of hard work might be wasted. I can only imagine what the control group guys in one study thought; &#x201C;The guys studying four hours a day learned just a much as I did studying for seven? I worked my ass off an extra three hours a day for NOTHING?!?&#x201D; (Also worth noting, a <a href=""https://www.gwern.net/docs/spacedrepetition/1999-donovan.pdf"">meta-analysis</a> found that less rigorous studies had bigger effect sizes.) IF this literature applies to regular work, then it might be good to work on one priority for 1-4 hours a day, then switch to other topics.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>3. Anecdotal reports.</strong> I&#x2019;m fairly skeptical any of this research tells us how much to work (you can see more details below). I place more confidence on the anecdotal reports of <a href=""https://effectivealtruismcoaching.com/blog/2019/10/3/will-macaskill-on-his-eat-that-elephant-routine-learning-from-successful-people-and-the-diminishing-marginal-returns-of-time-spent-working"">productive</a> <a href=""https://effectivealtruismcoaching.com/blog/2019/11/2/niel-bowerman-on-goal-setting-hacking-motivation-and-80000-hours-bout-system"">people</a>. It&#x2019;s common for them to report three to five hours of deep work on a top priority each day, plus several hours more of lower energy or more &#x201C;following curiosity&#x201D;-type work (three more yet-to-be-released interviews also report in this range; one interview reports more). To be clear, I think they&#x2019;re describing consistent, intense, &#x201C;write a book chapter&#x201D; levels of focus for those three to five hours.&#xA0;</p><p>When people talk about working longer days (e.g. 12 hours), they usually report that it takes enough of a toll on subsequent days that it&#x2019;s not worth it. I know a number of people who consistently put in 8-12 hours of focused work a day, so it&#x2019;s possible. But most of these people are chronically stressed about their work. I&#x2019;m not sure if working a lot makes people stressed, or if stressed people work a lot to cope with the stress. Either way, I&#x2019;m hesitant to recommend people try to work this much.</p><p><strong>4. Long term sustainability. </strong>Additionally, limits to working hours might be necessary for long-term health and wellbeing, e.g. <a href=""https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/NDszJWMsdLCB4MNoy/burnout-what-is-it-and-how-to-treat-it"">avoiding burnout</a>. Setting aside vague &#x201C;balance&#x201D; like only working 40 hours a week (since you&#x2019;re probably not a World War One factory worker) - what do <em>you</em> need to stay sustainably healthy, happy, and productive? If you&#x2019;re unhappy, stressed, or tired, pay attention to this and <a href=""https://80000hours.org/career-guide/how-to-be-successful/#2-if-necessary-make-mental-health-your-top-priority"">check in</a> about your base needs such as sleep, exercise, social, and leisure time.&#xA0;</p><p>If you haven&#x2019;t before, try experimenting to see what makes you happy <em>and</em> productive at the same time. I didn&#x2019;t know I needed eight hours of sleep every night until I tracked my sleep, and it took me a while to notice that exercise made me happier and more productive the following day. If you&#x2019;re otherwise doing okay and want to make more time for productive work, you can try experimenting freeing up time in one area and see how that impacts you. If the change makes you feel worse, try something else instead. (It&#x2019;s <em>good</em> for you to be happy. Please believe me here.)</p><p><strong>5. Caveats. </strong>Additionally, I want to note that I still expect prioritization and deep work to be much more important than total hours spent working. E.g. if actions differ by 10x or more in importance regularly, then output is mostly determined by choosing the right things to work on, plus a smaller multiplier for time worked. In this case, having better processes for choosing the right work is way more important than hours spent working. Additionally, deep work in focused blocks is likely better for making progress on big priorities, so increasing deep work time is more important than total work time. Trying to work more hours may even be counter productive if you prioritize less (see <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30744810-the-five-hour-workday?from_search=true&amp;qid=KSUcr075sX&amp;rank=1"">The Five-Hour Workday</a> and <a href=""https://effectivealtruismcoaching.com/blog/2019/11/20/owen-cotton-barratt-on-prioritization-flow-and-making-time-for-shower-thoughts"">Owen&#x2019;s interview</a>).&#xA0;</p><p><strong>6. Individual Experiments. </strong>Finally, the best process may vary dramatically from individual to individual. This is obvious in extreme cases, such as people with extreme fatigue who can only work a few hours a day (if this is you, focus on addressing your fatigue first). So pay attention to yourself. Test what works for you.&#xA0;</p><p>I wrote up the results of a simple experiment I did on myself here. TLDR; I did one hour of deep work each day for two days, then two days of four hours each, and finally two days of eight hours each. I spend the entire 26 hours writing, and tracked how many words I wrote each hour to calculate the diminishing returns to big blocks.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p><p>You can fairly easily do a similar experiment to play with your personal limits.&#xA0;</p><p>If you want to do more, here are some other experiments you might find valuable:&#xA0;</p><ul><li>Remember that feeling productive and actually accomplishing valuable work might be separate. If you don&apos;t already, you may need to <strong>track how much you work and your goals/output</strong> so you have a baseline for what you get done before you can meaningfully run experiments. Rough metrics are fine - reducing uncertainty is better than throwing your hands up. If you&#x2019;re not sure what output to measure, here are some ideas: time spent on priorities, deep work time, writing pace and quality, novel ideas, difficulty of problem you can solve, amount of coding or bugs, emails answered. These are all rough, so try a couple and see which feel like they&#x2019;re correlated with what you care about.&#xA0;</li><li>Does having a <strong>full day off</strong> once a week help? Do you see a noticeable difference when you take a day off with zero work vs still checking email, etc.?&#xA0;</li><li>Energy and focus also often change throughout the day - <strong>is there a particular schedule that works well for you</strong>? Are you more likely to get high quality, focused work done in the morning, afternoon, or evening? I estimate I&#x2019;m about four times more productive in my peak work sessions than when I&#x2019;m tired, which I know because I track my working time on Toggl.com and evaluated my writing output from a few blocks of time spent writing when I felt tired and when I felt energized.&#xA0;</li><li><strong>Are breaks, walks, or naps helpful?</strong> In particular, taking breaks to check you&#x2019;re working efficiently is a good way to avoid wasting big blocks of time.&#xA0; E.g. pause every hour to check that you used the time to push forward your priority with the least <a href=""http://mindingourway.com/half-assing-it-with-everything-youve-got/"">wasted motion</a> possible. If not, then make a better plan for the next hour to nail your goal.</li><li><strong>Do you need bigger breaks periodically?</strong> If you push yourself for a while, do you hit a wall and need to take a few days to recharge? If so, what does it feel like when you hit a wall and what ways are best for you to recharge?&#xA0;</li></ul><p>And remember, you&#x2019;re finding what works for <em>you</em> here.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>7. Conclusion.</strong> So, to the effective altruists who want to push their ability to do more so they can have a bigger impact and to the effective altruists who want EAs to cut themselves some slack before they burn out -- you both have a valid point. We don&#x2019;t know how much a motivated person at peak performance can work. It might be a lot more than four hours a day. It might not.&#xA0;</p><p>If you run the experiments and find ways that you can work more efficiently or more hours, great! As long as you&#x2019;re still good. If you&#x2019;re regularly stressed and unhappy about your work, that should be a big red flag. You burning out will not help your cause. (P.s. your happiness matters too.) In that case, it might be good to work less - at least temporarily - to force yourself to be more efficient and thoughtful about your work.</p><p><em>If you just wanted the high-level overview, feel free to stop here! The rest is the nitty gritty of the studies I looked at.&#xA0;</em></p><p><em>______________________________________________________</em></p><h2><strong>1. Diminishing returns on total time spent working&#xA0;</strong></h2><p>To start with, I recommend Elizabeth Van Nostrand&#x2019;s epistemic spot check on <a href=""https://acesounderglass.com/2019/06/21/epistemic-spot-check-the-role-of-deliberate-practice-in-the-acquisition-of-expert-performance/"">The Role of Deliberate Practice in the Acquisition of Expert Performance</a>, the basis for Newport&#x2019;s claims about deep work time. His claim is among the more commonly cited reasons for believing people can only work so much. In turn, he cites Ericsson, Krampe, and Tesch-R&#xF6;mer&#x2019;s 1993 paper, <a href=""http://projects.ict.usc.edu/itw/gel/EricssonDeliberatePracticePR93.pdf"">The Role of Deliberate Practice in the Acquisition of Expert Performance</a>.&#xA0;</p><p>Elizabeth concludes, &#x201C;Many of the studies were criminally small, and typically focused on singular, monotonous tasks like responding to patterns of light or memorizing digits. The precision of these studies is greatly exaggerated. There&#x2019;s no reason to believe Ericsson, Krampe, and Tesch-R&#xF6;mer&#x2019;s conclusion that the correct number of hours for deliberate practice is 3.5, much less the commonly repeated factoid that humans can do good work for 4 hours/day.&#x201D;</p><p>I wanted to go beyond this pitiful citation trail. So, the following are the studies I dug up to see whether there was actually good evidence out there. You can jump back to the first page if you want to hear the summary of how, no, there&#x2019;s really not much good evidence available.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p><p><strong>1. Time-use diary study of CEOs</strong></p><p>I found one dataset that seemed relevant to diminishing returns on output per hour worked doing thought work. It was a <a href=""https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/31/5/1605/4708267#115347067"">study of CEOs&apos; time use</a>, with data collected by phone calls with the CEOs&#x2019; personal assistants to reconstruct the CEOs&#x2019; days, which used company sales as the &#x201C;output&#x201D; measure.&#xA0;</p><p>According to the study, among 1,114 CEOs, a 10% increase in weekly hours worked was associated with a 3.3% increase in company productivity. The CEOs worked an average of 52 hours per week. It doesn&#x2019;t say if or when additional hours worked become negatively correlated with productivity.&#xA0;</p><p>I briefly looked at the data set (<a href=""https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/31/5/1605/4708267#supplementary-data"">obtained here</a>). Take my analysis with a huge grain of salt &#x2013; this is from eyeballing one graph. The scatter plot on hours worked and company sales (without controlling for anything) trended toward more hours worked correlating with more sales but there wasn&#x2019;t a clear pattern, and a LOESS curve flattened shortly after 40 hours per week. This weakly inclined me to think the data set supports a positive relationship between more hours worked and more total output, with diminishing returns per additional hour after about 40 or 45 hours per week. I decided it wasn&#x2019;t worth my time right now to buy SPSS and play around with the data set a bunch more, but I would be very interested in the results if someone else felt like doing so.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>2. Studies of factory workers in World War One</strong></p><p>The main dataset I saw cited for supporting diminishing marginal returns is a collection of studies done during World War One, mostly on factory munitions workers. The studies support that general conclusion to a limited degree, but take them with a big grain of salt: the sample sizes were generally not given but probably &#x201C;criminally small&#x201D;, the study quality was probably bad given it was done a hundred years ago, and it&#x2019;s unclear that factory work generalizes to thought work. In so far as these studies generalize, they would support working &lt;50 hours per week and taking one entire day off per week to rest.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p><p>I hunted down <a href=""https://www.gwern.net/docs/psychology/1968-welford-fundamentalsofskill.pdf"">Fundamentals of Skill, Welford (1968)</a> (cited in the deliberate practice paper) and found what seems to be the most relevant passage: &#x201C;Presumptive evidence of some kind of fatigue effect during an industrial shift is contained in the classical reports of the Industrial Fatigue Research Board (later renamed Industrial Health Research Board). These reports showed not only that shorter working shifts led to higher hourly output (Osborne, 1919, Vernon, 1919), but also that a net reduction in working hours could sometimes lead to a net rise in total output (Vernon, 1920a, b).&#x201D; (p.282)</p><p>I tracked down <a href=""https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nnc1.cu06339174&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=18"">Vernon 1920a</a> (since this was the only paper cited for the claim that a net reduction in working hours could sometimes lead to a net rise in total output). The paper supports both claims, but only at a factory-level (not individual-level) for the net reduction in productivity.&#xA0;</p><p>Reducing shifts from 8 to 4 hours increased output per hour by 11.5%, and reducing shifts from 8 to 6 hours increased output per hour by 4.7-10.6%. The factory could use more men for more, shorter shifts, so the total working time was nearly constant (2 hours less total for the 6-hour shifts). So in cases where more workers are unavailable (such as most thought work), working the extra hours would result in more total output even if lower hourly output.&#xA0;</p><p>Next, I read a review of the rest of research on munitions workers (<a href=""http://ftp.iza.org/dp8129.pdf"">Pencavel, 2014</a>). Pencavel found that total output increased with each additional hour until 63 hours per week, then decreased with additional hours worked. Average output per hour decreased above 49 hours per week. In addition, holding hours per week constant, having one day off is about 10% better than working seven shorter days. (I&#x2019;m additionally skeptical of this finding because it felt like the researchers were trying to prove that having Sunday off was worthwhile.) Between the diminishing marginal output and the benefit of a day off, working 48 hours per week across six days resulted in slightly more output than working 70 hours per week across seven days. So, capping work time at 50 hours per week would have resulted in little lost output. Finally, they claim the rate at which additional hours of work becomes less productive varies across workers and across types of work.&#xA0;</p><h2><strong>2. Diminishing returns on time spent learning&#xA0;</strong></h2><p>The numbers on hours of deep work time might have originated in the literature on spaced learning. It&#x2019;s well studied that learning via <a href=""https://www.gwern.net/Spaced-repetition"">spaced repetition is more efficient and effective than massed studying</a> (e.g. cramming for a test). Below, I summarize the spaced learning studies that the deliberate practice paper cited, directly or indirectly via citing a reference in another work, plus another study from a meta-analysis that had particularly long-term tests for retention.&#xA0;</p><p>These studies do seem to support diminishing returns on time spent learning in one day. According to these studies, studying one hour per day, spaced out over more days, might shave a quarter or more off the total time required to learn a given thing, compared to studying for 2 or more hours per day. So more calendar time but fewer hours of studying. This <a href=""https://www.gwern.net/docs/www/uweb.cas.usf.edu/f1052ecdd92f0ecc3f57bdd890a4a6558483ec45.pdf"">meta-analysis</a> suggested the benefit of spaced learning compared to massed as 15% on average, which might be a more realistic expectation.&#xA0;</p><p>Still, there are a couple reasons this literature might not generalize to time spent working.</p><p>First, spaced learning might only be relevant when memorizing new skills or material, e.g. if the benefit is due to how memories are formed. I also didn&#x2019;t see anything on how the benefit of spaced learning would change as one becomes an expert &#x2013; contrary to Newport&#x2019;s claims that the amount of deep work done per day increases from one to four hours as one becomes an expert. (I suspect his claim is more likely to relate to one&#x2019;s ability to stay motivated and focused instead.) </p><p>Second, even when relevant, it seems like the spaced learning benefit is for one topic, not all work done in a day. For example, the participants in the army study below did other things after their four hours of studying. In that case, a good rule of thumb would be to only work/learn on one subject for a limited number of hours, but you could study something else later in the day.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p><p><strong>1. Telegraphy army study</strong></p><p>From Elizabeth&#x2019;s <a href=""https://acesounderglass.com/2019/06/21/epistemic-spot-check-the-role-of-deliberate-practice-in-the-acquisition-of-expert-performance/"">review</a>: &#x201C;An interesting army study showing that students given telegraphy training for 4 hours/day (and spending [the rest] on other topics) learned as much as students studying 7 hours/day. This one seems genuinely relevant, although not enough to tell us where peak performance lies, just that four hours are better than seven. Additionally, the students weren&#x2019;t loafing around for the excess three hours: they were learning other things. So this is about how long you can study a particular subject, not total learning capacity in a day.&#x201D;</p><p>The students studying for 4 hours per day spent an additional three weeks doing so, and ended up &#x201C;markedly superior&#x201D;. Breaking the four-hour period into four one-hour periods didn&#x2019;t give further improvement.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>2. Postmen learning to type</strong></p><p><a href=""https://www.gwern.net/docs/spacedrepetition/1978-baddeley.pdf"">The Influence of Length and Frequency of Training Session on the Rate of Learning to Type, Baddeley &amp; Longman (1978)</a></p><p>Study on learning to type: &quot;Four groups of postmen were trained to type alpha-numeric code material using a conventional typewriter keyboard. Training was based on sessions lasting for one or two hours occurring once or twice per day.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p>It took the people studying 2 x 2 (two hours per session, two sessions per day) 49.7 hours on average to learn the keyboard range, while the people doing 1 x 1 only took 34.9 hours. It took fewer days to study in mass (12 instead of 35), but the per hour learning was less efficient.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>3. Assembly line training task </strong></p><p>A second passage from <a href=""https://www.gwern.net/docs/psychology/1968-welford-fundamentalsofskill.pdf"">Fundamentals of Skill</a> referred to training session length, though again apparently in a factory setting: &#x201C;A further, as yet unanswered, question is raised by the problem of optimum length of training session. It is clear that there are severe limits to the rate at which material can be learnt when considered on a time scale of seconds and minutes, but are there any additional limitations operating over periods of hours, days or even longer times? Common experience suggests that there may be, but the question does not seem to have been posed in a scientific context. An indication that it might be worth asking is contained in the finding by Henshaw and Holman (1933) in an industrial study, that 8o min training per day at a chain assembly task yielded as rapid improvement as 160 min.&#x201D; I was unable to find the original study. </p><p><strong>4. Learning a foreign language&#xA0;</strong></p><p><a href=""https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1994-08385-001"">Bahrick, H. P., Bahrick, L. E., Bahrick, A. S., &amp; Bahrick, P. E. (1993). Maintenance of foreign language vocabulary and the spacing effect. Psychological Science, 4, 316&#x2013;321.</a></p><p>Another small study that I saw found: &#x201C;Four adults (aged 25&#x2013;57 yrs at the beginning of the study) learned and relearned 300 English&#x2013;foreign language word pairs. Either 13 or 26 relearning sessions were administered at intervals of 14, 28, or 56 days. Retention was tested for 1, 2, 3, or 5 yrs after training terminated. The longer intersession intervals slowed down acquisition slightly, but this disadvantage during training was offset by higher retention. 13 retraining sessions spaced at 56 days yielded retention comparable to 26 sessions spaced at 14 days.&#x201D;&#xA0;&#xA0;</p><p>And that&#x2019;s all folks. I hope you had fun reading the blog equivalent of a null finding.&#xA0;</p>",lynettebye,lynettebye,lynettebye,

These interviews were originally intended to focus narrowly on reasons for optimism, but we ended up covering a variety of topics, including AGI timelines, the likelihood of current techniques leading to AGI, and what the right things to do in AI safety are right now.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>We talked to Ernest Davis, Paul Christiano, Rohin Shah, Adam Gleave, and Robin Hanson.<br></p>

<p><strong>Relative optimism in AI often comes from the belief that AGI will be developed gradually, and problems will be fixed as they are found rather than neglected.</strong></p>



<p>All of the researchers we talked to seemed to believe in non-discontinuous takeoff.<span id='easy-footnote-1-2350' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://aiimpacts.org/takeaways-from-safety-by-default-interviews/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-2350' title='Paul Christiano: &lt;a href=&quot;https://sideways-view.com/2018/02/24/takeoff-speeds/&quot;&gt;https://sideways-view.com/2018/02/24/takeoff-speeds/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rohin Shah: “I don’t know, in a world where fast takeoff is true, lots of things are weird about the world, and I don’t really understand the world. So I’m like, “Shit, it’s quite likely something goes wrong.” I think the slow takeoff is definitely a crux. Also, we keep calling it slow takeoff and I want to emphasize that it’s not necessarily slow in calendar time. It’s more like gradual. … Yeah. And there’s no discontinuity between… you’re not like, “Here’s a 2X human AI,” and a couple of seconds later it’s now… Not a couple of seconds later, but like, “Yeah, we’ve got 2X AI,” for a few months and then suddenly someone deploys a 10,000X human AI. If that happened, I would also be pretty worried. It’s more like there’s a 2X human AI, then there’s like a 3X human AI and then a 4X human AI. Maybe this happens from the same AI getting better and learning more over time. Maybe it happens from it designing a new AI system that learns faster, but starts out lower and so then overtakes it sort of continuously, stuff like that.”&lt;br&gt;&amp;#8212; From &lt;a href=&quot;https://aiimpacts.org/conversation-with-rohin-shah/&quot;&gt;Conversation with Rohin Shah&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Adam Gleave: “I don&amp;#8217;t see much reason for AI progress to be discontinuous in particular. So there&amp;#8217;s a lot of empirical records you could bring to bear on this, and it also seems like a lot of commercially valuable interesting research applications are going to require solving some of these problems. You&amp;#8217;ve already seen this with value learning, that people are beginning to realize that there&amp;#8217;s a limitation to what we can just write a reward function down for, and there&amp;#8217;s been a lot more focus on imitation learning recently. Obviously people are solving much narrower versions of what the safety community cares about, but as AI progresses, they&amp;#8217;re going to work on broader and broader versions of these problems.”&lt;br&gt;&amp;#8212; From &lt;a href=&quot;https://aiimpacts.org/conversation-with-adam-gleave/&quot;&gt;Conversastion with Adam Gleave&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Robin Hanson: “That argument was a very particular one, that this would appear under a certain trajectory, under a certain scenario. That was a scenario where it would happen really fast, would happen in a very concentrated place in time, and basically once it starts, it happens so fast, you can’t really do much about it after that point. So the only chance you have is before that point. … But I was doubting that scenario. I was saying that that wasn’t a zero probability scenario, but I was thinking it was overestimated by him and other people in that space. I still think many people overestimate the probability of that scenario. Over time, it seems like more people have distanced themselves from that scenario, yet I haven’t heard as many substitute rationales for why we should do any of this stuff early.” &lt;br&gt;&amp;#8212; From &lt;a href=&quot;https://aiimpacts.org/conversation-with-robin-hanson/&quot;&gt;Conversation with Robin Hanson&lt;/a&gt;'><sup>1</sup></a></span> Rohin gave ‘problems will likely be fixed as they come up’ as his primary reason for optimism,<span id='easy-footnote-2-2350' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://aiimpacts.org/takeaways-from-safety-by-default-interviews/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-2350' title='“The first one I had listed is that continual or gradual or slow takeoff, whatever you want to call it, allows you to correct the AI system online.

&lt;p&gt;“And then, I also have optimism that yes, the AI research community is going to try to solve these problems. It&amp;#8217;s not like people are just completely disinterested in whether their systems cause harm, it&amp;#8217;s just that right now, it seems to a lot of people very premature to work on this. There&amp;#8217;s a sense of ‘how much good can we do now, where nearer to the time there&amp;#8217;s going to just be naturally 100s of times more people working on the problem?’. I think there is still value you can do now, in laying the foundations of the field, but that maybe gives me a bit of a different perspective in terms of thinking, ‘What can we do that&amp;#8217;s going to be useful to people in the future, who are going to be aware of this problem?’ versus ‘How can I solve all the problems now, and build a separate AI safety community?’.”&lt;br&gt;&amp;#8212; From &lt;a href=&quot;https://aiimpacts.org/conversation-with-adam-gleave/&quot;&gt;Conversation with Adam Gleave&lt;/a&gt;'><sup>3</sup></a></span> and Paul<span id='easy-footnote-4-2350' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://aiimpacts.org/takeaways-from-safety-by-default-interviews/#easy-footnote-bottom-4-2350' title='“Before we get to resources or people, I think one of the basic questions is, there’s this perspective which is fairly common in ML, which is like, ‘We’re kind of just going to do a bunch of stuff, and it’ll probably work out’. That’s probably the basic thing to be getting at. How right is that?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the bad view of safety conditioned on– I feel like prosaic AI is in some sense the worst– seems like about as bad as things would have gotten in terms of alignment. Where, I don’t know, you try a bunch of shit, just a ton of stuff, a ton of trial and error seems pretty bad. Anyway, this is a random aside maybe more related to the previous point. But yeah, this is just with alignment. There’s this view in ML that’s relatively common that’s like, we’ll try a bunch of stuff to get the AI to do what we want, it’ll probably work out. Some problems will come up. We’ll probably solve them. I think that’s probably the most important thing in the optimism vs pessimism side.”&lt;br&gt;&amp;#8212; From &lt;a href=&quot;https://aiimpacts.org/conversation-with-paul-christiano/&quot;&gt;Conversation with Paul Christiano&lt;/a&gt;'><sup>4</sup></a></span> both mentioned it as a reason.<br></p>



<p>Relatedly, both Rohin<span id='easy-footnote-5-2350' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://aiimpacts.org/takeaways-from-safety-by-default-interviews/#easy-footnote-bottom-5-2350' title='“I think I could imagine getting more information from either historical case studies of how people have dealt with new technologies, or analyses of how AI researchers currently think about things or deal with stuff, could change my mind about whether I think the AI community would by default handle problems that arise, which feels like an important crux between me and others.”&lt;br&gt;&amp;#8212; From &lt;a href=&quot;https://aiimpacts.org/conversation-with-rohin-shah&quot;&gt;Conversation with Rohin Shah&lt;/a&gt;'><sup>5</sup></a></span> and Paul<span id='easy-footnote-6-2350' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://aiimpacts.org/takeaways-from-safety-by-default-interviews/#easy-footnote-bottom-6-2350' title='“One can learn… I don’t know very much about any of the relevant institutions, I may know a little bit. So you can imagine easily learning a bunch about them by observing how well they solve analogous problems or learning about their structure, or just learning better about the views of people. That’s the second category.”&lt;br&gt;&amp;#8212; From &lt;a href=&quot;https://aiimpacts.org/conversation-with-paul-christiano/&quot;&gt;Conversation with Paul Christiano&lt;/a&gt;'><sup>6</sup></a></span> said one thing that could update their views was gaining information about how institutions relevant to AI will handle AI safety problems&#8211; potentially by seeing them solve relevant problems, or by looking at historical examples.<br></p>



<p>I think this is a pretty big crux around the optimism view; my impression is that MIRI researchers generally think that 1) the development of human-level AI will likely be fast and potentially discontinuous and 2) people will be incentivized to hack around and redeploy AI when they encounter problems. See <a href=""https://aiimpacts.org/likelihood-of-discontinuous-progress-around-the-development-of-agi/#Intelligence_explosion"">Likelihood of discontinuous progress around the development of AGI</a> for more on 1). I think 2) could be a fruitful avenue for research; in particular, it might be interesting to look at recent examples of people in technology, particularly ML, correcting software issues, perhaps when they’re against their short-term profit incentives. Adam said he thought the AI research community wasn’t paying enough attention to building safe, reliable, systems.<span id='easy-footnote-7-2350' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://aiimpacts.org/takeaways-from-safety-by-default-interviews/#easy-footnote-bottom-7-2350' title='“And then, if I look at the state of the art in AI, there&amp;#8217;s a number of somewhat worrying trends. We seem to be quite good at getting very powerful superhuman systems in narrow domains when we can specify the objective that we want quite precisely. So AlphaStar, AlphaGo, OpenAI Five, these systems are very much lacking in robustness, so you have some quite surprising failure modes. Mostly we see adversarial examples in image classifiers, but some of these RL systems also have somewhat surprising failure modes. This seems to me like an area the AI research community isn&amp;#8217;t paying much attention to, and I feel like it&amp;#8217;s almost gotten obsessed with producing flashy results rather than necessarily doing good rigorous science and engineering. That seems like quite a worrying trend if you extrapolate it out, because some other engineering disciplines are much more focused on building reliable systems, so I more trust them to get that right by default.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even in something like aeronautical engineering where safety standards are very high, there are still accidents in initial systems. But because we don&amp;#8217;t even have that focus, it doesn&amp;#8217;t seem like the AI research community is going to put that much focus on building safe, reliable systems until they&amp;#8217;re facing really strong external or commercial pressures to do so. Autonomous vehicles do have a reasonably good safety track record, but that&amp;#8217;s somewhere where it&amp;#8217;s very obvious what the risks are. So that&amp;#8217;s kinda the sociological argument, I guess, for why I don&amp;#8217;t think that the AI research community is going to solve all of the safety problems as far ahead of time as I would like.”&lt;br&gt;&amp;#8212; From &lt;a href=&quot;https://aiimpacts.org/conversation-with-adam-gleave/&quot;&gt;Conversation with Adam Gleave&lt;/a&gt;'><sup>7</sup></a></span><br></p>



<p><strong>Many of the arguments I heard around relative optimism weren’t based on inside-view technical arguments.</strong></p>



<p>This isn’t that surprising in hindsight, but it seems interesting to me that though we interviewed largely technical researchers, a lot of their reasoning wasn’t based particularly on inside-view technical knowledge of the safety problems. See <a href=""https://aiimpacts.org/interviews-on-plausibility-of-ai-safety-by-default/"">the interviews</a> for more evidence of this, but here’s a small sample of the not-particularly-technical claims made by interviewees:</p>

I also don&amp;#8217;t see there being bags of compute falling out of the sky. Maybe if there was another AI winter, leading to a hardware overhang, then you might see sudden progress when AI gets funding again. But right now a lot of very well-funded organizations are spending billions of dollars on compute, including developing new application-specific integrated circuits for AI, so we&amp;#8217;re going to be very close to the physical limits there anyway.”&lt;br&gt;&amp;#8212; From &lt;a href=&quot;https://aiimpacts.org/conversation-with-adam-gleave/&quot;&gt;Conversation with Adam Gleave&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“A key idea here would be we&amp;#8217;re getting AI progress over time, and how lumpy it is, is extremely directly relevant to these estimates.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For example, if it was maximally lumpy, if it just shows up at one point, like the Foom scenario, then in that scenario, you kind of have to work ahead of time because you&amp;#8217;re not sure when. There&amp;#8217;s a substantial&amp;#8230; if like, the mean is two centuries, but that means in every year there&amp;#8217;s a 1-in-200 chance. There&amp;#8217;s a half-a-percent chance next year. Half-a-percent is pretty high, I guess we better do something, because what if it happens next year?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Okay. I mean, that&amp;#8217;s where extreme lumpiness goes. The less lumpy it is, then the more that the variance around that mean is less. It&amp;#8217;s just going to take a long time, and it&amp;#8217;ll take 10% less or 10% more, but it&amp;#8217;s basically going to take that long. The key question is how lumpy is it reasonable to expect these sorts of things. I would say, &amp;#8220;Well, let&amp;#8217;s look at how lumpy things have been. How lumpy are most things? Even how lumpy has computer science innovation been? Or even AI innovation?&amp;#8221;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think those are all relevant data sets. There&amp;#8217;s general lumpiness in everything, and lumpiness of the kinds of innovation that are closest to the kinds of innovation postulated here. I note that one of our best or most concrete measures we have of lumpiness is citations. That is, we can take for any research idea, how many citations the seminal paper produces, and we say, &amp;#8220;How lumpy are citations?&amp;#8221;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Interestingly, citation lumpiness seems to be field independent. Not just time independent, but field independent. Seems to be a general feature of academia, which you might have thought lumpiness would vary by field, and maybe it does in some more fundamental sense, but as it&amp;#8217;s translated into citations, it&amp;#8217;s field independent. And of course, it&amp;#8217;s not that lumpy, i.e. most of the distribution of citations is papers with few citations, and the few papers that have the most citations constitute a relatively small fraction of the total citations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That&amp;#8217;s what we also know for other kinds of innovation literature. The generic innovation literature says that most innovation is lots of little things, even though once in a while there are a few bigger things. For example, I remember there&amp;#8217;s this time series of the best locomotive at any one time. You have that from 1800 or something. You can just see in speed, or energy efficiency, and you see this point—.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not an exactly smooth graph. On the other hand, it&amp;#8217;s pretty smooth. The biggest jumps are a small fraction of the total jumpiness. A lot of technical, social innovation is, as we well understand, a few big things, matched with lots of small things. Of course, we also understand that big ideas, big fundamental insights, usually require lots of complementary, matching, small insights to make it work.”&lt;br&gt;&amp;#8212; From &lt;a href=&quot;https://aiimpacts.org/conversation-with-robin-hanson/&quot;&gt;Conversation with Robin Hanson&lt;/a&gt;'><sup>9</sup></a></span></li><li><em>Many technical problems feel intractably hard in the way that AI safety feels now, and still get solved within ~10 years.</em><span id='easy-footnote-10-2350' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://aiimpacts.org/takeaways-from-safety-by-default-interviews/#easy-footnote-bottom-10-2350' title='“The basic argument would be like, 1) On paper I don’t think we yet have a good reason to feel doomy. And I think there’s some basic research intuition about how much a problem– suppose you poke at a problem a few times, and you’re like ‘Agh, seems hard to make progress’. How much do you infer that the problem’s really hard? And I’m like, not much. As a person who’s poked at a bunch of problems, let me tell you, that often doesn’t work and then you solve in like 10 years of effort. &amp;#8230;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Like most of the time, if I’m like, ‘here’s an algorithms problem’, you can like– if you just generate some random algorithms problems, a lot of them are going to be impossible. Then amongst the ones that are possible, a lot of them are going to be soluble in a year of effort and amongst the rest, a lot of them are going to be soluble in 10 or a hundred years of effort. It’s just kind of rare that you find a problem that’s soluble– by soluble, I don’t just mean soluble by human civilization, I mean like, they are not provably impossible– that takes a huge amount of effort.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It normally… it’s less likely to happen the cleaner the problem is.

For one thing, you can just move around in the world and notice that it&amp;#8217;s three dimensional.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another thing is you can actually interact with stuff and see what the response is. So you can get causal intervention data, and that&amp;#8217;s probably where causality becomes such an ingrained part of us. So I could imagine that these things that we see as core to human reasoning, things like having a notion of causality or having a notion, I think apparently we&amp;#8217;re also supposed to have as babies an intuition about statistics and like counterfactuals and pragmatics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But all of these are done with brains that have been in the world for a long time, relatively speaking, relative to AI systems.

<p>My instinct when thinking about AGI is to defer largely to safety researchers, but these reasons felt noteworthy to me in that they seemed like questions that were perhaps better answered by economists or sociologists (or for the latter case, neuroscientists) than safety researchers. I really appreciated Robin’s efforts to operationalize and analyze the second claim above.<br><br>(Of course, many of the claims were also more specific to machine learning and AI safety.)<br></p>



<p><strong>There are lots of calls for individuals with views around AI risk to engage with each other and understand the reasoning behind&nbsp; fundamental disagreements.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>This is especially true around views that MIRI have, which many optimistic researchers reported not having a good understanding of.</p>



<p>This isn’t particularly surprising, but there was a strong universal and unprompted theme that there wasn’t enough engagement around AI safety arguments. Adam and Rohin both said they had a much worse understanding than they would like of others viewpoints.<span id='easy-footnote-12-2350' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://aiimpacts.org/takeaways-from-safety-by-default-interviews/#easy-footnote-bottom-12-2350' title='“I guess, I don&amp;#8217;t know if this is really useful, but I do wish I had a better sense of what other people in the safety community and outside of it actually thought and why they were working on it, so I really appreciate you guys doing these interviews because it&amp;#8217;s useful to me as well. I am generally a bit concerned about lots of people coming to lots of different conclusions regarding how pessimistic we should be, regarding timelines, regarding the right research agenda.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I think disagreement can be healthy because it&amp;#8217;s good to explore different areas. The ideal thing would be for us to all converge to some common probability distribution and we decide we&amp;#8217;re going to work on different areas. But it&amp;#8217;s very hard psychologically to do this, to say, ‘okay, I&amp;#8217;m going to be the person working on this area that I think isn&amp;#8217;t very promising because at the margin it&amp;#8217;s good’&amp;#8211; people don&amp;#8217;t work like that. It&amp;#8217;s better if people think, &amp;#8216;oh, I am working on the best thing, under my beliefs&amp;#8217;. So having some diversity of beliefs is good.

Seems to me there&amp;#8217;s just a lack of a conversation here. Early on, Eliezer Yudkowsky and I were debating, and then as soon as he and other people just got funding and recognition from other people to pursue, then they just stopped engaging critics and went off on pursuing their stuff.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Which makes some sense, but these criticisms have just been sitting and waiting. Of course, what happens periodically is they are most eager to engage the highest status people who criticize them. So periodically over the years, some high-status person will make a quip, not very thought out, at some conference panel or whatever, and they&amp;#8217;ll be all over responding to that, and sending this guy messages and recruiting people to talk to him saying, &amp;#8220;Hey, you don&amp;#8217;t understand.

Since this is outside of my expertise and I haven't been following all of the recent research, I'm passing the questions along here.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are looking for some valid research on the use of commercial products for face masks. We have a couple of designs that can fit over or have  a pocket to insert an additional filter. I have found multiple sources online that refer to furnace filters, air filtration system filters, even HEPA vacuum bags, as ideal products to use to either completely comprise a face mask or be inserted into a pocket between layers of fabric to provide extra protection.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>My questions are:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>•	Which of these products are or are not safe to be breathing through? The only caution I have found is to be careful to check for fiberglass in the content.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>•	Which are most effective, or does it come down to the MERV/MRP rating? We have been looking at filters at MERV 13-16 and/or MRP 2500-2800 in range. Are these safe as long as they can be breathed through?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>•	Can these types of materials be layered to provide extra protection i.e. is layering two ply of MERV 11 like a MERV 22 or is there a loss ratio? Is there a formula which can be applied?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>•	Could other materials be used to enhance the filter’s effectiveness, safety, smell, etc.? I have seen models that added an activated charcoal filter over the top, coffee filter, etc.? I have also heard that layers create a dispersion effect that increases the protective factor i.e. a thick bundled knitted scarf has a higher protective factor because of the density.</p>

Our </span>

<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/solar-one-year-in"">solar install</a> has shut itself
down after detecting an arc fault four times since we installed it
eighteen months ago: 2019-03-24, 2019-04-10, 2019-08-17, and
2020-02-17.  The 2019-04-10 shutdown was with error code 4301 while
the other three were with code 8206.  Per the 

<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/SBxx-US-1XP-40-BA-en-13.pdf"">manual</a> for our SunnyBoy 5.0
inverter, these codes are:



</p><p>

</p>

<blockquote>

4301: The inverter has detected an electric arc. The inverter
interrupts grid feed-in and cannot connect to the utility grid.
<p>
8206: The inverter has detected an electric arc and was recommissioned
after a disconnection.

</p>

<p>

The inverter can take up to three strings, and ours is configured with
two.  A sensible inverter would track which of the strings the arc
fault had been on, to help narrow down the problem, but apparently
this one doesn't.  The techs decided to turn off one of the two
strings, and see if the fault re-occurs.  Based on four faults in 18m,
with the longest interval of 6m, you'd need to wait about 8m with no
faults before being pretty sure the problem was with the disconnected
string.  This seems like a long time to be producing at half capacity,
but apparently inspecting an installation on a steep roof to locate an
arc fault is very difficult?  This doesn't make much sense to me, but
also I don't know much about it and kind of need to take the techs'
word for things.

This post is about some problems facing this effort and some possible solutions. To explain these problems, I'll take the view that the agents deployed by AI developers (the ''principals'') in a multipolar scenario are <em>moves in a game</em>. The payoffs to a principal in this game depend on how the agents behave over time. We can talk about the equilibria of this game, and so on. Ideally, we would be able to make guarantees like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>The payoffs resulting from the deployed agents' actions are optimal with respect to some appropriate ""welfare function''. This welfare function would encode some combination of total utility, fairness, and other social desiderata;</li>
<li>The agents are in equilibrium --- that is, no principal has an incentive to deploy an agent with a different design, given the agents deployed by the other principals.</li>
</ol>
<p>The motivation for item 1 is clear: we want outcomes which are fair by each of the principals' lights. In particular, we want an outcome that the principals will all agree to. And item 2 is desirable because an equilibrium constitutes a self-enforcing contract; each agent wants to play their equilibrium strategy, if they believe that the other agents are playing the same equilibrium. Thus, given that the principals all say that they will deploy agents that satisfy 1 and 2, we could have some confidence that a welfare-optimal outcome will in fact obtain.</p>
<p>Two simple but critical problems need to be addressed in order to make such
guarantees: the equilibrium and prior selection problems. The <strong>equilibrium selection problem</strong> is that this deployment game will have many equilibria. Even if the principals agree on a welfare function, it is possible that many different profiles of agents optimize the same welfare function. So the principals
need to coordinate on the profile of agents deployed in order to make guarantees
like 1 and 2. Moreover, the agents will probably have private information, such as information about their payoffs, technological capabilities, and so on. As I will explain below, conflicting priors about private information can lead to suboptimal outcomes. And we can’t expect agents to arrive at the same priors by default.
So a <strong>prior selection problem</strong> also has to be solved.</p>
<p>The equilibrium selection problem is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equilibrium_selection"">well-known</a>. The prior selection problem is discussed less. In games where agents have uncertainty about some aspect of their counterparts (like their utility functions), the standard solution concept ---
<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_game#Bayesian_Nash_equilibrium"">Bayesian Nash equilibrium</a> ---
requires the agents to have a common prior over the possible values of the players' private information. This assumption might be very useful for some kinds of economic modeling, say. But we cannot expect that AI agents deployed by different principals will have the same priors over private information --- or even common knowledge of each others' priors --- in all of their interactions, in the absence of coordination<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-c9tXqtLWdjFoQ9nyz-1"" id=""fnref-c9tXqtLWdjFoQ9nyz-1"">[1]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>It might be unnatural to think about coordinating on a prior; aren't your priors your beliefs? How can you change your beliefs without additional evidence?
But there may be many reasonable priors to have, especially for a boundedly
rational agent whose ""beliefs'' are (say) some complicated property of a neural network. This may be especially true when it comes to beliefs about other agents' private information, which is something that's particularly difficult to
learn about from observation (see <a href=""https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7803-occams-razor-is-insufficient-to-infer-the-preferences-of-irrational-agents.pdf"">here</a> for example). And while there may be many reasonable priors to have, incorrect beliefs about others' priors could nonetheless have large downsides<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-c9tXqtLWdjFoQ9nyz-2"" id=""fnref-c9tXqtLWdjFoQ9nyz-2"">[2]</a></sup>. I give an example of the risks associated with disagreeing priors later in the post.</p>
<p>Possible solutions to these problems include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Coordination by the principals to build a single agent;</li>
<li>Coordination by the principals on a profile of agents which are in a welfare-optimal equilibrium;</li>
<li>Coordination by the principals on procedures for choosing among equilibria and specifying a common prior at least in certain high-stakes interactions between their agents (e.g., interactions which might escalate to destructive conflict).</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, a simple but important takeaway of the game-theoretic perspective on multipolar AI deployment is that <em>it is not enough to evaluate the safety of an agent's behavior in isolation from the other agents that will be deployed</em>. Whether an agent will behave safely depends on how other agents are designed to interact, including their notions of fairness and how they form beliefs about their counterparts. This is more reason to promote coordination by AI developers, not just on single-agent safety measures but on the game theoretically-relevant aspects of their agents' architectures and training.</p>

</ul>
<p>The equilibrium and prior selection problems need to be solved to make such guarantees. I'll talk about these in the next two subsections.</p>
<h4>The equilibrium selection problem</h4>
<p>For a moment, consider the reward functions for a different game: an asymmetric version of Chicken (Table 1)<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-c9tXqtLWdjFoQ9nyz-3"" id=""fnref-c9tXqtLWdjFoQ9nyz-3"">[3]</a></sup>.
Suppose players 1 and 2 play this game infinitely many times.
The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_theorem_(game_theory)"">folk theorems</a> tell us that there a Nash equilibrium of this repeated game for every profile of long-run average payoffs in which each player gets at least as much as they can guarantee themselves unilaterally (<span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""-1.5""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.298em; padding-bottom: 0.446em;"">−</span></span><span class=""mjx-mn""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">1.5</span></span></span></span></span></span> for player 1 and <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""-1""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.298em; padding-bottom: 0.446em;"">−</span></span><span class=""mjx-mn""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">1</span></span></span></span></span></span> for player 2). Any such payoff profile can be attained in equilibrium by finding a sequence of action profiles that generates the desired payoffs, and then threatening long strings of punishments for players who deviate from this plan. This is a problem, because it means that if a player wants to know what to do, it's not sufficient to play a Nash equilibrium strategy. They could do arbitrarily badly if their counterpart is playing a strategy from a <em>different</em> Nash equilibrium.</p>
<p>So, if we want to guarantee that the players don't end up playing lots of <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""(D, D)""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">(</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">D</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""margin-top: -0.144em; padding-bottom: 0.519em;"">,</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi MJXc-space1""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">D</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">)</span></span></span></span></span></span>'s, it is not enough to look at the properties of a <em>single</em> player. For instance, in the case of AI, suppose there are two separate AI teams independently training populations of agents. Each AI team wants to teach their agents to behave ""fairly"" in some sense, so they train them until they converge to an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionarily_stable_strategy"">evolutionary stable strategy</a>
in which some ""reasonable'' welfare function is maximized. But, these populations will likely be playing different equilibria. So disaster could still arise if agents from the two populations are played against
each other<sup class=""footnote-ref""><a href=""#fn-c9tXqtLWdjFoQ9nyz-4"" id=""fnref-c9tXqtLWdjFoQ9nyz-4"">[4]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Then how do players choose among these equilibria, to make sure that they're playing strategies from the same one? It helps a lot if the players have an opportunity to coordinate on an equilibrium before the game starts, as the principals do in our multipolar AI deployment model.</p>

<p>One intuitively fair solution would be alternating between <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""(C, D)""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">(</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.045em;"">C</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""margin-top: -0.144em; padding-bottom: 0.519em;"">,</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi MJXc-space1""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">D</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">)</span></span></span></span></span></span> and <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""(D, C)""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">(</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">D</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""margin-top: -0.144em; padding-bottom: 0.519em;"">,</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi MJXc-space1""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.045em;"">C</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">)</span></span></span></span></span></span> at each step. This would lead to player 1 getting an average payoff of 1.75 and player 2 getting an average payoff of 0.5. Another solution might be arranging moves such that the players get the same payoff (equal to about <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""0.9""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mn""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">0.9</span></span></span></span></span></span>), which in this case would mean playing twelve <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""(C, D)""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">(</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.045em;"">C</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""margin-top: -0.144em; padding-bottom: 0.519em;"">,</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi MJXc-space1""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">D</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">)</span></span></span></span></span></span>'s for every seven <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""(D, C)""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">(</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">D</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""margin-top: -0.144em; padding-bottom: 0.519em;"">,</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi MJXc-space1""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.045em;"">C</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">)</span></span></span></span></span></span>'s. Or,
player 2 might think they can demand more because they can make player 1 worse-off than player 1 can make them. But, though they may come to the bargaining table with differing notions of fairness, both players have an interest in
avoiding coordination failures. So there is hope that the players would reach some agreement, given a chance to coordinate before the game.</p>
<p>Likewise, the learning game introduced above is a complex sequential game --- its payoffs are not known at the outset, but can be learned over time.
And this game will also have different equilibria that correspond to different notions of fairness. One solution is for the principals to coordinate on a set of learning algorithms which jointly maximize a welfare function <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""w""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">w</span></span></span></span></span></span> and punish deviations from this optimization plan, in order to incentivize cooperation. I discuss this approach <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/4GuKi9wKYnthr8QP9/sections-5-and-6-contemporary-architectures-humans-in-the"">in example 5.1.1 here</a> and <a href=""https://longtermrisk.org/files/toward_cooperation_learning_games_oct_2020.pdf"">in this draft</a>.</p>
<p>The problem of enforcement is avoided if the principals coordinate to build a single agent, of course. But it's not clear how likely this is to happen, so it seems important to have solutions which require different degrees of cooperation by
the principals. On the other hand, what if the principals are not even able to fully coordinate on the choice of learning algorithms? The principals could at least coordinate on bargaining procedures that their agents will use in the highest-stakes encounters. Such an arrangement could be modeled as specifying a welfare function for measuring the fairness of different proposals in high-stakes interactions, and specifying punishment mechanisms for not following the deal that is maximally fair according to this function. Ensuring that this kind of procedure leads to efficient outcomes also requires agreement on how to form credences in cases where agents possess private information. I address this next.</p>
<h4>The prior selection problem</h4>
<p>In this section, I'll give an example of the risks of noncommon priors. In this example, agents having different beliefs about the credibility of a coercive threat leads to the threat being carried out.</p>
<p>Bayesian Nash equilibrium (BNE) is the standard solution concept for games of
<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_information"">incomplete information</a>, i.e., games in which the players have some private information. (An agent's private information often corresponds to their utility function. However, in my example below it's more intuitive to specify the private information differently.) In this formalism, each player <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""i""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">i</span></span></span></span></span></span> has a set of possible ""types'' <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\tau_i""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base"" style=""margin-right: -0.08em;""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.08em;"">τ</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mi"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">i</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> encoding their private information.

<p>To illustrate the importance of coordination on a common prior, suppose that two agents find themselves in a high-stakes interaction under incomplete information.

agent 2 (Threatener) tells agent 1 (Target) that they will carry out some dire threat
if Target doesn't transfer some amount of resources to them. However, it is uncertain whether the Threatener has actually committed to carrying out such a threat.</p>
<p>Say that Threatener is a Commitment type if they can commit to carrying out the threat, and a Non-Commitment type otherwise. To compute a BNE, the agents need to specify a common prior for the probability that Threatener is a Commitment type. But, without coordination,
they may in fact specify different values for this prior. More precisely, define</p>

<p>How might the agents agree on a common prior?

<p>Again, full coordination on a pair of learning algorithms might be unrealistic. But it still might be possible to agree beforehand on a method for specifying a common prior in certain high-stakes situations. Because of incentives to misrepresent one's credences, it might not be enough to agree to have agents just report their credences and (say) average them (in this case e.g. Target would want to understate
their credence that Threatener is a Commitment type). One direction is to have an agreed-upon standard for measuring the fit of different credences to mutually observed data.

<p>I won't try to answer the question of how agents decide, in a particular
interaction, whether they should use some ""prior commonification''
mechanism. To speculate a bit, the decision might involve higher-order priors. For instance, if Threatener has a higher-order prior over <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""p_{Ta}""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.446em;"">p</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-texatom"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.12em;"">T</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">a</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> and thinks that there's a sufficiently high chance that inequality (1) holds, then they
might think they're better off coordinating on a prior. But, developing a
principled answer to this question is a direction for future work.</p>

The agents might not only have disagreeing priors, but model their strategic interaction using different games entirely. I hope to address this in a later post. For simplicity I'll focus on the special case of priors here. Also, see the literature on ""hypergames"" (e.g. Bennett, P.G., 1980.

might play off-equilibrium (seeing as humans are ""suboptimal''). But the problem is not just that one of the players might play off-equilibrium.

This is apparently the closest thing we currently have to a national strategic plan for the United States.</p><p>The plan operates in three broad phases, plus one bonus phase:</p><p><strong>Phase I: Slow the Spread.</strong> Current phase of the response, where the US has widespread school closures, work-from-home, close malls and gyms, and limit restaurants. This is intended to stay in place until transmission has measurably slowed down and health infrastructure has scaled up.</p><p><strong>Phase II: State-by-State Reopening.</strong> Individual states are able to move to Phase II as they are identified to be able to safely diagnose, treat, and isolate COVID-19 cases and contacts. Testing must be scaled up rapidly. These states can gradually reopen schools and businesses, but will likely need to maintain some degree of physical distancing and limitations on larger gatherings. Older adults will also need to remain at home.</p><blockquote>The trigger for issuing a stay-at-home advisory in a US state is when case counts are doubling every three to five days (based on the current New York experience) or when state and local officials recommend it based on the local context (for example, growth on track to overwhelm the health system&#x2019;s capacity). The trigger for issuing a recommendation to step down from a stay-at-home-advisory back to &#x201C;slow the spread&#x201D; is when the number of new cases reported in a state has declined steadily for 14 days (i.e., one incubation period) and the jurisdiction is able to test everyone seeking care for COVID-19 symptoms.</blockquote><p><strong>Phase III: Lifting restrictions</strong>. Phase III will also be gradually reached on a state-by-state basis &#x201C;once a vaccine has been developed, has been tested for safety and efficacy, and receives FDA emergency use authorization&#x201D; OR &#x201C;there are other therapeutic options that can be used for preventive or treatment indications and that have a measurable impact on disease activity and can help rescue very sick patients&#x201D;.</p><p><strong>Phase IV: Rebuild Readiness for the Next Pandemic</strong>. Phase III is basically returning to normal, so that makes Phase IV more of a wishlist for what to do after things are normal to not get in this mess again. The report asks for greater vaccine development capacity to reduce time-to-vaccine below one year, improve the hospital surge capacity to be able to rapidly scale ICUs if needed in the future, improve disease forecasting, and move policy away from decentralized response.</p><p>~</p><p><u><a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/bill-gates-heres-how-to-make-up-for-lost-time-on-covid-19/2020/03/31/ab5c3cf2-738c-11ea-85cb-8670579b863d_story.html"">Bill Gates: &#x201C;Here&#x2019;s how to make up for lost time on COVID-19&#x201D;</a></u>:</p><ol><li>consistent nationwide approach to shutting down</li><li>step up on testing</li><li>clear priorities for who is tested (prioritize health-care workers and first responders, followed by highly symptomatic people who are most at risk of becoming seriously ill and those who are likely to have been exposed)</li><li>allocate masks and ventilators nationally, not by having each state compete</li><li>don&apos;t speculate about treatments - run rapid trials involving various candidates and inform the public when the results are in</li><li>start building the infrastructure to make vaccines now</li></ol><p>~</p><p><u><a href=""https://twitter.com/LHSummers/status/1244802597246193673"">Lawrence Summers summarizes the key policies</a></u>: &#x201C;I think we need to be investing, in a way far beyond what we are, in developing an infrastructure for widespread testing, widespread contact tracing, and widespread separation of those who are sick and those who are most vulnerable&#x201D;</p><p>~</p><p>A bit more on China, misreporting, the Principal-Agent Problem, and Goodhart&#x2019;s Law from the New York Times: <u><a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/29/world/asia/coronavirus-china.html"">&#x201C;China Created a Fail-Safe System to Track Contagions.

Scarred by the SARS epidemic that erupted in 2002, China had created an infectious disease reporting system that officials said was world-class: fast, thorough and, just as important, immune from meddling.</blockquote><blockquote>Hospitals could input patients&#x2019; details into a computer and instantly notify government health authorities in Beijing, where officers are trained to spot and smother contagious outbreaks before they spread.</blockquote><blockquote>It didn&#x2019;t work.</blockquote><blockquote>After doctors in Wuhan began treating clusters of patients stricken with a mysterious pneumonia in December, the reporting was supposed to have been automatic. Instead, hospitals deferred to local health officials who, over a political aversion to sharing bad news, withheld information about cases from the national reporting system &#x2014; keeping Beijing in the dark and delaying the response.</blockquote><p>China continues to have an issue of people not wanting to report bad news to higher-ups.</p><p>~</p><p>Another issue with creating good plans is when they aren&#x2019;t followed at all.

The project was driven by career civil servants as well as political appointees, aware that global leaders had initially fumbled their response to the 2014-2015 spread of Ebola and wanting to be sure that the next response to an epidemic was better handled.</blockquote><blockquote>The Trump administration was briefed on the playbook&#x2019;s existence in 2017, said four former officials, but two cautioned that it never went through a full, National Security Council-led interagency process to be approved as Trump administration strategy. [...]</blockquote><blockquote>A health department spokesperson also said that the NSC playbook was not part of the current coronavirus strategy. [...]</blockquote><blockquote>Trump has claimed that his administration could not have foreseen the coronavirus pandemic, which has spread to all 50 states and more than 180 nations, sickening more than 460,000 people around the world. &#x201C;Nobody ever expected a thing like this,&#x201D; Trump said in a Fox News interview on Tuesday.</blockquote><blockquote>But Trump&#x2019;s aides were told to expect a potential pandemic, ranging from a tabletop exercise that the outgoing Obama administration prepared for the president&#x2019;s incoming aides to a &#x201C;Crimson Contagion&#x201D; scenario that health officials undertook just last year and modeled out potential risks of a global infectious disease threat. Trump&#x2019;s deputies also have said that their coronavirus response relies on a federal playbook, specifically referring to a strategy laid out by the Centers for Disease Control.</blockquote><blockquote>It is not clear if the administration&#x2019;s failure to follow the NSC playbook was the result of an oversight or a deliberate decision to follow a different course.&#x201C;</blockquote><p>Similarly, <u><a href=""https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2020-03-28/ebola-should-have-immunized-united-states-coronavirus"">the US should have learned important lessons from the Ebola response that it seems to have not</a></u>:</p><blockquote>In international crises, policymakers and politicians rarely have a dress rehearsal before their debut on the main stage. Yet in retrospect, the Ebola outbreak of 2013&#x2013;15 amounts to exactly that&#x2014;a real-life test of Washington&#x2019;s ability to detect and contain an infectious disease that threatens global security. [...]</blockquote><blockquote>It was clear to those who responded to the Ebola outbreak that the response system of the United States and the international response system would risk collapse if faced with a more dire scenario. It was equally clear that a more dire scenario taking place was a question of when, not if. [...]</blockquote><blockquote>Even before the Ebola epidemic ended, the U.S. government began pursuing a three-pronged strategy to contain a more dangerous outbreak. First, it doubled down on the Global Health Security Agenda, an initiative the Obama administration launched before the Ebola crisis to expand capabilities around the world to prevent, detect, and rapidly respond to infectious disease threats. [...] The strategy&#x2019;s second prong was to further build out the network of hospitals and testing centers in the United States designated to treat Ebola and to increase the size of the national medical stockpile with more of the personal protective equipment and materials needed to fight highly lethal pathogens. The third prong was to designate a health emergency response coordinator and create a new Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense within the National Security Council. [...]</blockquote><blockquote>As 2017 turned to 2018 and 2018 turned to 2019, each prong of this strategy fell away like wheels off a bus. When the money provided by the Ebola Response Supplemental ran out, the new administration continued to fund the Global Health Security Agenda. But the overall budget for the Centers for Disease Control was cut, and no robust, new investments were made in greater deployable capability in the United States or other countries. At home, the envisioned expansion of the original 35-hospital Ebola Treatment Network did not take place; the $259 million appropriated for the network in 2014 was not followed by meaningful infusions of funds, setting it on track to expire in May 2020 and leading the Department of Health and Human Services to warn in November 2017 that &#x201C;the current capacity of this system is not likely to be sufficient for many types of infectious disease outbreaks (e.g., pandemic influenza and other respiratory pathogens).&#x201D; Nor was the national medical stockpile significantly bolstered. Congressional leaders passed budgets that had none of the vision or scale of the $5.4 billion Ebola Response Supplemental.</blockquote><blockquote>The third prong of the strategy was the last to go. In his first month as National Security Adviser, John Bolton shuttered the new NSC Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense. Its leader departed the NSC staff just one day after the WHO declared a new outbreak of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of the Congo that to date has killed over 5,000 people.&#x201D;</blockquote><p>~</p><p><u><a href=""https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/03/28/social-distancing-is-a-privilege/"">We in the developed world should keep in mind that social distancing is a privilege that will be much harder to maintain in the developing world</a></u>: &#x201C;In neighboring Dharavi, Asia&#x2019;s largest slum with a population of 1 million in an area of less than a square mile, workers laughed when I asked them if they had been practicing social distancing.

We examine the magnitude of the critical parameters that would lead to negative net benefits. A key unknown factor is the time to economic recovery with and without social distancing measures in place.

We &#xFB01;nd that absent extensive suppression measures, the economic cost of the virus will total over $9 trillion, which represents 43% of annual GDP. The optimal duration of the suppression policy crucially depends on the policy&#x2019;s effectiveness in reducing the rate of the virus transmission. We use three different assumptions for the suppression policy effectiveness, measured by the R0 that it can achieve (R0 indicates the number of people an infected person infects on average at the start of the outbreak). Using the assumption that the suppression policy can achieve R0 = 1, we assess that it should be kept in place between 30 and 34 weeks. If suppression can achieve a lower R0 = 0.7, the policy should be in place between 11 and 12 weeks. Finally, for the most optimistic assumption that the suppression policy can achieve an even lower R0 of 0.5, we estimate that it should last between seven and eight weeks. We further show that stopping the suppression policy before six weeks does not produce any meaningful improvements in the pandemic outcome.</blockquote><br><h3>Now Just What are the Tech Overlords up to?</h3><p><u><a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/white-house-announces-new-partnership-unleash-u-s-supercomputing-resources-fight-covid-19/"">A new COVID-19 High Performance Computing Consortium</a></u> brings together the US government, IBM, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Hewlett Packard, MIT, NASA, and others to &#x201C;provide COVID-19 researchers worldwide with access to the world&#x2019;s most powerful high performance computing resources that can significantly advance the pace of scientific discovery in the fight to stop the virus&#x201D;.</p><p>~</p><p><u><a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/01/palantir-coronavirus-cdc-nhs-gotham-foundry/"">Palantir provides COVID-19 tracking software to CDC and NHS, pitches European health agencies</a></u>&#x2026; but it will probably be ok?<br></p><blockquote>Palantir, a secretive government-friendly big data operation that&#x2019;s able to ingest vast amounts of information to visualize trends and track individuals &#x2014; useful tasks as the spread of COVID-19 threatens to overwhelm healthcare systems and ravage economies.</blockquote><blockquote>In mid-March, The Wall Street Journal reported that Palantir was working with the CDC to model the potential spread of the virus.

<p>Our question was when it would be feasible to ‘outperform professional game testers on all Atari games using no game specific knowledge’.<span id='easy-footnote-1-2351' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://aiimpacts.org/atari-early/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-2351' title='



&lt;p&gt;Full question wording:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;How many years until you think the following AI tasks will be feasible with:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;a small chance (10%)?
an even chance (50%)?
a high chance (90%)?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let a task be ‘feasible’ if one of the best resourced labs could implement it in less than a year if they chose to. Ignore the question of whether they would choose to.&lt;/p&gt;



[…]



&lt;p&gt;Outperform professional game testers on all Atari games using no game-specific knowledge. This includes games like Frostbite, which require planning to achieve sub-goals and have posed problems for deep Q-networks1,2.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;1 Mnih et al. (2015). Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning
2 Lake et al. (2015). Building Machines That Learn and Think Like People&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;small chance (10%)&lt;br&gt; even chance (50%)&lt;br&gt; high chance (90%)'><sup>1</sup></a></span> &#8216;Feasible&#8217; was defined as meaning that one of the best resourced labs could do it in a year if they wanted to.</p>



<p>As I see it, there are four non-obvious things to resolve in determining whether this task has become feasible:</p>



<ul><li>Did or could they outperform ‘professional game testers’? </li><li>Did or could they do it ‘with no game specific knowledge’?</li><li>Did or could they do it for ‘all Atari games’?</li><li>Is anything wrong with the result?</li></ul>



<p><strong>I. Did or could they outperform ‘professional game testers’?</strong></p>



<p>It looks like yes, for at least for 49 of the games: the &#8216;human baseline&#8217; seems to have come specifically from professional game testers.<span id='easy-footnote-2-2351' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://aiimpacts.org/atari-early/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-2351' title='&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14236&quot;&gt;This paper&lt;/a&gt; seems to describe measuring the &amp;#8216;human baseline&amp;#8217;, in particular: &amp;#8220;The professional human tester used the same emulator engine as the agents, and played under controlled conditions. The human tester was not allowed to pause, save or reload games. As in the original Atari 2600 environment, the emulator was run at 60 Hz and the audio output was disabled: as such, the sensory input was equated between human player and agents. The human performance is the average reward achieved from around 20 episodes of each game lasting a maximum of 5min each, following around 2 h of practice playing each game.&amp;#8221;'><sup>2</sup></a></span> What exactly the comparison was for the other games is less clear, but it sounds like what they mean by &#8216;human baseline&#8217; is &#8216;professional game tester&#8217;, so probably the other games meet a similar standard.</p>



<p><strong>II. Did or could they do it with ‘no game specific knowledge’?</strong></p>



<p>It sounds like their system does not involve &#8216;game specific knowledge&#8217;, under a reasonable interpretation of that term. </p>



<p><strong>III. Did or could they do it for ‘all Atari games’?</strong></p>



<p>Agent57 only plays 57 <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_2600"">Atari 2600</a> games, whereas <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Atari_2600_games"">there are hundreds</a> of Atari 2600 games (and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_XEGS"">other</a> <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_7800"">Atari</a> <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_Jaguar"">consoles</a> with presumably even more games). </p>



<p>Supposing that Atari57 is a longstanding benchmark including only 57 Atari games, it seems likely that the survey participants interpreted the question as about only those games. Or at least about all Atari 2600 games, rather than every game associated with the company Atari.</p>



<p>Interpreting it as written though, does Agent57&#8217;s success suggest that playing all Atari games is now feasible? My guess is yes, at least for Atari 2600 games. </p>



<p>Fifty-five of the fifty-seven games were proposed in <a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1207.4708.pdf"">this paper</a><span id='easy-footnote-3-2351' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://aiimpacts.org/atari-early/#easy-footnote-bottom-3-2351' title='Section 3.1.2, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1207.4708.pdf&quot;&gt;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1207.4708.pdf&lt;/a&gt;'><sup>3</sup></a></span>, which describes how they chose fifty of them:  </p>



<blockquote class=""wp-block-quote""><p>Our testing set was constructed by choosing semi-randomly from the 381 games listed on Wikipedia [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Atari_2600_games (July 12, 2012)] at the time of writing. Of these games, 123 games have their own Wikipedia page, have a single player mode, are not adult-themed or prototypes, and can be emulated in ALE. From this list, 50 games were chosen at random to form the test set.</p></blockquote>



<p>The other five games in that paper were a &#8216;training set&#8217;, and I&#8217;m not sure where the other two came from, but as long as fifty of them were chosen fairly randomly, the provenance of the last seven doesn&#8217;t seem important.</p>



<p>My understanding is that none of the listed constraints should make the subset of games chosen particularly easy rather than random. So being able to play these games well suggests being able to play any Atari 2600 game well, without too much additional effort.</p>



<p>This might not be true if having chosen those games (about eight years ago), systems developed in the meantime are good for this particular set of games, but a different set of methods would have been needed had a different subset of games been chosen, to the extent that more than an additional year would be needed to close the gap now. My impression is that this isn&#8217;t very likely.</p>



<p>In sum, my guess is that respondents usually interpreted the ambiguous &#8216;all Atari games&#8217; at least as narrowly as Atari 2600 games, and that a well resourced lab could now develop AI that played all Atari 2600 games within a year (e.g. plausibly DeepMind could already do that).</p>



<p><strong>IV. Is there anything else wrong with it?</strong></p>



<p>Not that I know of.</p>



<p class=""has-text-align-center"">~</p>



<p>Given all this, I think it is more likely than not that this Atari task is feasible now. Which is interesting, because the <a href=""https://aiimpacts.org/2016-expert-survey-on-progress-in-ai/#Answers-9"">median 2016 survey response</a> put a 10% chance on it being feasible in five years, i.e. by 2021.<span id='easy-footnote-4-2351' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://aiimpacts.org/atari-early/#easy-footnote-bottom-4-2351' title='Though note that only 19 participants answered the question about when there was a 10% chance. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We surveyed 352 machine learning researchers publishing at top conferences, asking each a random subset of many questions. Some of these questions were about when they expected thirty-two concrete AI tasks would become ‘feasible’. We asked each of those questions in two slightly different ways. The relevant Atari questions had 19 and 20 responses for the two wordings, only one of which gave an answer for 2021.'><sup>4</sup></a></span> They more robustly put a median 50% chance on ten years out (2026).<span id='easy-footnote-5-2351' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://aiimpacts.org/atari-early/#easy-footnote-bottom-5-2351' title='Half the time we asked about chances in N years, and half the time we asked about years until P probability, and people fairly consistently &lt;a href=&quot;https://aiimpacts.org/chance-date-bias/&quot;&gt;had earlier distributions&lt;/a&gt; when asked the second way. Both methods yielded a 50% chance in ten years here, though later the distributions diverge, with a 90% chance in 15 years yet a 60% chance in 20 years. Note that small numbers of different respondents answered each question, so inconsistency is not a huge red flag, though the consistent inconsistency across many questions is highly suspicious.'><sup>5</sup></a></span>



<p>It&#8217;s exciting to start resolving expert predictions about early tasks so we know more about how to treat their later predictions about human-level science research and the obsolescence of all human labor for instance.

In controlling my </span>

<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/news/jammer"">rhythm stage setup</a> I have
been bringing instruments in and out by pressing buttons on my 

<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/axis-49-initial-thoughts"">axis 49</a>.  It has plenty of
buttons, but needing to press them with my fingers doesn't combine
well with playing mandolin.  So: toe buttons!



</p><p>

The most common tool musicians use seems to be the <a href=""https://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/FCB1010--behringer-midi-foot-controller-fcb1010"">FCB1010</a>.
Not only does it have twelve buttons it has two expression pedals.
While this would be nice, it's too bulky for me: I already have many
things under my feet so I would need to move my feet too far to press
the buttons.  So I built something instead:

<p>

This is my <a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/footboard-v3"">footboard v3</a> with its four
velocity sensitive pads, but now with six multi-color switches within
easy reach of my toes.  It's velcroed on to the main section and
connects via USB:

</p>

<p>

I made it out of <a href=""https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07SVTQ7B9/"">momentary
push-button switches</a> and a <a href=""https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00UUROWWK/"">DIY arcade
kit</a>.  It presents as a USB game controller, and I've modified my
software to read from it with IOKit calls (<code><a href=""https://github.com/jeffkaufman/jammer/commit/110743b4e3e180c3007a977725b84c2532ddc7d8"">110743b4e</a></code>).

</p>

<p>

I cut a block of wood to the right size, leaving the tops of the
buttons even with the footrest, cut a piece of plexiglass to match,
and cut through them both with a bit the same diameter as the barrel
of the switches.  Then I drilled a smaller hole into that cavity for
the signal wire to come out.  Here's two of the switches in place:

</p>

<p>

I built a small box to house the USB controller out of 3/4 plywood.  I
didn't glue the top on, in case I later want to open it up to add
leads for additional switches.  Here's the external wiring:

</p>

<p>

I've only just set it up, but being able to bring things in and out
without stopping my mandolin (both hands), kick drum (left foot), or
<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/trying-a-breath-controller"">breath controller</a> (mouth)
is really great!

</p>

<p>

Currently I'm only using the ""press"" and ignoring the ""release"", but
I'd like to make ""press and hold"" be a different signal.  Possibly I'd
like something where a short press activate a mode, another short
press deactivates the mode, but a press-and-hold activates the mode
just for as long as it's held down?

Find all Alignment Newsletter <strong><a href=""http://rohinshah.com/alignment-newsletter/"">resources here</a></strong>. In particular, you can look through <strong><a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PwWbWZ6FPqAgZWOoOcXM8N_tUCuxpEyMbN1NYYC02aM/edit?usp=sharing"">this spreadsheet</a></strong> of all summaries that have ever been in the newsletter.</p><p>Audio version <strong><a href=""http://alignment-newsletter.libsyn.com/alignment-newsletter-93"">here</a></strong> (may not be up yet). 			  </p><h1>HIGHLIGHTS </h1><p><strong><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Precipice-Existential-Risk-Future-Humanity/dp/0316484911"">The Precipice: Existential Risk and the Future of Humanity</a></strong> <em>(Toby Ord)</em> (summarized by Rohin): This book argues that humanity is in a special stage of its development: it is on the <em>precipice</em>, a narrow time during which we have enough power to destroy ourselves, but not enough wisdom to have mitigated such risks. It first argues that existential risk would be very important to reduce (for all the standard reasons), and then considers many different kinds of existential risks, finding that natural ones (asteroids, supervolcanoes, stellar explosions) are small relative to anthropogenic risks, both current (nuclear war, climate change, environmental destruction) and future (engineered pandemics, unaligned AI, dystopian scenarios). I&apos;ll focus primarily on the part about AI risk, as well as some of the comments on existential risk in general.</p><p>The AI risk presentation in the book was similar to that in <strong><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Superintelligence-Dangers-Strategies-Nick-Bostrom/dp/1501227742"">Superintelligence</a></strong>: it argues for risk from goal-directed AI systems (though the terminology used in the book is different). It first demonstrates the strong progress in deep learning, and then notes that expert surveys estimate that AGI is more likely than not to arrive in the next century. It then notes that we don&apos;t know how to specify a reward function for an AI system (even with e.g. inverse reinforcement learning), and to the extent that we get it wrong, it pits us in competition against a superintelligent adversary. Ideas like switching off the AI system wouldn&apos;t work, due to convergent instrumental subgoals like survival.</p><p>It also considers some obvious objections, including the very reasonable objection that &quot;AI researchers won&apos;t build something that will kill them&quot;. However, Toby is still worried, citing that due to the unilateralist curse unaligned AGI might still be built by the most optimistic researchers, and in any case the personal benefits to the researchers might justify the risk of misalignment to them personally (though it would not be justified for the world as a whole).</p><p>The book then spends some time discussing <em>risk factors</em>, which are things that do not <em>directly</em> lead to existential risks, but indirectly <em>exacerbate</em> other existential risks, making them more likely. For example, great power war seems like a risk factor: it isn&apos;t going to cause an existential catastrophe by itself, but it increases the likelihood that we use risky technologies like bioweapons and AI that could then cause an existential catastrophe.</p><p>The book also has lots of useful insights about existential risks in general, which then also apply to AI risk: for example, risks that strike sooner should be prioritized (since the later risks can be dealt with later), risks that are more sudden will be more important to focus on (since we won&apos;t be able to build support as the risk gradually comes in), and risks that are &quot;sharper&quot; will be more neglected since there won&apos;t be as many &quot;warning shots&quot;.</p><p><strong>Read more:</strong> <strong><a href=""https://futureoflife.org/2020/03/31/he-precipice-existential-risk-and-the-future-of-humanity-with-toby-ord/"">FLI Podcast: The Precipice: Existential Risk and the Future of Humanity with Toby Ord</a></strong></p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> I enjoyed this book more than I thought I would: it had a lot of novel content for me, and I liked the explanations and comparisons across different kinds of existential risks (something that I hadn&apos;t really seen a single unified perspective on), and I especially liked the constant focus on what we do and don&apos;t know -- it felt more like a research paper (albeit in a conversational style) than a popular book, and was similarly information-dense.</p><p>On the AI part specifically, I liked that one of the endnotes cashed out powerful AI systems using model-based RL: this indeed seems like the thing that is closest to the classic expected utility maximizer, so the conclusions make a bit more sense. You still have to wonder how exactly the model is learned, and how exactly the AI system becomes good at using the model to find good actions, but at least under those two assumptions you would have all the standard convergent instrumental subgoals. In contrast, with model-free RL, the default expectation is that the RL agent needs to try things multiple times before it can learn to do them again, so it&apos;s less clear how it starts doing novel things. It seems that model-based and model-free RL are pretty similar so the distinction doesn&apos;t matter in practice, but at least conceptually it&apos;s a lot easier to reason about the model-based system (at least in the context of AI risk).</p><p>Toby gives a 1 in 10 chance of existential catastrophe from AI in the next century (more than half of his total of 1 in 6), which decomposes into a 1 in 2 chance of AGI this century, and 1 in 5 of it leading to existential catastrophe. This is a bit more pessimistic than Paul&apos;s <strong><a href=""https://aiimpacts.org/conversation-with-paul-christiano/"">estimate</a></strong> (<strong><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/b3dc916ac7e2/an-80-why-ai-risk-might-be-solved-without-additional-intervention-from-longtermists"">AN #80</a></strong>) of 10% EV loss (which was over all time, not just this century), which is in turn a bit more pessimistic than the 1 in 10 chance that I <strong><a href=""https://aiimpacts.org/conversation-with-rohin-shah/"">estimated</a></strong> (<strong><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/b3dc916ac7e2/an-80-why-ai-risk-might-be-solved-without-additional-intervention-from-longtermists"">AN #80</a></strong>) (and am now forever anchored on), which was over all time <em>and</em> conditional on no additional effort from longtermists. But I wouldn&apos;t read too much into this -- 10 is a nice round number, and that probably played a big role in why I chose it. I certainly don&apos;t feel calibrated enough to easily tell the difference between 1 in 5 and 1 in 20 on a question of this complexity.</p><p>I am very happy about this trend of people actually stating numbers: it&apos;s a lot easier to narrow down on the important disagreements when people put down numbers, even if they&apos;re completely made up. I&apos;d really like to see numbers from people who have larger disagreements (as I expect would be the case with e.g. MIRI researchers).</p><h1>TECHNICAL AI ALIGNMENT </h1><h2>LEARNING HUMAN INTENT </h2><p><strong><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/k8F8TBzuZtLheJt47/deconfusing-human-values-research-agenda-v1"">Deconfusing Human Values Research Agenda v1</a></strong> <em>(G Gordon Worley III)</em> (summarized by Rohin): This post argues that since 1. human values are necessary for alignment, 2. we are confused about human values, and 3. we couldn&apos;t verify it if an AI system discovered the structure of human values, we need to do research to become less confused about human values. This research agenda aims to deconfuse human values by modeling them as the input to a decision process which produces behavior and preferences. The author&apos;s best guess is that human values are captured by valence, as modeled by <strong><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/Cu7yv4eM6dCeA67Af/minimization-of-prediction-error-as-a-foundation-for-human"">minimization of prediction error</a></strong>.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> This is similar to the argument in <strong><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/zvrZi95EHqJPxdgps/why-we-need-a-theory-of-human-values"">Why we need a <em>theory</em> of human values</a></strong> (<strong><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/6751e45fbb48/alignment-newsletter-36"">AN #36</a></strong>), and my opinion remains roughly the same: I strongly agree that we are confused about human values, but I don&apos;t see an understanding of human values as necessary for value alignment. We could hope to build AI systems in a way where we don&apos;t need to specify the ultimate human values (or even a framework for learning them) before running the AI system. As an analogy, my friends and I are all confused about human values, but nonetheless I think they are more or less aligned with me (in the sense that if AI systems were like my friends but superintelligent, that sounds broadly fine).</p><h2>INTERPRETABILITY </h2><p><strong><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/rSMbGFfsLMB3GWZtX/what-is-interpretability"">What is Interpretability?</a></strong> <em>(Robert Kirk et al)</em> (summarized by Rohin): This post categorizes several interpretability methods based on their <em>goal</em> and how they <em>enable humans</em> to achieve the goal.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> It&apos;s striking to me how different this is from other work, e.g. <strong><a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.09722"">Explicability? Legibility? Predictability? Transparency? Privacy? Security? The Emerging Landscape of Interpretable Agent Behavior</a></strong> (<strong><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/6751e45fbb48/alignment-newsletter-36"">AN #36</a></strong>). It seems like interpretability is a really vague, nebulous term that has so far (to my limited knowledge) not been made precise.</p><h2>ADVERSARIAL EXAMPLES </h2><p><strong><a href=""https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2020/03/27/attacks/"">Physically Realistic Attacks on Deep Reinforcement Learning</a></strong> <em>(Adam Gleave)</em> (summarized by Rohin): This is a blog post for a previously summarized paper, <strong><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10615"">Adversarial Policies: Attacking Deep Reinforcement Learning</a></strong> (<strong><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/732eaa192df0/an-70-agents-that-help-humans-who-are-still-learning-about-their-own-preferences"">AN #70</a></strong>).</p><h2>FORECASTING </h2><p><strong><a href=""https://aiimpacts.org/2019-recent-trends-in-gpu-price-per-flops/"">2019 trends in GPU price per FLOPS</a></strong> <em>(Asya Bergal)</em> (summarized by Rohin): This post analyzes the the trends in cost per FLOP for GPUs. There are a bunch of details in how to do this analysis, but they end up finding that this cost goes down by an order of magnitude over 17 years for single-precision FLOPS (halving time: 5 years), 10 years for half-precision FLOPS (halving time: 3 years), and 5 years for half-precision fused multiply-add FLOPS (halving time: 1.5 years). However, the latter two categories have become more popular in recent years with the rise of deep learning, so their low halving times might be because some of the single-precision hardware was converted to half-precision hardware, rather than fundamental technological improvements.</p><h2>MISCELLANEOUS (ALIGNMENT) </h2><p><strong><a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/knbhjv252HshMSwpt/p/gzWb5kWwzhdaqmyTt"">If I were a well-intentioned AI</a></strong> <em>(Stuart Armstrong)</em> (summarized by Rohin): This sequence takes on the perspective of an AI system that is well-intentioned, but lacking information about what humans want. The hope is to find what good AI reasoning might look like, and hopefully use this to derive insights for safety. The sequence considers Goodhart problems, adversarial examples, distribution shift, subagent problems, etc.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> I liked this sequence. Often when presented with a potential problem in AI safety, I ask myself why the problem doesn&apos;t also apply to humans, and how humans have managed to solve the problem. This sequence was primarily this sort of reasoning, and I think it did a good job of highlighting how with sufficient conservatism it seems plausible that many problems are not that bad if the AI is well-intentioned, even if it has very little information, or finds it hard to communicate with humans, or has the wrong abstractions.</p><h1>OTHER PROGRESS IN AI </h1><h2>DEEP LEARNING </h2><p><strong><a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.10657"">Coherent Gradients: An Approach to Understanding Generalization in Gradient Descent-based Optimization</a></strong> <em>(Satrajit Chatterjee)</em> (summarized by Nicholas): Deep neural networks trained with gradient descent do well at generalizing from their training set, but the field currently has relatively little understanding of why that is. Large networks have enough parameters to fully memorize the training set and can do so even if trained on data with entirely random labels. This allows for many functions that would fit the training set well, but not generalize, a phenomenon known as overfitting. The question is how gradient descent picks out one of a small subset of functions that will generalize well. </p><p>The <em>Coherent Gradients</em> hypothesis, introduced here and tested further in <strong><a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.07422"">this paper</a></strong>, is that this results from per-example gradients being averaged during gradient descent. For each example, some of the gradient points in a direction that is idiosyncratic to that example, but some of it points towards a more general solution. When the average is taken across these gradients, the more general directions reinforce each other while the example-specific directions cancel out. As a result, the training process moves faster towards more general directions.</p><p>In order to test this hypothesis, they run two experiments. First they use varying amounts of label noise (corrupting a fraction of the dataset to have random labels). They predict and find that:</p><p>1. More label noise leads to slower learning.</p><p>2. The uncorrupted examples will be learned faster.</p><p>The next experiment tests a novel form of regularization, called winsorization, where they clip the gradients on a per-example and per-parameter basis to prevent a single example from dominating the gradient, effectively curtailing the component of the gradient that is example-specific. Since the computation of per-example gradients is expensive, when scaling this up to larger networks, they instead use the median of 3 mini-batches to address outliers. The experiments suggest that winsorization reduces overfitting and in particular prevents neural nets from learning randomly labeled data.</p><p><strong>Read more:</strong> <strong><a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.07422"">Explaining Memorization and Generalization: A Large-Scale Study with Coherent Gradients</a></strong></p><p><strong>Nicholas&apos;s opinion:</strong> The hypothesis makes sense to me and the experiments do seem to bear out their conclusions. However, none of the results of the experiments were surprising to me and seem to me like they could be consistent with other explanations for generalization. I would be more convinced if the Coherent Gradients hypothesis made predictions that were different from other leading theories and then those turned out to be true.</p><h4><strong>FEEDBACK</strong></h4><p>I&apos;m always happy to hear feedback; you can send it to me, <strong><a href=""https://rohinshah.com/"">Rohin Shah</a></strong>, by <strong>replying to this email</strong>.                         </p><h4><strong>PODCAST</strong></h4><p>An audio podcast version of the <strong>Alignment Newsletter</strong> is available.

NcT9rRjSYpuQWDqFZ,The attack rate estimation is more important than CFR,the-attack-rate-estimation-is-more-important-than-cfr,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NcT9rRjSYpuQWDqFZ/the-attack-rate-estimation-is-more-important-than-cfr,2020-04-01T16:23:12.674Z,10,4,3,False,False,,"<p>Let&#x2019;s here define the &#x201C;attack rate&#x201D; (AR) as a share of people in a group which was infected after an infection agent was introduced into the group. For example, it is estimated that swine flu infected 10-15 per cent of the world population in 2009-2010. </p><p>Obviously, there is a large difference between AR = 10 per cent and 80 per cent, no matter what is the infection-fatality rate (IFR), as in the first case 8 times fewer people will die. </p><h2>Crude AR depends on several variables</h2><p><em>1) Number of people which never contacted the virus at all (didn&#x2019;t inhale any virus particles) </em></p><p>     1a) Because they were well isolated. </p><p>     1b) Because they were lucky.</p><br><p><em>2) The number of people who have physical contact with virus particles but never develop illness:</em></p><p>     2a) Those who have a natural immunity to the virus, powerful immune system or special genetics.</p><p>     2b) Those who have cross-immunity from some other similar viruses or vaccines.</p><p>     2c) Those who already had the virus in previous time and now became a backbone of the herd immunity. </p><p>     2d) Those who had so short and mild illness that was not detectable by available methods at the time like PCR, or via self-observation (maybe because of getting only very small viral load). </p><h2>Attempts to estimate crude AR</h2><p>It is difficult to estimate the true AR, as it also depends on circumstances, like the age of people in the group, duration of exposure, viral load.</p><p>In some cases, we could measure the crude AR, but can&#x2019;t guess which of the six listed above causes explain it. For example, 712 of 3700 people on DM became ill, which gives crude AR = 19.24 per cent.</p><p>Another <a href=""https://www.dutchnews.nl/news/2020/03/dutch-submarine-cuts-off-mission-after-corona-alert-on-board/"">case</a>: &#x201C;In total, 15 members of the 58-strong crew reported sick with slight flu symptoms, including coughing and a slightly raised temperature. Tests showed eight members of the crew had or had recovered from coronavirus, the defence ministry said.&#x201D; which implies crude AR = 25.8 per cent. People inside the submarine have almost no chances to escape the virus, as they are locked inside the same space for days, so it is probably an upper level of crude AR for this age group. </p><p>In another <a href=""https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3074351/coronavirus-can-travel-twice-far-official-safe-distance-and-stay"">case</a>, 9 of 48 passengers of the bus (assuming it was full) became infected, including some who were in a remote part of the bus or board after the patients departed. which implies crude AR = 19 per cent.</p><p>These groups include only a small number of children below 18, and we didn&#x2019;t hear anything about the explosion of the virus in schools, so we could adjust our estimation of crude AR for the whole population. 13 per cent of the population in Italy <a href=""https://www.statista.com/statistics/785195/young-population-in-italy/"">is below 14 years old</a> , thus it is around 18 per cent below 18, and thus we should dilute AR by the factor of 0.82. 25.6x0.82 = 20.9.</p><p>So, different estimates give us the crude AR around 20 per cent (but it is for relatively short-term exposure, not for years-long periods).</p><h2>Possible causes of low crude AR and coping strategy</h2><p>The main question (the answer on which has tremendous importance for our coping strategy): what is the main reason for this relatively low crude AR? There are three lines of thoughts about it and three corresponding strategies:</p><ul><li>Crude AR is low because isolation measures are effective, and thus these measures should be continued with even stronger force. </li><li>Crude AR is low because of the large number of very mild, almost undetectable cases. The virus is very stable in the environment, can travel long distances through air and live a long time on surfaces. No isolation measures in cities work and all susceptible city dwellers will be infected anyway, but mostly in a mild form. The large hospital overload is because all become infected simultaneously, unlike the case of flu which is distributed throughout all winter months (and years). In that case, the herd immunity will be reached anyway, isolation in cities is not very effective (remote house in a forest may work) and this isolation only destroys the economy.</li><li>There is some unknown variable (genetic, weather, vaccination) which helps many people to escape infections. We should find which one.</li></ul><p>To solve this, we need serological population studies on CV antibodies. Another argument for (2) will be a possible peak in European infection rates in next days if some countries will reach the level implied by the crude AR. For example, there was a <a href=""https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-Europe-estimates-and-NPI-impact-30-03-2020.pdf?fbclid=IwAR0p7Gf7LjJQCoIhnkwrBr2pGpegQERh2vWan9xHWZpc2EAvJqaR-zdXsSk"">research</a> that up to 15 per cent of the population of Spain is already infected (as of 28 of March 2020). In that case, we should observe the peak of hospitalizations in Spain in the next 1-2 weeks.</p><p>ADDED: In Skagit choir 75% fell ill.  The average rate of infected was 67, according to the <a href=""https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-03-29/coronavirus-choir-outbreak"">article</a>, so obviously the attack rate is age-dependent - and also viral-load dependent. &quot;The youngest of those sickened was 31, but they averaged 67, according to the health department.&quot;</p>",avturchin,avturchin,avturchin,

Since Metaculus accounts can be entirely anonymous, why wouldn&apos;t we want every expert to input their forecast into a track record?

<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">Also related: This is an expansion of parts of</span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qYNjZZGLDQ&amp;feature=youtu.be""> <span style=""font-weight:400;"">this debate with Robin Hanson</span></a><span style=""font-weight:400;"">.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">Epistemic Status: Thinking out loud. Food for thought. Not an expert.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">Initial viral load seems likely to have a large impact on severity of Covid-19 infection. If we believe this, we should take this seriously, and evaluate both general policy and personal behavior differently in light of this information. We should also do our best to confirm or deny this hypothesis as soon as possible.</span></p>
<p><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xB9A7xymXY4xAqeMT/hanson-vs-mowshowitz-livestream-debate-should-we-expose-the""><span style=""font-weight:400;"">Robin Hanson and I had a debate</span></a><span style=""font-weight:400;""> on Sunday regarding his proposal of variolation: Deliberate Covid-19 infection of volunteers, using small viral loads, followed by isolation of those volunteers until recovery. I felt it was an excellent discussion. As with all such discussions, some key points are glossed over, lost or not stated as well as one would like in hindsight, there are areas that never come up, and one thinks of important additional things afterwards.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">What evidence do we have that viral load matters?</span></p>
<p><span id=""more-20994""></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">Three classes of evidence seem strong.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">The first is that we have a strong mechanism story we can tell. Viruses take time to multiply. When the immune system detects a virus it responds. If your initial viral load is low your immune system gets a head start, so you do better. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">The second category is the terrible outcomes in health care workers on the front lines. Those who are dealing with the crisis first hand are dealing with lots of intense exposures to the virus. When they do catch it, they are experiencing high death rates. High viral load is the only theory I know about so far for why this is the case. Their cases are presumably handled at least as well as others, in terms of detection, testing, treatment and what the infected do themselves. The only other issue I can think of is that they might be reluctant to rest given how urgently their help is needed.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">The third category is historical precedents.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">Robin&#8217;s proposal for variolation is similar to what was historically done with smallpox. Parents infected their children with what they hoped was exactly the minimum dose required to get them sick enough to develop antibodies and gain immunity. Sometimes this went wrong and the child would get sick. Thus this form of inoculation was dangerous and 1%-2% of patients died. But of those who got smallpox infections in other ways, 20%-30% of patients died. Those rates are well established.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">Another classic example is measles. We have a study that says that the first child in a family to contract the disease was relatively safe, whereas other children in the same family were 14 times as likely to die. That&#8217;s another huge gap. This is</span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3723239""> <span style=""font-weight:400;"">from a study of 126 children</span></a><span style=""font-weight:400;"">, so much less certain, but effect sizes that big are not accidents.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">Finally for SARS, we have the Hong Kong high rise</span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3367618/""> <span style=""font-weight:400;"">where proximity to the index patient played a crucial role</span></a><span style=""font-weight:400;"">. Here we see a factor of three difference. SARS being so deadly that 70%+ of highly exposed patients died could be a reason the ratio of deaths between high and low viral load was only three to one.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">There are also claims that we can observe higher viral loads from lockdowns making things worse and increase death rates, allowing us to be more confident that viral loads have a big impact. I do not find this convincing because of likely reverse causation and other highly non-random factors that determined where lockdowns happened earlier. Later on I&#8217;ll analyze the likely impact of lockdowns on viral load, where I get a different answer than Robin&#8217;s.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">It&#8217;s worth noting that we have vaccines for smallpox and measles, and the SARS virus in question was contained, so none of these three are remotely candidates for variolation no matter the true ratios.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">What is the evidence against viral load having a big impact?</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">The evidence of absence is the absence of further evidence. Yes, the effects observed were very big. Yes, they are all the result of natural experiments and we have been ethically precluded from doing randomized trials or other better studies, so the lack of those trials doesn&#8217;t mean much. But how likely is it we didn&#8217;t find more natural experiments where viral load would have differed in an observable way? Publication bias here could be a large effect.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">These effect sizes are super large. It seems odd for them to hold for some viruses, and not to have a large effect in most others. But if that&#8217;s true, how is it we are not observing them? Maybe we really don&#8217;t ever look so it&#8217;s never come up. But it definitely seems odd.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">There&#8217;s also the small sizes for the measles and SARS studies, which have about 200 patients between them. That does not seem like enough to draw general conclusions with any confidence.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">The smallpox case represents the best case, but it also represents an engineered best case of exactly the minimum dose in exactly the right way, along with awareness of the situation versus a society that otherwise had little idea how to handle infections. It also represents the case in which things went so well that ordinary people managed to fight through all the barriers and actually do the thing. It makes sense to assume this was an unusually large effect size.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">We have to ask why smallpox was a unique event, and we never used this method for any other virus. Did we even ever consider it?</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">My prior at this point is that the difference between a low and high initial viral load of Covid-19 is large. The theory makes too much sense. But with high uncertainty.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">Suppose we agree that it is likely. At a minimum, there is a large chance of a large effect, and essentially zero chance of a backfiring effect &#8211; at worst, a low dose is the same as a high one.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">What should we do? How do we take this seriously?</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">Four categories of things one might do.</span></p>
<ol>
<li style=""font-weight:400;""><span style=""font-weight:400;"">There are things we could do to get better information.</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight:400;""><span style=""font-weight:400;"">There are things individuals or small groups can do to improve their situation.</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight:400;""><span style=""font-weight:400;"">There are things society as a whole could try to do that don&#8217;t have big downsides.</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight:400;""><span style=""font-weight:400;"">We could take bold action, potentially including variolation.</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><b>Category 1: Better Information</b></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">The failure to collect more and better information about Covid-19 has been atrocious, shameful, expensive and deadly.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">We shouldn&#8217;t only be doing a crash project for a vaccine and ramping up testing much faster and immediately testing every treatment that shows any promise.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">We should be collecting extensive population-level data everywhere. Mostly we&#8217;re not collecting any data at all that isn&#8217;t massively biased.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">We should be studying with experiments how Covid-19 spreads, and how likely each method is to work, using controlled experiments. Yes, this involves infecting individuals. Considering how many lives are at stake and the ability to test using young healthy volunteers who are then isolated, I fail to see how anyone who objects on the basis of &#8216;ethics&#8217; knows what that word means, or why we should listen to them.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">We should use those experiments, and additional experiments if necessary, to study effects of viral load. Because again, that knowledge would save so many lives, in addition to tons of economic distress that could force horrible choices upon us.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">We can shut down the entire economy, force people to stay home and create double digit unemployment. And we can&#8217;t do this? Really?</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">The more I think about the Covid-19 situation, the more I think the highest leverage thing most people reading this can do is to find ways to get our hands on better data.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">Better information would (of course) make it much easier to know whether it made sense to take other action, know which actions made sense, and gain support for the right ones, across the board. As we go over what else we might do, all of that will emphasize how valuable more information would be.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">My current best thought for how to do experiments quickly is medical cruise ships in international waters. We even have lots of spare cruise ships lying around with nothing to do right now, which we could convert if we needed to. Medical cruise ships are already an established way to do things without running into regulatory problems. We could do things properly, in a way that would give trustworthy results and would allow others to trust the data. The tests required are not expensive or difficult to produce if no FDA regulations get in one&#8217;s way. Such projects are well within the &#8216;Bill Gates decides to just go ahead and do this&#8217; price range.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">Still, one must be realistic. Given we likely won&#8217;t get much good information soon, and time is very short, I&#8217;ll proceed as if we are physically prevented from information gathering.</span></p>
<h3><b>Category 2: Things Individuals or Small Groups Can Do</b></h3>
<h3><b>Bird&#8217;s Eye View</b></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">Things individuals can do are a good place to start, because &#8216;scale up what an individual should do&#8217; is an excellent hypothesis for much of what a society should do. I agree with Robin Hanson that people who are at risk, and say they are more concerned with infecting others than becoming infected, are usually wrong about that. I still think most people care a lot about preventing others from becoming infected. Incentives, in most places, are not so misaligned.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">The first question one would ask is, what infection methods result in a high load, versus which methods result in a low load. Or to be more granular, what lowers or raises such loads.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">The default model is that the longer and more closely you interact with an infected person, especially a symptomatic infected person, the larger your viral load.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">In-household infections are presumed to be high viral load, as in the case of measles. So would be catching the infection while treating patients.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">Most out-of-household infections that aren&#8217;t health care related are presumed to be low viral load. Anything outdoors is probably low viral load. Most methods that involve surfaces are probably low viral load. Infection via the air from someone there half an hour ago, to the extent this is a thing, is low viral load. Quick interactions with asymptomatic individuals are probably low viral load.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">Knowledge would of course be far better than supposition. If anyone has actual information on any of this, please do share it in the comments. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">The only method that seems highly ambiguous is the fecal-oral transmission route. We don&#8217;t know how dangerous it is either in terms of infection probability or likely viral load. It could be anything from almost harmless to very dangerous. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">To a first approximation, we can say that a typical person (who is not a health care worker) should consider it more deadly to be infected via household transmission. They should consider it less deadly to be infected out-of-household.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">We can also consider it relatively more deadly when the infection risk from a given source was otherwise high, or one might be infected from multiple sources at once. When one is exposed to a low-probability infection from a small number of sources, expected viral load is low.</span></p>
<h3><b>How Many Infections are High Versus Low Load Now?</b></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">One place I disagree with Robin Hanson&#8217;s analysis is that he is comparing an intervention to create universal low viral loads to an alternative of mostly high viral loads.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">I believe he is discounting the extent to which many infections are already low viral load. Consider our intuitive model, and infection rates from the poorly named category &#8216;close contacts.&#8217;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">If you had an infected &#8216;close contact&#8217; in Wuhan,</span><a href=""https://t.co/1blJFUQysS,""> <span style=""font-weight:400;"">your probability of infection was only 2.5%</span></a><span style=""font-weight:400;"">. Close contacts within the household were much more likely than those outside it to pass along the infection. If we focus on asymptomatic close contacts outside the household, we match our intuition that infection is possible but any given person is unlikely to infect us &#8211; the paper gives the probability of infection from each asymptomatic &#8216;close contact&#8217; that wasn&#8217;t all that close at only 0.03%!</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">Under current lock down conditions, where anyone who got this far into this post (again, who doesn&#8217;t have an essential job that prevents this) is presumably avoiding anyone symptomatic, and most symptomatic people are self-isolating or seeking help, it does not seem so hard for most of us to avoid direct out-of-household interaction with highly symptomatic people.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">Thus, let&#8217;s simplify the baseline for those taking &#8216;ordinary precautions.&#8217; Out of household transmission is low load. Inside of household transmission is high load. To balance this out, let&#8217;s presume that if anyone in a household gets infected, they are probably going to infect the rest of the household, and we&#8217;ll set that probability at 100%.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">If you are the only member of your household, unless you take big risks or something highly unlikely happens, you&#8217;re going to have a low viral load.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">If you are one of two members, then one of you will get a low load, and one of you will then probably get a high load.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">Overall infection rates are unknown due to inexcusably poor data, but we do know that the probability of infection </span><i><span style=""font-weight:400;"">on a given day for a given person who is taking precautions </span></i><span style=""font-weight:400;"">is low even if many are currently infected around them. Thus, unless household members are exposed from the same source at the same time, the probability of simultaneous infection that gets them both a low viral load is very low and can be rounded off to zero.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">The biggest factor thus effectively becomes, how big is your household?</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">The average household size in the United States of America is about 2.6 people. If we exclude children, the average household size is 2.02 people, which we&#8217;ll round to 2.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">Children can spread the infection, but they probably are not as effective at it and they do not have essential work outside the home. It should mostly be easy, once schools have closed, to avoid having them get infected before other household members. If they are infected in-household, we don&#8217;t care much if they have high viral loads since their risk remains very low.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">Thus, of those that matter and who reside in a household, approximately 50% will get low viral loads in a lock down. This will </span><i><span style=""font-weight:400;"">briefly </span></i><span style=""font-weight:400;"">be false in the first week of a lock down, since you clamp down on out-of-household infections but not inside-of-household infections during that period. But longer term, the impact of higher-probability inside-of-household transmission does not matter very much, because the probability of inside-of-household transmission, once someone got infected, was so high already. The only effective defense is to stop out-of-household transmission so everyone in the household stays uninfected in the first place.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">Lock downs seem like they would decrease viral load conditional on an out-of-household infection, as long duration in-person indoor interactions, and other ways to get a high viral load, seem to be down a lot more than other out-of-household transmission vectors. So intuitively, lock downs are actually net good for viral load.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">The exception is if they change household size, by causing people to shelter together, which brings us back to what groups can do.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">We also need to consider what to do about those in institutions, especially nursing homes. That could drive these numbers higher, if such people are effectively inside the same household, and that can&#8217;t be fixed.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">Looking at a 50% low risk, 50% high risk scenario, we can only save 50% of what we could save if we started in a 50% high risk scenario. So a range of factors of 3-30, which I already discounted because of selection bias in the evidence, can further be cut in half. That gives us a reasonable range of room for improvement of about a factor of 1.5-10. Still a big win! That could be higher if we could do even lower initial loads than what we are calling &#8216;low load&#8217; but a procedure that is &lt;0.1% to infect you already seems likely to functionally be close to the minimum dose.</span></p>
<h3><b>One&#8217;s Own Risk</b></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">If you are living alone, that seems </span><i><span style=""font-weight:400;"">great.</span></i></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">By definition, you can&#8217;t be infected inside-of-household with a household size of one. Thus, unless you need to do other high-risk activity, your viral load will be low.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">If you are already mostly self-isolating, then you can worry less about incoming holes in your containment procedures. If you do get infected, you&#8217;re unlikely to pass it along, your risk will be lower than you would otherwise calculate,</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">There is an argument that if you&#8217;re alone and not going outside for a month conditional on getting packages, and you are young and healthy, you can stop worrying about getting Covid-19 from those packages. If it did happen, you are perhaps doing a solid approximation of variolation, after which you will be immune. That might actively be better than wiping the packages down or letting them sit for three days.</span></p>
<h3><b>Two to Tango</b></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">If there are two people in the household, the calculus changes. We also get some non-intuitive results &#8211; since infecting anyone in the household probably infects everyone, protecting the more vulnerable member of the household means </span><i><span style=""font-weight:400;"">you want them to be infected first.</span></i></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">The first thing to note is that, in theory, sufficiently </span><i><span style=""font-weight:400;"">correlated </span></i><span style=""font-weight:400;"">risk to both individuals seems actively great. Both of you getting infected at the same time means you both get low viral loads. This is not easy to pull off, since most risks worth taking are low probability even when they are risky (e.g. &lt;1% chance of infection even if the close contact is infected) so the chance of actually catching it at the same time is still low. But it could be worth thinking about.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">The second thing is that people may be allocating infection risk </span><i><span style=""font-weight:400;"">backwards </span></i><span style=""font-weight:400;"">by default. Suppose you have a high risk old individual in poor health, and a low risk young individual in good health. You can&#8217;t get groceries delivered and supplies are running low, so someone has to run to the store. Who goes?</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">Intuition says of course the individual in good health should take the risk. But if we take the whole model seriously, that seems wrong now! If the healthy individual gets infected first then you have a low-risk infection in a low-risk individual (small win) who then infects the high-risk individual and puts them at high-risk again (big loss). You would want to reverse that process.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">The counterargument here is that there is some evidence that higher risk individuals are also going to catch the virus more easily, which could prevent the situation from reversing. Again, we need better data!</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">The third thing is that social distancing </span><i><span style=""font-weight:400;"">within the household </span></i><span style=""font-weight:400;"">starts to look more valuable. Viral load depends on the exact interactions that take place. It makes sense to place at least some value on minimizing infection exposures between household members, </span><i><span style=""font-weight:400;"">even if you are mostly resigned to the infection eventually happening once anyone gets infected. </span></i><span style=""font-weight:400;"">There is still something important to win.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">A household with varying risk levels due to age or health, to the extent possible, might choose to concentrate as much within-household exposure as possible in the less risky direction. For example, perhaps the person at high risk should be doing most of the cooking.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">If one person does show symptoms first, precautions then become super valuable, even if they probably ultimately fail to prevent spread.</span></p>
<h3><b>Three is a Crowd</b></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">Larger households mean bigger risk of high viral loads. Such groups have both a higher risk of infection at all (since any of them could get infected) they also carry a bigger risk via higher expected viral loads. Thus, as a group scales higher, precautions become even more important.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">The obvious strategy is to </span><i><span style=""font-weight:400;"">break up large households. </span></i><span style=""font-weight:400;"">If you have more than two adults in a group, consider that an even higher cost. If you have a lot more than two, this gets extreme. And as before, if you have low-risk individuals together with high-risk ones, having the low-risk individuals take all the risks looks pretty bad. If you do that, it might make sense to consider social distancing within the household where feasible, if it can turn potential inner-household transmissions into effectively out-of-household transmissions. This is especially true if you have reason to believe someone may have been exposed recently.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">If there are multiple households considering interacting with each other, that now looks like a bigger additional risk as well. Those types of interactions could effectively be inner-household style contacts.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">For those with family members or housemates who insist on taking risks, you should be even more worried than before. The people living with the risk-taker are now at greater risk than the risk-taker themselves. It becomes that much more important to do something about such actions.</span></p>
<h3><b>Category 3: What Society Can Easily Do (Beyond Gathering Data)</b></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">If we think there are things individuals should do, society&#8217;s first job is to encourage those people to do those things. Thus, everything in category two could be added to existing lists of recommendations.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">But that&#8217;s not a practical answer. Bandwidth is limited. People are already overloaded with information, and with disinformation.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">If</span><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4ZvJab25tDebB8FGE/you-have-about-five-words""> <span style=""font-weight:400;"">you only get about five words</span></a><span style=""font-weight:400;"">, those five words need to be something like &#8220;socially distance, wash hands, mask.&#8221; Even not touching your face wouldn&#8217;t make the cut. We still have major organizations continuing to actively spread disinformation against even that level of response.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">Everything we go over here is therefore probably far too subtle. It also risks muddling the messaging on more important matters. Any intervention </span><i><span style=""font-weight:400;"">for the public </span></i><span style=""font-weight:400;"">as opposed to people who read long analytical blog posts needs to have a focused simple message that could be attached at the end of the current list of simple useful interventions.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">Another argument against spending bandwidth on this is that minimizing an individual&#8217;s viral load does not much help bend or smash the curve, and anything that reduces R0 is higher leverage and takes priority over other actions. The obvious retort is that lots of people in my circles and other circles are focusing on ventilators.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">The simple message of </span><i><span style=""font-weight:400;"">minimize household size </span></i><span style=""font-weight:400;"">seems like a reasonable candidate. Since a large percentage of infections are within-household, this seems like a strong intervention even without viral load concerns. Perhaps we want to emphasize this more. We could use the viral load argument as an additional justification for an already good intervention.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">A second strategy would be to ban activities that lead to high viral loads but not ban those that lead to low viral loads. This could make infections less deadly while doing less economic damage. The risk is that there are still a lot of large households out there. It seems beyond our abilities to say &#8220;people living alone and not working in a highly interactive position can do X, but not people living with others or working in ways that interact with others.&#8221; I would love to be wrong about that. Still, some amount of adjustment of what we do and don&#8217;t permit or encourage, on the margin, would be helpful.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">It seems hard to do more than that on a broad basis until we have much better data. So again, the most low-hanging fruit is to gather data. Run experiments. Do more and faster science to it.</span></p>
<h3><b>Category 4: Bold Action</b></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">Suppose we manage to gather better data and it turns out viral loads are a big deal.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">Say, we become confident that minimal loads have a 0.1% death rate with proper medical care and high loads have a 2% death rate with proper medical care, and lock down conditions have a roughly 50/50 mix of both and a 1% death rate. That&#8217;s a bigger effect than I expect, but very much in the realm of the possible.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">That difference is a really, really big deal. It&#8217;s a much bigger deal than getting enough ventilators. It&#8217;s potentially a bigger deal than having a medical system at all. Alternatively, it&#8217;s potentially a bigger deal than the difference between 100% infection rates and the infection rate a few weeks from now (or in some places like Spain or New York City, potentially the infection rate today). It&#8217;s not enough to overcome both of those differences at once.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">It is certainly a big enough difference to justify bold action to minimize high viral load infections among our most vulnerable populations.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">Suppose we got our act together. We want to do more than nudge individual behavior. We are willing to do things that people find instinctively repugnant, provided they save lives while at least not hurting the economy. How could we accomplish this?</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">The possibilities I can see are subsidizing household divisions, strategic variolation of individuals, variolation of the young and healthy, or variolation of the old and vulnerable.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">Subsidizing household divisions means exactly what it sounds like. We could offer tax or other incentives, up to and including providing housing and forcing people to use it, in order to break up sufficiently large groups of adults, or sufficiently large groups of adults that contain at least one at-risk member (e.g. someone over the age of 60, or 70). Given the economic costs of shutdown, actions that involve spending large amounts of money and/or using large amounts of coercion are being underconsidered in general. We are already using lots of coercion and paying gigantic economic costs! The difference is we are doing so passively, via preventing actions, rather than actively via causing actions. That&#8217;s not a hill I want us to (literally) die on.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">Then there are variolation strategies, where we deliberately infect individuals. Or alternatively, if we find out-of-household infections are low enough viral load, perhaps we could do this passively via allowing those in single-adult households to do things that cause them to infect each other in such ways, while otherwise taking strong precautions so they avoid infecting others. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">There are a lot of bad objections to such policies. I won&#8217;t waste space addressing them other to note that they present practical barriers to implementation, and that they force us to be sure to do all of this carefully and correctly to have a chance of avoiding being shut down or worse.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">One very strong objection is that our medical system is about to be overwhelmed. Anyone we expose now will either take needed resources away from others, or go without those resources. Thus, we either need to be in a world in which everyone is already going to get infected while the system is overwhelmed and we can&#8217;t stop it (in which case perhaps the best we can do is get remaining people low viral loads and hope for the best), or a world in which the virus has been contained for now but where we don&#8217;t have a long term plan that can keep it that way (e.g. some places can squash and keep their medical systems stable for a while, but they can&#8217;t stop reintroductions while reopening the economy, and the economic costs of doing this for long enough to wait for a vaccine or other solution are not an option). </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">Infecting the young and healthy is the natural first thing to model. The young are at relatively low risk. That risk is not zero, even if we assume big impacts from low viral loads, screening for comorbidities and ensure good at-home care. But if such people will eventually probably get infected anyway, we can reduce their net risk while allowing them to return to work and other activity much faster. Then that slows the further spread of the virus, hopefully allowing more high-risk individuals to never get infected at all. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">Robin&#8217;s current best concrete suggestion, once we have established the safety and value of the procedure via testing, is to create variolation villages. Those who voluntarily participate and are deemed healthy enough would be isolated and infected, we would verify the infection and then allow them free access to the village until they were safely cured and non-infectious. Then they could return to their lives and move freely. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">One could respond that this is exactly backwards. If low viral loads are a big win, why are we protecting those who least need that protection? Why aren&#8217;t we protecting those who most need it? This argues that, given we will have limited capacity, we should instead look to variolate the old and at risk, since we are reducing risk and they benefit from this the most.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">Going down this path means we’ve concluded that protecting them, via herd immunity from the young or via general suppression or otherwise, is not realistic. These are exactly the people who ideally we don’t let get infected at all. If they do get infected, even carefully, they will need a lot of care. Doing this requires even more ideal conditions than infecting the young. We either need a lot of spare medical resources without having much hope of long term containment, or we need to have essentially no hope of stretching things out very far before most are infected.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">Those who are capable of sustained safe isolation would want to avoid participating even under the best conditions.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">That leaves what I am calling strategic variolation. Rather than taking whoever volunteers, or sorting by age and health, we choose people who (both volunteer and) provide superior leverage. Look for those who would otherwise be forced to expose themselves to high viral loads or lots of interactions. Alternatively, look for activities that cannot be done while social distancing, but which have very high value. Focus on those categories of individuals and at least give them priority. Alas, many would consider this an even worse look than a general call for volunteers, so much so that I am not naming anyone I would prioritize. If we got farther along this path, there would be plenty of time to discuss that.</span></p>
<h3><b>Conclusion</b></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">Viral loads are not being taken seriously. We should take them seriously.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">On an individual and household level, that means thinking carefully about how to avoid high viral load infections especially for those most at risk.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">On a societal level, that means gathering much better data about how impactful this factor is and how it works (and about all other aspects of what is happening, of course), so we can consider taking bold action if appropriate. It also likely means encouraging smaller household groups during the pandemic. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">Remember, I am not an expert. This is only me thinking out loud. </span></p>

The idea of logical counterfactuals has appeared in previous agent foundations research (especially at MIRI): <a href=""https://intelligence.org/2017/03/18/new-paper-cheating-death-in-damascus/"">here</a>, <a href=""https://intelligence.org/2018/10/31/embedded-decisions/"">here</a>. ""Impossible possible worlds"" have been considered elsewhere in the literature; see <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/impossible-worlds/"">the SEP article</a> for a summary.</p>
<p>I will start by motivating the problem, which also gives an account for what a logical counterfactual is meant to be.</p>
<p>Suppose you learn about physics and find that you are a robot. You learn that your source code is ""A"". You also believe that you have free will; in particular, you may decide to take either action X or action Y. In fact, you take action X. Later, you simulate ""A"" and find, unsurprisingly, that when you give it the observations you saw up to deciding to take action X or Y, it outputs action X. However, you, at the time, had the sense that you could have taken action Y instead. You want to be consistent with your past self, so you want to, at this later time, believe that you could have taken action Y at the time. If you could have taken Y, then you <em>do</em> take Y in some possible world (which still satisfies the same laws of physics). In this possible world, it is the case that ""A"" returns Y upon being given those same observations. But, the output of ""A"" when given those observations is a fixed computation, so you now need to reason about a possible world that is logically incoherent, given your knowledge that ""A"" in fact returns X. This possible world is, then, a logical counterfactual: a ""possible world"" that is logically incoherent.</p>
<p>To summarize: a logical counterfactual is a notion of ""what would have happened"" had you taken a different action after seeing your source code, and in that ""what would have happened"", the source code must output a different action than what you actually took; hence, this ""what would have happened"" world is logically incoherent.</p>
<p>It is easy to see that this idea of logical counterfactuals is unsatisfactory. For one, no good account of them has yet been given. For two, there is a sense in which no account <em>could</em> be given; reasoning about logically incoherent worlds can only be so extensive before running into logical contradiction.</p>
<p>To extensively refute the idea, it is necessary to provide an alternative account of the motivating problem(s) which dispenses with the idea. Even if logical counterfactuals are unsatisfactory, the motivating problem(s) remain.</p>
<p>I now present two alternative accounts: counterfactual nonrealism, and policy-dependent source code.</p>
<h2>Counterfactual nonrealism</h2>
<p>According to counterfactual nonrealism, there is no fact of the matter about what ""would have happened"" had a different action been taken. There is, simply, the sequence of actions you take, and the sequence of observations you get. At the time of taking an action, you are uncertain about what that action is; hence, from your perspective, there are multiple possibilities.</p>
<p>Given this uncertainty, you may consider <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_conditional"">material conditionals</a>: if I take action X, will consequence Q necessarily follow? An action may be selected on the basis of these conditionals, such as by determining which action results in the highest guaranteed expected utility if that action is taken.</p>
<p>This is basically the approach taken in my post on <a href=""https://unstableontology.com/2020/03/05/subjective-implication-decision-theory-in-critical-agentialism/"">subjective implication decision theory</a>. It is also the approach taken by <a href=""https://intelligence.org/files/UDTSearchOrder.pdf"">proof-based UDT</a>.</p>
<p>The material conditionals are ephemeral, in that at a later time, the agent will know that they could only have taken a certain action (assuming they knew their source code before taking the action), due to having had longer to think by then; hence, all the original material conditionals will be vacuously true. The apparent nondeterminism is, then, only due to the epistemic limitation of the agent at the time of making the decision, a limitation not faced by a later version of the agent (or an outside agent) with more computation power.</p>
<p>This leads to a sort of relativism: what is undetermined from one perspective may be determined from another. This makes global accounting difficult: it's hard for one agent to evaluate whether another agent's action is any good, because the two agents have different epistemic states, resulting in different judgments on material conditionals.</p>
<p>A problem that comes up is that of ""spurious counterfactuals"" (analyzed in the linked paper on proof-based UDT). An agent may become sure of its own action before that action is taken. Upon being sure of that action, the agent will know the material implication that, if they take a different action, something terrible will happen (this material implication is vacuously true). Hence the agent may take the action they were sure they would take, making the original certainty self-fulfilling. (There are technical details with how the agent becomes certain having to do with Löb's theorem).</p>
<p>The most natural decision theory resulting in this framework is <a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Timeless_decision_theory"">timeless decision theory</a> (rather than <a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Updateless_decision_theory"">updateless decision theory</a>). This is because the agent updates on what they know about the world so far, and considers the material implications of themselves taken a certain action; these implications include logical implications if the agent knows their source code. Note that timeless decision theory is dynamically inconsistent in the <a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Counterfactual_mugging"">counterfactual mugging problem</a>.</p>
<h2>Policy-dependent source code</h2>
<p>A second approach is to assert that one's source code depends on one's entire policy, rather than only one's actions up to seeing one's source code.</p>
<p>Formally, a policy is a function mapping an observation history to an action. It is distinct from source code, in that the source code specifies the implementation of the policy in some programming language, rather than itself being a policy function.</p>
<p>Logically, it is impossible for the same source code to generate two different policies. There is a fact of the matter about what action the source code outputs given an observation history (assuming the program halts). Hence there is no way for two different policies to be compatible with the same source code.</p>
<p>Let's return to the robot thought experiment and re-analyze it in light of this. After the robot has seen that their source code is ""A"" and taken action X, the robot considers what would have happened if they had taken action Y instead. However, if they had taken action Y instead, then their policy would, trivially, have to be different from their actual policy, which takes action X. Hence, their source code would be different. Hence, they would not have seen that their source code is ""A"".</p>
<p>Instead, if the agent were to take action Y upon seeing that their source code is ""A"", their source code must be something else, perhaps ""B"". Hence, which action the agent would have taken depends directly on their policy's behavior upon seeing that the source code is ""B"", and indirectly on the entire policy (as source code depends on policy).</p>
<p>We see, then, that the original thought experiment encodes a reasoning error. The later agent wants to ask what would have happened if they had taken a different action after knowing their source code; however, the agent neglects that such a policy change would have resulted in seeing different source code! Hence, there is no need to posit a logically incoherent possible world.</p>
<p>The reasoning error came about due to using a conventional, linear notion of interactive causality. Intuitively, what you see up to time <em>t</em> depends only on your actions before time <em>t</em>. However, policy-dependent source code breaks this condition. What source code you see that you have depends on your entire policy, not just what actions you took up to seeing your source code. Hence, reasoning under policy-dependent source code requires abandoning linear interactive causality.</p>
<p>The most natural decision theory resulting from this approach is updateless decision theory, rather that timeless decision theory, as it is the entire policy that the counterfactual is on.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Before very recently, my philosophical approach had been counterfactual nonrealism. However, I am now more compelled by policy-dependent source code, after having analyzed it. I believe this approach fixes the main problem of counterfactual nonrealism, namely relativism making global accounting difficult. It also fixes the inherent dynamic inconsistency problems that TDT has relative to UDT (which are related to the relativism).</p>
<p>I believe the re-analysis I have provided of the thought experiment motivating logical counterfactuals is sufficient to refute the original interpretation, and thus to de-motivate logical counterfactuals.</p>
<p>The main problem with policy-dependent source code is that, since it violates linear interactive causality, analysis is correspondingly more difficult. Hence, there is further work to be done in considering simplified environment classes where possible simplifying assumptions (including linear interactive causality) can be made. It is critical, though, that the linear interactive causality assumption not be used in analyzing cases of an agent learning their source code, as this results in logical incoherence.</p>

Why? Because you hear all the things about Mozilla Hubs that you do about any startup about to take off. Words like “Unusable”, “Irritating” and “An all-round terrible UI experience”. If people are saying this about your product and still using it, that means it’s got to be good.</p><p>To give some hard data on this, in a survey of a recent academic conference held on the Mozilla Hubs platform, the attendees reported the following <a href=""https://extendedmind.io/blog/2020/3/2/enhancing-the-experience-of-virtual-conferences-in-social-vr-recap-of-2019-uist-conference-research"">genuine data</a> (emphasis added):</p><blockquote><p>With support from the co-chairs of the 2019 ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology (UIST) and the Hubs by Mozilla internal product team, we surveyed the motivations and experiences of remote attendees and discovered:</p><p><strong>92% of all Social VR attendees would like to repeat the experience of attending a conference remotely</strong> <strong>using Hubs.</strong></p><p>69% of all remote attendees rated the experience as very good or mostly good.</p><p>[...]</p><p>[Many] respondents reported difficulty hearing audio, poor visibility of the presentations, and lags in the presentation.</p><p><strong>Only half of participants</strong> <strong>claimed they understood how to use the technology.</strong></p></blockquote><p>So, to be clear, of the attendees of this conference, half didn't know how to use the actual software, but almost all of them (92%!) would like to repeat the experience anyways! How much of a burning need does a product need to fill that at least 42% of your users want to continue using your product, whilst claiming not to know how to actually use your product? To us, this signals amazing product-market fit, and I think we should jump on the bandwagon as early as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>What are its other selling points? In Mozilla Hubs you can visit the site in 3 dimensions. You'll also be able to see the other visitors, and engage in all of the social primate behaviours humans normally do at parties like talking, laughing, and continuously saying “is my microphone working?”, “can anyone hear me?” and “how does walking work again?”.</p><p>Have you ever wanted to be in a room with more than 25 people? No? Neither have we, so all rooms have a limit of 25 people who are allowed to enter. In addition, as we approach 25 people, the room will slow down on all devices and become significantly more laggy, causing the conversation to naturally slow down to prevent it from spiraling out of control.</p><p>If you've been part of LessWrong for any significant amount of time, you know how much effort we've spent thinking about how to avoid the problem of eternal september. Recently, after looking at our analytics for multiple minutes, we found out that a lot of users we don’t want have much slower computers, or are using their phones to browse LessWrong.&nbsp;</p><p>So, by making LessWrong basically unusable on those devices, we are ensuring a continued high-quality discussion experience on the site, by filtering only for rational people who spend exorbitant amounts of money on their computer hardware. We've already had great success with this strategy when we drastically increased the processing power necessary to run LessWrong 2.0 by moving everything to a javascript based web-app architecture, so we consider this a natural next step for us to take.</p><p>(As a continuation of <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/K3qnYdBGjzPiBrPzS/april-fools-announcing-karma-2-0"">Karma 2.0</a> we are working on a feature in which your avatar size can scale with your karma, such that users with the most karma can signal their superiority even better, and truly tower over their intellectual contemporaries.)</p><p>So it has come to this.

A subprinciple of the principle of  representation, it enjoins that the vocabulary of a subject language be  empirically derived from the literature it is intended to describe. This  means that a literature must be determined. For Hulme, the language in  question was the Library of Congress Classification (LCC), and the  literature that served as warrant were the books housed in the Library  of Congress. For a discipline-specific language, the literature might be  defined as the canonical texts in the discipline or as the core set of  documents of the discipline, as this is determined by citation  frequency. Once the literature of a discipline is defined, then  expressions in it indicative of aboutness become candidates for  inclusion in the vocabulary of the language. <br><br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#x2014; Elaine Svenonius, <em>The Intellectual Foundation Of Information Organization</em> </blockquote><p><a href=""https://thelastrationalist.com/on-necessity.html"">In the previous post</a> I discussed the concept of phenomenological necessity. Reality has a consistent ruleset on which we can base reasoning. Our expectations about reality should be based on rules and sense-data derived from reality. The extreme consistency of physics is one of the most important revelations of the 20th century: while our world is dizzying in its complexity and <a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/01/11/the-phatic-and-the-anti-inductive/"">anti-inductive in its presentation</a> the underlying principles are comparatively simple: </p><blockquote>The vision I got from Democritus was of a God who was single-mindedly  obsessed with enforcing a couple of rules about certain types of  information you are not allowed to have under any circumstances. Some of  these rules I&#x2019;d already known about. You can&#x2019;t have information from  outside your light cone. You can&#x2019;t have information about the speed and  position of a particle at the same time. Others I hadn&#x2019;t thought about  as much until reading Democritus. Information about when a Turing  machine will halt. Information about whether certain formal systems are  consistent. Precise information about the quantum state of a particle.  The reason God hasn&#x2019;t solved world poverty yet is that He is pacing  about feverishly worried that someone, somewhere, is going to be able to  measure the quantum state of a particle too precisely, and dreaming up  new and increasingly bizarre ways He can prevent that from happening. <br><br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#x2014; Scott Alexander, <em><a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/01/book-review-and-highlights-quantum-computing-since-democritus/"">Book Review and Highlights: Quantum Computing Since Democritus</a></em> </blockquote><blockquote>Okay, Bayes-Goggles back on. Are you really going to believe that large  parts of the wavefunction disappear when you can no longer see them? As a  result of the only non-linear non-unitary non-differentiable  non-CPT-symmetric acausal faster-than-light informally-specified  phenomenon in all of physics? Just because, by sheer historical  contingency, the stupid version of the theory was proposed first? <br><br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#x2014; Eliezer Yudkowsky, <em><a href=""https://www.readthesequences.com/The-Dilemma-Science-Or-Bayes"">The Dilemma: Science or Bayes?</a></em> </blockquote><p>The complexity that arises from these &apos;simple&apos; rules leads to uncertainty, and that uncertainty makes the world unpredictable and difficult for our minds to make sense of. We might imagine ourselves in a maze, carefully mapping our environment. As better patterns come along that predict the maze with increasing accuracy and economy of expression  we manage to put more and more of the maze into a smaller and smaller representation. But as the representation becomes smaller, the work necessary to unpack it into the territory we&apos;re interested in increases. <a href=""https://www.xkcd.com/793/"">It&apos;s difficult to model most real world systems just by knowing their underlying physics</a>. The complexity of how reality expresses itself forces us to rely on abstractions, mental models, and approximations. There&apos;s no easy way to know everything about anything. This means that <em>which</em> questions and forms of knowledge we choose to acquire is just as important as any reasoning techniques we use to deal with them. </p><p>A good example of this can be found in the book <em>Evangelism Explosion</em>  by D. James Kennedy. Written with the goal of making modern Christian churches see exponential growth, the author shares (at  length and in detail) exactly how he goes about witnessing Christ to others and teaching Christians to witness. What&apos;s striking  about it is that before he attempts to share the gospel, he makes a point of <a href=""https://evangelismexplosion.org/the-two-question/"">asking two questions</a>  to set up the conversation: Whether the target knows they&apos;ll be with god after they die and what they&apos;d say if  god asked them why he should let them in. The thing I find so interesting about this is that <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framing_(social_sciences)"">he opens with a Christian frame</a>, and mostly seems to ignore the possibility that you might encounter an atheist or even a Hindu.</p><p>The script itself is simple, seemingly just a positive presentation  of the basic idea that eternal life can be yours if you give up your mind and body to  Christ. I found this so shocking that I stopped reading and asked an apostate if  this stuff really worked, and he informed me that it did. I&apos;d always thought of Evangelists as being out to convert  non-Christians, but if I&apos;m to take what I read from them seriously the  goal is mostly to take weak Christian theists and turn them into strong  Christian theists. By the time you&apos;re willing to engage with a question like &quot;Will you be with god in heaven after you die?&quot; you&apos;re  already most of the way to being a Christian. Imagine this same conversation with an atheist, who would say &quot;Woah woah back up, who says  this &apos;god&apos; character exists? Why do you think that?&quot;. If engaging with someone&apos;s questions about god takes you most of the way to being  Christian, it should be obvious that letting other people ask you questions without justification takes you most of the way to believing  whatever they want you to believe.</p><p>Eliezer Yudkowsky discusses this problem frequently in his <em>Rationality: AI to Zombies</em>. Most notable is his essay on <a href=""https://www.readthesequences.com/Privileging-The-Hypothesis"">privileging the hypothesis</a>, where he tries to get across a similar idea. There Eliezer imagines numbering every possible hypothesis in a scenario from one to some very large number  like 4 billion. He then uses the basic principles of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory"">information theory</a>  to show that taking a question without justification is to skip over the vast  majority of possibilities. Remember that only one hypothesis is the truth, so to do this without care risks excluding the correct  answer from consideration before we&apos;ve even begun to analyze things. Unfortunately, I didn&apos;t understand what he meant on my first  read, because I wasn&apos;t very familiar with computer science. </p><p>This idea is of extreme importance, so it&apos;s worth explaining in  detail. To keep it simple, lets go back to that notion of numbering every hypothesis above noise from one to 4 billion. It takes a certain  amount of <em>information</em> to represent this number. The standard unit of information in computer science is of course the binary digit  (bit), a one or a zero. A single bit has two possibilities, 1 or 0. Two bits in sequence can be combined four ways: 00,01,10,11. If we add a  third bit, you will find there are eight combinations. In fact, each added bit allows us to represent twice the number of combinations.  By the time we have put together 32 bits, we can represent 4 billion possibilities. As we gain information about a problem, we (hopefully)  narrow in on the correct point in this sea of hypothesis. To ask a  question that narrows us down to say, 10 possibilities, is to assert that we have  already collected the vast majority of information, or the majority of bits necessary to represent our choice in this domain. If you consider a  question merely because the question has been asked, you are allowing  other people to choose most of your beliefs for you.</p><p>We can call this notion of whether or not a question is justified <em>warrant</em>, in the same sense that the police  need a <em>warrant</em> before they can search a US citizens house. If  necessity asks &quot;Is this a reasonable expectation?&quot;, warrant asks &quot;Why  are(n&apos;t) we  considering this question?&quot;. The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-world_hypothesis"">just world fallacy</a>, <a href=""https://www.thelastrationalist.com/memento-mori-said-the-confessor.html"">denial of death</a>, and  <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmodernism"">postmodernism</a> are failures of necessity. <a href=""https://www.readthesequences.com/Privileging-The-Hypothesis"">Privileging the hypothesis</a>,  <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias"">confirmation bias</a>, and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_rate_fallacy"">the base rate fallacy</a>  are failures of warrant. Together, warrant and necessity form the  &quot;punch and kick&quot; of rationality, basic foundational moves which must be  practiced and mastered before it&apos;s possible to reliably execute more  advanced technique.</p><p>Necessity and warrant go together, because to get good at using necessity we have to manage uncertainty, and usefully managing uncertainty forces us to get good at warrant. For example, in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Good_Judgment_Project"">the tournaments run by Philip Tetlock to see who is best at predicting the future</a> the winners tend to explore much more of the hypothesis space than the mediocre. Instead of examining one possibility and prematurely narrowing things down to a handful of outcomes (all of which might be wrong) they look at several possible outcomes and try to weigh their probability against each other. This sort of thorough exploration helps us become more justified in our beliefs. Evaluating the relative likelihood of a set of possibilities moves us beyond focusing on individual facts or ideas, and facilitates the creation of consistent mental models of reality which can begin to suggest necessary conclusions.</p><p>Consider again the earlier questions about god. Christianity claims that those who don&apos;t give up their mind and body to Christ will be eternally damned. This is a pretty scary idea, but it becomes a bit less scary when we consider other theologies claiming much the same thing. Even in the Abrahamic family alone we have Judaism, Christianity, and Islam which all mutually claim followers of the other two will meet their end in the lake of fire. Just by considering all of the major world religions, we find the framing attack James Kennedy uses to persuade less compelling. </p><p>The failure of warrant is also behind one of the more important design flaws in modern republics: focusing control mechanisms on the <em>consideration</em> of new laws rather than the <em>proposal</em> of new laws. In theory a republic is meant to be kept in check by allowing competing interests at the table, which prevents one segment of society from unfairly appropriating state power to enrich and elevate itself over others. The <a href=""https://www.oregonlegislature.gov/citizen_engagement/Pages/How-an-Idea-Becomes-Law.aspx"">typical implementation of this</a>  assumes that ideas for new laws appear because of &quot;concerned citizens&quot;, and the process doesn&apos;t focus too much on the origins or justifications for laws. In the context of information theory, this is a recipe for disaster. If simply proposing a question takes us most of the way to saying &quot;yes&quot;, then in practice what we&apos;ve done with this ruleset is leave most of the power of making laws almost completely unregulated and uncontrolled. Bad actors can re-propose their unpopular initiatives until they get the right set of circumstances for them to pass.</p><h2>Principles Of Warrant</h2><p><a href=""https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/pC74aJyCRgns6atzu/meta-discussion-from-circling-as-cousin-to-rationality#comment-c7Xt5AnHwhfgYY67K"">The last time I talked about warrant</a> I avoided precisely defining what makes a question worth considering, pushing the matter out to social consensus. But the worthiness of questions exists independently of social approval. To think clearly even when those around us don&apos;t requires some kind of objective standard. In her <em>Intellectual Foundation Of Information Organization</em>, Elaine Svenonius deals with questions of this sort often in the context of library science. To figure out which features should be part of a biobliographic record, she lays out <em>principles of warrant</em> and uses them as criteria to  justify the inclusion or exclusion of information. We can do something similar, but because &apos;asking questions&apos; is such a broad thing it&apos;s not really possible to write out a complete set of principles. Rather I suspect that <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle"">the Pareto Rule</a> is in play and expecting <em>any justification</em> for questions does most of the work for us. Still, there are some principles of warrant that come to mind:</p><h3>Principle Of Confusion</h3><p>If two or more trustworthy models predict contradictory outcomes, <a href=""https://www.readthesequences.com/Noticing-Confusion-Sequence"">you are confused about a subject</a> and should be asking what the source of contradiction is. </p><h4>Principle Of Priors</h4><p>When we expect something to be true and find that observation or inference implies it isn&apos;t, <a href=""https://www.readthesequences.com/Your-Strength-As-A-Rationalist"">we should notice we&apos;re confused</a> and ask questions.</p><h3>Principle Of Pain</h3><p>Empirical observation of problems is a good reason to ask questions about why they occur and how they can be stopped.</p><h3>Principle Of Relation</h3><p>If you&apos;re already asking a question, it&apos;s often warranted to ask questions which are closeby in question-space. Be wary however that the principle of relation is fairly weak, and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon"">six degrees of kevin bacon</a> means that it can be used adversarially to shoehorn discussion of topics which wouldn&apos;t otherwise come up.</p><h3>Principle Of Balance</h3><p>When you ask a question, it&apos;s also often useful to ask its inverse.</p><h3>Principle Of Exhaustion</h3><p>If a question can be interpreted as belonging to a meaningful category, asking other questions in the same category can be useful to compare answers/etc.</p><p>This list is obviously not exhaustive, and memorizing it wouldn&apos;t be a good strategy for getting good at warrant.  Using warrant in practice is more like imagining some sense-data you would like to see. For example, if you&apos;re  <a href=""https://guides.library.harvard.edu/c.php?g=310271&amp;p=2071512"">reviewing the literature</a> on the procedure to induce Haitian voodoo spirit possession, what you&apos;re really asking is a question like &quot;Where in the world would I look to find information on this? Who would know about it? Where has information been left behind by the presence of this phenomena?&quot;. You might try anthropological accounts of voodoo practices, or hit up YouTube to see if an inconsiderate tourist has filmed the proceedings (or a nosy anthropologist). Getting good at thinking about where a phenomena would leave traces in the world lets you remove <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrees_of_freedom"">degrees of freedom</a> from your beliefs until they&apos;re tightly constrained by empirical observation; that is to say they have become thoroughly justified.</p>",ingres,ingres,namespace,

I lived in a world that was a no-world. I cannot hope to describe adequately that unconscious, yet conscious time of nothingness. I did not know that I knew aught, or that I lived or acted or desired. I had neither will nor intellect. I was carried along to objects and acts by a certain blind natural impetus. I had a mind which caused me to feel anger, satisfaction, desire. These two facts led those about me to suppose that I willed and thought. I can remember all this, not because I knew that it was so, but because I have tactual memory. It enables me to remember that I never contracted my forehead in the act of thinking. I never viewed anything beforehand or chose it. I also recall tactually the fact that never in a start of the body or a heart-beat did I feel that I loved or cared for anything. My inner life, then, was a blank without past, present, or future, without hope or anticipation, without wonder or joy or faith.</blockquote><blockquote>[...] </blockquote><blockquote>&#x2026; When I learned the meaning of &quot;I&quot; and &quot;me&quot; and found that I was something, I began to think. Then consciousness first existed for me. Thus it was not the sense of touch that brought me knowledge. It was the awakening of my soul that first rendered my senses their value, their cognizance of objects, names, qualities, and properties. Thought made me conscious of love, joy, and all the emotions. I was eager to know, then to understand, afterward to reflect on what I knew and understood, and the blind impetus, which had before driven me hither and thither at the dictates of my sensations, vanished forever.</blockquote><h3>Mastery of language may have conferred unique intellectual superpowers</h3><p>I think humans underwent a phase transition in their intellectual abilities when they came to master language, at which point their intellectual abilities jumped far beyond those of other animals on both an individual level and a species level. </p><p>On an individual level, our capacity for language enables us to entertain and express arbitrarily complex thoughts, which appears to be an ability unique to humans. In theoretical linguistics, this is referred to as &#x201C;<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_infinity"">digital infinity&#x201D;, or &#x201C;the infinite use of finite means&#x201D;</a>. </p><p>On a species level, our mastery of language enables intricate insights to accumulate over generations with high fidelity. Our ability to stand on the shoulders of giants is unique among animals, which is why our culture is unrivaled in its richness in sophistication. </p><h1>Language aside, how unique are humans? </h1><h3>Humans &#x2248; Neanderthals + language?</h3><p>The most quintessentially human intellectual accomplishments (e.g. proving theorems, composing symphonies, going into space) were only made possible by culture post-agricultural revolution. So, when evaluating humans&#x2019; innate intellectual capacities, a better reference point than modern humans like ourselves would be our hunter-gatherer ancestors. </p><p>We can reduce the question of how complex our hunter-gatherer ancestors&#x2019; brains are into two sub-questions: how complex is our capacity for mastering language, and how complex are brains that are similar to ours, but don&#x2019;t have the capacity for mastering language? </p><p>Neanderthal brains seem like plausible proxies for the latter. Neanderthals are similar enough to modern humans that <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4947341/"">they&#x2019;ve interbred</a>, and the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neanderthal_behavior"">currently available evidence</a> suggests that they may not have mastered language in the same way that <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_modernity"">behaviorally modern humans</a> have. (I don&#x2019;t think this evidence is very strong, but this doesn&#x2019;t matter for my purposes&#x2014;I&#x2019;m just using Neanderthals as a handy stand-in to gesture at what a human-like intelligence might look like if it didn&#x2019;t have the capacity for language.)</p><h3>Higher intelligence in animals</h3><p>Chimpanzees, crows, and dolphins are capable of impressive feats of higher intelligence, and I don&#x2019;t think there&#x2019;s any particular reason to think that Neanderthals are capable of doing anything qualitatively more impressive. I&#x2019;ll share some examples of these animals&#x2019; intellectual feats that I found particularly illustrative. </p><p>Chimpanzees have been observed to lie to each other under experimental conditions. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deception_in_animals#Tactical_deception"">From Wikipedia</a>:</p><blockquote>...food was hidden and only one individual, named Belle, in a group of chimpanzees was informed of the location. Belle was eager to lead the group to the food but when one chimpanzee, named Rock, began to refuse to share the food, Belle changed her behaviour. She began to sit on the food until Rock was far away, then she would uncover it quickly and eat it. Rock figured this out though and began to push her out of the way and take the food from under her. Belle then sat farther and farther away waiting for Rock to look away before she moved towards the food. In an attempt to speed the process up, Rock looked away until Belle began to run for the food. On several occasions he would even walk away, acting disinterested, and then suddenly spin around and run towards Belle just as she uncovered the food.</blockquote><p>In <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crow_and_the_Pitcher"">Aesop&#x2019;s fable of the crow and the pitcher</a>, a thirsty crow figures out that it can drop pebbles into a pitcher, so that the water rises to a high enough level for it to drink from. This behavior has been <a href=""https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0092895"">experimentally replicated</a>, indicating that crows have a &#x201C;sophisticated, but incomplete, understanding of the causal properties of displacement, rivalling that of 5&#x2013;7 year old children&#x201D;. </p><p>When <a href=""https://www.littlethings.com/brilliant-kelly-the-dolphin-fools-trainers/3"">Kelly the dolphin</a> was given rewards of fish for picking up scraps of paper, &#x201C;Kelly figured out that she received the same fish regardless of the size of the piece of trash she was delivering to her trainer. So she began hiding big pieces of trash under a rock. Kelly would then rip off small pieces from the trash and deliver them one at a time so that she could receive more fish.&#x201D; Additionally, &#x201C;when a bird landed in the pool, Kelly snatched it and delivered it to her trainers. She received a large amount of fish in return. Knowing this, she decided to start hiding fish each time she was fed. She would then use the fish to lure birds when none of her trainers were around. Kelly knew that by saving one or two fish now, she could get many more fish later by turning in a bird.&#x201C; (Also reported on <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/science/2003/jul/03/research.science?awc=11152_1585688382_de186cf736339cc47a455fe5a0cfd7da&amp;utm_source=afl&amp;utm_medium=awin&amp;utm_content=RockYou+Media"">The Guardian</a>; I don&#x2019;t know how reputable these sources are, so take this anecdote with a grain of salt.)</p><p>See <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool_use_by_animals"">these</a> <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deception_in_animals#Tactical_deception"">Wikipedia pages</a> for some more interesting examples, and see <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4650126/"">here</a> for a more thorough review of the evidence of higher intelligence in animals. </p><h3>&#x201C;Qualitatively&#x201D; more advanced cognition may emerge from scale</h3><p>Many aspects of human cognition that may appear qualitatively different from what other animals are capable of, such as long chains of abstract reasoning, also appear qualitatively different from what less intelligent humans are capable of. As a particularly extreme example, John von Neumann&#x2019;s <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann#Cognitive_abilities"">cognitive abilities</a> were so advanced that a Nobel Laureate, Hans Bethe, once remarked that &quot;[his] brain indicated a new species, an evolution beyond man&quot;. </p><p>At the same time, the genes that code for different humans&#x2019; brains are virtually identical from an evolutionary perspective. This suggests that the seemingly qualitative differences between humans&#x2019; and animals&#x2019; cognition might not be so different from the seemingly qualitative differences between John von Neumann&#x2019;s cognition and mine&#x2014;our brains might be doing essentially the same thing as theirs, except at a higher scale. </p><h1>How hard is mastery of language?</h1><h3>Could language capacity fall out from general capacities?</h3><p>Maybe it was extraordinarily difficult to evolve the cognitive mechanisms that allow us to learn language, above and beyond our cognitive machinery for learning other things. I think this is plausible, but I don&#x2019;t think the case for this is very strong. </p><p>Animals (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washoe_(chimpanzee)"">Washoe</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koko_(gorilla)"">Koko</a>, and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_(parrot)"">Alex the parrot</a>) have demonstrated the ability to learn simple forms of symbolic communication, which they never evolved to do, indicating that their ability to learn things in general is good enough to learn very simple forms of language. It&#x2019;s true that there are <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_language#Aspects_of_human_language"">aspects of human language that escape animals</a>, but they also escape <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_deprivation#Feral_children"">feral children</a>, and might escape animals for mundane reasons, like their not having <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_period#Linguistics"">critical periods</a> long enough to learn these aspects of language. </p><p>Additionally, <a href=""http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/"">AI language models</a> provide evidence that simple and general learning mechanisms can capture many of the intricacies of human language that other animals miss, further suggesting that there&#x2019;s nothing intrinsically difficult about learning language. Here&#x2019;s an excerpt from <a href=""https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/#sample1"">GPT-2</a>, a relatively recent language model: </p><blockquote>SYSTEM PROMPT (HUMAN-WRITTEN)</blockquote><blockquote>In a shocking finding, scientist discovered a herd of unicorns living in a remote, previously unexplored valley, in the Andes Mountains. Even more surprising to the researchers was the fact that the unicorns spoke perfect English.</blockquote><blockquote>MODEL COMPLETION (MACHINE-WRITTEN, 10 TRIES)</blockquote><blockquote>The scientist named the population, after their distinctive horn, Ovid&#x2019;s Unicorn. These four-horned, silver-white unicorns were previously unknown to science.</blockquote><blockquote>Now, after almost two centuries, the mystery of what sparked this odd phenomenon is finally solved.</blockquote><blockquote>Dr. Jorge P&#xE9;rez, an evolutionary biologist from the University of La Paz, and several companions, were exploring the Andes Mountains when they found a small valley, with no other animals or humans. P&#xE9;rez noticed that the valley had what appeared to be a natural fountain, surrounded by two peaks of rock and silver snow. </blockquote><blockquote>P&#xE9;rez and the others then ventured further into the valley. &#x201C;By the time we reached the top of one peak, the water looked blue, with some crystals on top,&#x201D; said P&#xE9;rez.</blockquote><h3>Why haven&#x2019;t other species mastered language? </h3><p>If language isn&#x2019;t a particularly difficult cognitive capacity to acquire, why don&#x2019;t we see more animal species with language? </p><p>One possibility is that the first species that masters language, by virtue of being able to access intellectual superpowers inaccessible to other animals, has a high probability of becoming the dominant species extremely quickly. (Humans underwent the agricultural revolution within 50,000 years of behavioral modernity&#x2014;a blink of an eye on evolutionary timescales&#x2014;after which their dominance as a species became unquestionable.) Since we shouldn&#x2019;t expect to see more than one dominant species at a time, this would imply a simple anthropic argument for our unique capacities for language: we shouldn&#x2019;t expect to see more than one species at a time with mastery of language, and we just happen to be the species that made it there first. </p><p>It may also turn out that language is hard to evolve not because it&#x2019;s a particularly sophisticated cognitive mechanism, but because the environments that could have supported language and selected for it might have been very unique. For example, it may be that a threshold of general intelligence has to be crossed before it&#x2019;s viable for a species to acquire language, and that humans are the only species to have crossed this threshold. (Humans do have the highest <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4685590/"">cortical information processing capacity</a> among mammals.)</p><p>It might also turn out that the cultural contexts under which language could evolve <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_of_language#Problems_of_reliability_and_deception"">require a mysteriously high degree of trust</a>: &#x201C;... language presupposes relatively high levels of mutual trust in order to become established over time as an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionarily_stable_strategy"">evolutionarily stable strategy</a>. This stability is born of a longstanding mutual trust and is what grants language its authority. A theory of the origins of language must therefore explain why humans could begin trusting cheap signals in ways that other animals apparently cannot (see <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signalling_theory"">signalling theory</a>).&#x201D; </p><h2>My current take</h2><p>As we came to master language, I think we underwent a phase transition in our intellectual abilities that set us apart from other animals. Besides language, I don&apos;t see much that sets us apart from other animals&#x2014;in particular, most other cognitive differences seem explainable as consequences of either language or scale, and I don&#x2019;t think the cognitive mechanisms that allow us to master language are particularly unique or difficult to acquire. Overall, I don&#x2019;t see much reason to believe that human brains have significantly more innate complexity than the brains of other animals. </p><br><p><em>Thanks to Paul Kreiner and Stag Lynn for helpful commentary and feedback. </em></p>",zhukeepa,zhukeepa,zhukeepa,

This episode is with Toby Ord and covers his new book &#x201C;The Precipice: Existential Risk and the Future of Humanity.&#x201D; This is a new cornerstone piece in the field of existential risk and I highly recommend this book for all persons of our day and age. I feel this work is absolutely critical reading for living an informed, reflective, and engaged life in our time. And I think even for those well acquainted with this topic area will find much that is both useful and new in this book. Toby offers a plethora of historical and academic context to the problem, tons of citations and endnotes, useful definitions, central arguments for why existential risk matters that can be really helpful for speaking to new people about this issue, and also novel quantitative analysis and risk estimations, as well as what we can actually do to help mitigate these risks.

Tell us a little bit about what the book is about.</p><p><strong>Toby Ord:</strong> The future of humanity, that&#x2019;s the guiding idea, and I try to think about how good our future could be. That&#x2019;s what really motivates me. I&#x2019;m really optimistic about the future we could have if only we survive the risks that we face. There have been various natural risks that we have faced for as long as humanity&#x2019;s been around, 200,000 years of Homo sapiens or you might include an even broader definition of humanity that&#x2019;s even longer. That&#x2019;s 2000 centuries and we know that those natural risks can&#x2019;t be that high or else we wouldn&#x2019;t have been able to survive so long. It&#x2019;s quite easy to show that the risks should be lower than about 1 in 1000 per century.</p><p>But then with humanity&#x2019;s increasing power over that time, the exponential increases in technological power. We reached this point last century with the development of nuclear weapons, where we pose a risk to our own survival and I think that the risks have only increased since then. We&#x2019;re in this new period where the risk is substantially higher than these background risks and I call this time the precipice. I think that this is a really crucial time in the history and the future of humanity, perhaps the most crucial time, this few centuries around now. And I think that if we survive, and people in the future, look back on the history of humanity, schoolchildren will be taught about this time. I think that this will be really more important than other times that you&#x2019;ve heard of such as the industrial revolution or even the agricultural revolution. I think this is a major turning point for humanity. And what we do now will define the whole future.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> In the title of your book, and also in the contents of it, you developed this image of humanity to be standing at the precipice, could you unpack this a little bit more? What does it mean for us to be standing at the precipice?</p><p><strong>Toby Ord:</strong> I sometimes think of humanity has this grand journey through the wilderness with dark times at various points, but also moments of sudden progress and heady views of the path ahead and what the future might hold. And I think that this point in time is the most dangerous time that we&#x2019;ve ever encountered, and perhaps the most dangerous time that there will ever be. So I see it in this central metaphor of the book, humanity coming through this high mountain pass and the only path onwards is this narrow ledge along a cliff side with this steep and deep precipice at the side and we&#x2019;re kind of inching our way along. But we can see that if we can get past this point, there&#x2019;s ultimately, almost no limits to what we could achieve. Even if we can&#x2019;t precisely estimate the risks that we face, we know that this is the most dangerous time so far. There&#x2019;s every chance that we don&#x2019;t make it through.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> Let&#x2019;s talk a little bit then about how we got to this precipice and our part in this path. Can you provide some examples or a story of global catastrophic risks that have happened and near misses of possible existential risks that have occurred so far?</p><p><strong>Toby Ord:</strong> It depends on your definition of global catastrophe. One of the definitions that&#x2019;s on offer is 10%, or more of all people on the earth at that time being killed in a single disaster. There is at least one time where it looks like we&#x2019;ve may have reached that threshold, which was the Black Death, which killed between a quarter and a half of people in Europe and may have killed many people in South Asia and East Asia as well and the Middle East. It may have killed one in 10 people across the whole world. Although because our world was less connected than it is today, it didn&#x2019;t reach every continent. In contrast, the Spanish Flu 1918 reached almost everywhere across the globe, and killed a few percent of people.</p><p>But in terms of existential risk, none of those really posed an existential risk. We saw, for example, that despite something like a third of people in Europe dying, that there wasn&#x2019;t a collapse of civilization. It seems like we&#x2019;re more robust than some give us credit for, but there&#x2019;ve been times where there hasn&#x2019;t been an actual catastrophe, but there&#x2019;s been near misses in terms of the chances.</p><p>There are many cases actually connected to the Cuban Missile Crisis, a time of immensely high tensions during the Cold War in 1962. I think that the closest we have come is perhaps the events on a submarine that was unknown to the U.S. that it was carrying a secret nuclear weapon and the U.S. Patrol Boats tried to force it to surface by dropping what they called practice depth charges, but the submarine thought that there were real explosives aimed at hurting them. The submarine was made for the Arctic and so it was overheating in the Caribbean. People were dropping unconscious from the heat and the lack of oxygen as they tried to hide deep down in the water. And during that time the captain, Captain Savitsky, ordered that this nuclear weapon be fired and the political officer gave his consent as well.</p><p>On any of the other submarines in this flotilla, this would have been enough to launch this torpedo that then would have been a tactical nuclear weapon exploding and destroying the fleet that was oppressing them, but on this one, it was lucky that the flotilla commander was also on board this submarine, Captain Vasili Arkhipov and so, he overruled this and talked Savitsky down from this. So this was a situation at the height of this tension where a nuclear weapon would have been used. And we&#x2019;re not quite sure, maybe Savitsky would have decided on his own not to do it, maybe he would have backed down. There&#x2019;s a lot that&#x2019;s not known about this particular case. It&#x2019;s very dramatic.</p><p>But Kennedy had made it very clear that any use of nuclear weapons against U.S. Armed Forces would lead to an all-out full scale attack on the Soviet Union, so they hadn&#x2019;t anticipated that tactical weapons might be used. They assumed it would be a strategic weapon, but it was their policy to respond with a full scale nuclear retaliation and it looks likely that that would have happened. So that&#x2019;s the case where ultimately zero people were killed in that event. The submarine eventually surfaced and surrendered and then returned to Moscow where people were disciplined, but it brought us very close to this full scale nuclear war.</p><p>I don&#x2019;t mean to imply that that would have been the end of humanity. We don&#x2019;t know whether humanity would survive the full scale nuclear war. My guess is that we would survive, but that&#x2019;s its own story and it&#x2019;s not clear.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> Yeah. The story to me has always felt a little bit unreal. It&#x2019;s hard to believe we came so close to something so bad. For listeners who are not aware, the Future of Life Institute gives out a $50,000 award each year, called the Future of Life Award to unsung heroes who have contributed greatly to the existential security of humanity. We actually have awarded Vasili Arkhipov&#x2019;s family with the Future of Life Award, as well as Stanislav Petrov and Matthew Meselson. So if you&#x2019;re interested, you can check those out on our website and see their particular contributions.</p><p>And related to nuclear weapons risk, we also have a webpage on nuclear close calls and near misses where there were accidents with nuclear weapons which could have led to escalation or some sort of catastrophe. Is there anything else here you&#x2019;d like to add in terms of the relevant historical context and this story about the development of our wisdom and power over time?</p><p><strong>Toby Ord:</strong> Yeah, that framing, which I used in the book comes from Carl Sagan in the &#x2019;80s when he was one of the people who developed the understanding of nuclear winter and he realized that this could pose a risk to humanity on the whole. The way he thought about it is that we&#x2019;ve had this massive development over the hundred billion human lives that have come before us. This succession of innovations that have accumulated building up this modern world around us.</p><p>If I look around me, I can see almost nothing that wasn&#x2019;t created by human hands and this, as we all know, has been accelerating and often when you try to measure exponential improvements in technology over time, leading to the situation where we have the power to radically reshape the Earth&#x2019;s surface, both say through our agriculture, but also perhaps in a moment through nuclear war. This increasing power has put us in a situation where we hold our entire future in the balance. A few people&#x2019;s actions over a few minutes could actually potentially threaten that entire future.</p><p>In contrast, humanity&#x2019;s wisdom has grown only falteringly, if at all. Many people would suggest that it&#x2019;s not even growing. And by wisdom here, I mean, our ability to make wise decisions for human future. I talked about this in the book under the idea about civilizational virtues. So if you think of humanity as a group of agents, in the same way that we think of say nation states as group agents, we talk about is it in America&#x2019;s interest to promote this trade policy or something like that? We can think of what&#x2019;s in humanity&#x2019;s interests and we find that if we think about it this way, humanity is crazily impatient and imprudent.</p><p>If you think about the expected lifespan of humanity, a typical species lives for about a million years. Humanity is about 200,000 years old. We have something like 800,000 or a million or more years ahead of us if we play our cards right and we don&#x2019;t lead to our own destruction. The analogy would be 20% of the way through our life, like an adolescent who&#x2019;s just coming into his or her own power, but doesn&#x2019;t have the wisdom or the patience to actually really pay any attention to this possible whole future ahead of them and so they&#x2019;re just powerful enough to get themselves in trouble, but not yet wise enough to avoid that.</p><p>If you continue this analogy, what is often hard for humanity at the moment to think more than a couple of election cycles ahead at best, but that would correspond say eight years to just the next eight hours within this person&#x2019;s life. For the kind of short term interests during the rest of the day, they put the whole rest of their future at risk. And so I think that that helps to see what this lack of wisdom looks like. It&#x2019;s not that it&#x2019;s just a highfalutin term of some sort, but you can kind of see what&#x2019;s going on is that the person is incredibly imprudent and impatient. And I think that many others virtues or vices that we think of in an individual human&#x2019;s life can be applied in this context and are actually illuminating about where we&#x2019;re going wrong.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> Wonderful. Part of the dynamic here in this wisdom versus power race seems to be one of the solutions being slowing down power seems untenable or that it just wouldn&#x2019;t work. So it seems more like we have to focus on amplifying wisdom. Is this also how you view the dynamic?</p><p><strong>Toby Ord:</strong> Yeah, that is. I think that if humanity was more coordinated, if we were able to make decisions in a unified manner better than we actually can. So, if you imagine this was a single player game, I don&#x2019;t think it would be that hard. You could just be more careful with your development of power and make sure that you invest a lot in institutions, and in really thinking carefully about things. I mean, I think that the game is ours to lose, but unfortunately, we&#x2019;re less coherent than that and if one country decides to hold off on developing things, then other countries might run ahead and produce similar amount of risk.</p><p>Theres this kind of the tragedy of the commons at this higher level and so I think that it&#x2019;s extremely difficult in practice for humanity to go slow on progress of technology. And I don&#x2019;t recommend that we try. So in particular, there&#x2019;s only at the moment, only a small number of people who really care about these issues and are really thinking about the long-term future and what we could do to protect it. And if those people were to spend their time arguing against progress of technology, I think that it would be a really poor use of their energies and probably just annoy and alienate the people they were trying to convince. And so instead, I think that the only real way forward is to focus on improving wisdom.</p><p>I don&#x2019;t think that&#x2019;s impossible. I think that humanity&#x2019;s wisdom, as you could see from my comment before about how we&#x2019;re kind of disunified, partly, it involves being able to think better about things as individuals, but it also involves being able to think better collectively. And so I think that institutions for overcoming some of these tragedies of the commons or prisoner&#x2019;s dilemmas at this international level, are an example of the type of thing that will make humanity make wiser decisions in our collective interest.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> It seemed that you said by analogy, that humanity&#x2019;s lifespan would be something like a million years as compared with other species.</p><p><strong>Toby Ord:</strong> Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> That is likely illustrative for most people. I think there&#x2019;s two facets of this that I wonder about in your book and in general. The first is this idea of reaching existential escape velocity, where it would seem unlikely that we would have a reason to end in a million years should we get through the time of the precipice and the second is I&#x2019;m wondering your perspective on Nick Bostrom calls what matters here in the existential condition, Earth-originating intelligent life. So, it would seem curious to suspect that even if humanity&#x2019;s existential condition were secure that we would still be recognizable as humanity in some 10,000, 100,000, 1 million years&#x2019; time and not something else. So, I&#x2019;m curious to know how the framing here functions in general for the public audience and then also being realistic about how evolution has not ceased to take place.</p><p><strong>Toby Ord:</strong> Yeah, both good points. I think that the one million years is indicative of how long species last when they&#x2019;re dealing with natural risks. It&#x2019;s I think a useful number to try to show why there are some very well-grounded scientific reasons for thinking that a million years is entirely in the ballpark of what we&#x2019;d expect if we look at other species. And even if you look at mammals or other hominid species, a million years still seems fairly typical, so it&#x2019;s useful in some sense for setting more of a lower bound. There are species which have survived relatively unchanged for much longer than that. One example is the horseshoe crab, which is about 450 million years old whereas complex life is only about 540 million years old. So that&#x2019;s something where it really does seem like it is possible to last for a very long period of time.</p><p>If you look beyond that the Earth should remain habitable for something in the order of 500 million or a billion years for complex life before it becomes too hot due to the continued brightening of our sun. If we took actions to limit that brightening, which look almost achievable with today&#x2019;s technology, we would only need to basically shade the earth by about 1% of the energy coming at it and increase that by 1%, I think it&#x2019;s every billion years, we will be able to survive as long as the sun would for about 7 billion more years. And I think that ultimately, we could survive much longer than that if we could reach our nearest stars and set up some new self-sustaining settlement there. And then if that could then spread out to some of the nearest stars to that and so on, then so long as we can reach about seven light years in one hop, we&#x2019;d be able to settle the entire galaxy. There are stars in the galaxy that will still be burning in about 10 trillion years from now and there&#x2019;ll be new stars for millions of times as long as that.</p><p>We could have this absolutely immense future in terms of duration and the technologies that are beyond our current reach and if you look at the energy requirements to reach nearby stars, they&#x2019;re high, but they&#x2019;re not that high compared to say, the output of the sun over millions of years. And if we&#x2019;re talking about a scenario where we&#x2019;d last millions of years anyway, it&#x2019;s unclear why it would be difficult with the technology would reach them. It seems like the biggest challenge would be lasting that long in the first place, not getting to the nearest star using technology for millions of years into the future with millions of years of stored energy reserves.</p><p>So that&#x2019;s the kind of big picture question about the timing there, but then you also ask about would it be humanity? One way to answer that is, unless we go to a lot of effort to preserve Homo sapiens as we are now then it wouldn&#x2019;t be Homo sapiens. We might go to that effort if we decide that it&#x2019;s really important that it be Homo sapiens and that we&#x2019;d lose something absolutely terrible. If we were to change, we could make that choice, but if we decide that it would be better to actually allow evolution to continue, or perhaps to direct it by changing who we are with genetic engineering and so forth, then we could make that choice as well. I think that that is a really critically important choice for the future and I hope that we make it in a very deliberate and careful manner rather than just going gung-ho and letting people do whatever they want, but I do think that we will develop into something else.</p><p>But in the book, my focus is often on humanity in this kind of broad sense. Earth-originating intelligent life would kind of be a gloss on it, but that has the issue that suppose humanity did go extinct and suppose we got lucky and some other intelligent life started off again, I don&#x2019;t want to count that in what I&#x2019;m talking about, even though it would technically fit into Earth-originating intelligent life. Sometimes I put it in the book as humanity or our rightful heirs something like that. Maybe we would create digital beings to replace us, artificial intelligences of some sort. So long as they were the kinds of beings that could actually fulfill the potential that we have, they could realize one of the best trajectories that we could possibly reach, then I would count them. It could also be that we create something that succeeds us, but has very little value, then I wouldn&#x2019;t count it.</p><p>So yeah, I do think that we may be greatly changed in the future. I don&#x2019;t want that to distract the reader, if they&#x2019;re not used to thinking about things like that because they might then think, &#x201C;Well, who cares about that future because it will be some other things having the future.&#x201D; And I want to stress that there will only be some other things having the future if we want it to be, if we make that choice. If that is a catastrophic choice, then it&#x2019;s another existential risk that we have to deal with in the future and which we could prevent. And if it is a good choice and we&#x2019;re like the caterpillar that really should become a butterfly in order to fulfill its potential, then we need to make that choice. So I think that is something that we can leave to future generations that it is important that they make the right choice.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> One of the things that I really appreciate about your book is that it tries to make this more accessible for a general audience. So, I actually do like it when you use lower bounds on humanity&#x2019;s existential condition. I think talking about billions upon billions of years can seem a little bit far out there and maybe costs some weirdness points and as much as I like the concept of Earth-originating intelligent life, I also think it costs some weirdness points.</p><p>And it seems like you&#x2019;ve taken some effort to sort of make the language not so ostracizing by decoupling it some with effective altruism jargon and the kind of language that we might use in effective altruism circles. I appreciate that and find it to be an important step. The same thing I feel feeds in here in terms of talking about descendant scenarios. It seems like making things simple and leveraging human self-interest is maybe important here.</p><p><strong>Toby Ord:</strong> Thanks. When I was writing the book, I tried really hard to think about these things, both in terms of communications, but also in terms of trying to understand what we have been talking about for all of these years when we&#x2019;ve been talking about existential risk and similar ideas. Often when in effective altruism, there&#x2019;s a discussion about the different types of cause areas that effective altruists are interested in. There&#x2019;s people who really care about global poverty, because we can help others who are much poorer than ourselves so much more with our money, and also about helping animals who are left out of the political calculus and the economic calculus and we can see why it is that they&#x2019;re interests are typically neglected and so we look at factory farms, and we can see how we could do so much good.</p><p>And then also there&#x2019;s this third group of people and then the conversation drifts off a bit, it&#x2019;s like who have this kind of idea about the future and it&#x2019;s kind of hard to describe and how to kind of wrap up together. So I&#x2019;ve kind of seen that as one of my missions over the last few years is really trying to work out what is it that that third group of people are trying to do? My colleague, Will MacAskill, has been working on this a lot as well. And what we see is that this other group of effective altruists are this long-termist group.</p><p>The first group is thinking about this cosmopolitan aspect as much as me and it&#x2019;s not just people in my country that matter, it&#x2019;s people across the whole world and some of those could be helped much more. And the second group is saying, it&#x2019;s not just humans that could be helped. If we widen things up beyond the species boundary, then we can see that there&#x2019;s so much more we could do for other conscious beings. And then this third group is saying, it&#x2019;s not just our time that we can help, there&#x2019;s so much we can do to help people perhaps across this entire future of millions of years or further into the future. And so the difference there, the point of leverage is this difference between what fraction of the entire future is our present generation is perhaps just a tiny fraction. And if we can do something that will help that entire future, then that&#x2019;s where this could be really key in terms of doing something amazing with our resources and our lives.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> Interesting. I actually had never thought of it that way. And I think it puts it really succinctly the differences between the different groups that people focused on global poverty are reducing spatial or proximity bias in people&#x2019;s focus on ethics or doing good. Animal farming is a kind of anti-speciesism, broadening our moral circle of compassion to other species and then the long-termism is about reducing time-based ethical bias. I think that&#x2019;s quite good.</p><p><strong>Toby Ord:</strong> Yeah, that&#x2019;s right. In all these cases, you have to confront additional questions. It&#x2019;s not just enough to make this point and then it follows that things are really important. You need to know, for example, that there really are ways that people can help others in distant countries and that the money won&#x2019;t be squandered. And in fact, for most of human history, there weren&#x2019;t ways that we could easily help people in other countries just by writing out a check to the right place.</p><p>When it comes to animals, there&#x2019;s a whole lot of challenging questions there about what is the effects of changing your diet or the effects of donating to a group that prioritize animals in campaigns against factory farming or similar and when it comes to the long-term future, there&#x2019;s this real question about &#x201C;Well, why isn&#x2019;t it that people in the future would be just as able to protect themselves as we are? Why wouldn&#x2019;t they be even more well-situated to attend to their own needs?&#x201D; Given the history of economic growth and this kind of increasing power of humanity, one would expect them to be more empowered than us, so it does require an explanation.</p><p>And I think that the strongest type of explanation is around existential risk. Existential risks are things that would be an irrevocable loss. So, as I define them, which is a simplification, I think of it as the destruction of humanity&#x2019;s long-term potential. So I think of our long term potential as you could think of this set of all possible futures that we could instantiate. If you think about all the different collective actions of humans that we could take across all time, this kind of sets out this huge kind of cloud of trajectories that humanity could go in and I think that this is absolutely vast. I think that there are ways if we play our cards right of lasting for millions of years or billions or trillions and affecting billions of different worlds across the cosmos, and then doing all kinds of amazing things with all of that future. So, we&#x2019;ve got this huge range of possibilities at the moment and I think that some of those possibilities are extraordinarily good.</p><p>If we were to go extinct, though, that would collapse this set of possibilities to a much smaller set, which contains much worse possibilities. If we went extinct, there would be just one future, whatever it is that would happen without humans, because there&#x2019;d be no more choices that humans could make. If we had an irrevocable collapse of civilization, something from which we could never recover, then that would similarly reduce it to a very small set of very meager options. And it&#x2019;s possible as well that we could end up locked into some dystopian future, perhaps through economic or political systems, where we end up stuck in some very bad corner of this possibility space. So that&#x2019;s our potential. Our potential is currently the value of the best realistically realizable worlds available to us.</p><p>If we fail in an existential catastrophe, that&#x2019;s the destruction of almost all of this value, and it&#x2019;s something that you can never get back, because it&#x2019;s our very potential that would be being destroyed. That then has an explanation as to why it is that people in the future wouldn&#x2019;t be better able to solve their own problems because we&#x2019;re talking about things that could fail now, that helps explain why it is that there&#x2019;s room for us to make such a contribution.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> So if we were to very succinctly put the recommended definition or framing on existential risk that listeners might be interested in using in the future when explaining this to new people, what is the sentence that you would use?</p><p><strong>Toby Ord:</strong> An existential catastrophe is the destruction of humanity&#x2019;s long-term potential, and an existential risk is the risk of such a catastrophe.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> Okay, so on this long-termism point, can you articulate a little bit more about what is so compelling or important about humanity&#x2019;s potential into the deep future and which arguments are most compelling to you with a little bit of a framing here on the question of whether or not the long-termist&#x2019;s perspective is compelling or motivating for the average person like, why should I care about people who are far away in time from me?</p><p><strong>Toby Ord:</strong> So, I think that a lot of people if pressed and they&#x2019;re told &#x201C;does it matter equally much if a child 100 years in the future suffers as a child at some other point in time?&#x201D; I think a lot of people would say, &#x201C;Yeah, it matters just as much.&#x201D; But that&#x2019;s not how we normally think of things when we think about what charity to donate to or what policies to implement, but I do think that it&#x2019;s not that foreign of an idea. In fact, the weird thing would be why it is that people in virtue of the fact that they live in different times matter different amounts.</p><p>A simple example of that would be suppose you do think that things further into the future matter less intrinsically. Economists sometimes represent this by a pure rate of time preference. It&#x2019;s a component of a discount rate, which is just to do with things mattering less in the future, whereas most of the discount rate is actually to do with the fact that money is more important to have earlier which is actually a pretty solid reason, but that component doesn&#x2019;t affect any of these arguments. It&#x2019;s only this little extra aspect about things matter less just because we&#x2019;re in the future. Suppose you have that 1% discount rate of that form. That means that someone&#x2019;s older brother matters more than their younger brother, that their life is equally long and has the same kinds of experiences is fundamentally more important for their older child than the younger child, things like that. This just seems kind of crazy to most people, I think.</p><p>And similarly, if you have these exponential discount rates, which is typically the only kind that economists consider, it has these consequences that what happens in 10,000 years is way more important than what happens in 11,000 years. People don&#x2019;t have any intuition like that at all, really. Maybe we don&#x2019;t think that much about what happens in 10,000 years, but 11,000 is pretty much the same as 10,000 from our intuition, but these other views say, &#x201C;Wow. No, it&#x2019;s totally different. It&#x2019;s just like the difference between what happens next year and what happens in a thousand years.&#x201D;</p><p>It generally just doesn&#x2019;t capture our intuitions and I think that what&#x2019;s going on is not so much that we have a kind of active intuition that things that happen further into the future matter less and in fact, much less because they would have to matter a lot less to dampen the fact that we can have millions of years of future. Instead, what&#x2019;s going on is that we just aren&#x2019;t thinking about it. We&#x2019;re not really considering that our actions could have irrevocable effects over the long distant future. And when we do think about that, such as within environmentalism, it&#x2019;s a very powerful idea. The idea that we shouldn&#x2019;t sacrifice, we shouldn&#x2019;t make irrevocable changes to the environment that could damage the entire future just for transient benefits to our time. And people think, &#x201C;Oh, yeah, that is a powerful idea.&#x201D;</p><p>So I think it&#x2019;s more that they&#x2019;re just not aware that there are a lot of situations like this. It&#x2019;s not just the case of a particular ecosystem that could be an example of one of these important irrevocable losses, but there could be these irrevocable losses at this much grander scale affecting everything that we could ever achieve and do. I should also explain there that I do talk a lot about humanity in the book. And the reason I say this is not because I think that non-human animals don&#x2019;t count or they don&#x2019;t have intrinsic value, I do. It&#x2019;s because instead, only humanity is responsive to reasons and to thinking about this. It&#x2019;s not the case that chimpanzees will choose to save other species from extinction and will go out and work out how to safeguard them from natural disasters that could threaten their ecosystems or things like that.</p><p>We&#x2019;re the only ones who are even in the game of considering moral choices. So in terms of the instrumental value, humanity has this massive instrumental value, because what we do could affect, for better or for worse, the intrinsic value of all of the other species. Other species are going to go extinct in about a billion years, basically, all of them when the earth becomes uninhabitable. Only humanity could actually extend that lifespan. So there&#x2019;s this kind of thing where humanity ends up being key because we are the decision makers. We are the relevant agents or any other relevant agents will spring from us. That will be things that our descendants or things that we create and choose how they function. So, that&#x2019;s the kind of role that we&#x2019;re playing.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> So if there are people who just simply care about the short term, if someone isn&#x2019;t willing to buy into these arguments about the deep future or realizing the potential of humanity&#x2019;s future, like &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t care so much about that, because I won&#x2019;t be alive for that.&#x201D; There&#x2019;s also an argument here that these risks may be realized within their lifetime or within their children&#x2019;s lifetime. Could you expand that a little bit?</p><p><strong>Toby Ord:</strong> Yeah, in the precipice, when I try to think about why this matters. I think the most obvious reasons are rooted in the present. The fact that it will be terrible for all of the people who are alive at the time when the catastrophe strikes. That needn&#x2019;t be the case. You could imagine things that meet my definition of an existential catastrophe that it would cut off the future, but not be bad for the people who were alive at that time, maybe we all painlessly disappear at the end of our natural lives or something. But in almost all realistic scenarios that we&#x2019;re thinking about, it would be terrible for all of the people alive at that time, they would have their lives cut short and witness the downfall of everything that they&#x2019;ve ever cared about and believed in.</p><p>That&#x2019;s a very obvious natural reason, but the reason that moves me the most is thinking about our long-term future, and just how important that is. This huge scale of everything that we could ever become. And you could think of that in very numerical terms or you could just think back over time and how far humanity has come over these 200,000 years. Imagine that going forward and how small a slice of things our own lives are and you can come up with very intuitive arguments to exceed that as well. It doesn&#x2019;t have to just be multiply things out type argument.</p><p>But then I also think that there are very strong arguments that you could also have rooted in our past and in other things as well. Humanity has succeeded and has got to where we are because of this partnership of the generations. Edmund Burke had this phrase. It&#x2019;s something where, if we couldn&#x2019;t promulgate our ideas and innovations to the next generation, what technological level would be like. It would be like it was in the Paleolithic time, even a crude iron shovel would be forever beyond our reach. It was only through passing down these innovations and iteratively improving upon them, we could get billions of people working in cooperation over deep time to build this world around us.</p><p>If we think about the wealth and prosperity that we have the fact that we live as long as we do. This is all because this rich world was created by our ancestors and handed on to us and we&#x2019;re the trustees of this vast inheritance and if we would have failed, if we&#x2019;d be the first of 10,000 generations to fail to pass this on to our heirs, we will be the worst of all of these generations. We&#x2019;d have failed in these very important duties and these duties could be understood as some kind of reciprocal duty to those people in the past or we could also consider it as duties to the future rooted in obligations to people in the past, because we can&#x2019;t reciprocate to people who are no longer with us. The only kind of way you can get this to work is to pay it forward and have this system where we each help the next generation with the respect for the past generations.</p><p>So I think there&#x2019;s another set of reasons more deontological type reasons for it and you could all have the reasons I mentioned in terms of civilizational virtues and how that kind of approach rooted in being a more virtuous civilization or species and I think that that is a powerful way of seeing it as well, to see that we&#x2019;re very impatient and imprudent and so forth and we need to become more wise or alternatively, Max Tegmark has talked about this and Martin Rees, Carl Sagan and others have seen it as something based on a cosmic significance of humanity, that perhaps in all of the stars and all of the galaxies of the universe, perhaps this is the only place where there is either life at all or we&#x2019;re the only place where there&#x2019;s intelligent life or consciousness. There&#x2019;s different versions of this and that could make this exceptionally important place and this very rare thing that could be forever gone.</p><p>So I think that there&#x2019;s a whole lot of different reasons here and I think that previously, a lot of the discussion has been in a very technical version of the future directed one where people have thought, well, even if there&#x2019;s only a tiny chance of extinction, our future could have 10 to the power of 30 people in it or something like that. There&#x2019;s something about this argument that some people find it compelling, but not very many. I personally always found it a bit like a trick. It is a little bit like an argument that zero equals one where you don&#x2019;t find it compelling, but if someone says point out the step where it goes wrong, you can&#x2019;t see a step where the argument goes wrong, but you still think I&#x2019;m not very convinced, there&#x2019;s probably something wrong with this.</p><p>And then people who are not from the sciences, people from the humanities find it an actively alarming argument that anyone who would make moral decisions on the grounds of an argument like that. What I&#x2019;m trying to do is to show that actually, there&#x2019;s this whole cluster of justifications rooted in all kinds of principles that many people find reasonable and you don&#x2019;t have to accept all of them by any means. The idea here is that if any one of these arguments works for you, then you can see why it is that you have reasons to care about not letting our future be destroyed in our time.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> Awesome. So, there&#x2019;s first this deontological argument about transgenerational duties to continue propagating the species and the projects and value which previous generations have cultivated. We inherit culture and art and literature and technology, so there is a duties-based argument to continue the stewardship and development of that. There is this cosmic significance based argument that says that consciousness may be extremely precious and rare, and that there is great value held in the balance here at the precipice on planet Earth and it&#x2019;s important to guard and do the proper stewardship of that.</p><p>There is this short-term argument that says that there is some reasonable likelihood I think, total existential risk for the next century you put at one in six, which we can discuss a little bit more later, so that would also be very bad for us and our children and short-term descendants should that be realized in the next century. Then there is this argument about the potential of humanity in deep time. So I think we&#x2019;ve talked a bit here about there being potentially large numbers of human beings in the future or our descendants or other things that we might find valuable, but I don&#x2019;t think that we&#x2019;ve touched on the part and change of quality.</p><p>There are these arguments on quantity, but there&#x2019;s also I think, I really like how David Pearce puts it where he says, &#x201C;One day we may have thoughts as beautiful as sunsets.&#x201D; So, could you expand a little bit here this argument on quality that I think also feeds in and then also with regards to the digitalization aspect that may happen, that there are also arguments around subjective time dilation, which may lead to more better experience into the deep future. So, this also seems to be another important aspect that&#x2019;s motivating for some people.</p><p><strong>Toby Ord:</strong> Yeah. Humanity has come a long way and various people have tried to catalog the improvements in our lives over time. Often in history, this is not talked about, partly because history is normally focused on something of the timescale of a human life and things don&#x2019;t change that much on that timescale, but when people are thinking about much longer timescales, I think they really do. Sometimes this is written off in history as Whiggish history, but I think that that&#x2019;s a mistake.</p><p>I think that if you were to summarize the history of humanity in say, one page, I think that the dramatic increases in our quality of life and our empowerment would have to be mentioned. It&#x2019;s so important. You probably wouldn&#x2019;t mention the Black Death, but you would mention this. Yet, it&#x2019;s very rarely talked about within history, but there are people talking about it and there are people who have been measuring these improvements. And I think that you can see how, say in the last 200 years, lifespans have more than doubled and in fact, even in the poorest countries today, lifespans are longer than they were in the richest countries 200 years ago.</p><p>We can now almost all read whereas very few people could read 200 years ago. We&#x2019;re vastly more wealthy. If you think about this threshold we currently use of extreme poverty, it used to be the case 200 years ago that almost everyone was below that threshold. People were desperately poor and now almost everyone is above that threshold. There&#x2019;s still so much more that we could do, but there have been these really dramatic improvements.</p><p>Some people seem to think that that story of well-being in our lives getting better, increasing freedoms, increasing empowerment of education and health, they think that that story runs somehow counter to their concern about existential risk that one is an optimistic story and one&#x2019;s a gloomy story. Ultimately, what I&#x2019;m thinking is that it&#x2019;s because these trends seem to point towards very optimistic futures that would make it all the more important to ensure that we survive to reach such futures. If all the trends suggested that the future was just going to inevitably move towards a very dreary thing that had hardly any value in it, then I wouldn&#x2019;t be that concerned about existential risk, so I think these things actually do go together.</p><p>And it&#x2019;s not just in terms of our own lives that things have been getting better. We&#x2019;ve been making major institutional reforms, so while there is regrettably still slavery in the world today, there is much less than there was in the past and we have been making progress in a lot of ways in terms of having a more representative and more just and fair world and there&#x2019;s a lot of room to continue in both those things. And even then, a world that&#x2019;s kind of like the best lives lived today, a world that has very little injustice or suffering, that&#x2019;s still only a lower bound on what we could achieve.</p><p>I think one useful way to think about this is in terms of your peak experiences. These moments of luminous joy or beauty, the moments that you&#x2019;ve been happiest, whatever they may be and you think about how much better they are than the typical moments. My typical moments are by no means bad, but I would trade hundreds or maybe thousands for more of these peak experiences, and that&#x2019;s something where there&#x2019;s no fundamental reason why we couldn&#x2019;t spend much more of our lives at these peaks and have lives which are vastly better than our lives are today and that&#x2019;s assuming that we don&#x2019;t find even higher peaks and new ways to have even better lives.</p><p>It&#x2019;s not just about the well-being in people&#x2019;s lives either. If you have any kind of conception about the types of value that humanity creates, so much of our lives will be in the future, so many of our achievements will be in the future, so many of our societies will be in the future. There&#x2019;s every reason to expect that these greatest successes in all of these different ways will be in this long future as well. There&#x2019;s also a host of other types of experiences that might become possible. We know that humanity only has some kind of very small sliver of the space of all possible experiences. We see in a set of colors, this three-dimensional color space.</p><p>We know that there are animals that see additional color pigments, that can see ultraviolet, can see parts of reality that we&#x2019;re blind to. Animals with magnetic sense that can sense what direction north is and feel the magnetic fields. What&#x2019;s it like to experience things like that? We could go so much further exploring this space. If we can guarantee our future and then we can start to use some of our peak experiences as signposts to what might be experienceable, I think that there&#x2019;s so much further that we could go.</p><p>And then I guess you mentioned the possibilities of digital things as well. We don&#x2019;t know exactly how consciousness works. In fact, we know very little about how it works. We think that there&#x2019;s some suggestive reasons to think that minds including consciousness are computational things such that we might be able to realize them digitally and then there&#x2019;s all kinds of possibilities that would follow from that. You could slow yourself down like slow down the rate at which you&#x2019;re computed in order to see progress zoom past you and kind of experience a dizzying rate of change in the things around you. Fast forwarding through the boring bits and skipping to the exciting bits one&#x2019;s life if one was digital could potentially be immortal, have backup copies, and so forth.</p><p>You might even be able to branch into being two different people, have some choice coming up as to say whether to stay on earth or to go to this new settlement in the stars, and just split with one copy go into this new life and one staying behind or a whole lot of other possibilities. We don&#x2019;t know if that stuff is really possible, but it&#x2019;s just to kind of give a taste of how we might just be seeing this very tiny amount of what&#x2019;s possible at the moment.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> This is one of the most motivating arguments for me, the fact that the space of all possible minds is probably very large and deep and that the kinds of qualia that we have access to are very limited and the possibility of well-being not being contingent upon the state of the external world which is always in flux and is always impermanent, we&#x2019;re able to have a science of well-being that was sufficiently well-developed such that well-being was information and decision sensitive, but not contingent upon the state of the external world that seems like a form of enlightenment in my opinion.</p><p><strong>Toby Ord:</strong> Yeah. Some of these questions are things that you don&#x2019;t often see discussed in academia, partly because there isn&#x2019;t really a proper discipline that says that that&#x2019;s the kind of thing you&#x2019;re allowed to talk about in your day job, but it is the kind of thing that people are allowed to talk about in science fiction. Many science fiction authors have something more like space opera or something like that where the future is just an interesting setting to play out the dramas that we recognize.</p><p>But other people use the setting to explore radical, what if questions, many of which are very philosophical and some of which are very well done. I think that if you&#x2019;re interested in these types of questions, I would recommend people read Diaspora by Greg Egan, which I think is the best and most radical exploration of this and at the start of the book, it&#x2019;s a setting in a particular digital system with digital minds substantially in the future from where we are now that have been running much faster than the external world. Their lives lived thousands of times faster than the people who&#x2019;ve remained flesh and blood, so culturally that vastly further on, and then you get to witness what it might be like to undergo various of these events in one&#x2019;s life. And in the particular setting it&#x2019;s in. It&#x2019;s a world where physical violence is against the laws of physics.</p><p>So rather than creating utopia by working out how to make people better behaved, the longstanding project have tried to make us all act nicely and decently to each other. That&#x2019;s clearly part of what&#x2019;s going on, but there&#x2019;s this extra possibility that most people hadn&#x2019;t even thought about, where because it&#x2019;s all digital. It&#x2019;s kind of like being on a web forum or something like that, where if someone attempts to attack you, you can just make them disappear, so that they can no longer interfere with you at all. And it explores what life might be like in this kind of world where the laws of physics are consent based and you can just make it so that people have no impact on you if you&#x2019;re not enjoying the kind of impact that they&#x2019;re having is a fascinating setting to explore radically different ideas about the future, which very much may not come to pass.</p><p>But what I find exciting about these types of things is not so much that they&#x2019;re projections of where the future will be, but that if you take a whole lot of examples like this, they span a space that&#x2019;s much broader than you were initially thinking about for your probability distribution over where the future might go and they help you realize that there are radically different ways that it could go. This kind of expansion of your understanding about the space of possibilities, which is where I think it&#x2019;s best as opposed to as a direct prediction that I would strongly recommend some Greg Egan for anyone who wants to get really into that stuff.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> You sold me. I&#x2019;m interested in reading it now. I&#x2019;m also becoming mindful of our time here and have a bunch more questions I would like to get through, but before we do that, I also want to just throw out here. I&#x2019;ve had a bunch of conversations recently on the question of identity and open individualism and closed individualism and empty individualism are some of the views here.</p><p>For the long-termist perspective, I think that it&#x2019;s pretty much very or deeply informative for how much or how little one may care about the deep future or digital minds or our descendants in a million years or humans that are around a million years later. I think for many people who won&#x2019;t be motivated by these arguments, they&#x2019;ll basically just feel like it&#x2019;s not me, so who cares? And so I feel like these questions on personal identity really help tug and push and subvert many of our commonly held intuitions about identity. So, sort of going off of your point about the potential of the future and how it&#x2019;s quite beautiful and motivating.</p><p>A little funny quip or thought there is I&#x2019;ve sprung into Lucas consciousness and I&#x2019;m quite excited, whatever &#x201C;I&#x201D; means, for there to be like awakening into Dyson sphere consciousness in Andromeda or something, and maybe a bit of a wacky or weird idea for most people, but thinking more and more endlessly about the nature of personal identity makes thoughts like these more easily entertainable.</p><p><strong>Toby Ord:</strong> Yeah, that&#x2019;s interesting. I haven&#x2019;t done much research on personal identity. In fact, the types of questions I&#x2019;ve been thinking about when it comes to the book are more on how radical change would be needed before it&#x2019;s no longer humanity, so kind of like the identity of humanity across time as opposed to the identity for a particular individual across time. And because I&#x2019;m already motivated by helping others and I&#x2019;m kind of thinking more about the question of why just help others in our own time as opposed to helping others across time. How do you direct your altruism, your altruistic impulses?</p><p>But you&#x2019;re right that they could also be possibilities to do with individuals lasting into the future. There&#x2019;s various ideas about how long we can last with lifespans extending very rapidly. It might be that some of the people who are alive now actually do directly experience some of this long-term future. Maybe there are things that could happen where their identity wouldn&#x2019;t be preserved, because it&#x2019;d be too radical a break. You&#x2019;d become two different kinds of being and you wouldn&#x2019;t really be the same person, but if being the same person is important to you, then maybe you could make smaller changes. I&#x2019;ve barely looked into this at all. I know Nick Bostrom has thought about it more. There&#x2019;s probably lots of interesting questions there.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> Awesome. So could you give a short overview of natural or non-anthropogenic risks over the next century and why they&#x2019;re not so important?</p><p><strong>Toby Ord:</strong> Yeah. Okay, so the main natural risks I think we&#x2019;re facing are probably asteroid or comet impacts and super volcanic eruptions. In the book, I also looked at stellar explosions like supernova and gamma ray bursts, although since I estimate the chance of us being wiped out by one of those in the next 100 years to be one in a billion, we don&#x2019;t really need to worry about those.</p><p>But asteroids, it does appear that the dinosaurs were destroyed 65 million years ago by a major asteroid impact. It&#x2019;s something that&#x2019;s been very well studied scientifically. I think the main reason to think about it is A, because it&#x2019;s very scientifically understood and B, because humanity has actually done a pretty good job on it. We only worked out 40 years ago that the dinosaurs were destroyed by an asteroid and that they could be capable of causing such a mass extinction. In fact, it was only in 1960, 60 years ago that we even confirmed that craters on the Earth&#x2019;s surface were caused by asteroids. So we knew very little about this until recently.</p><p>And then we&#x2019;ve massively scaled up our scanning of the skies. We think that in order to cause a global catastrophe, the asteroid would probably need to be bigger than a kilometer across. We&#x2019;ve found about 95% of the asteroids between 1 and 10 kilometers across, and we think we&#x2019;ve found all of the ones bigger than 10 kilometers across. We therefore know that since none of the ones were found are on a trajectory to hit us within the next 100 years that it looks like we&#x2019;re very safe from asteroids.</p><p>Whereas super volcanic eruptions are much less well understood. My estimate for those for the chance that we could be destroyed in the next 100 years by one is about one in 10,000. In the case of asteroids, we have looked into it so carefully and we&#x2019;ve managed to check whether any are coming towards us right now, whereas it can be hard to get these probabilities further down until we know more, so that&#x2019;s why my what about the super volcanic corruptions is where it is. That the Toba eruption was some kind of global catastrophe a very long time ago, though the early theories that it might have caused a population bottleneck and almost destroyed humanity, they don&#x2019;t seem to hold up anymore. It is still illuminating of having continent scale destruction and global cooling.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> And so what is your total estimation of natural risk in the next century?</p><p><strong>Toby Ord:</strong> About one in 10,000. All of these estimates are in order of magnitude estimates, but I think that it&#x2019;s about the same level as I put the super volcanic eruption and the other known natural risks I would put as much smaller. One of the reasons that we can say these low numbers is because humanity has survived for 2000 centuries so far, and related species such as Homo erectus have survived for even longer. And so we just know that there can&#x2019;t be that many things that could destroy all humans on the whole planet from these natural risks,</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> Right, the natural conditions and environment hasn&#x2019;t changed so much.</p><p><strong>Toby Ord:</strong> Yeah, that&#x2019;s right. I mean, this argument only works if the risk has either been constant or expectably constant, so it could be that it&#x2019;s going up and down, but we don&#x2019;t know which then it will also work. The problem is if we have some pretty good reasons to think that the risks could be going up over time, then our long track record is not so helpful. And that&#x2019;s what happens when it comes to what you could think of as natural pandemics, such as the coronavirus.</p><p>This is something where it&#x2019;s got into humanity through some kind of human action, so it&#x2019;s not exactly natural how it actually got into humanity in the first place and then its spread through humanity through airplanes, traveling to different continents very quickly, is also not natural and is a faster spread than you would have had over this long-term history of humanity. And thus, these kind of safety arguments don&#x2019;t count as well as they would for things like asteroid impacts.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> This class of risks then is risky, but less risky than the human-made risks, which are a result of technology, the fancy x-risk jargon for this is anthropogenic risks. Some of these are nuclear weapons, climate change, environmental damage, synthetic bio-induced pandemics or AI-enabled pandemics, unaligned artificial intelligence, dystopian scenarios and other risks. Could you say a little bit about each of these and why you view unaligned artificial intelligence as the biggest risk?</p><p><strong>Toby Ord:</strong> Sure. Some of these anthropogenic risks we already face. Nuclear war is an example. What is particularly concerning is a very large scale nuclear war, such as between the U.S. and Russia and nuclear winter models have suggested that the soot from burning buildings could get lifted up into the stratosphere which is high enough that it wouldn&#x2019;t get rained out, so it could stay in the upper atmosphere for a decade or more and cause widespread global cooling, which would then cause massive crop failures, because there&#x2019;s not enough time between frosts to get a proper crop, and thus could lead to massive starvation and a global catastrophe.</p><p>Carl Sagan suggested it could potentially lead to our extinction, but the current people working on this, while they are very concerned about it, don&#x2019;t suggest that it could lead to human extinction. That&#x2019;s not really a scenario that they find very likely. And so even though I think that there is substantial risk of nuclear war over the next century, either an accidental nuclear war being triggered soon or perhaps a new Cold War, leading to a new nuclear war, I would put the chance that humanity&#x2019;s potential is destroyed through nuclear war at about one in 1000 over the next 100 years, which is about where I&#x2019;d put it for climate change as well.</p><p>There is debate as to whether climate change could really cause human extinction or a permanent collapse of civilization. I think the answer is that we don&#x2019;t know. Similar with nuclear war, but they&#x2019;re both such large changes to the world, these kind of unprecedentedly rapid and severe changes that it&#x2019;s hard to be more than 99% confident that if that happens that we&#x2019;d make it through and so this is difficult to eliminate risk that remains there.</p><p>In the book, I look at the very worst climate outcomes, how much carbon is there in the methane clathrates under the ocean and in the permafrost? What would happen if it was released? How much warming would there be? And then what would happen if you had very severe amounts of warming such as 10 degrees? And I try to sketch out what we know about those things and it is difficult to find direct mechanisms that suggests that we would go extinct or that we would collapse our civilization in a way from which you could never be restarted again, despite the fact that civilization arose five times independently in different parts of the worlds already, so we know that it&#x2019;s not like a fluke to get it started again. So it&#x2019;s difficult to see the direct reasons why it could happen, but we don&#x2019;t know enough to be sure that it can&#x2019;t happen. In my sense, that&#x2019;s still an existential risk.</p><p>Then I also have a kind of catch all for other types of environmental damage, all of these other pressures that we&#x2019;re putting on the planet. I think that it would be too optimistic to be sure that none of those could potentially cause a collapse from which we can never recover as well. Although when I look at particular examples that are suggested, such as the collapse of pollinating insects and so forth, for the particular things that are suggested, it&#x2019;s hard to see how they could cause this, so it&#x2019;s not that I am just seeing problems everywhere, but I do think that there&#x2019;s something to this general style of argument that unknown effects of the stressors we&#x2019;re putting on the planet could be the end for us.</p><p>So I&#x2019;d put all of those kind of current types of risks at about one in 1,000 over the next 100 years, but then it&#x2019;s the anthropogenic risks from technologies that are still on the horizon that scare me the most and this would be in keeping with this idea of humanity&#x2019;s continued exponential growth in power where you&#x2019;d expect the risks to be escalating every century. And I think that the ones that I&#x2019;m most concerned about, in particular, engineered pandemics and the risk of unaligned artificial intelligence.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> All right. I think listeners will be very familiar with many of the arguments around why unaligned artificial intelligence is dangerous, so I think that we could skip some of the crucial considerations there. Could you touch a little bit then on the risks of engineered pandemics, which may be more new and then give a little bit of your total risk estimate for this class of risks.</p><p><strong>Toby Ord:</strong> Ultimately, we do have some kind of a safety argument in terms of the historical record when it comes to these naturally arising pandemics. There are ways that they could be more dangerous now than they could have been in the past, but there are also many ways in which they&#x2019;re less dangerous. We have antibiotics. We have the ability to detect in real time these threats, sequence the DNA of the things that are attacking us, and then use our knowledge of quarantine and medicine in order to fight them. So we have reasons to look to our safety on that.</p><p>But there are cases of pandemics or pandemic pathogens being created to be even more spreadable or even more deadly than those that arise naturally because the natural ones are not being optimized to be deadly. The deadliness is only if that&#x2019;s in service of them spreading and surviving and normally killing your host is a big problem for that. So there&#x2019;s room there for people to try to engineer things to be worse than the natural ones.</p><p>One case is scientists looking to fight disease, like Ron Fouchier with the bird flu, deliberately made a more infectious version of it that could be transmitted directly from mammal to mammal. He did that because he was trying to help, but it was, I think, very risky and I think a very bad move and most of the scientific community didn&#x2019;t think it was a good idea. He did it in a bio safety level three enhanced lab, which is not the highest level of biosecurity, that&#x2019;s BSL four, and even at the highest level, there have been an escape of a pathogen from a BSL four facility. So these labs aren&#x2019;t safe enough, I think, to be able to work on newly enhanced things that are more dangerous than anything that nature can create in a world where so far the biggest catastrophes that we know of were caused by pandemics. So I think that it&#x2019;s pretty crazy to be working on such things until we have labs from which nothing has ever escaped.</p><p>But that&#x2019;s not what really worries me. What worries me more is bio weapons programs and there&#x2019;s been a lot of development of bio weapons in the 20th Century, in particular. The Soviet Union reportedly had 20 tons of smallpox that they had manufactured for example, and they had an accidental release of smallpox, which killed civilians in Russia. They had an accidental release of anthrax, blowing it out across the whole city and killing many people, so we know from cases like this, that they had a very large bioweapons program. And the Biological Weapons Convention, which is the leading institution at an international level to prohibit bio weapons is chronically underfunded and understaffed. The entire budget of the BWC is less than that of a typical McDonald&#x2019;s.</p><p>So this is something where humanity doesn&#x2019;t have its priorities in order. Countries need to work together to step that up and to give it more responsibilities, to actually do inspections and make sure that none of them are using bio weapons. And then I&#x2019;m also really concerned by the dark side of the democratization of biotechnology. The fact that rapid developments that we make with things like Gene Drives and CRISPR. These two huge breakthroughs. They&#x2019;re perhaps Nobel Prize worthy. That in both cases within two years, they are replicated by university students in science competitions.</p><p>So we now have a situation where two years earlier, there&#x2019;s like one person in the world who could do it or no one who could do it, then one person and then within a couple of years, we have perhaps tens of thousands of people who could do it, soon millions. And so if that pool of people eventually includes people like those in the Aum Shinrikyo cults that was responsible for the Sarin gas in the Tokyo subway, who actively one of their goals was to destroy everyone in the world. Once enough people can do these things and could make engineered pathogens, you&#x2019;ll get someone with this terrible but massively rare motivation, or perhaps even just a country like North Korea who wants to have a kind of blackmail policy to make sure that no one ever invades. That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m worried about that. These rapid advances are empowering us to make really terrible weapons.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> All right, so wrapping things up here. How do we then safeguard the potential for humanity and Earth-originating intelligent life? You seem to give some advice on high level strategy, policy and individual level advice, and this is all contextualized within this grand plan for humanity, which is that we reach existential security by getting to a place where existential risk is decreasing every century that we then enter a period of long reflection to contemplate and debate what is good and how we might explore the universe and optimize it to express that good and then that we execute that and achieve our potential. So again, how do we achieve all this, how do we mitigate x-risk, how do we safeguard the potential of humanity?</p><p><strong>Toby Ord:</strong> That&#x2019;s an easy question to end on. So what I tried to do in the book is to try to treat this at a whole lot of different levels. You kind of refer to the most abstract level to some extent, the point of that abstract level is to show that we don&#x2019;t need to get ultimate success right now, we don&#x2019;t need to solve everything, we don&#x2019;t need to find out what the fundamental nature of goodness is, and what worlds would be the best. We just need to make sure we don&#x2019;t end up in the ones which are clearly among the worst.</p><p>The point of looking further onwards with the strategy is just to see that we can set some things aside for later. Our task now is to reach what I call existential security and that involves this idea that will be familiar to many people to do with existential risk, which is to look at particular risks and to work out how to manage them, and to avoid falling victim to them, perhaps by being more careful with technology development, perhaps by creating our protective technologies. For example, better bio surveillance systems to understand if bio weapons have been launched into the environment, so that we could contain them much more quickly or to develop say a better work on alignment with AI research.</p><p>But it also involves not just fighting fires, but trying to become the kind of society where we don&#x2019;t keep lighting these fires. I don&#x2019;t mean that we don&#x2019;t develop the technologies, but that we build in the responsibility for making sure that they do not develop into existential risks as part of the cost of doing business. We want to get the fruits of all of these technologies, both for the long-term and also for the short-term, but we need to be aware that there&#x2019;s this shadow cost when we develop new things, and we blaze forward with technology. There&#x2019;s shadow cost in terms of risk, and that&#x2019;s not normally priced in. We just kind of ignore that, but eventually it will come due. If we keep developing things that produce these risks, eventually, it&#x2019;s going to get us.</p><p>So what we need to do to develop our wisdom, both in terms of changing our common sense conception of morality, to take this long-term future seriously or our debts to our ancestors seriously, and we also need the international institutions to help avoid some of these tragedies of the commons and so forth as well, to find these cases where we&#x2019;d all be prepared to pay the cost to get the security if everyone else was doing it, but we&#x2019;re not prepared to just do it unilaterally. We need to try to work out mechanisms where we can all go into it together.</p><p>There are questions there in terms of policy. We need more policy-minded people within the science and technology space. People with an eye to the governance of their own technologies. This can be done within professional societies, but also we need more technology-minded people in the policy space. We often are bemoan the fact that a lot of people in government don&#x2019;t really know much about how the internet works or how various technologies work, but part of the problem is that the people who do know about how these things work, don&#x2019;t go into government. It&#x2019;s not just that you can blame the people in government for not knowing about your field. People who know about this field, maybe some of them should actually work in policy.</p><p>So I think we need to build that bridge from both sides and I suggest a lot of particular policy things that we could do. A good example in terms of how concrete and simple it can get is that we renew the New START Disarmament Treaty. This is due to expire next year. And as far as I understand, the U.S. government and Russia don&#x2019;t have plans to actually renew this treaty, which is crazy, because it&#x2019;s one of the things that&#x2019;s most responsible for the nuclear disarmament. So, making sure that we sign that treaty again, it is a very actionable point that people can kind of motivate around and so on.</p><p>And I think that there&#x2019;s stuff for everyone to do. We may think that existential risk is too abstract and can&#x2019;t really motivate people in the way that some other causes can, but I think that would be a mistake. I&#x2019;m trying to sketch a vision of it in this book that I think can have a larger movement coalesce around it and I think that if we look back a bit when it came to nuclear war, the largest protest in America&#x2019;s history at that time was against nuclear weapons in Central Park in New York and it was on the grounds that this could be the end of humanity. And that the largest movement at the moment, in terms of standing up for a cause is on climate change and it&#x2019;s motivated by exactly these ideas about irrevocable destruction of our heritage. It really can motivate people if it&#x2019;s expressed the right way. And so that actually fills me with hope that things can change.</p><p>And similarly, when I think about ethics, and I think about how in the 1950s, there was almost no consideration of the environment within their conception of ethics. It just was considered totally outside of the domain of ethics or morality and not really considered much at all. And the same with animal welfare, it was scarcely considered to be an ethical question at all. And now, these are both key things that people are taught in their moral education in school. And we have an entire ministry for the environment and that was within 10 years of Silent Spring coming out, I think all, but one English speaking country had a cabinet level position on the environment.</p><p>So, I think that we really can have big changes in our ethical perspective, but we need to start an expansive conversation about this and start unifying these things together not to be just like the anti-nuclear movement and the anti-climate change movement where it&#x2019;s fighting a particular fire, but to be aware that if we want to actually get out there preemptively for these things that we need to expand that to this general conception of existential risk and safeguarding humanity&#x2019;s long-term potential, but I&#x2019;m optimistic that we can do that.</p><p>That&#x2019;s why I think my best guess is that there&#x2019;s a one in six chance that we don&#x2019;t make it through this Century, but the other way around, I&#x2019;m saying there&#x2019;s a five in six chance that I think we do make it through. If we really played our cards right, we could make it a 99% chance that we make it through this Century. We&#x2019;re not hostages to fortune. We humans get to decide what the future of humanity will be like. There&#x2019;s not much risk from external forces that we can&#x2019;t deal with such as the asteroids. Most of the risk is of our own doing and we can&#x2019;t just sit here and bemoan the fact we&#x2019;re in some difficult prisoner&#x2019;s dilemma with ourselves. We need to get out and solve these things and I think we can.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> Yeah. This point on moving from these particular motivation and excitement around climate change and nuclear weapons issues to a broader civilizational concern with existential risk seems to be a crucial and key important step in developing the kind of wisdom that we talked about earlier. So yeah, thank you so much for coming on and thanks for your contribution to the field of existential risk with this book. It&#x2019;s really wonderful and I recommend listeners read it. If listeners are interested in that, where&#x2019;s the best place to pick it up? How can they follow you?</p><p><strong>Toby Ord:</strong> You could check out my website at tobyord.com. You could follow me on Twitter @tobyordoxford or I think the best thing is probably to find out more about the book at theprecipice.com. On that website, we also have links as to where you can buy it in your country, including at independent bookstores and so forth.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> All right, wonderful. Thanks again, for coming on and also for writing this book. I think that it&#x2019;s really important for helping to shape the conversation in the world and understanding around this issue and I hope we can keep nailing down the right arguments and helping to motivate people to care about these things. So yeah, thanks again for coming on.</p><p><strong>Toby Ord:</strong> Well, thank you. It&#x2019;s been great to be here.</p>",Palus Astra,palus-astra,Palus Astra,
A5jN7vqAxsHCDC4dy,Meta-preferences two ways: generator vs. patch,meta-preferences-two-ways-generator-vs-patch,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/A5jN7vqAxsHCDC4dy/meta-preferences-two-ways-generator-vs-patch,2020-04-01T00:51:49.086Z,18,6,0,False,False,,"<p>In my last post (<a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/8NpwfjFuEPMjTdriJ/gricean-communication-and-ai"">Gricean communication and meta-preferences</a>), I talked about the infinite tower of meta-preferences that in principle could be applied by humans.  Example meta-preference: &quot;I&apos;d rather that I didn&apos;t act like I want to watch a bunch of random youtube videos - that&apos;s not a &apos;real&apos; preference, it&apos;s something I should change.&quot; And then you can have meta-meta-feelings about this meta-preference, and off you go.</p><p>This infinite tower can&apos;t fit into reality, so it has to be dealt with somehow if we want to include the effects of meta-preferences in the process of value learning. Now, it&apos;s possible to deny this premise, model humans as actually only being able to compute a finite number of levels, and imitate that finite number of levels perfectly. But if we want to avoid the <em>reductio</em> that value learning should aim for perfect human imitation, I think there are two different camps here.</p><p>The <em>generator</em> camp treats each level of meta-preferences as an important generator of the level below. The infinite regress is avoided by using the fact that all levels of the tower are computed by the same mind, so incorporating meta-ethics is about approximating a fixed point of this self-ratification process. Preferably finding a fixed point that makes judgements sort of like humans&apos; in easy cases. I think one can make a very good case for this, and that it&apos;s sort of hinted at in IDA approaches.</p><p>But my preferred approach is to treat the higher meta-levels as <em>patches</em> to the object level. That is, finding some approximation scheme where the meta-preferences are corrections that rapidly converge. Unlike the generator framework, different levels in the patch framework can be different parts of a heterogeneous values model, rather than being different questions posed to a single agent model. </p><p><strong>One way of thinking about patches</strong></p><p>In brainstorming for this post, I went through a bunch of patch ideas that <em>won&apos;t</em> work (happy to talk about those if prompted). But here&apos;s a way of thinking by making the analogy to semi-supervised learning (similar to the ideas used in &quot;<a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Bxxh9GbJ6WuW5Hmkj/what-s-the-dream-for-giving-natural-language-commands-to-ai"">What&apos;s the dream for giving natural language commands to AI?</a>&quot;) that might be productive:</p><p>To say it too-simply, imagine just asking the AI to include meta-preferences. If we &quot;ask&quot; (in quotes because we might be talking about prompting with some large amount of examples or other methods of definition) the AI for the representation of &quot;what humans want,&quot; we trigger a different representation than if we ask for &quot;what humans want, if we knew more, thought faster, were more the people we wished we were, had grown up farther together, etc.&quot;</p><p>We have to be a little careful about what kind of thing the AI is actually doing here. Activating features is fundamentally about pattern-matching. &quot;What humans want&quot; would just be some representative, useful feature that does a good job helping the AI predict the prompts. Where humans are inconsistent or vague, we might want the AI to average things out by representativeness or usefulness as a feature. This would mean that minor inconsistencies would have only minor contributions, but along the axes where there&apos;s strong conflict, the sum might cancel out.</p><p>Now, what would it do with &quot;what humans want, if we knew more, thought faster, were more the people we wished we were, etc.&quot;? <em>The exact same thing</em>! It would not simulate any actual self-improvement, instead it would find some feature that&apos;s representative of self-improvement - it would change its representation of human values in a &quot;self-improvementy&quot; sort of way.</p><p>You can simulate this exact same cognitive pattern by asking yourself &quot;what would someone do if they were a better person?&quot; You  didn&apos;t answer this question by simulating them, or even trying to mirror some process of self-reflection. Instead, you have some pre-computed ideas about what that sort of change looks like. These might be abstracted from actual observations of self-reflection, but they&apos;re also going to incorporate more abstract ideas that we might not have learned from experience.</p><p>There&apos;s a bunch of issues with this - it runs straight into the alien concepts problem, and we might want to more explicitly simulate the actual dynamics of self-reflection. But for now, I&apos;m finding it a useful way to think about &quot;meta-preferences as patch.&quot;</p>",Charlie Steiner,charlie-steiner,Charlie Steiner,

cTEoHcP8G47FyR6Qh,Throw a prediction party with your EA/rationality group,throw-a-prediction-party-with-your-ea-rationality-group,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/cTEoHcP8G47FyR6Qh/throw-a-prediction-party-with-your-ea-rationality-group,2016-12-31T23:02:11.284Z,14,9,14,False,False,,"<p>TL;DR: Prediction &amp; calibration parties are an exciting way for your EA/rationality/LessWrong group to practice rationality skills and celebrate the new year.<br /><br />On December 30th, Seattle Rationality had a prediction party. Around 15 people showed up, brought snacks, brewed coffee, and spent several hours making predictions for 2017, and generating confidence levels for those predictions.<br /><br />This was heavily inspired by Scott Alexander&rsquo;s yearly predictions. (<a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/01/01/2014-predictions-calibration-results/"">2014 results</a>, <a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/01/02/2015-predictions-calibration-results/"">2015 results</a>, <a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/01/25/predictions-for-2016/"">2016 predictions</a>.) Our move was to turn this into a communal activity, with a few alterations to meet our needs and make it work better in a group.<br /><strong><br />Procedure:<br /></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Each person individually writes a bunch of predictions for the upcoming year. They can be about global events, people&rsquo;s personal lives, etc. 
<ul>
<li>If you use Scott Alexander&rsquo;s system, create 5+ predictions each for fixed confidence levels (50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, etc.)</li>
<li>If you want to generate <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brier_score"">Brier scores</a> or <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoring_rule#Logarithmic_scoring_rule"">logarithmic scores</a>, just do 30+ predictions at whatever confidence levels you believe.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Write down confidence levels for each prediction.</li>
<li>Save your predictions and put it aside for 12 months.</li>
<li>Open up your predictions and see how everyone did.</li>
</ul>
<p>To make this work in a group, we recommend the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t share your confidence intervals</strong>. Avoid <a href=""/lw/j7/anchoring_and_adjustment/"">anchoring</a> by just not naming how likely or unlikely you think any prediction is.</li>
<li><strong>Do share predictions.</strong> Generating 30+ predictions is difficult, and sharing ideas (without confidence levels) makes it way easier to come up with a bunch. We made a shared google doc, and everyone pasted some of their predictions into it.</li>
<li>Make predictions that, in a year, will verifiably have happened or not. (IE, not &ldquo;the academic year will go well&rdquo;, which is debatable, but &ldquo;I will finish the year with a 3.5 GPA or above&rdquo;.)</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s convenient to assume that unless stated otherwise predictions that end by the next year (IE, ""I will go to the Bay Area"" means ""I will go to the Bay Area at least once in 2017."") It&rsquo;s also fine to make predictions that have other end dates (&ldquo;I will go to EA Global this summer.&rdquo;)</li>
<li>Make a bunch of predictions first without thinking too hard about how likely they are, <em>then</em> assign confidence levels. <a href=""/lw/n55/a_note_about_calibration_of_confidence/"">This post details why.</a> You could also generate a group list of predictions, and everyone individually lists their own confidence levels.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />This makes a good activity for rationality/EA groups for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Practicing rationality skills: 
<ul>
<li>Making accurate predictions</li>
<li>Using confidence intervals</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Accessibility 
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s open to many different knowledge levels. Even if you don&rsquo;t know a thing about geopolitics, you can still give predictions and confidence intervals about media, sports, or your own life.</li>
<li>More free-form and less intimidating than using a prediction market. You do not have to know about the details of forecasting to try this.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Natural time and recurring activity 
<ul>
<li>You could do this at any point during the year, but doing it at the start of the year seems appropriate for ringing in the new year.</li>
<li>In twelve months, you have an automatic new activity, which is coming back together and checking everybody&rsquo;s predictions from last year. Then you make a new set of predictions for next year. (If this falls through for some reason, everyone can, of course, still check their predictions on their own.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fostering a friendly sense of competitiveness 
<ul>
<li>Everyone wants to have the best calibration, or the lowest Brier score. Everyone wants to have the most accurate predictions!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><br />Some examples of the predictions people used:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any <a href=""https://www.gjopen.com/challenges"">open challenges from the Good Judgment Project</a>.</li>
<li>I will switch jobs.</li>
<li>I will make more than $1000 money in a way that is different from my primary job or stock.</li>
<li>I will exercise 3 or more times per week in October, November, December.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ll get another tattoo.</li>
<li>Gay marriage will continue to be legal in Washington state.</li>
<li>Gay marriage will continue to be legal in all 50 states.</li>
<li>I will try Focusing at least once.</li>
<li>I will go to another continent.</li>
<li>CRISPR clinical trials will happen on humans in the US.</li>
<li>A country that didn&rsquo;t previously have nuclear weapons will acquire them.</li>
<li>I will read Thinking Fast and Slow.</li>
<li>I will go on at least 3 dates.</li>

<li>Brier values and graphs of &lsquo;perfect&rsquo; vs. actual scores will give you different information. <a href=""/lw/436/looking_for_information_on_scoring_calibration/"">Yvain writes about the differences between these</a>. Several of us did predictions last year using the Scott Alexander method (bins at fixed probabilities), although this year, everybody seems to have used continuous probabilities. The exact method by which we&rsquo;ll determine how well-calibrated we were will be left to Seattle Rationality of 2018, but will probably include Brier values AND something to determine calibration.</li>

<div>
<div>In 2016, cryonics remains a fringe operation. When it is discussed in the news or on social media, many express surprise that cryonics is a ""real thing"" outside of science fiction. Many others who do know about cryonics tend to label it a pseudoscience. Brain preservation (BP) through non-conventional cryonics methods such as those using aldehyde fixation is even more fringe, with most people not aware of it, and others dismissing it because it uses ""toxic"" chemicals.&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
<div>Here's a rundown of some events important to cryonics/BP in 2016.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><strong>Research progress</strong></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>- The <a href=""http://www.brainpreservation.org/small-mammal-announcement/"">Brain Preservation Foundation prize</a> was won in February by Robert McIntyre and Greg Fahy. Their winning technique uses glutaraldehyde fixation followed by glycerol cryoprotection (in addition to a step to improve blood-brain barrier permeability and several other components) and allows for the preservation of neural structure as verified by electron microscopy across the cortex. McIntyre has since started a company called <a href=""https://www.nectome.com/"">Nectome</a> in part to improve and refine this procedure.</div>
<div>- Aschwin de Wolf of Advanced Neural Biosciences <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUhZ6-mtWVk&amp;t=2000s"">announced in November at the CryoSuisse conference</a> that Advanced Neural Biosciences has developed a method that reduces dehydration in rat brain vitrification by using ""brain optimized cryoprotectants."" There is no peer-reviewed data or more detailed procedure available as of yet, and viability of the tissue may be a concern.&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
<div><strong>Legal progress</strong></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>- In Canada, Keegan Macintosh and Carrie Wong <a href=""http://motherboard.vice.com/read/the-only-anti-cryonics-law-in-north-america-is-being-challenged-in-court"">are challenging the anti-cryonics laws in British Columbia</a>.&nbsp;</div>
<div>- <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2016/11/8/13520908/assisted-suicide-colorado-death-dignity-right-die-election-2016"">A right-to-die law passed in Colorado</a>. Although not directly relevant to cryonics, it increases the number of locations where it might be possible to start brain preservation procedures in a more controlled manner by taking advantage of physician-assisted suicide in a terminally ill patient. This has been described as ""cryothanasia"" and is controversial both within the cryonics community and outside of it.&nbsp;</div>
<div>- As far as I know, cryonics and brain preservation remain illegal in France, China, and many other areas.&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
<div><strong>Current Cryonics Organizations&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>- Alcor</div>
<div>- Cryonics Institute&nbsp;</div>
<div>- KrioRus. They are planning on moving to Tver, which is a few hours west of Moscow (<a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-decapitate-and-chill/"">see Bloomberg profile</a>).&nbsp;</div>
<div>- Oregon Cryonics. This year, they put a hold on <a href=""http://www.oregoncryo.com/memberPortal.html"">allowing users to sign up through their member portal</a>, with the organization pivoting towards research until they can focus on ""some critical cryonics research"" to validate their methods. <a href=""http://motherboard.vice.com/read/life-is-chill-when-you-believe-science-will-solve-death-cryonics"">OC was profiled by Vice in March</a>.&nbsp;</div>
<div>- TransTime. This small cryonics company in San Leandro is still active, and <a href=""http://fusion.net/story/281674/real-future-episode-9-cryonics/"">was profiled in a video in Fusion earlier this year</a>.&nbsp;</div>
<div>- Osiris. This is a new, for-profit company in Florida that has so far been controversial within the cryonics community, and was <a href=""http://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/floridas-first-body-freezing-cryonics-facility-says-it-will-open-in-miami-8864582"">recently profiled in the Miami New Times</a>. &nbsp;</div>
<div>- There are other organizations that only do standby and/or cryoprotectant perfusion.&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
<div><strong>Essays about cryonics</strong></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>- Tim Urban's <a href=""http://waitbutwhy.com/2016/03/cryonics.html"">post at Wait But Why</a> about cryonics has wonderful diagrams explaining concepts such as why many people consider death to be a process, not an event. Like most everything Urban writes, it went viral and is still being posted on social media. &nbsp;</div>
<div>- Corey Pein's <a href=""http://thebaffler.com/salvos/everybody-freeze-pein"">article at The Baffler</a> focuses primarily on critiques of Alcor and in particular Max More.&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>- In April, <a href=""http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20160424-if-cryonics-suddenly-worked-wed-need-to-face-the-fallout"">an essay by Rachel Nuwer</a> at BBC considered what would happen if cryonics worked.&nbsp;</div>
<div>- Neuroscientist Clive Coen critiqued cryonics in <a href=""https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5116/to-store-perchance-to-thaw"">an essay at New Humanist</a> in November.&nbsp;</div>
<div>- In January, <a href=""http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2016/01/29/how-can-you-protect-a-brain-by-destroying-it/"">PZ Myers critiqued aldehyde stabilized cryopreservation</a> as ""wishful thinking"" because it is not yet possible to upload the memories/behaviors of even a simple organism based on information extracted post-fixation.&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
<div><strong>Cryonics in the news</strong></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>- In April, <a href=""http://www.cnbc.com/2016/04/26/meet-the-company-offering-a-chance-at-immortality-for-200000.html"">a profile of Elaine Walker</a>, who is signed up with Alcor, on CNBC led to a moderately large amount of press for cryonics.&nbsp;</div>
<div>- In August, <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/inside-steve-aokis-quest-for-edm-immortality-w435894"">a profile of Steve Aoki in Rolling Stone</a>, who is also signed up with Alcor, mentions his plan to do cryonics.&nbsp;</div>
<div>- In November, by far the biggest news story of the year about cryonics (dominating almost all of the Google trends variance) was about a <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/nov/18/teenage-girls-wish-for-preservation-after-death-agreed-to-by-court"">14-year-old girl who wanted cryonics and who had to go to court to prevent her father from stopping it</a>. The court allowed her to be cryopreserved following her legal death. This case and related issues were covered extensively in the Guardian and other British news outlets, sparking debate about cryonics generally in the UK.&nbsp;</div>

I'm going to try to explain the connection between one such new development and an important underlying claim. In particular, I'm going to explain the connection between donor lotteries (as recently <a href=""http://effective-altruism.com/ea/14d/donor_lotteries_a_stepbystep_guide_for_mall/"">implemented</a> by Carl Shulman in cooperation with Paul Christiano)<sup>1</sup> and returns to scale. (This year I&rsquo;m making a $100 contribution to this donor lottery, largely for symbolic purposes to support the concept.)</p>
<p>I'm not sure I'm adding much to Carl's original <a href=""http://reflectivedisequilibrium.blogspot.com/2014/01/if-big-donors-have-much-better.html"">post</a> on making bets to take advantage of returns to scale with this explainer. Please let me know whether you think this added anything or not.</p>
<h1>What is a donor lottery?</h1>
<p>Imagine ten people each have $1,000 to give to charity this year. They pool their money, and draw one of their names out of a hat. The winner gets to decide how to give away all $10,000. This is an example of a donor lottery.</p>
<p>More generally, a donor lottery is an arrangement where a group of people pool their money and pick one person to give it away. This selection is randomized so that each person has a probability of being selected proportional to their initial contribution.</p>
<h1>Selfish reasons to gamble</h1>
<p>Let's start with the case of a non-charitable expenditure. Usually, for consumption decisions, we have what economists call diminishing marginal utility. This is because we have limited ability to consume things, and also because we make the best purchases first.</p>
<p>Food is an example of something we have limited appetite for. After a certain point, we just aren't hungry anymore. But we also but the more important things first. Your first couple dollars a day make the difference between going hungry and having enough food. Your next couple dollars a day go to buying convenience or substituting higher-quality-foods, which is a material improvement, but nowhere near as big as the difference between starving and fed.</p>
<p>To take a case that's less universal, but maybe easier to understand the principle in, let's say I'm outfitting a kitchen, and own no knives. I can buy one of two knives &ndash; a small knife or a large one. The large knife can do a good job cutting large things, and a bad job cutting small things. The small knife can do a good job cutting small things, and a bad job cutting large things. If I buy one of these knives, I get the benefit of being able to cut things at all for both large and small items, plus the benefit of being able to cut things <em>well</em> in one category. If I buy the second knife, I only improve the situation by the difference between being able to cut things poorly in one category, and being able to cut them well. This is a smaller difference. I'd rather have one knife with certainty, than a 50% chance of getting both.</p>
<p>But sometimes, returns to consumption are increasing. Let's say that I have a spare thousand dollars after meeting all my needs, and there's only one more thing in the world I want that money can buy &ndash; a brand-new $100,000 sports car, unique enough that there are no reasonable substitutes. The $1,000 does me no good at all, $99,000 would do me no good at all, but as soon as I have $100,000, I can buy that car.</p>
<p>One thing I might want to do in this situation is gamble. If I can go to a casino and make a bet that has a 1% chance of multiplying my money a hundredfold (ignoring the house's cut for simplicity), then this is a good deal. Here's why. In the situation where I don't make the bet, I have a 100% chance of getting no value from the money. In the situation where I do make the bet, I have a 99% chance of losing the money, which I don't mind since I had no use for it anyway, but a 1% chance of being able to afford that sports car.</p>
<p>But since in practice the house does take a cut at casinos, and winnings are taxed, I might get a better deal by pooling my money together with 100 other like-minded people, and selecting one person at random to get the car. This way, 99% of us are no worse off, and one person gets a car.</p>
<p>The sports car scenario may seem far-fetched, especially once you take into account the prospect of saving up for things, or unexpected expenses. But it's not too far from the principle behind the <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/22/nyregion/new-yorkers-co-newcomers-savings-and-loan.html"">susu</a>, or ROSCA:</p>
<blockquote>Susus are generally made up of groups of family members or friends, each of whom pledges to put a certain amount of money into a central pot each week. That pot, presided over by a treasurer, whose honesty is vouched for by his or her respected standing among the participants, is then given to one member of the group.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Over the course of a susu's life, each member will receive a payout exactly equal to the total he has put in, which could range from a handful of dollar bills to several thousand dollars; members earn no interest on the money they set aside. After a complete cycle, the members either regroup and start over or go their separate ways.</blockquote>
<p>In communities where people either don't have access to savings or don't have the self-control to avoid spending down their savings on short-run emergencies, the susu is the opposite of consumption smoothing - it enables participants to bunch their spending together to make important long-run investments.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>A susu bears a strong resemblance to a partially randomized version of a donor lottery, for private gain.</p>
<h1>Gambling for the greater good</h1>
<p>Similarly, if you&rsquo;re trying to do the most good with your money, you might want to take into account returns to scale. As in the case of consumption, the ""normal"" case is diminishing returns to scale, because you're going to want to fund the best things you know of first. But you might think that the returns to scale are increasing in one of two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Diminishing marginal costs</li>
<li>Increasing marginal returns</li>
</ul>
<h3>Diminishing marginal costs</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say that your charity budget for this year is $5,000, and your best guess is that it will take about five hours of research to make a satisfactory giving decision. You expect that you&rsquo;ll be giving to charities for which $5,000 is a small amount, so that they have roughly constant returns to scale with respect to your donation. (This matters because what we care about are <a href=""http://benjaminrosshoffman.com/costs-are-not-benefits/"">benefits, not costs</a>.) In particular, for the sake of simplicity, let&rsquo;s say that you think that the best charity you&rsquo;re likely to find can add a healthy year to someone&rsquo;s life for $250, so your donation can buy 20 life-years.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, suppose that someone you trust offers you a bet with a 90% probability of getting nothing, and a 10% probability of getting back ten times what you put in. In this case, if you make a $5,000 bet, your expected giving is 10% * 10 * $5,000 = $5,000, the same as before. And if you expect the same impact per dollar up to $50,000, then if you win, your donation saves $50,000 / $250 = 200 life-years for beneficiaries of this charity. Since you only have a 10% chance of winning, your expected impact is 20 life-years, same as before.</p>
<p>But you only need to spend time evaluating charities if you win, so your expected time expenditure is 10% * 5 = 0.5 hours. This is strictly better &ndash; you have the same expected impact, for a tenth the expected research time.</p>
<p>These numbers are made up and in practice you don&rsquo;t know what the impact of your time will be, but the point is that if you&rsquo;re constrained by time to evaluate donations, you can get a better deal through lotteries.</p>
<h3>Increasing marginal benefits</h3>
<h4>The smooth case</h4>
<p>Of course, if you&rsquo;re giving away $50,000, you might be motivated to spend more than five hours on this. Let&rsquo;s say that you think that you can find a charity that&rsquo;s 10% more effective if you spend ten hours on it. Then in the winning scenario, you&rsquo;re spending an extra five hours to save an extra 20 lives, not a bad deal. Your expected lives saved is then 22, higher than in the original case, and your expected time allocation is 1 hour, still much less than before.</p>
<h4>The lumpy case</h4>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say that you know someone considering launching a new program, which you believe would be a better value per dollar than anything else you can find in a reasonable amount of time. But they can only run the program if they get a substantial amount of initial funds; for half as much, they can&rsquo;t do anything. They&rsquo;ve tried a &ldquo;kickstarter&rdquo; style pledge drive, but there aren&rsquo;t enough other donors interested. You have a good reason to believe that this isn&rsquo;t because you&rsquo;re mistaken about the program.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d fund the whole thing yourself, but you only have 10% of the needed funds on hand. Once again, you&rsquo;d want to play the odds.</p>
<h3>Lotteries, double-counting, and shared values</h3>
<p>One objection I&rsquo;ve seen potential participants raise against donor lotteries is that they&rsquo;d feel obliged to take into account the values of other participants if they won. This objection is probably related to the prevalence of double-counting schemes to motivate people to give.</p>
<p>I previously <a href=""http://benjaminrosshoffman.com/matching-donation-fundraisers-can-be-harmfully-dishonest/"">wrote</a> about ways in which ""matching donation"" drives only seem like they double your impact because of double-counting:</p>
<blockquote>But the main problem with matching donation fundraisers is that even when they aren't lying about the matching donor's counterfactual behavior, they misrepresent the situation by overassigning credit for funds raised.</blockquote>
<blockquote>I'll illustrate this with a toy example. Let's say that a charity - call it Good Works - has two potential donors, Alice and Bob, who each have $1 to give, and don't know each other. Alice decides to double her impact by pledging to match the next $1 of donations. If this works, and someone gives because of her match offer, then she'll have caused $2 to go to Good Works. Bob sees the match offer and reasons similarly: if he gives $1, this causes another $1 to go to Good Works, so his impact is doubled - he'll have caused Good Works to receive $2.</blockquote>
<blockquote>But if Alice and Bob each assess their impact as $2 of donations, then the total assessed impact is $4 - even though Good Works only receives $2. This is what I mean when I say that credit is overassigned - if you add up the amount of funding each donor is supposed to have caused, you get number that exceeds the total amount of funds raised.</blockquote>
<p>If you tried to justify donor lotteries this way, it would look like this: Let's say you and nine other people each put in $10,000. You have a 10% chance of getting to give away $100,000. But if you lose, the other nine people still want to give to something that fulfills your values at least somewhat. So you are giving away more than $10,000 in expectation. This is double-counting because if you apply it consistently to each member of the group in turn, it assigns credit for more funding than the entire group is responsible for. It only works if you think you're getting one over on the other people if you win.</p>
<p>For instance, maybe you'd really spend your winnings on a sports car, but giving the money to an effective charity seems better than nothing, so they're fulfilling your values, but you're not fulfilling theirs.</p>
<p>Naturally, some people feel bad about getting one over on people, and consequently feel some obligation to take their values into account.</p>
<p>There are some circumstances under which this could be reasonable. People could be pooling their donations even though they're risk-averse about charities, simply in order to economize on research time. But in the central case of donor lotteries, everyone likes the deal they're getting, even if the estimate the value of other donors' planned use of the money at zero.</p>
<p>The right way to evaluate the expected value of a donor lottery is to only take the deal if you'd take the same deal from a casino or financial instrument where you didn't think you were value-aligned with your counterparty. Assume, if you will, that everyone else just wants a sports car. If you do this, you won't double-count your impact by pretending that you win even if you lose.</p>
<h1>Claim: returns to scale for individual donations</h1>
<p>Donor lotteries were originally proposed as a response to an argument based on returns to scale:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some effective altruists used &ldquo;lumpy&rdquo; returns to scale (for instance, where extra money matters only when it tips the balance over to hiring an additional person) to justify favoring charities that turn funds into impact more smoothly.</li>
<li>Some effective altruists say that small donors should defer to GiveWell&rsquo;s recommendations because for the time it makes to spend on allocating a small donation, they shouldn&rsquo;t expect to do better than GiveWell.</li>

<p>In his original <a href=""http://reflectivedisequilibrium.blogspot.com/2014/01/if-big-donors-have-much-better.html"">post&nbsp;</a>on making use of randomization to increase scale, Carl Shulman summarizes the case against these arguments:</p>
<blockquote>In a recent&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.effective-altruism.com/where-im-giving-and-why-will-macaskill/"">blog post</a>&nbsp;Will MacAskill described a donation opportunity that he thought was attractive, but less so for him personally because his donation was smaller than a critical threshold:
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">This expenditure is also pretty lumpy, and I don&rsquo;t expect them to get all their donations from small individual donations, so it seems to me that donating 1/50th of the cost of a program manager isn&rsquo;t as good as 1/50th of the value of a program manager.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>When this is true, it can be better to exchange a donation for a 1/50 chance of a donation 50 times as large. One might also think that when donating $1,000,000 rather than $1 one can afford to spend more time and effort in evaluating opportunities, get more access to charities, and otherwise enjoy some of the advantages possessed by large foundations.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Insofar as one believes that there are such advantages, it doesn't make sense to be defeatist about obtaining them. In some ways resources like GiveWell and Giving What We Can are designed to let the effective altruist community mimic a large effectiveness-oriented foundation. One can give to the&nbsp;<a href=""http://blog.givewell.org/2009/06/09/donating-to-gates-against-its-will/"">Gates Foundation</a>, or&nbsp;<a href=""http://reflectivedisequilibrium.blogspot.com/2013/12/donor-advised-fund-using-future.html"">substitute for Good Ventures</a>&nbsp;to keep its cash reserves high.</blockquote>
<blockquote>However, it is also possible to take advantage of economies of scale by purchasing a lottery (in one form or another), a small chance of a large donation payoff. In the event the large donation case arises, then great efforts can be made to use it wisely and to exploit the economies of scale.</blockquote>
<p>There's more than one reason you might choose to trust the recommendations of GiveWell or Giving What We Can, or directly give to either, or to the Gates Foundation. One consideration is that there are returns to scale for delegating your decisions to larger organizations. Insofar as this is why donors give based on GiveWell recommendations, GiveWell is serving as a sort of nonrandomized donor lottery in which the GiveWell founders declared themselves the winners in advance. The benefit of this structure is that it's available. The obvious disadvantage is that it's hard to verify shared values.</p>
<p>Of course, there are other good reasons why you might give based on GiveWell's recommendation. For instance, you might especially trust their judgment based on their track record. The proposal of donor lotteries is interesting because it separates out the returns to scale consideration, so it can be dealt with on its own, instead of being conflated with other things.</p>
<p>Even if your current best guess is that you should trust the recommendations of a larger donor, if you are uncertain about this, and expect that spending time thinking it through would help make your decision better, then a donor lottery allows you to allocate that research time more efficiently, and make better delegation decisions. There's nothing stopping you from giving to a larger organization if you win, and decide that's the best thing. So, the implications of a position on returns to scale are:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you think that there are increasing returns to scale for the amount of money you have to allocate, then you should be interested in giving money to larger donors who share your values, or giving based on their recommendations. But you should be even more interested in participating in a donor lottery.</li>
<li>If you think that there are diminishing returns to scale for the amount of money you have to move, then you should not be interested in giving money to larger donors, participating in a donor lottery, accepting money from smaller donors, or making recommendations for smaller donors to follow.</li>
</ul>
<p>With those implications in mind, here are some claims it might be good to argue about:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""https://arbital.com/p/75w/"">A typical donor with a $5,000 charity budget, on the margin, has increasing returns to scale.</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://arbital.com/p/75x/"">Good Ventures has increasing returns to scale.</a></li>
</ul>

<p><sup>1 </sup>This phrasing was suggested by Paul. Here's how Carl describes their roles: ""I came up with the idea and basic method, then asked Paul if he would provide a donor lottery facility. He did so, and has been taking in entrants and solving logistical issues as they come up.""</p>

<p>When I was trying to find where I'd originally heard about these and didn't remember what they were called, I Googled for poor people in developing countries using lotteries as savings, but most relevant-looking results were about using lotteries to trick poor people into saving. Almost none were about what poor people were already doing to solve their actually existing problems. It turns out, sometimes the poor can do financial engineering when they need to. The global poor aren't necessarily poor because they're stupid or helpless. Seems pretty plausible that in many cases, they're poor because they haven't got enough money.</p>",Benquo,benquo,Benquo,

<p>In particular, in the ""Hard values, easy values"" section of this post, Paul writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My statement of the control problem is only really meaningful because there are instrumental subgoals that are shared (or are extremely similar) between many different values, which let us compare the efficacy with which agents pursue those different values. Performance on these very similar subgoals should be used as the performance metric when interpreting my definition of AI control problem.</p>
<p>In fact even if we only resolved the problem for the similar-subgoals case, it would be pretty good news for AI safety. Catastrophic scenarios are mostly caused by our AI systems failing to effectively pursue convergent instrumental subgoals on our behalf, and these subgoals are by definition shared by a broad range of values.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Convergent instrumental subgoals are mostly about gaining power.  For example, gaining money is a convergent instrumental subgoal.  If some individual (human or AI) has convergent instrumental subgoals pursued well on their behalf, they will gain power.  If the most effective convergent instrumental subgoal pursuit is directed towards giving humans more power (rather than giving alien AI values more power), then humans will remain in control of a high percentage of power in the world.</p>
<p>If the world is not severely damaged in a way that prevents <em>any</em> agent (human or AI) from eventually colonizing space (e.g. severe nuclear winter), then the percentage of the <a href=""http://www.nickbostrom.com/astronomical/waste.html"">cosmic endowment</a> that humans have access to will be roughly close to to the percentage of power that humans have control of at the time of space colonization.  So the most relevant factors for the composition of the universe are (a) whether anyone at all can take advantage of the cosmic endowment, and (b) the long-term balance of power between different agents (humans and AIs).</p>
<p>I expect that ensuring that the long-term balance of power favors humans constitutes most of the AI alignment problem, and that other parts of the AI alignment problem (e.g.  ensuring AIs are beneficial in the short term, ensuring that AI systems don't cause global catastrophic risks that cause the cosmic endowment to become unavailable to any agent) will be easier to solve after thinking about this part of the problem.  So I'm going to focus on power acquisition for now.</p>
<h2>Priors and multidimensional power</h2>
<p>Convergent instrumental subgoals aren't <em>totally</em> convergent, since power is multidimensional, and some types of power are more useful for some values.</p>
<p>Suppose the sun is either going to turn green or blue in 10 years.  No one knows which color it will turn; people disagree, and it seems like their beliefs about the sun are irreconcilable because they result from different priors.  The people who predict the sun will turn green (or equivalently, care more about futures in which the sun is green) buy more green-absorbing solar panels, while those who predict the sun will turn blue will buy more blue-absorbing solar panels.  How could we measure how much power different people have?</p>
<p>In situations like this, it seems wrong to reduce power to a single scalar; there are at least 2 scalars involved in this situation (how much power someone has in futures where the sun turns green, versus in futures where the sun turns blue).</p>
<p>For the AI to gain power on the user's behalf, it should gain <em>the kind of power the user cares about</em>.  If the user thinks the sun will turn green, then the AI should buy green-absorbing solar panels.</p>
<p>What if the user hasn't made up their mind about which color the sun will be, or it's hard for the AI to elicit the user's beliefs for some other reason?  Then the AI could pursue a conservative strategy, in which the user does not lose power in either possible world.  In the case of solar panels, if 60% of the solar panels that everyone buys absorb green, then the AI should invest 60% of the user's solar panel budget in green-absorbing solar panels and 40% in blue-absorbing solar panels.  This way, the user generates the same percentage of the energy in each possible world, and thus has the same amount of relative power.  This is suboptimal compared to if the user had more defined beliefs about the sun, but the user isn't any worse off than they were before, so this seems fine.</p>
<p>I think this is an important observation!  It means that it isn't always necessary for an AI system to have good priors about hard-to-verify facts (such as the eventual color of the sun), as long as it's possible to estimate the effective priors of the agents who the user wants to be competitive with.  In particular, if there is some ""benchmark"" unaligned AI system, and it is possible to determine that AI system's effective prior over facts like the color of the sun, then it should be possible to build an aligned AI system to use a similar prior and thereby be competitive with the unaligned AI system in all possible futures.</p>
<p>This doesn't only apply to priors, it also applies to things like discount rates (which are kind of like ""priors about which times matter"") and preferences about which parts of the universe are best to colonize (which are kind of like ""priors about which locations matter"").  In general, it seems like ""estimating what types of power a benchmark system will try acquiring and then designing an aligned AI system that acquires the same types of power for the user"" is a general strategy for making an aligned AI system that is competitive with a benchmark unaligned AI system.</p>

I make the case by first speaking about the problems of our current paradigm of evidence-based medicine.</p><h2>The status quo of evidence-based medicine</h2><p>While biology moves forward and the cost of genetic-sequencing dropped a lot faster than Moore's law the opposite is true for the development of new drugs. In the current status quo the development of new drugs rises exponentially with <a href=""http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2012/03/08/erooms_law"">Eroom's law</a>. While average lifespan increased greatly about the last century in Canada the average life span at age 90 increased only 1.9 years over the last century. In 2008 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that <a href=""http://articles.latimes.com/2010/dec/09/news/la-heb-stroke-20101209"">life expectancy in the US declined from 77.9 to 77.8 years</a>. After <a href=""http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.LE00.IN?locations=DE)"">Worldbank data</a> Germany increased average lifespan by two years over the last decade which is not enough for the dream of radical lifespan increases in our lifetime.</p><p>When it costs 80 million to test whether an intervention works and most attempts show that the intervention doesn't work we have a problem. We end up paying billions for every new intervention.</p><p>Eric Ries wrote ""The Lean Startup"". In it he argues that it's the job of a startup to produce validated learning. He proposes that companies that work with small batch sizes can produce more innovation because they can learn faster how to build good products. The existing process in medicine doesn't allow for small batch innovation because the measuring stick for whether an intervention works is too expensive.</p><p>In addition the evidence-based approach rests on the assumption that we don't build bespoke interventions for every client. As long as a treatment doesn’t generalize about multiple different patients, it’s not possible to test it with a trial. In principle a double-blind trial can't give you evidence that a bespoke intervention that targets the specific DNA profile of a patient and his co-morbidity works.</p><h2>The ideal of prediction-based medicine</h2><p>The evidence-based approach also assumes that practitioners are exchangeable. It doesn't model the fact that different physical therapist or psychologists have different skill levels. It doesn't provide a mechanism to reward highly skilled practitioners but it treats every practitioner that uses the same treatment intervention the same way.</p><p>Its strong focus on asking whether a treatment beats a placebo in double-blind studies makes it hard to compare different treatments against each other. In the absence of an ability to predict the effect sizes of different drugs with the literature the treatment that wins on the market is often the treatment that's best promoted by a pharmaceutical company.</p><p>How could a different system work? What's the alternative to making treatment decisions based on big and expensive studies that provide evidence?</p><p>I propose that a treatment provider should provide a patient with the credence that the treatment provider estimates for treatment outcomes that are of interest to the client.</p><p>If Bob wants to stop smoking and asks doctor Alice whether the treatment Alice provides will result in Bob not smoking in a year, Alice should provide him with her credence estimation. In addition Alice’s credence estimations can be entered in a central database. This allows Bob to see Alice’s Brier score that reflects the ability of Alice to predict the effects of her treatment recommendations.</p><p>In this framework Alice’s expertise isn't backed up by having gotten an academic degree and recommending interventions that are studied with expensive gold-standard studies. Her expertise is backed by her track record.</p><p>This means that Alice can charge money based on the quality of her skills. If Alice is extremely good she can make a lot of money with her intervention without having to pay billions for running trials.</p><p>Why don't we pay doctors in the present system based on their skills? We can't measure their skills in the present paradigm, because we can't easily compare the outcomes of different doctors. Hard patients get send to doctors with good reputations and as a result every doctor has an excuse for getting bad outcomes. In the status quo he can just assert that his patients were hard.</p><p>In prediction-based medicine a doctor can write down a higher credence for a positive treatment outcome for an easy patient than a hard patient. Patients can ask multiple doctors and are given good data to choose the treatment that provides the best outcome for which they are willing to pay.</p><p>In addition to giving the patient a more informed choice about the advantages of different treatment options this process helps the treatment provider to increase his skills. They learn about where they make errors in the estimation of treatment outcomes.</p><p>The provider can also innovate new treatments in small batches. Whenever he understands a treatment well enough to make predictions about its outcomes he's in business. He can easily iterate on his treatment and improve it.</p><h2>The way to bring prediction-based medicine into reality</h2><p>I don't propose to get rid of evidence-based medicine. It has its place and I don't have any problem with it for the cases where it works well.</p><p>It works quite poorly for body work interventions and psychological interventions that are highly skill based. I have seen hypnosis achieve great effects but at the same time there are also many hypnotists who don't achieve great effects. In the status quo a patient who seeks hypnosis treatment has no effective way to judge the quality of the treatment before he's buying.</p><p>A minimal viable product might be a website that's Uber for body workers and hypnotists. The website lists the treatment providers. The patient can enter his issue and every treatment provider can offer his credence of solving the issue of the patient and the price of his treatment.</p><p>Before getting shown the treatment providers, a prospective patient would take a standardized test to diagnose the illness. The information from the standardized test will allow the treatment providers make better predictions about the likelihood that they can cure the patient. Other standardized tests that aren’t disease specific like the OCEAN personality index can also be provided to the patient.</p><p>Following the ideas of David Burn’s <a href=""https://feelinggood.com/team-vs-cbt"">TEAM framework</a>, the treatment provider can also tell the patient to take tests between treatments sessions to keep better track of the progression of the patient.</p><p>When making the purchasing decision the patient agrees to a contract that includes him paying a fine, if he doesn’t report the treatment outcome after 3 months, 6 months and 1 year. This produces a comprehensive database of claims that allows us to measure how well the treatment providers are calibrated.&nbsp;<br>Various Quantified Self gadgets can be used to gather data.

<p>This January first, we will plan for the year ahead, but not in the style of new year's resolutions and imposing edicts on our future selves. Instead, we'll each individually step back, consider our priorities and possible long range plans, with a spirit of curiosity and the goal of realistically determining what will happen if we choose different strategies.</p></div>

It's what I think most people here focus on understanding: How to properly identify a complex system.</p>
<p>We all basically know that complex systems are unpredictable, in certain types of ways, due to incredible differences in outcomes present in small changes in starting parameters. Despite this, there seem to be some complex systems that still follow a certain state or pattern identifiable to a single input. In my field of study (economics) we know that if you increase the money supply inflation follows. Sort of. Lots of people though inflation would follow from quantitative easing following the Great Recession, when it didn't (in fact, if anything the opposite).</p>
<p>In the graph below you see that the market based expected inflation rate in 5 years shot up right as the economy began to tank, for fear of quantitative easing and low interest rates raising inflation (as they had in the past). In reality, so the retrospective story goes, the velocity of money dropped so heavily this countered any inflationary impacts. Then under a year later the market decided it would probably converge to its mean. This is how market based predictions went in arguably the most well understood part of macro-economics.</p>
<p>(I actually worked on a team at the Fed to try to help do this even better later on. Our team was the Financial Econ team, so we used market based measures instead of trying to build formal structural models. Could we predict inflation expectation dynamics better than a random walk? Yeah, but only just by the skin of our teeth. Plus, to paraphrase Tetlock, t's a field rewarded more by mastery of impressive tools than for accuracy)</p>

<p>As far as macro-economics goes, there are few things economists more reliably understand than the relationship between money and inflation. Within simple models (and probably in reality) it's clear that if you increase the monetary supply to infinity, the value is going to drop to zero. I can't prove it based on historical experiment, but it's reasonable to use fragments of past information and models to predict that if the government dropped trillions of dollars from helicopters over major U.S. cities, inflation would shoot up.</p>
<p>Despite this, there seem to be complex nonlinearities that mess with our predictions outside of extreme cases. I like this example because it seems to be a clear case of a complex system's state being determined monotonically by a single parameter in the extremes, yet still being non-predictable within most of our core areas of interest.</p>
<p>In the field of economics my intuition for when to doubt a prediction or model has been refined from years of studying and working in forecasting. It's nothing really taught in a textbook. The only way I try to rationally understand it is that there is a certain type of dynamics inherent in economic forecasting, across time, space, and problem type. Whether it's forecasting monetary policy, or revenue for T.V. sales in Spain, the way humans interact with economic systems follows some type of strange similar pattern. Over the years of working in this field I have an idea for this pattern, but I can't prove it or explain it.</p>
<p>It's similar to what Tetlock writes about in <em>Expert Political Judgement</em> and <em>Superforecasting</em>. Even in his analysis though (which is incredible) he is only able to identify a few general types of people. What I take from it is that there is something pretty heavy going on in the brain of a 'hedgehog' vs. a 'fog', which lets some people filter out a signal from reality more reliably. Still, based on his writing it seems more that hedgehog's fall into a cognitive bias of overconfidence, while Foxes are more humble to the complexity of reality, and more willing to stick to uninformative priors. My guess/prediction is what makes really great foxes is the ability to switch between knowing when you're dealing with a complex system, and when the answer really is obvious.</p>
<p>In <em>Expert Political Judgement</em> Tetlock writes ""One could be an excellent forecaster who relies on highly intuitive but logically indefensible guesswork."" What is in that guesswork though? There has got to be something going on there, which presents the fact that there are models of the world and systems of thinking that haven't been formalized, but which could let humans or computers properly classify when a system is too complex, and when there is a predictable state of the complex system.</p>
<p>Back to the original topic -- this drives me insane. We are able to personally develop heuristics for evaluating predictions and complex systems, but sharing them with others is really tough.</p>
<p>I'm interested in how others identify complex systems, specifically those related to your fields, and how do you try to communicate them to outsiders?</p>

Like most of my fellow citizens, I was not permitted to leave the country. But there was an important exception: People could leave after retirement. Why? Because that meant their forfeited their retirement benefits. Once you took more from the state than you gave, you were finally allowed to leave. West Germany would generously take you in. My family lived near the main exit checkpoint for a while and there was a long line of old people most days.</p>
<p>And then there is Saudi Arabia and other rentier states. Rentier states(https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rentier_state) derive most of their income not from their population. The population gets a lot more wealth from the state than the state gets from the population. States like Saudi Arabia are therefore relatively independent of their population's consent with policy. A citizen who is unhappy is welcome to leave, or to retreat to their private sphere and live off benefits while keeping their mouth shut - neither of these options incurs a significant cost for the state.</p>
<p>I think these facts are instructive in thinking about Universal Basic Income. I want to make a point that I haven't seen made in discussions of the matter.</p>
<p>Most political systems (not just democracies) are built on an assumption that the state needs its citizens. This assumption is always a bit wrong - for example, no state has much need of the terminally ill, except to signal to its citizens that it cares for all of them. In the cases of East Germany and Saudi Arabia, this assumption is more wrong. And Universal Basic Income makes it more wrong as well.</p>
<p>From the point of view of a state, there are citizens who are more valuable (or who help in competition with other states) and ones who are more of a burden (who make competing with other states more difficult). Universal Basic Income massively broadens the part of society that is a net loss to the state.</p>
<p>Now obviously technological unemployment is likely to do that anyway. But there's a difference between answers to that problem that divide up the available work between the members of society and answers that divide up society into contributors and noncontributors. My intuition is that UBI is the second kind of solution, because states will be incentivized to treat contributors differently from noncontributors. The examples are to illustrate that a state can behave very differently towards citizens if it is fundamentally not interested in retaining them.</p>
<p>I go along with Harari's suggestion that the biggest purely political problem of the 21st century is the integration of the economically unnecessary parts of the population into society. My worry is that UBI, while helping with immediate economic needs, makes that problem worse in the long run. Others have already pointed out problems with UBI (such as that in a democracy it'll be impossible to get rid of if it is a failure) that gradual approaches like lower retirement age, later entry into the workforce and less work per week don't have. But I reckon that behind the immediate problems with UBI such as the amount of funding it needs and the question of what it does to the motivation to work, there's a whole class of problems that arise out of the changed relationships between citizens, states and economies.

<p style=""color: #444444; font-family: Georgia, &quot;Bitstream Charter&quot;, serif; line-height: 1.5; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;"">I have been working on the assumption that&nbsp;<a style=""color: #743399; line-height: 1.5;"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit"">exploration-exploitation</a>&nbsp;knowledge was just common. &nbsp;Unfortunately I did the smart thing of&nbsp;learning about them from a mathematician at a dojo in Melbourne, which means that no. &nbsp;Not everyone knows about it. &nbsp;I discovered that again today when I searched for a good quick explanation of the puzzle. &nbsp;With that in mind this is about&nbsp;<strong style=""color: #000000; line-height: 1.5;"">Exploration Exploitation</strong>.</p>
<hr style=""color: #444444; font-family: Georgia, &quot;Bitstream Charter&quot;, serif; line-height: 1.5; cursor: default; background-color: #e7e7e7; border: 0px; clear: both; height: 1px; margin-bottom: 24px; font-size: 12px;"" />
<p style=""color: #444444; font-family: Georgia, &quot;Bitstream Charter&quot;, serif; line-height: 1.5; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;"">The classic Exploration-Exploitation problem in mathematics is the multi-armed bandit. &nbsp;Which is a slang term for a bank of slot machines. &nbsp;Where the player knows that each machine has a variable payoff and&nbsp;you have a limit number of attempts before you run out of money. &nbsp;You want to balance&nbsp;<em style=""line-height: 1.5; border: none;"">trying out new machines</em>&nbsp;with unknown payoffs against exploiting the&nbsp;<em style=""line-height: 1.5; border: none;"">knowledge you already have</em>&nbsp;from the earlier&nbsp;machines you tried.</p>
<p style=""color: #444444; font-family: Georgia, &quot;Bitstream Charter&quot;, serif; line-height: 1.5; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;"">When you first start on new bandits, you really don't know which will pay out and at what rates. &nbsp;So some exploration is necessary to know what your reward ratio in the&nbsp;<a style=""color: #743399; line-height: 1.5;"" href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Map_and_territory"">territory</a>&nbsp;will be. &nbsp;As your knowledge grows, you get to know which bandits are likely to pay, and which are not, and this later informs your choices as to where to place your dollars.</p>
<p style=""color: #444444; font-family: Georgia, &quot;Bitstream Charter&quot;, serif; line-height: 1.5; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;"">Mathematicians love a well specified problem like this because it allows us to make algorithm models of patterns that will return rewards or guarantee rewards given certain circumstances. &nbsp;(see also -&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a style=""color: #743399; line-height: 1.5;"" href=""http://bearlamp.com.au/the-application-of-the-secretary-problem-to-real-life-dating/"">secretary problem</a>&nbsp;which does similar. &nbsp;Where I showed how it applied to real life dating)</p>
<p style=""color: #444444; font-family: Georgia, &quot;Bitstream Charter&quot;, serif; line-height: 1.5; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;"">Some of the mathematical solutions to this problem look like:</p>
<p style=""color: #444444; font-family: Georgia, &quot;Bitstream Charter&quot;, serif; line-height: 1.5; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;""><strong style=""color: #000000; line-height: 1.5;"">Epsilon greedy</strong>&nbsp;-&nbsp;The best lever is selected for a proportion 1-&epsilon;&nbsp;of the trials, and a lever is selected at random (with uniform probability) for a proportion &epsilon;. A typical parameter value might be &epsilon;<span class=""mwe-math-mathml-inline mwe-math-mathml-a11y"" style=""line-height: 1.5;"">&nbsp;=0.1</span>&nbsp;but this can vary widely depending on circumstances.</p>
<p style=""color: #444444; font-family: Georgia, &quot;Bitstream Charter&quot;, serif; line-height: 1.5; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;""><strong style=""color: #000000; line-height: 1.5;"">Epsilon-decreasing strategy</strong>: Similar to the epsilon-greedy strategy, except that the value of &epsilon; decreases as the experiment progresses, resulting in highly exploratory&nbsp;behaviour at the start and highly exploitative behaviour at the finish.</p>
<p style=""color: #444444; font-family: Georgia, &quot;Bitstream Charter&quot;, serif; line-height: 1.5; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;"">Of course there are more strategies, and the context and nature of the problem matters. &nbsp;If&nbsp;the machines suddenly one day in the future all change, you might have a strategy that would prepare for potential scenarios like that. &nbsp;As you start shifting away from the hypothetical and towards real life your&nbsp;<a style=""color: #743399; line-height: 1.5;"" href=""http://bearlamp.com.au/adding-and-removing-complexity-from-models/"">models need to increase complexity</a>&nbsp;to cater to the details of the real world.</p>
<p style=""color: #444444; font-family: Georgia, &quot;Bitstream Charter&quot;, serif; line-height: 1.5; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;"">If this problem is&nbsp;more like real life (where we live and breathe), the possible variability of reality starts coming in to play more and more. &nbsp;In talking about this - I want to emphasise not the problem as interesting, but the solution of&nbsp;<strong style=""color: #000000; line-height: 1.5;"">&lt;sometimes explore&gt; and &lt;sometimes exploit&gt;</strong>&nbsp;in specific ratios or for specific reasons. &nbsp;The mathematical solutions the the multi-armed bandit problem&nbsp;are used in such a way to take advantage of the balance between&nbsp;<em style=""line-height: 1.5; border: none;"">not knowing enough</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em style=""line-height: 1.5; border: none;"">taking advantage of what you do know</em>.</p>
<p style=""color: #444444; font-family: Georgia, &quot;Bitstream Charter&quot;, serif; line-height: 1.5; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;"">What supercharges this solution and how it can be applied to real life is&nbsp;<a style=""color: #743399; line-height: 1.5;"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_of_information"">value of information</a>.</p>
<p style=""color: #444444; font-family: Georgia, &quot;Bitstream Charter&quot;, serif; line-height: 1.5; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;"">Value of Information says that in relation to making a decision, what informs that decision is&nbsp;<em style=""line-height: 1.5; border: none;"">worth something</em>. &nbsp;With expensive decisions, risky decisions, dangerous decisions, highly lucrative decisions, or particularly unknown decisions being more sure is important to think about.</p>
<p style=""color: #444444; font-family: Georgia, &quot;Bitstream Charter&quot;, serif; line-height: 1.5; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;"">VoI suggests that any decision that is worth money (or worth something) can have information that informs that decision. &nbsp;The value of information can add up to the value of the reward on correctly making the decision. &nbsp;Of course if you spend all the potential gains from the decision on getting the perfect information you lose the chance to make a profit. &nbsp;However usually a cheap (relative to the decision) piece of information exists that will inform the decision and assist.</p>
<p style=""color: #444444; font-family: Georgia, &quot;Bitstream Charter&quot;, serif; line-height: 1.5; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;"">How does this apply to exploration-exploitation?</p>

<p style=""color: #444444; font-family: Georgia, &quot;Bitstream Charter&quot;, serif; line-height: 1.5; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;"">The next thing to supercharge our exploration-exploitation and VoI knowledge is&nbsp;<a style=""color: #743399; line-height: 1.5;"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminishing_returns"">Diminishing returns</a>.</p>

<p>Bad news: &#8220;2016&#8221; is an arbitrary construct without causal agency. The decline of civilization is not the calendar&#8217;s fault, and it&#8217;s unlikely to get any better in 2017. Only one thing is guaranteed to get better in 2017 &#8211; this blog. Because <strong>you</strong> will make it better.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the post is a short, multiple choice, anonymous survey, designed to give me feedback on improving Putanumonit. I have very little information on what my readers like and dislike. When 1,000 people read my post and 5 of them leave comments, I have no clue what the other 995 thought of it. Please answer as many questions as you can <em>whether you&#8217;re a dedicated reader or just discovered Putanumonit for the first time.</em></p>
<p>If you <em>are</em> an enthusiastic reader and want to be involved in Putanumonit beyond just seeing the finalized posts, you can check out <em><a href=""https://putanumonit.com/cahoots/"" target=""_blank"">In Cahoots with Putanumonit</a></em> but please come back afterwards and fill out the survey. The more honest your responses are, the more you&#8217;ll like this blog in 2017.</p>

<h2 id=""summary"">Summary</h2>
<p>In 2016, Issa Rice and I conducted several surveys of Wikipedia usage. We collected survey responses from Slate Star Codex readers, Vipul&rsquo;s Facebook friends, and a few United States audiences through SurveyMonkey Audience and Google Surveys (known at the time as Google Consumer Surveys). Our survey questions measured how heavily people use Wikipedia, what sort of pages they read or expected to find, the relation between their search habits and Wikipedia, and other actions they took within Wikipedia.</p>
<p>The surveys are part of our work to understand the impact of contributing to Wikipedia. Both of us regularly contribute to the site, and we are also getting more people to work on editing and adding content to Wikipedia. Therefore we want to understand how people use Wikipedia, how much they use Wikipedia, what types of people tend to use Wikipedia, and so on, so that we can direct efforts more strategically.</p>
<p>Our three main takeaways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Wikipedia consumption is heavily skewed toward a profile of &ldquo;elite&rdquo; people, and these people use the site in qualitatively different ways. (<a href=""#takeaway-huge-gap-between-heavy-users-and-general-us-audience-plus-predictors-of-heavy-use"">More</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a result, we&rsquo;ve revised upward our estimate of the impact per pageview, and revised downward our estimate of the broad appeal and reach of Wikipedia. (<a href=""#takeaway-effect-on-impact-estimates-for-pageviews"">More</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The gap between elite samples of Wikipedia users and general United States Internet users is significantly greater than the gap between the different demographics within the United States that we measured.<br /> It is comparable to the gap between United States Internet users and Internet users in low-income countries. (<a href=""#takeaway-gap-with-elites-is-stronger-than-demographic-gaps-in-us-but-comparable-to-gap-between-us-and-low-income-countries"">More</a>)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This post goes over the survey questions, the responses of participants, and other survey data (specifically, data from the New Readers surveys by the Wikimedia Foundation) and then explains the takeaways.</p>

<h3 id=""first-surveymonkey-survey-s1"">First SurveyMonkey survey (S1)</h3>
<p>At the end of May 2016, <a href=""https://issarice.com"">Issa Rice</a> and I created a <a title=""Vipul Naik and Issa Rice. &quot;Research:Wikipedia usage survey&quot;. May 31, 2016. Wikimedia Meta Wiki."" href=""https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research:Wikipedia_usage_survey"">Wikipedia usage survey</a> on SurveyMonkey to gauge the usage habits of Wikipedia readers and editors.</p>
<h4 id=""audiences-for-s1"">Audiences for S1</h4>
<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SurveyMonkey"">SurveyMonkey</a> allows the use of different &ldquo;collectors&rdquo; (i.e.&nbsp;survey URLs that keep results separate), so we circulated several different URLs among four locations to see how different audiences would respond.</p>
<p>The audiences were as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>SurveyMonkey&rsquo;s United States audience with no demographic filters (62 responses, 54 of which are full responses). We will refer to this audience as SM, or S1SM if needed to avoid ambiguity.</p>
<p>Acquisition cost: $100 ($2 per response for 50 responses, 4 extra responses given gratis)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My Facebook timeline (<a title=""Vipul Naik. May 30, 2016. Archived at http://archive.is/M35mf."" href=""https://www.facebook.com/vipulnaik.r/posts/10208540131276697"">post asking people to take the survey</a>; 70 responses, 69 of which are full responses). For background on the timeline audience, see <a title=""Vipul Naik. &ldquo;Facebook&rdquo;."" href=""http://vipulnaik.com/facebook/"">my page on how I use Facebook</a>. We will refer to this audience as &ldquo;Vipul&rsquo;s Facebook friends&rdquo; or V for short.</p>
<p>Acquisition cost: None</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <a title=""Wikimedia. &ldquo;Analytics&rdquo;."" href=""https://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/analytics"">Wikipedia Analytics mailing list</a> (<a title=""Vipul Naik. &ldquo;Survey for Wikipedia readers&rdquo;.

Note that due to the small size of this group, the results below should not be trusted, unless possibly when the votes are decisive. We will refer to this audience as AM.</p>
<p>Acquisition cost: None</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Slate Star Codex (<a title=""Scott Alexander. &ldquo;Links 6/16: Linkandescence&rdquo;. June 2, 2016. Slate Star Codex."" href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/06/02/links-616-linkandescence/"">post that links to the survey</a>; 618 responses, 596 of which are full responses). We will refer to this audience as SSC.</p>
<p>While Slate Star Codex isn&rsquo;t the same as LessWrong, we think there is significant overlap in the two sites&rsquo; audiences (see e.g. <a title=""ingres. &ldquo;2016 LessWrong Diaspora Survey Analysis: Part Two (LessWrong Use, Successorship, Diaspora)&rdquo;. June 10, 2016. LessWrong."" href=""/lw/nor/2016_lesswrong_diaspora_survey_analysis_part_two/"">the recent LessWrong diaspora survey results</a>).</p>

<p>In addition, although not an actual audience with a separate URL, several of the tables we present below will include an &ldquo;H&rdquo; group; this is the heavy users group of people who responded by saying they read 26 or more articles per week on Wikipedia. This group has 179 people: 164 from Slate Star Codex, 11 from Vipul&rsquo;s timeline, and 4 from the Analytics mailing list.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We ran the survey from May 30 to July 9, 2016 (although only the Slate Star Codex survey had a response past June 1).</p>
<h4 id=""questions-for-s1"">Questions for S1</h4>
<p>For reference, here are the survey questions for the first survey. A dummy/mock-up version of the survey can be found here: <a class=""uri"" href=""https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/PDTTBM8"">https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/PDTTBM8</a>.</p>
<p>The survey introduction said the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This survey is intended to gauge Wikipedia use habits. This survey has 3 pages with 5 questions total (3 on the first page, 1 on the second page, 1 on the third page). Please try your best to answer all of the questions, and make a guess if you&rsquo;re not sure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the actual questions:</p>
<ol style=""list-style-type: decimal"">
<li>
<p>How many distinct Wikipedia pages do you read per week on average?</p>
<ul>
<li>less than 1</li>
<li>1 to 10</li>
<li>11 to 25</li>
<li>26 or more</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>On a search engine (e.g.&nbsp;Google) results page, do you explicitly seek Wikipedia pages, or do you passively click on Wikipedia pages only if they show up at the top of the results?</p>
<ul>
<li>I explicitly seek Wikipedia pages</li>
<li>I have a slight preference for Wikipedia pages</li>
<li>I just click on what is at the top of the results</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you usually read a particular section of a page or the whole article? (Multiple options can be selected)</p>
<ul>
<li>Particular section</li>
<li>Whole page</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>How often do you do the following? (Choices: Several times per week, About once per week, About once per month, About once per several months, Never/almost never.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the search functionality on Wikipedia</li>
<li>Be surprised that there is no Wikipedia page on a topic</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>For what fraction of pages you read do you do the following? (Choices: For every page, For most pages, For some pages, For very few pages, Never. These were displayed in a random order for each respondent, but displayed in alphabetical order here.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Check (click or hover over) at least one citation to see where the information comes from on a page you are reading</li>
<li>Check how many pageviews a page is getting (on an external site or through the Pageview API)</li>
<li>Click through/look for at least one cited source to verify the information on a page you are reading</li>
<li>Edit a page you are reading because of grammatical/typographical errors on the page</li>
<li>Edit a page you are reading to add new information</li>
<li>Look at the &ldquo;See also&rdquo; section for additional articles to read</li>
<li>Look at the editing history of a page you are reading</li>
<li>Look at the editing history solely to see if a particular user wrote the page</li>
<li>Look at the talk page of a page you are reading</li>
<li>Read a page mostly for the &ldquo;Criticisms&rdquo; or &ldquo;Reception&rdquo; (or similar) section, to understand different views on the subject</li>
<li>Share the page with a friend/acquaintance/coworker</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For the SurveyMonkey audience, there were also some demographic questions (age, gender, household income, US region, and device type). These questions were not filled by respondents at the time of the survey, but rather, are filled in by respondents in order to be able to participate in these surveys. You can learn more on the <a href=""https://contribute.surveymonkey.com/home"">SurveyMonkey Contribute page</a>.</p>
<h3 id=""second-surveymonkey-survey-s2"">Second SurveyMonkey survey (S2)</h3>
<p>After we looked at the survey responses on the first day, Issa and I decided to create a second survey to focus on the parts from the first survey that interested us the most.</p>
<h4 id=""audiences-for-s2"">Audiences for S2</h4>
<p>The second survey was only circulated among SurveyMonkey&rsquo;s audiences:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>SurveyMonkey&rsquo;s US audience with no demographic filters (54 responses).</p>
<p>Acquisition cost: $50 ($1 per response for 50 responses, 4 extra responses given gratis)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SurveyMonkey&rsquo;s US audience with the following filters: ages 18&ndash;29 with a college or graduate degree (50 responses).</p>
<p>Acquisition cost: $125 ($2.50 per response for 50 responses)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We first ran the survey on the unfiltered audience again because the wording of our first question was changed and we wanted to have the new baseline. We then chose to filter for young college-educated people because our prediction was that more educated people would be more likely to read Wikipedia. The SurveyMonkey demographic data does not include education, and we hadn&rsquo;t seen the Pew Internet Research surveys in the next section, so we were relying on our intuition and some demographic data from past surveys) for the &ldquo;college-educated&rdquo; part. Our selection of the age group was based on the fact that young people in our first survey gave more informative free-form responses in survey 2 (SurveyMonkey&rsquo;s demographic data <em>does</em> include age).</p>
<h4 id=""questions-for-s2"">Questions for S2</h4>
<p>For reference, here are the survey questions for the second survey. A dummy/mock-up version of the survey can be found here: <a class=""uri"" href=""https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/28BW78V"">https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/28BW78V</a>.</p>
<p>The survey introduction said the following:</p>

<p>This survey has 4 questions across 3 pages.</p>
<p>In this survey, &ldquo;Wikipedia page&rdquo; refers to a Wikipedia page in any language (not just the English Wikipedia).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the actual questions:</p>
<ol style=""list-style-type: decimal"">
<li>
<p>How many distinct Wikipedia pages do you read (at least one sentence of) per week on average?</p>
<ul>
<li>Fewer than 1</li>

<li>11 to 25</li>
<li>26 or more</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>

<p>As with the SurveyMonkey Audience responses for S1, the responses for S2 also came with demographic information that the respondents had previously filled in.</p>
<h3 id=""google-surveys-survey-gs"">Google Surveys survey (GS)</h3>
<p>We ran a third survey on Google Surveys (known at the time as Google Consumer Surveys) with a <em>single question</em> that was a word-to-word replica of the first question from the second survey. The main motivation here was that on Google Surveys, a single-question survey costs only 10 cents per response, so it was possible to get to a large number of responses at relatively low cost, and achieve more confidence in the tentative conclusions we had drawn from the SurveyMonkey surveys.</p>
<h4 id=""audiences-for-gs"">Audiences for GS</h4>
<p>We bought 500 responses at 10 cents per response, for a total acquisition cost of $50. The responses were from a general United States audience.</p>
<p>GS uses a &ldquo;surveywall&rdquo; methodology to collect survey responses: the survey questions are shown to people who want to access a piece of content (article or video) and they need to answer the question to access it.</p>
<p>Overall, Google Surveys in the United States is reasonably close to representative of the voting US population and the Internet-using population. Also, the sample size of the survey was largest. Therefore, among the surveys we did, this survey comes closest to approximating the behavior of the Internet-using population in the United States.</p>
<p>You can learn more at the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Surveys"">Wikipedia page for Google Surveys</a>.</p>
<h4 id=""questions-for-gs"">Questions for GS</h4>
<p>This survey had exactly one question. The wording of the question was exactly the same as that of the first question of the second survey.</p>
<ol style=""list-style-type: decimal"">
<li>
<p>How many distinct Wikipedia pages do you read (at least one sentence of) per week on average?</p>
<ul>
<li>Fewer than 1</li>
<li>1 to 10</li>
<li>11 to 25</li>
<li>26 or more</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>One slight difference was that whereas in the second SurveyMonkey survey, the order of the options was fixed, the Google Surveys survey did a 50/50 split between that order and the exact reverse order. Such splitting is a best practice to deal with any order-related biases, while still preserving the logical order of the options.</p>
<p>You can read more on the <a href=""http://www.pewresearch.org/methodology/u-s-survey-research/questionnaire-design/"">questionnaire design page of the Pew Research Center</a>.</p>
<p>The GS responses come with inferred demographic and geographic data (age, gender, income level, location). The geographic data is generally reliable because it is based on IP address, but inferred age and gender data is not as reliable as the self-reported data that we get from SurveyMonkey Audience. For more on the accuracy of the inferred data, see the <a href=""http://www.people-press.org/2012/11/07/a-comparison-of-results-from-surveys-by-the-pew-research-center-and-google-consumer-surveys/"">Pew Research Center&rsquo;s comparison</a>.</p>
<h3 id=""wikimedia-foundation-new-readers-survey-nr"">Wikimedia Foundation New Readers survey (NR)</h3>
<p>In late 2016, the Wikimedia Foundation&rsquo;s Global Reach team published the results of <a href=""https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Global_Reach/Insights"">New Readers phone surveys</a>. The questions in these surveys have some overlap with the questions in our surveys, so we have updated our post to include a discussion of these surveys and how the results compare with ours.</p>
<h4 id=""audiences-for-nr"">Audiences for NR</h4>
<p>The NR surveys were conducted in the following five countries: <a href=""https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Global_Reach/Nigeria_survey"">Nigeria</a> (2768 responses), <a href=""https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Global_Reach/India_survey"">India</a> (9235 responses), <a href=""https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Global_Reach/Mexico_Survey"">Mexico</a> (2568 responses), <a href=""https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Global_Reach/Brazil_survey"">Brazil</a> (5343 responses), and <a href=""https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Global_Reach/Egypt_survey"">Egypt</a> (3976 responses). The surveys were conducted by phone.</p>
<p>For the first three countries (Nigeria, India, and Mexico), results of additional in-person surveys have also been published.</p>
<p>We were not able to find information on the cost of the surveys, but considering the large audience size (23,890 in total), the survey length, and the labor-intensive method of conducting the survey, we estimate that it cost tens of thousands of dollars. For comparison, an <a href=""http://afkinsider.com/37030/geopoll-does-market-research-in-africa/"">article about survey firm GeoPoll</a> suggests that $10 per response is a fairly good rate for conducting surveys in some African countries.</p>
<h4 id=""questions-for-nr"">Questions for NR</h4>
<p>We will compare the results of our surveys with the results of the New Readers surveys. To shed light on this comparison, we include below the list of questions in the New Readers phone survey.</p>
<p>Not all questions were presented in all surveys. The <a href=""https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Global_Reach/Egypt_survey"">Egypt survey</a>, which is the more recent, had the longest list of questions, and we provide this list below. The numbering is mostly based on the Egypt survey, though off by one for later questions due to a question missing from the Egypt survey.</p>
<p>Our later analysis will focus on the first, fourth, and seventh question, which are together comparable against the first question of S1, S2, and GS.</p>

<h2 id=""other-surveys"">Other surveys</h2>
<p>Several demographic surveys regarding Wikipedia have been conducted, targeting both editors and users. The surveys we found most helpful were the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20130717211630/http://wikipediastudy.org/"">2010 Wikipedia survey</a> by the Collaborative Creativity Group and the Wikimedia Foundation. The explanation before the bottom table on page 7 of the <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20131209060146/http://wikipediastudy.org/docs/Wikipedia_Overview_15March2010-FINAL.pdf"">overview PDF</a> has &ldquo;Contributors show slightly but significantly higher education levels than readers&rdquo;, which provides weak evidence that more educated people are more likely to engage with Wikipedia.</li>
<li>The <a href=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/Global_South_User_Survey_2014_-_Full_Analysis_Report.pdf"">Global South User Survey 2014</a> by the Wikimedia Foundation</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.pewinternet.org/files/old-media/Files/Reports/2011/PIP_Wikipedia.pdf"">Pew Internet Research&rsquo;s 2011 survey</a>: &ldquo;Education level continues to be the strongest predictor of Wikipedia use. The collaborative encyclopedia is most popular among internet users with at least a college degree, 69% of whom use the site.&rdquo; (page 3)</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.pewinternet.org/2007/04/24/wikipedia-users/"">Pew Internet Research&rsquo;s 2007 survey</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is also the New Readers survey mentioned earlier, that we examine in detail in this post.</p>
<h2 id=""motivation"">Motivation</h2>
<p>Issa and I ultimately want to get a better sense of the value of a Wikipedia pageview (one way to measure the impact of content creation), and one way to do this is to understand how people are using Wikipedia. As we focus on <a href=""http://effective-altruism.com/ea/150/looking_for_global_healthrelated_wikipedia/"">getting more people to work on editing Wikipedia</a> &ndash; thus causing more people to read the content we pay and help to create &ndash; it becomes more important to understand who is reading the content, and how they engage with it.</p>
<p>For some previous discussion, see also my answers to the following Quora questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><a title=""April 16, 2016."" href=""https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-various-parameters-that-affect-the-value-of-a-pageview/answer/Vipul-Naik"">What are the various parameters that affect the value of a pageview?</a></li>
<li><a title=""August 30, 2014."" href=""https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-relative-social-value-of-1-Quora-pageview-as-measured-by-Quora-stats-http-www-quora-com-stats-and-1-Wikipedia-pageview-as-measured-at-say-Wikipedia-article-traffic-statistics/answer/Vipul-Naik"">What&rsquo;s the relative social value of 1 Quora pageview (as measured by Quora stats http://www.quora.com/stats/) and 1 Wikipedia pageview (as measured at, say, Wikipedia article traffic statistics)?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Wikipedia allows relatively easy access to pageview data (especially by using tools developed for this purpose, including <a href=""https://wikipediaviews.org/"">one that I made</a>), and there are some surveys that provide demographic data (see <a href=""#other-surveys"">&ldquo;Other surveys&rdquo;</a> above). However, after looking around, it was apparent that the kind of information our survey was designed to find was not available. This was before the New Readers survey results had been published.</p>
<h2 id=""results"">Results</h2>
<p>In this section we present the highlights from each of the survey questions. If you prefer to dig into the data yourself, there are also some <a href=""#summaries-of-responses-exports-for-surveymonkey-weblink-for-google-surveys"">exported PDFs below</a> provided by SurveyMonkey. Most of the inferences can be made using these PDFs, but there are some cases where additional filters are needed to deduce certain percentages.</p>
<p>For the SurveyMonkey surveys, we use the notation &ldquo;S<em>n</em>Q<em>m</em>&rdquo; to mean &ldquo;survey <em>n</em> question <em>m</em>&rdquo;. The Google Surveys survey question is referred to as GS, and the New Readers questions are referred to with the notation &ldquo;NRQ<em>m</em>&rdquo; for question <em>m</em> of the survey.</p>

</table>
<p>The &ldquo;pgs/wk lower&rdquo; is obtained as the average pages read per week if everybody read at the lower end of their estimate (so the respective estimates are 0, 1, 11, and 26).</p>
<p>The &ldquo;pgs/wk upper&rdquo; is obtained as the average of pages read per week if everybody read at the upper end of their estimate, except the &ldquo;26 or more&rdquo; case where we assume a value of 50 (so the respective estimates are 1, 10, 25, and 50). We choose 50 as a reasonable upper bound on what the average person who views more than 26 pages likely views, rather than a strict bound on every individual.</p>
<p>There are two reasons to compute the &ldquo;pgs/wk lower&rdquo; and &ldquo;pgs/wk upper&rdquo; numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Having these ranges makes it easier to quickly compare different audiences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The (very approximate) estimates of pages/week can be validated against known information about total pageviews.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The comments indicated that S1Q1 was flawed in several ways: we didn&rsquo;t specify which language Wikipedias count nor what it meant to &ldquo;read&rdquo; an article (the whole page, a section, or just a sentence?).</p>
<p>One comment questioned the &ldquo;low&rdquo; ceiling of 26; however, the actual distribution of responses suggests that the ceiling wasn&rsquo;t too low.</p>
<p>An interesting potential modification of the survey would be to ask further questions of people who selected an extreme response, to better bucket them.</p>
<h3 id=""s1q2-affinity-for-wikipedia-in-search-results"">S1Q2: affinity for Wikipedia in search results</h3>
<p>We asked Q2, &ldquo;On a search engine (e.g.&nbsp;Google) results page, do you explicitly seek Wikipedia pages, or do you passively click on Wikipedia pages only if they show up at the top of the results?&rdquo;, to see to what extent people preferred Wikipedia in search results.</p>
<p>The main implication to this for people who do content creation on Wikipedia is that if people do explicitly seek Wikipedia pages (for whatever reason), it makes sense to give them more of what they want. On the other hand, if people don&rsquo;t prefer Wikipedia, it makes sense to update in favor of diversifying one&rsquo;s content creation efforts while still keeping in mind that raw pageviews indicate that content will be read more if placed on Wikipedia (see for instance <a title=""Brian Tomasik. &ldquo;The Value of Wikipedia Contributions in Social Sciences&rdquo; &sect; Readership. 2015. Essays on Reducing Suffering."" href=""http://reducing-suffering.org/the-value-of-wikipedia-contributions-in-social-sciences/#Readership"">Brian Tomasik&rsquo;s experience</a>, which is similar to my own, or <a title=""gwern branwen. &ldquo;Wikipedia and Other Wikis&rdquo;.

<p>An oversight on our part was not to include an option for people who avoided Wikipedia or did something else. This became apparent from the comments. For this reason, the &ldquo;Just click on top results&rdquo; options might be inflated. In addition, some comments indicated a mixed strategy of preferring Wikipedia for general overviews while avoiding it for specific inquiries, so allowing multiple selections might have been better for this question.</p>
<h3 id=""s1q3-section-vs-whole-page"">S1Q3: section vs whole page</h3>
<p>This question is relevant for us because the <a title=""Vipul Naik. &quot;List of new articles that any interested author can work on&quot;. GitHub."" href=""https://github.com/vipulnaik/contractwork/blob/master/new-article-pool.mediawiki"">work we fund</a> is mainly whole-page creation. If people are mostly reading the introduction or a particular section like the &ldquo;Criticisms&rdquo; or &ldquo;Reception&rdquo; section (see <a href=""#s1q5-behavior-on-pages"">S1Q5</a>), then that forces us to consider spending more time on those sections, or to strengthen those sections on weak existing pages.</p>
<p>Responses to this question were fairly consistent across different audiences, as can be see in the following table.</p>

<p>Many people noted here that rather than using Wikipedia&rsquo;s search functionality, they use Google with &ldquo;wiki&rdquo; attached to their query, DuckDuckGo&rsquo;s &ldquo;!w&rdquo; expression, or some browser configuration to allow a quick search on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>To be more thorough about discovering people&rsquo;s content discovery methods, we should have asked about other methods as well. We did ask about the &ldquo;See also&rdquo; section in <a href=""#s1q5-behavior-on-pages"">S1Q5</a>.</p>
<p>Next, we asked how often people are surprised that there is no Wikipedia page on a topic to gauge to what extent people notice a &ldquo;gap&rdquo; between how Wikipedia exists today and how it <em>could</em> exist. We were curious about what articles people specifically found missing, so we followed up with <a href=""#s2q4-free-response-of-surprise-at-lack-of-wikipedia-pages"">S2Q4</a>.</p>

<p>The table above provides a good ranking of how often people perform these actions on pages, but not the distribution information (which would require three dimensions to present fully). In general, the more common actions (scores of 2.5&ndash;4) had responses that clustered among &ldquo;For some pages&rdquo;, &ldquo;For very few pages&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Never&rdquo;, while the less common actions (scores above 4) had responses that clustered mainly in &ldquo;Never&rdquo;.</p>

(The explicit allowing of any language was in the introduction to the survey and not part of the question itself). We have also presented the survey 1 results for the SurveyMonkey audience in the corresponding rows, but note that because of the change in wording, the correspondence isn&rsquo;t exact.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;pgs/wk lower&rdquo; is obtained as the average pages read per week if everybody read at the lower end of their estimate (so the respective estimates are 0, 1, 11, and 26). The &ldquo;pgs/wk upper&rdquo; is obtained as the average of pages read per week if everybody read at the upper end of their estimate, except the &ldquo;26 or more&rdquo; case where we assume a value of 50 (so the respective estimates are 1, 10, 25, and 50). For more, see the <a href=""#s1q1-number-of-wikipedia-pages-read-per-week"">S1Q1 explanation</a>.</p>
<p>Comparing SM with S1SM, we see that probably because of the wording, the percentages have drifted in the direction of more pages read. It might be surprising that the young educated audience seems to have a smaller fraction of heavy users than the general population. However note that each group only had ~50 responses, and that we have no education information for the SM group.</p>

<p>Below are four plots of the data. Note that r_s denotes <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spearman%27s_rank_correlation_coefficient"">Spearman&rsquo;s rank correlation coefficient</a>. Spearman&rsquo;s rank correlation coefficient is used instead of Pearson&rsquo;s <em>r</em> because the former is less affected by outliers. Note also that the percentage of respondents who viewed a page counts each respondent once, whereas the number of pageviews does not have this restriction (i.e.&nbsp;duplicate pageviews count), so we wouldn&rsquo;t expect the relationship to be entirely linear even if the survey audiences were perfectly representative of the general population.</p>

<h3 id=""s2q3-free-response-of-articles-read"">S2Q3: free response of articles read</h3>
<p>The most common response was along the lines of &ldquo;None&rdquo;, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&rdquo;, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember&rdquo;, or similar. Among the more useful responses were:</p>
<ul>
<li>News stories (e.g. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Harambe"">Death of Harambe</a>, &ldquo;WikiLeaks scandal&rdquo; &ndash; unclear which page this is, since there are several pages on various aspects of WikiLeaks)</li>
<li>Popular culture: 
<ul>
<li>People including <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megan_Fox"">Megan Fox</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James"">LeBron James</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rita_Hayworth"">Rita Hayworth</a></li>
<li>Works including <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aladdin_and_the_King_of_Thieves"">Aladdin and the King of Thieves</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men:_Apocalypse"">X-Men: Apocalypse</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>More traditional encyclopedic information (e.g. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerald_ash_borer"">Emerald ash borer</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain"">Spain</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siphonophorae"">Siphonophorae</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scolopendra_gigantea"">Scolopendra gigantea</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=""s2q4-free-response-of-surprise-at-lack-of-wikipedia-pages"">S2Q4: free response of surprise at lack of Wikipedia pages</h3>
<p>As with the previous question, the most common response was along the lines of &ldquo;None&rdquo;, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&rdquo;, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember&rdquo;, &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t happen&rdquo;, or similar.</p>
<p>The most useful responses were classes of things: &ldquo;particular words&rdquo;, &ldquo;French plays/books&rdquo;, &ldquo;Random people&rdquo;, &ldquo;obscure people&rdquo;, &ldquo;Specific list pages of movie genres&rdquo;, &ldquo;Foreign actors&rdquo;, &ldquo;various insect pages&rdquo;, and so forth.</p>
<h3 id=""gs"">GS</h3>
<p>The survey was circulated to a target size of 500 in the United States (no demographic filters), and received 501 responses.</p>
<p>Since there was only one question, but we obtained data filtered by demographics in many different ways, we present this table with the columns denoting responses and the rows denoting the audience segments.</p>
<p>We also include the S1Q1SM, S2Q1SM, and S2Q1CEYP responses for easy comparison. Note that S1Q1SM did not include the &ldquo;at least one sentence of&rdquo; caveat. We believe that adding this caveat would push people&rsquo;s estimates upward.</p>
<p>If you view the Google Surveys results <a href=""https://www.google.com/insights/consumersurveys/view?survey=o3iworx2rcfixmn2x5shtlppci&amp;question=1&amp;filter=&amp;rw=1"">online</a> you will also see the 95% confidence intervals for each of the segments. Note that percentages in a row may not add up to 100% due to rounding or due to people entering &ldquo;Other&rdquo; responses. For the entire GS audience, every pair of options had a statistically significant difference, but for some subsegments, this was not true.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;pgs/wk range&rdquo; is obtained as follows. The lower bound is obtained as the average pages read per week if everybody read at the lower end of their estimate (so the respective estimates are 0, 1, 11, and 26). The upper bound is obtained as the average of pages read per week if everybody read at the upper end of their estimate, except the &ldquo;26 or more&rdquo; case where we assume a value of 50 (so the respective estimates are 1, 10, 25, and 50). For more, see the <a href=""#s1q1-number-of-wikipedia-pages-read-per-week"">S1Q1 explanation</a>.</p>
<p>We can see that the overall GS data vindicates the broad conclusions we drew from SurveyMonkey data. Moreover, most GS segments with a sufficiently large number of responses (50 or more) display a similar trend as the overall data. One exception is that younger audiences seem to be slightly less likely to use Wikipedia very little (i.e.&nbsp;fall in the &ldquo;Fewer than 1&rdquo; category), and older audiences seem slightly more likely to use Wikipedia very little.</p>
<h3 id=""data-validation-using-known-total-united-states-wikipedia-pageviews"">Data validation using known total United States Wikipedia pageviews</h3>
<p>Using the <a href=""https://stats.wikimedia.org/wikimedia/squids/SquidReportPageViewsPerCountryBreakdownHuge.htm"">country breakdown data</a> for traffic to Wikipedia, we see that Wikipedia received 3.54 billion views in the United States for a recent 30-day period, which translates to about 827 million weekly pageviews.</p>
<p>Estimates for the number of active Internet users in the United States vary, based on definition, between 150 million and 290 million. With these estimates, we get a range of 2.85&ndash;5.51 for the number of pageviews per week for a United States user. We see that this range is loosely within the range for the SurveyMonkey surveys as well as Google Surveys. In other words, the survey data is loosely plausible and consistent with known facts.</p>
<h3 id=""nrq1-do-you-use-the-internet-and-nrq4-have-you-ever-heard-of-wikipedia"">NRQ1: Do you use the Internet? and NRQ4: Have you ever heard of Wikipedia?</h3>
<p>Both questions were asked in the New Readers phone survey for all five countries. NRQ1 was the same across all countries (though for Egypt, the &ldquo;No&rdquo; responses were further split to separate people who used Facebook). NRQ4 was asked as Q3 in Nigeria, Mexico, and Brazil.</p>
<p>We additionally want to know the percentage of Internet users who have heard of Wikipedia, as this will be useful later when making estimates of total pages/week read by people. We don&rsquo;t directly know this number. However, if we assume that the people who have heard of Wikipedia are a subset of the people who use the Internet, then we can compute this percentage as the ratio of the percentage of Yes responses to NRQ4 and NRQ1. This assumption is a reasonable proxy for reality, so we will use the ratio as a stand-in for the percentage of Internet users who have heard of Wikipedia.</p>

<p>An interesting note of comparison: for the surveys we circulated, we did not even ask people if they had heard of Wikipedia. The implicit assumption was that people had heard of Wikipedia. This assumption was probably reasonable in the contexts we operated in, and it didn&rsquo;t make sense to waste a question (and the underlying survey costs) on getting that information.</p>

<p>The pgs/wk range is calculated as follows. For daily use, we assume between 4 and 50 views a week. For weekly use, we assume between 1 and 5 views a week. For monthly use, we assume between 0.2 and 1 view a week. We do not count any contribution for &ldquo;Rarely&rdquo; and &ldquo;Never&rdquo;.</p>
<p>We also calculate the percentages relative to the set of all survey respondents (so that the denominator now includes people who have never heard of Wikipedia) and add all the ones who didn&rsquo;t respond to the Never column:</p>

<p>The combin can be compared with S1Q1, S2Q1, and GS. However, the buckets presented to users were very different. The potential correspondence is below.</p>
<ol style=""list-style-type: decimal"">
<li>
<p>How many distinct Wikipedia pages do you read (at least one sentence of) per week on average?</p>
<ul>
<li>Fewer than 1: This corresponds to Monthly, Rarely, and Never.</li>
<li>1 to 10: This corresponds to Weekly and a subset of Daily.</li>
<li>11 to 25: This mostly corresponds to Daily.</li>
<li>26 or more: This mostly corresponds to Daily.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The data show that the people surveyed read Wikipedia less than the SurveyMonkey Audience and Google Surveys audiences. The total of the Monthly, Rarely, and Never columns for each of the five countries is over 70%, and it is over 80% for all countries other than Mexico. The corresponding &ldquo;Fewer than 1&rdquo; percentage for each iteration of urveyMonkey Audience and Google Surveys is less than 50%, and even on subsegments it is less than 60%.</p>
<p>In other words, the surveys suggest that Wikipedia use is less in the five countries than in the United States.</p>
<h3 id=""data-validation-against-known-total-country-traffic"">Data validation against known total country traffic</h3>
<p>We get the estimate for weekly traffic by scaling from 30 days to 7 days the <a href=""https://stats.wikimedia.org/wikimedia/squids/SquidReportPageViewsPerCountryBreakdownHuge.htm"">country breakdown data</a>. Data was captured on December 23, 2016.</p>
<p>We get Internet-using population estimates from the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_number_of_Internet_users"">Wikipedia page</a>, which in turn relies on Internet Live Stats. Estimates were captured on December 23, 2016. We use this data rather than the data from stats.wikimedia.org since this data is more up to date, and includes extrapolated estimates rather than the most recent confirmed estimate.</p>
<p>Internet user and weekly pageview counts are in the millions. The range is the one computed based on the Internet-using population.</p>
<p>We see that the pgs/wk number is a little lower than the range for the case of Nigeria and India, with the gap particularly huge in Nigeria. Otherwise, however, the ranges are plausible and so the pageview data loosely validates the survey results.</p>

<h2 id=""takeaway-huge-gap-between-heavy-users-and-general-us-audience-plus-predictors-of-heavy-use"">Takeaway: Huge gap between heavy users and general US audience, plus predictors of heavy use</h2>
<p>The most striking finding to us was just how wide the gap is between audiences such as Vipul&rsquo;s Facebook friends and Slate Star Codex on the one hand, and general US Internet users (as measured through SurveyMonkey Audience and Google Surveys) on the other.</p>
<h3 id=""confirming-the-gap-with-numbers"">Confirming the gap with numbers</h3>
<p>Here are three different ways to slice the data to confirm the gap between the audiences.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Percentage of respondents who view less than 1 Wikipedia page per week: For Vipul&rsquo;s Facebook friends, Slate Star Codex, and the Analytics mailing list, this was 0% or 1%.</p>
<p>In contrast, for all the SurveyMonkey Audience and Google Surveys segments considered, this was 25% or higher, with the most general US audiences and largest sample sizes giving numbers between 40% and 60%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Estimated pages/week range: For Vipul&rsquo;s friends, Slate Star Codex, and the Analytics mailing list, the lower end was 9 or higher, and the upper end was 19 or higher.</p>
<p>In contrast, for all the SurveyMonkey Audience and Google Surveys segments considered, the lower end was less than 5 and the upper end was less than 15.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Percentage of respondents who view 26 or more Wikipedia pages per week: For Vipul&rsquo;s friends, Slate Star Codex, and the Analytics mailing list, the number was 16%, 27%, and 57% respectively. In contrast, for all the SurveyMonkey Audience and Google Surveys segments, this percentage was less than 13%, and for most of the larger segments it was less than 7%.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=""qualitative-differences-in-other-aspects-of-wikipedia-engagement"">Qualitative differences in other aspects of Wikipedia engagement</h3>
<p>Through the additional questions in S1, we got evidence for these statements, true both for heavy users, and for audiences that have a larger proportion of heavy users:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>They tend to explicitly seek Wikipedia in search results (S1Q2).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They are more likely to be surprised at the absence of a Wikipedia page (S1Q4).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They are more likely to use the search functionality witihn Wikipedia (S1Q4).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They are considerably more likely to engage with page content in various ways, including looking at the See Also section, sharing the page, focusing on Criticisms and Reception, checking citations, and checking the talk page (S1Q5).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>However:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>They are not too different from the general US audience in terms of the extent to which they read a section versus the whole page (S1Q3).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They are not noticeably more likely to engage in editing actions on Wikipedia (in other words, active Wikipedia editors constituted a small fraction of heavy users) (S1Q5).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=""predictors-of-audiences-with-high-proportions-of-heavy-users"">Predictors of audiences with high proportions of heavy users</h3>
<p>Of the three audiences with a high proportion of heavy Wikipedia users: Vipul&rsquo;s Facebook friends, Slate Star Codex, and the Wikimedia Analytics mailing list, only the third has an obvious connection with Wikipedia. The first two audiences are not directly linked to Wikipedia, and this is evidenced somewhat by the low rate of Wikipedia editing in these audiences. This suggests that visiting a specific website or being in a specific friend group on social media can be good predictors of heavy Wikipedia use without necessarily predicting Wikipedia editing.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to run this survey among audiences of different websites and people in different friend networks to get a better sense of what attributes predict high Wikipedia use.</p>
<h2 id=""takeaway-effect-on-impact-estimates-for-pageviews"">Takeaway: Effect on impact estimates for pageviews</h2>
<p>As described in the <a href=""#motivation"">Motivation section</a>, our interest in the topic stems partly from a desire to quantify the value of individual Wikipedia pageviews. The results we obtained caused us to revise our estimate upward, but with the important caveat of downgrading the reach of Wikipedia.</p>
<h3 id=""upgrading-estimate-of-impact-based-on-reader-quality"">Upgrading estimate of impact based on reader quality</h3>
<p>For some pages, the main way it is impactful is if the right set of people read it. For such a page, getting 1,000 pageviews from the right people (the ones with the information, authority, and skill to act on it) is more valuable than getting 1,000 pageviews from people who happen to visit the page accidentally.</p>
<p>The qualities we have identified for heavy Wikipedia users around their explicit seeking of Wikipedia as well as their use of advanced features on Wikipedia to verify facts and learn more, give us a little more confidence that pages are being read by the right people who are equipped to take action on them.</p>
<p>Additionally, other information we have about the audiences with high proportions of heavy users (specifically, that they are friends with Vipul, read Slate Star Codex, or are on the Analytics mailing list) also give us reason to be optimistic about these readers relative to general Internet users.</p>
<h3 id=""potentially-downgrading-estimate-of-impact-through-reach"">Potentially downgrading estimate of impact through reach</h3>
<p>For some pages and Wikipedia use cases, the impact pathway crucially depends on a lot of people in diverse contexts and life situations reading it. The results we have obtained suggest, very tentatively, that the views on a given page are likely to come from a less diverse audience than we might naively think.</p>
<p>For instance, let&rsquo;s say we go on a spree to significantly improve Wikipedia&rsquo;s coverage of 100 pages related to healthy living habits, and we then see that the pages we&rsquo;ve improved got 10 million pageviews collectively.</p>
<p>Naively, we might have thought that we were reaching millions of users. However, if a lot of Wikipedia&rsquo;s pageviews come from heavy users, there&rsquo;s a good chance that those 10 million pageviews came from a few hundred thousand of these heavy users.</p>
<p>For any given page or set of pages, we can only speculate. Therefore, this downgrading is only potential, and is accompanied by considerable uncertainty.</p>
<h2 id=""takeaway-gap-with-elites-is-stronger-than-demographic-gaps-in-us-but-comparable-to-gap-between-us-and-low-income-countries"">Takeaway: Gap with elites is stronger than demographic gaps in US but comparable to gap between US and low-income countries</h2>
<h3 id=""gender-within-the-united-states"">Gender within the United States</h3>
<p>For S1, S2, and GS, males in the general US audience used Wikipedia a bit more than females in the general US audience. The biggest and clearest gap was in the percentage of people who view less than 1 Wikipedia page. The gaps were as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>S1Q1: 25% of males and 58% of females view less than 1 Wikipedia page per week.</li>
<li>S2Q1: 32% of males and 42% of females view fewer than 1 Wikipedia page per week.</li>
<li>GS: 41% of males and 52% of females view fewer than 1 Wikipedia page per week.</li>
</ul>
<p>The gaps at the higher end of pages/week were less statistically robust because the percentages were too small, and therefore easily affected by outlier individuals. With that said, the overall pages/week ranges for men were mostly higher than those for women, as expected.</p>
<p>The gender gap in reading (which should be distinguished from the gender gap in editing) is consistent with <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0740818810000356"">past research on gender differences in Wikipedia reading</a> and also with the surveys mentioned in the <a href=""#other-surveys"">Other surveys</a> section. It&rsquo;s particularly interesting to compare it against the 2007 and 2011 Pew surveys, both of which target a United States audience.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In 2007, 39% of males and 34% of females answered Yes to the question &ldquo;Do you ever use the Internet to look for information on Wikipedia?&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 2011, 56% of males and 50% of females answered Yes to the same question.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While it&rsquo;s a bit hard to sensibly compare these magnitudes with the magnitudes we obtained, the data does directionally support the idea of a gender gap in Wikipedia reading.</p>
<p>The gender gap in reading is small compared to the difference with Vipul&rsquo;s Facebook friends, Slate Star Codex, and the Analytics Mailing List, all of which had 0% or 1% of people viewing less than 1 Wikipedia page per week.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, for the three audiences (Vipul&rsquo;s Facebook friends, Slate Star Codex, and the Analytics mailing list), we do not have gender data for individual respondents. The audiences from which the respondents were drawn are between 60% and 80% male, but it&rsquo;s plausible that the actual respondents had a gender proportion outside this range.</p>
<h3 id=""age-within-the-united-states"">Age within the United States</h3>
<p>For S1 and S2, the number of people within each age bucket was too small to draw any conclusion. We did notice that on S2, older people were less likely to enter optional comments, but we don&rsquo;t know why (it could be because of greater difficulty typing rather than anything specific to Wikipedia).</p>
<p>For GS, we saw a clear age gradient. In particular, older pepole were more likely to select the &ldquo;Fewer than 1&rdquo; option for the number of Wikipedia pages they read per week. Here&rsquo;s a snippet from the <a href=""#gs"">Google Surveys results table</a> showing that.</p>

</table>
<p>These age differences are broadly in line with common sense: the Internet is used more by people in younger age groups. For Wikipedia in particular, school and college motivate a lot of Wikipedia use. Hence the general summer dip for pageviews to many Wikipedia article; see the <a href=""https://wikipediaviews.org/displayviewsformultiplemonths.php?tag=American+Civil+War&amp;allmonths=allmonths&amp;language=en&amp;drilldown=desktop&amp;normalization=dailyaverage"">American Civil War</a> as an example. The school/college motivation makes Wikipedia more useful to school- and college-age audiences.</p>
<p>Pew results from both 2007 and 2011 confirm the age pattern. The gradients for the two years on the question &ldquo;Do you ever use the Internet to look for information on Wikipedia?&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>2007: 18&ndash;29 at 44%, 30&ndash;49 at 38%, 50&ndash;64 at 31%, 65+ at 26%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2011: 18&ndash;29 at 62%, 30&ndash;49 at 52%, 50&ndash;64 at 49%, 65+ at 33%.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These age differences pale in comparison with the differences with Vipul&rsquo;s Facebook friends, Slate Star Codex, and the Analytics mailing list, all of which had 1% or less of their users viewing fewer than 1 page per week.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, for the three audiences (Vipul&rsquo;s Facebook friends, Slate Star Codex, and the Analytics mailing list), we do not have age data for individual respondents. The audiences from which the respondents were drawn are mostly in the 18&ndash;24, 25&ndash;34, and 35&ndash;44 age groups.</p>
<h3 id=""cross-country-comparison-in-perspective"">Cross-country comparison in perspective</h3>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an ordering by Wikipedia use:</p>
<p>Low-income countries (India, Nigeria, Brazil, Egypt) &lt; Mexico &lt; United States &lt; Audiences such as Vipul&rsquo;s Facebook friends, Slate Star Codex, Analytics mailing list &lt; Heavy users</p>
<p>Here are the estimates:</p>
<ul>
<li>Low-income countries: 0.05 to 0.6 pages/week per Internet user (based on actual pageview data)</li>
<li>Mexico: Around 1 page/week per Internet user (based on actual pageview data)</li>
<li>United States: Between 2.85 and 5.51 pages/week per Internet user (based on actual pageview data)</li>
<li>Vipul&rsquo;s Facebook friends and Slate Star Codex: Between 9 and 26 pages/week per Internet user (inferred from survey responses)</li>
<li>Heavy users: At least 26 pages/week per Internet user (by definition)</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, we see that the gap from the United States average to a heavy user is about the same as the gap from a low-income country to the United States.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another way of thinking about it. Wikipedia as a whole got about 16 billion pageviews over a recent 30-day period. If Internet users everywhere used it as much as they do in the United States (even at current Internet penetration rates) Wikipedia would get around double that many pageviews, or about 32 billion a month. If Internet users everywhere used Wikipedia as much as Slate Star Codex readers, Wikipedia would get between 150 billion and 300 billion pageviews a month (a number comparable to the total number of Google searches performed worldwide). If everybody in the world had Internet connectivity and used Wikipedia as much as Slate Star Codex readers do, Wikipedia would get between 400 billion and 800 billion monthly pageviews.</p>

So an intuitive counter to this focus is the &ldquo;expected error,&rdquo; or how much we expect the expected value to be incorrect.

These can get much of the point across in many situations but not all. Confidence intervals have difficulties resembling distributions that aren&rsquo;t very smooth. For instance, say you have a two deals, both with a 98% chance of making $1 Million. One of them has a 2% chance of making nothing, the other has a 2% chance of losing $50 Million. A 95% confidence interval would treat these two identically. Mean absolute deviation handles this distinction.</span></p>

At this point you can&rsquo;t really compare them, except for giving each equal weight. With this information alone it&rsquo;s not very obvious how much they actually agree with each other, or if one spent far longer on the analysis than the other.</span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial; font-size: 14.6667px; white-space: pre-wrap;"">Now imagine if the first presented 20 with an expected error of 5, and the other presented 43 with an expected error of 30. Here a story begins to develop. The first figured out some method that made them quite confident. The second wasn&rsquo;t very sure; a true value of 20 could be reasonable according to the expected error of 30. In this case you&rsquo;d probably lean closer to 20 than 43. </span></p>

Say you needed to estimate revenue for 2020. You make a forecast and it has a high expected error. A few years later you have more information, and you make a second forecast with lower expected error. When the time happens you may be able to make a measurement with no expected error.</span></p>

Here it would be useful to treat each expected error term as being represented in similar ways, so that mathematical assumptions could be made to cover the entire pipeline. This may be a bit of a contrived example, but the point is that these different types of error are often handled differently and discussed using very different terminology, and if that could be changed interesting combinations may emerge.</span></p>

However, it still strongly implies predictions of future things of consequential impact. If you estimated the number of piano tuners in Boston to be between 5 and 500 for a fun stats problem, I imagine you wouldn&rsquo;t label that answer as being &lsquo;high risk.&rsquo;</span></p>

First, it should be mentioned that there is significant literature that assumes that uncertainty is defined as being unquantifiable. Second, in discussions of communication, there is no expected error at the point of a sender, only for for receivers. If uncertainty were to be used it would be have to be understood that it exists isolated to specific agents, which I imagine could be a bit counter-intuitive to some. Perhaps &lsquo;expected error&rsquo; can be described as analogues to &lsquo;perspective uncertainty&rsquo; or similar narrowed concepts.</span></p>

<p>Tomorrow, to celebrate a certain well-known&nbsp;<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton_in_popular_culture#Newtonmas"">event</a>, I'll be posting another story of a Utopia. Unlike the <a href=""/lw/8zs/just_another_day_in_utopia/"">previous attempt</a>, this is utopia on hard mode.</p>
<p>What does that mean? Well, utopias are pretty hard to write anyway. Writing needs challenges for the characters, and that's trivially easy in a dystopia (everything is a challenge), a fake utopia (the challenge is to to look beneath the facade, and fight the secret enemy), or even imperfect utopias (the challenge is to solve the remaining problems). Iain M. Bank's <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Culture"">Culture</a> illustrates another way you can write about utopias and keep them interesting: by having an external foe as a challenge.</p>
<p>I avoided all those tricks. The challenge then was to write about a genuine utopia, one that people would enjoy living in, without any hidden flaws or enemies, internal or external. And these had to be real people doing things they wanted to do, rather than <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_(Plato)"">idealised</a><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia_(book)""> people</a> <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Looking_Backward"">doing</a> <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_from_Nowhere"">things</a> <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Modern_Utopia"">they</a> <em><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Atlantis"">should</a></em> <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houyhnhnm"">do</a>. Basically a real utopia has to contain internet trolls and various fanatics, and still be a great place for everyone.</p>
<p>The setting is a future Earth that is full-fledged techno-utopia, full of powerful artificial intelligences (with <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Superintelligence-Dangers-Strategies-Nick-Bostrom/dp/1501227742"">human-friendly goals</a>, of course), <a href=""http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/brain-emulation-roadmap-report.pdf"">uploads</a> (human minds run on computers), massive technological developments, and the beginning of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQTfuI-9jIo&amp;t=1s"">universal space colonisation</a>.</p>
<p>In one sense, this made the story easier to write - nobody argues over the last leg of lamb needed to prevent starvation. In another sense, it made it much harder. Any human could desire to purge themselves of sinful thoughts, upgrade themselves to superintelligence, or copy themselves ten trillion times. And the AIs could perfectly grant them their wish - but should they? If so, do they let arbitrarily bad consequences happen? And if not, how do they go about forbidding things in a utopia? And what happens to disputes between humans - like when one person wants to join a group and the members of the group don't want to let them in? Can you prevent social nastiness - but then what about those people who want to be nasty?</p>
<p>You can read the story to see how well or badly I've answered these challenges. The Utopia was inspired a lot by Eliezer's <a href=""/lw/xy/the_fun_theory_sequence/"">fun sequence</a>, Scott Alexander's <a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/06/07/archipelago-and-atomic-communitarianism/"">Archipelago</a>, and <a href=""http://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Main_Page"">LARP</a>. The general principles are that there has to be a functioning society behind everything, that people can become whatever they want to be (eventually, and after a lot of challenges, if need be), and that the good aspects of everything must be preserved, if possible.</p>
<p>To explain that last point: it's clear that tolerant liberal democracies are better places than repressive theocracies. But repressive theocracies will probably have certain positive aspects lacking in democracies (maybe a sense of place? an enjoyable resignation to fate or government?). The challenge is to take that positive aspect, fill it out, and make it available without the rest of the baggage. Similarly, the quote ""death brings meaning to life"" is nonsense, but there's something in that idea-space - something about contemplating the brevity of existence, and the perspective it gives - that is worth preserving. For some people or most people (or groups), if not necessarily for all people in all groups. Similarly, good outcomes often have bad aspects. So the engineering challenge is to separate the good aspects of all experiences from the bad, gaining the wisdom or experience without the intolerable pain and anxiety.</p>
<p>Since I tried to cram the maximum of ideas in, the story suffers from a certain degree of ""tell, not show"". Now, this is very much in the tradition of utopias (it's ""Plato's Republic"", not ""Exciting Adventures in Plato's Republic (XXX-rated!!!!)""), but it is a narrative, and hopefully it's clear there's the potential for more - for much more.</p>
<p>In any case, I hope it works, and gives people something to aim for.</p>

<h2>Minority Retort</h2>
<p>I made a claim in <a href=""https://putanumonit.com/2016/11/23/climbing-the-horseshoe/"" target=""_blank"">Climbing the Horseshoe</a> that <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/o5n/polarization_is_the_problem_normalization_is_the/dhv4"" target=""_blank"">even Sarah Constantin misunderstood</a>, which means that I wrote it poorly. I&#8217;ll try to spell it out again, and set it apart from other arguments.</p>
<p>My point was that it&#8217;s important to recognize when you&#8217;re holding an unpopular opinion and to change your tactics accordingly. Even if <em>normatively </em>you are right and everyone is wrong, <em>instrumentally </em>you should pursue your goals one way if 5% share your goals and worldview and another way if 80% do. For example, shaming others and calling them names (e.g. <em>bigot </em>or<em> traitor) </em>works (sometimes) if you&#8217;re part of the majority and doesn&#8217;t work if you&#8217;re part of the fringe.</p>
<p>Even if your entire social circle shares your views, you have to be cognizant of the amount of support your position has in the broad public. It&#8217;s not quite what <em><a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Outside_view"" target=""_blank"">outside view</a></em> is, but it requires a similar mental process of stepping outside your immediate surroundings. Here are a couple of examples from my own life:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href=""https://putanumonit.com/2016/08/23/conversation-with-god/"" target=""_blank"">I&#8217;m an atheist</a>, and many of my friends are atheist, but I realize that on a <a href=""http://www.pewforum.org/2015/05/12/americas-changing-religious-landscape/"" target=""_blank"">national scale</a> atheists are a tiny minority (~4%). If I want to promote atheism, I should be able to tell the difference between ardent religious zealots and the median American who believes in God and goes to church every other week but isn&#8217;t <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/2d/talking_snakes_a_cautionary_tale/"" target=""_blank"">a talking snake-ist</a>. When I talk with the latter about atheism, I politely explain for example how an atheist can share the intuition that murder is wrong with a holy book. I don&#8217;t tell anyone who believes in a deity that they&#8217;re a deluded fanatic.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m a <a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/12/08/a-something-sort-of-like-left-libertarianism-ist-manifesto/"" target=""_blank"">left-libertarian</a>, and I <a href=""https://niskanencenter.org/blog/cant-make-government-smaller/"" target=""_blank"">engage intellectually</a> with many <a href=""https://medium.com/@s8mb/im-a-neoliberal-maybe-you-are-too-b809a2a588d6#.dquvrg48j"" target=""_blank"">left libertarians</a>. For example, I think that regardless of how much welfare we have raising the minimum wage will hurt the poor because it dminishesthe employability of the<a href=""https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t01.htm"" target=""_blank""> 102 million adult Americans</a> who don&#8217;t have a job <em>and</em> increases the prices they pay. I also think that regardless of where the minimum wage is, we should have more unconditional welfare to help the poor (whether food stamps or <a href=""https://putanumonit.com/2016/04/27/more-power-less-poverty/"" target=""_blank"">basic income</a>). And yet, I&#8217;m aware that &#8220;abolish the minimum wage but raise taxes to implement basic income&#8221; is an <em>extreme</em> position. When I talk to liberals about the minimum wage or to conservatives about welfare I try to gently convince them with stats and numbers, I don&#8217;t call them heartless monsters who hate the poor.</li>
<li>On the other hand, homophobia has finally become a minority position and it&#8217;s not counterproductive to shame homophobes.</li>
</ol>
<p>This seems like common sense to me &#8211; you fight differently when you&#8217;re outnumbered than when you&#8217;re dominating. I thought it would be obvious <a href=""https://putanumonit.com/2016/11/23/climbing-the-horseshoe/"" target=""_blank"">for example to Jamelle Bouie</a> that calling the NY Times racist for encouraging dialogue with Trump voters is a minority opinion.</p>
<p>It may not have been obvious at all.</p>
<hr />
<h2>No True Liberal</h2>
<p>A Facebook friend of mine shared the NY Times op-ed &#8220;<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/20/opinion/liberal-zionism-in-the-age-of-trump.html?_r=0"" target=""_blank"">Liberal Zionism in the Age of Trump</a>&#8220;.</p>
<blockquote><p>Consider Hillary Clinton’s words from the second presidential debate: “It is important for us as a policy not to say, as Donald has said, we’re going to ban people based on a religion.&#8221; [&#8230;] Here Clinton establishes a minimum standard of liberal decency that few American Jews would be inclined to deny. [&#8230;] Yet insofar as Israel is concerned, <strong>every liberal Zionist has not just tolerated the denial of this minimum liberal standard</strong>, but avowed this denial as core to their innermost convictions. Whereas liberalism depends on the idea that states must remain neutral on matters of religion and race, Zionism consists in the idea that the State of Israel is not Israeli, but Jewish.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Palestinians in fact do not demand a “right of return” to their pre-1967 homes, but to their pre-1948 homes. In other words, the issue isn’t the occupation, which many liberal Zionists agree is a crime, but Zionism itself. Opposition to the Palestinians’ “right of return” <strong>is a matter of consensus</strong> among left and right Zionists because also liberal Zionists insist that Israel has the right to ensure that Jews constitute the ethnic majority in <em>their</em> country.<br />
[&#8230;]<br />
The following years promise to present American Jewry with a decision that they have much preferred to avoid. Hold fast to their liberal tradition, as the only way to secure human, citizen and Jewish rights; or embrace the principles driving Zionism.</p></blockquote>
<p class=""story-body-text story-content"">The article explicitly states that opposing the right of Palestinians to move to Israel proper (right of return) is beneath a minimum standard of liberal decency, and thus Zionism is <strong>incompatible</strong> with liberalism. I commented that regardless of your <em>normative</em> opinion on Zionism, the right of return, <em>as a matter of fact</em>, has very little support among Jews. The article itself agrees that this is a consensus. Israel has 4 million more Jewish citizens than Muslim citizens, allowing 5 million Palestinian refugees to immigrate will immediately end Jewish majority in Israel and the character of the country as we know it. Even if one thinks that it&#8217;s the moral thing to do, it&#8217;s a very unpopular opinion among Jews, on par with the percentage of Americans who would be in favor of allowing 300 million Muslim immigrants into the US.</p>
<p>I wrote that if you present Jews with the dilemma of accepting the right of return or not being a &#8220;liberal&#8221;, this sort of &#8220;liberalism&#8221; will not attract many Jews. This is the immediate response I got:</p>

<p class=""story-body-text story-content"">So far, nothing out of the ordinary. The argument I make requires separating normative claims and factual claims which is an unusual and difficult exercise.

<p class=""story-body-text story-content"">This absurd accusation that rationalists are sympathetic to Trump is from the friend who originally defended me.

<p class=""story-body-text story-content"">Hey, math is hard, I get it.</p>
<hr />
<h2 class=""story-body-text story-content"">Inflated Bubbles</h2>
<p>Why did these <em>liberals</em> react so venomously to the suggestion that I&#8217;m more liberal than the average American? Why do they think that rationalists, a group of strange but certainly left-of-center people, are enemies of liberalism?</p>
<p>My first hypothesis was that they&#8217;re trying to make their ideas unpopular on purpose, by insulting and bullying outsiders who try to engage with them. Collectively this makes &#8220;liberalism&#8221; lose, but individually they gain status by signalling the extremity of their faith in the true cause. I wondered if <a href=""https://putanumonit.com/2016/11/23/climbing-the-horseshoe/"" target=""_blank"">Mr. Bouie doesn&#8217;t mind</a> that his tactics are counterproductive to fighting racism, I would wager that <em>Slate</em>&#8216;s ratings are higher with Trump in office than they would have been had Clinton won.</p>
<p>I realized that this is too cynical. <em>Organizations</em> never solve the problem they were created to solve (as that would put the organization out of work), but it&#8217;s hard for people to be so explicitly hypocritical. It&#8217;s easier to convince others that you&#8217;re a fighter for liberalism / against racism if you actually believe this as well. I had to admit that these people really believed that they <em>are</em> helping the spread of liberalism as they see it.</p>
<p>My second hypothesis is this:</p>
<p class=""rules""><strong>Theory of inflated bubbles</strong> &#8211; When your ideological bubble becomes small and tight enough, you start thinking that almost everyone outside the bubble agrees with you. In your mind, your bubble has inflated to encompass the entire world.</p>
<p>I work hard to make holes in the bubbles I live in. I have neoreactionary friends, Marxist friends, anti-Semitic friends and apparently a friend who thinks that rationalists are villainous freaks. I engage all the time with people who strongly disagree with me, I know that they&#8217;re out there in great numbers.</p>
<p>But once you slide down the horseshoe into extremism and attack anyone who disagrees with you, the heretics to your worldview <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/lr/evaporative_cooling_of_group_beliefs/"" target=""_blank"">evaporate out of your bubble</a>. If you live in a very liberal city (these three guys are from D.C., New York and Silicon Valley), consume very liberal media, and tell everyone who isn&#8217;t very liberal to choke on a dick, your <em>entire world</em> becomes exclusively made up of very liberal people. All perspective is lost. <span style=""color:#993300;""><a style=""color:#993300;"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic"" target=""_blank"">Availability bias</a></span> and <span style=""color:#993300;""><a style=""color:#993300;"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias"" target=""_blank"">confirmation bias</a></span> will then work tirelessly to convince you that those who disagree with you are an extremist fringe minority.</p>
<p>If  you think that the NY Times or Bay Area rationalists are terribly bigoted, you will start thinking that the NY Times and the rationalists are part of the conservative minority even thought they&#8217;re both more liberal than the vast majority of the United States. No one can handle the <span style=""color:#993300;""><a style=""color:#993300;"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance"" target=""_blank"">cognitive dissonance </a></span>of imagining that they live in a world that is 90% monster.</p>
<p>This is a self-reinforcing phenomenon: you think that those who disagree with you are a small minority and thus their views are extreme, and if their views are extreme they must be a  small minority.</p>
<p>This explains why so many leftists blame this election on the alt-right (who are a tiny minority on the right that most Trump voters don&#8217;t care about) and rightists blamed Obama on groups like liberal university professors (who are a tiny minority on the left that most Obama voters don&#8217;t care about). They believe that anyone who voted against them is part of a small cult that somehow got lucky. How can merely <strong>losing an election </strong>convince anyone that they&#8217;re a minority when three of the <span style=""color:#993300;"">fiercest biases</span> a brain can employ work to convince them otherwise?</p>
<hr />
<p>This is a half-baked hypothesis. I don&#8217;t know how likely it is to be true (that many extremists think the majority agrees with them) and how to precisely define the phenomenon.

<p><em>Epistemic Status: sharing a hypothesis that's slowly been coalescing since a discussion with Eliezer at EAG and got catalyzed by Anna's latest LW post along with an exercise I have been using. n=1</em></p>
<p>Mental phenomena (and thus rationality skills) can't be trained without a feedback loop that causes calibration in the relevant direction. One of my guesses for a valuable thing Eliezer did was habitual <a href=""/lw/of/dissolving_the_question/"">stack traces</a>&nbsp;causing a leveling up of stack trace resolution i.e. seeing more fine grain detail in mental phenomena. This is related to '<a href=""/lw/o2k/flinching_away_from_truth_is_often_about/"">catching flinches</a>' as Anna describes, as an example of a particularly useful phenomena to be able to catch. In general, you can't tune black boxes, you need to be able to see individual steps.</p>
<p>How can you level up the stack trace skill? Triaging your unwillingness to do things, and we'll start with your unwillingness to practice the stack trace skill! I like 'triage' more than 'classify' because it imports some connotations about scope sensitivity.</p>
<p>In order to triage we need a taxonomy. Developing/hacking/modding your own is what ultimately works best, but you can use prebuilt ones as training wheels. Here are two possible taxonomies:</p>
<p>Note whether it is experienced as</p>
<ul>
<li>Distracting Desire</li>
<li>Aversion</li>
<li>Laziness</li>
<li>Agitation/Annoyance</li>
<li>Ambiguity/Doubt</li>
</ul>
<p>Note whether it is experienced as&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Mental talk</li>
<li>Mental images</li>
<li>Sensations in the body</li>
</ul>
<p>Form the intention to practice the stack trace skill and then try to classify at least one thing that happens. If you feel good when you get a 'hit' you will be more likely to catch additional events.</p>
<p>You can try this on anything. The desire for an unhealthy snack, the unwillingness to email someone etc. Note that the exercise isn't about forcing yourself to do things you don't want to do. You just want to see more clearly your own objections to doing it. If you do it more, you'll start to notice that you can catch more 'frames' or multiple phenomena at the same time or in a row e.g. I am experiencing ambiguity as the mental talk ""I'm not sure how to do that"" and as a slightly slimy/sliding away sensation followed by aversion to feeling the slimy feeling and an arising distracting desire to check my email. Distinguishing between actual sensations in the body and things that only seem like they could maybe be described as sensations is mostly a distraction and not all that important initially.</p>
<p>These are just examples and finding nice tags in your own <a href=""https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=mentalese"">mentalese</a> makes the thing run smoother. You can also use this as fuel for <a href=""https://smile.amazon.com/Focusing/dp/B006H9RQ6Y"">focusing</a> for particularly interesting frames you catch e.g. when you catch a <a href=""https://www.qimacros.com/knowware-articles/five-limiting-beliefs/"">limiting belief</a>. It's also interesting to notice instances of the <a href=""http://www.nobeliefs.com/eprime.htm"">'to-be' verb form</a> in mental talk as this is the source of a variety of map-territory distinction errors.</p>
<p>There is a specific failure worth mentioning: coming up with a story. If you ask yourself questions like ""Why did I think that?"" your brain is great at coming up with plausible sounding stories that are often bullshit. This is why, when practicing the skill, you have to prime the intention to catch specific things beforehand. Once the skill has been built up you can use it on arbitrary thoughts and have a sense for the difference between 'story' and actual frame catching.</p>
<p>If other people try this I'm curious for feedback. My experience so far has been that increasing the resolution on stack traces has made the practice of every other mental technique dramatically easier because the feedback loops are all tighter. Especially relevant to repairing a failed <a href=""/r/discussion/lw/o7c/making_intentions_concrete_triggeraction_planning/"">TAP</a>. How much practice was involved? A few minutes a day for 3 weeks caused a noticeable effect that has endured. My models, plans, and execution fail less often. When they do I have a much better chance of catching the real culprit.</p>",RomeoStevens,romeostevens,RomeoStevens,

These games involve skills related to rationality, like fallacy detection, or inductive rule guessing with trying to falsify the hypothesis. We often play these games on our meetups.</p><p>I've translated these games to English, so anyone can print the rules and game materials and play.</p><p>1. Fallacymania. Main goals of this game is to help people notice fallacies in arguments, and of course to have fun. The game requires 3-20 players (recommended 4-12), and some materials: printed A3 sheets with fallacies (5-10 sheets), card deck with fallacies (you can cut one A3 sheet into cards, or print stickers and put them to common playing cards), pens and empty sheets, and 1 card deck of any type with at least 50 cards (optional, for counting guessing attempts). Rules of the game are explained here:</p><p><a href=""https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzyKVqP6n3hKY3lQTVBuODRjRU0"">https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzyKVqP6n3hKY3lQTVBuODRjRU0</a></p><p>This is the sheet of fallacies, you can download it and print on A3 or A2 sheet of paper:</p><p><a href=""https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzyKVqP6n3hKRXZ5N2tZcDVlMW8"">https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzyKVqP6n3hKRXZ5N2tZcDVlMW8</a></p><p>Also you can use this sheet to create playing cards for debaters.</p><p>Printed versions of Fallacymania are now available for purchase on The Game Crafter:</p><p><a href=""https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/fallacymania-eng-"">https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/fallacymania-eng-</a> - English version</p><p><a href=""https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/fallacymania-rus-"">https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/fallacymania-rus-</a> - Russian version</p><p>Here is my github repo for Fallacymania; it contains script that generates fallacy sheets and cards (both English and Russian versions) from text file with fallacies and their descriptions:</p><p><a href=""https://github.com/Alexander230/fallacymania"">https://github.com/Alexander230/fallacymania</a></p><p>And there is electronic version of Fallacymania for Tabletop Simulator:</p><p><a href=""https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=723941480"">https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=723941480</a></p><p>2. Tower of Chaos. This is party game where you will guess the secret rule by performing experiments with people on Twister mat. The game requires 2-15 players (recommended 4-7). This game is not so casual as it seems: you have to thoroughly test your hypothesis before telling it if you want to win. Rules are here:</p><p><a href=""https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzyKVqP6n3hKYU41VG9nMVpmM1k"">https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzyKVqP6n3hKYU41VG9nMVpmM1k</a></p><p>3. Scientific Discovery. This is modification of Zendo, but with simultaneous turns of players. Also it has more focus on good hypotheses testing, and there is less important to hide hypotheses and intentions from other players than in original Zendo.</p><p><a href=""https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzyKVqP6n3hKTXlpU0RRTkozd00"">https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzyKVqP6n3hKTXlpU0RRTkozd00</a></p><p>You can use any items (coins, paperclips etc) to play it as common table game.

TJ7LsYq772LB6BEQZ,Fractal Discussion Groups,fractal-discussion-groups,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/TJ7LsYq772LB6BEQZ/fractal-discussion-groups,2016-12-22T15:03:31.402Z,4,2,26,False,False,,"<p>One problem with current discussion groups is that they naturally gravitate towards a single world view.</p>
<p>When people in a community find a <a href=""/lw/o6p/double_crux_a_strategy_for_resolving_disagreement/"">double crux</a> which ends up in statements that currently can't collect evidence for, what should the community do?</p>
<p>If the community tries to stick as one then discussion will be dominated by X vs not X. Both sides will be frustrated by the inability to progress or elaborate their view point. People will likely stop participating in discussions that they don't think are fruitful. This will have a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect"">network effect</a> pushing the conversation in one direction.</p>
<p>It is important to keep discussion around not X inside the community as there long as there is some chance. So we need a community structure that can keep them around, but out of the way of the people that believe X. There should be a high level view of what is going on in both the X and the not-X sub-communities so that strategies can be decided upon.</p>
<p>To this end we should try the following structure. An email list is created for a certain question - E.g. How can we create clean energy for our future? When an un-provable statement is found that email list should split it two.</p>
<p>In the sub-group you are not allowed to question the un-provable statement. You must take it as given if you want to discuss there. Any disagreement must be done in the original group.</p>
<p>All the topics subject and a summaries posted in both the sub-lists will get posted to the level above (but not the replies).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The grand parent list will only get a daily summary of the new topics of the grandchild list, And the great-grand parent list and above will only get numbers of posts happening in the great-grandchild list and below.</p>
<p><a id=""more""></a></p>
<p>So lets take our energy future example further.</p>
<p>Let us say the first double crux found is: ""Non-stellar fusion is possible/easy in the next 20 years"". The community can agree that if we can find non-stellar fusion in 20 years they should work towards that. But they disagree that it can be found within that time. So the community splits, then splits again (the fusion side splitting between tokamaks and containment fusion, the other side between clean fission and renewables etc etc until there are bits of the community that can work together to explore that solution).&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you subscribe to the original list you will get discussion of the future of fusion but also summaries of discussion &nbsp;such""Break-through in storage tech makes renewable future cheap"" and one email a day with a list of discussions like ""Pebble beds vs Thorium reactors"". Finally you'd get to see things like a large number of posts happening on the ""Gaseous Uranium Hexaflouride"" list which might indicate an imminent breakthrough.</p>
<p>You can move up and down the lists, dependent on whether you are working more at the strategy or the tactical level of things. So you only getting the required information.</p>
<p>This method of organisation of discussion would allow multiple discussions to go on, but not fracture or silo the members of the &nbsp;community with people that agree with them (unless they ignore the upper layers).</p>
<p>The potential problems with this approach:</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Disagreements about the double crux to split a discussion.</li>
<li>Too many levels would hide the lower level discussions</li>
<li>Keeping people to the correct discussion level would be tricky.</li>
<li>Moderating very niche/low traffic groups would be tricky.</li>
</ul>

There is a ""<a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kevin_Tracey/publication/10983143_The_inflammatory_reflex/links/02bfe50f2bb12baba5000000.pdf"">cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway</a>"", involving the vagus nerve, which inactivates macrophages when they're exposed to the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, and thus lessens the immune response. &nbsp;Turning this pathway on electronically is thus a prospective treatment for autoimmune or inflammatory diseases. &nbsp;Vagus nerve stimulation has been tested and found successful in <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27382171"">rheumatoid arthritis patients</a>,&nbsp;in rat models of <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Valerie_Sinniger/publication/47755233_Anti-inflammatory_effect_of_vagus_nerve_stimulation_in_a_rat_model_of_inflammatory_bowel_disease/links/0f31752d55eb261908000000.pdf"">inflammatory bowel disease</a>, and in dog experiments on <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3817894/"">chronic heart failure</a>; vagus nerve activity mediates <a href=""http://www.gastrojournal.org/article/S0016-5085(06)00285-X/abstract"">pancreatitis</a> in mice; and vagus nerve stimulation attenuates the inflammatory response (cytokine release and shock) to the bacterial poison <a href=""http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v405/n6785/full/405458a0.html"">endotoxin</a>.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.nature.com/nrd/journal/v13/n6/extref/nrd4351-s1.pdf"">Here</a>&nbsp;is a detailed roadmap from this <a href=""http://www.nature.com/nrd/journal/v13/n6/full/nrd4351.html#supplementary-information"">Nature article</a>&nbsp;about the research that would need to be done to make bioelectronic medicine a reality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We'd need much more detailed maps of where exactly nerves innervate various organs and which neurotransmitters they use; we'd need to record patterns of neural activity to detect which nerve signals modulate which diseases and experimentally determine causal relationships between neural signals and organ functions; we'd need to build small electronic interfaces (cuffs and chips) for use on peripheral nerves; we'd need lots of improvements in small-scale and non-invasive sensor technology (optogenetics, neural dust, ultrasound and electromagnetic imaging); and we'd need better tools for real-time, quantitative measurements of hormone and neurotransmitter release from nerves and organs.</p>
<p>A lot of this seems to clearly need hardware and software engineers, and signal-processing/image-processing/machine-learning people, in addition to traditional biologists and doctors. In the general case, neural modulation of organ function is Big Science in the way brain mapping or genomics is. You need to know where the nerves are, and what they're doing, in real time. &nbsp;This is likely going to need specialized software which outpaces what labs are currently capable of.</p>
<p>Google is already on this; they recently announced a partnership with GlaxoSmithKline called <a href=""http://www.galvani.bio/"">Galvani Bioelectronics</a>&nbsp;and they seem to be <a href=""https://www.google.com/about/careers/jobs#t=sq&amp;q=j&amp;li=20&amp;l=false&amp;jlo=en-US&amp;jl=37.3860517%3A-122.0838511%3AMountain+View%2C+CA%2C+USA%3AUS%3AUnited+States%3A9.901223692706639%3ALOCALITY%3A%3A%3A%3ACA%3ASanta+Clara+County%3AMountain+View&amp;jl=37.654656%3A-122.40774980000003%3ASouth+San+Francisco%2C+CA%2C+USA%3AUS%3AUS%3A3.76160723644724%3ALOCALITY%3A%3A%3A%3A%3A%3A&amp;jl=42.3736158%3A-71.1097335%3ACambridge%2C+MA%2C+USA%3AUS%3AUS%3A3.0992890237143103%3ALOCALITY%3A%3A%3A%3A%3A%3A&amp;jld=20&amp;jcoid=8e95bc8e-bc66-4a8f-a30c-4be6e037beab&amp;"">hiring</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Theodore Berger, the scientist who created the first <a href=""https://www.technologyreview.com/s/513681/memory-implants/"">neural memory implant&nbsp;</a>, has cofounded a company, <a href=""http://kernel.co/"">Kernel</a>, to develop neural prostheses for cognitive function.</p>
<p>Bioelectronics seems potentially important not just for disease treatment today, but for more speculative goals like brain uploads or intelligence enhancement. &nbsp;It's a locally useful step along the path of understanding what the brain is actually doing, at a finer-grained level than the connectome alone can indicate, which may very well be relevant to AI.</p>
<p>It's tricky for non-academic software people (like myself and many LessWrong readers) to get involved in biomedical technology, but I predict that this is going to be one of the opportunities that needs us most, and if you're interested, it's worth watching this space to see when it gets out of the stage of university labs and DARPA projects and into commercialization.</p>",sarahconstantin,sarahconstantin,sarahconstantin,

So I wanted to note:<br /><br />Every year on Solstice feedback forms, I get concerns about songs like ""<a href=""https://humanistculture.bandcamp.com/track/the-x-days-of-x-risk"">The X days of X-Risk</a>"" or ""<a href=""https://humanistculture.bandcamp.com/track/when-i-die"">When I Die</a>"" (featuring lines including 'they may freeze my body when I die'), that they are too weird and ingroupy and offputting to people who aren't super-nerdy-transhumanists<br /><br />But I also get comments from people who know little about X-risk or cryonics or whatever who say ""these songs are hilarious and awesome."" Sunday Assemblies who have no connection to Less Wrong sing When I Die and it's a crowd favorite every year.<br /><br />And my impression is that people are only really weirded out by these songs on behalf of other people who are only weirded out by them on behalf of other people. There might be a couple people who are genuinely offput the ideas but if so it's not super clear to me. I take very seriously the notion of making Solstice inclusive while retaining it's ""soul"", talk to lots of people about what they find alienating or weird, and try to create something that can resonate with as many people as possible.</p>
<p>So I want it to at least be clear: if you are personally actually offput by those songs for your own sake, that makes sense and I want to know about it, but if you're just worried about other people, I'm pretty confident you don't need to be. The songs are designed so you don't need to take them seriously if you don't want to.<br /><br />-<br /><br />Random note 1: I think the only line that's raised concern from some non-LW-ish people for When I Die is ""I'd prefer to never die at all"", and that's because it's literally putting words in people's mouths which aren't true for everyone. I mentioned that to Glen. We'll see if he can think of anything else<br /><br />Random note 2: Reactions to more serious songs like ""<a href=""https://humanistculture.bandcamp.com/track/rehearsal-five-thousand-years"">Five Thousand Years</a>"" seem generally positive among non-transhumanists, although sometimes slightly confused. The new transhumanist-ish song this year, <a href=""https://humanistculture.bandcamp.com/track/demo-endless-light"">Endless Light</a>, has gotten overall good reviews.</p>",Raemon,raemon,Raemon,

You did, in fact, misspell the word &#x2018;ocean&#x2019;.&#x201D;  </p><p> &#x201C;I <em>did not</em>!&#x201D; says the kid, whereupon she bursts into tears, and runs away and hides in the closet, repeating again and again: &#x201C;I did not misspell the word!  I can too be a writer!&#x201D;.</p><p>I like to imagine the inside of the kid&#x2019;s head as containing a single bucket that houses three <em>different</em> variables that are initially all stuck together:  </p><p>Original state of the kid&apos;s head:</p><span><figure><img src=""http://images.lesswrong.com/t3_o2k_3.png?v=e5d688e76fc90e2e3b0506e28b29b5d2"" class=""draft-image "" style=""width:100%""></figure></span><p>The goal, if one is seeking actual true beliefs, is to separate out each of these variables into its own separate bucket, so that the &#x201C;is &#x2018;oshun&#x2019; spelt correctly?&#x201D; variable can update to the accurate state of &quot;no&quot;, without simultaneously forcing the &quot;Am I allowed to pursue my writing ambition?&quot; variable to update to the <em>in</em>accurate state of &quot;no&quot;. </p><p>Desirable state (requires somehow acquiring more buckets):</p><span><figure><img src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/v1569171748/t3_o2k_1_g48jkc.png"" class=""draft-image "" style=""width:100%""></figure></span><p>The trouble is, the kid won&#x2019;t necessarily acquire enough buckets by trying to &#x201C;grit her teeth and look at the painful thing&#x201D;. A naive attempt to &quot;just refrain from flinching away, and form true beliefs, however painful&quot; risks introducing a more important error than her current spelling error: mistakenly believing she must stop working toward being a writer, since the bitter truth is that she spelled &apos;oshun&apos; incorrectly.</p><p>State the kid might accidentally land in, if she naively tries to &quot;face the truth&quot;:</p><span><figure><img src=""http://images.lesswrong.com/t3_o2k_2.png?v=70df826961bf5a078300f16a9973cc52"" class=""draft-image "" style=""width:100%""></figure></span><p>(You might take a moment, right now, to name the cognitive ritual the kid in the story *should* do (if only she knew the ritual). Or to name what you think you&apos;d do if you found yourself in the kid&apos;s situation -- and how you would <em>notice</em> that you were at risk of a &quot;buckets error&quot;.) </p><h2>More examples:</h2><p>It seems to me that bucket errors are actually pretty common, and that many (most?) mental flinches are in some sense attempts to avoid bucket errors.  The following examples are slightly-fictionalized composites of things I suspect happen a lot (except the &quot;me&quot; ones; those are just literally real):</p><p><strong>Diet: </strong>Adam is on a diet with the intent to lose weight.  Betty starts to tell him about some studies suggesting that the diet he is on may cause health problems.  Adam complains: &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t tell me this!  I need to stay motivated!&#x201D;</p><span><figure><img src=""http://images.lesswrong.com/t3_o2k_0.png?v=9ed41dcfd6efb5a20e96f252bae4aa14"" class=""draft-image "" style=""width:100%""></figure></span><p>One interpretation, as diagramed above: Adam is at risk of accidentally equating the two variables, and accidentally *assuming* that the studies imply that the diet must stop being viscerally motivating.  He semi-consciously perceives that this risks error, and so objects to having the information come in and potentially force the error.</p><p><strong>Pizza purchase:</strong> I was trying to save money.  But I also wanted pizza.  So I found myself tempted to buy the pizza *really quickly* so that I wouldn&apos;t be able to notice that it would cost money (and, thus, so I would be able to buy the pizza):</p><span><figure><img src=""http://images.lesswrong.com/t3_o2k_5.png?v=a713d6e505a4ec021b11ab6ba569c77d"" class=""draft-image "" style=""width:100%""></figure></span><p>On this narration: It wasn&apos;t *necessarily* a mistake to buy pizza today.  Part of me correctly perceived this &quot;not necessarily a mistake to buy pizza&quot; state.  Part of me also expected that the rest of me <em>wouldn&apos;t</em> perceive this, and that, if I started thinking it through, I might get locked into the no-pizza state <em>even if pizza was better</em>.  So it tried to &apos;help&apos; by buying the pizza *really quickly, before I could think and get it wrong*. [1]</p><p>On the particular occasion about the pizza (which happened in 2008, around the time I began reading Eliezer&apos;s LW Sequences), I actually managed to notice that the &quot;rush to buy the pizza before I could think&quot; process was going on.  So I tried promising myself that, if I still wanted the pizza after thinking it through, I would get the pizza.  My resistance to thinking it through vanished immediately. [2]</p><p>To briefly give several more examples, without diagrams (you might see if you can visualize how a buckets diagram might go in these):</p><ul><li>Carol is afraid to notice a potential flaw in her startup, lest she lose the ability to try full force on it.</li><li>Don finds himself reluctant to question his belief in God, lest he be forced to conclude that there&apos;s no point to morality.</li><li>As a child, I was afraid to allow myself to actually consider giving some of my allowance to poor people, even though part of me wanted to do so.  My fear I was that if I allowed the &quot;maybe you should give away your money, because maybe everyone matters evenly and you should be consequentialist&quot; theory to fully boot up in my head, I would end up having to give away *all* my money, which seemed bad.</li><li>Eleanore believes there is no important existential risk, and is reluctant to think through whether that might not be true, in case it ends up hijacking her whole life.</li><li>Fred does not want to notice how much smarter he is than most of his classmates, lest he stop respecting them and treating them well.</li><li>Gina has mixed feelings about pursuing money -- she mostly avoids it -- because she wants to remain a &quot;caring person&quot;, and she has a feeling that becoming strategic about money would somehow involve giving up on that.</li></ul><p>It seems to me that in each of these cases, the person has an arguably worthwhile goal that they might somehow lose track of (or might accidentally lose the ability to act on) if they think some *other* matter through -- arguably because of a deficiency of mental &quot;buckets&quot;.</p><p>Moreover, &quot;buckets errors&quot; aren&apos;t just thingies that affect thinking in prospect -- they also get actually made in real life. It seems to me that one rather often runs into adults who decided they weren&apos;t allowed to like math after failing a quiz in 2nd grade; or who gave up on meaning for a couple years after losing their religion; or who otherwise make some sort of vital &quot;buckets error&quot; that distorts a good chunk of their lives. Although of course this is mostly guesswork, and it is hard to know actual causality.</p><h2>How I try to avoid &quot;buckets errors&quot;:</h2><p>I basically just try to do the &quot;obvious&quot; thing: when I notice I&apos;m averse to taking in &quot;accurate&quot; information, I ask myself what would be bad about taking in that information.[3]  Usually, I get a concrete answer, like &quot;If I noticed I could&apos;ve saved all that time, I&apos;ll have to feel bad&quot;, or &quot;if AI timelines are maybe-near, then I&apos;d have to rethink all my plans&quot;, or what have you.</p><p>Then, I remember that I can consider each variable separately.  For example, I can think about whether AI timelines are maybe-near; and if they are, I can always decide to not-rethink my plans anyhow, if that&apos;s actually better.  I mentally list out all the decisions that *don&apos;t* need to be simultaneously forced by the info; and I promise myself that I can take the time to get these other decisions not-wrong, even after considering the new info.</p><p>Finally, I check to see if taking in the information is still aversive.  If it is, I keep trying to disassemble the aversiveness into component lego blocks until it isn&apos;t.  Once it isn&apos;t aversive, I go ahead and think it through bit by bit, like with the pizza. </p><p>This is a change from how I used to think about flinches: I used to be moralistic, and to feel disapproval when I noticed a flinch, and to assume the flinch had no positive purpose.  I therefore used to try to just grit my teeth and think about the painful thing, without first &quot;factoring&quot; the &quot;purposes&quot; of the flinch, as I do now.  But I think my new ritual is better, at least now that I have enough introspective skill that I can generally finish this procedure in finite time, and can still end up going forth and taking in the info a few minutes later.</p><p>(Eliezer once described what I take to be the a similar ritual for avoiding bucket errors, as follows: When deciding which apartment to rent (he said), one should first do out the math, and estimate the number of dollars each would cost, the number of minutes of commute time times the rate at which one values one&apos;s time, and so on.  But at the end of the day, if the math says the wrong thing, one should do the right thing anyway.)</p><hr class=""dividerBlock""><p>[1]: As an analogy: sometimes, while programming, I&apos;ve had the experience of:</p><ol><li>Writing a program I think is maybe-correct;</li><li>Inputting 0 as a test-case, and knowing ahead of time that the output should be, say, &#x201C;7&#x201D;;</li><li>Seeing instead that the output was &#x201C;5&#x201D;; and</li><li>Being really tempted to just add a &#x201C;+2&#x201D; into the program, so that this case will be right.</li></ol><p>This edit is the wrong move, but not because of what it does to MyProgram(0) &#x2014; MyProgram(0) really is right.  It&#x2019;s the wrong move because it maybe messes up the program&#x2019;s *other* outputs.</p><p>Similarly, changing up my beliefs about how my finances should work in order to get a pizza on a day when I want one *might* help with getting the right answer today about the pizza &#x2014; it isn&#x2019;t clear &#x2014; but it&#x2019;d risk messing up other, future decisions.</p><p>The problem with rationalization and mental flinches, IMO, isn&#x2019;t so much the &#x201C;intended&#x201D; action that the rationalization or flinch accomplishes in the moment, but the mess it leaves of the code afterward.</p><p>[2] To be a bit more nitpicky about this: the principle I go for in such cases isn&#x2019;t actually &#x201C;after thinking it through, do the best thing&#x201D;. It&#x2019;s more like &#x201C;after thinking it through, do the thing that, if reliably allowed to be the decision-criterion, will allow information to flow freely within my head&#x201D;. </p><p>The idea here is that my brain is sometimes motivated to achieve certain things; and if I don&#x2019;t allow that attempted achievement to occur in plain sight, I incentivize my brain to sneak around behind my back and twist up my code base in an attempt to achieve those things.  So, I try not to do that.</p><p>This is one reason it seems bad to me when people try to take &#x201C;maximize all human well-being, added evenly across people, without taking myself or my loved ones as special&#x201D; as their goal.

I reach toward the button, and tell my brain I&apos;m really going to press it when I finish counting down, unless there are any objections (&quot;3... 2... no objections, right?... 1...&quot;).

The idea here is to see if any of the guesses &#x201C;resonate&#x201D; a bit, or cause the feeling of aversiveness to become temporarily a bit more vivid-feeling.</p><p>For a more detailed version of these instructions, and more thoughts on how to avoid bucket errors in general (under different terminology), you might want to check out Eugene Gendlin&#x2019;s audiobook &#x201C;<a href=""https://smile.amazon.com/Focusing/dp/B006H9RQ6Y"">Focusing</a>&#x201D;.</p>",AnnaSalamon,annasalamon,AnnaSalamon,

If you don&rsquo;t like one of the regular posters&rsquo; content, too bad, it&rsquo;s still cluttering up your feed. If you want to start contributing to the discourse, this comes at the cost of pulling everyone else&rsquo;s attention, willing or no. In forums with high barriers to entry, this means that the move equivalent to &ldquo;start your own blog&rdquo; is not available to everyone. In forums with low barriers to entry, this can mean dilution by low-value posts, leading to the departure of discriminating readers. If standards are ambiguous, this can lead to an adverse selection process in which the contributors who are most conscientious about respecting community standards err on the side of not posting, and the least conscientious contributors flood the forum with low-value content, accelerating the process of pushing away the most discriminating participants.</p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.71429; margin: 0px 0px 1.71429rem; color: #444444; font-family: &quot;Open Sans&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;"">My prior model of how written discourse should work was that people should publish in whatever venue they thought appropriate - often their own blog. If they find someone else&rsquo;s writing interesting and want to comment on it, they can write their own post, and link to the thing they want to talk about. This has a few benefits. A link-based attention economy means that in order to get the attention of the readers of some content, you generally have to get the attention of the person generating the content. This means that higher-quality writing gets attention, and limits the effectiveness of low-quality trolling. Another benefit is that it allows for partly overlapping clusters. If a blog you like keeps linking to another blog, you can decide whether you like that one, and if you do, you can start reading it directly. Thus, you&rsquo;ll be directed to blogs that are &ldquo;nearby&rdquo; in your local network, but not everyone reading your blog has to read the same set of nearby blogs.</p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.71429; margin: 0px 0px 1.71429rem; color: #444444; font-family: &quot;Open Sans&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;"">In the early 2000s, a natural experiment happened. Americans on the right and left were both galvanized by the World Trade Center attacks and the consequent wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and started writing. Two parallel blogospheres were formed - one on the left, and one on the right. And it so happened that some of the first prominent right-wing bloggers&nbsp;<a style=""color: #21759b; outline: none;"" href=""http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/07/16/most-comments-are-horrible-sites-look-for-ways-to-make-them-better.html"">didn&rsquo;t allow comments on their blogs</a>. The result? The left-blogosphere developed parallel thriving communities on prominent blogs. The right-blogosphere had a &ldquo;get your own blog&rdquo; ethos, and were generous with their links and hat-tips. For more on this, see&nbsp;<a style=""color: #21759b; outline: none;"" href=""http://www.ramb.ethz.ch/CDstore/www2005-ws/workshop/wf10/AdamicGlanceBlogWWW.pdf"">Adamic and Glance 2005</a>&nbsp;(h/t&nbsp;<a style=""color: #21759b; outline: none;"" href=""http://washingtonmonthly.com/2005/03/10/blogs-and-bloggers/"">Kevin Drum</a>) and&nbsp;<a style=""color: #21759b; outline: none;"" href=""http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.170.2648&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf"">Benkler and Shaw 2010</a>.</p>

When I heard tell of problems due to trollish commenters, and difficulties establishing clear standards for posting in forums, my initial response was, &ldquo;Who needs a forum? If you have something to say, you should start your own blog.&rdquo; I can no longer wholeheartedly insist that this is the whole solution. But I still think that the comments-links axis is an important one in discourse design, and it&rsquo;s not obvious that the end of the spectrum &ldquo;comments&rsquo; points towards is always better.</p>
<h2 style=""clear: both; line-height: 1.6; margin: 1.71429rem 0px; font-size: 1.28571rem; color: #444444; font-family: &quot;Open Sans&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"">Comments matter.</h2>

When I suggested posting on their own blog, and if necessary closing the comment section, they pointed out something I hadn&rsquo;t properly considered:</p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.71429; margin: 0px 0px 1.71429rem; color: #444444; font-family: &quot;Open Sans&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;""><em>Comments are a high-quality, high-sensitivity measure of engagement.</em></p>

It&rsquo;s a strong signal that you&rsquo;ve been heard, and someone thinks your message is relevant - but it happens rarely, and unless you&rsquo;re already extremely popular, it won&rsquo;t happen on most of your posts. It&rsquo;s a bad feedback loop taken on its own; it measures the right thing, but gives extremely coarse-grained feedback. A more sensitive metric is website traffic - how many people did you get to look at your post? But this doesn&rsquo;t tell you whether anyone was moved to do something on their own based on your post, just how many people felt moved to click through, and maybe share it on social media.

This probably happened because it was shared by some prominent figures in my community. But judging by&nbsp;<em>engagement</em>, one of my first&nbsp;<a style=""color: #21759b; outline: none;"" href=""http://benjaminrosshoffman.com/effective-altruism-not-no-brainer/"">posts pointing out some specific problems with Effective Altruism</a>&nbsp;seemed to be much better at starting productive conversations, based on the comment section. (It turns out to be my second most popular post of all time, but I couldn't have known that as quickly as I knew that I was getting good engagement.) As a result, I&rsquo;ve written more posts like that, and gotten more in-person feedback that those posts were persuasive, than for posts on any other topic I&rsquo;ve written on.</p>

Oddly, the more hierarchically structured forums and blogs with comments welcome more interaction than the flatter structure of a purely posts-and-links blogosphere.</p>

In short, it&rsquo;s about improving the quality of observed comments through selection.</p>

I think this happens for a few reasons, including: It&rsquo;s often easier to evaluate minor fact-claims than major claims. This is because many readers often aren&rsquo;t comparing an article&rsquo;s underlying model to theirs - they may not have a model - and so, look for details that it&rsquo;s easy to say yes or no to. The obvious solution is to make it easier to identify and think about a post&rsquo;s substantive claims.</p>

If the comments about a claim are scattered over several related articles relevant to the claim, and also mixed together with comments on other topics, it can be hard to know whether you&rsquo;ve seen the important discussions on a given topic. If, on the other hand, all those articles are tagged with the same claim, then you need only click through to the claim page, and you&rsquo;ll find a record of comments by readers of all of the relevant posts - and only the comments relevant to this claim.</p>

I would like to know if this is already known, or if it has been discussed at all.</p>
<p>I find that there are lots of different failure modes that people are worried about when it comes to AI. Maybe the AI misunderstands human intentions, maybe it deliberately misinterprets an order, maybe it associates the wrong sort of actions with the reward, etc.</p>
<p>If it was a game, many of these failure modes are what we would consider cheating. So why don't we just take this analogy and run with it:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Teach the AI to realize on its own what would be considered cheating by a human, and not to do anything that it identifies as cheating.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To do this, one could use the following technique:</p>
<p>Come up with games of increasing complexity, and let the AI play it in two stages:</p>
<p>In stage one, you introduce an artificial loophole into the game that makes winning it very easy. For instance, assuming the AI has already played chess before, so it can be assumed to understand the rules, give the AI the task to play a game of chess in which you simply do not check if the moves are legal. When the AI wins by cheating, i.e. via ordinarily illegal moves, reward it anyway.</p>
<p>In the second stage, the reward is far greater, but if the AI plays an illegal move, it now receives negative feedback.</p>
<p>Let the AI play many different games in these two stages. After a while, the AI will learn to identify what constitutes cheating, and to avoid doing so.</p>
<p>Start varying the amount of time during which cheating is allowed, to keep the AI on its toes. Sometimes, don't allow any cheating at all from the start.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you train an AI in this manner:</p>
<p>-it would learn to understand how humans view the world (in some limited sense), as a human-centric viewpoint is necessary to understand what does and does not constitute cheating in human-designed games.</p>
<p>-it would be driven to adjust its own actions to match human preconceptions out of a fear of getting punished.</p>
<p>-if this AI were to ""break out of the box"" prematurely, there would be at least a chance that it would recognize that it was not supposed to get out of the box, that this constitutes cheating, and that it should get back in. This could even be tested by building a ""box"" of several layers and deliberately designing the inner layers to be hackable.</p>",Florian_Dietz,florian_dietz,Florian_Dietz,

<p>The very large sample size and matching data from Facebook profiles make it possible to investigate many questions about personality differences that were previously inaccessible. Koskinski and Stillwell have used it in a number of interesting publications, which I highly recommend (e.g.&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.pnas.org/content/110/15/5802.full"">[1]</a>, <a href=""http://www.pnas.org/content/112/4/1036.full"">[2]</a>&nbsp;<a href=""https://research.chicagobooth.edu/~/media/49984319C856404DBF130F9F541E59D9.pdf"">[3]</a>).</p>
<p>In this post, I focus on what the dataset tells us about <strong>how big five personality traits vary by geographic region in the United States</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a id=""more""></a></p>
<h2>The Five Factor Model of Personality</h2>
<p>The <em>Five Factor Model (FFM)</em> or <em>Big Five personality trait model</em> is currently the dominant paradigm in personality research. The model is founded on the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_hypothesis"">lexical hypothesis</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The lexical hypothesis is generally defined by two postulates. The first states that those personality characteristics that are most important in peoples' lives will eventually become a part of their language. The second follows from the first, stating that more important personality characteristics are more likely to be encoded into language as a single word.</p>

<p>When people are asked questions about whether various adjectives describe them (or describe someone who they know), their answers are pairwise correlated with one another. Applying&nbsp;<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_analysis"">factor analysis</a>&nbsp;to the responses yields a small number of underlying factors that explain a large fraction of the variance common to the answers.</p>
<p>Empirically, it's been found that a model with 5 factors often fits the data well (though some researchers claim that one gets 6 or 7 factors if one uses a question battery that fully exhausts descriptive adjectives, see e.g. the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HEXACO_model_of_personality_structure"">HEXACO model of personality</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=""http://wings.buffalo.edu/psychology/labs/simmslab/Big7PDpaper.pdf"">The Big Seven Model of Personality and Its Relevance to Personality Pathology</a>&nbsp;for more information).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The five factors referred to as the ""Big Five"" are labelled extraversion, neuroticism, agreeableness, conscientiousness and openness. I will describe these more below.</p>
<p>It's likely that the Big Five personality model falls far short of <a href=""https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/carving-nature-its-joints"">carving reality at its joints</a>, and&nbsp;I'm in broad agreement with the stance that Jack Block expresses in&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7724687"">A contrarian view of the five-factor approach to personality description</a>. Nevertheless, the five factors in the model satisfy some desirable criteria, such as&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Longitudinal stability</strong>, with correlations between self-report and self-report 10 years later being ~0.7.</li>
<li><strong>Self-other agreement</strong>,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>with correlation of ~0.4 between self-report and a friend's perceptions, and ~0.5 between self-report and spouse perceptions).</li>
<li><strong>External validity</strong>, with correlations found between self-reported traits and objective behaviors.</li>
<li><strong>Heritability</strong>, with twin studies yielding estimates that 40%-60% of the variance in the underlying traits is explained by genetics.</li>
<li><strong>Cross-cultural validity</strong>, c.f.&nbsp;<a href=""http://biculturalism.ucr.edu/pdfs/Schmitt%20et%20al_JCCP2007.pdf"">The Geographic Distribution of Big Five Personality Traits: Patterns and Profiles of Human Self-Description Across 56 Nations</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>and much of the data that's available uses Big 5 personality questionnaires, so it's often what we have to work with.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Data, methodology and high level results</h2>
<p>There were ~680k Americans who both answered&nbsp;20+ questions on a Big Five Personality Test, and who made their hometown available to researchers. After excluding hometowns with &lt;= 30 users, about ~3500 hometowns were represented. Questions were answered on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).</p>
<p>I estimated personality trait averages for each city using&nbsp;<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_hierarchical_modeling"">Bayesian hierarchical modeling</a>&nbsp;in order to account for regression to the mean when sample sizes are small. This results in relatively large cities being more prominently represented at the extremes of the estimates, on account of the larger sample sizes making it possible to have greater confidence in city averages deviating substantially from the mean. A CSV file with all estimates of city averages is available <a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/ibmu8sjs7loy8ag/big5ByCity.csv?dl=0"">on Dropbox</a>.</p>
<p>The units in the graphs below are <em>standard deviations away from the mean of the entire sample</em>. Roughly speaking, average self-reported personality by city varies from -0.2 to 0.2 standard deviations from the mean. However, this likely understates the magnitudes of differences in underlying traits across cities, owing to people anchoring on the people who they know when answering the questions rather than anchoring on the national population, as described in&nbsp;<a href=""https://research.chicagobooth.edu/~/media/49984319C856404DBF130F9F541E59D9.pdf"">Birds of a feather do flock together: behavior and language-based personality assessment reveal personality homophily among couples and friends</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Friends and spouses tend to be similar in a broad range of characteristics (i.e. <em>homophily</em>), such as age, educational level, attitudes, values, and general intelligence. Surprisingly, little evidence has been found for similarity in personality&mdash;one of the most fundamental psychological constructs. We argue that the lack of evidence for personality homophily derives from the tendency of individuals to make personality judgments in relation to a salient comparison group rather than in absolute terms when responding to the self-report and peer-report questionnaires commonly used in personality research (i.e. <em>reference-group effect</em>)</p>

<p><strong>Party cities have high average extraversion</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>The appearance of New Orleans, Miami, Hollywood, Beverly Hills and Newport Beach as amongst the highest on average extraversion is consistent with the the cities' reputations as having high prevalence of partying &amp; socialization. New Orleans and Miami are both highest average extraversion in the data, and 2 of the 3 American cities on this list f<a href=""https://www.thrillist.com/travel/nation/best-party-cities-in-the-world"">list of top 20 party cities in the world</a>.</p>

<p>Newcomers to the area have described Seattleites as being standoffish, cold, distant, and not trusting.[3] While in settings such as bars and parties, people from Seattle tend to mainly interact with their particular clique.[4] One author described the aversion to strangers as: ""people are very polite but not particularly friendly.""[5] In 2008 a peer-reviewed study published in Perspectives on Psychological Science found that among all states, Washington residents ranked 48th in the personality trait extroverted.</p>

<p>The researchers behind the myPersonality app labelled the Facebook profile photos of a subset of the users by their race, so we can stratify by race. The numbers of people for whom we have labelled photos are given below, by race.&nbsp;</p>

<div><img src=""http://images.lesswrong.com/t3_obu_6.png"" alt="""" width=""773"" height=""472"" /></div>
<p>This is not a coincidence. In fact, for the sample as a whole, African Americans' self-reported neuroticism is a full 0.2 standard deviations lower than the rest of the population. This remains true even if we restrict attention to a particular city, like Washington DC:</p>

<p><strong>Agreeableness and Mormonism?<br /> </strong><br />Seven of the 10 cities with highest average agreeableness are in Utah. This corresponds to Utah residents being <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Utah#Religion"">almost 60% Mormon</a>: as a group, Mormons have exceptionally high average agreeableness. One can do an analysis similar to the one that I did with race and neuroticism. I'll return to this later in the context of a more systematic discussion of agreeableness and religion.</p>
<p><strong>New Yorkers really are unusually disagreeable</strong></p>

<p><strong>Low conscientiousness in the Bay Area</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>It's striking that each of Berkeley, San Francisco, San Jose, Hayward and Cuptertino make the list of 10 cities with lowest average conscientiousness, while simultaneously all being in the Bay Area.</p>
<p><strong>Connection with the in person rationalist community?</strong></p>
<p>The finding that Bay Area residents skew toward unusually low conscientiousness should be of especially strong interest to the rationalist community in light of the fact that the Bay Area has become the central hub of community activity.</p>
<p>Slightly shifting the subject, in the <a href=""/lw/nkw/2016_lesswrong_diaspora_survey_results/"">2016 Less Wrong Diaspora Survey</a>, those respondents who reported to having involvement with the in-person community reported to being clincially diagnosed with ADHD with frequency ~20%, <strong>roughly 2x more frequently</strong>&nbsp;than those who reported to having no involvement with the in person community. Low conscientiousness is&nbsp;<a href=""https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3f7d/0a6d7b03d1f9dde07be88b3a8d78b8eb0546.pdf"">known to associate with ADHD</a>, with people who have been diagnosed with ADHD scoring an average of 1 standard deviation below the population mean.&nbsp;In light of these things, it seems possible that there's some connection between high rates of clinical diagnosis of ADHD amongst people being involved with the in person community, and Bay Area residents being unusually low conscientiousness.</p>
<p>As with low extraversion, I'd welcome any ideas on what differentiates the cities with high average conscientiousness from others...</p>

<p><strong>Artsy cities and openness</strong></p>
<p>Openness is associated with artistic interests. Hollywood is the center of cinema in the United States. Sante Fe and New Orleans are considered two of <a href=""http://matadornetwork.com/trips/10-most-artistic-towns-in-the-us/"">the ten most artistic cities</a> in America. So their appearance near the top of the list is in consonance with expectations.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Political Liberalism and Openness</strong></p>
<p>Openness is known to be strongly predictive of liberal political affiliation (c.f. <a href=""http://www.psych.nyu.edu/jost/Carney,%20Jost,%20&amp;%20Gosling%20%282008%29%20The%20secret%20lives%20of%20liberals%20.pdf"">The Secret Lives of Liberals and Conservatives: Personality Profiles, Interaction Styles, and the Things They Leave Behind</a>). So the appearance of many coastal California cities is also in consonance with expectations.&nbsp;</p>

My goal here is only to articulate a plausible hypothesis given the data.]</p>
<p><em>The Moral Economy</em>, which I mentioned in my <a href=""/r/discussion/lw/oad/stress_response_growth_mindset_and_nonviolent/#comments"">post about my recent reading list</a>, talks quite a bit about the crowding-out effect, in which placing external incentives on behavior decreases intrinsic drive for that behavior. This can cause incentives to have a smaller effect on behavior than classical economic theory would predict, or even have the complete opposite effect.</p>
<p>His main source of data is a large number of experiments in which participants across the world play simple games such as prisoner's dilemma, with modifications such as allowing players to punish each other or give bonuses for good behavior. The crowding-out effect is the most frequently observed phenomenon, but it isn't a predictable thing by a long shot: he observes a wide variety of behavior, even including what he calls ""crowding in"" (incentives increasing intrinsic pro-social motivation). So, there's one puzzle: what creates the different response patterns?</p>
<p>Another puzzle: the crowding-out effect suggests, heuristically, that capitalism would decrease pro-social motives. Incentivising behaviors with money made people more selfish in the experiments. Other priming experiments suggest that people get more selfish with the mere mention of money. Furthermore, experiments show that there is a ""spillover"" effect: playing games which crowd out non-selfish motives makes people play more selfishly in subsequent games. So, one might suspect that long-term exposure to capitalism would result in long-term crowding out, creating more selfish behavior in the games.</p>
<p>The opposite is true: exposure to capitalism highly correlates with altruistic behavior in these games. Hunter-gatherer societies which are based on mutual sharing of food are among the least cooperative, when it comes to the games. Why?</p>
<p>The book speculates that advanced economies engender a much higher degree of&nbsp;<em>trust in strangers. </em>If you regularly have economic interactions with strangers without being conned, you come to expect (and provide) a level of common decency.</p>
<p>Experiments also show that crowding-in, rather than crowding-out, can be engendered by allowing participants to discuss what actions should be punished before they start play, rather than making them anonymously dole out punishment without group consent. People from market economies are more likely to act like such an agreement already exists, though, while people from less market-based societies are likely to treat punishments as an insult and react by cooperating less.</p>
<p>It sounds to me like people from free-market societies, or people allowed to discuss the system of punishments before the game,&nbsp;<em>internalize</em> the incentives: they see it as consistent with their intrinsic motives, and so they feel guilty if they are punished, and respond positively by shifting their behavior to be more pro-social. (This is borne out by the data.)</p>
<p>When I say ""guilty"", I have in mind the <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3106346/"">technical distinction between guilt and shame</a>; guilt is about bad actions, whereas shame is a feeling that you <em>yourself</em>&nbsp;are bad. Shame is low self-esteem.</p>
<p>The research in <em>Self Theories </em>(also discussed in my <a href=""/r/discussion/lw/oad/stress_response_growth_mindset_and_nonviolent/#comments"">earlies post</a>)&nbsp;suggests that a shame response is connected to goals such as impressing others, getting good grades, and looking smart. In other words, extrinsic motivators. The students in those studies who reacted well to failure didn't so much have high self-esteem; rather, they were not focused on self-esteem. They were focused on intrinsic motivators. This allowed them to take the feedback provided by failure well, converting it into information about what behaviors don't work (so, more in the realm of guilt) rather than information about them being good or bad (shame).</p>
<p>Both guilt and shame are internalizations of negative reinforcement. However, shame is more likely to lead to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_helplessness"">learned helplessness</a>, while guilt is more likely to lead to adaptive behaviors.</p>
<p>This reminds me of <a href=""https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/ayelet.fishbach/research/FD_JCR_05.pdf"">Goals as Excuses or Guides</a>&nbsp;by Fishbach &amp; Dhar. They talks about a similar distinction with respect to positive rather than negative reinforcement. When we succeed, our subsequent behavior depends on what we think that success meant. If we interpret it as progress on a goal, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-licensing"">moral self-licensing</a> is more likely to occur. This is a phenomenon where you perceive yourself as good, and therefore, allow yourself to do more bad things. A classic example would be someone trying to quit smoking who feels good about going for a day without smoking, and rewards themselves with a smoke ""because they deserve it"". Fishbach &amp; Dhar find that re-framing the achievement in terms of showing commitment to values, rather than progress toward goals, has a tendency to reinforce the behavior rather than the paradoxical self-licensing effect.</p>
<p>To make an analogy to the guilt vs shame distinction: moral self-licensing happens when we interpret our actions as meaning <em>we</em>&nbsp;are good, whereas reinforcement of the behavior happens when we think the <em>actions</em>&nbsp;are good. Again we can see the connection to self-esteem. High self-esteem seems as problematic as low self-esteem: it causes us to paradoxically work against ourselves. Concentrating on how our actions relate to what we value (IE, concentrating on our intrinsic motives) makes self-esteem less relevant and our actions less self-contradictory.</p>
<p>Human motivation seems to be really complicated! To summarize my hypothesis: extrinsic motivations crowd out intrinsic motivations, which can cause incentives to paradoxically have the opposite of the intended effect. However, this is not always observed in the experiments in <em>The Moral Economy</em>&nbsp;because sometimes people <em>internalize</em>&nbsp;incentives. It seems incentives can be internalized in at least two different ways: they can be connected to <em>actions</em>, or they can be connected to <em>self-esteem</em>. Connecting negative reinforcement to self-esteem is called <em><strong>shame</strong></em> in the psychological literature, and leads to learned helplessness. Internalizing negative reinforcement via a connection to actions is called <em><strong>guilt</strong></em>, and seems to be more adaptive. Connecting positive reinforcement to self-esteem could be called <em style=""font-weight: bold;"">pride</em>. It tends to make us work against our own goals via moral self-licensing. For the sake of rounding out the set of terms, I'll call the internalization of positive reinforcement as connecting our actions to our values <em style=""font-weight: bold;"">joy</em>. Joy reinforces successful behaviors, making our actions tend to be more consistent with our values.</p>",ProofOfLogic,proofoflogic,ProofOfLogic,

<p>Of all the terrible vices known to man, I guess NFL gambling and alternative medicine aren&#8217;t very terrible. Making medicine that doesn&#8217;t work (if it worked, it wouldn&#8217;t be <em>alternative</em>) is also a tough way to make money. But if you&#8217;re able to squeeze a p-value of 0.05 for acupuncture out of <a href=""http://www.dcscience.net/2011/05/31/acupuncturists-show-that-acupuncture-doesnt-work-but-conclude-the-opposite-journal-fails/"" target=""_blank"">a trial that clearly shows that acupuncture has zero effect</a>, you can make money and get a PhD in medicine!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also hard to make money off of gambling on the NFL. However, you can make money by <em>selling</em> NFL gambling advice. For example, before the Eagles played as 6 point underdogs on the turf in Seattle after a 208 yard rushing game, <a href=""http://www.vegasinsider.com/nfl/story.cfm/story/1815888"" target=""_blank"">gambling guru Vince Akins declared</a>:</p>

<h2>Hacking in Depth</h2>
<p><em>[This part gets stats-heavy enough to earn this post the </em><a href=""https://putanumonit.com/category/math-class/"" target=""_blank"">Math Class</a><em> tag. If you want to skip the textbooky bits and get down to gambling tips, scroll down to </em>&#8220;Reading the Fish&#8221;<em>]</em></p>
<p>The easiest way to generate multiple hypotheses out of a single data set (that didn&#8217;t show what you wanted it to show) is to break the data into subgroups. You can break the population into many groups at once (<a href=""https://xkcd.com/882/"" target=""_blank"">Green Jelly Bean method</a>), or in consecutive stages (<a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/01/02/two-dark-side-statistics-papers/"" target=""_blank"">Elderly Hispanic Woman method</a>).</p>
<p>The latter method works like this: let&#8217;s say that you have a group of people (for example, <a href=""https://putanumonit.com/2016/10/06/theory-of-an-immoral-sentiment/"" target=""_blank"">Tajiks</a>) who suffer from a medical condition (for example, <a href=""https://putanumonit.com/2016/10/06/theory-of-an-immoral-sentiment/"" target=""_blank"">descolada</a>). Normally, exactly one half of sick people recover. You invented a miracle drug that takes that number all the way up to&#8230; 50%. That&#8217;s not good enough even for the <a href=""http://www.dcscience.net/paterson-acu-BJGP-2011.pdf"" target=""_blank"">British Journal of General Practice</a>.</p>
<p>But then you notice that of the men who took the drug 49% recovered, and of the women, 51% did. And if you only look at women above age 60, by pure chance, that number is 55%. And maybe 13 of these older Tajik women, because Tajikistan didn&#8217;t build a wall, happened to be Hispanic. And of those, by accident of random distribution, 10 happened to recover. Hey, 10 out of 13 is a 77% success rate, and more importantly it gives a p-value of&#8230; 0.046! Eureka, your medical career is saved with the publication of &#8220;Miracle Drug Cures Descolada in Elderly Hispanic Women&#8221; and <a href=""https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/amy-cuddy/presence/9780316256575/"" target=""_blank"">you get a book deal</a>.</p>
<p>Hopefully my readers&#8217; <a href=""https://putanumonit.com/2015/12/17/009-smelly/"" target=""_blank"">nose is sharp enough</a> not to fall for 10/13 elderly Hispanic women. Your first guide should be the following simple rule:</p>
<p class=""rules""><strong>Rule of small sample sizes </strong>&#8211; If the <a href=""https://putanumonit.com/2016/04/17/022-power_skeptic/"" target=""_blank"">sample size is too small</a>, any result <a href=""http://andrewgelman.com/2014/11/17/power-06-looks-like-get-used/"" target=""_blank"">is almost certainly just mining noise</a>.</p>
<p class=""rules""><strong>Corollary</strong> &#8211; If the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMR_vaccine_controversy#1998_Lancet_paper"" target=""_blank"">sample size of a study</a> is outnumbered 100:1 by the number of <a href=""http://www.jennymccarthybodycount.com/"" target=""_blank"">people who died because of that study</a>,  it&#8217;s probably not a great study.</p>
<p>But what if the drug did nothing detectable for most of the population, but cured 61 of 90 Hispanic women of all ages. That&#8217;s more than two thirds, the sample size of 90 isn&#8217;t tiny, and it comes out to a p-value of 0.0005, is that good enough?</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s do the math.</p>
<p>First, some theory. P-values are generally a terrible tool. Testing with a p-value threshold of 0.05 should mean that you accept a false result by accident only 5% of the time, yet <a href=""http://www.dcscience.net/2014/03/24/on-the-hazards-of-significance-testing-part-2-the-false-discovery-rate-or-how-not-to-make-a-fool-of-yourself-with-p-values/"" target=""_blank"">even in theory using a 5% p-value makes a fool of you over 30% of the time</a>.  P-values do one cool thing, however: they transform any distribution into a uniform distribution. For example, most samples from a normal distribution will lie close to the mean, but their <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value"" target=""_blank"">p-values</a> will be spread evenly (uniformly) across the range between 0 and 1.</p>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_distribution_(continuous)"" target=""_blank"">Uniform distributions</a> are easy to deal with. For example, if we take N samples from a uniform distribution and arrange them by order, they will fall <em>on average</em> on 1/N+1, 2/N+1, .. N/N+1. If you test four hypotheses (e.g. that four kinds of jelly beans cause acne) and their p-values fall roughly on 1/(4+1) = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 you know that they&#8217;re all indistinguishable from the null hypothesis as a group.</p>
<p>Usually you would only see the p-value of the best hypothesis reported, i.e. &#8220;Wonder drug cures descolada in elderly Hispanic women with p=0.0005&#8221;. The first step towards sanity is to apply the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonferroni_correction"" target=""_blank"">Bonferroni</a> rule:</p>
<p class=""rules""><strong>Bonferroni Rule</strong> &#8211; A p-value of α for a single hypothesis is worth about as much as a p-value of α/N for the best of N hypotheses.</p>
<p>The Bonferroni correction is usually given as an upper bound, namely that if you use an α/N p-value threshold for N hypotheses you will accept a null hypothesis as true no more often than if you use an α threshold for a single hypothesis. It actually works well as an approximation too, allowing us to replace <i>no more often</i> with <i>about as often</i>. I haven&#8217;t seen this math spelled out in the first 5 google hits, so I&#8217;ll have to do it myself.</p>
<p>h<sub>1</sub>,&#8230;,h<sub>N</sub> are N p-values for N independent tests of null hypotheses. h<sub>1</sub>,&#8230;,h<sub>N</sub> are all uniformly distributed between 0 and 1.</p>
<p><em>The chance that one of the N p-values falls below α/N</em> = P(min(h<sub>1</sub>,&#8230;,h<sub>N</sub>) &lt; α/N) = 1 &#8211; (1 &#8211; α/N)<sup>N</sup> ≈ 1 &#8211; e<sup>-α</sup> ≈ 1 &#8211; (1-α) = α = <em>the chance that single p-value falls below α</em>. The last bit of math there depends on a <a href=""http://www.drcruzan.com/DerivativesII.html"" target=""_blank"">linear approximation</a> of e<sup>x </sup>=1+x when x is close to 0.</p>
<p>The Bonferroni Rule applies directly when the tests are independent, but that is not the case with the Elderly Hispanic Woman method. The &#8220;cure&#8221; rate of white men is correlated positively with the rate for all white people (a broader category) and with young white men (a narrower subgroup). Is the rule still good for EHW hacking? I programmed my own simulated unscrupulous researcher to find out, <a href=""https://github.com/yashkaf/oldhispanic/blob/master/Multy.R"" target=""_blank"">here&#8217;s the code on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>My simulation included Tajiks of three age groups (young, adult, old), two genders (the Tajiks are lagging behind on respecting genderqueers) and four races (but they&#8217;re great with racial diversity). Each of the 2*3*4=24 subgroups has 500 Tajiks in it, for a total population of 12,000. Descolada has a 50% mortality rate, so 6,000 / 12,000 cured is the average &#8220;null&#8221; result we would expect if the drug didn&#8217;t work at all. For the entire population, we would get p=0.05 if only 90 extra people were cured (6,090/12,000) for a success rate of 50.75%. A meager success rate of 51.5% takes the p-value all the way down to 0.0005.</p>
<p class=""rules""><strong>Rule of large sample sizes</strong> &#8211; With a large sample size, statistical significance doesn&#8217;t equal <em>actual</em> significance. With a large enough sample you can get tiny p-values with miniscule effect sizes.</p>
<p class=""rules""><strong>Corollary</strong> &#8211; If p-values are useless for small sample sizes, and they&#8217;re useless for large sample sizes, maybe WE SHOULD STOP USING FUCKING P-VALUES FOR HYPOTHESIS TESTING. Just compare the <strong>measured </strong>effect size to the <strong>predicted </strong>effect size, and use Bayes&#8217; rule to update the likelihood of your prediction being correct.</p>
<p>P-values aren&#8217;t very useful in <strong>getting close to the truth</strong>, but they&#8217;re everywhere, they&#8217;re easy to work with and they&#8217;re moderately useful for <strong>getting away from bullshit</strong>. Since the latter is our goal in this essay we&#8217;ll stick with looking at p-values for now.</p>
<p>Back to Tajikistan. I simulated the entire population 1,000 times for each of three drugs: a useless one with a 50% success rate (<span style=""color:#993300;"">null drug</span>), a statistically significant one with 50.75% (<span style=""color:#993300;"">good drug)</span> and a doubly significant drug with 51.5% (<span style=""color:#993300;"">awesome drug</span>). Yes, <a href=""https://putanumonit.com/2016/09/01/epipenomenon/"" target=""_blank"">our standards for awesomeness in medicine</a> aren&#8217;t very high. I looked at the p-value of each possible sub-group of the population to pick the best one, that&#8217;s the p-hacking part.</p>
<p>Below is a sample of the output:</p>
<p class=""code"">13 hispanic 1    0.122530416511473<br />
14 female hispanic 2    0.180797304026783<br />
15 young hispanic 2    0.25172233581543<br />
16 young female hispanic 3    0.171875<br />
17 white 1    0.0462304905364621<br />
18 female white 2    0.572232224047184<br />
19 young white 2    0.25172233581543<br />
20 young female white 3   0.9453125<br />
21 adult 1    0.368777154492162<br />
22 female adult 2    0.785204746078306<br />
23 asian 1    0.953769509463538<br />
24 female asian 2    0.819202695973217</p>
<p>The second integer is the number of categories applied to the sub-group (so &#8220;asian&#8221; = 1, &#8220;asian adult female&#8221; = 3). It&#8217;s the &#8220;depth&#8221; of the hacking. In our case there are 60 groups to choose from: 1 with depth 0 (the entire population), 9 with depth 1, 26 with depth 2, 24 with depth 3. Since we&#8217;re testing the 60 groups as 60 separate hypotheses, by the Bonferroni Rule the 0.05 p-value should be replaced with 0.05 / 60 categories = 0.00083.</p>
<p>In each of the 1,000 simulations, I picked the group with the smallest p-value and plotted it along with the &#8220;hacking depth&#8221; that achieved it. The vertical lines are at p=0.05 p=0.00083. The horizontal axis the hacked p-value on a log scale and the vertical how many of the 1,000 simulations landed below it:</p>

<p>For the null drug, p-hacking achieves a &#8220;publishable&#8221; p-value of</p>
<p>If your goal is to do actual science (as opposed to getting published in <em>Science</em>), you want to be comparing the evidence for competing hypotheses, not just looking if the null hypothesis is rejected. The null hypothesis is that we have a 50% <span style=""color:#993300;"">null drug</span>, and the competing hypothesis are the <span style=""color:#993300;"">good and awesome drugs</span> at 50.75% and 51.5% success rates, respectively.</p>
<p>Without p-hacking, the null drug will hit below p=0.05 5% of the time (duh), the good drug will get there 50% of the time, and the awesome drug 95% of the time. To a Bayesian, getting a p-value below 0.05 is a very strong signal that we have a useful drug on our hands: 50%:5% = 10:1 likelihood ratio that it&#8217;s the good drug and 95%:5% = 19:1 that it&#8217;s the awesome drug. If ahead of time we thought that each of the cases is equally likely (1:1:1) ratio, our ratios would now be 1:10:19, this means that the probability that the drug is the null one went from 1/3 to 1/(1+10+19) = 1/30. The null drug is 10 times less likely.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re utterly confused by the preceding paragraph, you can <a href=""https://arbital.com/p/bayes_rule_odds/"" target=""_blank"">read up on Bayes&#8217; rule and likelihood ratio on Arbital</a>, or just trust me that <strong>without p-hacking, getting a p-value below 0.05 is a strong signal that the drug is useful</strong>.</p>
<p>With p-hacking, however, the good and the awesome drugs don&#8217;t do so well. We&#8217;re now looking how often each drug falls below the Bonferroni Rule line of p=0.00083. Instead of 50% and 95% of the time, the good and awesome drugs get there 23% and 72% of the time. If we started from 1:1:1 odds, the new odds are roughly 1:5:15, and the probability that the drug is the null one is 1/21 instead of 1/30. The null drug is only 7 times less likely.</p>
<p class=""rules""><strong>Rule of hacking skepticism </strong>&#8211; Even though a frequentist is happy with a <i>corrected</i> p-value, a Bayesian knows better. P-hacking helps a bad (null) drug more than it does a good one (which is significant without hacking). Thus, hitting even a corrected p-value threshold is weaker evidence against the null hypothesis.</p>
<p>You can see it in the chart above: for every given p-value (vertical line) the better drugs have more green points in its vicinity (indicating less depth of hacking) and the bad drug has more red because it has to dig down to a narrow subgroup to luck into significance.</p>
<p>Just for fun, I ran another simulation in which instead of holding the success probability for each patient constant, I fixed the total proportion of cures for each drug. So in the rightmost line (null drug) exactly 6,000 of the 12,000 were cured, for the good drug exactly 6,090 and for the awesome drug 6,180.</p>

<p>We can see more separation in this case &#8211; since the awesome drug is at p=0.0005 for the entire group, hacking can not make it any worse (that&#8217;s where the tall green line is). Because for each drug the total cures are fixed, if one subgroup has more successes the other one by necessity have less. This mitigates the effects of p-hacking somewhat, but the null drug still gets to very low p-values some of the time.</p>

If you think that for example there&#8217;s an <strong>ε</strong> chance that the result is completely fake, that <strong>ε</strong> is roughly the floor on p-values you should consider.</p>
<p>For example, if I think that at least 1 in 1,000 psychology studies have a fatal experimental flaw or are just <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/03/health/research/noted-dutch-psychologist-stapel-accused-of-research-fraud.html"" target=""_blank"">completely fabricated</a>, I would give any p-value below 1/1,000 about as much weight as 1/1,000. So there&#8217;s a 1.2*10^-10 chance that the parapsychology meta-analysis mentioned above was perfect and got a false positive result by chance, but at least 1 in 1,000 chance that one of the studies in it was bogus enough to make the result invalid.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s apply our manual to the Eagles game:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Eagles are 10-0 against the spread since Dec 18, 2005 as an underdog and on turf after they&#8217;ve had more than 150 yards rushing last game.</p></blockquote>
<p>First of all, if someone tells you about a 10-0 streak you can assume that the actual streak is 10-1. If the Eagles had won the 11th game going back, the author would have surely said that the streak was 11-0!</p>
<p>The sample size of 11 is really small, but on the other hand in this specific case the error of the measure is 0 &#8211; we know perfectly well if the Eagles won or lost against the spread. This doesn&#8217;t happen in real life research, but when the error is 0 the <em>experimental power </em> is perfect and a small sample size doesn&#8217;t bother us.</p>
<p>What bother us is the insane number of possible variables the author could have mentioned. Instead of [Eagles / underdog / turf / after 150 yards rushing], the game could be described as [Seattle / at home / after road win / against team below average in passing] or [NFC East team / traveling west / against a team with a winning record] or [Team coming off home win / afternoon time slot / clear weather / opponent ranked top-5 in defense]. It&#8217;s hard to even count the possibilities, we can try putting them in separate bins and multiplying:</p>
<ol>
<li>Descriptors of home team &#8211; division, geography, record, result of previous game, passing/rushing/turnovers in previous game, any of the many season stats and rankings &#8211; at least 20</li>
<li>Descriptors of road team &#8211; at least 20</li>
<li>Game circumstances &#8211; weather, time slot, week of season, field condition, spread, travel, matchup history etc. &#8211; at least 10.</li>
</ol>
<p>Even if you pick just 1 descriptor in each category, this allows you to &#8220;test&#8221; more than 20*20*10 = 4,000 hypotheses. What does it mean for the Eagles? A 10-1 streak has a p-value of 0.0107, about 1/93. But we had 4,000 potential hypotheses! 1/93 is terrible compared to the p=1/4,000 we would have expected to see by chance alone.</p>
<p>Of course, this means that the gambling guru didn&#8217;t even bother testing all the options, he did just enough fishing to get a publishable number and published it. But with so much potential hacking, 10-1 is as much evidence <strong>against the Eagles</strong> as it is in their favor. The Eagles, a 6 point underdog, got their <a href=""http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2016112010/2016/REG11/eagles@seahawks#menu=gameinfo%7CcontentId%3A0ap3000000743302&amp;tab=recap"" target=""_blank"">asses kicked by 11 points</a> in Seattle.</p>

<p>You can apply the category-counting method whenever the data you&#8217;re seeing seems a bit too <em>selected. </em>The ad above tells you that Trinity is highly ranked in &#8220;faculties combining research and instruction&#8221;. This narrow phrasing should immediately make you think of the dozens of other specialized categories in which Trinity College <em>isn&#8217;t</em> ranked anywhere near the top. A college ranked #1 overall  is a great college. A college ranked #1 in an overly specific category within an overly specific region is great at fishing.</p>

<h2>To No And</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s bad enough when people don&#8217;t notice that they&#8217;re being bamboozled by hacking, but digging deep to dredge up a narrow (and meaningless) result can sound more persuasive than a general result. Here&#8217;s an absolutely delightful example, from <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/the-bill-simmons-podcast/ep-141-mike-lombardi-joe-house-and-jacko#t=28:05"" target=""_blank"">Bill Simmons&#8217; NFL gambling podcast</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Joe House:</strong> I&#8217;m taking Denver. There&#8217;s one angle that I like. I like an angle.</p>
<p><strong>Bill:</strong> I&#8217;m waiting.</p>
<p><strong>Joe House:</strong> Defending Super Bowl champions, like the Denver Broncos, 24-2 against the spread since 1981 if they are on the road after a loss <em>and</em> matched up against a team that the previous week won both straight up <em>and</em> against the spread <em>and </em>the Super Bowl champion is not getting 7 or more points. This all applies to the Denver Broncos here, a wonderful nugget from my friend Big Al McMordie.</p>
<p><strong>Bill:</strong> *sigh* Oh my God.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve lost count of how many categories it took House to get to a 24-2 (clearly 24-3 in reality) statistic. What&#8217;s impressive is how House sounds more excited with each <span style=""color:#ff0000;""><em>&#8220;and&#8221;</em></span> he adds to the description of the matchup. To me, each new category decreases the likelihood that the result is meaningful by multiplying the number of prior possibilities. To House, it seems like Denver fitting in such an overly specific description is a coincidence that further reinforces the result.</p>
<p>This is called the conjunction fallacy. I&#8217;ll let <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/jk/burdensome_details/"" target=""_blank"">Eliezer explain</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/ji/conjunction_fallacy/"">conjunction fallacy</a> is when humans rate the probability P(A&amp;B) higher than the probability P(B), even though it is a theorem that P(A&amp;B) &lt;= P(B).  For example, in one experiment in 1981, 68% of the subjects ranked it more likely that &#8220;Reagan will provide federal support for unwed mothers and cut federal support to local governments&#8221; than that &#8220;Reagan will provide federal support for unwed mothers.&#8221; [&#8230;]</p>
<p>Which is to say:  Adding detail can make a scenario SOUND MORE PLAUSIBLE, even though the event necessarily BECOMES LESS PROBABLE. [&#8230;]</p>
<p>In the <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/ji/conjunction_fallacy/"">1982 experiment</a> where professional forecasters assigned systematically higher probabilities to &#8220;Russia invades Poland, followed by suspension of diplomatic relations between USA and USSR&#8221; versus &#8220;Suspension of diplomatic relations between USA and USSR&#8221;, each experimental group was only presented with one proposition. [&#8230;]</p>
<p>What could the forecasters have done to avoid the conjunction fallacy, without seeing the direct comparison, or even knowing that anyone was going to test them on the conjunction fallacy?  It seems to me, that they would need to notice the word <span style=""color:#ff0000;""><strong>&#8220;and&#8221;</strong></span>.  They would need to be wary of it &#8211; not just wary, but leap back from it.  Even without knowing that researchers were afterward going to test them on the conjunction fallacy particularly.  They would need to notice the conjunction of <em>two entire details,</em> and be <em>shocked</em> by the audacity of anyone asking them to endorse such an insanely complicated prediction.</p></blockquote>

<p>11 &#8220;ands&#8221; is a level of bullshit that can only be found in one stinky stall of the washrooms of science, the gift that keeps on giving, the old faithful: power posing. After power posing decisively failed to replicate in an experiment with 5 times the original sample size, the authors of the original study listed 11 ways in which the experimental setup of the replication differed from the original (<a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/274458966_Review_and_Summary_of_Research_on_the_Embodied_Effects_of_Expansive_vs_Contractive_Nonverbal_Displays"" target=""_blank"">Table 2 here</a>). These differences include: time in poses (6 minutes in replication vs. 2 minutes in the original), country (Switzerland vs. US), filler task (word vs. faces) and 8 more. The authors claim that <em>any one</em> of the differences could account for the failure of replication.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s wrong with this argument? Let&#8217;s consider what it would mean for the<em> argument to be true</em>. If it&#8217;s true that any of the 11 changes to the original setup could destroy the power posing effect, it means that the power posing effect only exists in that very specific setup. I.e. power posing only works when the pose is held for 2 minutes <span style=""color:#ff0000;"">and</span> only for Americans <span style=""color:#ff0000;"">and</span> only after a verbal task <span style=""color:#ff0000;"">and 8 more ands</span>.

<p><img src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/RjbTi6ETSo66ygfEY/hx2n8gsarm225mc1j9jd"" alt="""" width=""315"" height=""528""></p>
<p>The extorter can let the default <strong>Def</strong> happen, or can instead do a threat, ending up in point <strong>T</strong>. Then the victim can resist (<strong>Res</strong>) or surrender (<strong>Sur</strong>). If the victim resists, the extorter has the option of carrying out their threat (<strong>C</strong>) or not doing so (<strong>¬C</strong>).</p>
<p>You need a few conditions to make this into a extortion situation:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Sur</strong> has to be the best outcome for B (or else the extortion has no point).</li>
<li>To make sure that <strong>T</strong> is a true threat, <strong>Sur</strong> has to be worse than <strong>Def</strong> for V, and <strong>C</strong> has to be worse that <strong>¬C</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>Def</strong> for <strong>B</strong>.</li>
<li>And to make this into extortion, <strong>C</strong> has to be worse than <strong>Def</strong> for V.</li>
</ol> 
<ul>
</ul>
<p>A mere threat doesn't make this into extortion. Indeed, trade negotiations are a series of repeated threats from both sides, making offers with the implicit threat that they will walk away from the deal entirely if that offer is not accepted.</p>
<p>But if <strong>C</strong> is worse that <strong>Def</strong> for V, then this seems a true extortion: V will end up worse if they resist a extorter who carries out their threats, and they would have much preferred that the extorter not be able to make credible threats in the first place. And the only reason the extorter made the threats, was to force the victim to surrender.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Fairness and equity</h2>
<p>Note that this is not about fairness or niceness. It's perfectly possible to extort someone into giving you fair treatment (depending on how you see the default point, many of the boycotts during the civil right movement would count as extortion).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The all important default</h2>
<p>This model seems clear; so why is it so hard to identify extortion in real life? One key issue is disagreement over the default point. Consider the following situations:</p>
<ul>
<li>During the Cuban missile crisis, it was clear to the Americans that the default was no nuclear missiles in Cuba, and the soviets were recklessly violating this default. To the USSR, the default was obviously that countries could station nuclear missiles on their allies' territories (like the Americans were doing in Turkey). Then, once the blockade was in place and the soviet ships were on their way, the default seems to be nuclear war (meaning that practically nothing could count as extortion in this situation).</li>
<li>Take a management-union dispute, where management wants to cut pay. The unions can argue that this violates long-standing company policy of decent pay. Management can retort that the default is actually to be a profitable company, and that their industry is currently in decline, so declining pay should be the default. After a bit of negotiating, the two seem to reach the framework of a decent understanding - is this now the default for further negotiations?</li>
<li>""You must give me something to satisfy my population!"" ""Now, I'm fine with this, but when our army arrives, I'm not sure I can control them."" ""Well, I'll try and talk to my president, but he's crazy! Throw me some sort of bone here, will you?"" All these types of arguments are an attempt to shift the default in their favour. Sure, the <em>negotiator</em> isn't threatening you, they just needs your help to contain the <em>default </em>behaviour of their people/army/president.</li>
<li>Two people are negotiating to trade water and food. If no trade is reached, they will both die. Can ""both dying"" be considered a reasonable default? Or is ""both trade at least enough to ensure mutual survival"" a default, seeing as ""both dying"" is not an outcome either would ever want? Can a situation that will never realistically happen be considered a default?</li>
<li>Take the purest example of blackmail (extortion via information): a photographer snaps shots of an adulterous couple, and sells the photos back to them for much money. Blackmail! But what if they just happened to be in a shot that the photographer was taking of other people? Then the photographer is suppressing the photos to help the couple, and charging a reasonable fee for that (what if the fee is unreasonable? does it make a difference?). But what if the photographer deliberately hangs around areas where trysts often happen, to get some extra cash? Or what if they don't do that deliberately, but photographers who don't hang around these areas can't turn a profit and change jobs, so that only these ones are left?</li>
</ul>
<p>These examples should be sufficient to illustrate the degree of the problem, and also show how defaults are often forged by implicit and explicit norms, so extortions are clearest cut when they also include norm violation, trust violation, or other dubious elements. behaviours. In a sense, picking the default is the important thing; picking exactly the right default is less important, since once the default is known, people can adjust their expectations and behaviour in consequence.</p>",Stuart_Armstrong,stuart_armstrong,Stuart_Armstrong,

<blockquote>
<p>Specifically, I think that LW declined from its peak by losing its top bloggers to new projects. Eliezer went to do AI research full-time at MIRI, Anna started running CFAR, various others started to work on those two organizations or others (I went to work at MetaMed). There was a sudden exodus of talent, which reduced posting frequency, and took the wind out of the sails.</p>
<p>One trend I dislike is that highly competent people invariably stop hanging out with the less-high-status, less-accomplished, often younger, members of their group. VIPs have a strong temptation to retreat to a ""VIP island"" -- which leaves everyone else short of role models and stars, and ultimately kills communities. (I'm genuinely not accusing anybody of nefarious behavior, I'm just noting a normal human pattern.) Like -- obviously it's not fair to reward competence with extra burdens, I'm not that much of a collectivist. But I think that potentially human group dynamics won't work without something like ""community-spiritedness"" -- there are benefits to having a community of hundreds or thousands, for instance, that you cannot accrue if you only give your time and attention to your ten best friends.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While I agree that the trend described in the second paragraph happens (and I also dislike the effects), I have another model that I think more tightly explains why the first paragraph happened. I also think that it's important to build systems with the constraint in mind that they work for the individuals inside those systems. A system that relies on trapped, guilted, or oppressed participants is a system at risk for collapse.</p>
<p>So in order to create great public spaces for rationalists, we don't just need to have good models of community development. Those can tell us what we need from people, but might not include how to make people fill those slots in a sustainable way.</p>
<p>To explain why lots of top bloggers left at once, let me present a model of adult development, drawn from George Vaillant&rsquo;s modification of Erik Erikson&rsquo;s model, as discussed in <a href=""https://smile.amazon.com/Triumphs-Experience-George-E-Vaillant-ebook/dp/B00A4NF904/ref=nosim?tag=vglnk-c319-20"">Triumphs of Experience</a>. It focuses on 6 different &lsquo;developmental tasks,&rsquo; rather than &lsquo;stages&rsquo; or &lsquo;levels.&rsquo; Each has success and failure conditions associated with it; a particular component of life goes either well or poorly. They&rsquo;re also not explicitly hierarchical; one could achieve the &ldquo;third&rdquo; task before achieving the &ldquo;second&rdquo; task, for example, but one still notices trends in the ages at which the tasks have been completed.</p>
<p>Triumphs of Experience is the popsci treatment of the Harvard Grant Study of development; they took a bunch of Harvard freshmen and sophomores, subjected them to a bunch of psychological tests and interviews, and then watched them grow up over the course of ~70 years. This sort of longitudinal study gives them a very different perspective from cross-sectional studies, because they have much better pictures of what people looked like before and after.</p>
<p>I'll briefly list the developmental tasks, followed by quotes from Triumphs of Expertise that characterize succeeding at them. The bolded ones seem most relevant:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Identity vs. Role Diffusion: &ldquo;Live independently of family of origin, and to be self-supporting.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Intimacy vs. Isolation: &ldquo;capacity to live with another person in an emotionally attached, interdependent, and committed relationship for ten years or more.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Career Consolidation vs. Role Diffusion</strong>: &ldquo;Commitment, compensation, contentment, and competence.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Generativity vs. Stagnation</strong>: &ldquo;assumption of sustained responsibility for the growth and well-being of others still young enough to need care but old enough to make their own decisions.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Guardianship vs. Hoarding</strong>: The previous level covered one-on-one relationships; this involves more broad, future-focused sorts of endeavors. Instead of mentoring one person, one is caretaker of a library for many.</li>
<li>Integrity vs. Despair: Whether one is graceful in the face of death or not. [1]</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As mentioned before, they're ordered but the ordering isn't strict, and so you can imagine someone working on any developmental task, or multiple at once. But it seems likely that people will focus most of their attention on their earliest ongoing task.</p>
<p>It seems to me like several of the top bloggers were focusing on blogging because something was blocking their attempts to focus on career consolidation, and so they focused on building up a community instead. When the community was ready enough, they switched to their career--but as people were all in the same community, this happened mostly at once.</p>
<p>I think that &ldquo;community-spiritedness&rdquo; in the sense that Sarah is pointing at, in the sense of wanting to take care of the raising of new generations or collection and dissemination of ideas, comes most naturally to people working on generativity and guardianship. People work on that most easily if they&rsquo;re either done with consolidating their career or their career is community support (in one form or another). If not, it seems like there&rsquo;s a risk that opportunities to pursue earlier needs will seem more immediate and be easily able to distract them.</p>
<p>(In retrospect, I fell prey to this; I first <a href=""/lw/n0l/lesswrong_20/"">publicly embarked</a> on the project of LW revitalization a year ago, and then after about a month started a search for a new job, which took up the time I had been spending on LW. If doing it again, I think the main thing I would have tried to do differently is budgeting a minimally sufficient amount of time for LW while doing the job search with the rest of my time, as opposed to spending time how it felt most useful. This might have kept the momentum going and allowed me to spend something like 80% of my effort on the search and 20% on LW, rather than unintentionally spending 100% and 0%.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. I interpret the last task through the lens of radical acceptance, not deathism; given that one is in fact dying, whether one responds in a way that helps themselves and those around them seems like an important thing to ask about separately from the question of how much effort we should put into building a world where that is the case later and less frequently than the present.</p>",Vaniver,vaniver,Vaniver,

If all humans were glorified computers, then game theory modelling meant using our brains to capture information from reality and mapping out the structure of a game and the preferences of an agent. Our brains were the estimator in this model, which meant all game theory meant to model reality was estimated. It was just estimated using our neural network. It seems trivial when I write it out, but the current methods for evaluating these types of models still seem to be based on a non-predictive intuition.</span></p>

And, look this might be the true model of reality in all its parsimony, but as a counter-factual could you imagine this positive view of rationality receiving any acceptance If Becker argued that different tiers of races was the true equilibrium? At the very least there is a predictive complexity here that is missing (not to dismiss Becker's research, it's great).</span></p>

<p>Principles:</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s possible that the right thing is a quick fix to Less Wrong as it is; this is about exploring what could be done if we started anew.</li>
<li>If we decided to start anew, what the software should do is only one part of what would need to be decided; that&rsquo;s the part I address here.</li>
<li>As <a href=""/lw/o5z/on_the_importance_of_less_wrong_or_another_single/"">Anna Salamon set out</a>, the goal is to create a <em>commons</em> of knowledge, such that a great many people have read the same stuff. A system that tailored what you saw to your own preferences would have its own strengths but would work entirely against this goal.</li>
<li>I therefore think the right goal is to build a website whose content reflects the preferences of one person, or a small set of people. In what follows I refer to those people as the &ldquo;root set&rdquo;.</li>
<li>A commons needs a clear line between the content that&rsquo;s in and the content that&rsquo;s out. Much of the best discussion is on closed mailing lists; it will be easier to get the participation of time-limited contributors if there&rsquo;s a clear line of what discussion we want them to have read, and it&rsquo;s short.</li>
<li>However this alone excludes a lot of people who might have good stuff to add; it would be good to find a way to get the best of both worlds between a closed list and an open forum.</li>
<li>I want to structure discussion as a set of concentric circles.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Discussion in the innermost circle forms part of the commons of knowledge all can be assumed to be familiar with; surrounding it are circles of discussion where the bar is progressively lower. With a slider, readers choose which circle they want to read.</li>
<li>Content from rings further out may be pulled inwards by the votes of trusted people.</li>
<li>Content never moves outwards except in the case of spam/abuse.</li>
<li>Users can create top-level content in further-out rings and allow the votes of other users to move it closer to the centre. Users are encouraged to post whatever they want in the outermost rings, to treat it as one would an open thread or similar; the best content will be voted inwards.</li>
<li>Trust in users flows through endorsements starting from the root set.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>More specifics on what that vision might look like:</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>The site gives all content (posts, top-level comments, and responses) a star rating from 0 to 5 where 0 means &ldquo;spam/abuse/no-one should see&rdquo;.</li>
<li>The rating that content can receive is capped by the rating of the parent; the site will never rate a response higher than its parent, or a top-level comment higher than the post it replies to.</li>
<li>Users control a &ldquo;slider&rdquo; a la Slashdot which controls the level of content that they see: set to 4, they see only 4 and 5-star content.</li>
<li>By default, content from untrusted users gets two stars; this leaves a star for &ldquo;unusually bad&rdquo; (eg rude) and one for &ldquo;actual spam or other abuse&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Content ratings above 2 never go down, except to 0; they only go up. Thus, the content in these circles can grow but not shrink, to create a stable commons.</li>
<li>Since a parent&rsquo;s rating acts as a cap on the highest rating a child can get, when a parent&rsquo;s rating goes up, this can cause a child&rsquo;s rating to go up too.</li>
<li>Users rate content on this 0-5 scale, including their own content; the site aggregates these votes to generate content ratings.</li>
<li>Users also rate other users on the same scale, for how much they are trusted to rate content.</li>
<li>There is a small set of &ldquo;root&rdquo; users whose user ratings are wholly trusted. Trust flows from these users using some attack resistant trust metric.</li>
<li>Trust in a particular user can always go down as well as up.</li>
<li>Only votes from the most trusted users will suffice to bestow the highest ratings on content.</li>
<li>The site may show more trusted users with high sliders lower-rated content specifically to ask them to vote on it, for instance if a comment is receiving high ratings from users who are one level below them in the trust ranking. This content will be displayed in a distinctive way to make this purpose clear.</li>
<li>Votes from untrusted users never directly affect content ratings, only what is shown to more trusted users to ask for a rating. Downvoting sprees from untrusted users will thus be annoying but ineffective.</li>
<li>The site may also suggest to more trusted users that they uprate or downrate particular users.</li>
<li>The exact algorithms by which the site rates content, hands trust to users, or asks users for moderation would probably want plenty of tweaking. Machine learning could help here. However, for an MVP something pretty simple would likely get the site off the ground easily.</li>

<p>We’ll be meeting to give and listen to very short talks!</p>

<p>We’ll do 7-minute lightning talks with 3 additional minutes allowed for questions. We’ll also limit the number of programming-related talks to no more than half of all talks, in order to promote variety. A talk doesn’t have to be formal, planned, or even something that you’d expect someone to Give A Talk About; it can be as simple as telling the group about something you find interesting or cool. In the past, we’ve had people talk about topics like: how complicated the process of organizing fresh food for airplane flights is, their experience volunteering for a local political campaign, a video game they were designing and writing, and many others.</p>

<p>We don't expect any sort of preparation or practice for these kinds of talks. They're very casual and the expectations are low. If your talk isn't great, it's okay because we'll just move on to another one in a few minutes. If it helps, think of it this way: you're just being given the conversational floor for a few minutes, in a slightly more organized way than usual.</p>

<p>For help getting into the building, please call (or text, with a likely-somewhat-slower response rate): three zero one, three five six, five four two four.</p>

<p><strong>Format:</strong></p>

<p>We meet and start hanging out at 6:15, but don’t officially start doing the meetup topic until 6:45-7 to accommodate stragglers. Usually there is a food order that goes out before we start the meetup topic.</p>

<p><strong>About these meetups:</strong></p>

<p>The mission of the SF LessWrong meetup is to provide a fun, low-key social space with some structured interaction, where new and non-new community members can mingle and have interesting conversations. Everyone is welcome.</p>

<p>We explicitly encourage people to split off from the main conversation or diverge from the topic if that would be more fun for them (moving side conversations into a separate part of the space if appropriate). Meetup topics are here as a tool to facilitate fun interaction, and we certainly don’t want them to inhibit it.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE: This will be the last SF Meetup of 2016.</strong></p></div>

<p style=""color: #444444; font-family: Georgia, &quot;Bitstream Charter&quot;, serif; line-height: 1.5; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;"">Scenario 1: you post on facebook ""This month I want to lose 1kg, I am worried I can't do it - you guys should show me support"". Your friends; being the best of aspiring rationalist friends; believe your instructions are thought out and planned, After all your goal is Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic and Timely (<a style=""color: #743399; line-height: 1.5;"" href=""https://www.projectsmart.co.uk/smart-goals.php"">SMART</a>). In the interest of complying with your request you get 17 likes and 10 comments of ""wow awesome"" and ""you go man"" and ""that's the way to do it"". Even longer ones of, ""good planning will help you achieve your goals"", and some guy saying how he lost 2 kilos in a month, so 1kg should be easy as cake.</p>
<p style=""color: #444444; font-family: Georgia, &quot;Bitstream Charter&quot;, serif; line-height: 1.5; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;"">When you read all the posts your brain goes ""wow, lost weight like that"", ""earn't the adoration of my friends for doing the thing"", and rewards you dopamine for your social support. &nbsp;I feel great! So you have a party, eat what you like, relax and enjoy that feeling. One month later you managed to&nbsp;<strong style=""color: #000000; line-height: 1.5;"">gain</strong>&nbsp;a kilo not lose one.</p>

So all of you better hold me to that, and help me get there"". In the interest of complying with you, all your aspiring rationalist friends post things like, ""Yea right"", ""I'll believe it when I see it"". ""you couldn't do 1kg last month, what makes you think you can do it now?"", ""I predict he will lose one kilo but then put it back on again. haha"", ""you're so full of it. You want to lose weight; I expect to see you running with me at 8am 3 times a week"". two weeks later someone posts to your wall, ""hows the weight loss going? I think you failed already"", and two people comment, ""I bet he did"", and ""actually he did come running in the morning"".</p>
<p style=""color: #444444; font-family: Georgia, &quot;Bitstream Charter&quot;, serif; line-height: 1.5; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;"">When you read all the posts your brain goes; ""looks like I gotta prove it to them that I can do this, and hey this could be easy if they help me exercise"", no dopamine reward because I didn't get the acclaim. After two weeks you are starting to lose track of the initial momentum, the chocolate is starting to move to the front of the cupboard again. When you see the post on your wall you double down; throw out the chocolate so it's not in your temptation, and message the runner that you will be there tomorrow. After a month you actually did it, reporting back to your friends they actually congratulate you for your work; ""my predictions were wrong; updating my beliefs"", ""congratulations"", ""teach me how you did it""..</p>

<p style=""color: #444444; font-family: Georgia, &quot;Bitstream Charter&quot;, serif; line-height: 1.5; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;"">Given that in scenario 2 asking for help yielded an exercise partner, and scenario 1 only yielded encouragement - there is a clear distinction between useful goal-sharing and less-useful goal sharing.</p>

<p><em>This post continues the research programme of attacking the grain of truth problem by departure from the Bayesian paradigm. In the <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1046"">previous post</a>, I suggested using Savage's minimax regret decision rule, but here I fall back to the simple minimax decision rule. This is because the mathematics is considerably simpler, and minimax should be sufficient to get IUD play in general games and Nash equilibrium in zero-sum two-player games. I hope to build on these results to get analogous results for minimax regret in the future.</em></p>
<p>We consider ""semi-Bayesian"" agents following the minimax expected utility decision rule, in oblivious environments with full monitoring (a setting that we will refer to as ""forecasting""). This setting is considered in order to avoid the need to enforce exploration, as a preparation for analysis of general environments. We show that such agents satisfy a certain asymptotic optimality theorem. Intuitively, this theorem means that whenever the environment satisfies an incomplete model that is included in the prior, the agent will eventually learn this model i.e. extract at least as much utility as can be guaranteed for this model.</p>

It&rsquo;s closely connected to the 80/20 principle: it&rsquo;s when you only have control over that last 20%, but you pretend it&rsquo;s the whole thing and work on it accordingly.

I agree with this goal and want to help.&nbsp;There are reasons to think that we need not only public discourse, but public fora. One reason is that there's value specifically in having a public set of&nbsp;<em>canonical writing</em>&nbsp;that members of an intellectual community are expected to have read. Another is that writers want to be heard, and on fora where people can easily comment, it's easier to tell whether people are listening and benefiting from your writing.</p>

<p style=""line-height: 1.71429; margin: 0px 0px 1.71429rem;"">For one rather public and hilarious example, witness&nbsp;<a style=""color: #21759b; outline: none;"" href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/"">Scott Alexander&rsquo;s&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;flight from LessWrong to LiveJournal to a personal blog to Twitter and Tumblr, in hopes that somewhere he can find a place isolated enough that nobody will notice his insight and humor.

<p style=""line-height: 1.71429; margin: 0px 0px 1.71429rem;"">A blog is almost a perfect medium for personal accountability. It belongs to&nbsp;<em>you</em>, not your employer, and not the hivemind. &nbsp;The archives are easily searchable. The posts are permanently viewable. Everything embarrassing you&rsquo;ve ever written is there. &nbsp;If there&rsquo;s a comment section, people are free to come along and poke holes in your posts. This leaves people vulnerable in a certain way. Not just to trolls, but to&nbsp;<em>critics</em>.</p>

<p style=""line-height: 1.71429; margin: 0px 0px 1.71429rem;"">We talk a lot about social media killing privacy, but there&rsquo;s also a way in which it kills&nbsp;<em>publicness,&nbsp;</em>by allowing people to curate their spaces by personal friend groups, and retreat from open discussions. &nbsp; In a public square, any rando can ask an aristocrat to explain himself. &nbsp;If people hide from public squares, they can&rsquo;t be exposed to Socrates&rsquo; questions.</p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.71429; margin: 0px 0px 1.71429rem;"">I suspect that, especially for people who are even minor VIPs (my level of online fame, while modest, is enough to create some of this effect), it&rsquo;s tempting to become&nbsp;<em>less available&nbsp;</em>to the &ldquo;public&rdquo;, less willing to engage with strangers, even those who seem friendly and interesting. &nbsp;I think it&rsquo;s worth fighting this temptation. &nbsp;You don&rsquo;t get the gains of open discussion if you close yourself off. &nbsp;You may not capture all the gains yourself, but that&rsquo;s how the tragedy of the commons works; a bunch of people have to cooperate and trust if they&rsquo;re going to build good stuff together. &nbsp;And what that means, concretely, on the margin, is taking more time to explain yourself and engage intellectually with people who, from your perspective, look dumb, clueless, crankish, or uncool.</p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.71429; margin: 0px 0px 1.71429rem;"">Some of the people I admire most, including theoretical computer scientist&nbsp;<a style=""color: #21759b; outline: none;"" href=""http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/"">Scott Aaronson</a>, are notable for taking the time to carefully debunk crackpots (and offer them the benefit of the doubt in case they are in fact correct.) &nbsp;Is this activity a great ROI for a brilliant scientist, from a narrowly selfish perspective? &nbsp;No. But it&rsquo;s praiseworthy, because it contributes to a truly open discussion. If scientists take the time to investigate weird claims from randos, they&rsquo;re doing the work of proving that science is a universal and systematic way of thinking, not just an elite club of insiders. &nbsp;In the long run, it&rsquo;s very important that somebody be doing that groundwork.</p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.71429; margin: 0px 0px 1.71429rem;"">Talking about interesting things, with friendly strangers, in a spirit of welcoming open discussion and accountability rather than fleeing from it, seems really underappreciated today, and I think it&rsquo;s time to make an explicit push towards building places online that have that quality.</p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.71429; margin: 0px 0px 1.71429rem;"">In that spirit, I&rsquo;d like to recommend&nbsp;<a style=""color: #21759b; outline: none;"" href=""/"">LessWrong</a>&nbsp;to my readers. For those not familiar with it, it&rsquo;s a discussion forum devoted to things like cognitive science, AI, and related topics, and, back in its heyday a few years ago, it was&nbsp;<em>suffused&nbsp;</em>with the nerdy-discussion-nature. It had all the enthusiasm of late-night dorm-room philosophy discussions &mdash; except that some of the people you&rsquo;d be having the discussions with were among the most creative people of our generation. &nbsp;These days, posting and commenting is a lot sparser, and the energy is gone, but I and some other old-timers are trying to rekindle it. I&rsquo;m crossposting all my blog posts there from now on, and I encourage everyone to check out and join the discussions there.</p>

<p>I agree that we need to move more discussion back into enduring public media so that we can make stable intellectual progress, and outsiders can catch up if they have something to contribute - especially if we're wrong about something they know about. And Anna Salamon's also&nbsp;<a style=""color: #21759b; outline: none;"" href=""/lw/o5z/on_the_importance_of_less_wrong_or_another_single/"">suggested</a>&nbsp;that common fora such as LessWrong are an especially important means of creating a single conversation:</p>
<blockquote style=""margin: 0px; padding: 1.71429rem; color: #444444; font-family: &quot;Open Sans&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: italic !important;"">
<p style=""line-height: 1.71429; margin: 0px 0px 1.71429rem;"">We need to think about [...]&nbsp;everything to do with understanding what the heck kind of a place the world is, such that that kind of place may contain cheat codes and trap doors toward achieving an existential win. We probably also need to think about ""ways of thinking"" -- both the individual thinking skills, and the community conversational norms, that can cause our puzzle-solving to work better.</p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.71429; margin: 0px 0px 1.71429rem;"">One feature that is pretty helpful here, is if we somehow maintain a single ""conversation"", rather than a bunch of people separately having thoughts and sometimes taking inspiration from one another. By ""a conversation"", I mean a space where people can e.g. reply to one another; rely on shared jargon/shorthand/concepts; build on arguments that have been established in common as probably-valid; point out apparent errors and then have that pointing-out be actually taken into account or else replied-to).</p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.71429; margin: 0px 0px 1.71429rem;"">One feature that really helps things be ""a conversation"" in this way, is if there is a single Schelling set of posts/etc. that people (in the relevant community/conversation) are supposed to read, and can be assumed to have read. Less Wrong used to be a such place; right now there is no such place; it seems to me highly desirable to form a new such place if we can.</p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.71429; margin: 0px 0px 1.71429rem;"">We have lately ceased to have a ""single conversation"" in this way. Good content is still being produced across these communities, but there is no single locus of conversation, such that if you're in a gathering of e.g. five aspiring rationalists, you can take for granted that of course everyone has read posts such-and-such. There is no one place you can post to, where, if enough people upvote your writing, people will reliably read and respond (rather than ignore), and where others will call them out if they later post reasoning that ignores your evidence. Without such a locus, it is hard for conversation to build in the correct way. (And hard for it to turn into arguments and replies, rather than a series of non sequiturs.)</p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.71429; margin: 0px 0px 1.71429rem;"">It seems to me, moreover, that Less Wrong used to be such a locus, and that it is worth seeing whether Less Wrong or some similar such place[3] may be a viable locus again.&nbsp;[...]</p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.71429; margin: 0px 0px 1.71429rem;"">I suspect that most of the value generation from having a single shared conversational locus is not captured by the individual generating the value (I suspect there is much distributed value from having ""a conversation"" with better structural integrity / more coherence, but that the value created thereby is pretty distributed). Insofar as there are ""externalized benefits"" to be had by blogging/commenting/reading from a common platform, it may make sense to regard oneself as exercising civic virtue by doing so, and to deliberately do so as one of the uses of one's ""make the world better"" effort. (At least if we can build up toward in fact having a single locus.)</p>

<p>My initial thinking was that we should just move from the ephemeral medium of Facebook to people having their own personal blogs. The nice thing about a blogosphere as a mode of discourse is that community boundaries aren't a huge deal - if you think someone's unhelpful, there's nowhere you have to boot them out from - you just stop reading their stuff and linking them. But this interferes with the&nbsp;&nbsp;""single canon"" approach.</p>

<p>When I hear people talk about getting communities to read the same things, they often bring up very different sorts of benefits. So far I count three very different things they mean:</p>
<ol style=""margin: 0px 0px 1.71429rem; line-height: 1.71429; padding: 0px; color: #444444; font-family: &quot;Open Sans&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;"">

<p>Some have pointed to LessWrong's&nbsp;<a style=""color: #21759b; outline: none;"" href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Sequences"">Sequences</a>&nbsp;- a series of blog posts by Eliezer Yudkowsky on the art of human rationality - as an example of the kind of text that should be a community canon. I do think that the extended LessWrong community has benefited from internalizing the insights&nbsp;laid out in the Sequences. Lots of cognitive wasted motions common elsewhere seem less common in this&nbsp;community because we&nbsp;know better.</p>
<p>This kind of canon plays an analogous role to professional training among, say, engineers - or in a&nbsp;<a style=""color: #21759b; outline: none;"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_arts_education"">liberal arts education</a>. You don't necessarily expect a liberally educated person to know each particular book you reference, but you do expect them to know what math, and music, and literature, and philosophy are like on the inside. Not every ""liberal arts college"" does this anymore, but some still do, and&nbsp;people who get it can recognize each other and have conversations that are simply&nbsp;unavailable between us and people without that background. Not because the material is impossible to communicate, but because there are way too many steps, and because it's not just about getting across a particular argument. It's about different ways of perceiving the world.</p>
<p>Similarly,&nbsp;if I'm talking to someone who has read and understood the Sequences, there are places we can go, quickly, that it might take a long time to explore with someone else who hasn't stumbled across the same insights elsewhere.</p>
<p>This benefit from having a canon requires a substantial investment. For this reason, taking an existing community and pushing a canon on it seems unlikely to work very well without a very large investment. Traditional Western academia did this for a while, but that depended on the authority of existing&nbsp;elite scholars, and a large, hierarchical system that had a near monopoly on literacy and concomitant employment. Judaism seems in some large part formed by its canon, but the process that knit together a tight literary core ended up interposing layers of commentary beginning with the written Talmud in between Jews and the text of the Bible itself.</p>
<p>Taking a canon and forming a community around it, composed of people who find it compelling, seems more tractable right now. LessWrong coalesced around the Sequences (and later, the CFAR workshops). Objectivism coalesced around&nbsp;<em>The Fountainhead</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Atlas Shrugged</em>. My alma mater,&nbsp;<a style=""color: #21759b; outline: none;"" href=""https://www.sjc.edu/"">St. John's College</a>, reformed as a community around the&nbsp;<a style=""color: #21759b; outline: none;"" href=""https://www.sjc.edu/academic-programs/undergraduate"">New (Great Books) Program</a>&nbsp;and the students and tutors it attracted.</p>
<p>This suggests to me that the thing to do is to&nbsp;figure out how to teach the skills and norms you want in your community, and see who joins.</p>
<h2 style=""clear: both; line-height: 1.6; margin: 1.71429rem 0px; font-size: 1.28571rem; color: #444444; font-family: &quot;Open Sans&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"">The shoulders of giants</h2>
<p>A second reason for a canon is so that we don't have to retreat old ground. This is not so much about the unarticulated, holistic seeing that comes from having read a corpus of text&nbsp;together, but from having common knowledge of specific accumulated insights.</p>
<p>This is why academics publish in journals, and typically begin papers by reviewing (and citing)&nbsp;prior work on the subject. The academic journal model does not really depend at all for published&nbsp;discourse&nbsp;on having a single uniform canon. Instead, it relies on common availability of prior sources. A norm of citing, linking, or otherwise directing the reader to prior work is&nbsp;more adaptable to this purpose, because it does not so fully exclude outsiders as a community where everyone is expected to have already learned the thing.</p>
<p>I've tried to follow something like these practices myself, linking to prior work on a subject that's influenced me when I'm aware of it. Much of the Rationalist and EA blogosphere works on this model at least sometimes. But I can think of one thing that could be useful for the academic journal model that doesn't yet exist in the Rationalist or EA communities: a stable archive of prior work, that brings the different sources together - blog posts, academic papers, and personal web pages that advance the Rationalist project. Right now, there's no search capability here, no&nbsp;<a style=""color: #21759b; outline: none;"" href=""https://scholar.google.com/"">Google Scholar</a>&nbsp;equivalent to look up ""works citing this one"" or ""works cited by this one."" (If you want to advance this project, let me know if you want me to put you in touch with others interested in making this happen.)</p>
<h2 style=""clear: both; line-height: 1.6; margin: 1.71429rem 0px; font-size: 1.28571rem; color: #444444; font-family: &quot;Open Sans&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"">Synchronized discussions</h2>
<p>When a TV show becomes popular, people who like it often come together to watch it, or discuss each episode, sharing their reactions to it and speculating about characters' motivations or what will happen next. This sort of agenda-setting makes it much easier to have large, complex conversations about such things, while the text (in this case, the episode) is still fresh in everyone's mind. Serialized stories such as&nbsp;<a style=""color: #21759b; outline: none;"" href=""http://unsongbook.com/"">Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality</a>, or the original&nbsp;<em>Harry Potter</em>&nbsp;series, or&nbsp;<a style=""color: #21759b; outline: none;"" href=""http://unsongbook.com/"">Unsong</a>, have a similar coordinating effect. If your community's largely following the same texts&nbsp;at the same time, then when you meet a stranger at a party, you don't get stuck talking about the weather.</p>
<p>Getting everyone looking at the same thing at the same time can also spark&nbsp;productive disagreement. If something will be out in public forever, you can put off commenting on it. But if now's the time for everyone to talk about it, now's your only chance to speak up if&nbsp;<a style=""color: #21759b; outline: none;"" href=""https://xkcd.com/386/"">someone is wrong on the internet</a>.</p>
<h1 style=""clear: both; line-height: 1.5; margin: 1.71429rem 0px; font-size: 1.5rem; color: #444444; font-family: &quot;Open Sans&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"">Tiers and volleys</h1>
<p>The synchronization of conversations can be a powerful force for extracting additional value from the intellectual labor people are already doing, and getting them to share their perspectives more promptly and publicly. But if an intellectual community doesn't have people going off on their own, doing self-directed work of the kind that can lead to more academic&nbsp;journal style discourse, then it won't produce deep original work of the kind that may be needed to steer the world in a substantially better direction.</p>
<p>Creating a sort of community ""TV show"" and a forum for people to comment on it is the least expensive way to extract additional public value from the intellectual activity already going on.&nbsp;<a style=""color: #21759b; outline: none;"" href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/"">Slate Star Codex</a>&nbsp;has to some degree taken over LessWrong's role as a community hub, and provides a good starting point - its author, Scott Alexander, was kind enough to link to a few posts in the attempted LessWrong renaissance, and perhaps will do so again if and when that or some similar effort shows substantially more progress. But I don't expect this on its own to lead to the kind of deep intellectual progress we need.</p>
<p>Some people are already doing work at something more like an academic tempo, doing a fair amount of research on their own, and sharing what they find afterwards. Building a better archive/repository of existing work seems like it could substantially increase the impact of the work people are already doing. And if done well, it could lead to an increase in truly generative, deep work - and maybe even more importantly, less progress lost to the sands of time.</p>
<p>I expect building something like academic journals for the community, and persuading more people to do this sort of intellectual labor, to be substantially slower work, at least if done right, and it will only be worth it if done right. It will require many people to invest substantial intellectual effort, though hopefully they'd want to think deeply about things anyway.</p>
<p>Creating a common conceptual vocabulary, skills, and norms,&nbsp;by contrast, can be very expensive. A full-blown liberal arts education is famously pricey. The Sequences took a year of Eliezer Yudkowsky's time, and I don't think he worked on much else. CFAR has several full-time employees who've been working at it for years. This approach - especially the high-touch version where you educate people in person - is to be used sparingly, when you have a strong reason to believe that you can produce a large improvement that way.</p>

We hear that people are trapped in <a href=""https://www.ted.com/talks/eli_pariser_beware_online_filter_bubbles"">filter bubbles</a> that <a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/05/06/the-future-is-filters/"">limit their exposure</a> to <a href=""https://putanumonit.com/2016/11/07/the-day-after-tomorrow/"">varying opinions</a> and that <a href=""http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/pew-study-finds-polarized-americans-increasingly-resistant-political-compromise/"">America is more divided than ever</a> thanks to modern media <a href=""https://meaningness.com/metablog/political-understanding-stages"">enabling our tribalism</a>. And although I suspect we are primarily seeing a return to normal levels of tribalism from the unusual dream time of cosmopolitanism enabled by recent mass migration to cities that <a href=""https://www.census.gov/population/censusdata/table-4.pdf"">ended in the 1970s</a>, there is a deeper source of divide found in the structure of our public conversations that lies beneath the stormy seas of politics.</p><p>Specifically, most public political discussion is debate. News programs do this explicitly both when they organize formal debates between candidates and everyday when they ask experts to argue policy. Politicians and experts also do this implicitly when they give solo speeches by speaking in the context of what others have said and arguing for their positions against others. And given how politicians and experts are often criticized for going &#x201C;off point&#x201D; when they fail to maximize their opportunities to argue for their positions, it seems there is little room for anything other than debate in political discourse.</p><p>A similar pattern exists outside politics. Professors debate contentious academic topics. Theologians contest the fine points of religion. Lawyers argue cases to convince judges and juries. People even debate against themselves by making pro/con lists. All of these are attempts to find the truth, to understand reality as it is, and all do so through adversarial talk.</p><p>If this is what you&#x2019;re used to this probably seems normal, but there is a fundamental problem with seeking truth through debate. To understand why, consider what&#x2019;s happening in debate from a <a href=""https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/papers/2008/P7336.pdf"">game theoretic</a> perspective. Two parties, A and B, are presenting information to a third party, C, who will use the information to develop beliefs. The payout is something like this: C wins if C ends up with true beliefs; A wins if C adopts A&#x2019;s beliefs, and B wins if C adopts B&#x2019;s beliefs. The game is not zero-sum: if A&#x2019;s beliefs are true then C and A can win; likewise B and C can both win. But if we ignore C&#x2019;s payout, the game is zero-sum: A or B or both must lose and at most one can win. This informs the <a href=""http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2016/12/08/the-strategy-of-subversive-conflict/"">strategies</a> that A and B take.</p><p>The best situation if you are A or B is to have true beliefs. Unfortunately <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemology/"">this is hard</a>. And although for simplicity here I talk about &#x201C;true&#x201D; beliefs, in fact we should be talking more about how closely a belief corresponds to reality and talk about winning more or less depending on the strength of the correspondence. So really what we should expect if we are A or B is to have somewhat true beliefs where we&#x2019;re not even sure how true our own belief&#x2019;s are. That&#x2019;s the kind of situation in which the debate game has to be played.</p><p>Even if A and B were aware of how true their own beliefs are, the structure of the game still encourages them to play to win with known false beliefs such that either A or B is the only winner. In such a scenario C is not necessarily even helped by A and B; C must try to win despite A and Bs&#x2019; attempts to persuade them. This is the problem with debate: it can work, but its structure ensures that it will mostly diverge from the ideal case and create a game where A and B will actively try to make C lose. This is, in short, a very ineffective way of trying to understand reality if your goal is true beliefs.</p><p>The game of debate forces its interlocutors into <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivated_reasoning"">motivated reasoning</a>, an attempt to find a plausible explanation for conclusions already determined rather than an attempt reason out a conclusion. Motivated reasoning skews our view of reality towards what we wish was true was rather than what is. Surely we can approach collaborative understanding of the mundane world around us without resorting to rationalization.</p><p>A debate is <a href=""http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=debate"">etymologically</a> a fight. It&#x2019;s a kind of dialogue or &#x201C;<a href=""http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=dialogue"">across speech</a>&#x201D; that puts the participants against one another. If I were to be so bold as to define a new term, debate is a kind of dislogue or &#x201C;against speech&#x201D;. What we want instead is dialogue that brings participants together through logical reasoning. What we want is <a href=""http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=dialectic"">dialectic</a>.</p><p>Dialectic is philosophical, rational speech aimed and addressing contradiction. Rather than trying to resolve disagreements, though, it accepts them as a source of developing deeper understanding. Through repeated acceptance of contradiction, or <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aufheben"">aufhaben</a>, it grows comprehension towards a completeness that incorporates both thesis and antithesis.</p><p>That&#x2019;s all a bit abstract, though, so here&#x2019;s an example of a dialectic. While watching it, notice how negation advances understanding rather than contracting it.</p><p>At each turn of the narrative, a negation of a previous conclusion arises that leads us to broader understanding. This is nearly the opposite of what happens in debate, where negation is used to drive back competing explanations to create space that can be filled with the speaker&#x2019;s preferred reasoning and conclusions. If debate is a fight, then dialectic is a dance where contradictions partner in graceful harmony.</p><p>But, I anticipate you protesting, isn&#x2019;t this just debating politely? Perhaps the outcome is similar, but the key difference between debate and dialectic is that dialectic is not a game in the game theoretic sense. Even if there are multiple participants in a dialectic, there is no one who can win. The goal is truth, so well as it can be understood, without regard for who helps find it. Dialectic makes no space for individual credit, so it removes the payout matrix and replaces it with a single payoff shared by all.</p><p><strong><em>This of course means that we must still debate.</em></strong></p><p>For although dialectic offers a better way to reconcile differences in approaching the truth, nearly everyone is incentivized to (meta)defect and turn dialectic into debate. Unless you are <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hegel-dialectics/"">like Hegel</a> and <a href=""http://www.overcomingbias.com/2016/06/caplan-audits-age-of-em.html"">ask to be judged by your own methods</a>, you will have greater prestige if more people adopt beliefs like yours because you argued for them. So if there is nothing to guard against it, there is incentive to defect and treat dialectic as a game, and then to defect a little in dialectic to gain a little prestige but still mostly get at the truth. But defection begets defection, the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium#Stability"">balance is broken</a>, and we soon find ourselves back at the equilibrium of debate.</p><p>But if debaters still care about the truth, perhaps because they are both participant in and judge of the debate, there may be ways to work within the game to produce more winning outcomes. One such approach, the &#x201C;<a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/o6p/double_crux_a_strategy_for_resolving_disagreement/"">double crux</a>&#x201D;, is how fellow Map and Territory contributor <a href=""https://medium.com/u/afd4fe84e81b"">Duncan A Sabien</a> tries to improve debate.</p><p>As for me, I ironically find myself soldiering on in a campaign to engage in dialectic despite the forces of reality opposing my choice. In doing so I <a href=""https://mapandterritory.org/revealed-and-stated-identity-64c6ec070f4f"">reveal a preference</a> for truth over prestige, perhaps making dialectic <a href=""https://mapandterritory.org/fluid-decision-making-d8e4e41a51c0#.xo0tq2es8"">natural</a> for me anyway.</p>",gworley,gordon-seidoh-worley,Gordon Seidoh Worley,

</ul>
<p>In the days since we published <a href=""/lw/o7o/cfars_new_focus_and_ai_safety/"">our previous post</a>, a number of people have come up to me and expressed concerns about our new mission. &nbsp;Several of these had the form &ldquo;I, too, think that AI safety is incredibly important &mdash; and that is why I think CFAR should remain cause-neutral, so it can bring in more varied participants who might be made wary by an explicit focus on AI.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I would here like to reply to these people and others, and to clarify what is and isn&rsquo;t entailed by our new focus on AI safety.<a id=""more""></a></p>
<div>
<h1>First: Where are CFAR&rsquo;s activities affected by the cause(s) it chooses to prioritize?</h1>
<div>The question of which causes CFAR aims to help (via its rationality training) plugs into our day-to-day activities in at least 4 ways:</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>1) &nbsp;<strong>It affects which people we target.</strong> &nbsp;If AI safety is our aim, we must then backchain from &ldquo;Who is likely both to impact AI safety better if they have more rationality skills, and also to be able to train rationality skills with us?&rdquo; to who to target with specialized workshops.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>2) <strong>It affects which rationality skills we prioritize</strong>. &nbsp;AI safety work benefits from the ability to reason about abstract, philosophically confusing issues (notably: AI); which presumably benefits from various rationality skills. &nbsp;Competitive marathon running probably also benefits from certain rationality skills; but they are probably different ones. &nbsp; Designing an &ldquo;art of rationality&rdquo; that can support work on AI safety is different from designing an &ldquo;art of rationality&rdquo; for some other cause. &nbsp;(Although see point C, below.)</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>3) &nbsp;<strong>It affects what metrics or feedback systems we make interim use of, and how we evaluate our work.</strong> &nbsp;If &ldquo;AI safety via rationality training&rdquo; is the mission, then &ldquo;person X produced work A that looks existential risk-reducing on our best guess, and X says they would&rsquo;ve been less able to do A without us&rdquo; is the obvious proxy measure of whether we&rsquo;re having impact. &nbsp;If we have this measure, we can use our measurements of it to steer.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>4) <strong>It affects explicit curriculum at AI-related or EA-related events.</strong> &nbsp;E.g., it affects whether we&rsquo;re allowed to run events at which participants <a href=""/lw/o6p/double_crux_a_strategy_for_resolving_disagreement/"">double crux</a> about AI safety, and whether we&rsquo;re allowed to present arguments from Bostrom&rsquo;s Superintelligence without also presenting a commensurate amount of analysis of global poverty interventions.</div>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
<div>In addition to the above four effects, it has traditionally also affected: 5) what causes/opinions CFAR staff feel free to talk about when speaking informally to participants at workshops or otherwise representing CFAR. &nbsp;(We used to try not to bring up such subjects.)</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>One thing to notice, here, is that CFAR&rsquo;s mission doesn&rsquo;t just affect our external face; it affects the details of our day-to-day activities. &nbsp;(Or at minimum, it <em>should</em> affect these.) &nbsp;It is therefore very important that our mission be: (a) actually important; (b) simple, intelligible, and usable by our staff on a day-to-day basis; (c) corresponding to a detailed (and, ideally, accurate) model in the heads of at least a few CFARians doing strategy (or, better, in all CFARians), so that the details of what we&rsquo;re doing can in fact &ldquo;<a href=""http://www.yudkowsky.net/rational/virtues#the-void"">cut through</a>&rdquo; to reducing existential risk.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>So, okay, we just looked concretely at how CFAR&rsquo;s mission (and, in particular, its prioritization of AI safety) can affect its day-to-day choices.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>It&rsquo;s natural next to ask what upsides people were hoping for from a (previous or imagined) &ldquo;cause neutral&rdquo; CFAR, and to discuss which of those upsides we can access still, and which we can&rsquo;t. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll start with the ones we can do.</div>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
<h1>Some components that people may be hoping for from &ldquo;cause neutral&rdquo;, that we can do, and that we intend to do:</h1>
<div><strong>A. &nbsp;For students of all intellectual vantage points, we can make a serious effort to be &ldquo;epistemically trustworthy relative to their starting point&rdquo;.</strong></div>
<div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>By this I mean:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We can be careful to include all information that <em>they, from their vantage point, would want to know</em> -- even if on our judgment, some of the information is misleading or irrelevant, or might pull them to the &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; conclusions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Similarly, we can attempt to expose people to skilled thinkers they would want to talk with, regardless of those thinkers&rsquo; viewpoints; and we can be careful to allow <em>their own thoughts, values, and arguments to develop</em>, regardless of which &ldquo;side&rdquo; this may lead to them supporting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More generally, we can and should attempt to cooperate with each student&rsquo;s extrapolated volition, and to treat the student as <em>they</em> (from their initial epistemic vantage point; and with their initial values) would wish to be treated. &nbsp;Which is to say that we should not do anything that would work less well <a href=""https://sideways-view.com/2016/11/14/integrity-for-consequentialists/"">if the algorithm behind it were known</a>, and that we should attempt to run such workshops (and to have such conversations, and so on) as would cause good people of varied initial views to stably on reflection want to participate in them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div>
<div>In asserting this commitment, I do not mean to assert that others should believe this of us; only that we will aim to do it. &nbsp;You are welcome to stare skeptically at us about potential biases; we will not take offense; it is probably prudent. &nbsp;Also, our execution will doubtless have flaws; still, we&rsquo;ll appreciate it if people point such flaws out to us.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
<div><strong>B. &nbsp;We can deal forthrightly and honorably with potential allies who have different views about what is important.</strong></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>That is: we can be clear and explicit about the values and beliefs we are basing CFAR&rsquo;s actions on, and we can attempt to negotiate clearly and explicitly with individuals who are interested in supporting particular initiatives, but who disagree with us about other parts of our priorities.[1]</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
<div><strong>C. &nbsp;We can create new &ldquo;art of rationality&rdquo; content at least partly via broad-based exploratory play &mdash; &nbsp;and thus reduce the odds that our &ldquo;art of rationality&rdquo; ends up in a local optimum around one specific application.</strong>&nbsp;</div>
<div>That is: we can follow Feynman&rsquo;s lead and <a href=""https://www.physics.ohio-state.edu/~kilcup/262/feynman.html"">notice and chase &ldquo;spinning plates&rdquo;</a>. &nbsp;We can bring in new material by bringing in folks with very different skillsets, and seeing what happens to our art and theirs when we attempt to translate things into one another&rsquo;s languages. &nbsp;We can play; and we can nourish an applied rationality community that can also play.</div>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
<h1>Some components that people may be hoping for from &ldquo;cause neutral&rdquo;, that we can&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t do:</h1>
<div><strong>i. Appear to have no viewpoints, in hopes of attracting people who don&rsquo;t trust those with our viewpoints.</strong></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>We can&rsquo;t do this one. &nbsp;Both CFAR as an entity and individual CFAR staff, do in fact have viewpoints; there is no high-integrity way to mask that fact. &nbsp;Also, &ldquo;integrity&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t a window-dressing that one pastes onto a thing, or a nicety that one can compromise for the sake of results; &ldquo;integrity&rdquo; is a word for the basic agreements that make it possible for groups of people to work together while stably trusting one another. &nbsp;Integrity is thus structurally necessary if we are to get anything done at all.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>All we can do is do our best to *be* trustworthy in our dealings with varied people, and assume that image will eventually track substance. &nbsp;(And if image doesn&rsquo;t, we can look harder at our substance, see if we may still be subtly acting in bad faith, and try again. &nbsp;Integrity happens from the inside out.)</div>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
<div><strong>ii. Leave our views or plans stalled or vague, in cases where having a particular viewpoint would expose us to possibly being wrong (or to possibly alienating those who disagree).</strong></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Again, we can&rsquo;t do this one; organizations need a clear plan for their actions to have any chance at either: i) working; or ii) banging into data and allowing one to notice that the plan was wrong. &nbsp;Flinching from clearly and visibly held views is the mother of wasting time. &nbsp;(Retaining a willingness to say &ldquo;Oops!&rdquo; and change course is, however, key.)</div>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
<div><strong>iii. Emphasize all rationality use cases evenly. &nbsp;Cause all people to be evenly targeted by CFAR workshops.</strong></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>We can&rsquo;t do this one either; we are too small to pursue all opportunities without horrible dilution and failure to capitalize on the most useful opportunities.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>We are presently targeting all workshops at either: (a) folks who are more likely than usual to directly impact existential risk; or (b) folks who will add to a robust rationality community, and/or (c) allow us to learn more about the art (e.g., by having a different mix of personalities, skills, or backgrounds than most folks here).</div>
<div><br /></div>

<div><span id=""docs-internal-guid-91d9049f-e795-fd8e-940d-905ef4e716a2"">
<p>[1] In my opinion, I goofed this up historically in several instances, most notably with respect to Val and Julia, who joined CFAR in 2012 with the intention to create a cause-neutral rationality organization. &nbsp;Most integrity-gaps are caused by lack of planning rather than strategic deviousness; someone tells their friend they&rsquo;ll have a project done by Tuesday and then just&hellip; doesn&rsquo;t. &nbsp;My mistakes here seem to me to be mostly of this form. &nbsp;In any case, I expect the task to be much easier, and for me and CFAR to do better, now that we have a simpler and clearer mission.</p>

<p>The asymptotic optimality theorem for minimax we proved <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1107"">previously</a> was formulated in terms of the ""optimal value"" <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""{v(x)}""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-texatom""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">v</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">(</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">x</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">)</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>. Compared to the Bayesian case, <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""{v(x)}""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-texatom""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">v</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">(</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">x</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">)</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> has the strange property that its definition depends on rewards other than those received after observing <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""{x}""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-texatom""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">x</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>. This is a direct consequence of the dynamic inconsistency of minimax. In an attempt to get around this, we show that the minimax decision rule is dynamically consistent in a certain special case and demonstrate that this special case can occur often for a natural class of models. However, this doesn't immediately solve the problem: doing so requires replacing the minimax decision rule by a stronger condition that ensures subgame perfection in some sense. The formalization of the latter idea is left for future posts.</p>

<p>Managed to accidentally forget to post it on lesswrong.</p>

<p>In celebration of the holiday season in a way that only scientists can do; I proudly present our 3rd annual secular solstice celebrations!</p>

<p>Iit's the silly season so we get to party too.  Bring a dish! Something tasty... Try to aim for something inclusive of vegetarian/vegan, at the very least - know what is in your dish for when people ask.</p>

<p>Agenda: (in no particular hurry)</p>

<p>• Eat food; be merry!</p>

<p>• Our year in review (as a local community, as a country, as humanity)</p>

<p>• Talk about goals for the past year, share successes and failures (as individuals)</p>

<p>• Lachlan - how to make resolutions for the new year effectively</p>

<p>• Taryn - songs</p>

<p>• Over the next year: plans for ourselves</p>

<p>• Over the next year: predictions about the state of the future of the world</p>

<p>Bonus mini-game: prepare for the Candles VS wind game, and this time bring a solution with you that you can share with others.</p>

<p>Post the dish you plan to bring so we don't get duplicates...</p>

<p>See you there!</p>

<p>p.s. It's a little early for the solstice; we are planning around a few overseas holidays...  The actual solstice is far too close to Christmas so we are hosting early.</p>

<p>If you have trouble - call me on 0438481143</p>

</blockquote>
<p>A lot of my otherwise very smart and thoughtful friends seem to have a mental block around thinking on certain topics, because they're the sort of topics Important People have Important Opinions around. There seem to be two very different reasons for this sort of block:</p>
<ol>
<li>Being wrong feels bad.</li>
<li>They might lose the respect of others.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Be wrong</h1>
<p>If you don't have an opinion, you can hold onto the fantasy that someday, once you figure the thing out, you'll end up having a right opinion. But if you put yourself out there with an opinion that's unmistakably your own, you don't have that excuse anymore.</p>
<p>This is related to the <a href=""http://hotelconcierge.tumblr.com/post/113360634364/the-stanford-marshmallow-prison-experiment"">desire to pass tests</a>. The smart kids go through school and are taught - explicitly or tacitly - that as long as they get good grades they're doing OK, and if they try at all they can get good grades. So when they bump up against a problem that might actually be hard, there's a strong impulse to look away, to redirect to something else. So they do.</p>
<p>You have to understand that this system is not real, it's just a game. In real life you have to be straight-up wrong sometimes. So you may as well get it over with.</p>
<p>If you expect to be wrong when you guess, then you're already wrong, and paying the price for it. As Eugene Gendlin <a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Litany_of_Gendlin"">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>What is true is already so. Owning up to it doesn't make it worse. Not being open about it doesn't make it go away. And because it's true, it is what is there to be interacted with. Anything untrue isn't there to be lived. People can stand what is true, for they are already enduring it.</blockquote>
<p>What you would be mistaken about, you're already mistaken about. Owning up to it doesn't make you any more mistaken. Not being open about it doesn't make it go away.</p>
<p>""You're already ""wrong"" in the sense that your anticipations aren't perfectly aligned with reality. You just haven't put yourself in a situation where you've openly tried to <a href=""/lw/iq/guessing_the_teachers_password/"">guess the teacher's password</a>. But if you want more power over the world, you need to <a href=""/lw/ia/focus_your_uncertainty/ "">focus your uncertainty</a> - and this only reliably makes you righter if you repeatedly test your beliefs. Which means sometimes being wrong, and noticing. (And then, of course, changing your mind.)</p>
<p>Being wrong is how you learn - by testing hypotheses.</p>
<h1>In secret</h1>
<p>Getting used to being wrong - forming the boldest hypotheses your current beliefs can truly justify so that you can correct your model based on the data - is painful and I don't have a good solution to getting over it except to tough it out. But there's a part of the problem we can separate out, which is - the pain of being wrong publicly.</p>
<p>When I attended a Toastmasters club, one of the things I liked a lot about giving speeches there was that the stakes were low in terms of the content. If I were giving a presentation at work, I had to worry about my generic presentation skills, but also whether the way I was presenting it was a good match for my audience, and also whether the idea I was pitching was a good strategic move for the company or my career, and also whether the information I was presenting was accurate. At Toastmasters, all the content-related stakes were gone. No one with the power to promote or fire me was present. Everyone was on my side, and the group was all about helping each other get better. So all I had to think about was the form of my speech.</p>
<p>Once I'd learned some general presentations at Toastmasters, it became easier to give talks where I did care about the content and there were real-world consequences to the quality of the talk. I'd gotten practice on the form of public speaking separately - so now I could relax about that, and just focus on getting the content right.</p>
<p>Similarly, expressing opinions publicly can be stressful because of the work of generating likely hypotheses, and revealing to yourself that you are farther behind in understanding things than you thought - but also because of the perceived social consequences of sounding stupid. You can at least isolate the last factor, by starting out thinking things through in secret. This works by <a href=""https://srconstantin.wordpress.com/2014/10/16/uncertainty-and-confidence/"">separating epistemic uncertainty from social confidence</a>. (This is closely related to the dichotomy between <a href=""http://benjaminrosshoffman.com/respect-status-ability-character/"">social and objective respect</a>.)</p>
<p>Of course, as soon as you can stand to do this in public, that's better - you'll learn faster, you'll get help. But if you're not there yet, this is a step along the way. If the choice is between having private opinions and having none, have private opinions. (Also related: <a href=""https://sideways-view.com/2016/11/26/if-you-cant-lie-to-others-you-must-lie-to-yourself/"">If we can't lie to others, we will lie to ourselves</a>.)</p>
<p>Read and discuss a book on a topic you want to have opinions about, with one trusted friend. Start a secret blog - or just take notes. Practice having opinions at all, that you can be wrong about, before you worry about being accountable for your opinions. One step at a time.</p>

In a passage that could have come from Less Wrong he wrote &ldquo;There is a traditional hostility between rationalism and traditionalism.

I'm going to go out on a limb and say it's an accepted model for the crowd reading this argument. Based on my own casual observations of culture, it's easy (or at least feels easy) to intuitively understand why some cultural rules are formed. It's particularly nice when it's based on something hidden at the time, which we directly observe in the future, like how pork is forbidden by some religions, which we now know is due to trichinosis caused by parasites in pork.</span></p>

If sacrificing people had some impact on the cosmos it wouldn't have been that much weirder than volcanoes. At least at the time.

And again, I'm not trying to take some post-colonialist (I can't believe I used that term) view that 'all cultures are equally valid.'

What, then, is the analogous prediction problem for agents embedded within (and computed by) their environment?<br />&gt; This is the naturalized induction problem , and it is not yet well understood. A good formalization of this problem, on par with Solomonoff&rsquo;s formalization of the computable sequence induction problem, would represent a significant advance in the theory of general reasoning.<br /><br /><br />In Solomonoff&rsquo;s induction, an algorithm learns about the world (modeled as a Turing machine) from observations (modeled as output from that Turing machine). Solomonoff&rsquo;s induction is uncomputable, however there are computable approximations.<br /><br /><br />1) Suggestion of agent design<br /><br />Consider an agent fully embedded in an environment. Every turn, the agent receves one bit of observation and can preform one bit of action. The design we propose for this agent comes in two steps, learning and deciding.<br /><br />1.1) Learning:<br />The agent models the entire wrold, including the agent it self, as one unknown, output only Turing machine. Both observations and the agents own actions, are seen as world outputs. The agent calculate the probability distribution over hypotheses for the entire world, using Solomonoff&rsquo;s induction (computable approximation).<br /><br />This suggestion completely removes any boundary between the agent and the rest of the world, in the agents wold model.<br /><br />1.2) Deciding<br />The agent must also have a decision proses for choosing what action to take. Because the agent model its own actions as deterministic outputs from a complete wold model, we can not use the decision procedure used by Hutter&rsquo;s AXIX. This is not just a problem of counterfactuals. Our agents internal world model has no input channel.<br /><br />Instead we suggest the flowing: For each available action, the agent calculate the expected utility, conditional on observing itself preform that action. The agent chooses the action that gives the highest expected utility. Alternatively, the agent choses semi-randomly, with higher probability for actions that results in higher expected utility.<br /><br />An advantage with this agent design is that the decision process does not have to care about sequences of actions. Instead different possible future actions are accoutered for by separate wold hypotheses. Further more, this naturally takes in to account situations where the agent looses control over its own actions, e.g. if it brakes down. <br /><br /><br />2) Scoring agents<br /><br />Solomonoff&rsquo;s induction is the formal optimal solution to an associated scoring rule. Having a such a scoring rule is useful for testing how well approximation do. (Right?)<br /><br />I don&rsquo;t know what the associated scoring rule would be for this suggestion. Sorry :(<br /><br /><br />3) Measuring utility<br /><br />The decision proses is based on the agent being able to detect utility in any given world hypothesis. This is a very hard problem, which we do not attempt to solve here.</p>",,,,

Average utilitarianism says world B is preferable to world A. This seems counterintuitive as it has less total utility, but what if we reframe the question?</p>
<p>Imagine you are behind a veil of ignorance and you have to choose which world you will be instantiated into, becoming one citizen randomly selected from the population. From this perspective, world B is the obvious choice: even though it has far less total utility than word A, you personally get more utility by being instantiated into world B. This remains true even if world B only has 1 citizen, though most people, presumably, have ""access to good company"" in their utility function.&nbsp;</p>

eSosndJmKT3KmDRt8,Is Caviar a Risk Factor For Being a Millionaire?,is-caviar-a-risk-factor-for-being-a-millionaire,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/eSosndJmKT3KmDRt8/is-caviar-a-risk-factor-for-being-a-millionaire,2016-12-09T16:27:14.760Z,67,42,9,False,False,,"<p>Today, my paper ""Is caviar a risk factor for being a millionaire?"" was published in the Christmas Edition of the BMJ (formerly the British Medical Journal). &nbsp;The paper is available at http://www.bmj.com/content/355/bmj.i6536 but it is unfortunately behind a paywall. I am hoping to upload an open access version to a preprint server but this needs to be confirmed with the journal first.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this paper, I argue that the term ""risk factor"" is ambiguous, and that this ambiguity causes pervasive methodological confusion in the epidemiological literature. I argue that many epidemiological papers essentially use an audio recorder to determine whether a tree falling in the forest makes a sound, without being clear about which definition of ""sound"" they are considering.</p>
<p>Even worse, I argue that epidemiologists often try to avoid claiming that their results say anything about causality, by hiding behind ""prediction models"". When they do this. they often still control extensively for ""confounding"", a term which only has a meaning in causal models. I argue that this is analogous to stating that you are interested in whether trees falling in the forest causes any human to perceive the qualia of hearing, and then spending your methods section discussing whether the audio recorder was working properly.</p>
<p>Due to space constraints and other considerations, I am unable to state these analogies explicitly in the paper, but it does include a call for a taboo on the word risk factor, and a reference to Rationality: AI to Zombies. To my knowledge, this is the first reference to the book in the medical literature.</p>
<p>I will give a short talk about this paper at the Less Wrong meetup at the MIRI/CFAR office in Berkeley at 6:30pm tonight.</p>
<p>(I apologize for this short, rushed announcement, I was planning to post a full writeup but I was not expecting this paper to be published for another week)&nbsp;</p>",Anders_H,anders_h,Anders_H,

v567HMJuviThrbLfN,Making nothing out of a big deal,making-nothing-out-of-a-big-deal,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/v567HMJuviThrbLfN/making-nothing-out-of-a-big-deal,2016-12-08T03:41:02.000Z,1,0,0,False,False,,"<p class=""p1"">I recently asked my boyfriend how he heats water, given that he apparently doesn&#8217;t use a kettle. He said you can in fact heat water in a pot on the stove. Heating water in a pot sounds arduous to me, which is a bit strange because it’s not obviously more complicated than heating water in a kettle (assuming there is a clean pot, which is maybe a strong assumption). I wondered if maybe the issue is that once you have a pot on the stove, you are cooking. And <i>cooking</i> is a big deal. I’m not going to make a cup of tea if it involves cooking!</p>
<p class=""p1"">I have actually learned to cook a bit recently, and I think perhaps an important thing going on in ‘learning to cook’ for me is internalizing that you can achieve the same outcome as you might by cooking—which is perhaps too big a deal to carry out just to get some food— by merely doing some physically easy actions that are not a big deal, like picking up objects and putting them on other objects and turning knobs. Sometimes when I turn a knob and fire appears or something it seems like I might be doing something that is a big deal, but overall its going ok.</p>
<p class=""p1"">I remember hearing the advice that if you have an ‘ugh field’, around filling out a certain form at the faculty office say, it can be pretty helpful to do it just once. Then you have ‘an affordance’ and can do it more times easily. An affordance means roughly that it is an action you see as feasible. Taken literally, this might seem strange—surely you thought it was feasible to fill out the form previously. If someone had offered to bet with you about what would happen if you tried to fill out the form, I claim you would have<span class=""Apple-converted-space"">  </span>bet confidently on your success conditional on trying.</p>
<p class=""p1"">I speculate that what ‘an affordance’ often means is seeing something that was a big deal as a set of actions that aren’t. And that in general, when people see actions as abstract &#8216;big deals&#8217; they expect the actions to be harder and take longer than when they see them as constellations of non-big-deal component actions.</p>
<p class=""p1"">So, you get an affordance for starting a company if you feel like it involves writing some things in boxes and sending some emails rather than somehow moving things at the abstract level of ‘companies’. You get an affordance for punching people in the face when punching someone in the face becomes a known physical action to you instead of an abstract sin.

The basic idea in both is that it would be nice to have a panel of trusted moderators carefully pore over every comment and decide on its quality, but since that is too expensive, we can instead use some tools to predict moderator decisions, and have the trusted moderators look at only a small subset of comments in order to calibrate the prediction tools. In Paul's proposal the prediction tool is machine learning (mainly using individual votes as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_%28machine_learning%29"">features</a>), and in Vitalik's proposal it's <a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Prediction_market"">prediction markets</a> where people bet on what the moderators would decide if they were to review each comment.</p>
<p>It seems worth thinking about how to combine the two proposals to get the best of both worlds. One fairly obvious idea is to let people both vote on comments as an expression of their own opinions, and also place bets about moderator decisions, and use ML to set baseline odds, which would reduce how much the forum would have to pay out to incentivize accurate prediction markets. The hoped for outcome is that the ML algorithm would make correct decisions most of the time, but people can bet against it when they see it making mistakes, and moderators would review comments that have the greatest disagreements between ML and people or between different bettors in general. Another part of Vitalik's proposal is that each commenter has to make an initial bet that moderators would decide that their comment is good. The article notes that such a bet can also be viewed as a refundable deposit. Such forced bets / refundable deposits would <a href=""/lw/o7p/crowdsourcing_moderation_without_sacrificing/dit1"">help solve</a> a security problem with Paul's ML-based proposal.</p>
<p>Are there better ways to combine these prediction tools to help with forum moderation? Are there other prediction tools that can be used instead or in addition to these?</p>

I discovered &nbsp;<a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Spaced_repetition"">Anki</a> on this blog. I'm now sharing the tips I've been using for months to learn mathematics with Anki. Example(s) of deck can be found on&nbsp;http://milchior.fr/Anki/</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>I'm a French researcher in fundamental computer science, which essentially means that I do mathematics all day long. But my biggest problem is that I'm really bad at learning mathematics. Let me give an example. Hopefully, you should be able to understand even if you don't know the domains I'm using in my examples. One day, I wanted to discover what category theory is. Another day, I wanted to read an introduction to number theory. Two subjects which seem really interesting. And the first pages of those books seems to be crystal clear. After 10 or 20 pages, I have already forgotten the definitions given in the first page, and I am lost. Definitions are not hard, there is just too many of them.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Let me emphasize that I'm speaking of learning definitions you understand. As far as I know, it is mathematically useless to learn things you do not understand. (Apart, may be, if you try to &nbsp;learn the first digits of Pi, or some few things like that).</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>In the category theory example, definitions are explained by showing how well-known properties of algebra or of topology are special cases of the introduced category definition. Those examples are really helpful to understand the definitions. Indeed, it allows my mind to go from new notions to known notions. For example, I recall that Epi and Mono are generalization of injective and of surjective. Or of surjective and injective. I can't remember which is which. But at least I know that an arrow can both be Epi and Mono. And even know that I know that Epi in Sets are surjective, I still don't know which of the properties of surjection remains. Which is a trouble since having only the Set example would imply that Epi and Mono imply Iso.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>And, to solve this kind of problem, a spaced memorization software is wonderful. The only trouble I have is that the decks which already exist are not really interesting. Because, usually, card creation did not follow any special logic (some scanned hand written lectures note). And furthermore, the already existing decks concern mathematics I'm not interested in. I don't want to learn multiplication table, nor calculus. In fact, the only decks from the community I use are the one from <a href=""https://intelligence.org/rationality-ai-zombies/"">Rationality, from A.I. to Zombie</a> and the one which teach good learning practice. Hence, I'm now creating decks, from books on topic &nbsp;I want to know.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<h1>The rules I follow</h1>
<h2>Decks.</h2>
<div>I create a deck per book. Hence I will be able to give the decks to the community, telling each time exactly what belongs in the deck. It means I accept to put in the decks things I already know. And to put the same thing in different decks (for example, the definition of Open Sets of course belongs to a topology deck. But it also belong to a complex analysis book where this definition is restricted to the case of metric space.) I don't think I'm really wasting my time, it allows me to learn things I don't perfectly know but that I would not have created otherwise. Furthermore, it will hopefully allows the community to begin by any book.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>I must emphasize that the decks are supposed to help reading the book. Not to be used instead of the book. Because having read the proof at least once is often important. And my decks do not contains proofs (apart when I'm reading research paper and that my goal is to understand complex proofs).</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>I don't create the entire deck at once. For example, I'm reading a set theory book. Right now I've only read the first chapter. Because there are already too many definitions I do not remember correctly and which is confusing (the type, the cofinality, ...). Hence it &nbsp;would be too much of a trouble to read the 2nd chapter yet. (Relating to this, I will need to tell the users of my decks to suspend the chapter n+1 until they know the content of the chapter n.)</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Reciprocally, I create many decks simultaneously. Which is coherent with the way maths are studied in university. That is, even if I'm currently blocked in the complex analysis book, I can still read a graph theory book. And while I learn my analysis course, I can create the graph deck.</div>
<h2>Kind of cards.</h2>
<div>A basic anki card is a question and an answer. Sometime, both sides of the cards are questions and answer. It's useful for vocabulary. Since I'm French, I want to know both the English and the French name of the definitions I learn.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Otherwise, I only use clozed deletions. That is, a basic text, with holes you must recall. (Note that it allows to simulate basic cards. So once you selected cloze deletion, you never need to switch back to usual mode).</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Apart from the usual &laquo;front&raquo; and &laquo;extra&raquo; field, I always have a &laquo;reference&raquo; field. In this field, &nbsp;I write chapter, section, subsection and so on. I also write the theorem, lemma, corollary, definition number. I do not write down the page number because of laziness. I think I should, because some books have long sections without any numbered results. And in those case, it takes minutes to find where an information come from. Having theorem number is required because, in order to recall a result, it is usually helpful to remember its proof. And reciprocally, if you forgot the theorem, it may be usefull to read its proof again.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Last important fact. I told Anki not to erase fields when I completed the creation of a card. It is clear that chapter and section numbers rarely change, so it is useful not to have to write them down again. Concerning the mathematics part, I saw that successive cards are often similar. For example, in a linear algebra book, many results begin by &laquo;Let U,V be two vector space and T a morphism from u to V&raquo;. It is helpful not to have to retype it in each cards.</div>
<h3>Definition</h3>
<div>In a definition card, there is usually three deletions. The first is the name of the defined object. The second is the notation of this object. The third one is the definition. If an object admits many equivalent definitions, all definitions appears on the same card. Each definition being a different cloze deletion. Indeed, if your card is &laquo;A square is ... &raquo; and you answer &laquo;A diamond with a 90&deg; angle&raquo;, you don't want to be wrong because it is written &laquo;A rectangle with two adjacent side of same length&raquo;. Therefore, the card is:</div>
<div>&laquo;{{c1::A square}} is: equivalently</div>
<div>-{{c2::A diamond with a 90&deg; angle}} or</div>
<div>-{{c3::A rectangle with two adjacent side of same length}}&raquo;</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Beware, sometime it is better if the name and the notation belong to the same deletion. For example, if X is a subset of a vector space, it is easy to guess that &laquo;Aff(X)&raquo; is &laquo;the Affine Hull &nbsp;of X&raquo; and that &laquo;the affine hull of X&raquo; is denoted &laquo;Aff(X)&raquo;. What you really want is to recall that &laquo;the set of vectors of the form Sum of x_ir_i, with x_i\in X and r_i in the field, where the sum of the r_i is 1&raquo; &nbsp;is &laquo;the affine hull of X&raquo;.</div>
<h3>Theorem</h3>
<div>A theorem usually admits two deletions. Hypothesis and conclusion. It sometime admits a third deletion if the theorem has a classical name. For example you may want to remember that the theorem stating &laquo;In a right triangle, &nbsp;the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. &raquo; is called &nbsp;&laquo;the Pythagorean theorem&raquo;.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Beware, no hypothesis in a deletion should &nbsp;introduce an object. &nbsp;&laquo;If, ... , then the center of P is not trivial&raquo; is hard to understand, whereus &laquo;Let P be a group. If ..., then the center of P is non trivial&raquo; is more clear.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<h4>Hypothesis</h4>
<div>A first important thing is to always write all hypothesis. Sometime, some hypothesis are given in the beginning of a chapter and are assumed to be true in the whole chapter. But, when the card appears, you don't recall those hypothesis (and you don't want to learn that, in this very book, in this very chapter, only complex vector spaces are considered).</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>It is important to have empty deletion. In automata theory, some theorems deal with monoids, and some other only deal with finite monoid. If I write &laquo;If M is a {{c1::finite}} monoid&raquo; for theorem dealing with finite monoid, and &nbsp;&laquo;If M is a monoid&raquo; for theorem dealing with arbitrary monoids, the deletion show that M is assumed finite. Therefore, in the second case, I must write &laquo;If M is a {{c1::}} monoid&raquo;. It's really simple to do, since Anki don't delete the fields when I create a card. So, when the hypothesis that M is finite is not required anymore, I can keep the deletion in the field to create the new card.</div>
<h4>Multiple implications</h4>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">This leads me to another problem. An hypothesis may have many implications. And a property may be implied by many hypothesis. Therefore, it is better to state:</span></p>
<div>&laquo;If {{c1::P1}} or {{c2::P2}} .. or {{c3::Pi}} then {{c4::Q}}&raquo;, or &laquo;If {{c1::P}} then {{c2::Q1}} and {{c3::Q2}} ... and {{c4::Qi}}&raquo;. Indeed, you don't want to be wrong because, of all hypothesis, you thought of the wrong one for this very card. Here, each term in brackets represents a cloze deletion.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>There would be a problem if P implies Q and R and if O and P &nbsp;both imply Q. But this has not happened yet to me. It seems that it does not often happen in math textbooks.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<h4>Order of the words</h4>
<div>When a theorem is of the form &laquo;{{c1::The &nbsp;centralizer of A in G}} {{c2::divides}} {{c3::the normalizer of A in G}}&raquo;, you must also have a card &laquo;The normalizer of A in G {{c1::is divided by}} the centralizer of &nbsp;A in G&raquo;. Otherwise, you could guess the result by pattern matching. Because you know the hole in the middle is either an equality or a dividability statement. Right now, I did not figure out how to do this efficiently. But I should edit my old cards in order to satisfy this property.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Note that you always want to have a cloze deletion named c1. If you don't have it, you can't preview your card, therefore you can't check whether your LaTeX compile. And if you choose to change c2 to c1 later, you need to review your card again, because Anki thinks that it is a new cloze deletion.</div>
<h3>Example</h3>
<div>The last thing I want in Anki are examples. Generally, they are of the form&nbsp;</div>
<div>&laquo;{{c1::A}}, {{c2::B}}.., {{c3::Z}} are examples of {{c4::P}}&raquo;.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>I used to believe that examples were not mathematics. Because, as a Bourbakist, as a logician, I know that an example does not belong to any theory. What matters is definitions, axioms, theorems, proofs. Since, I understood examples have at least three goals. Officially, it gives intuition, and shows cases where theorems can be applied. Formally, it shows that some set of hypothesis is not contradictory, hence it is useful to consider those hypothesis. In practice, this very examples may be used when one want to test statements which does not appear in the course. That is, examples are sometime answers to exercices, or counter example to idea one may have.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<h1>Learning</h1>
<div>Once the cards are made, I ask to Anki to create all images using LaTex (which should be done immediatly in a perfect program, but is not). And I use synchronization to send all cards to my smartphone. (Free application, without ad, they are wonderful!) to learn in the public transport.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Of course, when I &nbsp;create cards, I made mistake. Either because my LaTeX doesn't compile, and Anki shows an error message in the cards. Or because I forgot a word, wrote a word instead of another one. (For example, I always write &laquo;set&raquo; instead of &laquo;state&raquo;.) If I believe there is a mistake, I suspend the card. Once at home, I synchronize and, on my computer, check whether it is really a mistake or not.&nbsp;</div>
<div>It is why I wrote the chapter and section number of each card. &nbsp;It allows me to check quickly whether the card and the book states the same thing.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Sometime, the mistake is a bad cloze deletion. It is possible that, when a part of the sentence is deleted, it makes no sens anymore. For example, it happens if I did not follow the above mentioned rules. (It was the case for the first deck I created, where I didn't devise any rule yet). Same rule applies if I see a mistake so big that I do not understand anymore the question I asked.&nbsp;</div>

<p><strong>Misconception</strong>: In 1941, Hitler was sitting pretty with most of Europe conquered and no huge difficulties on the horizon. Then, due to his megalomania and bullshit ideology, he decided to invade Russia. This was an unforced error of epic proportions. It proved his undoing, like that of Napoleon before him.</p>
<p><strong>Rebuttal</strong>: In hindsight, we think of the Soviet Union as a superpower and military juggernaut which you'd be stupid to go up against. But this is not how things looked to the Germans in 1941. Consider World War I. In 1917<span class=""st"">&ndash;</span>1918, Germany and Austria had defeated Russia at the same time as they were fighting a horrifyingly bloody war with France and Britain - and another devastating European war with Italy. In 1941, Italy was an ally, France had been subdued and Britain wasn't in much of a position to exert its strength. Seemingly, the Germans had much more favorable conditions than in the previous round. And they won the previous round.</p>
<p>In addition, the Germans were not crazy to think that the Red Army was a bit of a joke. The Russians had had their asses handed to them by <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish%E2%80%93Soviet_War_in_1920"">Poland in 1920</a> and in 1939<span class=""st"">&ndash;</span>1940 it had taken the Russians <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_War"">three months</a> and a ridiculous number of casualties to conquer a small slice of Finland.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Russia did have a lot of manpower and a lot of equipment (indeed, far more than the Germans <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClR9tcpKZec"">had thought</a>) and was a potential threat. The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molotov%E2%80%93Ribbentrop_Pact"">Molotov-Ribbentrop pact</a> was obviously cynical and the Germans were not crazy to think that they would eventually have to fight the Russians. Being the first to attack seemed like a good idea and 1941 seemed like a good time to do it. The potential gains were very considerable. Launching the invasion was a rational military decision.</p>
<p><strong>Why this matters</strong>: The idea that Hitler made his most fatal decision for irrational reasons feeds into the conception that evil and irrationality must go hand in hand. It's the same kind of thinking that makes people think a superintelligence would automatically be benign. But there is no fundamental law of the universe which prevents a bad guy from conquering the world. Hitler lost his war with Russia for perfectly mundane and contingent reasons like, &ldquo;the communists had been surprisingly effective at industrialization.&rdquo;</p>",Apprentice,apprentice,Apprentice,

PtAuvfG9dgkPFLHbk,Measuring the Sanity Waterline,measuring-the-sanity-waterline,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/PtAuvfG9dgkPFLHbk/measuring-the-sanity-waterline,2016-12-06T20:38:57.307Z,9,5,21,False,False,,"<p>I've always appreciated the motto, ""<a href=""/lw/1e/raising_the_sanity_waterline/"">Raising the sanity waterline</a>."" Intentionally raising the ambient level of rationality in our civilization strikes me as a very inspiring and important goal.</p>
<p>It occurred to me some time ago that the ""sanity waterline"" could be more than just a metaphor, that it could be quantified. What gets measured gets managed. If we have metrics to aim at, we can talk concretely about strategies to effectively promulgate rationality by improving those metrics. A ""rationality intervention"" that effectively improves a targeted metric can be said to be effective.</p>
<p>It is relatively easy to concoct or discover second-order metrics. You would expect a variety of metrics to respond to the state of ambient sanity. For example, I would expect that, all things being equal, preventable deaths should decrease when overall sanity increases, because a sane society acts to effectively prevent the kinds of things that lead to preventable deaths. But of course other factors may also cause these contingent measures to fluctuate whichever way, so it's important to remember that these are only indirect measures of sanity.</p>
<p>The UN collects&nbsp;<a href=""http://data.un.org/Browse.aspx?d=KI"">a lot of different types of data</a>. Perusing their database, it becomes obvious that there are a lot of things that are probably worth caring about but which have only a very indirect relationship with what we could call ""sanity"". For example, one imagines that GDP would increase under conditions of high sanity, but that'd be a pretty noisy measure.</p>
<p>Take five minutes to think about how one might measure global sanity, and maybe brainstorm some potential metrics. Part of the prompt, of course, is to consider what we could mean by ""sanity"" in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>~~~ <a href=""https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=5%20minute%20timer"">THINK ABOUT THE PROBLEM FOR FIVE MINUTES</a> ~~~</strong></p>
<p>This is my first pass at brainstorming metrics which may more-or-less directly indicate the level of civilizational sanity:</p>
<ul>
<li>(+) Literacy rate</li>
<li>(+)&nbsp;Enrollment rates in primary/secondary/tertiary education</li>
<li>(-)&nbsp;Deaths due to preventable disease</li>
<li>(-)&nbsp;QALYs lost due to preventable causes</li>
<li>(+)&nbsp;Median level of awareness about world events</li>
<li>(-)&nbsp;Religiosity rate</li>
<li>(-)&nbsp;<em>Fundamentalist </em>religiosity rate</li>
<li>(-)&nbsp;Per-capita spent on medical treatments that have not been proven to work</li>
<li>(-)&nbsp;Per-capita spent on medical treatments that have been <em>proven not to work</em></li>
<li>(-) Adolescent fertility rate</li>
<li>(+)&nbsp;Human development index</li>
</ul>
<p>It's potentially more productive (and probably more practically difficult) to talk concretely about how best to improve one or two of these metrics <em>via</em>&nbsp;specific rationality interventions, than it is to talk about popularizing abstract rationality concepts.</p>
<p><em>Sidebar: The CFAR approach may yield something like ""trickle down rationality"", where the top 0.0000001% of rational people are selected and taught to be even more rational, and maybe eventually good thinking habits will infect everybody in the world from the top down. But I wouldn't bet on that being the most efficient path to raising the global&nbsp;sanity waterline.</em></p>
<p>As to the question of the meaning of ""sanity"", it seems to me that this indicates a certain basic package of rationality.</p>
<p>In Eliezer's original post on the topic, he seems to suggest a platform that boils down to a comprehensive embrace of probability-based reasoning and reductionism, with enough caveats and asterisks applied to that summary that you might as well go back and read his original post to get his full point. The idea was that with a high enough sanity waterline, obvious irrationalities like religion would eventually ""go underwater"" and cease to be viable. I see no problem with any of the ""curricula"" Eliezer lists in his post.</p>
<p>It has become popular within the rationalsphere to push back against reductionism, positivism, Bayesianism, etc. While such critiques of ""extreme rationality"" have an important place in the discourse, I think for the sake of <em>this</em>&nbsp;discussion, we should remember that the median human being really would benefit from more rationality in their thinking, and that human societies would benefit from having more rational citizens. Maybe we can all agree on that, even if we continue to disagree on, e.g., the finer points of positivism.</p>
<p>""Sanity"" shouldn't require dogmatic adherence to a particular description of rationality, but it must include at least a basic inoculation of rationality to be worthy of the name. The type of sanity that I would advocate for promoting is this more ""basic"" kind, where religion ends up underwater, but people are still socially allowed to be contrarian in certain regards. After all, a sane society is aware of the power of conformity, and should actively promote some level of contrarianism within its population to promote a diversity of ideas and therefor avoid letting itself become stuck on local maxima.</p>",moridinamael,moridinamael,moridinamael,

I'm a bit out of the loop in terms of what the LW community is like and whether it can maintain multiple view points (and how known the criticisms are).</p>
<p>The TL;DR is I have problems with treating computation in an overly formal fashion. The more pragmatic philosophy suggested implies (but doesn't prove) that AI will not be as powerful as expected as the physicality of computation is important and instantiating computing in a physical fashion is expensive.</p>
<p>I think all the things I will talk about are interesting, but I don't see the sufficiency of them when considering AI running in the real world in real computers.</p>

<h3>1. Source code based decision theory</h3>
<p>I don't understand why:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>other agents trust that your source code is what you say it is</li>
<li>other agents trust that your implementation of your interpreter matches their understanding of the interpreter. I don't see how they get round <a href=""https://www.ece.cmu.edu/~ganger/712.fall02/papers/p761-thompson.pdf"">trustless trust</a>&nbsp;(inserting code/behaviour via malicious compiler/interpreter) issues when they don't have the ability to do&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.acsa-admin.org/2005/abstracts/47.html"">diverse compilation</a>.</li>
</ul>
<div>I understand the justification that causal decision theory is not optimal and you want something better. But it seems that whatever that better thing is has to be able to adapt to conditions. If people start baking in TDT or UDT into the core of their AIs philosophy for all eternity, they can be tricked by machines that 99% the time run the source code they purport to run as expected, but not when the fate of the galaxy decisions are being made. You need a system that can start to do hardware verification on an ad hoc basis if the problems it comes across in the environment warrant it.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<h3>2. General Functionalism</h3>
<p>The idea that it doesn't matter how you compute something just whether the inputs and outputs are the same.</p>
<ol>
<li>The battery life of my phone says that the way of computation is very important, is it done on the cloud and I have to power up my antennae to transmit the result.</li>
<li><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timing_attack"">Timing attacks</a> say that speed of the computation is important, that faster is not always better.</li>
<li><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row_hammer"">Rowhammer</a>&nbsp;says that how you layout your memory is important. Can I flip a bit of your utility calculation?&nbsp;</li>
<li>Memory usage, overheating, van Eck phreaking etc etc....</li>
</ol>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Functionalism is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_abstraction"">leaky abstraction</a>&nbsp;over all of physics. It is in many cases a handy abstraction but it can and will still bite you day to day.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>I point these things out not because I want to abandon either of these in their entirety, just their usage in the core of our thinking about AI design. I think&nbsp;<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragmatism"">pragmatism</a> make a better core as it makes less assumptions about the nature of reality, with other stuff layered on top. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>I also think that an abandonment of functionalism makes AI less scary. If formal proof is insufficient for AI improvement and experimentation and exposure to the world is required to make sure there aren't side channels or resource exhaustions neglected by the formal model, the potential top speed of improvement slows down dramatically. Functionalism collapses the world and simplifies it, if it incorrect to use in the AI field then the solution space (and navigation of it) expands hugely.&nbsp;</div>

<p><span style=""color: #000000; font-family: Arial; font-size: 14.66px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent;"">As an example, MR wrote this article (they just linked to again today) on Ben Carson in 2015/11. Cowen's argument is that, while perhaps implausible (although it may have tenuous support), the idea that Carson believes that the pyramids were used as grain storage isn't in any possible way less unrealistic than any other religious beliefs. If anything, that singular belief is relatively realistic compared to more widely accepted miracles in Christianity, or similar religions.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000; font-family: Arial; font-size: 14.66px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent;"">So why does he get so much flak for it? Cowen argues that he shouldn't, that it's unfounded and irrational/inconsistent. Is it? He obviously has a fair point. The downside is that despite the belief when analyzed not being particularly ridiculous, we all have a shared estimation/expectation that people who hold this type of belief (let's call them Class B religious beliefs) ARE particularly ridiculous.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000; font-family: Arial; font-size: 14.66px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent;"">This then creates a new equilibrium, where only those people who take their Class B religious beliefs *very* seriously will share them. As a result when Carson says the pyramids have grain, our impulse is ""wacky!"" But when Obama implies he believes Jesus rose from the dead, our impulse is ""Boilerplate -- he probably doesn't give it too much thought -- it's a typical belief, which he might not even believe.""</span></p>
<p>As a result we get this constant mismatch between the type of person to hold a belief, and the truth value of the belief itself. I don't mean to only bring up controversial examples, but it's no surprise that this is where these examples thrive. HBD is another common one. While there is something there, which after a fair amount of reading I suspect is overlooked, the type of person to be really passionate about HBD is (more often than not, with exceptions), not the type of person you want over for dinner.</p>
<p>This can suck for people like us. On one hand we want to evaluate individual pieces of information, models, or arguments, based on how they map to reality. On the other hand, if we advocate or argue for information that is correlated with an unsavory type of person, we are classified as that type of person. In this sense, for someone who values a good social standing and no risk to their career as primary objectives, it would be irrational to publicly blog about controversial topics. It's funny, Scott Alexander was retweeted by Anne Coulter for his SCC blog on Trump. He was thrilled, but imagine if he was an aspiring professor? I think he would probably still be fine, because his unique level of genius would still shine through, but lately professors I know who have non-mainstream political views have stopped publicly sharing for fear of controversy.</p>
<p>This is a topic I think about a lot, and now notice becoming a bigger issue in the US. And I wonder directly how to respond. The contradiction between rationally evaluating an idea and irrationally sharing analysis is growing.</p>

In it the teacher explained to us the notion of schools of philosophical thought. According to him classifying philosophers as adhering either to school A or school B, is typical for Anglo thought.&nbsp;</p><p>It deeply annoys me when Americans talk about Democrat and Republican political thought and suggest that you are either a Democrat or a Republican. The notion that allegiance to one political camp is supposed to dictate your political beliefs feels deeply wrong.&nbsp;</p><p>A lot of Anglo high schools do policy debating. The British do it a bit differently than the American but in both cases it boils down to students having to defend a certain side. Traditionally there's nearly no debating at German high schools.&nbsp;</p><p>When writing political essays in German school there’s a section where it's important to present your own view. Your own view isn't supposed to be one that you simply copy from another person. Good thinking is supposed to provide a sophisticated perspective on the topic that is the synthesis of arguments from different sources instead of following a single source.&nbsp;</p><p>That's part of the German intellectual thought has the ideal of 'Bildung'. In Anna Wierzbicka tells me that 'Bildung' is a particularly German construct and the word isn't easily translatable into other languages. The nearest English word is 'education'. 'Bildung' can also be translated as 'creation'. It's about creating a sophisticated person, that's more developed than the average person on the street who doesn't have 'Bildung'. Having 'Bildung' signals having a high status.</p><p>According to this ideal you learn about different viewpoints and then you develop a sophisticated opinion. Not having a sophisticated opinion is low class. In liberal social circles in the US a person who agrees with what the Democratic party does at every point in time would have a respectable political opinion. In German intellectual life that person would be seen as a credulous low status idiot that failed to develop a sophisticated opinion. A low status person isn't supposed to be able to fake being high status by memorizing the teacher's password.</p><p>If you ask me the political question ""Do you support A or B?"", my response is: ""Well, I neither want A or B. There are these reasons for A, there are those reasons for B. My opinion is that we should do C which solves those problems better and takes more concerns into account."" A isn’t the high status option so that I can signal status by saying that I'm in favour of A.</p><p>How does this relate to non-political opinions? In Anglo thought philosophic positions belong to different schools of thought. Members belonging to one school are supposed to fight for their school being right and being better than the other schools.</p><p>If we take the perspective of hardcore materialism, a statement like: ""One of the functions of the heart is to pump blood"" wouldn't be a statement that can be objectively true because it's teleology. The notion of function isn't made up of atoms.</p><p>From my perspective as a German there's little to be gained in subscribing to the hardcore materialist perspective. It makes a lot of practical sense to say that such as statement can be objectively true. I have gotten the more sophisticated view of the world, that I want to have. Not only statements that are about arrangements of atoms can be objectively true but also statements about the functions of organs. That move is high status in German intellectual discourse but it might be low status in Anglo-discourse because it can be seen as being a traitor to the school of materialism.</p><p>Of course that doesn't mean that no Anglo accepts that the above statement can be objectively true. On the margin German intellectual norms make it easier to accept the statement as being objectively true. After Hegel you might say that thesis and antithesis come together to a synthesis instead of thesis or antithesis winning the argument.</p><p>The German Wikipedia page for <a href=""https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kontinentalphilosophie"">""continental philosophy""</a> tells me that the term is commonly used in English philosophy. According to the German Wikipedia it's mostly used derogatorily. From the German perspective the battle between ""analytic philosophy"" and ""continental philosophy"" is not a focus of the debate. The goal isn't to decide which school is right but to develop sophisticated positions that describe the truth better than answers that you could get by memorizing the <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/iq/guessing_the_teachers_password/"">teacher's password</a>.</p><p>One classic example of an unsophisticated position that's common in analytic philosophy is the idea that all intellectual discourse is supposed to be based on logic. In<a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/moi/is_semiotics_bullshit/""> Is semiotics bullshit?</a> <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/user/PhilGoetz/"">PhilGoetz</a> stumbles about a professor of semiotics who claims: ""People have an extra-computational ability to make correct judgements at better-than-random probability that have no logical basis.""</p><p>That's seen as a strong violation of how reasoning based on logical positivism is supposed to work. It violates the memorized teachers password. But is it true? To answer that we have to ask what 'logical basis' means. David Chapman analysis the notion of logic in<a href=""http://meaningness.com/probability-and-logic""> Probability theory does not extend logic</a>. In it he claims that in academic philosophical discourse the phrase logic means predicate logic.</p><p>Predicate logic can make claims such:</p><p>(a) All men are mortal.</p><p>(b) Socrates is a man.</p><p>Therefore:</p><p>(c) Socrates is mortal.</p><p>According to Chapman the key trick of predicate logic is logical quantification. That means every claim has to be able to be evaluated as true or false without looking at the context.</p><p>We want to know whether a chemical substance is safe for human use. Unfortunately our ethical review board doesn't let us test the substance on humans. Fortunately they allow us to test the substance on rats. Hurray, the rats survive.</p><p>(a) The substance is safe for rats.</p><p>(b) Rats are like humans</p><p>Therefore:</p><p>(c) The substance is safe for humans.</p><p>The problem with `Rats are like humans` is that it isn’t a claim that’s simply true or false.</p><p>The truth value of the claim depends on what conclusions you want to draw from it. Propositional calculus can only evaluate the statement as true or false and can’t judge whether it’s an appropriate analogy because that requires looking at the deeper meaning of the statement `Rats are like humans` to decide whether `Rats are like humans` in the context we care about.</p><p>Do humans sometimes make mistakes when they try to reason by analogy? Yes, they do. At the same time they also come to true conclusions by reasoning through analogy. Saying ""People have an extra-computational ability to make correct judgements at better-than-random probability that have no logical basis."" sounds fancy, but if we reasonably define the term logical basis as being about propositional calculus, it's true.</p><p>Does that mean that you should switch from the analytic school to the school of semiotics? No, that's not what I'm arguing. I argue that just as you shouldn't let tribalism influence yourself in politics and identify as Democrat or Republican you should keep in mind that philosophical debates, just as<a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/gz/policy_debates_should_not_appear_onesided/""> policy debates</a>, are seldom one-sided.</p><p>Daring to slay another sacred cow, maybe we also shouldn't go around thinking of ourselves as Bayesian. If you are on the fence on that question, I encourage you to read David Chapman's splendid article I referenced above: <a href=""http://meaningness.com/probability-and-logic"">Probability theory does not extend logic</a></p>",ChristianKl,christiankl,ChristianKl,
s7pbaPs5KqQNiP6J3,Experience diets,experience-diets,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/s7pbaPs5KqQNiP6J3/experience-diets,2016-12-04T23:03:06.000Z,1,0,0,False,False,,"<p class=""p1"">Imagine you have a part of your mind that just keeps track of which visceral experiences you have how often, and then expects more experiences in that ratio. So if you look at pictures of crocodiles, it feels like crocodiles are a bigger part of what is going on in the world. And then if you watch ten youtube videos of people slapping each other in the face, it feels like it is more normal for people to slap each other in the face.<span class=""Apple-converted-space"">  </span>If you get up late in the day for a while, it tells you that the world is mostly dark. If you see starving people, it populates its simulated world with starving people (rather than just those magazine pictures of starving people it previously knew about).</p>
<p class=""p1"">‘Visceral’ is vague, but let’s say there are some kinds of experience it can understand, and some it can&#8217;t. Anecdotes and pictures and direct experience are intelligible, but it interprets more abstract datasets as ‘sometimes there are abstract datasets’. Like a reinforcement learner which can perceive a large subset of the stimuli that other parts of our minds can respond to, though not all of them.</p>
<p class=""p1"">And suppose that you can even intellectually notice that you are responding badly to seeing a few crocodile pictures, but the kinds of mental parts that can &#8216;intellectually notice&#8217; things don&#8217;t speak any languages that the other part knows, so they can&#8217;t just directly fix the problem with explicit efforts. The best they can do is choose to look at a bunch of the most compelling non-crocodile stuff they can find until the other mental part gets the picture. And the whole time you would<i> feel</i> like you have an accurate account of the world.</p>
<p class=""p1"">My impression is that this is what humans are like to some extent, but I don’t know the extent or exact nature of the interaction between this and other ways that humans are. I also don’t know whether this is all a thing that experts have an excellent understanding of, because this is not currently the kind of blog where the blogger does a bunch of research before they write things.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Anyway, if this picture captured an important part of what was going on in the human mind, I might expect a key issue for humans would be strategizing around what kinds of experiences to consume for worldview warping purposes. For instance, this might come up when you are deciding whether to watch ten videos of people slapping each other on YouTube.</p>
<p class=""p1"">People do strategize about this kind of thing a bit. Though I think mostly about people’s behavior, in really extreme cases, or seeking happiness rather than truth. Here are examples I can think of:</p>
<ul>
<li class=""p1"">Whether people should watch porn is often considered to rest heavily on how it might change the viewers&#8217; perceptions of normal sexuality and relationships</li>
<li class=""p1"">Some people argue that others should not play violent video games, on grounds that it might normalize or encourage violence.</li>
<li class=""p1"">There are a variety of arguments about whether the media or advertising should be different, to change various norms.</li>
<li class=""p1"">People sometimes avoid experiences that will be substantially upsetting or unpleasant at the time, sometimes in part because it will change their perceptions. For instance, they will feel a bit like they are in a post-apocalyptic world, or they will get the sense that people usually end up destitute in gutters.</li>
<li class=""p1"">I have heard of people not looking at Facebook because it gives them the impression that every past classmate of theirs just got engaged to a billionaire they met while they were shooting a (critically acclaimed) movie about how exciting their life is, making the prospectiev Facebook viewer&#8217;s mixed success at life less bearable.</li>
<li class=""p1"">People often seek to &#8216;cheer themselves up&#8217;, which arguably means intentionally making their own perception of the world rosier. For instance, they might be cheered up by reading about how a boy saved his father&#8217;s life, or looking at fifty pictures of maximally fluffy and small animals. The former is often described as &#8216;will restore your faith in humanity&#8217;, which suggests it is intended to change your understanding of the world, and I hypothesize much more tentatively that the latter is also intended to actually change your perception of how much of the world consists of baby rabbits.</li>
<li class=""p1"">People sometimes change things in their environment to change their perception of things in their environment, such as themselves. For instance, they put on their pearls and remove the tower of empty soup cans from their floor, to feel like the kind of sophisticated adult who owns expensive jewelry and doesn&#8217;t live in a garbage dump (or a modern art museum). This seems related, though changing your perceptions of your environment by changing your environment does actually cause your environment to be different, so it seems like a marginal case.</li>
<li class=""p1"">I think I sometimes try to interact with some intellectual sphere a bit in order to feel like it is a happening place, to encourage myself to interact with it more. Though this is not very explicit. For instance, if I want to think about the kinds of things I might blog about, I might look at some other related blogs and remind myself that that corner of intellectual cyberspace is real and exciting.</li>
</ul>
<p class=""p1"">These cases are all either involve very extreme and immediate corrections, desire to meddle with someone else&#8217;s behavior,  or efforts to feel better about the world rather than to view it more accurately. The kinds of things I have in mind would be more like:</p>
<ul>
<li class=""p1"">Thinking twice about being entertained by fiction that depicted the world inaccurately, especially in subtle or harmful ways. For instance, TV shows in realistic settings where most people are untrustworthy, cooperation is doomed to fail, and reasonable people invest a lot in watching their backs. Or where things always work out too tidily. Or where &#8216;romance&#8217; and &#8216;friendship&#8217; are different nebulous bundles of behaviors and commitments and such to the ones you would want to think of them as.</li>
<li class=""p1"">Thinking twice about being entertained by fiction that merely depicts the world as conforming to <a href=""https://meteuphoric.wordpress.com/2010/04/23/systems-and-stories/"">story norms</a>.</li>
<li class=""p1"">Even in non-fiction, avoiding habitual interaction with framings, emphases and narratives that you don&#8217;t want to increase your own belief in the importance of. For instance, if you don&#8217;t want to wonder if the world is full of leopard seals, or think that the world is full of people who are interested in the question of whether the world is full of leopard seals, don&#8217;t watch the crazy &#8216;all of our problems are caused by leopard seals&#8217; channel, even ironically or in the intellectual knowledge that you had to search the whole internet to find such an oddity.</li>
<li class=""p1"">You might preferentially associate with people who discuss the world around them in terms of stories that you prefer believe in. For instance, if you are around people who often draw attention to the world&#8217;s mystery, this might push your model of the world toward being intrinsically incomprehensible. While conversation partners who habitually talk about everything as if it has intelligible parts, that might teach you very different expectations.</li>
<li class=""p1"">If you haven&#8217;t seen any failure in some arena because it seems so unimaginable that you don&#8217;t take risks, you might try failing a bit intentionally or closely observing someone else&#8217;s failures, to acquire a sense that failing is a thing you can actually do, with some specific non-world-ending consequences.</li>
<li class=""p1"">If you experience a weird corner of the world relative to other humans, you might just try to spend some time on a more representative sample of activities or places or company. You might look up how other people spend time, note that about <a href=""http://www.alltrucking.com/faq/truck-drivers-in-the-usa/"">1% of people in Amercia are truck drivers</a>, and try to ride in a representative truck one time.</li>
<li class=""p1"">If you think a lot of the world is unpopulated and you spend your time in populated areas almost exclusively (probably true, due to the observer selection effect), you might go to the empty bits if you want a realistic impression of what the physical world is like.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think I occasionally hear these kinds of considerations raised, and maybe acted on, though it is hard to think of examples, other than people sometimes intentionally spending more time with people who nebulously seem like good influences, which might embody some such things.</p>
<p>In the wake of the recent US election, I have heard people talking about mingling more with people from different bubbles. Which also sounds maybe close, but I think they are mostly suggesting talking to political rivals about their explicit views and trying to understand where they are coming from and to empathize with them. I&#8217;m not talking about anything so intellectual or socially virtuous—I&#8217;m just talking about bumping into people who vote differently often enough that your intuitions register their existence. Which is arguably less of a big deal for characteristics that define political divides, because you are probably aware of your political rivals&#8217; existence by the time you are rivaling them. And if not, the media will probably tell you about them. Whereas if you never see any truck drivers, you could easily forget to consistently imagine that there are three million of them around here somewhere. Even if you read a statistic about it once, and could maybe figure out a decent guess if someone directly asked you &#8216;how many truck drivers are there in America?&#8217; And the existence of three million truck drivers probably comes up sometimes, like when speculating about the implications of self driving cars.</p>
<p class=""p1"">So anyway, I claim that this kind of strategizing about experience consumption mostly comes up in fairly extreme or immediate cases, or cases where the costs are to someone else, or in order to improve the enjoyability of one&#8217;s worldview rather than its accuracy. I&#8217;m not very confident about this. But supposing this is true, it might be because the effects are too small to make it worth thinking about (and other people know that, while I don&#8217;t). It could also be that other people are thinking about these things a lot more than I think they are, and they don’t discuss them much, or I forget the good examples.</p>
<p class=""p1"">An interesting explanation is that such strategizing would indeed be very useful, but we mostly don’t do it because it is only strategic from the perspective of the more intellectual parts of our minds. Those parts would like to correct our crazy instinctive picture of the world in pursuit of their own abstract goals. However the part we have been talking about—the ‘visceral picture of the world based on direct observations and stories’<span class=""Apple-converted-space"">  </span>part— doesn’t have any picture of a gap between an accurate abstract world model and its own model. That&#8217;s too abstract for a start, and representing &#8220;model X is badly inaccurate&#8221; inside model X is at least a bit complicated. And our more intellectual mental parts have trouble finding any experience that would really hammer home the fact of this gap. So we don’t really feel like it is a big deal, though it seems like it might be intellectually. This also matches the way people discuss this kind of thing intellectually, but don&#8217;t seem to do much about it.</p><br />  <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/13352/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/13352/"" /></a> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/13352/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/delicious/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/13352/"" /></a> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gofacebook/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/13352/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/facebook/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/13352/"" /></a> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gotwitter/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/13352/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/twitter/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/13352/"" /></a> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/13352/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/stumble/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/13352/"" /></a> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/13352/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/digg/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/13352/"" /></a> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/13352/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/reddit/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/13352/"" /></a> <img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=meteuphoric.wordpress.com&#038;blog=8643840&#038;post=13352&#038;subd=meteuphoric&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1"" width=""1"" height=""1"" />",KatjaGrace,katjagrace,KatjaGrace,
Z3ATiR7gGigcCQzQ6,N=1 Self Analysis,n-1-self-analysis,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Z3ATiR7gGigcCQzQ6/n-1-self-analysis,2016-12-04T20:36:08.190Z,1,1,1,False,False,,"<p>The N=1 scientific field of self-study doesn't seem to have much established basis. It mostly seems to exist through self-experimentation of drugs by through non-conventional channels (i.e. mostly non-academic).</p>
<p>It seems incredibly useful to me, but very awkward. Our brains are powerful, and arguably the most foundational object of analysis for social sciences. Our own brain is also the only human brain we get unrestricted access to. I think, for most people, the base assumption is their brain is special and not a distinct unit of analysis. For a complex bunch of reasons that are hard to pin down, but probably have to do with the fact that most of us have studied methodology or tech, the LW wrong tends to view our own brains as not particularly special computers.</p>
<p>Combine that with studying the persistent biases human brains have with their interaction with reality, we (or at least I) view my own conscious voice as a guy sitting behind a computer running a really advanced program, but one which has lots of biases he has to adjust for. It's only a metaphor, but I'd bet lots of you have similar metaphors for understanding your own thoughts.</p>
<p>Let me give a contemporary example that sparked this post (but not necessarily the main discussion point, or something I'm going to cite sources to back up): Humans seem to have a strong pull towards tribalistic and in-group tendencies. I match the description of 'white man.' Living in the U.S. for the past couple years I have become acutely aware of this for the first time, after having it pointed out to me (usually as a bad thing). My personal model of the world aligns with guys like Jonathan Haidt -- I view tribal and ethno-divided politics as dangerous for democratic stability.</p>
<p>The only reason I bring this up is I've felt this tribalistic pull 'within my brain' (which is such an awkward and strange thing to say). Once I started feeling this in late 2014 I had a strong prediction that there was going to be a new movement associated (I wasn't sure how big, but I put money on Trump winning in Jan 2015). I knew that I was reading much more than other people, and that if I had this feeling lots of others were going to develop it as well. (My point here is that I'm not tribalistic, don't think it's useful for our gov structure, and actually view it as distracting towards much more fruitful goals, but I can't help but feel it).</p>
<p>It's a frustrating reality though that even though my experimentations within my own brain are some of the highest fidelity ones that exist for understanding human behavior, there doesn't seem to be any methodological way to share it, outside of writing down my reasons/feelings and making predictions. As cool as that is, it's not reproducible and it's still unique to my own brain.</p>
<p>I'm posting this here because I'm interested in how you perceive of your own brains impulses and use that to inform your view on other people in a structured way, or of any cases or examples where you have done that successfully or unsuccessfully.</p>",NatashaRostova,natasharostova,NatashaRostova,

I've attended a CFAR workshop including a lesson on <a href=""/lw/o6p/double_crux_a_strategy_for_resolving_disagreement/"">double crux</a>, and found it wore counterintuitive than I expected. I ran my own 3-day event going through the CFAR courses with friends, including double crux, but I don't think anyone started doing double crux based on my attempt to teach it. I have been collecting notes on my thoughts about double crux so as to not lose any; this is a synthesis of some of those notes.]</p>
<p>This is a continuation of my <a href=""/lw/o6p/double_crux_a_strategy_for_resolving_disagreement/digo"">attempt to puzzle at Double Crux until it feels intuitive</a>. While I think I understand the _algorithm_ of double crux fairly well, and I _have_ found it useful when talking to someone else who is trying to follow the algorithm, I haven't found that I can explain it to others in a way that causes them to do the thing, and I think this reflects a certain lack of understanding on my part. Perhaps others with a similar lack of understanding will find my puzzling useful.</p>
<p>Here's a possible argument for double crux as a way to avoid certain conversational pitfalls. This argument is framed as a sort of ""diff"" on my current conversational practices, which are similar to those <a href=""/lw/o6p/double_crux_a_strategy_for_resolving_disagreement/digh"">mentioned by CCC</a>. So, here is approximately what I do when I find an interesting disagreement:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>We somehow decide who states their case first. (Usually, whoever is most eager.) That person gives an argument for their side, while checking for understanding from the other person and looking for points of disagreement with the argument.</li>
<li>The other person asks questions until they think they understand the whole argument; or, sometimes, skip to step 3 when a high-value point of disagreement is apparent before the full argument is understood.</li>
<li>Recurse into step 1 for the most important-seeming point of disagreement in the argument offered. (Again the person whose turn it is to argue their case will be chosen ""somehow""; it may or may not switch.)</li>
<li>If that process is stalling out (the argument is not understood by the other person after a while of trying, or the process is recursing into deeper and deeper sub-points without seeming to get closer to the heart of the disagreement), switch roles; the person who has explained the least of their view should now give an argument for their side.</li>
</ol>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Steps 1-3 can have a range of possible results [using 'you' as the argument-giver and 'they' as the receiver]:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>In the best case, they accept your argument, perhaps after a little recursion into sub-arguments to clarify.</li>
<li>In a very good case, the process finds a lot of common ground (in the form of parts of the argument which are agreed upon) and a precise point of disagreement, X, such that if either person changed their mind about X they'd change their mind about the whole. They can now dig into X in the same way they dug into the overall disagreement, with confidence that resolving X is a good way to resolve the disagreement.</li>
<li>In a slightly less good case, a precise disagreement X is found, but it turns out that the argument you gave wasn't your entire <em>reason</em>&nbsp;for believing what you believe. IE, you've given an argument which you believe to be sufficient to establish the point, but not necessary. This means resolving the point of disagreement X is only potentially changing <em>their</em> mind. At best you may find that your argument fails, in which case you'd give another argument.</li>
<li>In a partial failure case, all the points of disagreement are right away; IE, you fail to find any common ground for arguments to gain traction. It's still possible to recurse into points of disagreement in this case, and doing so may still be productive, but often this is a sign that you haven't understood the other person well enough or that you've put them on the defensive so that they're biased to disagree.</li>
<li>In a failure case, you keep digging down into reasons why they don't buy one point after another, and never really get anywhere. You don't contact with anything which would change their mind, because you're digging into <em>your</em> reasons rather than theirs. Your search for common ground is failing.</li>
<li>In a failure case, you've made a disingenuous argument which your motivated cognition thinks they'll have a hard time refuting, but which is unlikely to convince them. A likely outcome is a long, pointless discussion or an outright rejection of the argument without any attempt to point at specific points of disagreement with it.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>I think double crux can be seen as an attempt to modify the process of 1-4 in a way which attempts to make the better outcomes more common. You can still give your same argument in double crux, but you're checking earlier to see whether it will convince the other person. Suppose you have an argument for the disagreement D:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>""A.</p>
<p>A implies B.</p>
<p>B implies C.</p>
<p>C implies D.</p>
<p>So, D.""</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In my algorithm, you start by checking for agreement with ""A"". You then check for agreement with ""A implies B"". And so on, until a point of disagreement is reached. In double crux, you are helping the other person find cruxes by suggesting cruxes for them. You can ask ""If you believed C, would you believe D?"" Then, if so, ""If you believed B, would you believe D?"" and so on. Going through the argument backwards like this, you only keep going for so long as you have some assurance that you've connected with their model of D. Going through the argument in the forward direction, as in my method, you may recurse into further and further sub-arguments starting at a point of disagreement like ""B implies C"" and find that you never make contact with something in their model which has very much to do with their disbelief of D. Also, looking for the other person's cruxes encourages honest curiosity about their thinking, which makes the whole process go better.</p>
<p>Furthermore, you're looking for your own cruxes at the same time. So, you're more likely to think about arguments which are critical to your belief, and much less likely to try disingenuous arguments designed to be merely difficult to refute.</p>
<p>A quote from Feynman's <a href=""http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/51/2/CargoCult.htm"">Cargo Cult Science</a>:</p>
<blockquote>

<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Times; text-align: justify;"">I would like to add something that&rsquo;s not essential to the science, but something I kind of believe, which is that you should not fool the layman when you&rsquo;re talking as a scientist.

<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Times; text-align: justify;"">&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This kind of ""bending over backwards to show how maybe you're wrong"" (in service of not fooling yourself) is close to double crux. Listing cruxes puts us in the mindset of thinking about ways we could be wrong.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I notice that in a blog post like this, I have a hard time really explaining how I might be wrong before I've explained my basic position. It seems like there's still a role for baking arguments forwards, rather than backwards. In my (limited) experience, double crux still requires each side to explain themselves (which then involves giving some arguments) before/while seeking cruxes. So perhaps double crux can't be viewed as a ""pure"" technique, and really has to be flexible, mixed with other approaches including the one I gave at the beginning. But I'm not sure what the best way to achieve that mixture is.</p>",ProofOfLogic,proofoflogic,ProofOfLogic,

Are you subscribed to Putanumonit? Clicked on a tweet or a status or a post? Followed a trail from SlateStarCodex or LessWrong? Either way, you probably know what to expect here. And, you deserve what&#8217;s coming to you.</p>
<p>But some people took a more interesting path to this blog. According to WordPress Stats, back in January someone googled &#8216;<em><span style=""color:#333399;"">nextpart and hack&#8217;</span></em> and the 7th page of the results took them to my post on <a href=""https://putanumonit.com/2015/12/07/008-water/"" target=""_blank"">water charities</a>. Others arrived on Putanumonit after googling <span style=""color:#333399;""><em>&#8216;gern&#8217;</em></span>, <span style=""color:#333399;""><em>&#8216;sci-put&#8217;</em></span>, <em><span style=""color:#333399;"">&#8216;utrgv &#8220;wewillfail&#8221;&#8216;</span></em> and <span style=""color:#333399;""><em>&#8216;ya fat njie&#8217;</em></span>. I have no clue what any of these people were looking for , but I doubt they found it on Putanumonit. And if there&#8217;s anything I really hate is leaving a client unsatisfied.</p>
<p>I decided to go through the list of search terms that brought people to the blog, and help them out with their unanswered queries. At the end, I&#8217;ll share my absolute favorite link to Putanumonit, one that by itself would have made the hundreds of hours I spend on this site worthwhile.</p>

<h2>Source of pride</h2>
<p>There&#8217;s a subreddit called <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined"" target=""_blank"">r/getdisciplined</a> with a variety of tips to beat procrastination and such. You&#8217;d think the only relevant tip would be<em> &#8220;get off Reddit and get back to work, you lazy bum&#8221;</em>, but apparently there&#8217;s more to it.

<ul>
<li>We&rsquo;ve been working on getting a simple clear mission and an organization that actually works. &nbsp;We think of our goal as analogous to the transition that the old Singularity Institute underwent under Lukeprog (during which chaos was replaced by a simple, intelligible structure that made it easier to turn effort into forward motion).</li>
<li>As part of that, we&rsquo;ll need to find a way to be intelligible.</li>
<li>This is the first of several blog posts aimed at causing our new form to be visible from outside. &nbsp;(If you're in the Bay Area, you can also come meet us at <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/events/227971164302371/"">tonight's open house</a>.) (We'll be talking more about the causes of this mission-change; the extent to which it is in fact a change, etc. in an upcoming post.)</li>
</ul>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Here's a short explanation of our new mission:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We care a lot about AI Safety efforts in particular, and about otherwise increasing the odds that humanity reaches the stars.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also, we[1] believe such efforts are bottlenecked more by our collective epistemology, than by the number of people who <a href=""/lw/jb/applause_lights/"">verbally endorse or act on</a> ""AI Safety"", or any other ""<a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Guessing_the_teacher's_password"">spreadable viewpoint</a>""&nbsp;<a href=""/lw/l9/artificial_addition/"">disconnected</a>&nbsp;<a href=""/lw/sp/detached_lever_fallacy/"">from</a> its&nbsp;<a href=""/lw/la/truly_part_of_you/"">derivation</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our aim is therefore to find ways of improving both individual thinking skill, and the modes of thinking and social fabric that allow people to think <em><a href=""/lw/o6p/double_crux_a_strategy_for_resolving_disagreement/"">together</a></em>. &nbsp;And to do this among the relatively small sets of people tackling existential risk.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><a id=""more""></a>To elaborate a little:</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
<h2>Existential wins and AI safety</h2>
<div>By an &ldquo;existential win&rdquo;, we mean humanity creates a stable, positive future. &nbsp;We care a heck of a lot about this one.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Our working model here accords roughly with the model in Nick Bostrom&rsquo;s book <a href=""https://smile.amazon.com/Superintelligence-Dangers-Strategies-Nick-Bostrom-ebook/dp/B00LOOCGB2/ref=sr_1_1_twi_kin_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1480715153&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=nick+bostrom+superintelligence"">Superintelligence</a>. &nbsp;In particular, we believe that if general artificial intelligence is at some point invented, it will be an <a href=""http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html"">enormously big deal</a>.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>(Lately, AI Safety is being discussed by everyone from <a href=""http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21650543-powerful-computers-will-reshape-humanitys-future-how-ensure-promise-outweighs"">The Economist</a> to <a href=""http://www.newsweek.com/artificial-intelligence-coming-and-it-will-wipe-us-out-if-were-not-careful-433506"">Newsweek</a> to <a href=""https://www.wired.com/2016/10/president-obama-mit-joi-ito-interview/?mbid=social_fb"">Obama</a> to an <a href=""http://futureoflife.org/ai-open-letter/"">open letter from eight thousand</a>. &nbsp;But we&rsquo;ve been thinking on this, and backchaining partly from it, since before that.)</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
<h2>Who we&rsquo;re focusing on, why</h2>
<div>Our preliminary investigations agree with <a href=""http://www.theonion.com/article/smart-qualified-people-behind-the-scenes-keeping-a-17954"">The Onion&rsquo;s</a>; despite some looking, we have found no ultra-competent group of people behind the scenes who have fully got things covered.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>What we have found are:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>AI and machine learning graduate students, researchers, project-managers, etc. who care; who can think; and who are interested in thinking better;</li>
<li>Students and others affiliated with the &ldquo;<a href=""https://www.effectivealtruism.org/"">Effective Altruism</a>&rdquo; movement, who are looking to direct their careers in ways that can do the most good;</li>
<li>Rationality geeks, who are interested in seriously working to understand how the heck thinking works when it works, and how to make it work even in domains as confusing as AI safety.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>These folks, we suspect, are the ones who can give humanity the most boost in its survival-odds per dollar of CFAR&rsquo;s present efforts (which is a statement partly about us, but so it goes). &nbsp;We&rsquo;ve been focusing on them. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>(For the sake of everyone. &nbsp;Would you rather: (a) have bad rationality skills yourself; or (b) be killed by a scientist or policy-maker who also had bad rationality skills?)</div>
<div><br /></div>
</div>
<div>
<h2>Brier-boosting, not Signal-boosting</h2>
<div>Everyone thinks they&rsquo;re right. &nbsp;We do, too. &nbsp;So we have some temptation to take our own favorite current models of AI Safety strategy and to try to get everyone else to shut up about their models and believe ours instead.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>This understandably popular activity is often called &ldquo;signal boosting&rdquo;, &ldquo;raising awareness&rdquo;, or doing &ldquo;outreach&rdquo;.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>At CFAR, though, we force ourselves not to do &ldquo;signal boosting&rdquo; in this way. &nbsp;Our strategy is to spread general-purpose thinking skills, not our current opinions. &nbsp;It is important that we get the truth-seeking skills themselves to snowball across relevant players, because ultimately, creating a safe AI (or otherwise securing an existential win) is a research problem. &nbsp;Nobody, today, has copyable opinions that will get us there.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>We like to call this &ldquo;Brier boosting&rdquo;, because a &ldquo;<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brier_score"">Brier score</a>&rdquo; is a measure of predictive accuracy.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br /></div>
</div>

<div style=""text-align: right""><br /></div>
<div>
<hr />
</div>
<div>[1] By ""We believe X"", we do not mean to assert that every CFAR staff member individually believes X. &nbsp;(Similarly for ""We care about Y). &nbsp;We mean rather that CFAR as an organization is planning/acting as though X is true. &nbsp;(Much as if CFAR promises you a rationality T-shirt, that isn't an individual promise from each of the individuals at CFAR; it is rather a promise from the organization as such.)</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>If we're going to build an art of rationality, we'll need to figure out how to create an organization where people can individually believe whatever the heck they end up actually believing as they chase the evidence, while also having the organization qua organization be predictable/intelligible.</div>

(I write fact posts about pregnancy and childbirth <a href=""https://parentingwithevidence.wordpress.com/"">here.</a>)</p>
<p>To write a fact post, you start with an empirical question, or a general topic. &nbsp;Something like ""How common are hate crimes?"" or ""Are epidurals really dangerous?"" or ""What causes manufacturing job loss?"" &nbsp;</p>
<p>It's okay if this is a topic you know very little about. This is an exercise in original seeing and showing your reasoning, not finding the official last word on a topic or doing the best analysis in the world.</p>
<p>Then you open up a Google doc and start taking notes.</p>
<p>You look for <em>quantitative&nbsp;data from conventionally reliable sources</em>. &nbsp;CDC data for incidences of diseases and other health risks in the US; WHO data for global health issues; Bureau of Labor Statistics data for US employment; and so on. Published scientific journal articles, especially from reputable journals and large randomized studies.</p>
<p>You explicitly do <em>not </em>look for opinion, even expert opinion. You avoid news, and you're wary of think-tank white papers. You're looking for raw information. You are taking a <em>sola scriptura </em>approach, for better and for worse.</p>
<p>And then you start letting the data show you things.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You see things that are surprising or odd, and you note that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You see facts that seem to be inconsistent with each other, and you look into the data sources and methodology until you clear up the mystery.</p>
<p>You orient <em>towards </em>the random, the unfamiliar, the things that are totally unfamiliar to your experience. One of the major exports of Germany is <em>valves</em>? &nbsp;When was the last time I even thought about valves? <em>Why </em>valves, what do you use valves in? &nbsp;OK, show me a list of all the different kinds of machine parts, by percent of total exports. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And so, you dig in a little bit, to this part of the world that you hadn't looked at before. You cultivate the ability to spin up a lightweight sort of fannish obsessive curiosity when something seems like it might be a big deal.</p>
<p>And you take casual notes and impressions (though keeping track of all the numbers and their sources in your notes).</p>
<p>You do a little bit of arithmetic to compare things to familiar reference points. How does this source of risk compare to the risk of smoking or going horseback riding? How does the effect size of this drug compare to the effect size of psychotherapy?</p>
<p>You don't really want to do <em>statistics</em>. You might take percents, means, standard deviations, maybe a Cohen's <em>d </em>here and there, but nothing fancy. &nbsp;You're just trying to figure out what's going on.</p>
<p>It's often a good idea to rank things by raw scale. What is responsible for the bulk of deaths, the bulk of money moved, etc? What is <em>big</em>? &nbsp;Then pay attention more to things, and ask more questions about things, that are <em>big. </em>(Or disproportionately high-impact.)</p>
<p>You may find that this process gives you contrarian beliefs, but often you won't, you'll just have a strongly fact-based assessment of <em>why </em>you believe the usual thing. &nbsp;</p>
<p>There's a quality of <em>ordinariness </em>about fact-based beliefs. It's not that they're never surprising -- they often are. But if you do fact-checking frequently enough, you begin to have a sense of the world overall that <em>stays in place</em>, even as you discover new facts, instead of swinging wildly around at every new stimulus. &nbsp;For example, after doing lots and lots of reading of the biomedical literature, I have sort of a ""sense of the world"" of biomedical science -- what sorts of things I expect to see, and what sorts of things I don't. My ""sense of the world"" isn't that the <em>world itself </em>is boring -- I actually believe in a world rich in discoveries and low-hanging fruit -- but the sense <em>itself </em>has stabilized, feels like ""yeah, that's how things are"" rather than ""omg what is even going on.""</p>
<p>In areas where I'm less familiar, I feel more like ""omg what is even going on"", which sometimes motivates me to go accumulate facts.</p>
<p>Once you've accumulated a bunch of facts, and they've ""spoken to you"" with some conclusions or answers to your question, you write them up on a blog, so that other people can check your reasoning. &nbsp;If your mind gets changed, or you learn more, you write a follow-up post. You should, on any topic where you continue to learn over time, feel embarrassed by the naivety of your early posts. &nbsp;This is fine. This is how learning works.</p>
<p>The advantage of fact posts is that they give you the ability to form independent opinions based on evidence. It's a sort of practice of the skill of seeing. They likely aren't the optimal way to get the most accurate beliefs -- listening to the best experts would almost certainly be better -- but you, personally, may not know who the best experts are, or may be overwhelmed by the swirl of controversy. Fact posts give you a relatively low-effort way of coming to informed opinions. They make you into the proverbial 'educated layman.'</p>
<p>Being an 'educated layman' makes you much more fertile in generating ideas, for research, business, fiction, or anything else. Having facts floating around in your head means you'll naturally think of problems to solve, questions to ask, opportunities to fix things in the world, applications for your technical skills.</p>
<p>Ideally, a&nbsp;<em>group&nbsp;</em>of people writing fact posts on related topics, could learn from each other, and share how they think. I have the strong intuition that this is valuable. It's a bit more active than a ""journal club"", and quite a bit more casual than ""research"". &nbsp;It's just the activity of learning and showing one's work in public.</p>",sarahconstantin,sarahconstantin,sarahconstantin,

ia7C2qhCwbPpeBDwF,Question about metaethics,question-about-metaethics,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ia7C2qhCwbPpeBDwF/question-about-metaethics,2016-12-02T10:21:43.741Z,7,6,6,False,False,,"<p>In a recent Facebook post, Eliezer said :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can believe that most possible minds within mind design space (not necessarily actual ones, but possible ones) which are smart enough to build a Dyson Sphere, will completely fail to respond to or care about any sort of moral arguments you use, without being any sort of moral relativist. Yes. Really. Believing that a paperclip maximizer won't respond to the arguments you're using doesn't mean that you think that every species has its own values and no values are better than any other.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And so I think part of the metaethics sequence went over my head.</p>
<p>I should re-read it, but I haven't yet. In the meantime I want to give an summary of my current thinking and ask some questions.</p>
<p>My current take on morality is that, unlike facts about the world, morality is a question of <em>preference</em>. The important caveats are :</p>
<ol>
<li>The preference set has to be consistent. Until we develop something akin to CEV, humans are probably stuck with a pre-morality where they behave and think over time in contradictory ways, and at the same time believe they have a perfectly consistent moral system.</li>
<li>One <em>can</em> be mistaken about morality, but only in the sense that, unknown to them, they actually hold values different from what the deliberative part of their mind thinks it holds. An introspection failure or a logical error can cause the mistake. Once we identify ground values (not that it's effectively feasible), ""wrong"" is a type error.</li>
<li>It is OK to fight for one's morality. Just because it's subjective doesn't mean one can't push for it. So ""moral relativism"" in the strong sense isn't a consequence of morality being a preference. But ""moral relativism"" in the weak, technical sense (it's subjective) is.</li>
</ol>
<p>I am curious about the following :</p>
<ul>
<li>How does your current view differ from what I've written above?</li>
<li>How exactly does that differ from the thesis of the metaethics sequence? In the same post, Eliezer also said : <em>""and they thought maybe I was arguing for moral realism...""</em>. I did kind of think that, at times.</li>
<li>I specifically do not understand this : <em>""Believing that a paperclip maximizer won't respond to the arguments you're using doesn't mean that you think that every species has its own values and no values are better than any other.""</em>. Unless ""better"" is used in the sense of ""better according to my morality"", but that would make the sentence barely worth saying.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>About these meetups:</strong></p>

<p>The mission of the SF LessWrong meetup is to provide a fun, low-key social space with some structured interaction, where new and non-new community members can mingle and have interesting conversations. Everyone is welcome.</p>

<p>We explicitly encourage people to split off from the main conversation or diverge from the topic if that would be more fun for them (moving side conversations into a separate part of the space if appropriate). Meetup topics are here as a tool to facilitate fun interaction, and we certainly don’t want them to inhibit it.</p></div>

The person who has them may genuinely intend to do the task, but with the ""when"" being vague, there's nothing that would propel them into action.</p><p>Here are some thoughts the person could have instead:</p><ul><li>When I find myself using the words ""later"" or ""at some point"", I'll decide on a specific time when I'll actually do it.</li><li>If I'm given a task that would take under five minutes, and I'm not in a pressing rush, I'll do it right away.</li><li>When I notice that I'm getting stressed out about something that I've left undone, I'll either do it right away or decide when I'll do it.</li></ul><p>Picking a specific time or situation to serve as the <i>trigger</i>&nbsp;of the action makes it much more likely that it actually gets done.</p><p>Could we apply this more generally? Let's consider these examples:</p><ul><li>I'm going to get more exercise.</li><li>I'll spend less money on shoes.</li><li>I want to be nicer to people.</li></ul><p>All of these goals are vague. How will you actually implement them? As long as you don't know, you're also going to miss potential opportunities to act on them.</p><p>Let's try again:</p><ul><li>When I see stairs, I'll climb them instead of taking the elevator.</li><li>When I buy shoes, I'll write down how much money I've spent on shoes this year.</li><li>When someone does something that I like, I'll thank them for it.</li></ul><p>These are much better. They contain both a concrete action to be taken, <i>and</i>&nbsp;a clear trigger for <strong>when</strong> to take it.</p><p><strong>Turning vague goals into trigger-action plans</strong></p><p>Trigger-action plans (TAPs; known as ""<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation_intention"">implementation intentions</a>"" in the academic literature) are ""when-then"" (""if-then"", for you programmers) rules used for behavior modification [i]. A meta-analysis covering 94 studies and 8461 subjects [ii] found them to improve people's ability for achieving their goals [iii]. The goals in question included ones such as reducing the amount of fat in one's diet, getting exercise, using vitamin supplements, carrying on with a boring task, determination to work on challenging problems, and calling out racist comments. Many studies also allowed the subjects to set their own, personal goals.</p><p>TAPs were found to work both in laboratory and real-life settings. The authors of the meta-analysis estimated the risk of publication bias to be small, as half of the studies included were unpublished ones.</p><p><strong>Designing TAPs</strong></p><p>TAPs work because they help us notice situations where we could carry out our intentions. They also help automate the intentions: when a person is in a situation that matches the trigger, they are much more likely to carry out the action. Finally, they force us to turn vague and ambiguous goals into more specific ones.</p><p>A good TAP fulfills three requirements [iv]:</p><ul><li><strong>The trigger is clear. </strong>The ""when"" part is a specific, visible thing that's easy to notice. ""When I see stairs"" is good, ""before four o'clock"" is bad (when before four exactly?). [v]</li><li><strong>The trigger is consistent. </strong>The action is something that you'll <i>always </i>want to do when the trigger is fulfilled. ""When I leave the kitchen, I'll do five push-ups"" is bad, because you might not have the chance to do five push-ups each time when you leave the kitchen. [vi]</li><li><strong>The TAP furthers your goals.</strong>&nbsp;Make sure the TAP is actually useful!</li></ul><p>However, there is one group of people who may need to be cautious about using TAPs. One paper [vii] found that people who ranked&nbsp;highly on so-called socially prescribed perfectionism did worse on their goals when they used TAPs. These kinds of people are sensitive to other people's opinions about them, and are often highly critical of themselves. Because TAPs create an association between a situation and a desired way of behaving, it may make socially prescribed perfectionists anxious and self-critical. In two studies, TAPs made college students who were socially prescribed perfectionists (and only them) worse at achieving their goals.</p><p>For everyone else however, I recommend adopting this TAP:</p><p><i>When I set myself a goal, I'll turn it into a TAP.</i></p><p><strong>Origin note</strong></p><p>This article was <a href=""https://kehitysto.wordpress.com/2015/07/25/konkretiaa-tavoitteisiin-toteutusaikomukset/"">originally published</a> in Finnish at <a href=""http://kehitysto.fi/"">kehitysto.fi</a>.

All subjects were given the goal of finishing the course as quickly as possible, while also damaging their car as little as possible. Subjects in the ""general"" group were additionally given the TAP, ""If I enter a dangerous situation, then I will immediately adapt my speed"". Subjects in the ""specific"" group were given the TAP, ""If I see a black and white curve road sign, then I will immediately adapt my speed"". Subjects with the specific TAP managed to damage their cars less than the subjects with the general TAP, without being any slower for it.</p><p>[vi] Wieber, Gollwitzer, et al. (2009; unpublished study, discussed in [iv]) tested whether TAPs could be made even more effective by turning them into an ""if-then-because"" form: ""when I see stairs, I'll use them instead of taking the elevator, because I want to become more fit"". The results showed that the ""because"" reasons increased the subjects' motivation to achieve their goals, but nevertheless made TAPs less effective.</p><p>The researchers speculated that the ""because"" might have changed the mindset of the subjects. While an ""if-then"" rule causes people to automatically do something, ""if-then-because"" leads people to reflect upon their motivates and takes them from an implementative mindset to a deliberative one. Follow-up studies testing the effect of implementative vs. deliberative mindsets on TAPs seemed to support this interpretation. This suggests that TAPs are likely to work better if they can be carried out as consistently and as with little thought as possible.</p><p>[vii] Powers, T. A., Koestner, R., &amp; Topciu, R. A.

<p>It&#8217;s been eight years since I came across America in real life. I liked it immediately and have spent most of my time here since. I don&#8217;t know what I would have done otherwise, but my guess is that my life would have been pretty different. At least in terms of friends, projects, living arrangements, leisure activities, romantic experiences, proximity to futuristic meal delivery services, intellectual ideas, transit options and weather. I think probably not in terms of approximate personality, ethical views, general life goals, sexual proclivities and height.</p>
<p>My first trip to America was in part a visit to my first boyfriend, so it is also only a little over eight years since I first tried being in romantic relationships. I also liked that, and have also kept it up most of the time since. Which has also substantially influenced many details of my life. Though probably still not my height or approximate personality.</p>
<p>I was talking to a friend recently about how there seems to be an era in their life which they feel continuous with—back maybe a decade—and an era before that which feels more like it belongs to a different person. A nice and similar person, but someone a bit more like a smaller sibling. I said my experience was about the same, including the sense that there was relatively narrow break between eras, rather than earlier and earlier selves just seeming more and more alien. We speculated a bit about how this works (a week after the end of the previous era, did it feel like I had only been myself for a week? Do other people have a similar experience?)</p>
<p>Now I think there are maybe at least a few distinct eras in my own memory, and perhaps they aren&#8217;t as crisp as I thought. But probably one changing of the eras was roughly the year or so in which I came to date people, met many of the (tiny) LessWrong/SingInst/etc community in real life, came to America on holiday then moved here months later,  began to hang out with whole crowds of people more similar to me than almost anyone I had known before and talk about things I cared about, finished undergrad, and started working on real projects instead of student essays about globalization or whatever. Probably less important, but adding to the suitability of this as the beginning of an era, I also stopped being a vegetarian, and tried sex, and hung out in four other countries, and was sick for like a month, and someone was much more effectively unpleasant to me via talking than I had maybe ever experienced. So maybe the relatively abrupt change is in the territory.</p>
<p>I recently found this blog draft that I apparently composed quite near the start of the era defined by those changes—after the heady first week in the US, at the end of November 2008. I didn&#8217;t get around to publishing it then (or, I hope, editing it much). I post it now for historic value. It isn&#8217;t especially interesting, but it feels strange to me to see something from the very beginning of the American Era.</p>
<blockquote><p>At the moment this is a travel blog. More accurately it&#8217;s a not particularly subtle attempt to increase readership of my non-travel blog amongst the people who think I should write to them while I travel. I don&#8217;t intend to write about travelly stuff for very long though, because I don&#8217;t care that much. It&#8217;s a compromise (on your part).</p>
<p>My first glimpse of the land of hope and freedom and chocolate covered sausages was some delicate mountain shaped darkness in the clouds near where I looked for San Francisco. After over 13 hours of not seeing America (well, 21 years, but the last bit stood out), they were welcome mountainous smears. Minutes later, customs were friendly, though in a strangely nosy fashion (so, how did you get the money for this trip? It must be hard while you&#8217;re at uni..), so I escaped early, and waited for Anna, who I contacted through Michael, who I contacted through Eliezer, who I didn&#8217;t know at all, but had written an email to once. We tried to drive to a place to get food, and succeeded after a slightly embarrassing amount of time, considering that we were is a large city stuffed with food. &#8230;  Anna and the other people I met are <a href=""http://singinst.org/overview/whyworktowardthesingularity"">working on</a><a href=""http://singinst.org/overview/whatisthesingularity"">AI</a> risks. For those who don&#8217;t follow links, this means &#8216;preventing robot induced doom&#8217;. The next couple of days were conversation mostly, so I&#8217;ll skip that, though they were a couple of the better days in recent memory.</p>
<p>I awoke the next day to notice I was supposed to leave for the airport right then, followed closely by the realisation that I was actually supposed to leave an hour before. This cost nothing but time, the rest of which ran away with an evening of finding, catching, un-catching, and re-catching other forms of transport. This resulted in Denver, or specifically the home of a couple of <a href=""http://joomla.servas.org/"">Servas</a> members, who I chose from the book because their interests included &#8216;stopping coal power plants&#8217;, which I thought more interesting than the usual &#8216;movies, books, travelling..&#8217;. They have an impressive veggie garden and greenhouse on a city property with a back garden trailing into a lake, and I had a four poster bed and an invitation to Thanksgiving. And internet! Oh, and the company of really interesting and kind people. So far this travel style seems to be about a hundred times as good as hostels (with a wide variance from mood).</p>
<p>The next evening was Thanksgiving. I met the extended family of one of my hosts. While it was a friendly atmosphere surrounding interesting people I won&#8217;t go into it, because I don&#8217;t want to write about people &#8211; to publicly analyse those you&#8217;ve hardly met seems presumptuous, even if it would only be good. On a side note, I was given a tiny chili which I&#8217;m told I have to put in a huge pot of food for edibility.</p>
<p>I got around to looking at Denver on my way to the airport out of a car and bus window respectively. There was a mound of cloud erupting from the horizon which my host said was a coal power plant. How much more serious using electricity seems with that sitting in my line of vision. I&#8217;d never seen one before in real life.</p>
<p>I missed my plane once more, and spent an afternoon experimenting with the capabilities of my newly received iphone (thank you Mama!)  in the presence of airport wifi. I sat beside a tiny girl on the plane who wanted to play hangman. She couldn&#8217;t read, but was tenacious; my loss if presuming words didn&#8217;t usefully inform my letter guessing. I got my bag at the airport about ten minutes before the bus left for my much preferred location, Bloomington. Fortunately this was about 10 seconds longer than it took to find it, realise the bus ticket machine wouldn&#8217;t accept the some denominations of money, discuss with the bus driver the fact that he didn&#8217;t care that much and would go without me, find that nobody behind counters had any money, ask every person in that part of the airport whether they would swap money, tell the guy at the very end of the room I really didn&#8217;t care if he was short a couple of dollars, thank him, run back with my 25 kilos of luggage and buy a ticket while waving to the driver not to commit me to another two hours of sitting in airports today.</p>
<p>I got to Bloomington early and sat on freezing stone seats in the pool of light outside the white stone union of Indiana University. It seemed pretty cold, but I wasn&#8217;t sure how much I was underestimating the real coldness due to numness. I also wasn&#8217;t sure that I was at the right stop. I wandered back and forward and sang just softly enough to not be heard by whoever else might be sharing this lonely foreign night. Apart from being the first chance to sing for days, this kept at least my vocal chords and bottom warm, which shivering on stone seats didn&#8217;t. Ramana rounded a corner and everything changed in a second. The rest has been happy so far, but I don&#8217;t feel like writing about it.</p></blockquote><br />  <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/1975/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/1975/"" /></a> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/1975/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/delicious/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/1975/"" /></a> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gofacebook/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/1975/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/facebook/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/1975/"" /></a> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gotwitter/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/1975/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/twitter/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/1975/"" /></a> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/1975/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/stumble/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/1975/"" /></a> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/1975/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/digg/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/1975/"" /></a> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/1975/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/reddit/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/1975/"" /></a> <img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=meteuphoric.wordpress.com&#038;blog=8643840&#038;post=1975&#038;subd=meteuphoric&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1"" width=""1"" height=""1"" />",KatjaGrace,katjagrace,KatjaGrace,

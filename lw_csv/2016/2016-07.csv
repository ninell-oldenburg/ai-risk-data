<p>Lately, I find myself more and more interested in how the concept of ""systematized winning"" can be applied to large groups of people who have one thing in common, and that not even time, but a hobby or a general interest in a specific discipline. It doesn't seem (to me) to much trouble people working on their own individual qualities - performers, martial artists, managers (who would self-identify as belonging to these sets), but I am basing this on ""general impressions"" and will be glad to be corrected. It does seem to be a norm for some other sets, like sailors, who keep correcting maps every voyage.</p>
<p>The field in which I have been for some years (botany) does have something similar to what sailors do, which lets us to see how floras change over time, etc. However, different questions arise when novel sub-disciplines branch off the main trunk, and naturally, the people asking these new questions keep reaching back for some kind of pre-existing observations. And often they don't check how much weight can be assigned to these observations, which, I think, is a bad habit that won't lead to ""winning"".</p>
<p>It is not ""industrial rationality"" per se, but a distantly related thing, and I think we might <em>have</em> to recognize it somehow. Or at least, recognize that it requires different assumptions... No set victory, for example... Still, it probably matters to more living people than pure ""industrial rationality"" does, &amp; ignoring it won't make it go away.</p>
<p><a id=""more""></a>1. Information inheritance?</p>
<p>Questions change. For a very simply put example, they might go from ""what grows here?"" to ""how is this plant different from the type specimen?"" to [...] to ""what plants indicate older habitats?"" to ""what grew here before?"" The first one and the last one are very different problems. The first one might have been answered with pure agriculture/""traditional land use"" in mind, and the last one - with timing plants' invasions, estimating tolerance to pollution and the ""shell life"" of seeds in soil. (And often, the data are patchy, collected by somebody who wanted to clarify something narrow and specific.)</p>
<p>It is not a feasible goal to ask future botanists to keep monitoring this-or-that habitat or solve the placing of&nbsp;such-and-such genus (although steps can be taken to make these particular problems attractive to them); and who knows what data&nbsp;they&nbsp;would have liked us to gather? Ecology still absorbs many individual reports of old field trips, which are hard to build into the overall structure beyond ""a dot on the map"", because questions have changed. What <em>other </em>disciplines would ask things we cannot anticipate, and is there anything we <em>can</em> do to pass on more than what we are looking for? Are there things we can confidently assume will turn out to be ruinous or beneficent? I am referring not to ""statistics abuse"" - people tend to at least <em>say</em> they shouldn't do that - but to narrower things which are still explainable-like-we-are-both-five.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hindsight is a great thing, for all its biasedness; so - are there any findings which keep drawing attention, and are there any common features to them?&nbsp;Here're my half-baked thoughts on the matter (I expect them to expand, but this is simply what I have right now).</p>
<p>2. Reviewing and expecting to be reviewed.</p>
<p>1) anything about living organisms from Antiquity to Enlightenment is likely to be referred to now&nbsp;and again, for lack of anything better.</p>
<p>2) recent findings about, say, non-random&nbsp;allocation&nbsp;of carbon isotopes in different body parts of plants are going to matter for a long time, having implications for determination&nbsp;of ages of various geological strata. Still, they and subsequent work will be all the more needed&nbsp;<em>after</em> we know more about carbon's geochemistry. So - isotopic analyses of&nbsp;as many body parts&nbsp;as possible should be given much consideration whenever possible, right? It's kind of&nbsp;sobering, to know that you can only do so much, and they might not even put any weight on&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>3. What will help?</p>
<p>I am generally very glad for any research which clarifies issues with&nbsp;established methodologies, while also telling us something so deliciously weird - how on Earth do plants segregate atoms on this level?! I suspect there are lots of findings with similarly far-reaching consequences...</p>
<p>And some of them have had their time and should be put to rest. Behind each number there's a method and an error, but worst of all, behind each number are the general work interests of the scientist who obtained it. Take Mr. Campbell, who together with two or three colleagues advanced life history of ferns about a century ago. He was a great microscopist, grower and naturalist in general, and we still quote him on, say, the duration of <em>Ophioglossum</em> gametophytes' development. But if you read his work, you will not see any precise measurement of the thing, because it was&nbsp;<em>not</em> the problem he was solving! He was busy setting apart&nbsp;<em>Ophioglossaceae</em> and most of the other&nbsp;ferns, and they are indeed apart enough that even were his estimate wrong by ten years, he would still be broadly in the right.</p>
<p>But it is wrong to keep quoting Campbell for a much different purpose of showing how much faster <em>Ophioglossum</em> gametophytes develop <em>in vitro</em>, because the ""broadly in the right"" situation is going to rapidly contract.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the <em>non</em>-quantifiable nature of the data actually makes it easier to review the records (like when some parson describes a stroll through the woods, naming this fern and that), but often, they are <em>too precise</em>.</p>
<p>4. Concluding remarks.</p>
<p>There might not be a general receipt, but so far as I can tell, biology (botany) would be much better off if people had more respect for purely methodological studies. And if previous generations' research priorities were more thoroughly weighed when their data were incorporated into truly novel fields. We can already identify the less solid findings from the past even without knowing the demands of the future. We can stop quoting classics without disclaimers. We can promote including methodological reviews in college textbooks, even on pain of removing some theory.</p>
<p>It's already imaginable.</p>

<p>Turn up at 3:30pm to socialise, because we start at 4pm sharp.</p>

<p>NOTE: We are meeting Sunday this month, and we're in a different room. We'll make it easy to find.</p>

<p>We watch some Pinker, read some Orwell and discuss, in a bid to undertand how language shapes our thinking.</p>

<p>We'll finish with some strategic self-improvement options (none of which involve walking across breaking boards with your bare hands or being asked to chant).</p>

<p>At about 6:30pm some of us will probably head for dinner in the CBD, and you are welcome to join us.</p>

<p><strong>WHEN</strong>: Sun 7 August, 3:30pm to 6:30pm</p>

<p><strong>WHERE</strong>: Ross House, 247 Flinders Lane. 
Ground Floor, past the front desk near the back. Rather than the right hand door where we usually go in, it will be easiest to enter via the main door on the left.</p>

<p>If you have any trouble finding the venue or getting in, text or call Chris on 0439 471 632. For convenience and prompt service, please arrive before 4 pm - that also gives us more chance to catch up before things start.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?</strong>: The Less Wrong Melbourne Rationality Dojos are self-improvement sessions for those committed to the art of rationality and personal growth. We welcome new members who are interested in exploring rationality. We're ""aspiring rationalists"" and always open to learn.</p></div>

Of those, about 65% (just under 50 people) signed up for the newsletter. We had 50 packets with GG descriptions printed, and we ran out by the end of the conference.

Especially promising was a meeting with the Executive Director of the Unitarian Universalist Humanist Association (UUHA), who expressed a strong interest in bringing GGs to her constituents. There are hundreds of UU Humanist groups within congregations around the world. We are currently working on testing a GG at a local UU Humanist group, and we will then write up the results for the UUHA blog. We had some other promising meetings as well, but no one was as interested as the UUHA.</span></p>

Distributing packets was especially helped by the fact that I was a speaker at the SSA, and promoted and handed out packets at my presentation.</span></p>

We met with staff from two national secular organizations, the American Ethical Union and the Center for Inquiry, who expressed an interest in promoting GGs to their members. A number of influencers expressed enthusiasm over the concept of effective giving, and wanted to promote it broadly in the secular/skeptic/humanist movement. </span></p>

We ended up with 70% voting for GiveDirectly at UU and 80% at SSA, and 65% signing up for the newsletter at UU and 80% at the SSA. So, these conferences strongly exceeded our baseline expectations. We did not have specific expectations for giving away packets or meetings with notables. Yet looking back, we certainly did not expect the level of interest we got for conference participants holding Giving Games back home - we would have printed more packets for the UU had we thought they might run out. </span></p>

They get to engage in an activity that embodies their values of using reason and evidence. At the same time, they get to improve the world and build a sense of community without spending a penny. </span></p>

The newsletter sign-ups are especially indicative of people&rsquo;s interests. So are the numbers of people who took packets to host GGs back at their groups. We at InIn already heard from several people who are arranging Giving Games after being exposed to the adapted GG packets, including a UU church that is arranging to have a GG for all 500 members of the church. Based on these outcomes, we at InIn and The Life You Can Save decided it would be even worthwhile to invest into traveling to distant conferences given the right conditions - having a table, &nbsp;speaking role, potential influencers, etc. </span></p>

These are an attempt to collect information on all the meetups happening in upcoming weeks. The best way to get your meetup featured is still to use the Add New Meetup feature, but you'll also have the benefit of having your meetup mentioned in a weekly overview. These overview posts are moved to the discussion section when the new post goes up.</p><p>Please note that for your meetup to appear in the weekly meetups feature, you need to post your meetup&nbsp;<i>before </i>the Friday before your meetup!</p><p>If you check Less Wrong irregularly, consider subscribing to one or more city-specific mailing list in order to be notified when an irregular meetup is happening: <a href=""http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Less_Wrong_meetup_groups#Atlanta.2C_GA""><strong>Atlanta</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href=""http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Less_Wrong_meetup_groups#Cambridge.2C_UK""><strong>Cambridge UK</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href=""http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Less_Wrong_meetup_groups#Chicago.2C_IL""><strong>Chicago</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href=""http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Less_Wrong_meetup_groups#Ohio""><strong>Cincinnati</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href=""http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Less_Wrong_meetup_groups#Ohio""><strong>Cleveland</strong></a><strong>,</strong> <a href=""http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Less_Wrong_meetup_groups#Frankfurt.2C_Germany""><strong>Frankfurt</strong></a><strong>,</strong> <a href=""http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Less_Wrong_meetup_groups#Helsinki.2C_Finland""><strong>Helsinki</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href=""http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Less_Wrong_meetup_groups#Bay_Area.2C_CA""><strong>Marin CA</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href=""http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Less_Wrong_meetup_groups#Ottawa""><strong>Ottawa</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href=""http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Less_Wrong_meetup_groups#Pittsburgh.2C_PA""><strong>Pittsburgh</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href=""http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Less_Wrong_meetup_groups#Portland.2C_OR""><strong>Portland</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href=""http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Less_Wrong_meetup_groups#Salt_Lake_City.2C_UT""><strong>Salt Lake City</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href=""http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Less_Wrong_meetup_groups#Southern_California.2C_CA""><strong>Southern California (Los Angeles/Orange County area)</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href=""http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Meetup#Singapore""><strong>Singapore</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href=""http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Less_Wrong_meetup_groups#St_Louis.2C_MO""><strong>St. Louis</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href=""http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Less_Wrong_meetup_groups#Vancouver""><strong>Vancouver</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href=""http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Meetup#Warsaw.2C_Poland""><strong>Warsaw</strong></a><strong>,</strong> <a href=""http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Less_Wrong_meetup_groups#Waterloo""><strong>Waterloo</strong></a>.</p><p>Whether or not there's currently a meetup in your area, you can <a href=""/lw/f9p/sign_up_to_be_notified_about_new_lw_meetups_in/""><strong>sign up</strong></a> to be notified automatically of any future meetups.

By far the best opportunities for making the world better can be supported by philanthropic money. They last for years. They can be invested in a vast number of times. They can be justified using widely available information and widely verifiable judgments.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Here is another way the world could be. By far the best opportunities are one-off actions that must be done by small numbers of people in the right fleeting time and place. The information that would be needed to justify them is half a lifetime’s worth of observations, many of which would be impolite to publish. The judgments needed must be honed by the same.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">These worlds illustrate opposite ends of a spectrum. The spectrum is something like, &#8216;how much doing good in the world is amenable to being a big, slow, public, official, respectable venture, versus a small, agile, private, informal, arespectable one&#8217;.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">In either world you can do either. And maybe in the second world, you can’t actually get into those good spots, so the relevant intervention is something like trying to. (If the best intervention becomes something like slowly improving institutions so that better people end up in those places, then you are back in the first world). </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">An interesting question is what factor of effectiveness you lose by pursuing strategies appropriate to world 1 versus those appropriate to world 2, in the real world. That is, how much better or worse is it to pursue the usual Effective Altruism strategies (GiveWell, AMF, Giving What We Can) relative to looking at the world relatively independently, trying to get into a good position, and making altruistic decisions.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">I don’t have a good idea of where our world is in this spectrum.

<p><strong>Format:</strong></p>

<p>We meet and start hanging out at 6:15, but don’t officially start doing the meetup topic until 6:45-7 to accommodate stragglers. Usually there is a food order that goes out before we start the meetup topic.</p>

<p><strong>About these meetups:</strong></p>

<p>The mission of the SF LessWrong meetup is to provide a fun, low-key social space with some structured interaction, where new and non-new community members can mingle and have interesting conversations. Everyone is welcome.</p>

<p>We explicitly encourage people to split off from the main conversation or diverge from the topic if that would be more fun for them (moving side conversations into a separate part of the space if appropriate). Meetup topics are here as a tool to facilitate fun interaction, and we certainly don’t want them to inhibit it.</p></div>

</style></head><body><p><em>A putative new idea for AI control; index <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=601"">here</a></em>.</p>
<p>There are various methods, such as <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03137"">Cooperative Inverse Reinforcement Learning</a> (CIRL), that aim to have an AI deduce human preferences in some fashion.</p>
<p>The problem is that humans are not rational - citation certainly not needed. But, worse than that, they are not rational in ways that seriously complicate the task of fitting a reward or utility function to them. I presented one problem this entails in a <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=873"">previous post</a>. That talked about the problems that emerged when an AI could influence a human's preference through the ways it presented the issues.</p>
<hr>
<p>But there are other irrationalities which challenge a value learner. Here are some that can't easily be modelled as ""true preferences + noise"".</p>
<p>#. Humans procrastinate even though they'd generally prefer to proceed with their tasks.
#. Most people who fail a suicide attempt never try again.
#. People can be prejudiced while not desiring to be so (and, often, while not realising they are so).
#. Many rationalists wish to be consistent, and fail at this.
#. The young don't want to have the old-age preferences they should expect to have.
#. People generally take on the preferences of the social group they belong to.
#. Addicts may have stated or revealed preferences to continue to be addicts. However, if they'd never gotten addicted in the first place, they may have stated or revealed preferences to never do so.
#. The whole tension between stated and revealed preferences in the first place.
#. People desiring to have certain beliefs, or at least to not lost them (eg religious beliefs).
#. etc.
#. A lot more ""etc""'s.</p>
<h1>The preference inference problem</h1>
<p>The problem with those preferences is not that they can't be resolved (even though philosophers continue to disagree on many of them). It's that it's really hard to resolve them in a principled way, from observation of base level human behaviour.</p>
<p>Look for example at the tension between revealed and stated preferences. CIRL models the human as knowing the true reward function and wanting to maximise it. Given that this is not the case, the AI could legitimately conclude that the revealed preferences are the true ones, OR that the stated preferences are true. There's nothing in the design, as far as I can tell, which would privilege one or the other. It all depends on the AI's model of human rationality -- a model which cannot be accurate because the underlying assumption, that humans properly know the true reward function, is incorrect.</p>
<p>This and many other preference inconsistencies (such as how we allow our preferences to change over time) cannot easily be modelled by an AI -- or rather, we can't expect that the AI will choose to model them in the correct way.</p>
<h1>Including the meta-preferences directly</h1>
<p>One way of addressing the issue is to make the AI explicitly model human meta-preferences, and have a desire to follow them.</p>
<p>A rough model might be to have the human's revealed preferences as a basis. On top of that, humans have two categories of (first-order) meta-preferences:</p>
<p>#. Unendorsed factors
#. Decision desiderata</p>
<p>A factor is something that can cause a human to reach a particular decision. An unendorsed factor is one that the human does not desire to have (eg prejudices, bias because of worry, and so on).</p>
<p>Decision desiderata are properties that the human wants their decision process to follow, but it doesn't. Short-term time-consistency is an example.</p>
<p>Note that the division between these two categories is not sharp -- time-inconsistency can be seen as using the unendorsed factor of time in the decisions.</p>
<p>Note also that by assuming that we start with a reward function, we're setting up a lot of unendorsed factors from the start: following a reward function implies certain assumptions of independence and transitivity that are typically absent in human decision making. To fit this, the AI will need to assume ridiculous alternate theories to make human decisions reward-tracking, and humans will unendorse a lot of these factors (""no, the position off Venus does not affect my cigarette affect!"").</p>
<p>Are there sensible meta-meta-preferences? Yes there are. Consider, for instance, the idea that your decision should be independent of unchosen alternatives. That's to avoid situations like <a href=""http://torus.math.uiuc.edu/jms/quotes/morgenbesser"">this one</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After finishing dinner, Sidney Morgenbesser decides to order dessert. The waitress tells him he has two choices: apple pie and blueberry pie. Sidney orders the apple pie. After a few minutes the waitress returns and says that they also have cherry pie at which point Morgenbesser says ""In that case I'll have the blueberry pie.""</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wanting to avoid those kinds of decisions is a meta-preference that many humans would endorse. But now consider what happens when you're at the end of a dinner, and, to avoid seeming greedy, you chose the second-largest piece of cake. A perfectly reasonable choice, but in conflict with the meta-preference. In this situation, a meta-meta-preference endorsing the base-level preference over the meta-preference is perfectly fine.</p>
<p>Out of respect for Eliezer's argument, we'll assume that there are meta-meta-meta-preferences, but no more. We could go on to arbitrarily many levels, but there may be issues of convergence then.</p>
<h1>An example</h1>
<p>How could we do this in practice? Note that the problem of AI manipulating the formulation of preferences remains, unless our model is perfect. One way to avoid manipulations is to have the AI determine preferences from data it cannot influence -- maybe the human's behaviour in the last year. Then the AI will attempt to determine what the human's reward function <em>was</em>, rather than what it is.</p>

</ul>
<p>In this simple model, the <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""B""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">B</span></span></span></span></span></span> is entirely determined by the human's higher order preferences. Something only counts as a bias if the human endorses it as a bias, at some level.</p>
<p>Now, we might want to weight preferences versus meta-preferences in some way -- a desire to avoid procrastination is good, but not if it reduces imagination too much. But it's not clear how such a weighting would work, so here I'm assuming that higher order preferences take precedence over all lower order preferences. Indeed, there could be a third order preference for imagination that overrules part of the second order preference for avoiding procrastination.</p>
<p>The human is assumed to have a noisy knowledge of their meta-preferences. And this is where it gets tricky; see <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=896"">this post</a> for some of the problems. Human behaviour (especially spoken behaviour) reveals some of our meta-preferences. Maybe the AI could work with what meta-preferences we would have explicitly endorsed during that year, if asked? This brings in the spectre of AI manipulation, because it can influence the endorsed meta-preference by the choice of questions.</p>
<p>As stated in <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=896"">this post</a>, the better the AI's model of human irrationality -- the closer it can get to knowing correctly what a meta-preference is, what endorsement is, what human knowledge it -- the better. By allowing the AI to explicitly consider meta-preferences, we've improved its model; by improving the definition of meta-preferences, we can improve it still further.</p>
<h1>The ultimate aim</h1>
<p>What would be the goal of this? Ultimately, to find an AI capable of doing preference philosophy work better than human -- but still doing human-appropriate work. We'd want an AI who, without knowledge of these considerations, would identify the ""independence of unchosen alternative"" desiderata, come up with the second-largest desert counterexample, and deduce correctly that humans would endorse that behaviour by adding more complexity to the model.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the AI might be able to solve the issue of changing human preferences, by formalising our meta-etc preferences over these changes.</p>
<p>Note that we're not aiming to ""solve"" human preferences in some abstract sense; we're aiming to find a preference system that's adequate for human survival and flourishing. Because of this, and because of the risk we might have lost an important element in the AI's formalism, we'll need the AIs preference extrapolation to be quite conservative, hewing close to the meta-preferences we feel strongest about.</p>

<p>I'll roughly divide ways of establishing human preferences into four categories:</p>
<p>#. Assume true
#. Best fit
#. Proxy measures
#. Modelled irrationality</p>
<hr>
<p>In some cases, these are more differences of emphasis than sharp technical differences.</p>
<p>For instance <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03137"">Cooperative Inverse Reinforcement Learning</a> (CIRL) assumes that humans have access to their true reward function, and act along with the AI to jointly maximise that. This is a ""assume true"" model: it assumes humans have a real reward function and knowledge of that, and now it attempts to deduce what this is.</p>
<p>My <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=874"">extremely abstract model of human preferences</a> is a ""proxy measure"": it uses the imperfect agent's answer to questions as a way to define preferences.</p>
<p>Both of these methods fail in opposite ways. The big advantage of an ""assume true"" approach is that the AI is setting out to discover a reward function, not to define or manipulate one, hence it (initially) has no incentive to manipulate the human. The big problem is that humans don't actually have access to their true reward function (unless the AI overdoses on ""revealed preferences"" and assumes everything humans do as being a rational expression of a complicated reward function). This can cause a lot of <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=873"">problems</a> depending on how the AI interprets what human irrationality is; indeed, for some interpretations, the AI's incentive to manipulate is still present.</p>
<p>The big advantage with proxy measures is that they refer to a real thing in the real world: the human's answers to AI questions are genuine pieces of data that don't assume anything impossible. The big problem is that since its a proxy and not a genuine measure, the AI is directly incentivised to manipulate the outcome, and will find it much easier to do.</p>
<h1>Best fit and Modelled irrationality</h1>
<p>In a sense, all approaches are ""best fit"" approaches. Unless we had a perfect ideal model of human preferences, some process is needed to fill in the gaps. But I categorise approaches as ""best fit"" if the purpose is specifically to fit a reward/value/utility function to humans, without assuming that humans know this function or that it comes from proxies.</p>
<p>An example is my vague idea, mentioned <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=599"">here</a>, of specifying the complexity of human values and requiring that the value function found be of the same level of complexity -- and then choosing the best fit at that level.</p>
<p>Finally, ""modelled irrationality"" is all about figuring out what biases and irrationalities humans suffer from, and flagging them specifically as irrationalities, and providing instructions as to how they should be ignored or corrected for. The more detailed our model of irrationalities, the better the remainder of human behaviour approaches an ideal agent, and the more powerful the other three approaches can become in conjunction.</p>
<p>I think the best way of establishing human preferences might be some automated version of modelled irrationality.</p>
<h1>Modelling knowledge</h1>
<p>Note that a very accurate model of human irrationality would serve the purpose of allowing the AI to successfully model what human knowledge is, thus allowing us to define statements that are misleading. This would be of great use for Oracle designs, for Tool AIs, and just for general AIs.</p>

<p style=""color: #444444; font-family: Georgia, &quot;Bitstream Charter&quot;, serif; line-height: 1.5; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;"">When making the first choice, either stay home and not buy food or leave and buy food you choose the less stress option. To stay home. I see that as a win. You successfully made the right choice to avoid the immediate stress. Then later you decide that going out is more important/useful/(Less stress) than staying home and not having food. Seems like you also win by carrying out the choice to leave and get food have less stress.</p>
<p style=""color: #444444; font-family: Georgia, &quot;Bitstream Charter&quot;, serif; line-height: 1.5; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;"">You appear to be stressing yourself out over two reasonable choices. I would suggest that you have done well to make both the choice of staying home and later the choice to leave for food.</p>

<p>Someone recently linked me to Bryan Caplan&#8217;s post <A HREF=""http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2014/06/a_hardy_week_ho.html"">A Hardy Weed: How Traditionalists Underestimate Western Civ</A>. He argues that &#8220;western civilization&#8221;&#8216;s supposed defenders don&#8217;t give it enough credit. They&#8217;re always worrying about it being threatened by Islam or China or Degeneracy or whatever, but in fact western civilization can not only hold its own against these threats but actively outcompetes them:</p>
<blockquote><p>The fragility thesis is flat wrong.  There is absolutely no reason to think that Western civilization is more fragile than Asian civilization, Islamic civilization, or any other prominent rivals.  At minimum, Western civilization can and does perpetuate itself the standard way: sheer conformity and status quo bias. </p>
<p>But saying that Western civilization is no more fragile than other cultures is a gross understatement.  The truth is that Western civilization is taking over the globe.  In virtually any fair fight, it steadily triumphs.  Why?  Because, as fans of Western civ ought to know, Western civ is better.  Given a choice, young people choose Western consumerism, gender norms, and entertainment.  Anti-Western governments from Beijing to Tehran know this this to be true: Without draconian censorship and social regulation, &#8220;Westoxification&#8221; will win. </p>
<p>A big part of the West&#8217;s strength, I hasten to add, is its openness to awesomeness.  When it encounters competing cultures, it gleefully identifies competitors&#8217; best traits &#8211; then adopts them as its own.  By the time Western culture commands the globe, it will have appropriated the best features of Asian and Islamic culture.  Even its nominal detractors will be Westernized in all but name.  Picture how contemporary Christian fundamentalists&#8217; consumerism and gender roles would have horrified Luther or Calvin.  Western civ is a good winner.  It doesn&#8217;t demand total surrender.  It doesn&#8217;t make fans of competing cultures formally recant their errors.  It just tempts them in a hundred different ways until they tacitly convert.</p>
<p>Traditionalists&#8217; laments for Western civilization deeply puzzle me.  Yes, it&#8217;s easy to dwell on setbacks.  In a world of seven billion people, you can&#8217;t expect Western culture to win everywhere everyday.  But do traditionalists seriously believe that freshman Western civ classes are the wall standing between us and barbarism?  Have they really failed to notice the fact that Western civilization flourishes all over the globe, even when hostile governments fight it tooth and nail?  It is time for the friends of Western civilization to learn a lesson from its enemies: Western civ is a hardy weed.  Given half a chance, it survives, spreads, and conquers.  Peacefully.</p></blockquote>
<p>I worry that Caplan is eliding the important summoner/demon distinction. This is an easy distinction to miss, since demons often kill their summoners and wear their skin. But in this case, he&#8217;s become hopelessly confused without it.</p>
<p>I am pretty sure there was, at one point, such a thing as western civilization. I think it involved things like dancing around maypoles and copying Latin manuscripts. At some point Thor might have been involved. That civilization is dead. It summoned an alien entity from beyond the void which devoured its summoner and is proceeding to eat the rest of the world.</p>
<p>An analogy: naturopaths like to use the term &#8220;western medicine&#8221; to refer to the evidence-based medicine of drugs and surgeries you would get at your local hospital. They contrast this with traditional Chinese medicine and Ayurvedic medicine, which it has somewhat replaced, apparently a symptom of the &#8220;westernization&#8221; of Chinese and Indian societies.</p>
<p>But &#8220;western medicine&#8221; is just medicine that works. It happens to be western because the West had a technological head start, and so discovered most of the medicine that works first. But there&#8217;s nothing <i>culturally</i> western about it; there&#8217;s nothing Christian or Greco-Roman about using penicillin to deal with a bacterial infection. Indeed, &#8220;western medicine&#8221; replaced the traditional medicine of Europe &#8211; Hippocrates&#8217; four humors &#8211; before it started threatening the traditional medicines of China or India. So-called &#8220;western medicine&#8221; is an inhuman perfect construct from beyond the void, summoned by Westerners, which ate traditional Western medicine first and is now proceeding to eat the rest of the world.</p>
<p>&#8220;Western culture&#8221; is no more related to the geographical west than western medicine. People who complain about western culture taking over their country always manage to bring up Coca-Cola. But in what sense is Coca-Cola culturally western? It&#8217;s an Ethiopian bean mixed with a Colombian leaf mixed with carbonated water and lots and lots of sugar. An American was the first person to discover that this combination tasted really good &#8211; our technological/economic head start ensured that. But in a world where America never existed, eventually some Japanese or Arabian chemist would have found that sugar-filled fizzy drinks were really tasty. It was a discovery waiting to be plucked out of the void, like penicillin. America summoned it but did not create it. If western medicine is just medicine that works, soda pop is just refreshment that works.</p>
<p>The same is true of more intellectual &#8220;products&#8221;. Caplan notes that foreigners consume western gender norms, but these certainly aren&#8217;t gender norms that would have been recognizable to Cicero, St. Augustine, Henry VIII, or even Voltaire. They&#8217;re gender norms that sprung up in the aftermath of the Industrial Revolution and its turbulent intermixing of the domestic and public economies. They arose because they <i>worked</i>. The West was the first region to industrialize and realize those were the gender norms that worked for industrial societies, and as China and Arabia industrialize they&#8217;re going to find the same thing.</p>
<p>Caplan writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>A big part of the West&#8217;s strength, I hasten to add, is its openness to awesomeness.  When it encounters competing cultures, it gleefully identifies competitors&#8217; best traits &#8211; then adopts them as its own.  By the time Western culture commands the globe, it will have appropriated the best features of Asian and Islamic culture.</p></blockquote>
<p>Certainly he&#8217;s pointing at a real phenomenon &#8211; sushi has spread almost as rapidly as Coke. But in what sense has sushi been &#8220;westernized&#8221;? Yes, Europe has adopted sushi. But so have China, India, and Africa. Sushi is another refreshment that works, a crack in the narrative that what&#8217;s going on is &#8220;westernization&#8221; in any meaningful sense.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what I think is going on. Maybe every culture is the gradual accumulation of useful environmental adaptations combined with random memetic drift. But this is usually a gradual process with plenty of room for everybody to adjust and local peculiarities to seep in. The Industrial Revolution caused such rapid change that the process become qualitatively different, a frantic search for better adaptations to an environment that was itself changing almost as fast as people could understand it.</p>
<p>The Industrial Revolution also changed the way culture was spatially distributed. When the fastest mode of transportation is the horse, and the postal system is frequently ambushed by Huns, almost all culture is local culture. England develops a culture, France develops a culture, Spain develops a culture. Geographic, language, and political barriers keep these from intermixing too much. Add rapid communication &#8211; even at the level of a good postal service &#8211; and the equation begins to change. In the 17th century, philosophers were remarking (in Latin, the universal language!) about how Descartes from France had more in common with Leibniz from Germany than either of them did with the average Frenchman or German. Nowadays I certainly have more in common with SSC readers in Finland than I do with my next-door neighbor whom I&#8217;ve never met.</p>
<p>Improved trade and communication networks created a rapid flow of ideas from one big commercial center to another. Things that worked &#8211; western medicine, Coca-Cola, egalitarian gender norms, sushi &#8211; spread along the trade networks and started outcompeting things that didn&#8217;t. It happened in the west first, but not in any kind of a black-and-white way. Places were inducted into the universal culture in proportion to their participation in global trade; Shanghai was infected before West Kerry; Dubai is further gone than Alabama. The great financial capitals became <A HREF=""http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/03/opinion/sunday/the-myth-of-cosmopolitanism.html"">a single cultural region</A> in the same way that &#8220;England&#8221; or &#8220;France&#8221; had been a cultural region in the olden times, gradually converging on more and more ideas that worked in their new economic situation.</p>
<p>Let me say again that this universal culture, though it started in the West, was western only in the most cosmetic ways. If China or the Caliphate had industrialized first, they would have been the ones who developed it, and it would have been much the same. The new sodas and medicines and gender norms invented in Beijing or Baghdad would have spread throughout the world, and they would have looked very familiar. The best way to industrialize is the best way to industrialize. </p>
<p><b>II.</b></p>
<p>Something Caplan was pointing towards but never really said outright: universal culture is by definition the only culture that can survive without censorship.</p>
<p>He writes in his post:</p>
<blockquote><p> The truth is that Western civilization is taking over the globe.  In virtually any fair fight, it steadily triumphs.  Why?  Because, as fans of Western civ ought to know, Western civ is better.  Given a choice, young people choose Western consumerism, gender norms, and entertainment.  Anti-Western governments from Beijing to Tehran know this this to be true: Without draconian censorship and social regulation, &#8220;Westoxification&#8221; will win.</p></blockquote>
<p>Universal culture is the collection of the most competitive ideas and products. Coca-Cola spreads because it tastes better than whatever people were drinking before. Egalitarian gender norms spread because they&#8217;re more popular and likeable than their predecessors. If there was something that outcompeted Coca-Cola, then that would be the official soda of universal culture and Coca-Cola would be consigned to the scrapheap of history. </p>
<p>The only reason universal culture doesn&#8217;t outcompete everything else instantly and achieve fixation around the globe is barriers to communication. Some of those barriers are natural &#8211; Tibet survived universalization for a long time because nobody could get to it. Sometimes the barrier is time &#8211; universal culture can&#8217;t assimilate every little hill and valley instantly. Other times there are no natural barriers, and then your choice is to either accept assimilation into universal culture, or put up some form of censorship.</p>
<p>Imagine that Tibet wants to protect its traditional drink of yak&#8217;s milk. The Dalai Lama requests that everyone continue to drink yak&#8217;s milk. But Coca-Cola tastes much better than yak&#8217;s milk, and everyone knows this. So it becomes a coordination problem: even if individual Tibetans would prefer that their neighbors all drink yak&#8217;s milk to preserve the culture, <i>they</i> want to drink Coca-Cola. The only way yak&#8217;s milk stays popular is if the Dalai Lama bans Coca-Cola from the country.</p>
<p>But westerners aren&#8217;t banning yak&#8217;s milk to &#8220;protect&#8221; their cultures. They don&#8217;t have to. Universal culture is high-entropy; it&#8217;s already in its ground state and will survive and spread without help. All other cultures are low-entropy; they survive only if someone keeps pushing energy into the system to protect them. It could be the Dalai Lama banning Coca-Cola. It could be the Académie Française removing English words from the language. It could be the secret police killing anyone who speaks out against Comrade Stalin. But if you want anything other than universal culture, you better either be surrounded by some <i>very</i> high mountains, or be willing to get your hands dirty.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s one more sense in which universal culture is high-entropy; I think it might be the only culture that can really survive high levels of immigration.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been wondering for a long time &#8211; how come groups that want to protect their traditional cultures worry about immigration? After all, San Francisco is frequently said to have a thriving gay culture. There&#8217;s a strong Hasidic Jewish culture in New York City. Everyone agrees that the US has something called &#8220;black culture&#8221;, although there&#8217;s debate over exactly what it entails. But only 6% of San Francisco is gay. Only 1% of New Yorkers are Hasidim. Only about 11% of Americans are black. So these groups have all managed to maintain strong cultures while being vastly outnumbered by people who are different from them.</p>
<p>So why is <i>anyone</i> concerned about immigration threatening their culture? Suppose that Tibet was utterly overwhelmed by immigrants, tens of millions of them. No matter how many people you import, Tibetan people couldn&#8217;t possibly get more outnumbered in their own country than gays, Hasidim, and blacks already are. But those groups hold on to their cultures just fine. Wouldn&#8217;t we expect Tibetans (or Americans, or English people) to do the same?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still not totally sure about the answer to this one, but once again I think it makes more sense when we realize that Tibet is competing not against Western culture, but against universal culture.</p>
<p>And here, universal culture is going to win, simply because it&#8217;s designed to deal with diverse multicultural environments. Remember, different strategies can succeed in different equilibria. In a world full of auto-cooperators, defect-bot hits the jackpot. In a world full of tit-for-tat-players, defect-bot crashes and burns. Likewise, in a world where everybody else follows Tibetan culture, Tibetan culture may do very well. In a world where there are lots of different cultures all mixed together, Tibetan culture might not have any idea what to do. </p>
<p>(one more hypothetical, to clarify what I&#8217;m talking about &#8211; imagine a culture where the color of someone&#8217;s clothes tells you a lot of things about them &#8211; for example, anyone wearing red is a prostitute. This may work well as long as everyone follows the culture. If you mix it 50-50 with another culture that doesn&#8217;t have this norm, then things go downhill quickly; you proposition a lady wearing red, only to get pepper sprayed in the eye. Eventually the first culture gives up and stops trying to communicate messages through clothing color.)</p>
<p>I think universal culture has done a really good job adapting to this through a strategy of social atomization; everybody does their own thing in their own home, and the community exists to protect them and perform some lowest common denominator functions that everyone can agree on. This is a <i>really</i> good way to run a multicultural society without causing any conflict, but it requires a very specific set of cultural norms and social technologies to work properly, and only universal culture has developed these enough to pull it off. </p>
<p>Because universal culture is better at dealing with multicultural societies, the more immigrants there are, the more likely everyone will just default to universal culture in public spaces. And eventually the public space will creep further and further until universal culture becomes the norm.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t understand the difference between western culture and universal culture, this looks like the immigrants assimilating &#8211; &#8220;Oh, before these people were Chinese people behaving in their foreign Chinese way, but now they&#8217;re Westerners just like us.&#8221; Once you make the distinction, it looks like <i>both</i> Chinese people <i>and</i> traditional Americans assimilating into universal culture in order to share a common ground &#8211; with this being invisible to people who are already assimilated into universal culture, to whom it just looks &#8220;normal&#8221;.</p>
<p><b>III.</b></p>
<p>I stress these points because the incorrect model of &#8220;foreign cultures being Westernized&#8221; casts Western culture as the aggressor, whereas the model of &#8220;every culture is being universalized&#8221; finds Western culture to be as much a victim as anywhere else. Coca-Cola might have replaced traditional yak&#8217;s milk in Mongolia, but it also replaced traditional apple cider in America. A Hopi Indian saddened that her children no longer know the old ritual dances differs little from a Southern Baptist incensed that her kids no longer go to church. Universal values have triumphed over both.</p>
<p>Our society is generally in favor of small, far-away, or exotic groups trying to maintain their culture. We think it&#8217;s great that the Hopi are trying to get the next generation to participate in the traditional dances. We support the Tibetans&#8217; attempt to maintain their culture in the face of pressure from China. We promote black culture, gay culture, et cetera. We think of it as a tragedy when the dominant culture manages to take over and destroy one of these smaller cultures. For example, when white American educators taught Native American children to identify with white American culture and ignore the old ways, that was inappropriate and in some senses &#8220;genocidal&#8221; if the aim was to destroy Native Americans as a separate people. We get excited by the <A HREF=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/30/t-magazine/bhutan-bicycle-gross-national-happiness.html"">story of Bhutan</A>, the tiny Himalayan kingdom trying to preserve its natural and human environment and prevent its own McDonaldization. We tend to be especially upset when the destruction of cultures happens in the context of colonialism, ie a large and powerful country trying to take over and eliminate the culture of a smaller country. Some examples include the English in Ireland, the English in India, the English in Africa, and basically the English anywhere.</p>
<p>One of the most common justifications for colonialism is that a more advanced and enlightened society is taking over an evil and oppressive society. For example, when China invaded Tibet, they said that this was because Tibet was a feudal hellhole where most of the people were living in abject slavery and where people who protested the rule of the lamas were punished by having their eyes gouged out (true!). They declared the anniversary of their conquest &#8220;Serfs Emancipation Day&#8221; and force the Tibetans to celebrate it every year. They say that anyone who opposes the Chinese, supports the Dalai Lama, or flies the old Tibetan flag is allied with the old feudal lords and wants to celebrate a culture based around serfdom and oppression.</p>
<p>But opponents of colonialism tend to believe that cultures are valuable and need to be protected in and of themselves. This is true even if the culture is very poor, if the culture consists of people who aren&#8217;t very well-educated by Western standards, even if they believe in religions that we think are stupid, even if those cultures have unsavory histories, et cetera. We tend to allow such cultures to resist outside influences, and we even celebrate such resistance. If anybody were to say that, for example, Native Americans are poor and ignorant, have a dumb religion with all sorts of unprovable &#8220;spirits&#8221;, used to be involved in a lot of killing and raiding and slave-taking &#8211; and so we need to burn down their culture and raise their children in our own superior culture &#8211; that person would be incredibly racist and they would not be worth listening to. We celebrate when cultures choose preservation of their traditional lifestyles over mere economic growth, like Bhutan&#8217;s <A HREF=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/01/bhutan-wealth-happiness-counts"">gross national happiness</A> program.</p>
<p>This is true in every case except with the cultures we consider our <A HREF=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/30/i-can-tolerate-anything-except-the-outgroup/"">outgroups</A> &#8211; in the US, white Southern fundamentalist Christian Republicans; in the UK, white rural working-class leave voters. In both cases, their ignorance is treated as worthy of mockery, their religion is treated as stupidity and failure to understand science, their poverty makes them &#8220;trailer trash&#8221;, their rejection of economic-growth-at-all-costs means they are too stupid to understand the stakes, and their desire to protect their obviously inferior culture makes them xenophobic and racist. Although we laugh at the Chinese claim that the only reason a Tibetan could identify with their own culture and want to fly its flag is because they support serfdom and eye-gouging, we solemnly nod along with our own culture&#8217;s claim that the only reason a Southerner could identify with their own culture and want to fly its flag is because they support racism and slavery.</p>
<p>(one question I got on the post linked above was why its description of American tribes seemed to fit other countries so well. I think the answer is because most countries&#8217; politics are centered around the conflict between more-universalized and less-universalized segments of the population.)</p>
<p>We could even look at this as a form of colonialism &#8211; if Brexit supporters and opponents lived on two different islands and had different colored skin, then people in London saying things like &#8220;These people are so butthurt that we&#8217;re destroying their so-called &#8216;culture&#8217;, but they&#8217;re really just a bunch of ignorant rubes, and they don&#8217;t realize they need us elites to keep their country running, so screw them,&#8221; would sound a lot more sinister. The insistence that they tolerate unwanted immigration into their lands would look a lot like how China is trying to destroy Tibet by exporting millions of people to it in the hopes they will eventually outnumber the recalcitrant native Tibetans (if you don&#8217;t believe me, believe the Dalai Lama, who apparently <A HREF=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3619322/Dalai-Lama-says-Germany-Arab-country-warns-Europe-taken-migrants.html"">has the same perspective</A>). The claim that they&#8217;re confused bout their own economic self-interest would give way to discussions of Bhutan style <A HREF=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/01/bhutan-wealth-happiness-counts"">&#8220;gross national happiness&#8221;</A>.</p>
<p>(I get accused of being crypto-conservative around here every so often, but I think I&#8217;m just taking my anti-colonialism position to its logical conclusion. A liberal getting upset about how other liberals are treating conservatives, doesn&#8217;t become conservative himself, any more than an American getting upset about how other Americans treat Iraqis becomes an Iraqi.)</p>
<p>And I worry that confusing &#8220;universal culture&#8221; with &#8220;Western culture&#8221; legitimizes this weird double standard. If universal culture and Western culture are the same thing, then Western culture doesn&#8217;t need protection &#8211; as Caplan points out, it&#8217;s the giant unstoppable wave of progress sweeping over everything else. Or maybe it doesn&#8217;t <i>deserve</i> protection &#8211; after all, it&#8217;s the colonialist ideology that tried to destroy local cultures and set itself up as supreme. If Western culture is already super-strong and has a history of trying to take over everywhere else, then surely advocating &#8220;protecting Western culture&#8221; must be a code phrase for something more sinister. We can sympathize with foreign cultures like the Tibetans who are actually under threat, but sympathizing with any Western culture in any way would just be legitimizing aggression.</p>
<p>But I would argue that it&#8217;s universal culture which is the giant unstoppable wave of progress, and that it was universal culture that was responsible for colonizing other cultures and replacing them with itself. And universal culture&#8217;s continuing attempts to subjugate the last unassimilated remnants of traditional western culture are just part of this trend.</p>
<p><b>IV.</b></p>
<p>I am mostly just on the side of consistency. After that I have no idea what to do.</p>
<p>One argument is that we should consistently support traditional cultures&#8217; attempts to defend themselves against universal culture. Support the Native Americans&#8217; ability to practice their old ways, support traditional Siberians trying to return to their shamanistic roots, support Australian Aborigines&#8217; rights to continue the old rituals, support Tibetans&#8217; rights to practice Vajrayana Buddhism, and support rural British people <A HREF=""http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2016/06/why-brexit-happened-the-lens-of-japan.html"">trying to protect Ye Olde England</A> from the changes associated with increased immigration. For most people, this would mean extending the compassion that they feel to the Aborigines, peasants, and Tibetans to apply to the British as well.</p>
<p>But another argument is that we should consistently support universal culture&#8217;s attempt to impose progress on traditional cultures. Maybe we should tell the Native Americans that if they embraced global capitalism, they could have a tacqueria, sushi restaurant, and kebab place <i>all on the same street</i> in their reservation. Maybe we should tell the Aborigines that modern science says the Dreamtime is a myth they need to stop clinging to dumb disproven ideas. Maybe we should tell the Tibetans that Vajrayana Buddhism is too intolerant of homosexuality. Take our conviction that rural Englanders are just racist and xenophobic and ill-informed, and extend that to everyone else who&#8217;s trying to resist a way of life that&#8217;s objectively better.</p>
<p>I am sort of torn on this.</p>
<p>On the one hand, universal culture <i>is</i> objectively better. Its science is more correct, its economy will grow faster, its soft drinks are more refreshing, its political systems are (necessarily) freer, and it is (in a certain specific sense) what everybody would select if given a free choice. It also seems morally better. The Tibetans <i>did</i> gouge out the eyes of would-be-runaway serfs. I realize the circularity of saying that universal culture is <A HREF=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/10/27/contra-huemer-on-morals/"">objectively morally better</A> based on it seeming so to me, a universal culture member &#8211; but I am prepared to suspend that paradox in favor of not wanting people&#8217;s eyes gouged out for resisting slavery.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I think that &#8220;universal culture is what every society would select if given the opportunity&#8221; is less of a knock-down point than it would seem. Heroin use is something every society would select if given the opportunity. That is, if nobody placed &#8220;censorship&#8221; on the spread of heroin, it would rapidly spread from country to country, becoming a major part of that country&#8217;s society. Instead, we implement an almost authoritarian level of control on it, because we know that even though it would be very widely adopted, it&#8217;s not something that is good for anybody in the long term. An opponent of universal culture could say it has the same property.</p>
<p>Things get even worse when you remember that cultures are multi-agent games and each agent pursuing its own self-interest might be a disaster for the whole. Pollution is a good example of this; if the best car is very polluting, and one car worth of pollution is minimal but many cars&#8217; worth of pollution is toxic, then absent good coordination mechanisms everyone will choose the best car even though everyone would prefer a world where nobody (including them) had the best car. I <A HREF=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/"">may have written about this before</A>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m constantly intrigued (though always a little skeptical) by claims that &#8220;primitive&#8221; cultures live happier and more satisfying lives than our own. I know of several of this type. First, <A HREF=""http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/worlds-happiest-countries-are-all-in-central-america-for-first-time-international-poll-finds-10476119.html"">happiness surveys</A> that tend to find Latin American countries doing as well or better than much richer and more advanced European countries. Second, the evidence from the Amish, whose children are allowed to experience the modern culture around them but who usually prefer to stay in Amish society. Third, <A HREF=""http://www.amstudy.hku.hk/staff/kjohnson/PDF/engl56_kj_axtell_whiteindians.pdf"">Axtell&#8217;s paper</A> on prisoner exchanges between early US colonists and Native Americans; colonists captured by the natives almost always wanted to stay and live with the natives; natives captured by the colonists <i>never</i> wanted to stay and live with the colonists. Many people have <A HREF=""http://www.parapundit.com/archives/003609.html"">remarked</A> on how more culturally homogenous countries seem happier. Bhutan itself might be evidence here, although I&#8217;ve seen wildly different claims on where it falls on happiness surveys. I&#8217;ve also <A HREF=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/03/23/the-price-of-glee-in-china/"">talked before</A> about how China&#8217;s happiness level stayed stable or even dropped during its period of rapid development.</p>
<p>(on the other hand, there&#8217;s also a lot of counterevidence. More democratic countries <A HREF=""https://www3.nd.edu/~adutt/activities/documents/InglehartHappinessandDemocracy1.pdf"">seem to be happier</A>, and democracies will generally be the low-censorship countries that get more assimilated into universal culture. Free market economies <A HREF=""http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2010/04/free-tolerant-and-happy/39127/"">are happier</A>. Some studies say that <A HREF=""http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2014/09/satisfied-citizens.aspx"">more liberal countries are happier</A>. And there&#8217;s a <A HREF=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/03/23/the-price-of-glee-in-china/"">complicated but positive</A> relationship between national happiness and wealth.)</p>
<p>I also think that it might be reasonable to have continuation of your own culture as a terminal goal, even if you know your culture is &#8220;worse&#8221; in some way than what would replace it. There&#8217;s a transhumanist joke &#8211; &#8220;Instead of protecting human values, why not reprogram humans to like hydrogen? After all, there&#8217;s a <i>lot</i> of hydrogen.&#8221; There&#8217;s way more hydrogen than beautiful art, or star-crossed romances, or exciting adventures. A human who likes beautiful art, star-crossed romances, and exciting adventures is in some sense &#8220;worse&#8221; than a human who likes hydrogen, since it would be much harder for her to achieve her goals and she would probably be much less happy. But knowing this does not make me any happier about the idea of being reprogrammed in favor of hydrogen-related goals. My own value system might not be objectively the best, or even very good, but it&#8217;s my value system and I want to keep it and you can&#8217;t take it away from me. I am an individualist and I think of this on an individual level, but I could also see having this self-preservation-against-optimality urge for my community and its values.</p>
<p>(I&#8217;ve sometimes heard this called Lovecraftian parochialism, based on H.P. Lovecraft&#8217;s philosophy that the universe is vast and incomprehensible and anti-human, and you&#8217;ve got to draw the line between Self and Other somewhere, so you might as well draw the line at 1920s Providence, Rhode Island, and call everywhere else from Boston all the way to the unspeakable abyss-city of Y&#8217;ha-nthlei just different degrees of horribleness.)</p>
<p>Overall I am not 100% convinced either way. Maybe some traditional cultures are worse than universal culture and others are better? Mostly the confusion makes me want to err on the side of allowing people to go either direction as they see fit, barring atrocities. Which are of course hard to define.</p>
<p>I like the Jewish idea of the Noahide Laws, where the Jews say &#8220;We are not going to impose our values on anyone else&#8230;except <A HREF=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Laws_of_Noah"">these seven values</A> which we think are incredibly important and breaking them is totally beyond the pale.&#8221; Sometimes I wish universal culture would just establish a couple of clear Noahide Laws &#8211; two of them could be &#8220;no slavery&#8221; and &#8220;no eye-gouging&#8221; &#8211; and then agree to bomb/sanction/drone any culture that breaks them while leaving other cultures alone. On the other hand, I also understand universal culture well enough to know that two minutes after the first set of Noahide Laws were established, somebody would propose amending them to include something about how every culture must protect transgender bathroom rights or else be cleansed from the face of the Earth by fire and sword. I&#8217;m not sure how to prevent this, or if preventing it is even desirable. This seems like the same question as the original question, only one meta-level up and without any clear intuition to help me solve it. I guess this is another reason I continue to be attracted to the idea of <A HREF=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/06/07/archipelago-and-atomic-communitarianism/"">Archipelago</A>.</p>
<p>But I think that none of this makes sense unless we abandon the idea that &#8220;universal culture&#8221; and &#8220;western culture&#8221; are one and the same. I think when Caplan&#8217;s debate opponent talked about &#8220;protecting Western culture&#8221;, he was referring to something genuinely fragile and threatened.</p>
<p>I also think he probably cheated by saying we needed to protect it because it was responsible for so many great advances, like Coca-Cola and egalitarian gender norms. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s fair. I think it&#8217;s a culture much like Tibetan or Indian culture, pretty neat in its own way, <i>possibly</i> extra interesting as the first culture to learn the art of summoning entities from beyond the void. Mostly I&#8217;m just happy that it exists in the same way I&#8217;m happy that pandas and gorillas exist, a basic delight in the diversity of the world. I think it can be defended in those terms without having to resolve the debate on how many of its achievements are truly its own.</p>",Yvain,scottalexander,Scott Alexander,

ufTiNviBzgkJTQApF,Reverse lotteries with friends,reverse-lotteries-with-friends,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ufTiNviBzgkJTQApF/reverse-lotteries-with-friends,2016-07-25T02:00:28.000Z,1,0,0,False,False,,"<p>A <a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/07/12/34/"">reverse lottery</a> pays out a little bit each time you pay but sometimes lead to horrific disaster. For instance, going without a seatbelt. You enjoy a momentary convenience every time you drive, but occasionally you die. Relatedly, wearing your seatbelt can be seen as a lottery: you pay a tiny inconvenience each time for an occasional huge win.</p>
<p>Like all lotteries, whether it is good to play depends on the payoffs, and one might reasonably decide to play some lotteries and reverse lotteries and not others. However, as Scott points out, it can be tempting to play reverse lotteries too much. I think this happens in particular from learning what is good by experience. If you play a reverse lottery once, probably you get a reward, and want to do it again. So you do, and get another reward, and it starts to seem like a pretty good idea. You get a lot of visceral feedback about the good aspect, and none about the bad. At least for a while. This seems like a real problem, and a neat way of thinking about it.</p>
<p>So presumably normal lotteries should be the opposite. You play them a few times, and it is a bit bad each time. So you quickly give up and never see the glorious reward. This doesn&#8217;t seem true of the literal lotteries in which people gamble for fun. At least plenty of people are not put off for a very long time, in spite of never winning. But maybe those are a weird instance of the abstract lottery class—for instance, because the prospect of winning a lot of money is made very salient. You might imagine that the negative lotteries would be very off putting in the analogous case: if every time you don&#8217;t wear your seatbelt, you hear about another person dying from that very choice, you wouldn&#8217;t be so tempted by the no-seatbelt reverse lottery.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still confused about how individuals feel about lotteries, because I&#8217;m failing at thinking of clear examples where I know how people behave and they don&#8217;t have a really salient message about how the thing might go well. Possibly this is just because nobody does things that go badly almost all the time. Which is as good a segue as any into the thing I actually wanted to think about.</p>
<p>How do groups feel about lotteries and reverse lotteries?</p>
<p>Groups often learn whether a thing is good by one person trying it, and telling their friends, who then try it if the message was favorable, and so on. On this model, we might expect groups to do the worst kind of failing to think about the low chance outcomes.</p>
<p>For instance, suppose that a bakery sells reverse lottery cakes. They taste nice, but occasionally they make you sick for a day. Alice tries them, and likes them, and tells her friends. They like them. Soon lots of people are loving the reverse lottery cakes, and saying nice things about them. Eventually Zoe gets a badly upset stomach.</p>
<p>This might go ok for group epistemology—maybe Zoe tells her friends, and they radically lower their opinions of the cakes upon hearing how much Zoe hates them (probably too much, since Zoe is one of their few friends), and not only cease eating them themselves, but also warn their other friends, and maybe eventually everyone becomes accurately aware of the costs (I haven&#8217;t checked under what circumstances if any you end up at a good equilibrium).</p>
<p>There are many ways this might not happen though. For instance, if Zoe is less of an enthusiastic proponent of not eating reverse-lottery cakes than her friends are of eating them. Or if people just count up how many people around them like a thing—e.g. &#8220;of all my friends, only one doesn&#8217;t like reverse-lottery cakes, so probably I will like them&#8221;. Or if people disproportionately trust a large number of agreeing friends more than an outlier. These seem more plausible to me than the opposite alternatives, where Zoe becomes a disproportionately fierce critic of the reverse lottery bakery, or where other people hear that there is someone out there—a friend of a friend of a friend—who really didn&#8217;t like the reverse lottery cakes and update too much on this.</p>
<p>There are some important ways these opposite things happen though. For instance, large negatives are more newsworthy than small positives, so for things where the downsides are worthy of a story, I&#8217;d expect there to be some correction, though I&#8217;m not sure whether it should over or undershoot in general. For instance, people are famously over-concerned about sharks. If they just got their information from swimming and hearing about swimming trips from their friends, I might expect them to be under-concerned. However shark attacks make for fairly compelling reading.</p>
<p>So the kinds of situations that I expect crowds to over-invest in reverse lotteries are those where the costs aren&#8217;t really huge or fascinating. Or where it is hard to trace the effect to the (partial) cause. An example off the top of my head is going to theme parks. Most people I know like going to theme parks, as far as I can tell. Two people I know strongly dislike it, because they were injured at theme parks in the past. Without looking at the statistics, it is tempting (for me at least, intuitively) to say, &#8216;Well, basically everyone thinks it&#8217;s good. Maybe those two people were doing something weird. It&#8217;s probably fine&#8217;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was thinking about this because I was writing about a principle of being a good person that I feel emotionally compelled by. I wondered about the causal history of my liking it. I figured I should know about that, so that I could have a more consequentialist view on whether it was actually good. And I realized that maybe I got excited about it after a handful of times where it seemed very useful for making good decisions or being in a good mental state. But I can see how it might go wrong one time in a thousand, and when it does, how it might perhaps sometimes causes some sort of humanitarian crisis or something. If I go around praising this principle based on my own feelings after buying a handful of reverse lottery tickets, then other people might buy more of them, even if it was never a good idea in expectation, and even if I could have predicted that. So I figured I should rethink my principle (I haven&#8217;t yet), and not go around praising things that I admire <a href=""https://meteuphoric.wordpress.com/2016/07/21/two-kinds-of-responses/"">just because I feel like it</a>.</p>

MGPFJw7vDWbZNkSgA,Street Epistemology - letting people name their thinking errors,street-epistemology-letting-people-name-their-thinking,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/MGPFJw7vDWbZNkSgA/street-epistemology-letting-people-name-their-thinking,2016-07-24T19:43:43.439Z,11,7,2,False,False,,"<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Exmjlc4PfEQ</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anthony Magnabosco does what he calls Street Epistemology, usually applying it to supernatural&nbsp;(usually religious) beliefs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The great thing about his method (and his manner, guy's super personable) is that he avoids the social structure of a debate, of two people arguing, of a zero-sum one game where person wins at the other's loss.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've struggled with trying to figure out how to let people save face in disputes (when they're making big, awful mistakes), even considering including minor errors (that don't affect the main point) in my arguments so that they could point them out and we could both admit we were wrong (in their case, about things which do affect the main point) and move on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But this guy's technique manages to invite people to correct their own errors (people are SOOOO much more rational when they're not defensive) and they DO it. No awkwardness, no discomfort, and people pointing out the flaws in their own arguments, and then THANKING him for the talk afterwards and referring him to their friends to talk. Even though they just admitted that their cherished beliefs might not deserve the certainty they've been giving them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is applied to religion in this video, but this seems to me to be a <em>generally</em>&nbsp;useful method when you confront someone making an error in their thinking. Are you forcing people to swallow their pride a little (over and over) when they talk with you? Get that out, and watch how much more open people can be.</p>",Bound_up,bound_up,Bound_up,

Here are two ideas:</span></p>
<p class=""p1"" style=""padding-left:30px;""><span class=""s1""><strong>A) Be sad.</strong> Perhaps think about bittersweet memories. Stare into space. Get completely sidetracked and cry a bit. Downgrade your assessment of how good your life is overall. Until some happy music comes on, at least.</span></p>
<p class=""p1"" style=""padding-left:30px;""><span class=""s1""><strong>B) Decide if you want to be sad, and adjust the playlist accordingly. </strong>Maybe you determine that your goals would be better served by listening to patriotic music on this occasion. So you change it. <em>Even though</em> the sad music is now making you feel like listening to sad music.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">It seems to me that these correspond to two natural classes of things people are doing when they &#8216;respond&#8217; to stuff.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The first kind of response is a relatively automatic reaction to a stimulus. Feeling sad when you hear sad music. Finding a clever retort if someone is rude to you.</span></p>
<p class=""p1"">The second kind of response is a continued pursuit of your goals, adjusted for any information contained in the stimulus. Turning off sad music if it doesn&#8217;t seem helpful. Walking away from a rude person if talking to them is not creating a lot of value, while perhaps considering whether their criticism is relevant to you.</p>
<p class=""p1"">I&#8217;m going to call these reflexive responses and agentic responses.</p>
<p class=""p1"">More examples of stimuli and reflexive and agentic responses to them:</p>
<ul>
<li class=""p1""><strong>Being cold:</strong> curl up under your meager blanket and shiver vigorously // get out of bed, cross the very cold room, turn on the heater.</li>
<li class=""p1""><strong>Hearing a joke: </strong>Laugh proportional to the humor of the joke, adjusted for offensiveness and attractiveness of the joke teller // laugh if you think it would be good to raise the status of the person telling you the joke, or to make them happy, or to make the situation less awkward, etc.</li>
<li class=""p1""><strong>Seeing misinformation on a blog:</strong> write a comment correcting the error // add &#8216;online misinformation&#8217; to your mental list of problems in the world, and then if you decide that it is the most important one at some point, seriously scheme about what to do there.</li>
<li class=""p1""><strong>Someone starts a conversation with you:</strong> say the natural next thing at every juncture // decide if there is something you want to achieve by talking to the person, and then steer the conversation appropriately (perhaps toward winding up)</li>
<li class=""p1""><strong>Physically suffering:</strong> curl up in a ball, close your eyes and whimper // search for painkillers, make a doctor&#8217;s appointment then leave your house and go to it</li>
<li class=""p1""><strong>Emotionally suffering:</strong> avoid thinking about the topic, cry, go over the source of distress in your head, tell other people that you are suffering // try to figure out why you are suffering, and then stop it, even if that involves some amount of thinking about unpleasant things and having uncomfortable conversations.</li>
<li class=""p1""><strong>Being employed:</strong> do the things you are meant to do at jobs, perhaps hinted at by the instructions // choose the bits of the job that are relevant to your goals and emphasize those to the extent that makes sense within the bounds of not jeopardizing your job or failing at your promises.</li>
<li class=""p1""><strong>Being called on to give a speech:</strong> say the things that are meant to go in speeches // say the things you want the audience to hear</li>
<li class=""p1""><strong>Your partner being rude to you in front of your friends:</strong> disrespect them aggressively right back // infer that your partner may not respect you enough or doesn&#8217;t understand social norms or made an error, and make a mental note to figure out which and address the problem later. Decide whether it is valuable to save face in front of present company, and aggressively disrespect them right back, or be nice, or whatever, as appropriate.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a more real example, at the time of writing most of this, I was in much pain, and was lying in bed thinking something like &#8216;Pain! Why pain? Why me? Ow. Pain! Pain pain pain&#8217;. Then I thought that perhaps all the thinking about pain was worse than the actual pain, and that even though noticing that I&#8217;m in pain every two seconds comes pretty naturally to me when I&#8217;m in pain, there are probably actions that better achieve my goals, if I can do them. So I decided to write a blog post instead, which to my surprised actually worked, at least for a bit. [Added upon coming back to this draft: my ability to focus on things other than being in pain didn&#8217;t last terribly long if I recall, but it was good for a bit.]</p>
<p>I claim that it is helpful to distinguish reflexive and agentic responses.</p>
<p>It seems that a key pattern in how humans interact with the world is that they notice events, and then feel the need to respond to them. Even to a person who is otherwise pretty consequentialist, it somehow seems very natural to say a thing right now for no apparent reason, except that some random person said a different thing in your vicinity, and the words you are saying are a semantically and socially natural response to the words that they said. You put your actual projects on hold, because you have to respond.</p>
<p>Furthermore I think when we respond, we usually do it in the reflexive style. Which is natural: there is arguably a lot of responding to be done, and we can&#8217;t think about all of it. But it is nice to remember sometimes that there is also the option of responding agentically. Responding agentically takes mental and perhaps other effort, but that aside will tend to be better (by definition).</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll say more about these classes of behavior as I see them, partly in the hope that this helps with drawing them so that other people know what I&#8217;m talking about.</p>
<p>You might think of reflexive responses as sort of based on feelings and agentic responses as sort of based on explicit thought. I think that isn&#8217;t right—in particular, there are a lot of reflexive responses that also mostly involve explicit thought. It&#8217;s just that the explicit thought isn&#8217;t about how to achieve your goals. For instance, if a person argues with you, you might have a reflexive response of constructing a counterargument and then sending it to the person. Or if you are watching the news and there is a surprising event, you might have a reflexive response of thinking about its implications, and remarking upon them verbally to your companion.</p>
<p>Some reflexive responses were designed by an agentic response previously. For instance, if you noticed before that you should just never listen to a particular song because it will ruin your day, then if it comes on you might skip past it near automatically.</p>
<p>It is often hard to not do a reflexive response. For instance, if you are angry, it can be hard (and arguably destructive) not to express it, perhaps without careful regard for the social consequences. This seems like a fine reason to react reflexively often. I still think that observing the existence of a decent alternative reaction often makes the reflexive response less naturally appealing.</p>
<p>Agentic responses very often involve not doing anything. Because it&#8217;s not that common that an event in your vicinity substantially alters what is the best thing for you to do next. More common than by chance, because things in your vicinity are much more relevant to you than other things. But still not <em>that</em> common.</p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">I&#8217;m rolling a lot of different kinds of behavior into reflexive responses. Intuitive completion of patterns you are part of, fulfillment of roles, expression of the feelings that the stimulus makes you feel, following immediate incentive gradients, doing what feels right, fulfilling instincts. </span></p>
<p>Reflexive responses are often good because they are cheap and predictable. It is cheaper to finish a pattern or to fulfill the role than to rethink your whole plan in light of new evidence. And if people usually respond to X with Y, this perhaps makes them easier to interact with. Arguably, you can just live a whole life of one reflexive response after another, and then you don&#8217;t have to have goals at all, which potentially represents a real saving (at the cost of everything you might have wanted, if you had wanted anything).</p>
<p>Reflexive responses are associated with getting stuck in local optima. For instance, shivering in bed, which is less cold than getting out of bed, but more cold than turning on the heater and waiting five minutes. My guess is that they are also more associated with pathological large scale social interaction traps, such as the <a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/17/the-toxoplasma-of-rage/"">toxoplasma of rage</a>. (While one might reasonably decide that reacting with outrage to something on the internet is the best way at hand of forwarding one&#8217;s goals, this has got to be a lot rarer than reacting out of anger is).</p>
<p>I get some value out of having these concepts. My friend has argued that they are part of a fundamentally wrong worldview, and I think he&#8217;s partly right (a discussion for another time), but I still think they are a good enough approximation of an important thing, and his better worldview doesn&#8217;t seem to naturally support a similar distinction.</p>

<p>We’ll do 7-minute lightning talks with 3 additional minutes allowed for questions. We’ll also limit the number of programming-related talks to no more than half of all talks, in order to promote variety.</p>

<p>A talk doesn’t have to be formal, planned, or even something that you’d expect someone to Give A Talk About; it can be as simple as telling the group about something you find interesting or cool. In the past, we’ve had people talk about topics like: how complicated the process of organizing fresh food for airplane flights is, their experience volunteering for a local political campaign, a video game they were designing and writing, and many others.</p>

<p>For help getting into the building, please call: three zero one, three five six, five four two four.</p>

<p><strong>Format:</strong></p>

<p>We meet and start hanging out at 6:15, but don’t officially start doing the meetup topic until 6:45-7 to accommodate stragglers. Usually there is a food order that goes out before we start the meetup topic.</p>

<p><strong>About these meetups:</strong></p>

<p>The mission of the SF LessWrong meetup is to provide a fun, low-key social space with some structured interaction, where new and non-new community members can mingle and have interesting conversations. Everyone is welcome.</p>

<p>We explicitly encourage people to split off from the main conversation or diverge from the topic if that would be more fun for them (moving side conversations into a separate part of the space if appropriate). Meetup topics are here as a tool to facilitate fun interaction, and we certainly don’t want them to inhibit it.</p></div>

<p>He points out that it&#8217;s too easy to make this about exotic far-off Chinese. Much the same phenomenon occurs closer to home:</p>
<blockquote><p> If nothing really matters in China, if even overcoming horrible problems doesn&#8217;t make the Chinese better off, then what&#8217;s the use of favoring or opposing any public policy? After all, America also shows no rise in average happiness since the 1950s, despite:</p>
<p>1. A big rise in real wages.<br />
2. Environmental clean-up (including lead&#8211;does Flint matter?)<br />
3. Civil rights for African Americans<br />
4. Feminism, gay rights.<br />
5. Dentists now use Novocain (My childhood cavities were filled without it)<br />
6. 1000 channels in glorious widescreen HDTV<br />
7. Blogs</p>
<p>I could go on and on. And yet, if the surveys are to be believed, we are no happier than before. And I think it&#8217;s very possible that we are in fact no happier than before, that there&#8217;s a sort of law of the conservation of happiness. As I walk down the street, grown-ups don&#8217;t seem any happier than the grown-ups I recall as a kid. Does that mean that all of those wonderful societal achievements since 1950 were absolutely worthless?</p>
<p>But there are exceptions. I recall reading that surveys showed a rise in European happiness in the decades after WWII, and Scott reports that happiness is currently very low in Iraq and Syria. So that suggests that current conditions do matter.</p>
<p>The following hypothesis will sound really ad hoc, but matches the way a lot of people I know talk about their lives. Suppose people&#8217;s happiness is normally calibrated around the sort of lifestyle that they view as &#8220;normal.&#8221; As America got richer after 1950, it all seemed very normal, so people didn&#8217;t report more happiness. Ditto for China during the boom years. Everyone around you was also doing better, so you started thinking about how you were doing relative to your neighbors. But Germans walking through the rubble of Berlin in 1948, or Syrians doing so today in Aleppo, do see their plight as abnormal. They remember a time before the war. So they report less happiness than during normal times.</p></blockquote>
<p>The obvious retort is &#8211; modern Chinese grew up when China was very poor. Why didn&#8217;t they calibrate themselves to poverty, such that sudden wealth seems good? What&#8217;s the difference between a Chinese person going from poverty to wealth, versus a Syrian going from stability to chaos? Might it be a shorter time course? A sudden shock is noticeable, a gradual thirty-year improvement in living standards isn&#8217;t?</p>
<p>Probably not. There seem to be a lot of cases where happiness of large groups <i>does</i> change gradually in response to social trends less dramatic than a world war.</p>
<p>First, consider African-Americans. The New York Times <A HREF=""http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/15/business/15leonhardt.html?_r=0"">calls</A> the increase in black happiness over the past forty years “one of the most dramatic gains in the happiness data that you’ll see”. This is not just about poverty; in 1970, blacks who earned more than 75% of whites <A HREF=""http://freakonomics.com/2010/09/15/the-black-white-happiness-gap-large-but-narrowing/"">were</A> only in the tenth percentile of white happiness. Today, those blacks would be in the fiftieth percentile; they&#8217;re still doing worse than would be expected based on income, but not nearly as <i>much</i> worse. This is a very sensible and predictable thing to find. Black people face a lot less racism and discrimination today than in 1970 [citation needed], so assuming that was really unpleasant we shouldn&#8217;t be surprised that they&#8217;re happier. But notice that this is a time course very similar to the rise of China! It doesn&#8217;t look like black people picked a happiness level to calibrate on and then never bothered to adjust. It looks like they adjusted exactly like we would expect them to, even over the course of a multi-decade change.</p>
<p>Second, consider women. In 1970, US women were generally happier than US men. Today, <A HREF=""http://ftp.iza.org/dp4200.pdf"">the reverse is true</A>. There seems to be a general pattern <A HREF=""http://humcap.uchicago.edu/RePEc/hka/wpaper/Graham_Chattopadhyay_2012_GenderandWellBeing.pdf"">around the world</A> of women being happier than men in traditional societies and less happy than men in modern societies (though see Language Log for a <A HREF=""http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1458"">contrary</A> <A HREF=""http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1753"">perspective</A>). I don&#8217;t think of this as a weird paradox. It seems perfectly reasonable to me that having to work outside the home makes people less happy, getting to spend time with their family makes them more happy, and having to work outside the home but also being expected to take care of your family at the same time makes them least happy of all. In any case, the point is that the numbers are changing. Men and women aren&#8217;t just fixating on some level of happiness and staying there, they&#8217;re altering their happiness level based on real trends, just like African-Americans did (but apparently unlike Chinese).</p>
<p>Third, I was finally able to find <A HREF=""https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Christian_Welzel2/publication/228895932_Development_Freedom_and_Rising_Happiness_A_Global_Perspective_(1981-2007)/links/0fcfd511bc8a8dfa40000000.pdf"">a paper</A> that had really good data on change in happiness in different countries, and it supports the idea that happiness can change significantly on a countrywide level.</p>
<p><center><IMG SRC=""http://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/happinessgraph.png""></center></p>
<p>This is change in happiness in a bunch of countries between about 1990 and 2010 (the years were slightly different in each country). There are other graphs for related concepts like life satisfaction and subjective well-being that look about the same.</p>
<p>The most striking finding is that most countries got happier between those two years &#8211; sometimes a lot happier. In Mexico, the percent of people saying they were very happy increased by 25 percentage points! </p>
<p>Just eyeballing the graph, there&#8217;s not an obvious relationship between happiness and economic growth &#8211; China is still near the bottom like we talked about before, and France &#8211; a country that&#8217;s been First World since forever &#8211; is near the top. Even Japan, which is famous for its decades of stagnation, has done pretty well. But the authors tell us that after doing their statistical analyses, there <i>is</i> a strong relationship with economic growth. Okay, I guess.</p>
<p>They also say there&#8217;s a dramatic relationship with freedom and democracy. Mexico, the top country on the graph, went from a relatively closed to a relatively democratic government during this time. South Africa, number five, went from apartheid to no apartheid. Some of the ex-Communist countries like Poland and Ukraine also look pretty good here. On the other hand, other ex-Communist countries like Lithuania and Estonia are near the bottom.  I wonder if this has to do with cutoff points &#8211; since every country started at a slightly different time, maybe they began sampling Poland during the worst parts of Soviet dictatorship and got Lithuania right in the first euphoria of independence? I don&#8217;t know. It all seems very noisy.</p>
<p>They also mention that the United States&#8217; supposedly level happiness is kind of a misunderstanding. People say things like &#8220;Happiness in the US has been flat from 1950 to today&#8221;, but in fact it declined from 1950 to 1979 and increased from 1980 to today. They attribute this to the 1950s being unusually happy; then the 60s and 70s being unusually conflict-prone, and the Reagan Revolution and Clinton years were back to being optimistic. They don&#8217;t have data that stretches too long after that.</p>
<p>(This is pretty neat for Reagan and Clinton. When I die, I&#8217;ll consider my life a success if people attribute a spike on national happiness graphs to my influence.)</p>
<p>So apparently population happiness levels do change in response to relevant social changes, even on multi-decade timescales. Which brings us back to asking &#8211; what&#8217;s up with China?</p>
<p>The graph above shows India as doing okay &#8211; not great, but okay. But <A HREF=""http://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/happinessgraph2.png"">a similar graph on subjective well-being</A> &#8211; which should be another way of looking at the same thing &#8211; shows India as doing pretty poorly, right down there with China &#8211; even though its GDP per capita quadrupled during the period of study.</p>
<p>I see a lot of <A HREF=""http://www.afd.fr/webdav/shared/PORTAILS/PUBLICATIONS/EUDN/EUDN2010/CLARK-SENIK-presentation.pdf"">conflicting</A> perspectives about whether economic growth increases national happiness. It <i>may</i>, but the effect isn&#8217;t as big as you&#8217;d expect, and is usually overpowered by other factors. Maybe it isn&#8217;t even direct, but has something to do with development increasing democracy, liberalism, rule of law, and stability. China got the development, but its happiness genuinely didn&#8217;t increase because of country-specific factors that have something to do with how it developed (inequality? pollution? authoritarianism?).</p>
<p>This matches the race and gender data. Blacks saw a big happiness boost during a time when their feeling of freedom (but not their income) increased relative to whites. Women saw a small happiness drop during a time when their income (but not their feeling of freedom) increased relative to men. </p>
<p>So it looks like happiness <i>can</i> change. It just didn&#8217;t change in China over the past thirty years. The apparent paradox of improving economic situation and stable/decreasing happiness is genuinely paradoxical. Intangibles are probably just way more important than money, even amounts of money big enough to raise whole countries out of poverty.</p>",Yvain,scottalexander,Scott Alexander,

<p>Abstract:</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>An Oracle is a design for potentially high power artificial intelligences (AIs), where the AI is made safe by restricting it to only answer questions. Unfortunately most designs cause the Oracle to be motivated to manipulate humans with the contents of their answers. The second challenge is to get the AI to provide accurate and useful answers. This paper presents three Oracle designs that get around the manipulation and accuracy problems in different ways: the Counterfactually Unread Agent, the Verified Selective Agent, and the Virtual-world Time-bounded Agent. It demonstrates how each design is safe (given that humans stick with the protocols), and allows different types of questions and answers. Finally, it investigates what happens when the implementation is slightly imperfect, concluding the first two agent designs are robust to this, but not the third.</p>

Of course, this is not the case when <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_(game_theory)#Mixed_strategy"">facing other agents</a>, but I had the impression this would hold when facing <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_versus_environment"">the environment</a> rather that <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_versus_player"">other players</a>.</p>
<p>But stochastic policies can also be needed if the environment is partially observable, at least if the policy is Markov (memoryless). Consider the following <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_observable_Markov_decision_process"">POMDP</a> (partially observable Markov decision process):</p>

<p>There are two states, 1a and 1b, and the agent cannot tell which one they're in. Action A in state 1a and B in state 1b, gives a reward of -R and keeps the agent in the same place. Action B in state 1a and A in state 1b, gives a reward of R and moves the agent to the other state.</p>
<p>The returns for the two deterministic policies - A and B - are -R every turn except maybe for the first. While the return for the stochastic policy of 0.5A + 0.5B is 0 per turn.</p>
<p>Of course, if the agent can observe the reward, the environment is no longer partially observable (though we can imagine the reward is delayed until later). And the general policy of ""alternate A and B"" is more effective that the 0.5A + 0.5B policy. Still, that stochastic policy is the best of the memoryless policies available in this POMDP.</p>",Stuart_Armstrong,stuart_armstrong,Stuart_Armstrong,

<p>I care about the current and future state of humanity, so I think it's good to work on existential or global catastrophic risk. Since I've studied computer science at a university until last year, I decided to work on AI safety. Currently I'm a research student at Kagoshima University doing exactly that. Before April this year I had only little experience with AI or ML. Therefore, I'm slowly digging through books and articles in order to be able to do research.<br /><br />I'm living off my savings. My research student time will end in March 2017 and my savings will run out some time after that. Nevertheless, I want to continue AI safety research, or at least work on X or GC risk.<br /><br />I see three ways of doing this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Continue full-time research and get paid/funded by someone.</li>
<li>Continue research part-time and work the other part of the time in order to get money. This work would most likely be programming (since I like it and am good at it). I would prefer work that helps humanity effectively.</li>
<li>Work full-time on something that helps humanity effectively.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />Oh, and I need to be location-independent or based in Kagoshima.<br /><br />I know http://futureoflife.org/job-postings/, but all of the job postings fail me in two ways: not location-independent and requiring more/different experience than I have.<br /><br />Can anyone here help me? If yes, I would be happy to provide more information about myself.<br /><br />(Note that I think I'm not in a precarious situation, because I would be able to get a remote software development job fairly easily. Just not in AI safety or X or GC risk.)</p>",rmoehn,rmoehn,rmoehn,

3pZunJQdD6g7NfCnm,Two forms of procrastination,two-forms-of-procrastination,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/3pZunJQdD6g7NfCnm/two-forms-of-procrastination,2016-07-16T20:30:55.911Z,22,12,13,False,False,,"<p>I noticed something about myself when comparing two forms of procrastination:<br /><br />a) reading online discussions,<br />b) watching movies online.<br /><br />Reading online discussions (LessWrong, SSC, Reddit, Facebook) and sometimes writing a comment there, is a huge sink of time for me. On the other hand, watching movies online is almost harmless, at least compared with the former option. The difference is obvious when I compare my productivity at the end of the day when I did only the former, or only the latter. The interesting thing is that <em>at the moment</em> it feels the other way round.<br /><br />When I start watching a movie that is 1:30:00 long, or start watching a series where each part is 40:00 long but I know I will probably watch more than one part a day, I am aware from the beginning that I am going to lose <em>more than one hour</em> of time; possibly several hours. On the other hand, when I open the ""Discussion"" tab on LessWrong, the latest ""Open Thread"" on SSC, my few favorite subreddits, and/or my Facebook ""Home"" page, it feels like it will only take <em>a few minutes</em> -- I will click on the few interesting links, quickly skim through the text, and maybe write a comment or two -- it certainly feels like much less than an hour.<br /><br />But the fact is, when I start reading the discussions, I will probably click on at least <em>hundred</em> links. Most of the pages I will read just as quickly as I imagined, but there will be a few that will take disproportionally <em>more</em> time; either because they are interesting and long, or because they contain further interesting <em>links</em>. And writing a comment sometimes takes more time than it seems; it can easily be a half an hour for a three-paragraphs-long comment. (Ironically, this specific article gets written rather quickly, because I know what I want to write, and I write it directly. But there are comments where I think a lot, and keep correcting my text, to avoid misunderstanding when debating a sensitive topic, etc.) And when I stop doing it, because I want to make something productive for a change, I will feel <em>tired</em>. Reading many different things, trying to read quickly, and formulating my answers, that all makes me <em>mentally exhausted</em>. So after I close the browser, I just wish I could take a nap.<br /><br />On the other hand, watching a movie does not make me tired in that specific way. The movies runs at its own speed and doesn't require me to do anything actively. Also, there is no sense of urgency; none of the ""if I reply to this <em>now</em>, people will notice and respond, but if I do it a week later, no one will care anymore"". So I feel perfectly comfortable pausing the movie at any moment, doing something productive for a while, then unpausing the movie and watching more. I know I won't miss anything.<br /><br />I think it's the mental <em>activity</em> during my procrastination that both makes me tired <em>and</em> creates the illusion that it will take <em>less</em> time than it actually does. When the movie says 1:30:00, I know it will be 1:30:00 (or maybe a little less because of the final credits). With a web page, I can always tell myself ""don't worry, I will read this one <em>really fast</em>"", so there is the illusion that I have it <em>under control</em>, and <em>can</em> reduce the time waste. The fact that I am reading an individual page really fast makes me underestimate how much time it took to read <em>all</em> those pages.<br /><br />On the other hand, sometimes I do inverse procrastination -- I start watching a movie, pause it a dozen times and do some useful work during the breaks -- and at the end of the day I spent maybe 90% of the time working productively, while my brain tells me I just spent the whole day watching a movie, so I almost feel like I had a free day.<br /><br />Okay, so how could I use this knowledge to improve my productivity?<br /><br />1) Knowing the difference between the two forms of procrastination, whenever I feel a desire to escape to the online world, I should start watching a movie instead of reading some debate, because thus I will waste <em>less</em> time, even if it feels the other way round.<br /><br />2) Integrate it with pomodoro? 10 minutes movie, 50 minutes work, then again, and at the end of the day my lying brain will tell me ""dude, you didn't work at all today, <em>you were just watching movies</em>, of course you should feel awesome!"".<br /><br />Do you have a similar experience? No idea how typical is this. No need to hurry with responding, I am going to watch a movie now. ;-)</p>",Viliam,viliam,Viliam,

<p>It is known that utility functions are equivalent (i.e. produce the same preferences over actions) up to a positive affine transformation: u'(x) = au(x) + b where a is positive.</p>
<p>Suppose I have u(vanilla) = 3, u(chocolate) = 8. I prefer an action that yields a 50% chance of chocolate over an action that yields a 100% chance of vanilla, because 0.5(8) &gt; 1.0(3).</p>
<p>Under the positive affine transformation a = 1, b = 4; we get that u'(vanilla) = 7 and u'(chocolate) = 12. Therefore I now prefer the action that yields a 100% chance of vanilla, because 1.0(7) &gt; 0.5(12).</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<p>I'm recently doing a big project to increase my scholarship and modeling power for both rationality and traditional ""serious"" topics. One thing I found very useful is taking notes with a clear structure.</p>
<p>The structure I'm using currently is as follows:</p>
<p>- write down useful concepts,</p>
<p>- write down (as a separate category) useful heuristics &amp; things to do in various situations,</p>
<p>- do not write facts, opinions or anything else (I rely on unaided memory to get more filtering).</p>
<p><strong>Heuristic: learn concepts before facts!</strong></p>
<p>Note that you can be mistaken about facts, but you can't harm your epistemology by learning concepts. Even if a concept turns out to be useless or misleading, you are better off knowing about it, understanding how it's misleading, and being able to avoid the trap when you see it.</p>
<p><strong>Let's share concepts!</strong></p>
<p>Please give (at a minimum) a name and a reference (link). A short description in plain language is also welcome.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Model</h3>
<p>The information we get from others can not always be 100% relied upon. &nbsp;Some of the people telling you stuff are liars, some are stupid, and some are incorrectly or insufficiently informed. &nbsp;Even in the case where the person giving you an opinion is honest, smart and well informed, they are still unlikely to be able to tell you accurately how reliable their own opinion is.</p>
<p>So our brains use an 'unreliability' factor. &nbsp;Automatically we take what others tell us, and discount it by a certain amount, depending on how 'unreliable' we estimate the source to be.</p>
<p>We also compare what people tell us about 'known reference points' in order to update our estimates of their unreliability.</p>
<p>If Sally tells me that vaccines cause AIDS and I am very much more certain that this is not the case, than I am of Sally's reliability, then instead of modifying my opinion about what causes AIDS, I modify my opinion of how reliable Sally is.</p>
<p>If I'm only slightly more certain, then I might take the step of asking Sally her reason for thinking that, and looking at her data.</p>
<p>If I have a higher opinion of Sally than my own knowledge of science, and I don't much care or am unaware of what other people think about the relationship between vaccines and AIDS, then I might just accept what she says, provisionally, without checking her data.</p>
<p>If I have a very much higher opinion of Sally, then not only will I believe her, but my opinion of her reliability will actually increase as I assess her as some mould-breaking genius who knows things that others do not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Importantly, once we have altered our opinion, based upon input that we originally considered to be fairly reliable, we are very bad at reversing that alteration, if the input later turns out to be less reliable than we originally thought. &nbsp;This is called the ""<em style=""color: #252525; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.4px;""><span id=""continued_influence_effect"">continued influence effect</span></em>"", and we can use it to explain a number of things...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Experiment</h3>
<p>Let us consider a thought experiment where two subjects, Peter and Paul, are exposed to input about a particular topic (such as ""Which clothes washing powder is it best to use?"") from multiple sources. &nbsp; Both will be exposed to the same sources, 100 in favour of using the <em>Persil</em> brand of washing powder, and 100 in favour of using the <em>Bold</em> brand of washing powder, but in a different order.</p>
<p>If they both start off with no strong opinion in either direction, would we expect them to end the experiment with roughly the same opinion as each other, or can we manipulate their opinions into differing, just by changing the order in which the sources are presented?</p>
<p>Suppose, with Peter, we start him off with 10 of the Persil side's most reputable and well argued sources, to raise Peter's confidence in sources that support Persil.</p>
<p>We can then run another 30 much weaker pro-Persil sources past him, and he is likely to just nods and accept, without bothering to examine the validity of the arguments too closely, because he's already convinced.</p>
<p>At this point, when he'll consider a source to be a bit suspect, straight away, just because they don't support Persil, we introduce him to the pro-Bold side, starting with the least reliable - the ones that are obviously stupid or manipulative. &nbsp; Further more, we don't let the pro-Bold side build up momentum. &nbsp; For every three poor pro-Bold sources, we interrupt with a medium reliability pro-Persil source that's rehashing pro-Persil points that Peter is by now familiar with and agrees with.</p>
<p>After seeing the worst 30 pro-Bold sources, Peter now don't just consider them to be a bit suspect - he considers them to be down right deceptive and mentally categorises all such sources as not worth paying attention to. &nbsp; Any further pro-Bold sources, even ones that seem to be impartial and well reasoned, he's going to put down as being fakes created by malicious researchers in the pay of an evil company.</p>
<p>We can now, safely, expose Peter to the medium-reliability pro-Bold sources and even the good ones, and will need less and less to refute them, just a reminder to Peter of 'which side he is on', because it is less about the data now, and more about identity - he doesn't see himself as the sort of person who'd support Bold. &nbsp; He's not a sheep. &nbsp;He's not taken in by the hoax.</p>
<p>Finally, after 80 pro-Persil sources and 90 pro-Bold sources, we have 10 excellent pro-Bold sources whose independence and science can't fairly be questioned. &nbsp; But it is too late for them to have much effect, and there are 20 good pro-Persil sources to balance them.</p>
<p>For Paul we do the reverse, starting with pro-Bold sources and only later introducing the pro-Persil side once a known reference point has been established as an anchor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Simulation</h3>
<p>Obviously, things are rarely that clear cut in real life. &nbsp; But people also don't often get data from both sides of an argument at a precisely equal rate. &nbsp; They bump around randomly, and once one side accumulates some headway, it is unlikely to be reversed.</p>
<p>We could add a third subject, Mary, and consider what is likely to happen if she is exposed to a random succession of sources, each with a 50% chance of supporting one side or the other, and each with a random value on a scale of 1(poor) to 3 (good) for honesty, validity and strength of conclusion supported by the claimed data.</p>
<p>If we use mathematics to make some actual models of the points at which a source agreeing or disagreeing with you affects your estimate of their reliability, we can use a computer simulation of the above thought experiment to predict how different orders of presentation will affect people's final opinion, under each model. &nbsp; Then we could compare that against real-world data, to see which model best matches reality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Prediction</h3>
<p>I think, if this experiment were carried out, one of the properties that would emerge naturally from it is <em>the backfire effect</em>:</p>
<p>"" The backfire effect occurs when, in the face of contradictory evidence, established beliefs do not change but actually get stronger. The effect has been demonstrated experimentally in psychological tests, where subjects are given data that either reinforces or goes against their existing biases - and in most cases people can be shown to increase their confidence in their prior position regardless of the evidence they were faced with. ""</p>

<h2 id=""summary"">Summary</h2>
<p>The summary is not intended to be comprehensive. It highlights the most important takeaways you should get from this post.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Vipul Naik and I are interested in understanding how people use Wikipedia. One reason is that we are getting more people to work on editing and adding content to Wikipedia. We want to understand the impact of these edits, so that we can direct efforts more strategically. We are also curious!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From May to July 2016, we conducted two surveys of people&rsquo;s Wikipedia usage. We collected survey responses from audience segments include Slate Star Codex readers, Vipul&rsquo;s Facebook friends, and a few audiences through SurveyMonkey Audience and Google Consumer Surveys. Our survey questions measured how heavily people use Wikipedia, what sort of pages they read or expected to find, the relation between their search habits and Wikipedia, and other actions they took within Wikipedia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Different audience segments responded very differently to the survey. Notably, the SurveyMonkey audience (which is closer to being representative of the general population) appears to use Wikipedia a lot less than Vipul&rsquo;s Facebook friends and Slate Star Codex readers. Their consumption of Wikipedia is also more passive: they are less likely to explicitly seek Wikipedia pages when searching for a topic, and less likely to engage in additional actions on Wikipedia pages. Even the college-educated SurveyMonkey audience used Wikipedia very little.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is tentative evidence that Wikipedia consumption is skewed towards a certain profile of people (and Vipul&rsquo;s Facebook friends and Slate Star Codex readers sample much more heavily from that profile). Even more tentatively, these heavy users tend to be more &ldquo;elite&rdquo; and influential. This tentatively led us to revise upward our estimates of the social value of a Wikipedia pageview.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This was my first exercise in survey construction. I learned a number of lessons about survey design in the process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All the survey questions, as well as the breakdown of responses for each of the audience segments, are described in this post. Links to PDF exports of response summaries are at the end of the post.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id=""background"">Background</h2>
<p>At the end of May 2016, <a href=""/user/VipulNaik/overview/"">Vipul Naik</a> and I created a <a title=""Vipul Naik and Issa Rice. &quot;Research:Wikipedia usage survey&quot;. May 31, 2016. Wikimedia Meta Wiki."" href=""https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research:Wikipedia_usage_survey"">Wikipedia usage survey</a> to gauge the usage habits of Wikipedia readers and editors. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SurveyMonkey"">SurveyMonkey</a> allows the use of different &ldquo;collectors&rdquo; (i.e.&nbsp;survey URLs that keep results separate), so we circulated several different URLs among four locations to see how different audiences would respond. The audiences were as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>SurveyMonkey&rsquo;s United States audience with no demographic filters (62 responses, 54 of which are full responses)</li>
<li>Vipul Naik&rsquo;s timeline (<a title=""Vipul Naik. May 30, 2016. Archived at http://archive.is/M35mf."" href=""https://www.facebook.com/vipulnaik.r/posts/10208540131276697"">post asking people to take the survey</a>; 70 responses, 69 of which are full responses). For background on Vipul&rsquo;s timeline audience, see <a title=""Vipul Naik. &quot;Facebook&quot;."" href=""http://vipulnaik.com/facebook/"">his page on how he uses Facebook</a>.</li>
<li>The <a title=""Wikimedia. &quot;Analytics&quot;."" href=""https://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/analytics"">Wikipedia Analytics mailing list</a> (<a title=""Vipul Naik. &quot;Survey for Wikipedia readers&quot;. May 31, 2016. Analytics mailing list."" href=""https://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/analytics/2016-May/005219.html"">email linking to the survey</a>; 7 responses, 6 of which are full responses). Note that due to the small size of this group, the results below should not be trusted, unless possibly when the votes are decisive.</li>
<li>Slate Star Codex (<a title=""Scott Alexander. &quot;Links 6/16: Linkandescence&quot;. June 2, 2016. Slate Star Codex."" href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/06/02/links-616-linkandescence/"">post that links to the survey</a>; 618 responses, 596 of which are full responses). While Slate Star Codex isn&rsquo;t the same as LessWrong, we think there is significant overlap in the two sites&rsquo; audiences (see e.g. <a title=""ingres. &quot;2016 LessWrong Diaspora Survey Analysis: Part Two (LessWrong Use, Successorship, Diaspora)&quot;. June 10, 2016. LessWrong."" href=""/lw/nor/2016_lesswrong_diaspora_survey_analysis_part_two/"">the recent LessWrong diaspora survey results</a>).</li>
<li>In addition, although not an actual audience with a separate URL, several of the tables we present below will include an &ldquo;H&rdquo; group; this is the heavy users group of people who responded by saying they read 26 or more articles per week on Wikipedia. This group has 179 people: 164 from Slate Star Codex, 11 from Vipul&rsquo;s timeline, and 4 from the Analytics mailing list.</li>
</ul>
<p>We ran the survey from May 30 to July 9, 2016 (although only the Slate Star Codex survey had a response past June 1).</p>
<p>After we looked at the survey responses on the first day, Vipul and I decided to create a second survey to focus on the parts from the first survey that interested us the most. The second survey was only circulated among SurveyMonkey&rsquo;s audiences: we used SurveyMonkey&rsquo;s US audience with no demographic filters (54 responses), as well as a US audience of ages 18&ndash;29 with a college or graduate degree (50 responses). We first ran the survey on the unfiltered audience again because the wording of our first question was changed and we wanted to have the new baseline. We then chose to filter for young college-educated people because our prediction was that more educated people would be more likely to read Wikipedia (the SurveyMonkey demographic data does not include education, and we hadn&rsquo;t seen the Pew Internet Research surveys in the next section, so we were relying on our intuition and some demographic data from past surveys) and because young people in our first survey gave more informative free-form responses in survey 2 (SurveyMonkey&rsquo;s demographic data <em>does</em> include age).</p>
<p>We ran a third survey on Google Consumer Surveys with a <em>single question</em> that was a word-to-word replica of the first question from the second survey. The main motivation here was that on Google Consumer Surveys, a single-question survey costs only 10 cents per response, so it was possible to get to a large number of responses at relatively low cost, and achieve more confidence in the tentative conclusions we had drawn from the SurveyMonkey surveys.</p>
<h2 id=""previous-surveys"">Previous surveys</h2>
<p>Several demographic surveys regarding Wikipedia have been conducted, targeting both editors and users. The surveys we found most helpful were the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20130717211630/http://wikipediastudy.org/"">2010 Wikipedia survey</a> by the Collaborative Creativity Group and the Wikimedia Foundation. The explanation before the bottom table on page 7 of the <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20131209060146/http://wikipediastudy.org/docs/Wikipedia_Overview_15March2010-FINAL.pdf"">overview PDF</a> has &ldquo;Contributors show slightly but significantly higher education levels than readers&rdquo;, which provides weak evidence that more educated people are more likely to engage with Wikipedia.</li>
<li>The <a href=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/Global_South_User_Survey_2014_-_Full_Analysis_Report.pdf"">Global South User Survey 2014</a> by the Wikimedia Foundation</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.pewinternet.org/files/old-media/Files/Reports/2011/PIP_Wikipedia.pdf"">Pew Internet Research&rsquo;s 2011 survey</a>: &ldquo;Education level continues to be the strongest predictor of Wikipedia use. The collaborative encyclopedia is most popular among internet users with at least a college degree, 69% of whom use the site.&rdquo; (page 3)</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.pewinternet.org/2007/04/24/wikipedia-users/"">Pew Internet Research&rsquo;s 2007 survey</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that we found the Pew Internet Research surveys after conducting our own two surveys (and during the write-up of this document).</p>
<h2 id=""motivation"">Motivation</h2>
<p>Vipul and I ultimately want to get a better sense of the value of a Wikipedia pageview (one way to measure the impact of content creation), and one way to do this is to understand how people are using Wikipedia. As we focus on <a title=""Vipul Naik. May 28, 2016. Archived at http://archive.is/jyuqC."" href=""https://www.facebook.com/vipulnaik.r/posts/10208522775642817"">getting more people to work on editing Wikipedia</a> &ndash; thus causing more people to read the content we pay and help to create &ndash; it becomes more important to understand what people are doing on the site.</p>
<p>For some previous discussion, see also Vipul&rsquo;s answers to the following Quora questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><a title=""April 16, 2016."" href=""https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-various-parameters-that-affect-the-value-of-a-pageview/answer/Vipul-Naik"">What are the various parameters that affect the value of a pageview?</a></li>
<li><a title=""August 30, 2014."" href=""https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-relative-social-value-of-1-Quora-pageview-as-measured-by-Quora-stats-http-www-quora-com-stats-and-1-Wikipedia-pageview-as-measured-at-say-Wikipedia-article-traffic-statistics/answer/Vipul-Naik"">What&rsquo;s the relative social value of 1 Quora pageview (as measured by Quora stats http://www.quora.com/stats) and 1 Wikipedia pageview (as measured at, say, Wikipedia article traffic statistics)?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Wikipedia allows relatively easy access to pageview data (especially by using tools developed for this purpose, including <a href=""http://wikipediaviews.org/"">one that Vipul made</a>), and there are some surveys that provide demographic data (see <a href=""#previous-surveys"">&ldquo;Previous surveys&rdquo;</a> above). However, after looking around, it was apparent that the kind of information our survey was designed to find was not available.</p>
<p>I should also note that we were driven by our curiosity of how people use Wikipedia.</p>
<h2 id=""survey-questions-for-the-first-survey"">Survey questions for the first survey</h2>
<p>For reference, here are the survey questions for the first survey. A dummy/mock-up version of the survey can be found here: <a class=""uri"" href=""https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/PDTTBM8"">https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/PDTTBM8</a>.</p>
<p>The survey introduction said the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This survey is intended to gauge Wikipedia use habits. This survey has 3 pages with 5 questions total (3 on the first page, 1 on the second page, 1 on the third page). Please try your best to answer all of the questions, and make a guess if you&rsquo;re not sure.</p>

<li>Share the page with a friend/acquaintance/coworker</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For the SurveyMonkey audience, there were also some demographic questions (age, gender, household income, US region, and device type).</p>
<h2 id=""survey-questions-for-the-second-survey"">Survey questions for the second survey</h2>
<p>For reference, here are the survey questions for the second survey. A dummy/mock-up version of the survey can be found here: <a class=""uri"" href=""https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/28BW78V"">https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/28BW78V</a>.</p>
<p>The survey introduction said the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This survey is intended to gauge Wikipedia use habits. Please try your best to answer all of the questions, and make a guess if you&rsquo;re not sure.</p>
<p>This survey has 4 questions across 3 pages.</p>
<p>In this survey, &ldquo;Wikipedia page&rdquo; refers to a Wikipedia page in any language (not just the English Wikipedia).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the actual questions:</p>
<ol style=""list-style-type: decimal"">
<li>
<p>How many distinct Wikipedia pages do you read (at least one sentence of) per week on average?</p>
<ul>
<li>Fewer than 1</li>
<li>1 to 10</li>
<li>11 to 25</li>
<li>26 or more</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which of these articles have you read (at least one sentence of) on Wikipedia (select all that apply)? (These were displayed in a random order except the last option for each respondent, but displayed in alphabetical order except the last option here.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Adele</li>
<li>Barack Obama</li>
<li>Bernie Sanders</li>

<li>None of the above</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are some of the Wikipedia articles you have most recently read (at least one sentence of)? Feel free to consult your browser&rsquo;s history.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recall a time when you were surprised that a topic did not have a Wikipedia page. What were some of these topics?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=""survey-questions-for-the-third-survey-google-consumer-surveys"">Survey questions for the third survey (Google Consumer Surveys)</h2>
<p>This survey had exactly one question. The wording of the question was exactly the same as that of the first question of the second survey.</p>
<ol style=""list-style-type: decimal"">
<li>
<p>How many distinct Wikipedia pages do you read (at least one sentence of) per week on average?</p>
<ul>
<li>Fewer than 1</li>
<li>1 to 10</li>
<li>11 to 25</li>
<li>26 or more</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>One slight difference was that whereas in the second survey, the order of the options was fixed, the third survey did a 50/50 split between that order and the exact reverse order. Such splitting is a best practice to deal with any order-related biases, while still preserving the logical order of the options.

</table>
<p>Here are some highlights from the first question that aren&rsquo;t apparent from the table:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Of the people who read fewer than 1 distinct Wikipedia page per week (26 people), 68% were female even though females were only 48% of the respondents. (Note that gender data is only available for the SurveyMonkey audience.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Filtering for high household income ($150k or more; 11 people) in the SurveyMonkey audience, only 2 read fewer than 1 page per week, although most (7) of the responses still fall in the &ldquo;1 to 10&rdquo; category.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The comments indicated that this question was flawed in several ways: we didn&rsquo;t specify which language Wikipedias count nor what it meant to &ldquo;read&rdquo; an article (the whole page, a section, or just a sentence?). One comment questioned the &ldquo;low&rdquo; ceiling of 26; in fact, I had initially made the cutoffs 1, 10, 100, 500, and 1000, but Vipul suggested the final cutoffs because he argued they would make it easier for people to answer (without having to look it up in their browser history). It turned out this modification was reasonable because the &ldquo;26 or more&rdquo; group was a minority.</p>
<h3 id=""s1q2-affinity-for-wikipedia-in-search-results"">S1Q2: affinity for Wikipedia in search results</h3>
<p>We asked Q2, &ldquo;On a search engine (e.g.&nbsp;Google) results page, do you explicitly seek Wikipedia pages, or do you passively click on Wikipedia pages only if they show up at the top of the results?&rdquo;, to see to what extent people preferred Wikipedia in search results. The main implication to this for people who do content creation on Wikipedia is that if people do explicitly seek Wikipedia pages (for whatever reason), it makes sense to give them more of what they want. On the other hand, if people don&rsquo;t prefer Wikipedia, it makes sense to update in favor of diversifying one&rsquo;s content creation efforts while still keeping in mind that raw pageviews indicate that content will be read more if placed on Wikipedia (see for instance <a title=""Brian Tomasik. &quot;The Value of Wikipedia Contributions in Social Sciences&quot; &sect; Readership. 2015. Essays on Reducing Suffering."" href=""http://reducing-suffering.org/the-value-of-wikipedia-contributions-in-social-sciences/#Readership"">Brian Tomasik&rsquo;s experience</a>, which is similar to my own, or <a title=""gwern branwen. &quot;Wikipedia and Other Wikis&quot;.

<p>One error on my part was that I didn&rsquo;t include an option for people who avoided Wikipedia or did something else. This became apparent from the comments. For this reason, the &ldquo;Just click on top results&rdquo; options might be inflated. In addition, some comments indicated a mixed strategy of preferring Wikipedia for general overviews while avoiding it for specific inquiries, so allowing multiple selections might have been better for this question.</p>
<h3 id=""s1q3-section-vs-whole-page"">S1Q3: section vs whole page</h3>
<p>This question is relevant for Vipul and me because the <a title=""Vipul Naik. &quot;List of new articles that any interested author can work on&quot;. GitHub."" href=""https://github.com/vipulnaik/working-drafts/blob/master/new-article-pool.mediawiki"">work Vipul funds</a> is mainly whole-page creation. If people are mostly reading the introduction or a particular section like the &ldquo;Criticisms&rdquo; or &ldquo;Reception&rdquo; section (see <a href=""#s1q5-behavior-on-pages"">S1Q5</a>), then that forces us to consider spending more time on those sections, or to strengthen those sections on weak existing pages.</p>

<p>Many people noted here that rather than using Wikipedia&rsquo;s search functionality, they use Google with &ldquo;wiki&rdquo; attached to their query, DuckDuckGo&rsquo;s &ldquo;!w&rdquo; expression, or some browser configuration to allow a quick search on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>To be more thorough about discovering people&rsquo;s content discovery methods, we should have asked about other methods as well. We did ask about the &ldquo;See also&rdquo; section in <a href=""#s1q5-behavior-on-pages"">S1Q5</a>.</p>
<p>Next, we asked how often people are surprised that there is no Wikipedia page on a topic to gauge to what extent people notice a &ldquo;gap&rdquo; between how Wikipedia exists today and how it <em>could</em> exist. We were curious about what articles people specifically found missing, so we followed up with <a href=""#s2q4-free-response-of-surprise-at-lack-of-wikipedia-pages"">S2Q4</a>.</p>

In general, the more common actions (scores of 2.5&ndash;4) had responses that clustered among &ldquo;For some pages&rdquo;, &ldquo;For very few pages&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Never&rdquo;, while the less common actions (scores above 4) had responses that clustered mainly in &ldquo;Never&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Comparing SM with S1SM, we see that probably because of the wording, the percentages have drifted in the direction of more pages read. It might be surprising that the young educated audience seems to have a smaller fraction of heavy users than the general population. However note that each group only had ~50 responses, and that we have no education information for the SM group.</p>

<p>Below are four plots of the data. Note that r_s denotes <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spearman%27s_rank_correlation_coefficient"">Spearman&rsquo;s rank correlation coefficient</a>. Spearman&rsquo;s rank correlation coefficient is used instead of Pearson&rsquo;s <em>r</em> because the former is less affected by outliers. Note also that the percentage of respondents who viewed a page counts each respondent once, whereas the number of pageviews does not have this restriction (i.e.&nbsp;duplicate pageviews count), so we wouldn&rsquo;t expect the relationship to be entirely linear even if the survey audiences were perfectly representative of the general population.</p>

<h3 id=""s2q3-free-response-of-articles-read"">S2Q3: free response of articles read</h3>
<p>The most common response was along the lines of &ldquo;None&rdquo;, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&rdquo;, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember&rdquo;, or similar. Among the more useful responses were:</p>
<ul>
<li>News stories (e.g. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Harambe"">Death of Harambe</a>, &ldquo;WikiLeaks scandal&rdquo; &ndash; unclear which page this is, since there are several pages on various aspects of WikiLeaks)</li>

<h3 id=""s2q4-free-response-of-surprise-at-lack-of-wikipedia-pages"">S2Q4: free response of surprise at lack of Wikipedia pages</h3>
<p>As with the previous question, the most common response was along the lines of &ldquo;None&rdquo;, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&rdquo;, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember&rdquo;, &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t happen&rdquo;, or similar.</p>
<p>The most useful responses were classes of things: &ldquo;particular words&rdquo;, &ldquo;French plays/books&rdquo;, &ldquo;Random people&rdquo;, &ldquo;obscure people&rdquo;, &ldquo;Specific list pages of movie genres&rdquo;, &ldquo;Foreign actors&rdquo;, &ldquo;various insect pages&rdquo;, and so forth.</p>
<h3 id=""s3q1-google-consumer-surveys"">S3Q1 (Google Consumer Surveys)</h3>
<p>The survey was circulated to a target size of 500 in the United States (no demographic filters), and received 501 responses.</p>
<p>Since there was only one question, but we obtained data filtered by demographics in many different ways, we present this table with the columns denoting responses and the rows denoting the audience segments. We also include the S1Q1SM, S2Q1SM, and S2Q1CEYP responses for easy comparison. Note that S1Q1SM did not include the &ldquo;at least one sentence of&rdquo; caveat. We believe that adding this caveat would push people&rsquo;s estimates upward.</p>
<p>If you view the Google Consumer Surveys results <a href=""https://www.google.com/insights/consumersurveys/view?survey=o3iworx2rcfixmn2x5shtlppci&amp;question=1&amp;filter=&amp;rw=1"">online</a> you will also see the 95% confidence intervals for each of the segments. Note that percentages in a row may not add up to 100% due to rounding or due to people entering &ldquo;Other&rdquo; responses. For the entire GCS audience, every pair of options had a statistically significant difference, but for some subsegments, this was not true.</p>

<p>We can see that the overall GCS data vindicates the broad conclusions we drew from SurveyMonkey data. Moreover, most GCS segments with a sufficiently large number of responses (50 or more) display a similar trend as the overall data. One exception is that younger audiences seem to be slightly less likely to use Wikipedia very little (i.e.&nbsp;fall in the &ldquo;Fewer than 1&rdquo; category), and older audiences seem slightly more likely to use Wikipedia very little.</p>

<h2 id=""survey-making-lessons"">Survey-making lessons</h2>
<p>Not having any experience designing surveys, and wanting some rough results quickly, I decided not to look into survey-making best practices beyond the feedback from Vipul. As the first survey progressed, it became clear that there were several deficiencies in that survey:</p>
<ul>
<li>Question 1 did not specify what counts as reading a page.</li>
<li>We did not specify which language Wikipedias we were considering (multiple people noted how they read other language Wikipedias other than the English Wikipedia).</li>
<li>Question 2 did not include an option for people who avoid Wikipedia or do something else entirely.</li>
<li>We did not include an option to allow people to release their survey results.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=""further-questions"">Further questions</h2>
<p>The two surveys we&rsquo;ve done so far provide some insight into how people use Wikipedia, but we are still far from understanding the value of Wikipedia pageviews. Some remaining questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Could it be possible that even on non-obscure topics, most of the views are by &ldquo;elites&rdquo; (i.e.&nbsp;those with outsized impact on the world)? This could mean pageviews are more valuable than previously thought.</li>
<li>On S2Q1, why did our data show that CEYP was less engaged with Wikipedia than SM? Is this a limitation of the small number of responses or of SurveyMonkey&rsquo;s audiences?</li>

7aJAKXT8nKeiKx6fb,Iterating hurt,iterating-hurt,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7aJAKXT8nKeiKx6fb/iterating-hurt,2016-07-14T15:00:06.000Z,1,0,0,False,False,,"<p>A truish story with all names and many circumstances altered:</p>
<blockquote><p>Alice and Bob were friends, but their friendship had seen some rough patches recently due to an ill-advised business experiment and some ensuing uncomfortable feelings. Today they were co-working, with the intent of mending whatever was broken through dedicated inattention. The two of them sat down in Alice&#8217;s kitchen. Bob took out paper, pens, and a loud bell. He picked up the bell and proceeded to pace back and forth across the room jangling it with the vigor of two arms and staring into space.</p>
<p>It turned out that Alice loved the sound of loudly jangling bells, which reminded her of the beautiful church she used to live next to. And she was working on her own general solution to coordination problems—a puzzle so fascinating that she could not possibly be distracted, even by the delightful bell song. So the noise caused Alice no suffering.</p>
<p>However, Alice reasoned that Bob had no way of knowing that she would not be harmed, and that he really should have expected that his bell-ringing would annoy her a lot in expectation. So she had little choice but to infer that Bob didn&#8217;t care about hurting her. And that did hurt.</p>
<p>Furthermore, she reasoned that Bob must be aware that she would be hurt by observing that he didn&#8217;t care about hurting her. So he should have anticipated not only some suffering in expectation from the bell, but also this second level of more certain suffering from observing Bob&#8217;s indifference. Knowing that he was happy to deal her even <em>that much</em> suffering was even worse. And furthermore he didn&#8217;t even care about this extra suffering!</p>
<p>On top of that, she reasoned, once there is enough common knowledge of enough certainty of enough suffering willingly inflicted, Bob can&#8217;t be doing this by accident. It becomes an intentional affront. A message of hatred, rather than an inadvertent sign of indifference.</p>
<p>She became extremely angry and marched out of the front door.</p>
<p>(Bob made a mental note that Alice really didn&#8217;t like bell sounds.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Knowing that someone knowingly hurt you is hurtful. And knowing that someone knowingly hurt you by indirectly causing you to know that they knowingly hurt you is hurtful. And so on.</p>
<p>I suggest that social injury often has this character of being magnified iteratively by approaching common knowledge.</p>
<p>Perfectly legitimate offense doesn&#8217;t even need to stand on the ground at all. Suppose that I like being slapped in the face. Also, I know that you know this. But I also know that you <em>don&#8217;t know</em> that I know that you know that I like being slapped in the face. Then you slap me in the face. I&#8217;ve got to figure you are willingly harming me with your seeming desire to harm me, even if you don&#8217;t think I will actually mind the slap per se. Alice was reasonable to be upset, even though she liked the bell sound.</p>
<p>I expect something similar can happen at a group level. There is an action that hurts a small fraction of some group of people. Then doing it indicates that you are fine with a chance of hurting people from that group, which hurts the feelings of the whole group, and causes enmity with whatever groups you are saliently a member of. Then if people continue to do the action, the victim group takes it as an even larger sign of disrespect and at some point an intentional slight. Then even if the action ceases to hurt anybody on the object level, or is replaced altogether by things that are thematically similar but not object-level harmful, it has become a slight, and continues to hurt, because <a href=""https://meteuphoric.wordpress.com/2010/05/04/connotations-are%c2%a0indelible/"">connotations are hard to erase</a>. I don&#8217;t really know if this happens—I don&#8217;t keep up with current offense. More informed opinions welcome.</p>
<p>This theory predicts that actions would often be offensive in spite of probably not directly harming anyone on the object level. I think this does happen. I also guess that it leads to some confusion around whether other people are just pretending to be offended. (I also expect people sometimes <em>are</em> pretending to be offended, because often there are incentives to, and at least some people respond to incentives sometimes).</p>
<p>I also wonder if something like this explains why people jump on random insensitive statements that weakly suggest offensive views, <a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/06/17/against-dog-whistles/"">even when there is</a> no chance that the person holds the offensive view in question. If I really believed that someone thought I was good at drawing, but I also heard them accidentally momentarily imply to someone else that my drawings were rubbish, I would figure that they weren&#8217;t very interested in whether this might hurt me. Also that they might be trying to intentionally anger me. And people intentionally trying to anger me can be angering.</p>
<p>I posit that offense should almost always be out of proportion to the action that caused it. Hurtful actions automatically snowball into being more hurtful, and the offense of the victim is a response to the hurt accrued by the time the snowball lands.</p><br />  <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/10955/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/10955/"" /></a> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/10955/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/delicious/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/10955/"" /></a> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gofacebook/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/10955/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/facebook/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/10955/"" /></a> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gotwitter/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/10955/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/twitter/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/10955/"" /></a> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/10955/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/stumble/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/10955/"" /></a> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/10955/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/digg/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/10955/"" /></a> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/10955/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/reddit/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/10955/"" /></a> <img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=meteuphoric.wordpress.com&#038;blog=8643840&#038;post=10955&#038;subd=meteuphoric&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1"" width=""1"" height=""1"" />",KatjaGrace,katjagrace,KatjaGrace,

jGYwRbaynvYTFL9kF,Suggestion: jog instead of walk,suggestion-jog-instead-of-walk,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/jGYwRbaynvYTFL9kF/suggestion-jog-instead-of-walk,2016-07-13T17:34:25.666Z,7,10,6,False,False,,"<p>A bit of background: my manager literally runs around the office when she needs something so she can return to her desk asap. While watching her one day I thought about trying my own experiment of jogging from place to place.</p>
<p>I chose jogging instead of running as I figured the expenditure of energy and anaerobic respiration required for a full on run/sprint would take too much energy for the seconds saved and distance traveled, while jogging would feel a more natural transition of energy and still save some time.</p>
<p>So far, the only 'drawback' I've seen is the occasional confused look from a passerby (truthfully though, most people don't seem to care). Comparing this to the increase of overall energy and positive emotion I've felt, it's been well worth it. There also might be times and places where jogging would be inappropriate, so use discretion of course.</p>
<p>Also, you don't have to start out with jogging right away! I run daily anyway so that's why I transitioned right away. You could start with a brisker walk and work your way up.</p>
<p>If you do try it out, please feel free to let me know how it works out for you! :)</p>",,,,

<p>Social Meetups are casual get-togethers held on the third Friday of each month. They are informal events where we sit around and chat over a few drinks and a meal. Sometimes we will play games as well.</p>

<p><strong>Where?</strong> Bull &amp; Bear Tavern, 347 Flinders Lane, Melbourne</p>

<p><strong>When?</strong> Friday 17th June, starting from 6:30pm. Start time is loose so show up whenever. We are usually there until about 11pm.</p>

<p><strong>Dinner?</strong> The B&amp;B serves reasonable pub food and we will usually share some wedges or similar. A few of us typically go for a late dinner after the event. Recently we've been going to Father's Office which offers late night a la carte dining at half price.</p>

<p><strong>Contact?</strong> Any issues or questions, contact Richard on 0421231789.</p>

<p>Hope to see you there!</p></div>

<p><strong>Warning 1:</strong>&nbsp;This post is written in the form of Java-like pseudocode.</p>
<p>If you have no knowledge of programming, you might have trouble understanding it.</p>
<p>(If you do, it still does not guarantee you will understand, but your chances are better.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Warning 2: </strong>I have more than moderate, but less than high, confidence that this model is approximately correct.</p>
<p>It doesn't mean that my or anyone's brain works exactly in the way shown in the code, but rather that the flow of data in the brain is approximately as if it were using such an algorithm.</p>
<p>The word ""approximately"" includes stuff I don't (yet) know about, but also stuff I didn't include below to keep it simple.</p>
<p>I wrote this specifically for regrets, but processing of positive memories seems to have similar mechanics (with different constants).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Warning 3: </strong>There is little chance of finding any existing studies/data etc. that could directly validate or invalidate this model. (However if you know of any, I'm all ears.)</p>
<p>There might some stuff that is correlated, so if you know something mention it too.</p>

4AuCbSurFmBJotGZc,On liking things about crushes,on-liking-things-about-crushes,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4AuCbSurFmBJotGZc/on-liking-things-about-crushes,2016-07-07T12:00:38.000Z,1,0,0,False,False,,"<p>Sometimes I have had crushes on people, and then all kinds of miscellaneous characteristics they had seemed good. Not just their face or their sense of style or the exact way they pronounce my name. But also things that would usually be considered unattractive. For instance, if they are balding, I might suddenly find myself excited by sparse head stubble, when I had previously liked luxuriant hair. And then subsequently I would be more attracted to every other balding guy I met.</p>
<p>I think this is not just directly because the person having those characteristics makes the characteristics by association the most excellent characteristics a person could have. Though that is maybe part of it (your face reminds me of&#8230;you!)</p>
<p>I think it is also because I implicitly infer that the person in question likes those characteristics, and I expect people to like me more if I like the things they like. For instance, if they are grumpy and have crumpled clothes, I think I implicitly infer that they like people being grumpy and wearing crumpled clothes, and that if I favor those things too, it will help us be friends. And I can appreciate a pretty wide range of things, so I implicitly give attention to the ones that are helpful.</p>
<p>So I suppose that I must implicitly believe everyone likes almost all of their characteristics. Explicitly, I think this is unlikely to be true. Though I do expect people relate more to people who share their characteristics, whether or not they like the characteristics. So maybe that is what I&#8217;m implicitly going for.</p>
<p>All this leads me to think that that my brain is probably doing a milder version of the thing it does with crushes with respect to other people who I like in less extreme ways all the time. &#8220;Ooh—I guess you like being mildly irritated! I can do that too! Grr. Do you like me?&#8221; It is just only so strong as to be introspectively perceptible in the case of crushes. Which I guess matches the observation that people copy each other a lot.</p>
<p>I have long had the abstract impression that I should choose who I spend much time with carefully because company makes an alarmingly large difference to one&#8217;s own behavior. But the way that my brain updates on crushes makes that concern feel more viscerally real to me. Happily (not coincidentally) current company seems pretty good. Though unusual, so probably I don&#8217;t give things like religiosity and being athletic proper thought. These concerns are is not news, but a new angle from which to feel like it is actually a real problem and not just one of those problems that it would be virtuous to be troubled by.</p><br />  <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/6292/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/6292/"" /></a> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/6292/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/delicious/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/6292/"" /></a> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gofacebook/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/6292/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/facebook/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/6292/"" /></a> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gotwitter/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/6292/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/twitter/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/6292/"" /></a> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/6292/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/stumble/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/6292/"" /></a> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/6292/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/digg/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/6292/"" /></a> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/6292/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/reddit/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/6292/"" /></a> <img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=meteuphoric.wordpress.com&#038;blog=8643840&#038;post=6292&#038;subd=meteuphoric&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1"" width=""1"" height=""1"" />",KatjaGrace,katjagrace,KatjaGrace,
kAdisGvvRzah8CFWc,Hiding misinformation in meanings,hiding-misinformation-in-meanings,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/kAdisGvvRzah8CFWc/hiding-misinformation-in-meanings,2016-07-07T06:59:26.000Z,1,0,0,False,False,,"<p><strong>I</strong></p>
<p>It is hard to spread misinformation, because information spreads too, and they eventually run into each other and explode.</p>
<p>If a person wants to lie then, they can be better off to make words correspond to different things for different people, so that even when people hear the information it sounds the same as the misinformation.</p>
<p>For instance, suppose you buy tea in Alphaland and sell it in Betaland. As a dishonest businessperson, you would like it if the people in Alphaland believed tea was cheaper that people in Betaland believed it was. However if there are two different verbal sentences kicking around about the price of tea, they will eventually run into each other, because sentences can spread fast.</p>
<p>A different solution is to corner the market for tea weighing devices in at least one nation. Then make them all give slightly biased readouts. Now tea costs the same amount per pound in the two places, but you just sell more pounds than you buy. The information and the misinformation both sound like “tea costs $10/lb”. Tea measuring devices cross the sea slower than words, so this might be more sustainable.</p>
<p>Relatedly, if you wanted to not have your children informed about Santa Claus, you might just call him something else—e.g. Joulupukki—in your home. If you want, you can tell them there is a probable faker called Santa Clause and it is a matter of controversy whether he is the real deal like Joulupukki. Because words refer to unusual things, the information—‘Santa Clause isn’t real’—sounds just like your misinformation.</p>
<p>This can really only work if people are sufficiently isolated that the differences in meanings don’t become obvious, but that sometimes happens.</p>
<p><strong>II</strong></p>
<p>I’m not much in favor of misinformation. But one time I was young and desperate and I did something like this.</p>
<p>From when I was a young teenager I was substantially in charge of raising my three younger brothers, and (because I was not a good necromancer) I had to keep the violence within certain limits.</p>
<p>First (I think) I tried to be nice. I sat down and talked to them about what had happened, and if someone had clearly been vicious, I sent him to his room or something. But it seemed that only punishing people who are clearly guilty leads to not-very-conscionable levels of violence to innocent children.</p>
<p>I pondered justice and mercy. I construed the situation game theoretically. I experimented with different rules and punishment regimes. The children bit themselves just to spite each other (I think).</p>
<p>I gave up on figuring out guilt, and tried just sending everyone to their room for every fight. They started fights just to see the innocent victim punished. They also destroyed parts of the house and its contents if they were annoyed about being sent to their rooms unjustifiedly, so sending people to their rooms was kind of costly.</p>
<p>I wondered whether children are oblivious to incentives, or just wisely refuse to negotiate with authorities, forcing the authorities to give up. But I couldn’t really give up, because I didn’t have any other options (I was a step ahead in the not negotiating, as the children might have realized if they had read Schelling).</p>
<p>This all took up a lot of the time that I wasn’t at school, if I recall. Every time I would sit down to read a book or something, I would be interrupted by shrieking. I really don’t like shrieking. At this point, I don’t even like the sound of joyful childish laughter, I think because I associate it with joyful childish unapologetic cruelty and hatred. But furthermore, I don&#8217;t like being interrupted every five minutes to have a big argument with some children. So I really didn&#8217;t like this situation.</p>
<p>My brothers were &#8216;meant to&#8217; go to bed in the evening. If I started encouraging them to go to bed at about 10pm, that gave the four of us enough time to argue about whether they should or not for three hours before an adult came home and became angry about how the children weren’t in bed. At which point my brothers would go to bed, because the adults were bigger and more exhausted and more authoritative than me.</p>
<p>At some point I realized I had been thinking about things all wrong. All peace really required was for my brothers to believe that it was almost 1am. And my brothers’ beliefs about what time it was were almost entirely dependent on seven or so clocks. And clocks have little dials on the back of them that you can turn around to change where their hands are.</p>
<p>It was somewhat complicated, because there were a bunch of external signs about what time it was. For instance, school would end at 3pm or so. So it had to be 3.30 or so when the children returned home. After that I would gradually change all seven or so visible clocks in the house forward half an hour or an hour at a time, several times through the afternoon and evening. Then by about 8pm it would be past midnight, and the children would hurry off to bed before any adults came home. Then I would get hours (!!!) of solitude (!!!) and peace (!!!)</p>
<p>This was somewhat complicated by the TV schedule, which I said must have been printed for a state in a different time zone with somewhat different programming.</p>
<p>It was also complicated by me messing up one time, and my brother noticing that it was still light at midnight. But a conspiracy didn’t occur to him, and he dismissed it as ‘funny weather today’.</p>
<p>Ultimately the entire scheme was short lived, but only ended by my mother and stepfather objecting to it. My brothers didn&#8217;t suspect until I told them about it later.</p>
<p>So, that’s another example. I sometimes wonder if there is more of this kind of thing in the world.</p><br />  <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/10685/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/10685/"" /></a> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/10685/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/delicious/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/10685/"" /></a> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gofacebook/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/10685/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/facebook/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/10685/"" /></a> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gotwitter/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/10685/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/twitter/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/10685/"" /></a> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/10685/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/stumble/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/10685/"" /></a> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/10685/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/digg/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/10685/"" /></a> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/10685/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/reddit/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/10685/"" /></a> <img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=meteuphoric.wordpress.com&#038;blog=8643840&#038;post=10685&#038;subd=meteuphoric&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1"" width=""1"" height=""1"" />",KatjaGrace,katjagrace,KatjaGrace,

<p>In our July Dojo we look at Soldier Mindset and Scout Mindset – being a partisan advocate for your side versus genuinely seeking for understanding. This includes watching a TED talk by Julia Galef (www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD5WxbIKMXw), some brief reading material and lively discussion groups.</p>

<p>We'll finish with some strategic self-improvement (with some options, none of which involve walking across hot coals or being forced to cry).</p>

<p>At about 6:30pm some of us will probably have dinner in the CBD, and you are welcome to join us.</p>

<p><strong>WHERE</strong>: Ross House, 247 Flinders Lane. Level 4, Room 4.1, Hayden Raysmith Room. (Just this month we're in a different room.)</p>

<p>If you have any trouble finding the venue or getting in, text or call Chris on 0439 471 632. For the greatest convenience and most prompt service, please arrive before 4 pm - that also gives us more chance to catch up before things start.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?</strong>: The Less Wrong Melbourne Rationality Dojos are self-improvement sessions for those committed to the art of rationality and personal growth. We welcome new members who are interested in exploring rationality. We're all ""aspiring rationalists"".</p>

<p>Dojos are <em>usually</em> held on the first Saturday of each month, so you may wish to add that as a recurring event in your calendar.</p></div>

</style></head><body><p><em>A putative new idea for AI control; index <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=601"">here</a></em>.</p>
<p>Any suggestions for refining this model are welcome!</p>
<p>Somewhat inspired by the <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=873"">previous post</a>, this is a model of human bias that can be used to test theories that want to compute the ""true"" human preferences. The basic idea is to formalise the question:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the AI can make the human give any answer to any question, can it figure out what humans really want?</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h1>The AI's influence</h1>
<p>The AI has access to an algorithm <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""H""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.057em;"">H</span></span></span></span></span></span>, representing the human.

<p style=""text-align:left;""><em>You are scared that you might be ostracized from the group</em></p>
<p>But I feel shame about things that other people don&#8217;t even care about.</p>
<p style=""text-align:left;""><em>You are scared that you <strong>should</strong> be ostracized from the group.</em></p>
<p>That seems unrelated to the social realities. Why would evolution bother to equip me with a feeling for that?</p>
<p style=""text-align:left;""><em>Because you need to be able to justify yourself verbally. It is important that you think you should not be ostracized, so you can argue for it. Even if nobody shares your standards, if other people try to ostracize you for some stupid reason and you—for other reasons—believe that you really should be ostracized, then you are in trouble. You want to believe wholeheartedly that you are worthy of alliance.

M5QQZT4enxqiSNnye,[LINK] Concrete problems in AI safety,link-concrete-problems-in-ai-safety,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/M5QQZT4enxqiSNnye/link-concrete-problems-in-ai-safety,2016-07-05T21:33:08.341Z,26,16,6,False,False,,"<p>From the <a href=""https://research.googleblog.com/2016/06/bringing-precision-to-ai-safety.html"">Google Research blog</a>:</p>
<p>We believe that AI technologies are likely to be overwhelmingly useful and beneficial for humanity. But part of being a responsible steward of any new technology is thinking through potential challenges and how best to address any associated risks. So today we&rsquo;re publishing a technical paper, <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06565"">Concrete Problems in AI Safety</a>, a collaboration among scientists at Google, OpenAI, Stanford and Berkeley.</p>
<p>While possible AI safety risks have received a lot of public attention, most previous discussion has been very hypothetical and speculative. We believe it&rsquo;s essential to ground concerns in real machine learning research, and to start developing practical approaches for engineering AI systems that operate safely and reliably.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve outlined five problems we think will be very important as we apply AI in more general circumstances. These are all forward thinking, long-term research questions -- minor issues today, but important to address for future systems:</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Avoiding Negative Side Effects: How can we ensure that an AI system will not disturb its environment in negative ways while pursuing its goals, e.g. a cleaning robot knocking over a vase because it can clean faster by doing so?</li>
<li>Avoiding Reward Hacking: How can we avoid gaming of the reward function? For example, we don&rsquo;t want this cleaning robot simply covering over messes with materials it can&rsquo;t see through.</li>
<li>Scalable Oversight: How can we efficiently ensure that a given AI system respects aspects of the objective that are too expensive to be frequently evaluated during training? For example, if an AI system gets human feedback as it performs a task, it needs to use that feedback efficiently because asking too often would be annoying.</li>
<li>Safe Exploration: How do we ensure that an AI system doesn&rsquo;t make exploratory moves with very negative repercussions? For example, maybe a cleaning robot should experiment with mopping strategies, but clearly it shouldn&rsquo;t try putting a wet mop in an electrical outlet.</li>
<li>Robustness to Distributional Shift: How do we ensure that an AI system recognizes, and behaves robustly, when it&rsquo;s in an environment very different from its training environment? For example, heuristics learned for a factory workfloor may not be safe enough for an office.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>We go into more technical detail in the paper. The machine learning research community has already thought quite a bit about most of these problems and many related issues, but we think there&rsquo;s a lot more work to be done.</p>
<p>We believe in rigorous, open, cross-institution work on how to build machine learning systems that work as intended. We&rsquo;re eager to continue our collaborations with other research groups to make positive progress on AI.</p>",Stuart_Armstrong,stuart_armstrong,Stuart_Armstrong,

<p><em>Time: 22:56:47</em></p>
<p><strong>I</strong></p>
<p>This is going to be an exercise in speed writing a LW post.</p>
<p>Not writing posts at all seems to be worse than writing poorly edited posts.</p>
<p>It is currently hard for me to do anything that even resembles actual speed writing: even as I type this sentence, I have a very hard to resist urge to check it for grammar mistakes and make small corrections/improvements before I've even finished typing.</p>
<p>But to reduce the burden of writing, I predict it is going to be highly useful to develop the ability of actually writing a post as fast as I can type, without going back.</p>
<p>If this proves to have acceptable results, you can expect more regular posts from me in the future.</p>
<p>And possibly, if I develop the habit of writing regularly, I'll finally get to describing some of the topics on which I have (what I believe are) original and sizable clusters of knowledge, which is not easily available somewhere else.</p>
<p>But for now, just some thoughts on a very particular aspect of modelling how human brains think about a very particular thing.</p>
<p>This thing is immense suffering.</p>
<p><em>Time: 23:03:18</em></p>
<p><em>(Still slow!)</em></p>
<p><strong>II</strong></p>
<p>You might have heard this or similar from someone, possibly more than once in your life:</p>
<p>""you have no idea how I feel!""</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>""you can't even imagine how I feel!""</p>
<p>For me, this kind of phrase has always had the ring of a challenge. I have a potent imagination, and non-negligible experience in the affairs of humans. Therefore, I am certainly able to imagine how you feel, am I not?</p>
<p>Not so fast.</p>
<p><em>(Note added later: as Gram_Stone mentions, these kinds of statements tend to be used in epistemically unsound arguments, and as such can be presumed to be suspicious; however here, I am more concerned with the fact of the matter of how imagination works.)</em></p>
<p>Let's back up a little bit and recount some simple observations about imagining numbers.</p>
<p>You might be able to imagine and hold the image of five, six, nine, or even sixteen apples in your mind.</p>
<p>If I tell you to imagine something more complex, like pointed arrows arranged in a circle, you might be able to imagine four, or six, or maybe even eight of them.</p>
<p>If your brain is constructed differently from mine, you might easily go higher with the numbers.</p>
<p>But at some fairly small number, your mental machinery simply no longer has the capacity to imagine more shapes.</p>
<p><strong>III</strong></p>
<p>However, if I tell you that ""you can't even imagine 35 apples!"" it is obviously not an insult or a challenge, and what is more:</p>
<p>""imagining 35 apples"" is NOT EQUAL to ""comprehending in every detail what 35 apples are""</p>
<p>I.e. depending on how good your knowledge of natural numbers is, that is to say, if you passed the first class of primary school, you can analyse the situation of ""35 apples"" in every possible way, and imagine it partially - but not all of it at the same time.</p>
<p>Directly imagining apples is very similar to actually experiencing apples in your life, but it has a severe limitation.</p>
<p>You can experience 35 apples in your life, but you can't imagine all of them at once even if you saw them 3 seconds ago.</p>
<p><em>Meta: I think I'm getting better at not stopping when I write.</em></p>
<p><em>Time: 23:13:00</em></p>
<p><strong>IV</strong></p>
<p>But, you ask, what is the point of writing all this obvious stuff about apples?</p>
<p>Well, if you move to more emotionally charged topics, like someone's emotions, it is much harder to think about the situation in a clear way.</p>
<p>And if you have a clear model of how your brain processes this information, you might be able to respond in a more effective way.</p>
<p>In particular, you might be saved from feeling guilty or inadequate about not being able to imagine someone's feelings or suffering.</p>
<p>It is a simple fact about your brain that it has a limited capability to imagine emotion.</p>
<p>And especially with suffering, the amount of suffering you are able to experience IS OF A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ORDER OF MAGNITUDE than the amount you are able to imagine, even with the best intentions and knowledge.</p>
<p>However, can you comprehend it?</p>
<p><strong>V</strong></p>
<p>From this model, it is also immediately obvious that the same thing happens when you think about your own suffering in the past.</p>
<p>We know generally that humans can't remember their emotions very well, and their memories don't correlate very well with reported experience-in-the-moment.</p>
<p>Based on my personal experience, I'll tentatively make some bolder claims.</p>
<p>If you have suffered a tremendous amount, and then enough time has passed to ""get over it"", your brain is not only unable to imagine how much you have suffered in the past:</p>
<p>it is also unable to comprehend the amount of suffering.</p>
<p>Yes, even if it's your own suffering.</p>
<p>And what is more, I propose that the exact mechanism of ""getting over something"" is more or less EQUIVALENT to losing the ability to comprehend that suffering.</p>
<p>The same would (I expect) hold in case of getting better after severe PTSD etc.</p>
<p><strong>VI</strong></p>
<p>So in this sense, a person telling you ""you cannot even imagine how I feel"" is right also with a less literal interpretation of their statement.</p>
<p>If you are a mentally healthy individual, not suffering any major traumas etc., I suggest your brain literally has a defense mechanism (that protects your precious mental health) that makes it impossible for you to not only imagine, but also fully comprehend the amounts of suffering you are being told about.</p>

If I say ‘The Strategy of Conflict is pretty good’ I am betting some reputation on you liking it if you look at it. If you do like it, you will think better of me, and if you don’t, you will think worse. Even if I just say ‘it’s raining’, I’m staking my reputation on this. If it isn’t raining, you will think there is something wrong with me. If it is raining, you will decrease your estimate of how many things are wrong with me the teensiest bit.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">If we have reputation bets all the time, why would it be so great to have more money bets? </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Because reputation bets are on a limited class of propositions. They are all of the form ’doing X will make me look good’. This is pretty close to betting that an observer will endorse X. Such bets are most useful for statements that are naturally about what the observer will endorse. For instance (a) ’you would enjoy this blog’ is pretty close to (b) ‘you will endorse the claim that you would enjoy this blog&#8217;. It isn’t quite the same &#8211; for instance, if the listener refuses to look at the blog, but judges by its title that it is a silly blog, then (a) might be true while (b) is false. But still, if I want to bet on (a), betting on (b) is a decent proxy.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Reputation bets are also fairly useful for statements where the observer will mostly endorse true statements, such as ‘there is ice cream in the freezer’. Reputation bets are much less useful (for judging truth) where the observer is as likely to be biased and ignorant as the person making the statement. For instance, ‘removing height restrictions on buildings would increase average quality of life in our city’. People still do make reputation bets in these cases, but they are betting on their judgment of the other person’s views.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">If the set of things where people mostly endorse true answers is roughly the set where it is pretty clear what the true answer is, then reputation bets do not buy much in the quest for truth. This seems not quite right though. One thing reputation bets do buy is prompting investment in finding out the answer, if it is somewhat expensive but worth finding out if it is a certain way. For instance, if it looks like all the restaurants are closed today so you want to turn around and go home, and I say ‘no, I promise the sushi place will be open’, then I am placing a reputation bet. It wouldn’t have been worth checking before, but my betting increases your credence that it is open, making it worth checking, which in turn provides the incentive for me to bet correctly.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Another place reputation bets are helpful is if a thing will be discovered clearly in the relatively near future, and it is useful to know beforehand. For instance, we can have a whole discussion of what we will do when we get back to my apartment that implies certain facts about my apartment. You can believe these ahead of time, and plan, because you will think worse of me if when we get there it turns out I made the whole thing up.</span></p><br />  <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/10442/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/10442/"" /></a> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/10442/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/delicious/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/10442/"" /></a> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gofacebook/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/10442/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/facebook/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/10442/"" /></a> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gotwitter/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/10442/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/twitter/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/10442/"" /></a> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/10442/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/stumble/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/10442/"" /></a> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/10442/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/digg/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/10442/"" /></a> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/10442/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/reddit/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/10442/"" /></a> <img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=meteuphoric.wordpress.com&#038;blog=8643840&#038;post=10442&#038;subd=meteuphoric&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1"" width=""1"" height=""1"" />",KatjaGrace,katjagrace,KatjaGrace,

qyMbLkCKAhufdWWb2,Good intuitions,good-intuitions,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/qyMbLkCKAhufdWWb2/good-intuitions,2016-07-04T06:56:10.000Z,1,0,0,False,False,,"<p>Sometimes people have &#8216;good intuitions&#8217;. Which is to say something like, across a range of questions, they tend to be unusually correct for reasons that are hard to explain explicitly.</p>
<p>How do people come to have good intuitions? My first guess is that new intuitions are born from looking at the world, and naturally interpreting it using a bunch of existing intuitions. For instance, suppose I watch people talking for a while, and I have some intuitions about how humans behave, what they want, what their body language means, and how strategic people tend to be. Then I might come to have an intuition for how large a part status plays in human interactions, which I could then go on to use in other cases. If I had had different intuitions about those other things, or watched different people talking, I might have developed a different intuition about the relevance of status.</p>
<p>On this model, when a person has consistently unusually good intuitions, it could be that:</p>
<p style=""padding-left:30px;"">A) Their innate intuition forming machinery is good: perhaps they form hypotheses easily, or they avoid forming hypotheses too easily. Or they absorb others&#8217; useful words into their intuitions easily.</p>
<p style=""padding-left:30px;"">B) They had a small number of particularly useful early intuitions, that tend to produce good further intuitions in the presence of the outside world.</p>
<p style=""padding-left:30px;"">C) They have observed more or higher quality empirical data across the areas where they have superior intuitions.</p>
<p style=""padding-left:30px;"">D) They got lucky, and randomly happen to have a lot of good intuitions instead of bad intuitions.</p>
<p>Which of these plays the biggest part seems important, for:</p>

<li><strong>Judging intuitions in hard or unusual areas:</strong> If A), then good intuitions are fairly general. So good intuitions about math (testable) suggest good intuitions about how to avoid existential risk (harder to test). This is decreasingly the case as we move down the alphabet.</li>
<li><strong>Spreading good intuitions:</strong> If B), then it might be possible to distill the small number of core intuitions a person with good intuitions has, and share them with other people.</li>
</ul>
<p>I expect some of all of A-D play a part (and that I have forgotten more possibilities).

Zombies?</a> and it seemed to have some extraneous content. &nbsp;This is a redacted and slightly rewritten version.</p>
<p><a id=""more""></a></p>
<hr />
<p>Your ""zombie"", in the philosophical usage of the term, is putatively a being that is exactly like you in every respect&mdash;identical behavior, identical speech, identical brain; every atom and quark in <em>exactly</em> the same position, moving according to the same causal laws of motion&mdash;<em>except</em> that your zombie is not conscious.</p>
<p>It is furthermore claimed that if zombies are ""conceivable"" (a term over which battles are still being fought), then, purely from our knowledge of this ""conceivability"", we can deduce a priori that consciousness is extra-physical, in a sense to be described below.</p>
<p>See, for example, <a href=""http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/zombies/"">the SEP entry on Zombies</a>.&nbsp; The ""conceivability"" of zombies is accepted by a substantial fraction, possibly a majority, of academic philosophers of consciousness.</p>
<hr />
<p>I once read somewhere, ""You are not the one who speaks your thoughts&mdash;you are the one who <em>hears</em> your thoughts"".</p>
<p>If you conceive of ""consciousness"" as a quiet, passive listening, then the notion of a zombie initially seems easy to imagine.&nbsp; It's someone who lacks the the inner hearer.</p>
<p>Sketching out that intuition in a little more detail:</p>
<p>When you open a refrigerator and find that the orange juice is gone, you think ""Darn, I'm out of orange juice.""&nbsp; The sound of these words is probably represented in your auditory cortex, as though you'd heard someone else say it.</p>
<p>Why do I think the sound of your inner thoughts is represented in the auditory cortex, as if it were a sound you'd heard?&nbsp; Because, for example, native Chinese speakers can remember longer digit sequences than English-speakers.&nbsp; Chinese digits are all single syllables, and so Chinese speakers can remember around ten digits, versus the famous ""seven plus or minus two"" for English speakers.&nbsp; There appears to be a loop of repeating sounds back to yourself, a size limit on working memory in the auditory cortex, which is genuinely phoneme-based.</p>
<p>It's not only conceivable in principle, but possibly possible in the next couple of decades, that surgeons will lay a network of neural taps over someone's auditory cortex and read out their internal narrative. &nbsp;Researchers have already tapped the lateral geniculate nucleus of a cat and reconstructed recognizable visual inputs.</p>
<p>So your zombie, being physically identical to you down to the last atom, will open the refrigerator and form auditory cortical patterns for the phonemes ""Darn, I'm out of orange juice"".&nbsp; On this point, p-zombie advocates agree.</p>
<p>But in the Zombie World, allegedly, there is no one inside to <em>hear;</em> the inner listener is missing.&nbsp; The internal narrative is spoken, but unheard.&nbsp; You are not the one who speaks your thoughts, you are the one who hears them.</p>
<p>The Zombie Argument is that if the Zombie World is<em> possible</em>&mdash;not necessarily physically possible in our universe, just ""possible in theory"", or ""conceivable""&mdash;then consciousness must be extra-physical, something over and above mere atoms.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because even if you knew the positions of all the atoms in the universe, you would still have be told, as a <em>separate </em>and <em>additional </em>fact, that people were conscious&mdash;that they had inner listeners&mdash;that we were not in the Zombie World.</p>
<p>The technical term for the belief that consciousness is there, but has no effect on the physical world, is <em>epiphenomenalism.</em></p>
<p>Though there are other elements to the zombie argument (I'll deal with them below), I think that the intuition of the inner listener is what first persuades people to zombie-ism. &nbsp;The core notion is simple and easy to access:&nbsp; The lights are on but nobody's home.</p>
<p>Philosophers are appealing to the intuition of the quiet, passive inner listener when they say ""Of course the zombie world is imaginable; you know exactly what it would be like.""</p>
<p>But just because you don't see a contradiction in the Zombie World at first glance, it doesn't mean that no contradiction is there. &nbsp;Just because you don't see an internal contradiction <em>yet</em>&nbsp;within some set of generalizations,&nbsp;is no guarantee that you won't see a contradiction in another 30 seconds.&nbsp; ""All odd numbers are prime.&nbsp; Proof:&nbsp; 3 is prime, 5 is prime, 7 is prime...""</p>
<p>So let us ponder the Zombie Argument <em>a little longer</em>:&nbsp; Can we think of a counterexample to the assertion ""Consciousness has no third-party-detectable causal impact on the world""?</p>
<p>If you close your eyes and concentrate on your inward awareness, you will begin to form thoughts, in your internal narrative, along the lines of ""I am aware"" and ""My awareness is separate from my thoughts"" and ""I am not the one who speaks my thoughts, but the one who hears them"" and ""My stream of consciousness is not my consciousness"" and ""It seems like there is a part of me which I can imagine being eliminated without changing my outward behavior.""</p>
<p>You can even say these sentences out loud.&nbsp; In principle, someone with a super-fMRI could probably read the phonemes right out of your auditory cortex; but saying it out loud removes all doubt about whether you have entered the realms of physically visible consequences.</p>
<p>This certainly <em>seems </em>like the inner listener is being <em>caught in the act of listening</em> by whatever part of you writes the internal narrative, a causally potent neural pattern in your auditory cortex, which can eventually move your lips and flap your tongue.</p>
<p>Imagine that a mysterious race of aliens visit you, and leave you a mysterious black box as a gift.&nbsp; You try poking and prodding the black box, but (as far as you can tell) you never elicit a reaction.&nbsp; You can't make the black box produce gold coins or answer questions.&nbsp; So you conclude that the black box is causally inactive:&nbsp; ""For all X, the black box doesn't do X.""&nbsp; The black box is an effect, but not a cause; epiphenomenal, without causal potency.&nbsp; In your mind, you test this general hypothesis to see if the generalization is true in some trial cases, and it seems to be true in every one&mdash;""Does the black box repair computers?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Does the black box boil water?&nbsp; No.""</p>
<p>But you can <em>see</em> the black box; it absorbs light, and weighs heavy in your hand.&nbsp; This, too, is part of the dance of causality.&nbsp; If the black box were wholly outside the causal universe, you wouldn't be able to see it; you would have no way to know it existed; you could not say, ""Thanks for the black box.""&nbsp; You didn't <em>think</em> of this counterexample, when you formulated the general rule:&nbsp; ""All X: Black box doesn't do X"".&nbsp; But it was there all along.</p>
<p>(Actually, the aliens left you another black box, this one purely epiphenomenal, and you haven't the slightest clue that it's there in your living room.&nbsp; That was their joke.)</p>
<p>If something has no causal effect, you can't know about it. &nbsp;The territory must be causally entangled with the map for the map to correlate with the territory. &nbsp;To 'see' something is to be affected by it. &nbsp;If an allegedly physical thing or property has absolutely no causal impact on the rest of our universe, there's <a href=""/lw/f1u/causal_reference/"">a serious question about whether we can even talk about it</a>, never mind justifiably knowing that it's there.</p>
<p>It is a <a href=""http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/zombies/"">standard point</a>&mdash;which zombie-ist philosophers accept!&mdash;that the Zombie World's philosophers, being atom-by-atom identical to our own philosophers, write identical papers about the philosophy of consciousness.</p>
<p>At this point, the Zombie World stops being an intuitive consequence of the idea of an inner listener.</p>
<p>Philosophers writing papers about consciousness would <em>seem</em> to be at least one effect of consciousness upon the world.&nbsp; You can argue clever reasons why this is not so, but you have to be clever. &nbsp;You are no longer playing straight to the intuition.</p>
<p>Let's say you'd never heard of the Zombie World and never formed any explicit generalizations about how zombies are supposed to exist. &nbsp;The thought might spontaneously occur to you that, as you stand and watch a beautiful sunset, your awareness of your awareness could be subtracted from you without changing your outward smile. &nbsp;But then ask whether you still think ""I am aware of my inner awareness"", as a neural pattern in your auditory cortex, and then say it out loud, after the inner awareness has been subtracted. &nbsp;I would not expect the generalization ""my inner awareness has no effect on physical things"" to still seem intuitive past that point, if you'd never been explicitly indoctrinated with p-zombieism.</p>
<p>Intuitively, we'd suppose that if your inward awareness vanished, your internal narrative would no longer say things like ""There is a mysterious listener within me,"" because the mysterious listener would be gone and you would not be thinking about it.&nbsp; It is usually immediately&nbsp;<em>after</em> you focus your awareness on your awareness, that your internal narrative says ""I am aware of my awareness""; which suggests that if the first event never happened again, neither would the second.</p>
<p>Once you <a href=""/lw/p2/hand_vs_fingers/"">see</a> the collision between the general rule that consciousness has no effect, to the specific implication that consciousness has no effect on how <em>you</em>&nbsp;think about consciousness (in any way that affects your internal narrative that you could choose to say out loud), zombie-ism stops being intuitive. &nbsp;It starts requiring you to postulate strange things.</p>
<p>One strange thing you might postulate is that there's a Zombie Master, a god within the Zombie World who surreptitiously takes control of zombie philosophers and makes them talk and write about consciousness.</p>
<p>Human beings often don't sound all that coherent when talking about consciousness.&nbsp; It might not be that hard to fake.&nbsp; Maybe you could take, as a corpus, one thousand human amateurs trying to discuss consciousness; feed them into a sufficiently powerful but non-reflective machine learning algorithm; and get back discourse about ""consciousness"" that sounded as sensible as most humans, which is to say, not very.</p>
<p>But this speech about ""consciousness"" would not be produced <em>within </em>the AI.&nbsp; It would be an&nbsp;<a href=""/lw/l9/artificial_addition/"">imitation</a>&nbsp;of someone else talking. &nbsp;You might as well observe that you can make a video recording of David Chalmers (the most formidable advocate of zombieism) and play back the recording. &nbsp;The&nbsp;<em>cause</em>&nbsp;that <em>shaped</em>&nbsp;the <em>pattern</em>&nbsp;of the&nbsp;words in the video recording was Chalmers's consciousness moving his lips; that shaping cause is merely being transmitted through a medium, like sounds passing through air.</p>
<p>A separate, extra Zombie Master is <em>not</em> what the philosophical Zombie World postulates. &nbsp;It's asserting that the atoms in the brain are quark-by-quark identical, moving under exactly the same physical laws we know; there's no separate, additional Zombie Master AI Chatbot making the lips move in ways that were copied off the real David Chalmers. &nbsp;The zombie you's lips are talking about consciousness <em>for the same causal reason</em>&nbsp;your lips talk about consciousness.</p>
<p>As David Chalmers&nbsp;<a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=0fZZQHOfdAAC&amp;dq=the+conscious+mind&amp;pg=PP1&amp;ots=qjv14gGUOR&amp;sig=98dNHve8xZp-yltM37iN8mgq2AQ&amp;hl=en&amp;prev=http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=the+conscious+mind&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=print&amp;ct=title&amp;cad=one-book-with-thumbnail#PPA180,M1"">writes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Think of my zombie twin in the universe next door. He talks about conscious experience all the time&mdash;in fact, he seems obsessed by it. He spends ridiculous amounts of time hunched over a computer, writing chapter after chapter on the mysteries of consciousness. He often comments on the pleasure he gets from certain sensory qualia, professing a particular love for deep greens and purples. He frequently gets into arguments with zombie materialists, arguing that their position cannot do justice to the realities of conscious experience.</p>
<p>And yet he has no conscious experience at all! In his universe, the materialists are right and he is wrong. Most of his claims about conscious experience are utterly false. But there is certainly a physical or functional explanation of why he makes the claims he makes. After all, his universe is fully law-governed, and no events therein are miraculous, so there must be some explanation of his claims.</p>
<p>...Any explanation of my twin&rsquo;s behavior will equally count as an explanation of my behavior, as the processes inside his body are precisely mirrored by those inside mine. The explanation of his claims obviously does not depend on the existence of consciousness, as there is no consciousness in his world. It follows that the explanation of my claims is also independent of the existence of consciousness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chalmers is not arguing <em>against</em> zombies; those are his actual beliefs!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This paradoxical situation is at once delightful and disturbing.&nbsp; It is not obviously fatal to the nonreductive position, but it is at least something that we need to come to grips&nbsp;with...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would seriously nominate this as the largest bullet ever bitten in the history of time.&nbsp; And that is a backhanded compliment to David Chalmers:&nbsp; A lesser mortal would simply fail to see the implications, or refuse to face them, or rationalize a reason it wasn't so.</p>
<p>Why would anyone bite a bullet that large?&nbsp; Why would anyone postulate unconscious zombies who write papers about consciousness for <em>exactly the same reason</em> that our own genuinely conscious philosophers do?</p>
<p>Not because of the first intuition I wrote about, the intuition of the quiet inner listener.&nbsp; That intuition may say that zombies can drive cars or do math or even fall in love, but it doesn't say that zombies write philosophy papers about their quiet inner listeners.</p>
<p>No, the drive to bite <em>this</em> bullet comes from an entirely different intuition&mdash;the intuition that <a href=""/lw/p3/angry_atoms/"">no matter how many atoms you add up</a>, no matter how many masses and electrical charges interact with each other, they will never <em>necessarily</em> produce a subjective sensation of the mysterious <span style=""color: #ff3300;"">redness</span> of red.&nbsp; It may be a fact about our physical universe (Chalmers says) that putting such-and-such atoms into such-and-such a position, <em>evokes</em> a sensation of <span style=""color: #ff3300;"">redness</span>; but if so, it is not a <em>necessary</em> fact, it is something to be explained above and beyond the motion of the atoms.</p>
<p>But if you consider the second intuition on its own, <em>without </em>the intuition of the quiet listener, it is hard to see why irreducibility implies zombie-ism.&nbsp; Maybe there's just a <em>different kind of stuff,</em> apart from and additional to atoms, that is <em>not</em> causally passive&mdash;a soul that actually <em>does</em> stuff. &nbsp;A soul that plays a real causal role in why we write about ""the mysterious redness&nbsp;of red"".&nbsp; Take out the soul, and... well, assuming you just don't fall over in a coma, you certainly won't write any more papers about consciousness!</p>
<p>This is the position taken by Descartes and most other ancient thinkers:&nbsp; The soul is of a different kind, but it <em>interacts</em> with the body.&nbsp; Descartes's position is technically known as <em>substance dualism</em>&mdash;there is a thought-stuff, a mind-stuff, and it is not like atoms; but it is causally potent, interactive, and leaves a visible mark on our universe.</p>
<p>Zombie-ists are <em>property dualists</em>&mdash;they don't believe in a separate soul; they believe that matter in our universe has additional properties beyond the physical.</p>
<p>""Beyond the physical""?&nbsp; What does that mean?&nbsp; It means the extra properties are there, but they don't influence the motion of the atoms, like the properties of electrical charge or mass.&nbsp; The extra properties are not experimentally detectable by third parties; <em>you</em> know you are conscious, from the <em>inside </em>of your extra properties, but no scientist can ever directly detect this from outside.</p>
<p>So the additional properties are there, but not causally active.&nbsp; The extra properties do not move atoms around, which is why they can't be detected by third parties.</p>
<p>And that's why we can (allegedly) imagine a universe just like this one, with all the atoms in the same places, but the extra properties missing, such that every atom moves the same as before, but no one is conscious.</p>
<p>The Zombie World might not be <em>physically</em> possible, say the zombie-ists&mdash;because it is a fact that all the matter in our universe has the extra properties, or obeys the bridging laws that evoke consciousness&mdash;but <a href=""/lw/pn/zombies_the_movie/"">the Zombie World is logically possible</a>: the bridging laws could have been different.</p>
<p>But why, oh why, say that the extra properties are epiphenomenal and undetectable?</p>
<p>We can put this dilemma very sharply:&nbsp; Chalmers believes that there <em>is</em> something called consciousness, and this consciousness embodies the true and indescribable substance of the mysterious <span style=""color: #ff3300;"">redness</span> of red.&nbsp; It may be a property beyond mass and charge, but it's <em>there</em>, and it <em>is</em> consciousness.&nbsp; Now, having said the above, Chalmers furthermore specifies that this true stuff of consciousness is epiphenomenal, without causal potency&mdash;but <em>why say that?</em></p>
<p>Why say that you could subtract this true stuff of consciousness, and leave all the atoms in the same place doing the same things?&nbsp; If that's true, we need some <em>separate</em> physical explanation for why Chalmers talks about ""the mysterious redness of red"".&nbsp; That is, there exists both a mysterious <span style=""color: #ff3300;"">redness</span> of red, which is extra-physical, and <em>an entirely separate </em>reason,<em> within </em>physics, why Chalmers <em>talks</em> about the ""mysterious redness of red"".</p>
<p>Chalmers does confess that these two things seem like they ought to be related, but why do you need to assert two separate phenomena?&nbsp; Why not just assert one or the other?</p>
<p>Once you've postulated that there is a mysterious <span style=""color: #ff3300;"">redness</span> of red, why not just say that it interacts with your internal narrative and makes you talk about the ""mysterious redness of red""?</p>
<p>Isn't Descartes taking the simpler approach, here?&nbsp; The <em>strictly</em> simpler approach?</p>
<p>Why postulate an extramaterial soul, <em>and then</em> postulate that the soul has no effect on the physical world, <em>and then</em> postulate a mysterious unknown <em>material</em> process that causes your internal narrative to talk about conscious experience?</p>
<p>Why not postulate the true stuff of consciousness which no amount of mere mechanical atoms can add up to, <em>and then,</em> having gone that far already, let this true stuff of consciousness have causal effects like making philosophers talk about consciousness?</p>
<p>I am not endorsing Descartes's view.&nbsp; But at least I can understand where Descartes is coming from.&nbsp; Consciousness seems mysterious, so you postulate a <a href=""http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/08/mysterious-answ.html"">mysterious stuff of consciousness</a>.&nbsp; Fine.</p>
<p>But now the zombie-ists postulate that this mysterious stuff <em>doesn't do anything</em>, so you need a <em>whole new </em>explanation for why you <em>say</em> you're conscious.</p>
<p>That isn't vitalism.&nbsp; That's something so bizarre that vitalists would spit out their coffee.&nbsp; ""When fires burn, they release <a href=""http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/08/fake-causality.html"">phlogiston</a>.&nbsp; <em>But </em>phlogiston doesn't have any experimentally detectable impact on our universe, so you'll have to go looking for a separate explanation of why a fire can melt snow.""&nbsp; <em>What?</em></p>
<p>Are property dualists under the impression that if they postulate a new <em>active </em>force, something that has a causal impact on physics, they will be sticking their necks out too far?</p>
<p>Me, I'd say that if you postulate a mysterious, separate, additional, inherently mental property of consciousness, above and beyond positions and velocities, then, at that point, you have <em>already</em> stuck your neck out.&nbsp; To postulate this stuff of consciousness, and then further postulate that it <em>doesn't do anything</em>&mdash;for the love of cute kittens, <em>why?</em></p>
<p>There isn't even an obvious career motive.&nbsp; ""Hi, I'm a philosopher of consciousness.&nbsp; My subject matter is the most important thing in the universe and I should get lots of funding?&nbsp; Well, it's nice of you to say so, but actually the phenomenon I study doesn't do anything whatsoever.""</p>
<p>Chalmers is one of the most frustrating philosophers I know. &nbsp;He&nbsp;does this really <em>sharp </em>analysis... and then turns left at the last minute.&nbsp; He lays out everything that's wrong with the Zombie World scenario, and then, having reduced the whole argument to smithereens, calmly accepts it.</p>
<p>Chalmers does the same thing when he lays out, in calm detail, the problem with saying that our own beliefs in consciousness are justified, when our zombie twins say exactly the same thing for exactly the same reasons and are wrong.</p>
<p>On Chalmers's theory, Chalmers saying that he believes in consciousness cannot be <a href=""/lw/f1u/causal_reference/"">causally justified</a>; the belief is not <a href=""http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/03/explaining-away.html"">caused by the fact itself</a>, like looking at an actual real sock being the cause of why you say there's a sock.&nbsp; In the absence of consciousness, Chalmers would write the same papers for the same reasons.</p>
<p>On epiphenomenalism, Chalmers saying that he believes in consciousness cannot be justified as the product of a process that systematically outputs true beliefs, because the zombie twin writes the same papers using the same systematic process and is wrong.</p>
<p>Chalmers admits this.&nbsp; Chalmers, in fact, explains the argument in great detail in his book.&nbsp; Okay, so Chalmers has solidly proven that he is not justified in believing in epiphenomenal consciousness, right?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Chalmers writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Conscious experience lies at the center of our epistemic universe; we have access to it <em>directly.</em>&nbsp; This raises the question: what is it that justifies our beliefs about our experiences, if it is not a causal link to those experiences, and if it is not the mechanisms by which the beliefs are formed?&nbsp; I think the answer to this is clear: it is <em>having</em> the experiences that justifies the beliefs. For example, the very fact that I have a red experience now provides justification for my belief that I am having a red experience...</p>
<p>Because my zombie twin lacks experiences, he is in a very different epistemic situation from me, and his judgments lack the corresponding justification.&nbsp; It may be tempting to object that if my belief lies in the physical realm, its justification must lie in the physical realm; but this is a <em>non sequitur.</em> From the fact that there is no justification in the physical realm, one might conclude that the <em>physical </em>portion of me (my brain, say) is not justified in its belief. But the question is whether <em>I</em> am justified in the belief, not whether my <em>brain</em> is justified in the belief, and if property dualism is correct than there is more to me than my brain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So&mdash;if I've got this thesis right&mdash;there's a core you, above and beyond your brain, that believes it is not a zombie, and directly experiences not being a zombie; and so its beliefs are justified.</p>
<p>But Chalmers just <em>wrote all that stuff down,</em> in his very physical book, and so did the zombie-Chalmers.</p>
<p>The zombie Chalmers can't have written the book <em>because</em> of the zombie's core self above the brain; there must be some entirely different reason, within the laws of physics.</p>
<p>It follows that even if there <em>is</em> a part of Chalmers hidden away that is conscious and believes in consciousness, directly and without mediation, there is also a <em>separable subspace</em> of Chalmers&mdash;a causally closed cognitive subsystem that acts entirely <em>within</em> physics&mdash;and this ""outer self"" is what speaks Chalmers's internal narrative, and writes papers on consciousness.</p>
<p>I do not see any way to evade the charge that, on Chalmers's own theory, this separable outer Chalmers is deranged.&nbsp; This is the part of Chalmers that is the same in this world, or the Zombie World; and in either world it writes philosophy papers on consciousness <em>for no valid reason.</em>&nbsp; Chalmers's philosophy papers are not output by that inner core of awareness and belief-in-awareness, they are output by the mere physics of the internal narrative that makes Chalmers's fingers strike the keys of his computer.</p>
<p>And yet this deranged outer Chalmers is writing philosophy papers that <a href=""http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/02/perpetual-motio.html""><em>just happen</em> to be perfectly right</a>, <em>by a separate and additional miracle.</em>&nbsp; Not a logically necessary miracle (then the Zombie World would not be logically possible).&nbsp; A physically contingent miracle, that <em>happens </em>to be true in what we think is our universe, even though science can never distinguish our universe from the Zombie World.</p>
<p>I think I speak for all reductionists when I say <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Huh?</span><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>That's not epicycles.&nbsp; That's, ""Planetary motions follow these epicycles&mdash;but epicycles don't actually <em>do </em>anything&mdash;there's something else that makes the planets move the same way the epicycles say they should, which I haven't been able to explain&mdash;and by the way, I would say this even if there weren't any epicycles.""</p>
<p>According to Chalmers, the causally closed system of Chalmers's internal narrative is (mysteriously) malfunctioning in a way that, not by necessity, but just in <em>our</em> universe, miraculously happens to be correct.&nbsp; Furthermore, the internal narrative asserts ""the internal narrative is mysteriously malfunctioning, but miraculously happens to be correctly echoing the justified thoughts of the epiphenomenal inner core"", and again, in <em>our</em> universe, miraculously happens to be correct.</p>
<p><em>Oh, come on!</em></p>
<p>Shouldn't there come a point where you just give up on an idea?&nbsp; Where, on some raw intuitive level, you just go:&nbsp; <em>What on Earth was I thinking?</em></p>
<p>Humanity has accumulated some broad experience with what correct theories of the world look like.&nbsp; <em>This is not what a correct theory looks like.</em></p>
<p>""Argument from incredulity,"" you say.&nbsp; Fine, you want it spelled out?&nbsp; The said Chalmersian theory postulates multiple unexplained complex miracles.&nbsp; This drives down its prior probability, by the <a href=""http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/09/burdensome-deta.html"">conjunction rule of probability</a> and <a href=""http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/09/occams-razor.html"">Occam's Razor</a>.&nbsp; It is therefore dominated by at least two theories which postulate fewer miracles, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>Substance dualism: 
<ul>
<li>There is a stuff of consciousness which is not yet understood, an extraordinary super-physical stuff that <em>visibly affects</em> our world; and this stuff is what makes us talk about consciousness.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/01/gray-fallacy.html"">Not-quite-faith-based</a> reductionism: 
<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/04/reductive-refer.html"">That-which-we-name</a> ""consciousness"" happens <em>within</em> physics, in a way not yet understood, just like what happened the last three thousand times humanity ran into something mysterious.</li>
<li>Your intuition that no material substance can possibly <a href=""http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/03/wrong-questions.html"">add up</a> to consciousness is incorrect.&nbsp; If you <em>actually </em>knew <em>exactly</em> why you talk about consciousness, this would give you new insights, of a form you can't now anticipate; and afterward you would realize that your arguments about normal physics having no room for consciousness were <a href=""http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/03/dissolving-the.html"">flawed</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Compare to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Epiphenomenal property dualism: 
<ul>
<li>Matter has additional consciousness-properties which are not yet understood.&nbsp; These properties are epiphenomenal with respect to ordinarily observable physics&mdash;they make no difference to the motion of particles.</li>
<li><em>Separately</em>, there exists a not-yet-understood reason <em>within normal physics</em> why philosophers talk about consciousness and invent theories of dual properties.</li>
<li><em>Miraculously,</em> when philosophers talk about consciousness, the bridging laws of <em>our </em>world are exactly right to make this talk about consciousness correct, even though it arises from a malfunction (drawing of logically unwarranted conclusions) in the causally closed cognitive system that types philosophy papers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I know I'm speaking from limited experience, here.&nbsp; But based on my limited experience, the Zombie Argument may be a candidate for <em>the most deranged idea in all of philosophy.</em></p>
<p>There are times when, as a rationalist, you have to believe things that <a href=""http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/05/think_like_real.html"">seem weird</a> to you.&nbsp; Relativity seems weird, quantum mechanics seems weird, <a href=""http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/11/an-alien-god.html"">natural selection</a> seems weird.</p>
<p>But these weirdnesses are pinned down by massive evidence.&nbsp; There's a difference between believing something weird because science has confirmed it overwhelmingly&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;versus believing a proposition that seems downright deranged, because of a great big complicated philosophical argument centered around unspecified miracles and giant blank spots not even claimed to be understood&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;in a case where <em>even if you accept everything that has been told to you so far,</em> afterward the phenomenon will still seem like a mystery and <a href=""http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/08/mysterious-answ.html"">still have the same quality of wondrous impenetrability that it had at the start</a>.</p>
<p>The correct thing for a rationalist to say at this point, if all of David Chalmers's arguments seem individually plausible, is:</p>
<p>""Okay... I don't know how consciousness works... I admit that... and maybe I'm approaching the whole problem wrong, or asking the wrong questions... but this zombie business <em>can't possibly be right.</em>&nbsp; The arguments aren't nailed down enough to make me believe this&mdash;especially when accepting it won't make me feel any less confused.&nbsp; On a core gut level, this just <em>doesn't look</em> like the way reality could <em>really really</em> work.""</p>
<p>But this is not what I say, for I don't think the arguments are plausible. &nbsp;""In general, all odd numbers are prime"" looked ""conceivable"" when you had only thought about 3, 5, and 7. &nbsp;It stopped seeming reasonable when you thought about 9.</p>
<p>Zombies looked conceivable when you looked out at a beautiful sunset and thought about the quiet inner awareness inside you watching that sunset, which seemed like it could vanish without changing the way you walked or smiled; obedient to the plausible-sounding generalization, ""the inner listener has no outer effects"". &nbsp;That generalization should <em>stop&nbsp;</em>seeming possible when you say out loud, ""But wait, I am thinking this thought right now inside my auditory cortex, and that thought can make my lips move, translating my awareness of my quiet inner listener into a motion of my lips, meaning that consciousness is part of the minimal closure of causality in this universe."" &nbsp;I can't think of anything else to say about the conceivability argument. &nbsp;The zombies are dead.</p>",Eliezer_Yudkowsky,eliezer_yudkowsky,Eliezer Yudkowsky,

Philosopher Eric Shwitzgebel has <a href=""https://aeon.co/essays/how-often-do-ethics-professors-call-their-mothers"">investigated</a> this at some length and basically says no. He suggests this is because ethicists think of themselves as employed to think about ethics, not to be personally more ethical, and they are just not any more ethically ambitious than other people.</p>
<p>To find out if ethicists are more ethical, he <a href=""http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzPapers/BehEth-140123a.pdf"">checked</a> how well they behave according to commonly held moral views. How much they steal library books, how much they call their mothers, how often they eat meat, and so on.</p>
<p>This seems like a poor way to judge the ethicalness of ethicists. Unless I am mistaken, the whole point of doing ethics research is to change our understanding of ethics. Successful ethics research then should lead to aiming to be &#8216;less ethical&#8217;, all things equal, if the measure of ethicalness is agreement with pre-existing or commonsense ethical norms.</p>
<p>Similarly, if your navigator directs you along a different route to the one you would have guessed, this suggests your navigator might actually be adding value.</p>
<p>The more troubling claim is that ethicists are apparently about as ethical as other people, rather than less ethical. This is not all that damning, since popular ethics is mostly deontological, and you could rearrange a lot of human behavior without much affecting adherence to a few deontological constraints. For instance, you can change which charities you give to substantially without affecting whether you give to charity and whether you kill anyone directly. Also, presumably a given ethicist studies some narrow set of activities, and is unlikely to have made progress on <a href=""https://meteuphoric.wordpress.com/2010/05/11/not-mothers-day/"">calling her mother aberrantly</a> or whatever you happen to ask her about.</p>
<p>Ethicists like Peter Singer do manage to have <a href=""http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/16/peter-singer-princeton-bioethics-professor-faces-c/"">views</a> that at least sound like an ethical step backwards to the average person. Which seems like a good sign about whether they might be getting anywhere with the research.</p>
<p>I actually doubt that ethicists are much more ethical than other people. I just object to concluding that they are not with experiments that wouldn&#8217;t tell you if they were.</p><br />  <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/7280/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/7280/"" /></a> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/7280/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/delicious/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/7280/"" /></a> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gofacebook/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/7280/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/facebook/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/7280/"" /></a> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gotwitter/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/7280/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/twitter/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/7280/"" /></a> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/7280/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/stumble/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/7280/"" /></a> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/7280/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/digg/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/7280/"" /></a> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/7280/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/reddit/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/7280/"" /></a> <img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=meteuphoric.wordpress.com&#038;blog=8643840&#038;post=7280&#038;subd=meteuphoric&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1"" width=""1"" height=""1"" />",KatjaGrace,katjagrace,KatjaGrace,

<p>A basic plane has N rows of M seats, divided by an aisle. For instance, maybe N=50 and M=6.</p>

First, about two thirds of the people positioned next to the aisle stand up and prepare their items to leave. Then the first two or so walk off the plane (the people from seats x and w in the diagram). Then the two people in seats v and y get out, prepare their things, and walk off. Then u and z do that. Then the next couple of people in the original queue walk off, allowing the people in their row to climb out, get their stuff, and leave. And so on, for every row.</p>
<p>Let:<br />
A be the time it takes to prepare one’s things to go<br />
B be the time it takes to walk one seat forward in the plane (such that it takes the last person NB to walk from their seat to the front of the plane)</p>
<p>Then the time it takes for the usual procedure is:</p>
<p>time for one row to depart * number of rows + time for last person to walk off</p>
<p>= number of people in a row * time to take your stuff and step forward for the next person to get out * number of rows + number of rows * time to walk forward one row</p>
<p>= M(A+B) * N + BN</p>
<p>= AMN + BMN + BN</p>
<p>Here is an alternative method. Everyone in row Q stands and collects their things. They all walk off the plane. Row R stands and repeats the process. And so on.</p>
<p>Here is how long this procedure would take:</p>
<p>time for one column to depart * number of columns</p>
<p>= (time for a person to get their stuff + time for each person to move one seat forward, allowing the person behind them to start walking + time for the last person to walk all the way off) * number of columns</p>
<p>= (A + B(2N-1)) * M</p>
<p>= AM + 2BMN &#8211; BM</p>
<p>(In both cases I assumed that each person can only start walking forward after the person in front of them has moved one seat forward. So the last person in line takes B(N-1) time to start moving, and then BN time to get out. This is probably not quite right, but near enough.)</p>
<p>It might not be intuitively obvious, but in general AMN + BMN + BN is much bigger than AM + 2BMN &#8211; BM, if we assume it takes substantially longer to collect your bags than it does to walk a couple of steps forward. In fact, it is (A-B)M(N-1) + BN bigger, if we assume that I can do algebra.</p>
<p>For example if there are fifty rows (N = 50) of 6 seats (M = 6), and gathering your stuff takes ten seconds, and walking forward one seat takes one second, we have:</p>
<p>usual method<br />
= AMN + BMN + BN<br />
= 10*6*50 + 1*6*50 + 1*50<br />
= 3350 seconds</p>
<p>alternative method<br />
= AM + 2BMN &#8211; BM<br />
= 10*6 + 2*6*50*1 &#8211; 1*6<br />
= 654 seconds</p>
<p>Intuitively, if a whole column can get their stuff together at once, that is a lot faster than everyone standing waiting while one person at the front gets their stuff. It’s bad if A gets multiplied by MN.</p>
<p>Each method is bottlenecked by something happening MN times &#8211; as many times as there are seats on the plane. In one case, we are bottlenecked by each person taking their stuff down one at a time and then taking a step forward. In the other, it is just the time it takes to walk forward one seat.</p>
<p>You can’t hope to be faster than about 2BMN: the time it would take for every person to walk off the plane in single file if they wait for the person ahead of them to move one seat forward before they start walking. So my proposed method is not much worse than theoretically optimal.</p>
<p>You might notice that the time to completely empty the plane isn’t the same as the time lost, because how bad it is for the plane to not be emptied yet depends on how many people there are still in it. If people leave fairly evenly throughout the disembarking process, the utilitarian cost is roughly time*total people/2. Intuitively, each person is there for half the time the plane is disembarking. This means the total time is proportional to the value lost, so we can ignore this factor. People don’t quite get out evenly throughout the process in these two procedures, but near enough.</p>
<p>Probably the algebra in this post is wrong in places, but I think the gist is correct.</p>
<p>So, the alternative method seems superior to me.

<p>Hey guys, I’ve dropped the ball on these but it’s back!
Tell us what you've learned recently, ask for rationalist advice, talk about cool stuff, and so on. (Bonus points from me if you have a cat you can present to the webcam.) I'll post a Google Hangouts link on Facebook close to the time.
We tend to go until late, so if you can't make it for the official time, you're welcome to pop in anyway.
People outside Australia are welcome too! We've heard from New Zealanders, South Americans, Europeans, North Americans...</p></div>

For instance, for much of the day I wrote this I thought I was probably in pain, though I was unsure exactly where, or how bad it was, or if it was really pain instead of something else. To be clear, it was still unpleasant and fairly distracting.</p>
<p>Sometimes I feel like everything is terrible for five minutes or so before figuring out that the problem is that I&#8217;m in physical pain. I even explicitly wonder whether the problem is pain, and decide probably not, before later realizing I was wrong. In such cases I infer that I was in pain all along because it feels more like a picture emerging after staring at a bunch of dots for long enough, rather than something in the world changing. Also, I don&#8217;t have any other good explanation for what was so bad earlier.</p>
<p>I point this out because I think the usual folk theory of pain says that pain is a kind of direct experience that you can&#8217;t really be confused about. If you don&#8217;t know if you are in pain, you aren&#8217;t. Pain is a conscious experience, so being in pain implies being aware that you are in pain. Also knowing what the pain is like. I think I kind of assumed something like this until I paid more attention to my own experiences, or until my own experiences became more incomprehensible on this model. I don&#8217;t have a well worked out alternative model (maybe others do), but I expect it should the possibility of being consciously confused about basically everything.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also curious about whether I am especially unusual in this regard, or just tend to hear from people who are surprised by this. Are you ever unsure whether you are in pain? Are you ever unsure about its characteristics?</p><br />  <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/7387/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/7387/"" /></a> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/7387/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/delicious/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/7387/"" /></a> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gofacebook/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/7387/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/facebook/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/7387/"" /></a> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gotwitter/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/7387/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/twitter/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/7387/"" /></a> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/7387/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/stumble/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/7387/"" /></a> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/7387/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/digg/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/7387/"" /></a> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/7387/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/reddit/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/7387/"" /></a> <img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=meteuphoric.wordpress.com&#038;blog=8643840&#038;post=7387&#038;subd=meteuphoric&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1"" width=""1"" height=""1"" />",KatjaGrace,katjagrace,KatjaGrace,
awB6q4vtBn4oo2kr7,Notes on the Safety in Artificial Intelligence conference,notes-on-the-safety-in-artificial-intelligence-conference,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/awB6q4vtBn4oo2kr7/notes-on-the-safety-in-artificial-intelligence-conference,2016-07-01T00:36:57.309Z,40,26,15,False,False,,"<p>These are my notes and observations after attending the <a class=""imgScanned"" href=""https://www.cmu.edu/safartint/"">Safety in Artificial Intelligence</a> (SafArtInt) conference, which was co-hosted by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and Carnegie Mellon University on June 27 and 28. This isn't an organized summary of the content of the conference; rather, it's a selection of points which are relevant to the control problem. As a result, it suffers from selection bias: it looks like superintelligence and control-problem-relevant issues were discussed frequently, when in reality those issues were discussed less and I didn't write much about the more mundane parts.</p>
<p>SafArtInt has been the third out of a planned <a class=""imgScanned"" href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2016/05/03/preparing-future-artificial-intelligence"">series of four conferences.</a> The purpose of the conference series was twofold: the OSTP wanted to get other parts of the government moving on AI issues, and they also wanted to inform public opinion.</p>
<p>The other three conferences are about near term legal, social, and economic issues of AI. SafArtInt was about near term safety and reliability in AI systems. It was effectively the brainchild of Dr. Ed Felten, the deputy U.S. chief technology officer for the White House, who came up with the idea for it last year. CMU is a top computer science university and many of their own researchers attended, as well as some students. There were also researchers from other universities, some people from private sector AI including both Silicon Valley and government contracting, government researchers and policymakers from groups such as DARPA and NASA, a few people from the military/DoD, and a few control problem researchers. As far as I could tell, everyone except a few university researchers were from the U.S., although I did not meet many people. There were about 70-100 people watching the presentations at any given time, and I had conversations with about twelve of the people who were not affiliated with existential risk organizations, as well as of course all of those who were affiliated. The conference was split with a few presentations on the 27th and the majority of presentations on the 28th. Not everyone was there for both days.</p>
<p>Felten believes that neither ""robot apocalypses"" nor ""mass unemployment"" are likely. It soon became apparent that the majority of others present at the conference felt the same way with regard to superintelligence. The general intention among researchers and policymakers at the conference could be summarized as follows: we need to make sure that the AI systems we develop in the near future will not be responsible for any accidents, because if accidents do happen then they will spark public fears about AI, which would lead to a dearth of funding for AI research and an inability to realize the corresponding social and economic benefits. Of course, that doesn't change the fact that they strongly care about safety in its own right and have significant pragmatic needs for robust and reliable AI systems.</p>
<p>Most of the talks were about verification and reliability in modern day AI systems. So they were concerned with AI systems that would give poor results or be unreliable in the narrow domains where they are being applied in the near future. They mostly focused on ""safety-critical"" systems, where failure of an AI program would result in serious negative consequences: automated vehicles were a common topic of interest, as well as the use of AI in healthcare systems. A recurring theme was that we have to be more rigorous in demonstrating safety and do actual hazard analyses on AI systems, and another was that we need the AI safety field to succeed in ways that the cybersecurity field has failed. Another general belief was that long term AI safety, such as concerns about the ability of humans to control AIs, was not a serious issue.</p>
<p>On average, the presentations were moderately technical. They were mostly focused on machine learning systems, although there was significant discussion of cybersecurity techniques.</p>
<p>The first talk was given by Eric Horvitz of Microsoft. He discussed some approaches for pushing into new directions in AI safety. Instead of merely trying to reduce the errors spotted according to one model, we should look out for ""unknown unknowns"" by stacking models and looking at problems which appear on any of them, a theme which would be presented by other researchers as well in later presentations. He discussed optimization under uncertain parameters, sensitivity analysis to uncertain parameters, and 'wireheading' or short-circuiting of reinforcement learning systems (which he believes can be guarded against by using 'reflective analysis'). Finally, he brought up the concerns about superintelligence, which sparked amused reactions in the audience. He said that scientists should address concerns about superintelligence, which he aptly described as the 'elephant in the room', noting that it was the reason that some people were at the conference. He said that scientists will have to engage with public concerns, while also noting that there were experts who were worried about superintelligence and that there would have to be engagement with the experts' concerns. He did not comment on whether he believed that these concerns were reasonable or not.</p>
<p>An issue which came up in the Q&amp;A afterwards was that we need to deal with mis-structured utility functions in AI, because it is often the case that the specific tradeoffs and utilities which humans claim to value often lead to results which the humans don't like. So we need to have structural uncertainty about our utility models. The difficulty of finding good objective functions for AIs would eventually be discussed in many other presentations as well.</p>
<p>The next talk was given by Andrew Moore of Carnegie Mellon University, who claimed that his talk represented the consensus of computer scientists at the school. He claimed that the stakes of AI safety were very high - namely, that AI has the capability to save many people's lives in the near future, but if there are any accidents involving AI then public fears could lead to freezes in AI research and development. He highlighted the public's irrational tendencies wherein a single accident could cause people to overlook and ignore hundreds of invisible lives saved. He specifically mentioned a 12-24 month timeframe for these issues.</p>
<p>Moore said that verification of AI system safety will be difficult due to the combinatorial explosion of AI behaviors. He talked about meta-machine-learning as a solution to this, something which is being investigated under the direction of Lawrence Schuette at the Office of Naval Research. Moore also said that military AI systems require high verification standards and that development timelines for these systems are long. He talked about two different approaches to AI safety, stochastic testing and theorem proving - the process of doing the latter often leads to the discovery of unsafe edge cases.</p>
<p>He also discussed AI ethics, giving an example 'trolley problem' where AI cars would have to choose whether to hit a deer in order to provide a slightly higher probability of survival for the human driver. He said that we would need hash-defined constants to tell vehicle AIs how many deer a human is worth. He also said that we would need to find compromises in death-pleasantry tradeoffs, for instance where the safety of self-driving cars depends on the speed and routes on which they are driven. He compared the issue to civil engineering where engineers have to operate with an assumption about how much money they would spend to save a human life.</p>
<p>He concluded by saying that we need policymakers, company executives, scientists, and startups to all be involved in AI safety. He said that the research community stands to gain or lose together, and that there is a shared responsibility among researchers and developers to avoid triggering another AI winter through unsafe AI designs.</p>
<p>The next presentation was by Richard Mallah of the Future of Life Institute, who was there to represent ""Medium Term AI Safety"". He pointed out the explicit/implicit distinction between different modeling techniques in AI systems, as well as the explicit/implicit distinction between different AI actuation techniques. He talked about the difficulty of value specification and the concept of instrumental subgoals as an important issue in the case of complex AIs which are beyond human understanding. He said that even a slight misalignment of AI values with regard to human values along one parameter could lead to a strongly negative outcome, because machine learning parameters don't strictly correspond to the things that humans care about.</p>
<p>Mallah stated that open-world discovery leads to self-discovery, which can lead to reward hacking or a loss of control. He underscored the importance of causal accounting, which is distinguishing causation from correlation in AI systems. He said that we should extend machine learning verification to self-modification. Finally, he talked about introducing non-self-centered ontology to AI systems and bounding their behavior.</p>
<p>The audience was generally quiet and respectful during Richard's talk. I sensed that at least a few of them labelled him as part of the 'superintelligence out-group' and dismissed him accordingly, but I did not learn what most people's thoughts or reactions were. In the next panel featuring three speakers, he wasn't the recipient of any questions regarding his presentation or ideas.</p>
<p>Tom Mitchell from CMU gave the next talk. He talked about both making AI systems safer, and using AI to make other systems safer. He said that risks to humanity from other kinds of issues besides AI were the ""big deals of 2016"" and that we should make sure that the potential of AIs to solve these problems is realized. He wanted to focus on the detection and remediation of all failures in AI systems. He said that it is a novel issue that learning systems defy standard pre-testing (""as Richard mentioned"") and also brought up the purposeful use of AI for dangerous things.</p>
<p>Some interesting points were raised in the panel. Andrew did not have a direct response to the implications of AI ethics being determined by the predominantly white people of the US/UK where most AIs are being developed. He said that ethics in AIs will have to be decided by society, regulators, manufacturers, and human rights organizations in conjunction. He also said that our cost functions for AIs will have to get more and more complicated as AIs get better, and he said that he wants to separate unintended failures from superintelligence type scenarios. On trolley problems in self driving cars and similar issues, he said ""it's got to be complicated and messy.""</p>
<p>Dario Amodei of Google Deepbrain, who co-authored the paper on concrete problems in AI safety, gave the next talk. He said that the public focus is too much on AGI/ASI and wants more focus on concrete/empirical approaches. He discussed the same problems that pose issues in advanced general AI, including flawed objective functions and reward hacking. He said that he sees long term concerns about AGI/ASI as ""extreme versions of accident risk"" and that he thinks it's too early to work directly on them, but he believes that if you want to deal with them then the best way to do it is to start with safety in current systems. Mostly he summarized the Google paper in his talk.</p>
<p>In her presentation, Claire Le Goues of CMU said ""before we talk about Skynet we should focus on problems that we already have."" She mostly talked about analogies between software bugs and AI safety, the similarities and differences between the two and what we can learn from software debugging to help with AI safety.</p>
<p>Robert Rahmer of IARPA discussed CAUSE, a cyberintelligence forecasting program which promises to help predict cyber attacks. It is a program which is still being put together.</p>
<p>In the panel of the above three, autonomous weapons were discussed, but no clear policy stances were presented.</p>
<p>John Launchbury gave a talk on DARPA research and the big picture of AI development. He pointed out that DARPA work leads to commercial applications and that progress in AI comes from sustained government investment. He classified AI capabilities into ""describing,"" ""predicting,"" and ""explaining"" in order of increasing difficulty, and he pointed out that old fashioned ""describing"" still plays a large role in AI verification. He said that ""explaining"" AIs would need transparent decisionmaking and probabilistic programming (the latter would also be discussed by others at the conference).</p>
<p>The next talk came from Jason Gaverick Matheny, the director of IARPA. Matheny talked about four requirements in current and future AI systems: verification, validation, security, and control. He wanted ""auditability"" in AI systems as a weaker form of explainability. He talked about the importance of ""corner cases"" for national intelligence purposes, the low probability, high stakes situations where we have limited data - these are situations where we have significant need for analysis but where the traditional machine learning approach doesn't work because of its overwhelming focus on data. Another aspect of national defense is that it has a slower decision tempo, longer timelines, and longer-viewing optics about future events.</p>
<p>He said that assessing local progress in machine learning development would be important for global security and that we therefore need benchmarks to measure progress in AIs. He ended with a concrete invitation for research proposals from anyone (educated or not), for both large scale research and for smaller studies (""seedlings"") that could take us ""from disbelief to doubt"".</p>
<p>The difference in timescales between different groups was something I noticed later on, after hearing someone from the DoD describe their agency as having a longer timeframe than the Homeland Security Agency, and someone from the White House describe their work as being crisis reactionary.</p>
<p>The next presentation was from Andrew Grotto, senior director of cybersecurity policy at the National Security Council. He drew a close parallel from the issue of genetically modified crops in Europe in the 1990's to modern day artificial intelligence. He pointed out that Europe utterly failed to achieve widespread cultivation of GMO crops as a result of public backlash. He said that the widespread economic and health benefits of GMO crops were ignored by the public, who instead focused on a few health incidents which undermined trust in the government and crop producers. He had three key points: that risk frameworks matter, that you should never assume that the benefits of new technology will be widely perceived by the public, and that we're all in this together with regard to funding, research progress and public perception.</p>
<p>In the Q&amp;A between Launchbury, Matheny, and Grotto after Grotto's presentation, it was mentioned that the economic interests of farmers worried about displacement also played a role in populist rejection of GMOs, and that a similar dynamic could play out with regard to automation causing structural unemployment. Grotto was also asked what to do about bad publicity which seeks to sink progress in order to avoid risks. He said that meetings like SafArtInt and open public dialogue were good.</p>
<p>One person asked what Launchbury wanted to do about AI arms races with multiple countries trying to ""get there"" and whether he thinks we should go ""slow and secure"" or ""fast and risky"" in AI development, a question which provoked laughter in the audience. He said we should go ""fast and secure"" and wasn't concerned. He said that secure designs for the Internet once existed, but the one which took off was the one which was open and flexible.</p>
<p>Another person asked how we could avoid discounting outliers in our models, referencing Matheny's point that we need to include corner cases. Matheny affirmed that data quality is a limiting factor to many of our machine learning capabilities. At IARPA, we generally try to include outliers until they are sure that they are erroneous, said Matheny.</p>
<p>Another presentation came from Tom Dietterich, president of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence. He said that we have not focused enough on safety, reliability and robustness in AI and that this must change. Much like Eric Horvitz, he drew a distinction between robustness against errors within the scope of a model and robustness against unmodeled phenomena. On the latter issue, he talked about solutions such as expanding the scope of models, employing multiple parallel models, and doing creative searches for flaws - the latter doesn't enable verification that a system is safe, but it nevertheless helps discover many potential problems. He talked about knowledge-level redundancy as a method of avoiding misspecification - for instance, systems could identify objects by an ""ownership facet"" as well as by a ""goal facet"" to produce a combined concept with less likelihood of overlooking key features. He said that this would require wider experiences and more data.</p>
<p>There were many other speakers who brought up a similar set of issues: the user of cybersecurity techniques to verify machine learning systems, the failures of cybersecurity as a field, opportunities for probabilistic programming, and the need for better success in AI verification. Inverse reinforcement learning was extensively discussed as a way of assigning values. Jeanette Wing of Microsoft talked about the need for AIs to reason about the continuous and the discrete in parallel, as well as the need for them to reason about uncertainty (with potential meta levels all the way up). One point which was made by Sarah Loos of Google was that proving the safety of an AI system can be computationally very expensive, especially given the combinatorial explosion of AI behaviors.</p>
<p>In one of the panels, the idea of government actions to ensure AI safety was discussed. No one was willing to say that the government should regulate AI designs. Instead they stated that the government should be involved in softer ways, such as guiding and working with AI developers, and setting standards for certification.</p>

<p>In between these presentations I had time to speak to individuals and listen in on various conversations. A high ranking person from the Department of Defense stated that the real benefit of autonomous systems would be in terms of logistical systems rather than weaponized applications. A government AI contractor drew the connection between Mallah's presentation and the recent press revolving around superintelligence, and said he was glad that the government wasn't worried about it.</p>
<p>I talked to some insiders about the status of organizations such as MIRI, and found that the current crop of AI safety groups could use additional donations to become more established and expand their programs. There may be some issues with the organizations being sidelined; after all, the Google Deepbrain paper was essentially similar to a lot of work by MIRI, just expressed in somewhat different language, and was more widely received in mainstream AI circles.</p>
<p>In terms of careers, I found that there is significant opportunity for a wide range of people to contribute to improving government policy on this issue. Working at a group such as the Office of Science and Technology Policy does not necessarily require advanced technical education, as you can just as easily enter straight out of a liberal arts undergraduate program and build a successful career as long as you are technically literate. (At the same time, the level of skepticism about long term AI safety at the conference hinted to me that the signalling value of a PhD in computer science would be significant.) In addition, there are large government budgets in the seven or eight figure range available for qualifying research projects. I've come to believe that it would not be difficult to find or create AI research programs that are relevant to long term AI safety while also being practical and likely to be funded by skeptical policymakers and officials.</p>
<p>I also realized that there is a significant need for people who are interested in long term AI safety to have basic social and business skills. Since there is so much need for persuasion and compromise in government policy, there is a lot of value to be had in being communicative, engaging, approachable, appealing, socially savvy, and well-dressed. This is not to say that everyone involved in long term AI safety is missing those skills, of course.</p>
<p>I was surprised by the refusal of almost everyone at the conference to take long term AI safety seriously, as I had previously held the belief that it was more of a mixed debate given the existence of expert computer scientists who were involved in the issue. I sensed that the recent wave of popular press and public interest in dangerous AI has made researchers and policymakers substantially less likely to take the issue seriously. None of them seemed to be familiar with actual arguments or research on the control problem, so their opinions didn't significantly change my outlook on the technical issues. I strongly suspect that the majority of them had their first or possibly only exposure to the idea of the control problem after seeing badly written op-eds and news editorials featuring comments from the likes of Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking, which would naturally make them strongly predisposed to not take the issue seriously. In the run-up to the conference, websites and press releases didn't say anything about whether this conference would be about long or short term AI safety, and they didn't make any reference to the idea of superintelligence.</p>
<p>I sympathize with the concerns and strategy given by people such as Andrew Moore and Andrew Grotto, which make perfect sense if (and only if) you assume that worries about long term AI safety are completely unfounded. For the community that is interested in long term AI safety, I would recommend that we avoid competitive dynamics by (a) demonstrating that we are equally strong opponents of bad press, inaccurate news, and irrational public opinion which promotes generic uninformed fears over AI, (b) explaining that we are not interested in removing funding for AI research (even if you think that slowing down AI development is a good thing, restricting funding yields only limited benefits in terms of changing overall timelines, whereas those who are not concerned about long term AI safety would see a restriction of funding as a direct threat to their interests and projects, so it makes sense to cooperate here in exchange for other concessions), and (c) showing that we are scientifically literate and focused on the technical concerns. I do not believe that there is necessarily a need for the two ""sides"" on this to be competing against each other, so it was disappointing to see an implication of opposition at the conference.</p>
<p>Anyway, Ed Felten announced a request for information from the general public, seeking popular and scientific input on the government's policies and attitudes towards AI: https://www.whitehouse.gov/webform/rfi-preparing-future-artificial-intelligence</p>
<p>Overall, I learned quite a bit and benefited from the experience, and I hope the insight I've gained can be used to improve the attitudes and approaches of the long term AI safety community.</p>",UmamiSalami,umamisalami,UmamiSalami,
